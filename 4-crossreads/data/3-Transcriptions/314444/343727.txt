<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father<br/>Recieved your letter dated 7 June, and was very pleased to hear that you were all well. I am back with the battalion after ten days in Hospital with my tonsils. I had a bad time while they were swollen, but for the remaining five days I was well looked after &amp; had a good time Next time I am near a hospital I will have them taken out<br/>Bye the way I heard Captain Linklater is a prisoner of war. It is pretty correct too<br/>I am feeling tip top and as fit as a fiddle. The allies are going ahead well &amp; if the weather will only keep fine, there will be a big difference in two months. I wish we were moving back to Sydney. I have sent my Medal to Aunt Florrie, as it is too risky to send on to Sydney just yet. Will write again soon.<br/>Hoping you are all keeping well<br/>Heaps of love &amp; kisses<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
