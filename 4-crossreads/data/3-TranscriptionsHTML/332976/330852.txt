<p>May 1917.<br/>2nd   Although the temperature is not much above 40&deg;, we feel it very hot, due to the excissive cold we have had during the winter.   Our work was resumed again with the Bosches to-day &amp; we are making fine progress.<br/>This afternoon the whole section with the exception of two, went down to the photographer in the town &amp; had a group taken, after which Mr. Oliver left us &amp; returned to Mametz.<br/>3rd.   We have made good progress with our work &amp; have started various new ones.  We are enjoying ourselves immensely here &amp; are welcome at all the French houses in the town.   To-night we "found" a billiard table &amp; were invited to have a game whenever we felt inclined.</p>
