  
 1915 Dec. 28 Tue. Went for a jolly long walk this afternoon occupying fully three hours. Through Gezira, Kasr-el-Nil, Garden City, City of Cairo, & back through Kasr-el-Nil & Gezira. Have decided to take up French & Arabic in earnest  & put an advt. in the Egyptian Mail to-day for a teacher. So far I have very slight knowledge of Arabic although I can do better at French notwithstanding the fact that I can get very slight opportunities for conversation.
