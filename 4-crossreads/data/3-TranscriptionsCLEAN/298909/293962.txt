the enemy outposts, were engaged here a few days ago, with only a few casualtys to our men. Here we have anti Air Craft Guns constantly on the lookout & well manned. The Water is turned on at fixed hours & then there is rush, as a man is allowed a water bottle ful per day to drink - clean dishes - Teeth etc. Without a bit of exaggeration you can see daily a string of men 1/4 of mile long waiting for the Bar & the Canteen to open. There is no hope of us getting into L.H.F.A., so we expect to be pushed into Field Ambulance Units. This place is all entrenched - wire entanglements etc. It is near where the Turks tried to rush the Canal after carrying galvanized iron boats across the Desert, these boats were riddled with shot & are now to be seen in Cairo at the Zoological Gardens. The sand here is very fine & white, so it is not too pleasant with the wind & traffic.
I brought a Billy Can from Telekebar & of course they all said I was balmy, an old dog for a hard road, all our Tent had cocoa & Biscuits before going to bed, then they appreciated the Billy.
