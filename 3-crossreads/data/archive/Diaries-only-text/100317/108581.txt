17/6/18
Busy day writing etc. In the evening I met Colonel Brazenor and rode all round our companies with him. On Stewart's horse had a good ride. News today of Hun's attack in Italy. Received about 5 months mail tonight and read it until late. All our Nucleus rejoined the Battalion returning in motor lorries from Bertancourt where they have had a splendid time among the hospitable French people. A few heavy shells coming over and after dark the air was full of humming planes. The big mail tonight filled me with thoughts of good friends in Australia. Some careless devil at the Base, curse him, has bottled my letters for months. We are to make full reconnaissances of the positions around here tomorrow. Busy times these. The men was a rest way, way back drill
