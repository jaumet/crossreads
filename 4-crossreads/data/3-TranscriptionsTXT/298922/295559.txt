 Thursday 6 September 1917 
 Cairo Disappointed  today  again to find  no  boat available for about a fortnight  so cabled Dolly not to expect me till end of month.   Meantime we applied to go to a School "Topographical or Senior Cavalry"  as I cannot afford to be living here in Cairo at the Continental as many expense is ahead of me in my trip home.  
 [The following paragraph crossed through.] I am very happy about it all. Will travel light &amp; am leaving a leather KIT Bag at the Continental Hotel here others at Gezireh so if torpedoed you'll know.
