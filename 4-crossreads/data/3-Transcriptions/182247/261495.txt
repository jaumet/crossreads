<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">on deck and found poor old Dawn just poking through the dark clouds his welcome face.&nbsp; Cold morning.&nbsp; In fact, the whole of to-day was cold enough for the wearing of a top coat on deck.&nbsp; Did more souvenir work.&nbsp; Weather getting dull again.&nbsp; Had light rain in the evening.&nbsp; Had rehearsal in Smoke room for Saturday&#39;s final concert.&nbsp; Wrote letter home at night.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Did more work on souvenir.&nbsp; It is beginning to assume a business like shape and promises to be quite a success if the printing and arrangement is done well.&nbsp; Nothing out of the ordinary happened to-day.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Our duty again.&nbsp; On guard.&nbsp; Happened to be the neatest man on parade before the O.C. and was detailed by him for his orderly for that day as a &quot;penalty&quot; for my trouble and care with my toilet.&nbsp; Spent the day on the souvenir again and was very glad of the opportunity of so doing.&nbsp; Besides it meant being under the decks out of the cold all day and being able to have a smoke when I felt inclined without having to steal it, as it were.&nbsp; We have run into real winter at last.&nbsp; The sea in the last few hours is beginning to rise and shows signs of a heavy blow with thick weather.&nbsp; Latrine wireless abroad that we are to pick up our destroyer convoy to-night at dusk.&nbsp; Pr<sub>^</sub><sup>o</sup>ved to be correct.&nbsp; Just at dusk, as we were all on deck looking ahead of us for a sight which might prove intresting as well as novel.&nbsp; There, sure enough, on the horizon, was a squadron of &quot;wasps&quot; signalling with their searchlight morse signalling apparatus, racing towards us so that they might take us in their protecting wings and safely escort us to a haven of safety, free from the menace of vicious Hun submarine attacks.&nbsp; Can feel the barometer falling every hour.&nbsp; About 9 pm we ran into a howling hurricane with wind at anything from 60 to 80 miles/per hour, I should think, and as cold as ice.&nbsp; Bore it with patience.&nbsp; Got hot tea at 10.30 and 12.45 pm for the Guard and then turned in in the Orderly Room and slept, brokenly, until morning.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Cold and wet and blowing like the very devil.&nbsp; In fact, the weather is dreadful.&nbsp; There is not a warm spot on the ship except the stokehold.&nbsp; It proved too rough to dismiss the guard on the deck.&nbsp; Stood on the poop, on the lee side and watched the antics of men trying to walk along the frozen decks between the intervals of the ship&#39;s heaving and tossing.&nbsp; Many laughable events took place.&nbsp; No parades to-day as it is too rough.&nbsp; Pcaked our bags and were ordered to make all necessary preparations for disembarkation early on the morrow at ---.&nbsp; Much joy and jubilation at the thought</td>
