The view of sunlit Rouen, with Seine sparkling, & the bluffs preen & warmth inspiring, caused Walter to remark that it reminded him of his arrival from Bullicourt by hospital train. It reminded me of the equally pleasant arrival I made at the same place from Marseilles. Looking out over the peaceful urban view I thought of Boulogne & the bombs, & wondered whether the people of Rouen appreciated their immunity from bothers.
