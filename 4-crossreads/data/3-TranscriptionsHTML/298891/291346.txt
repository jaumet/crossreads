<p>20 Thursday</p>
<p>Another awful day &ndash; heart fluttering.  Hot &amp; uncomfortable &amp; a temperature.  Earl ran me out to toilet with a temp. &amp; I could hardly stagger back.  Thank God the pea nut stand was quieter &amp; I slept at night.<br/>Watched the yellow creeping in among the leaves of the elm trees.</p>
