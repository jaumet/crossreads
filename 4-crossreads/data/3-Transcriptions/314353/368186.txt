<p>October 13<br/>49.<br/>Greyness over the skies, and the three trees by us like faint etchings, faintly and timidly drawn and partly coloured yellow green and brown red.</p>
<p>Now the rains heavy, and the only light blown candles.</p>
<p>50.<br/>Poems, Ralph Hodgson<br/>Time you old Gypsy Man.</p>
<p>Time you old gypsy man<br/>Will you not stay,<br/>Put up your caravan<br/>Just for one day?</p>
<p>All things I'll give you<br/>Will you be my guest,<br/>Bells for your jennet<br/>Of silver the best,<br/>Goldsmiths shall beat you<br/>A great golden ring,<br/>Peacocks shall bow to you,<br/>Little boys sing,<br/>Oh, and sweet girls will<br/>Festoon you with may,<br/>Time you old gypsy man,<br/>Why hasten away?</p>
<p>Last week in Babylon<br/>Last night in Rome<br/>Morning, and in the crush<br/>Under Paul's dome:<br/>Under Paul's dial<br/>You tighten your rein &ndash;<br/>Only a moment,<br/>And off once again:<br/>Off to some city<br/>Now blind in the womb.<br/>Off to another,<br/>Ere that's in the tomb.</p>
<p>Oct. 13<br/>"The Song of Honour"</p>
<p>I stared into the sky<br/>As wondering men have always done<br/>Since beauty and the stars were one,<br/>Though none so hard as I.</p>
<p>It seemed, so still the valleys were,<br/>As if the whole world knelt at prayer,<br/>Save me and me alone:<br/>So pure and wide that silence was<br/>I feared to bend a blade of grass,<br/>And there I stood like stone.</p>
<p>I heard the hymn of being sound<br/>From every well of honour found<br/>In human sense and soul:<br/>The song of poets when they write<br/>The testament of Beautysprite<br/>Upon a flying scroll.<br/>The song of painters when they take<br/>A burning brush for Beauty's sake<br/>And limn her features whole.</p>
<p>The song of men all sorts and kinds,<br/>And many tempers, moods and minds<br/>As leaves are on a tree,<br/>And many faiths and castes and creeds,<br/>As many human bloods and breeds<br/>As in the world may be.</p>
<p>The song of each and all who gaze<br/>On Beauty in her naked blaze,<br/>Or see her dimly in a haze,<br/>Or get her light in fitful rays<br/>And tiniest needles even,<br/>The song of all not wholly dark,<br/>Not wholly sunk in stupor stark<br/>Too deep for grasping Heaven.</p>
