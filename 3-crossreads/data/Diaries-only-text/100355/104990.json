To anyone who had seen Hazelbrouck previously ( my old unit had been camped about there for months) the scenes of desolation wrought by the German advances were appalling. Hazelbrouck but for a few soldiers was ruinous dead. Borre where I was stationed with my gun teams lay in close proximity to the line therefore under German batteries, the familiar old ventilator of the mill at Strazule had fallen in the ruins of the place, the churches of Pradelles Caestre once such familiar landmarks now raised scarred almost unrecognisable steeples over their respective battered villages, of the Sec Bois where the old 2nd Batt has rested on the edge of the Nieppe Forest nothing could be made out save crumbling farm buildings.
