 Wednesday 7 November 1917 Bugle call for staff (I think) wakes me 6 a.m.  Feeling better but very weak for duty yet.  Meat for 8 a.m. breakfast.  Capt. C. arrives 9.30 a.m. &amp; says may go down to meals. Lunch 12.30 p.m. an ordeal, all strangers &amp; oh how out of things I feel.  4 p.m. tea in sitting room the same.  All talk is of past experiences Mudros, Gallipoli, Salonica, etc. &ndash; shall I ever I wonder have any experiences to relate?  Weighed 133 lbs = 9 stone 7 lbs, feel about 2 stone as regards strength. My room is a little bit of home with its sweet smelling roses.  Gave most to Home sister for our sitting room.
