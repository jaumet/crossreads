a section of the harbor - I had Suva foreshore on my left & the harbor with the reef in the distance on my right  -  I met the Captain (Moore) on the way but he is far too fat for transport  -  He did a mile & a half & then returned  -  The captain sweated & blowed when really the day was cool & walking perfection  -  I wish the R cd  have been with me to see the flats with birds on them at ebb tide  -  Reef heron & a bird, whose cry I knew from Gayndah, long before I saw him - the sandpiper R & I watched them on the Burnett Sands many an aftn  last year  -  They are a cosmopolitan species  -  R has seen the Screw Pine (Pandanus) - trees on stilts - at Caloundra - also the Mangrove & the black mud they love to live in  -  Well I had a jolly tramp on my own it is true - but it did me good - You meet very few or no whites but Indians & Fijians galore  -  I was at the launch at 6 sharp & soon on board the Upolu  -  Coaling was over & we were only some 400 yds from the beach  -  The ship had been washed down  -  We had dinner & then some Bridge  -  Again I noticed - all eveg  -  one of our officers the worse for drink  -  This is very rotten I think
