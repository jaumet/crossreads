May 7th 1917. Left "Bresle by motor lorrie about 2P.M this afternoon and reached "Amiens" a couple of hours later. Left "Amiens" by Train at 6.30PM and arrived at "Boulogne" about 9P.M.
(8) Left "Boulogne" at 3PM. and arrived at Folkestone England 5.30, left by Train and arrived at Victoria Station London about 9.30P.M. and a party of A.I.F on leave (Special) 10 days were marched to Headquarters were their London addresses were taken and so on. I had to see several heads of Departments to make arrangements about receiving my decoration.
(12) Very funny turnout to day, through a mistake made by the people at Horseferry Road Office I missed the Investiture this morning at the Palace, So I had to see the Lord Chamberlain (Sir Douglas Dawson) at St James palace and arrangements were made so that I should receive my Cross that afternoon. So at 3 o,clock I was taken to Buckingham Palace on my own and after wandering through several Corridors and large, gaudy, Halls etc I was finally ushered into the Kings presence, sure I felt a little excited being all on my own before the King-Emperor of the greatest Empire the world has ever known, (I also felt a wee bit proud of myself when he pinned the Military Cross on my brest and shook me by the hand, exactly what he said to me I cannot quite remember as I was in a sort of fairy-land, I must have been in his presence fully 10 minutes, and he asked me what state I belonged to, if I was married, who I served with in S. Africa, had I been in Gallipoli and
