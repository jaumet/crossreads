Sunday on Board Berrima Church service in morning, afternoon we got leave to go ashore to see Rabaul at our leisure but again the navy interferred stopped it, which caused a great deal of Grumbling among the men considering that we had not a day to ourselves since landing at Herbertshohe we all thought we were entitled to have a bit of time off, The French Sailors went ashore had a look round, all being dressed in White, some of them came on board the Berrima had a look round. The reason given by Gentle Annie being that as the Australian men could not have leave ashore no one else should be allowed to go ashore, fed up at nothing doing, but plenty of hard work on the morrow unloading ship

H. companies ready to go anywhere doing anything or anybody, we go ashore find a place where we can camp, it is a large shed that was being used as a bulk store, we got a lot of niggers at work cleared it right out swept clean. we made ourselves as comfortable as possible, were glad to have a shelter over our heads as the rainy season was just commencing.
