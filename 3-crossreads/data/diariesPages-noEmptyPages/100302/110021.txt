The retaliation from the enemy was as far as we could see practically "nil" though just between us and the firing line we could hear shells bursting. We had just carried on and returned to our dugouts when a faint banging of gongs and ringing of bells sounded. At first its import was not realized then it grew in volume and presently a sentry dashed in "Gas alarm on the left Sir", my helmet was on in a trice and within a few seconds a good many men were out fully equipped and the rest were sitting up in their blankets like divers. The artillery then opened up at a great rate in a fresh bombardment just north of Houplines and there seemed to be merry hell up there.
When it was apparent the gas was not on this front, I gave the "carry on" but instituted a gas alert, doubled all the sentries and made them wear their helmets turban wise and put special men outside each set of dugouts. We discovered that our Strombos Horn in Leith Walk "roared as gently as any sucking dove" When we turned it on owing to some defect in the cylinder so Griffen changed it.
Some of the men have had a very strenuous day today what with their ordinary fatigue which lasted from 3 this morning until 12, and then with an 8 mile march for a bath this afternoon followed by this strenuous night with all its alarms and excursions and the usual "stand tos" to be done.

Stand to arms at 3 am and after that did not sleep too well. A very quiet morning, 50 to the Baths and others on fatigue. Persistent rumours today that the C.O. is going to the 8th Battn. and Watson is coming here also that Mackay is leaving the Regiment.
Being a lovely day the men off duty lay in the sun and loused themselves. Some ?planes up and antiaircraft guns tried for them. Some Taubes (transparent) passed over.
