<p>September 1918.<br/>Sunday 1</p>
<p>Same position<br/>3.30 am Awoke to find Mr Mays flashing a torch in my<br/>eyes. Told that the line was down and that I had to <br/>toddle at the Suites. Went out in the rain to the O.P. Phil <br/>Thresher wounded in face at 7pm. <br/>Had a heave of very heavy stuff across, gas galore.<br/>All "D" subs gunners gassed. Richards and Williams<br/>badly gassed.<br/>Orders came through to the effect that we will have to<br/>cross the Somme tonight. I expect  twill be a very rough<br/>spin, however good luck.<br/>Peronne captured today by 14th Inf  Bdge. <br/>A very dirty outlook tonight. Left home all clear at <br/>7.30pm.</p>
