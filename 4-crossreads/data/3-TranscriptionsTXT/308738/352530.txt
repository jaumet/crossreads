Oct. 12 Tuesday 1915After work went for a long walk around Ras el-Tin,& saw the police drilling. They take their business very seriously & both officers & men look very well, as they drill in a public square. This part is noted for the boat building trade that is carried out, & one can watch the small & large boats being constructed in a very workmanlike manner.
Oct. 13. Wednesday 1915The march past of the Egyptian Lancers & Infantry was splendid. They were headed by a Mounted Band all riding Grey Horses. They certainly were brought up to a high state of discipline & effiecency. The horses belonging to the Mounted Yroops are well kept, & too much praise cannot be given to these fine fellows.Pay day today 7/- receivedLieu Cunningham gone to Pt Said on business
Oct. 14,Thursday 1915Everything working at high pressure owing to the number of wounded letters & lists coming in.went for a walk with Dick Playdell this evening to see the place where our poor fellows are buried. Large trenches are dug & the bodies laid side by side whilst some beautiful stones  are being erected now over some of the favourite ones. Officers are kept apart & have separate graves.
