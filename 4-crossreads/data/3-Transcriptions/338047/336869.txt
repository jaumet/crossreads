<p>1918<br/>Oct 23<br/>up to London some of the old hard heads who had been on leave before commenced making barbed wire tears in their trousers and puttees and rubbing the knees of the trousers out, with knives. They said that you had to show some good signs of wear to get new "clobber" at Horseferry Road Stores. I copied their example. We arrived at Victoria Station at 2.30pm and marched to Horseferry Road. The Canadians went their way and the Tommies theirs. I found the noise and bustle very confusing for a while. At Horseferry Road AIF Headquarters we received our pay due, and put in our equipment into the store. I retained my haversack and one shoulder strap to carry a towel and shaving things. We then went to the Clothing store to exchange if possible our "battle scarred" clothes for some fresh ones. All fixed up at 6 pm and one day of leave nearly gone. Nesbitt and I went to the War Chest Hostel for tea and to the Union Jack Club afterwards</p>
