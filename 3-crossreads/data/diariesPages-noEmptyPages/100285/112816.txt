finally finished up with a big plate of custard jam tart, they live like lords down there, handy to have a brother in a job like that. We came home about 8 oclock then went down to the Orderly Room, but could not find the list so I took the opportunity to write a letter, after an hour or so a chap came in I asked him what about the Dental list, why they are here he said fished them out from under a water jug, they had been there all the time, luckily it was only a short one so I was soon finished for the night.
27th. Soon finished my job this morning for on Saturdays they don't have so many men to run through. Looks a little clear this morning but I suppose it will rain again
