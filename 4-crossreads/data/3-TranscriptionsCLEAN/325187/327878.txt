 C.O. made me Mess Secretary to start a Regimental mess again as we have been separated so long in Squadrons   Very hot & a man has no comforts on the Desert, the Flies are in myriads   We have an artillery road & a light military railway  Turkish aeroplanes come & have a look at us, but keep their Bombs for shipping & bigger game.  Cuth Fetherstonhough passed in the Trucks today  they  the 12:L.H. are now camped within a mile of us. I see my  Permanent  rank of Captain only went thro' in orders dated April 13th as no vacancy in Brigade occurred before- but I have been a Temporary Captain for 7 months
