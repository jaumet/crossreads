 I Headquarters Desert Mtd Corps 20/4/18 
 My dear Judge, After being a few days over 5 months here in this village, Corps Hdqrs are rumoured to be about to move. We are all looking forward, with feelings far removed from pleasure, to spending a while down towards the Jordan. 
 I have just been looking up  the  what Baedeker has to say of the summer climate 130[&deg;]F has been registered in the South end of the valley but the maximum temperature reached is not definitely known as so far no European has elected to stay there during the hot months and even the inhabitants move up into the hills. Imagine 130[&deg;]F in a place 12 &ndash; 1300 ft below sea level &ndash; the wet bulb reading must be about that in the hottest part of a Turkish bath. 
 I should think we dont know where we're going exactly and I should say we certainly shant be in that region for long. 
 I had a cable from home two days ago saying both my brothers in France have been hit &ndash; the younger one sustaining a compound fracture of the femur and the other flesh wounds of arm &amp; side. It is quite a relief. 
 With a show like the present over there it almost goes without saying
