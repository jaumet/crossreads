<p>the slightest sign of decent weather this afternoon I will be into my work. Lt. Reid is going away for four days and another Lieut. is relieving him, a rather interesting chap, though my hosts tell me he is a great chatterbox. He has promised me some decent souvenirs, but I'm not sure if they're exactly what War Records want. At sundown every night, those 'planes which have been out all day, come in just as the night flyers go out. Those going out fly high but the returning ones come home steeplechasing, just skimming the trees, and generally playing all kinds of aeronautical tricks. The flight commander, with pennant flying, will start to climb - all following in formation - and suddenly he will do a loop. Then it's "follow my leader". As soon as he has done this he will roll to the right. Then to the left; all following suit. Then he'll nose dive till your heart's in your mouth. Then he'll lead them in a climb, like a lot of fishes in an aquarium rising to the surface. When high enough up he heads them in a majestic plane that carries them down to the aerodrome. You can't imagine such buoyancy of spirits. Talk about "tails up"!</p>

<p>A<strike>lan</strike> who goes to Italy on the 24th, sent me some information regarding camouflage that was of very great value. I asked for bread and he gave me a banquet. There isn't anything doing. The weather is close, windy and full of wild showers; but as soon as I've written this I will get out to my painting while there's a bit of sunshine and my luck is in. Our status as painters has so changed from what it promised, that it is impossible to say what is going to become of us. I had been hoping so much to have completed this canvas before now and to have made some other sketches to be worked up later that it seemed that I might be able to ask for a short spell in Blighty to carry them to completion. But the weather and other adverse conditions have worked against this and I couldn't possibly demand it without courting disaster. My time's up - the mailman's due to go. He goes irregularly these restless days.</p>
