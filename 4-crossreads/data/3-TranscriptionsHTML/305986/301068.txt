<p>now have a very fair fire going, it took some to get it going though there were only 8, giving advice and poking at the dashed thing, but she is going good now. They have cut our rations down and I have been hungry for 3 days, Im afraid to sit down to a feed or Ill eat all my days rations at one pop. Am going out foraging this evening to see if I can cadge any from the batteries, there are a lot along the road mostly 6 &amp; 8in real beauties</p>
