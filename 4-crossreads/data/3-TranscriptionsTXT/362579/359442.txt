 to London, My leave is finished Monday night. Now for some news. Am not going back to France. Staying in England   &amp;  to be on Duty at Croydon, not far out of London. Miss Cornwell is Matron, so my luck is in. May not be very long with her because I have asked for transport to Aust. Am on the spot if there is room on a boat but about 100 names are before mine. 
 Maybe shall leave the beginning of next year, so please don't send any more parcels   &amp;  stop any friends from doing likewise. 
 My address will be C/ Officer Commanding Aust. Base P. Office Horseferry Rd. London. 
 Have had a gay time  since our arrival in England.
