<p>27/4/1916  Thursday</p>
<p>Had a swimming parade at 6.15 am. Drilling on the sand all the morning. We had to get up about 5 am &amp; roll out as an airship was located, it turned out to be one of our own, so we were quite disappointed at not having a bit of fun. Had a Kit inspection in the evening, they called in a lot of stuff &amp; only left us with a bare change &ndash; it means we shall not have quite so much to carry. Wrote to Tom O'Hagan.</p>
<p>Can notice the Gun Boats throwing out their search lights all around them all night.</p>

<p>29/4/1916  Saturday</p>
<p>Had two good swims &ndash; Struck tents &amp; cleaned up the Camp &ndash; While having a swim two large boats passed thro the Canal, but women or no women on board, the lads were in stages of dress or undress, most of us swam alongside.</p>
