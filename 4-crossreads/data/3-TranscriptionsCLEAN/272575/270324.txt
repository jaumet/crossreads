  
 Some of the papers sent have reached me, but there are a lot away yet, I do not expect to see them, Dora. C. told me in her letter that She was sending a Mail with account of Anzac day.   we were in the trenches that day, - I have not received any letter from H. yet.   I daresay it will get here, in time, I have some cards to send Bett. Some Cairo views, I did not manage to get very good ones, as the Gyppos. wanted as much as 6d each for decent cards, and I did not consider them worth it.   So far I have not purchased any French views, I dont know whether the Military authorities would allow them to be sent.   I heard when we landed, that, they would not pass the Censor, it may be true and it may not,   All round here, There is not a farm house that has not suffered,  They are nearly all alike, battered to the ground, by Shell fire.   You see first, a patch of fine old trees Cider apple & pear.   Some fine old cherry trees etc.,   Then if you look round in the vicinity you find a heap of battered bricks, once they found a house, of other houses the walls, reman, some of the villages that the huns had to be hunted out of escaped with very little damage nearly all the fighting in those places was done with the bayonet.   There will be plenty more work of that sort done on this side before Fritz is eventually hunted back to his own Territory, and I fancy myself that Willie, will wish That he had stayed home, and let sleeping dogs lie.
