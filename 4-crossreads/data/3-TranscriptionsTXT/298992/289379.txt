but I would not place too much confidence in that, there are such a lot of rumours to about, that it is always best to wait and see. I have not had a chance to see Noel yet, I daresay he is far too busy getting things straightened out for a few days, to look me up. The sea-air seems to like me, because my cold has gone, and I am feeling in the pink, so don't worry about that, and I am going to look after myself more carefully this time too - I want to get there sure this time. This is a lovely large boat though not as roomy as the old "Bee", and the troop decks are very warm and close. I have met several fellows on board I know, old Fort St. lads in the A.M.C. and there are some decent lads in our mess, so I can see us having a real pleasant trip over. This may go ashore at Melbourne, though we do not know if we are calling yet.
Remember me to any enquirers, and with lots of love to you all

Remember to KEEP SMILING I guess I shall pull through this as I generally manage to.
