<p>10th March 1917. Woke at 7 after a great sleep. Went on duty at 8 till 2. The Battalion HQR shifted their station from our dugout today leaving us on our pat. If old Fritz gets a footing here now we are gone to the woods. Anyhow its a good idea for us to be here alone as we can sleep right here. Fixed up sleeping &amp; messing quarters opposite telephone dugout [indecipherable] Avenue. Fritz strafed tonight &amp; made it hot for a while. Went on duty at 12 till 4 and read Aust papers etc which came in by mail. Received letters from Rana &amp; Florrie.</p>
<p>11th march 1917. Got up at 8.30 and had breakfast. Fritz busy shelling this morning. Walked up to Battery at 10.30. Shaved &amp; washed &amp; went into Armentieres for dinner.

Went on duty at 8 till 12. <u> News through at 11.5 that Bagdad has fallen.</u></p>
