<p>Monday 4th<br/>Boisterous day so stopped in bed until about 10.30 a.m. Spent morning in hospital and visited Y.M. during afternoon.</p>
<p>Attended concert in evening when Clarence Wakefield an old comic singer of civilian times provided most attraction &amp; said good bye to Haynes Park as he was leaving for the front. He was given a good send off and was a good comic.</p>
<p>Tuesday 5th<br/>Had a good hot bath and in afternoon was removed to a little hospital at Church End about <strike>3/4</strike> 1 mile from the camp. It is a two storied cottage &amp; old. Three patients share a room which serves as a drawing room &amp; bedroom. A "handywoman" acts as nurse and cooks &amp; cleans. It is very nice &amp; the food much better than camp food.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6th<br/>Up at 8 am for breakfast. Fixed up mail in morning</p>
