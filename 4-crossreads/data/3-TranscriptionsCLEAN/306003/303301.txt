  
 27.3.16 Mon 27th A & B troop arrived back in camp at 8 oclock this morning When crossing the canal on the punt Eric Dowling was knocked overboard & received a ducking but was close to the bank & managed to catch the rope & no damage done 
 A spy reported that 3 parties of 12 natives in each (armed) were to go out last night & Wednesday night (next) to join the Senussi's & that was the reason the troops were sent out last night in the hopes of catching them but had no success last night, about 11.30 this morning Sergt. Nelson rung me up & said he had a message which I would have to take on the Heliograph so Les & I saddled up & went onto the sand hill & received a message saying that two troops are to be sent out nightly till further orders, & that no reference
