(29)At these baths I was only a week and was then sent for from our main dressing station in Armentieres to take the place of the dental orderly who had been evacuated to hospital with bronchitis.Soon December 1916 I was relieved at the baths and then marched with kit up across the Lys by the Pont de Nieppe, across the stretch of level into Armentieres to the billets of the ambulance at the Institute St Jude's (Roman Catholic School). These buildings were practically undamaged by shellfire except for broken windows and formed very clean if cold billets.
The next morning I commensed as dental orderly for Lieut Satchell in the Maternity Home a department of the large H&ocirc;pital Civil. This home formed a very fine main dressing station for our ambulance containing as it did a very fine operating theatre with a ward for patients on either side as well as some smaller rooms. This place was about two and a half miles from the front line which was then very quiet.
