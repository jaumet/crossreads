 Jack Wills &amp; I had to go to Shick Allam to try our lines of communications today, we left early on the bikes &amp; everything went well for the first 15 miles. Shick Allam was reached in due course &amp; as we got there so early, we decided to push on to Beit Khalef the going now for miles was frightful we got 1 puncture &amp; 1  blow out on account of the holes, struck the squadron by chance Jack Wills then got another puncture I pushed on to the hill &amp; set up the helio straight away called &amp; they answered immediately, carried on for about an hour then left for home but I hadn't gone 200 yards when I got another blow out so I rode her on the rim for a mile, fixed her up &amp; then off we set, put another 10 miles behind us [indecipherable] I went whof into another hole &amp; still another blow out, the heat at this time

 [continuation from entry of 26 April] 
 was well on 190&deg; in the sun &amp; the tyres were too hot to hold fixed that up with the last bit of rubber we had left &amp; got under way once more when about 2 miles out of here (Sohag) Jack W pulled up alongside me to tell that his tyre was again flat &amp; in doing so got his bars caught in mine &amp; didn't we come a beaut, nobody hurt &amp; machines undamaged, he had to stop so I sent Watty out with a new tube. I got into camp at 2 oclock burnt to a cinder, the C O couldn't believe that we had been at Khalaf &amp; when he was convinced was quite pleased at our doings. Horses went out as usual to the palms &amp; Signalling class went on as usual. I was posted to take charge of Sig office at Bde H Qs so now am billeted in a brick house. Bed at nine thirty. 
 Mail tomorrow.
