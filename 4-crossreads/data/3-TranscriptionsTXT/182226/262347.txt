 Sunday 21 November, 1915 
 Met a petty officer at breakfast at Hotel De France. He was out at one of the Submarines that had got into the sea of Marmara. 
 We took him to the club &amp; he made us have lunch with him. 
 In the afternoon we went out to Pieta where we stayed till 1.30 a.m. We had no money but we fixed things up at the Hotel De France. We said we would fix up on pay day.
