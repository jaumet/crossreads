  
 One of the firemen on this ship broke his wrist while boxing one of our lads a few days ago, he is now unable to work & the ships Captain is stopping his wages & also making him pay for his passage & even food 
 Some of the boys have taken up a collection on the boat for him, it appears he went into the ring against the Captains wish with the above result  Anyhow it is pretty stiff on a man 
 8th. Been very much cooler today thank heaven & it has been quite a pleasure to be on top, but last night was a corker for we all got properly flooded out & wet to the hide by a tropical storm of some violence the decks were all flooded in a couple of secs & we were nearly swept into the sea, took us pretty well the whole day to dry our blankets & etc.
