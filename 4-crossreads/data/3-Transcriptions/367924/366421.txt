<p>All the Kojonup chaps swaps any news that we hear from around that way. Mr. Finlay has just been telling me about Harry Cook. He has his mail I have not got mine yet. I generally have to wait about three to four days after the rest owing to mine going to the 9th. I was troubled with my throat all the way over on the boat &amp; for about three weeks after landing in Egypt but since then it has been splendid.</p>
<p>There is some real good land where we are now, there is miles &amp; miles of couch grass, they grow nearly all <strike>barly</strike> barley crops in this country, it will be a great place for farming after the War, there is absolutely no clearing to be done at all, as far as I have seen you could go straight a head for weeks with the plow.</p>
<p>I have not heard from Dora yet. I will write if she writes to me, but not other wise. We get our mail fairly regular &amp; one does look forward to getting it. I had a letter from Mrs. Debnam last week, I am in the same section with a chap who carried her son back to the Field Ambulance when he got hit, but he died before he got ashore to the Hospital.</p>
<p>I will be very pleased when the War is over &amp; I can get back to the farm again, to be able to do as I like, everyone here will be pleased to get back home again. Remember me to Birt &amp; Mrs B. also F. Dennis &amp; Tommy Norrish &amp; Family.</p>
<p>Well I think I have told you about all the news for this time, so I will close with sending my best wishes to you &amp; the Boss &amp; remember me to George. Jimmy Fitsmaurice is one of my Sargents he used to work for Ted Holly. Water is not to plentyfull here, you are lucky to get one wash a day. Mr. Finlay wished to be remembered to both of you.</p>
<p>Well I must close with sending you my love. Good Bye for the present.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>I hope Nell will go and stay with you again before to long.</p>
