Sun shining brightly but wind still strong at 0830. Broke ice and washed still bad with this damned dysentery. After breakfast walked down to pier and saw MLO he says a few days should see us off Big gangs at work clearing up road being mended. General Birdwood down there. Submarine still in port, damage must amount to thousands. Large steamer will be refloated probably and jack tars at work on capstan were hauling the "beetle " off.
Trawler which set out with some canteen stores returned after a fruitless rough cruise all up down the Gulf of Saros. Twelve case of one lot were washed off. Returning saw Turkish prisoners under guard working on road drainage, some of them very fair smart looking men, others dirty hangdog swarthy. Take them all through they are a fine stamp of man. Most of them wear small turban round the fez. 
The cold still intense and snow around but later the wind dropped and sun was warm. Aeroplane made up for enforced idleness of last day or two by extra activity and were departing and returning from the peninsular. Very pretty to see them landing and on setting out to watch their gradual mounting. After lunch went to Ordnance and bought cap for 1/6 and puttees for 1/10 very reasonable Went up to GHQ to pay this huge amount
