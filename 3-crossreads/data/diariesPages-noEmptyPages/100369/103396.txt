"My Creed"
Because I hav?nt a creed in the world
As creeds in the creed books go
There are those who hold me condemned by God
As I am by them below.
2
But I feel, if I read the story right
Of the Man of Bethlehem,
I would rather trust my soul to His Love
Than sit and be judged by them
3
For creeds at best are man made things
And man is mortal and vain
And apt, if a sinner he sits to judge
To break his own creeds in twain.
4
But the Lord looks straight in the hearts of men
And He judges our lives aright
And He does?nt care for the creed you bare
But the motives you have in sight
5
For a thousand creeds which preach of Christ
Are full of their own conceits
And the line of demarcation is wide
Where God and the creed book meets
6
I hav?nt a creed that a Church would own
But I reckon the Lord of Love
Will open the Gate, if a chap lives straight
And find him a place above.
