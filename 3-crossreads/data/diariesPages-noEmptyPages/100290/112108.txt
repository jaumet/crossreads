Wednesday
For a wonder no casualties brought down after last night. one man killed. We are to be relieved today. Relief comes in afternoon. Fritz gives us a few parting shells as a farewell. Back to Longueval without incident. Mud more mud. Shiver groan all night with the cold.
Mary's Xmas parcel arrives what a mine of wealth it contained. Sweets dainties of all sorts. How welcome they are.
