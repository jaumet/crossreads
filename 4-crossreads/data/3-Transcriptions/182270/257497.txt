<p>Fine &amp; warm. Tickle took the wagon</p>
<p>down to Boundary with netting &amp;</p>
<p>salt. Got some logs in Boundary</p>
<p>scrub &amp; took them to Walhallow</p>
<p>for cutting. I brought 198 sheep</p>
<p>out of Wheelers &amp; put them in</p>
<p>Woolshed. Were going to Merilong</p>
<p>for the night then over to kangaroo</p>
<p>shoot at Glen Moan but it</p>
<p>was put off at last minute.</p>
