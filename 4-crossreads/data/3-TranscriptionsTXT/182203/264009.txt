 poor old hip? It is not quite so hot to-day so hope to get cooler now. Sister Dickenson (Mrs Barrie's friend) called to see me the other day. She belongs to 3rd Australian General Hospital, 15 of them leave here any time now for Lemnos Hosp., near Dardenelles. She is a very pretty girl  &amp; seems a very nice quiet girl. I shall see her again before she leaves. Tell Mrs Barrie she sends her love &amp; I have seen her. I shall write to her next week. My hand gets tired, have to arrange my writing book a certain way. Hope you are all well &amp; happy. All my nurse friends are very good to me &amp; come to see me as often as they can. Matron Cornwall called to see me last night &amp; said she wished I was well enough to come back to her but I beleive I'm to stay here. One never knows though. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all.  From your loving daughter                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Edith.
