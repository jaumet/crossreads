 Friday 17th December Our Steamer went up close to the Headquarters Steamer & received instructions & soon two Barges were alongside - one to take the men from other units off & the other for our Baggage & Party. It did not take very long to get the lot of stuff on her & off we went to the shore & were dumped onto a wharf. There were other Units besides those over which I had charge (the 3rd F.A. Brigade Headquarters 8th - 9th Batteries & Am Column). Every ones baggage got mixed up
