<p>32 Stationary Hospital.<br/>near Wimereux. B.E.F. France.<br/>11 June. 1917.</p>
<p>Mrs J. Ellis.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>You will already have heard the sad news that your Son, Private A. R. Ellis of the 33 Canadian Regt passed away in this Hospital on the 7 June. I had previously told you in my last letter that he was very dangerously ill.</p>
<p>If he left any Effects or Belongings in this Hospital, you will receive them in due course, but I fear that it will be some considerable time ere you do so, as these things have to go through the Proper Channels &amp; there are very very many to be dealt with.</p>
<p>I am sending you herein a Photograph of the Wimereux Cemetery, where your Son is laid to Rest, as I am sure you would like to have it. On the Back I have marked the Number of your Sons Grave. Each Cross bears a Number, and also the Name &amp; the Regiment of the Soldier.</p>
<p>In offering you my very deep and heartfelt sympathy in your very great trouble, May I be permitted at the same time to say, that although it is as yet far too early, the time will come when it will be some consolation to you to remember that your Son gave up his Life willingly &amp; nobly for his Country, doing his Duty. He has given his All, and is now at Rest, and it is for those whom he has left behind, that our Thoughts and our Prayers are for. May God grant you comfort and strength to bear your loss</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>E. B. B. Towse. Captain<br/>The Gordon Highlanders</p>
