  April  May 1917 5th   The weather has been very sultry to-day &amp; this afternoon we had a thunder storm with heavy rain, the first I have seen of its kind for a long while.  The school is starting on Monday &amp; we are to change our quarters to make room for the men coming in to it. 6th   This morning we packed up &amp; moved to a new billet about &frac12; a Kilometre away where we aught to be comfortable. As usual we had the afternoon off &amp; with a couple of others I rode into ? a village about 6 Kms. away. The scenery is very beautiful around here &amp; is thouroghly apprecated after what we have had of late.
