 Still on outpost. Small scraps occur every day t'wixt Turks& our PATROL & the railway crawls along towards us. I enclose cutting from bulletin. Trooper K is our cook Old Keppie, a splendid chap & a Bushie. I did not know he had literary talent. I don't know what the C.O. thinks about his last statement. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  If old Sam comes thro' D'quin he might be able to get me leave to come home but I'm doubtful. I see the old man went to America. 
 Jim Ayre has collected a lot of seeds & I'm enclosing some - hope no noxious weeds among 'em. Just wild flowers from the Holy Land.
