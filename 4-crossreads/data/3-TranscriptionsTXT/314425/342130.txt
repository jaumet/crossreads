About midnight numerous planes dropped a large number of bombs in the vicinity of this camp, but chiefly along the river. This morning his batteries shelled gun positions for several hours. This afternoon the enemies aeroplanes brought down 4 of our observation baloons in flames &amp; escaped despite anti aircraft fire apparently unharmed.
