  
 ............corner to meet the mail I meet 3 ladies going for a ...............to Bucks Mills.  I receive an impromptu invitation ......the day with them.  It was such a nice day too ............on the beach.  The next day I go on to Lynton .........and see the magnificient Scenery around ................  The waters meet in Lyn Valley - the Valley of rocks & .....rock.  Now glancing up I see I have come to the 14th page & must think of signing my name to all this.  And is it all worth the reading?  Do tell me my friends if I bore you.  It's my chief delight to write to you, & I have lots to tell you yet, Time lately has been so precious - we have been ever so busy here. During our busiest time too the Influenza swept over us which involved extra work on those who kept well.  When the worst was over - help came - but I shall always think that they were sent  too late  & at the price of death - for Sister Sakinton - one of our dear comrades who was with us in Lemnoss & who felt she couldn't give in - one might say died at the post - for she was on duty the day previous & died the next day at Southwell Gardens of Pneumonia.  It was a sad shock to us all.  The was buried in our peaceful corner with our own [indecipherable] boys. 
 I did not finish telling of my holiday then & the last two days was the best that crowned all the others for they were lived & loved with those dear friends who have been so good to me - The Robjohns at Bexhill, Mrs Robjohns is the dearest old lady it has been my priviledge to know - And her two daughter-in-law are just as charming as their lovely Mother - and equally as good are they to some of our Australian boys. 
 Good-bye dears.  I must stop now with ever so much love 
 Sincerely Yours Anne Donnell 8.7.1918 
 PS:  From all accounts the Sammys and Aussies like each other well.  I thought they would.
