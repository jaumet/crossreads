There is a veri warm time ahead for Fritz . I suppos we will get it pretti hot ourselv but Fritz will , get , all he deserv , or I hope he will , last mail in I had letter from Min one from Dora , - a few day ago I receiv a card from Cousin D. at Narrandera just befor we came here I receiv your letter and Bett . The parcel has not arriv yet , it may come along at ani time , About three week ago I had a short note from T. Kennett . B.N. to tell me that they have had good rain in the N. West and there is plenti of feed again , if some of this French weather could be sent across Aus . would be absolut the finest countri under the sun , This is mid summer here , and the hottest day so far has not been wors than a nice sunni day in Spring in N.S.W. I dont think that we will get ani hot weather now , and when the winter come round , well , I dont know what we will do , for I guess that this place is go to be cold , and then our feet will be colder than " Frog on Ice" , ? " That 's not a french dish " ? just a metaphor , or ani name you like to call it .
