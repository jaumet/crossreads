 Every tent has a Chameleon these days, they take me back to a School Break Up many years ago & the "PIECE" I had to recite- Here, one Tommy says they even turn the color of the  net  meshes in the Mosquitoe Netts. A Chameleon lives on Flies so is never hungry here & is valued at 6 packets of Cigarettes. I had one in my Tent in No 2 General Hospital Pretoria.
