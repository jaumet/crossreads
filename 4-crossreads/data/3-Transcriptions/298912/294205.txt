<p>communications from trench to trench that is permanent lines of communication, maintaining them &amp; carrying on more of the press messages &amp; long distance work, or all the busy work. Well, we were taken on at Moore Park for rations &amp; equipment, but not training as there was no means of instructing up. There were no flags &amp; no buzzers to even practice with beyond private instruments.  Our work also includes helio work. A helio is principally a mirror on a tripod with such arrangements as to allow the mirror to be flashed on the desired object or distant station. It has the advantage of very long distance working as far as up to seventy miles but at short distances under five miles is unsuitable owing to the brilliant flash that "cuts" ones eyes. Its other main disadvantages are that it requires careful attention, a single knock throwing it out of alignment with the other station. Also that it can only be used when the sun is shining &amp;when cloudy it is of no use</p>
