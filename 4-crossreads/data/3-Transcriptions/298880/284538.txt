<p>We marched through the town about 12.30 AM to just outside <strike>we</strike> the town we had to march up a hill about a &frac12; mile in length.

<p>Myself and three others from the section walked into Ailly about 5 miles from Bellancourt and got four bikes and rode back to the Bn. We were caught in a very heavy and cold storm blowing from the north but did not get very wet as we had our waterproof cycle capes on.</p>
