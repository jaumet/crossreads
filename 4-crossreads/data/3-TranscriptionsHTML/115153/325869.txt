<p>was behind a wall of sandbags of which the Lieutenants were just too late in reaching and getting to safety.<br/>We shifted back from this trench to a reserve trench where we had a little less shelling, but it was bad enough to be uncomfortable, even after coming out of a veritable "Hell on earth". We stayed in this trench a few days until the remnants of our battalion drifted back to us, as they were in all other battalions owing to our disorganisation at the beginning of the battle.<br/>While we were in reserves the Scotch came up and made a charge at Bullecourt and we were in readiness in case we were wanted to back them up. Looking through the darkness from our position in reserves, we saw great gun flashes and heard the noise of the bombardment increasing, then wild yelling and machine gun fire, and we knew the Scotties were going "over the top".<br/>They made a success of the business which the Tommies failed to do when working in co-operation with us (Australians). When daybreak came dozens of wounded Scotties passed through our reserve trench which was really a road to the dressing station, and it was grand to see the "Aussies" giving the Scotties the only water they had from their (The Australians) water bottles. Some of the Scotties fainted with exhaustion and our battalion doctor worked hard in attending to them.<br/>After Bullecourt was secure in our side's hands, we moved back through Norieul, then through Vaulx on to Bapaume, then on to Le Sars which was a distance in all from Bullecourt of 15 miles. <br/>Next morning we went on another long march which brought us, via Albert, to Mametz Wood Camp where we stayed a few days and went onto Mellincourt. While at Mellincourt I visited Amiens again and had a very enjoyable time. I also visited Henencourt and several other neighbouring villages which were very interesting. <br/>During this time since the Battle of Bullecourt, I felt very nervy, but the relief of being away from the sound of guns kept me going until I was stricken with Trench Fever, when the shell-shock overtook my nerves. I retired to my bunk feeling as though I had influenza, and next morning I could not rise from my bed, and consequently the doctor examined me and had me sent off in an ambulance to C.C.S. (Casualty Clearing Station). I was at C.C.S.</p>
