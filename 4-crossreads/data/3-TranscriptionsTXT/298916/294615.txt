Word was thereupon sent to the forts to send the examination steamer to their assistance. At the same time the searchlights found them & as a coincidence, the pass signal up the harbour for that night was a red light. After a lot of trouble & by the assistance of the searchlights they were towed to safety, & spent the night on the pilot boat. At 1pm 9th October the Second Officer & Teddy were sent back to the A13. Teddy's only concern was the loss of his cap & being cold.

13th October During the morning the Coolies were discovered to have chicken pox in their quarters. By arrangement with the Health authorities the Coolie quarters were disinfected, it not being necessary to quarantine. The Coolie quarters are situated as far off as possible, over the vessel's screw. They are small & have no cabins, but the bunks are arranged like shelves. The Coolies smoke here until it is stifling. Dirt they love.
