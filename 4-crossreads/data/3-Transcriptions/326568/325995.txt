<p>January 18th.  To-day we were told that all the A.I.F. would be out of France in five months, but as to our 1915 men, uncertainty exists.  Snowing a little to-day. <br/>January 27th.  Doing nothing but loaf.  Last night it snowed heavily and the ground is "tout blanc"  We made a decent walk through the woods which are very pretty just now.<br/>January 28th.  Am going on leave to Paris soon.  Have another walk through the snow covered woods.<br/>January 29th.  Awaiting patiently my leave pass for Paris<br/>January 31st.  Heavy snow last night &amp; there is 6" over everything to-day &amp; the villages are fairy like in appearance.</p>
