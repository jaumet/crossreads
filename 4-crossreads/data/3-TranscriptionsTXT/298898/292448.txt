it was worth it.
Saturday 3rd Feb. & Sunday 4thNothing of note to recount. Usual cold prevails with no sign of a thaw. Duties same as days preceding. Guns still very active some specially large ones making themselves felt.
Monday 5th Feb.Nothing of importance doing. Great rumours about concerning American attitude over Germanys U-Boat manifesto. I annoy quite a number by refusing to believe that America has already declared war & that Austria has asked for a separate peace etc. Personally I save myself a great deal of worry by refusing to believe or even think about anything until it is official & don't they flare up when I start putting such questions as Who told you? Did you see it yourself etc. Tis taken as a personal slight.
