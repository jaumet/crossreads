railway embankment early this morning & "Fritz" has been keeping up a determined fire of "fire-mines" all day & night.
Sat. 5th. May-"Fritz" counter-attacked this morning & we moved up to line but he was shoved back again on the right & our fellows made an advance of 200 yds while the time was ripe.Of course there were plenty of casualties on account of the artillery fire but I really have never seen so many "walking cases".Went into front line again this afternoon relieving 1st Bn. on left of road.Communication saps in an awful state with old dead.Just missed getting blown up in a dugout by a direct hit; lost all equipment bar telephone. I am really pleased I diddid take a stroll after some breakfast.
Mon. May. 7th: -Relieved tonight by 5th Bn. & went to sunken road outside of Noreuil & this is the finish of our "gift" stunt in front of Reincourt. The BN. had about 250 Casualties but only about 50 killed.S.Bearer Moss, Corp. Anderson. Bob Rutherford, Heuston, Murdoch & Butler were killed.Kendrigan, Bob O'Keefe & McMillan wounded.Signallers Joe Wakeley, Tom Bladen & Mulholland killed. Burton & Campey  wounded.
