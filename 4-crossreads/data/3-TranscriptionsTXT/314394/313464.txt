25th March We passed a place called ORANGE a town about the same size as ORANGE in N.S.Wales, we remained here 3/4 of an hour and obtained something to eat. This was our first experience of the French way of serving up meals. This first days journey was very interesting to all and every one was struck by the beautiful scenery and the French girls with their high colour and good features. The strong smell of flowers also attracted much attention. The electric trains were a novelty to the Australians. German prisoners were working in different places in route; the men did not show any signs of hatred to them outwardly.The bright green vegetation called forth much comment, some remarked this is a country worth fighting for". At every place we passed the French people turned out to welcome us, their manner showed every good feeling and the Australians much appreciated this and showed their appreciation by cheering all the time. The train as is usual with troop trains was very slow.
26th Passed through VERSEILLES, MARSEILLES,LYONS and within sight of PARIS. The boys turned out and asked for souvenirs from the Australians who freely gave them anything they had.
27th Major Ross, Captain SINGLE, Lieut BYRNE and myself travelled down in one ordinary carriage and during the trip I had a heated argument with the Chaplain.
28th Saw the palace of VERSEILLES in the distance and also PARIS in the distance. Arrived at the end of our journey and marched to our billets at STEENWORK.
29th Went to BERTHEN Trench Mortar School and about nine miles away, travelled in motor buses and had a very interesting trip. Passed some of our own transport and as we were the first to arrive in FRANCE much enthusiasm was shown by both the transport men and ourselves. We were soon observed by the hats we were wearing. The troops passed on the way cheered and we all enjoyed the trip.
30th Had mess with some English Artillery Officers at BERTHEN. Attended the school and found it very interesting. Weather cold. The firing can be heard from here and enemy TAUBES fly over at times.
31st All the 5th Bde officers think that the Trench Mortars are no good and so interest is not very keen. BERTHEN has a rather nice church and it always appears in use. Our mess is in the parson's house
