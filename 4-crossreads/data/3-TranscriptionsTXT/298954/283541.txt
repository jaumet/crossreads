 1917 Our table did well since old Martin was an expert fisherman. 
 The burial of a Japanese who had died from beri-beri gave the fastidious qualms about eating the fish which we caught here at the Carcados. 
 Tue. 6th Nov. The loot which the Huns want has been brought over:   all aboard the "Hitachi" came over to "Wolf" today. 
 Wed. 7th Nov. The two vessels put to sea today at 8.30 a. (the "Eastern squadron of the Imperial German Navy" as a wag put it).   The "Eastern squadron" steamed out through the shoals and at 1.30 pm hove to in the open sea. 
 "Hitachi" flew the German Ensign.   A bomb exploded on each side of her forward well-deck at 1.45 and she slowly commenced to settle by the head on an even keel. 
 At 2.12 pm. her stern rose high into the air as she dived;  her propellers flashed for a moment and she had gone.   Wreckage kept shooting to the surface for some time;   many deck houses, booms, etc floated.
