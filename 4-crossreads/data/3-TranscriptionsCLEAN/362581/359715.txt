  
 Sept 7th 1916 London 
 My darling Eddy, I have sent you a book about the Tower of London. Mother   &  Auntie will be able to read some of it to you. When you are a man   &  travel it will be of greater interest to you to know the History of England. I'm very sorry that I remember so little. the Castles are wonderful old place   &  most of them in beautiful positions. I have bought a book on Windsor Castle shall send it to you when I've read it. Heaps of love   &  kisses From your loving Auntie Edith
