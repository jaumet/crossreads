<p>August 1915<br/>at Suvla Bay</p>
<p>Saturday 7th<br/>The bombardment still continues at 10.30 it was one continuous roar.  Achi Baba was the principle object &amp; the peninsular looked as if it was in a dust storm.  In the afternoon we rowed out to the transport Tringa &amp; got some stores.  The RNA Service were on board &amp; they treated us well, gave us tobacco etc.  The night was fairly cool.  A destroyer brought in a load of Turkish prisoners about 500</p>
<p>Sunday 8th<br/>There was no service this morning.  The minister was too busy with the casualties of which there are many.  There was more severe fighting at Anzac at night &amp; more men were landed at Suvla Bay, the 53rd Division I believe.  Considerable progress has been made.</p>
<p>Monday 9th<br/>Heavy gun fire continues at Anzac &amp; to a less extent at Achi Baba</p>
