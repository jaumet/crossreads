All watches were advanced one hour at 11 pm last night for summer time. During afternoon Padre went over burying any bodies lying about and discovered scores of our own German Turned them in and said a prayer.

G. O. Greig up to the front line for tonight's stunt to get in touch once more with present day methods! Late afternoon was beautiful, cloudless sky and bright (but feeble) sun. After tea batman brought in large white hot brazier which made the tent like a furnace and cannot be good for one. In preparation for early morning move made arrangements for all superfluous contents of the tents such as papers, tins etc to be dumped at the incinerators and also for a party of men to stay behind and clean up after the companies move out. Turned in at 10 pm only removing tunic boots and slept warm but awoke crumby messy
