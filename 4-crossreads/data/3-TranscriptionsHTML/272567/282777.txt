<p>19/11/18 Yzeux<br/>Rode over to St Vast and spent the morning there. Then rode on to Flessells and had a caf&eacute; with Georgette and her aunt. The kid cried horribly when I left poor little 17 year old. These French are so demonstrative. As her aunt says it is something to say that at least someone weeps for you! A very prettily situated village this but now all the leaves are off the trees. What a life to live here &ndash; always doing nothing. A long ride home in the dark. The entertainment takes place on 22nd at Vignacourt. Had a long argument with Georgette's uncle about Clemenceau. Foch &amp; Co.Every Frenchman finds a reason for our victories in the unity of Command. McColl BM. &amp; Colonel James are back from English leave today. Much milder in temperature today.</p>
