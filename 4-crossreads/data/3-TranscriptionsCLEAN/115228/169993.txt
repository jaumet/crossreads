  Oct 24th :  The Brigade moved out at 4.39 p.m. & travelled to Abassiniel(?) - Kebir (about 7 miles) where we arrived in camp at 8.30 p.m.  We expect a big offensive operation to commence by us in a few days time.  Two enemy aeroplanes were recently brought down by our new fighting machines.  We have something like 250,000 men now on this
