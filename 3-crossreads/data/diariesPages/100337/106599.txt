the days are bitterly cold.

On the morning of the 9th we had more Rain & Snow accompanied with very heavy hail & wind. At 10 o`clock pm we received orders to move into the front line & were on our way half an hour later, All that night we had no sleep. We were supposed to attack a strongly held German position at the village of Reincourt on the right flank. The attack was to be just at the break of day but owing to the tanks that were to accompany us failing to put in an appearance & owing to the artillary not supporting us, the attack was abandoned, we were given orders to retire back to the supports just as day was breaking. During the retirement the snow fell very thick which effectively screened us from the enemy & enabled us all to get back with very light casualties. It is my opinion that if the snow had not been falling we would almost all have been wiped out, as it happened there were very few killed.

From the support line we then retired back to out starting point – vis, the village of Flaville, about 10 kilometres heavy marching.
