  
 Here we found difficulty in getting transport & on the advice of Major Stodart we proceeded to Romani leaving Magdhaba for the  present  time being while arrangements for camel transport & escort were being made.  At Romani we were the guests of the Camp Commandant who in addition to extending his hospitality, arranged  for the  for camels & attendants & we visited the battle grounds of Romani.  Here two paintings were made & the ground studied.  A water colour sketch of "Kattib Gannit", a sand hill & hod  was also made  near Romani, was also made.  Returning to El Arish we found that everything necessary for our journey had been arranged by the English Officers stationed there & the Governor of El Arish.  We proceeded on Camels to Magdhaba along the bed of the Wady El Arish a distance of some 20 odd miles arriving at sundown.  The day following I completed a canvas of 24" x 20" of the most picturesque view of Magdhaba & the day following made two water colour sketches.
