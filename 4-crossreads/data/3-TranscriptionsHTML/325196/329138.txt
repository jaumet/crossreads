<p>11-3-16<br/>It is rumoured here that 60,000 Australian Infantry troops are going to France &amp; some of them are on their way now; Leask told me that Maj.Mills had recommended him very strongly to Col.Cox for a commission as a Signalling Officer before Leask heard applications were called for , so both he &amp; Traill should have a good chance of getting one as Col Meredith recommended Traill. Our Sigs are at every station where there is a telephone switch board so as we can do business on the same line as the Egyptians &amp; it is very amusing at times to hear the Aus &amp; Egyptians trying to make each other understand <strike>each other</strike></p>
<p>Some Egyptians started a canteen going here for the Queenslanders &amp; can buy chocolate, porridge, cigarettes, tobacco &amp; beer, also tinned fruit, but as we have received no pay since leaving Wardon we cannot afford to buy too much</p>
