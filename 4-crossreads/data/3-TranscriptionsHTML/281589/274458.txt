We marched out at 6.30 PM to go up the line for the Stunt, carried blankets  &amp; stretchers right up to the front line (about 1 miles in front of Novieul) arrived there safely. I went to sleep for a while, Fritz must have taken a tumble, he put a barrage over with gas shells and H.E.s he nearly got me with his gas as I was asleep. He kept it up for about &frac12; hour &amp; about &frac12; hour after that (4 AM) we opened up. the fighting was terrible, we wasn't too successful &amp; suffered heavily.
