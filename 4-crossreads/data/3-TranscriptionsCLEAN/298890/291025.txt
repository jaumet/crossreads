  
 29 Thursday Dullish day but fine.  Pottered in morning.  In afternoon met Dr. B. Dick & Sheilah & a Mr. C. at Navy Stores for tea.  Called at Wilton for Feathers [indecipherable] & home.  No joy in life.  Just dull stagnation of soul & body. 
 30 Friday Went to Minerva & worked in kitchen home at six.  Very cold & comfortless in the house. 
 31 Saturday Dull cold day.  Wrote in morning.  In afternoon, Miss Harding, A.A. & I went to Earl's Court to call on Mrs. Thompson-Price.  Home & wrote some just perishing so did not feel well after it  Oh for warmth & comfort again.
