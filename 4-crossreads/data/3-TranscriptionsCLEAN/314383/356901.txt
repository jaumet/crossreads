 July 5th Very quiet here, tho tonight Diddler came in & told us that the Kurds attacked his village this morning & he gave them a go with his two Sgts. & 13 [Indecipherable]..  The Kurds retired & Diddle chased them for about 20 miles & then returned to write his report to find that tho he chased the main body of Kurds another group came round the back & carried off all the stock.  He had one man killed & is only sure of killing one Kurdish horse.
