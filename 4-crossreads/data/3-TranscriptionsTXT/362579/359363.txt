 To see some of our friends about shortly &ndash; How I wish this cruel war was ended. It will be dreadful up here in the winter for the soldiers. 
 Fancy    in the four years   in the forth year of war. I did not think I would be so long away from home. So pleased to hear about the Dividend. Let me know how much money in the Bank. I should think  that would be a nice little sum for a holiday. Have plenty to go on with   &amp;  shall certainly spend all I want to but still the poor boys as privates cannot get money  so are glad to get a few cigs. 
 Fondest love   &amp;  kisses Edith
