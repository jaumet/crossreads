There are such pretty flowers growing in the fields here. - Cornflowers red Poppies, Daisies and a lot of yellow ones and some Heliotrope coloured ones of which I don't know the name.We don't often see donkeys over here but I have seen a few. - The other day there were fourteen observation balloons up in the air at the same time. - Officers go up in them and have telescopes to see what the Germans are are doing. I hope your dear mother is well again & that you and Tingsie & Peter are three dear little Comforts to her and Daddy. - With very much love to you all.Your loving Uncle,Fred.S.Phillips
