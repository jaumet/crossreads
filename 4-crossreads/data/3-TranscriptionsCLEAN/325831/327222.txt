 France 25.1.17 
 My dear Judge 
 Am back with the Bn again & in the best of condition. It is very cold but am at present quite comfortable in a shelter hut. Shall write you again at first chance. Have got no more note paper handy at present. Saw Keith a few days ago. He was with Gen Holmes. May have a chance to look him up tomorrow & think I know where he is. 
 Best love 
 Yours affectionately 
 C.R. Lucas. 
 P.S. 
 Am at present commanding the Battalion but only for a short time no promotion. 
 C.R.L.
