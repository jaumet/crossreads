this intention during the morning.
Afternoon I had an interesting fly up to Jaffa and then back to Beersheba. Ten other machines took part in the flight and I secured a number of pictures of the formation.
I intend securing my cinema to the machine and taking film there from. With this object I made experiments to ascertain the points of minimum vibration, and have decided to clamp the machine across the gun cockpit, insulating it by means of flat rubber sponges under compression. Capt Addison gave me a display of evolutions in the air, Looping, diving and flying upside down, with just as much ease as a fish in water. The squadron fly Bristol fighters and Martinsydes.
