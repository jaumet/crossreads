<p>webbing equipment issued. All the old kit has been handed in. I was lucky enough to get a new set.</p>
<p>24th May (Wednesday)<br/>Printing photos most of the day, otherwise nothing doing. Aeroplanes still moving about all day. These machines are the ones that have been annoying the Turks lately.</p>
<p>25th May (Thursday)<br/>Exercise in use of Gas helmets. These helmets are just bags made of woollen material soaked in chemicals, with glasses for the eyes and a rubber tube &amp; mouthpiece</p>
