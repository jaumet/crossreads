  
 28.3.15 Sun. 28th.  Very windy & dusty this morning.  Church parade as usual, but the Y.M.C.A. was cloudy with dust & we had only a short service.  A lance Corporal from A Squadron died yesterday at the Heliopolis hospital from pneumonia & was buried this afternoon.  Received a pass out from dinner-time, but did not go to Cairo until after tea.  Cork, Francis & I went to York House, for a sing-song, & returned to Heliopolis early to find there was a letter from Billy Simon & one from Edie Tomlins.
