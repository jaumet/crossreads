 Thu. 9th May Ascension Thursday.   Go to church in the village with the Colonel and Captns Mingo and Lucas.   A splendid morning.   The limes are in full bloom and "Unter den Linden" (the road approaching the village) is now a leafy arcade. 
 The church is of mellow yellowed brick, spired, and stands in the centre of a large cobbled Marktplatz.   Service like High Anglican - a good choir and organ.
