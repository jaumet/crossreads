playing billiards we went to the Empire Club once more & had tea & out on to the breakwater again, met the old gentleman fishing again & came back to town with him, & had a drink of coffee, arrived at the Continental at 7 oclock met Morgan & his friends & put in till 9.30 walking about the town seeing where the bombs were dropped during the air raid on Port Said & eating fruit which is very cheap at the markets; at 9.30 Mills & Morgans friends decided to see the late picture show as a new programme was on & Morgan & I had a cup of coffee & then went back to barracks where he is stationed. Morgan then came back to the Continental with me; Morgan looks better than I have ever seen him looking & is trying to get in a L.H. Regt.
