  
 [Wednesday 6 September 1916] 
 Arrived Southampton early morning & entrained for London now at No 4 General London Hos Kings College Denmark Hill- Several Australians here.  England is green & happy, apparently.  Have called Laura  re my arrival & address.  Everything very up to date grim & unsentimental here,  I often think in Touring Hospitals that the tidyness of the ward is of more importance than the comfort of the patient
