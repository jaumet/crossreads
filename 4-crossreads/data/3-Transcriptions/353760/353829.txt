<p>123.<br/>Writing tonight.<br/>J.D.H. K.I.A. Oct. 1917<br/>Grey clouds roll on a great grey sky<br/>And the mist from the ground's breast high<br/>And a sad song'd breeze<br/>Blows by bare torn trees,<br/>And the ghosts of the dead pass by.</p>

<p>I lay by his side in the white flare's light<br/>And his hands were cold, and his face was white,<br/>And the beauty of all things woke in me,<br/>As I lay in the rich dead company.<br/>As I lay by his side in the night.</p>
<p>And the tier'd guns beat the whole night long<br/>Over the hills their poor tired song.</p>
