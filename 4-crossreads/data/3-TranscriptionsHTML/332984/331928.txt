<p>shells on a road.  A bit of a scatter amongst the wagons; Only lasted a few minutes</p>
<p>12.8.1916   Saturday   Gunners called out at 3.A.M, to proceed to gun position, and dig gun pits.  Our wagon line 6 miles behind gun position, in the Long Valley.  Recieved orders to send to Bty 1,000 rounds of ammunition as soon as possible.  Near our lines is a baloon, observing for a heavy Bty.  This evening I was watching them change shifts.  I was told that the officer who was just going up, got 15 hits on one Bty.  He was going up 2.300 feet.  The weather is hot, and the roads dusty.  A horse that was lost when we first come to this front was found today; In fact it come back itself.  The nights are terrebly foggy, very heavy dew.</p>
