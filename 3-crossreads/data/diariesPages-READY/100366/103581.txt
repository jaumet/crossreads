 
The 50th Batt came back today & the whole Brigade are going up to the trenches again.

Three of us had rather a merry time last night to commerate the finish of our hard job in erecting our bivouac, We started off and walked towards Ballieul keeping this side of the frontier as it means arrest for us to cross to the other side. We eventually came to a place called "Canada Corner" after the Canadians who before they relieved us on the Somme, have been camped there for 14 months, The place is now full of middle aged Englishmen who relieved the Canadians pending our arrival & have since stayed there (RE Engineers) An Australian was a curiosity to them & they would drag us into an Estaminet & treat us. After getting away from there we went further along the road & then decided to take a short cut home. We were all jolly & very often found ourselves in private Yards. However we took a course for the road which we had to strike & got into a private yard & could not get out. The dogs were all barking at us & the people jibbering. While I kept them engaged my 2 mates raided the clothes line & then ran. I caught them up after a while & saw that they each had a bundle of washing on arrival in camp we got a light to see the stolen goods & judge our disgust
