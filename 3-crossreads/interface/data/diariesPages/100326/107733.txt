31/8/15 Had a look at the chart and a blow on the pitchdark boat deck. Yarning to doctor till 10 and then turned in. The whole ship in darkness no lights anywhere
1/9/15 Up at 6. on boat deck very fresh and cool. Sea at its best and delightful after three months in the desert. Some seagulls on the port bow ? land probably not far off. The route we are on is that ploughed by the earliest sailors in the world the Phoenician galley. Probably the transports, the dark ribbed ships of the Iliad en route for Troy were past here. We shall pass through the Archipelago soon all the islands between Greece Turkey towards Lemnos the base of our A.I.F. the island whence Homer's galley returned "freighted with wine". Two officers on lookout for submarines all the time.
