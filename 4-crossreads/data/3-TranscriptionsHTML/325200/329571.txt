<p>the number reported there yesterday   <strike>camp</strike>  came over  &amp;  dropped two bombs to help matters along. The camp was rushed  &amp;  found to contain in all five Bedouins, two killed, two wounded,  &amp;  one intact whom they immediately took prisoner. He was a man of exceptional physique for a native  &amp;  when we saw him trotting behind his guard, he was clad in a rough cloak  &amp;  hood of goats hair which came just down to his hips.<br/>As things turned out this stunt was pure murder. We reached here again at about 8 oclock on Sunday night.</p>
