<p>Juillet 29<br/>Very little doing today. Had Coy Parade in morning. Very heavy showers. Contay appears to be a very old village formed mostly of farm houses along the road &ndash; the usual large barns facing the Rd. &amp; the houses behind. A good many Estaminets thrown in completes the Village.</p>
<p>Juillet 30<br/>Coy left Contay at 2.30 &amp; marched to Puchevillers arriving there about 5 p.m. Entrenched at about 7.45.<br/>The march although not a long one was rather trying, the hard [indecipherable] roads being very hard on the feet.</p>
