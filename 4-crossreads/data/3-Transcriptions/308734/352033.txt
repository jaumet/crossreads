<p>Gallery and saw the paintings, (didn't think much of them).  we then went to the top of Sir Walter Scotts monument.  it has 288 steps from the ground to the platform at the top, the stairway is spiral and at the top very narrow, just room to squeeze through, from the top, a very fine view is to be seen.  The height of the monument is 200 ft and cost &pound;15,560 and took 4 years to build.  We then went up Advocates' Close to St Giles's Cathedral, arrived just in time to be shown over and have it explained by Countess Elgin.  It is very beautiful inside and has some very fine memorials inside and some very ancient banners hanging from the ceiling, saw the place where Jenny Geddes threw the stool at the preachers head.  also saw the statues of the monarchs.  Just outside the door to the right is the heart of Midlothan on the footpath.  we next went into Parliament square and saw the place where John Knox is buried I.K.1572.  near the grave is a statue of Charles 2nd, made of lead in Rotterdam, 1685.  Then into Parliament House, dates from 1632.  the inside hall is 122 ft long and 49 ft wide with a fine oak roof and floor.</p>
<p>In the centre of the roadway is the City Cross which was destroyed in 1652 by Cromwells soldiers and restored in 1885.  We then went over the North Bridge, opened in 1897.  the old one being pulled down as it was too small.  then over to Calton Hill and now the jail, the National monument (Scotlands poverty) 355 ft above sea level.  Nearby is Nelson's monument and the old and new Observatory.  We then went into the Calton burrying ground, in which is some very old and fine tombstones.</p>
