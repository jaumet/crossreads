  
 III Many thanks Father for the statement of funds - The only thing I want to be sure of is that you both have plenty to make you comfortable & I hope that you will not hesitate to draw on me should the necessity arise - By the way the 50 cabled me arrived safely & is in my credit with the Commonwealth Bank London.  I did not need it this time but I don't like to be without a "nest egg" in case I get landed in England for a long time - Must rush over to the station now to enquire about trains. With fondest love to yourselves & Pat I am your loving Son Terence PS  Enclosed snap taken at the school
