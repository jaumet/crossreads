<p>being one, land a section each, &amp; by 6 a.m. there are to be 6000 British Soldiers on Turkish soil. At 4 a.m. several Ships are to make "feint" attempts at landing, in various parts &amp; then whilst the enemy are confused at which point the strength is to be &amp; the landing to take place, we &amp; 3 other Ships ship in &amp; get our men on shore at a  point already specified.  I presume the bombardment of the Turkish Forts will also commence about day break by our Battleships.  I guess it will be "some" sight tomorrow, I am going to arise at 4 a.m. &amp; get busy, doing my little bit of this huge operation.  What a surprise the Turks are going to get &amp; by pretty authentic accounts there are also 40,000 Germans there too. The "Queen Elizabeth" is here just at present but I suppose she will get away with the other Battleships so as to arrive there before daylight.  I have never felt so happy as I do just at present, since I've been away from Australia, at the thoughts of getting in amongst it. While we are landing, Battleships from behind us, will be bombarding the Turks, but the trouble is that the enemy have concealed guns everywhere. Tonight the 4th Officer  &amp; I made about 15 medals with those tags out of Capstan Cigarettes tied with ribbon &amp; we got a lot of the Sihks lined up &amp; we picked them out &amp; presented them with one each, at the same time mentioning some act of bravery that they had (in our minds) done.</p>
