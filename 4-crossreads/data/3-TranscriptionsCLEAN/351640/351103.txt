 Let us hope that some day after all our losses some real advance will be made by our side in a war theatre. It is disheartening to be stuck up everywhere. Almost makes one swear to think of it. We can but hope. For some days I have been wondering if you were informed about the torpedoeing of the ship somewhere south of Salonika with a lot of New Zealand nurses on board. Rumour has been busy for ten days and, confirmation appears to be with us. Hard to believe anything, even when one sees it. Mrs Parsons is good to take you out so often. Please thank her from me. I posted the letter to Dr Fisher thanking him & Mrs F. for being so kind to my Kitty. 
 Sorry to learn about Charley Regan. Must write to Mrs R. soon. R.I.P. Told you about Mrs Bacon in my last. Have not see her since Sunday. Mrs Sawkins has had a bad time with her savage. Wonder how she stands it? I knew Donald MacLaurin. often met him with his father in the gardens. You too forgot to end your letter. 
 A mail is expected Daily from Australia, & letters from you will be of late dates. 
 This afternoon with two other doctors I went for a trip round old Cairo. We visited the Nilometer where for many centuries on the upper end of Roda Island [Rhoda Island] the height of the flood waters was guaged. Close by is the spot on the bank of the Nile where 'tis believed that Pharoes daughter found Moses.
