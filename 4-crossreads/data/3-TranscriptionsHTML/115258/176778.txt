<p>so expect to get a mail bag any day now. I think in future you had better put signaller in front of my name and dont put B Sqdn - just 1st ALH Regt. is enough. There are three Wilsons in the Regt now, but every body knows me here - it is the base people that do the mixing up.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago I posted you a tin of coins -I got them from the Jews in Ayun Kara or Richon LeZion as they call it.</p>
<p>The Turkish money runs 10 Parras 1 metlig, 10 metligs = 1 bishlig. 4 metligs = 1 piastor Turkish. 110 Turkish Pts = &pound;1 or 97&frac12; Egyptian Pts. Here are the Turkish figures&nbsp; <sub>1 </sub>1<sub>r</sub> 2 <sub>r</sub>3 <sub>6</sub>4 <sub>0</sub>5 <sub>7</sub>6<sub>v</sub> 7 <sub>^</sub>8&nbsp; 9<sub>).</sub> 10. You read them from left to right just like ours.</p>
