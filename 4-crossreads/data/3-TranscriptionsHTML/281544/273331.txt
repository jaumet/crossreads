We left H4 at 10.30 &amp; on passing H.1 a High Explosive Shell burst about 50 yds off the line &amp; about the same distance from the main Road &amp; the Dirt splashed all around the Eng &amp; Trucks, We came back as far as Reigersberg where we received further orders to proceed into Pottenhook Siding for a number of Empty trucks &amp; put them into L8 Siding between Arrival Farm &amp; Hospital Farm, we picked up a few that were unloaded &amp; put them into L8, they are wanted to entrain the prisoners which are in the Compound</p>
