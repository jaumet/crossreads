  
 all morning to sort and distribute "Any letters for me?" "Is there a mail in?" That's the universal cry. They see me humping a bag of mail as big as myself. and stupidly ask "Is that mail Sergeant?" I generally say "No! you fool! its bread!" Cant you see? Did you ever see mail come in a bag with three red stripes with G.P.O. on it?" As the Colonial would express it, "They get on my nerves, dinkum they do" 
 Butler's horse got frightened this morning at the sight of a camel (so he says) and bolted. He was leading "Pharoah" the time. "Pharaoh" bolted for his life and was found later on wandering about the Camp of Lovats Scouts and bought home He had broken on of his reins 
 Major Goucher arrived last night and Lieut Potts but they were sent back Heliopolis again this morning No room for them here.
