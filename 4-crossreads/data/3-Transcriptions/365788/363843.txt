You were a dear Sister to think of sending it. I hope to go up to Ghezireh in a week or so, if we have not by then been sent to some other front afaire. &ndash; I was very sorry to hear that Will had been so poorly &amp; trust he is quite himself once more.</p>
<p>This camp is on the old battle field of .<br/>Some days after duty I explore the very old trenches looking for Curios. The weather here is very lovely here just now. When I get to Cairo I mean to look up Mrs Robinson, if I can find her. From where I <strike>am</strike> sit I can see a sort of tower like monument which they say was erected in memory of the men who fell near the spot.<br/>Thank you very much for having sent me Xmas gifts by Beatrice Hasson</p>
