<p>Fri 12th<br/>Nelson went around to Bde H.Q. this morning to see Major Williams &amp; give an explanation of the 'phone failure last night &amp; he told Nelson to fight it out amongst yourselves; Nelson thought there would be no more about it; But an order came through from Bde this afternoon asking for a written report on the case; I was caught on the same thing while on duty a little after 4 oclock this afternoon, &amp; was told by Ser Maj Latham that they were going to bring this 'phone in &amp; that we would have to do all message work, if this comes off I think I shall apply to go away for a spell with the next lot; We had a good shower of rain this morning but it is nice and sunny this afternoon &amp; the air is a little nippy; I put the morning in making fruit tarts</p>
