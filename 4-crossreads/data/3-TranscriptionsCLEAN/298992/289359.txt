  
 All the censoring is done in the Orderly Room, though I don't think I am well enough in yet to get everything I want to write through. However there is no harm in trying. No places, dates or destination are to be mentioned, but I'll risk the Censor. As I suppose you will have guessed we did not call at Melbourne, nor Adelaide, and are now nearing Albany, where we  call . We struck the storm on rounding Gabo Island and it has kept on right up till now, though I expected it a good deal worse coming across the Bight. I'm afraid none of us shall get ashore at Albany, as probably we shall only be there an hour or two, but if any one does go ashore - naturally the Orderly Room Staff, have preference !!? - as in Thompson's case on the "Bec".  Before long I hope to be sleeping in a comfortable berth in a cabin. Two of the lads here have a cabin to themselves, and another fellow & yours truly are getting on the scent, and are going to see what can be done. If theres a spare cabin we shall have it, if not - well we're no worse off. As it is we sleep in the Orderly Room, just 2 of us, and that is better than in the Troop Deck, amongst 150. Our deck was flooded in the gale. The Company in the nose of the boat were washed out, by having their booby hatch carried away by one of the seas we shipped, and there was some 3 feet of water in the lower deck where the were camped. 
 Will write again soon.  Address any letters that may come to me at the address left behind, and tell Mother to send some socks with a packet or two of smokes in them occasionally. 
 With Love to you all 
 Alan.
