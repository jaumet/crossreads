<p>if something is not done shortly we will have no men to move our horses. Two horses with colic last night. Oh what a lovely Vetry officer we have he prescribed or tried to, and then asked me what I had, I told him Nitrous Ether, Aromatic Spts Amonia. He said 2 oz of each in a pint of water, and then he went on to say, give also one ball Ammon Carb and one Aloetic ball, and to cap all a gut full of water. I got the drench ready after a lot of sniffing and smelling by the Vet officer I started to give it, he then took the drenching horn out of my hand, and was showing me how to give it. The result was something to remember, he poured the lot over me, He then handed back the horn and walked away. The more I see of him the less I think about him.<br/>The Turks seem to have plenty of ammunition they are pumping it in this morning. German aeroplane over again, getting very daring. Without doubt the Turks are a brave lot, they are giving us about as much as we want.<br/>The Asiatic guns are blazing away just now 11 A.M. Trying to find the French 9.2 guns at the back of our lines</p>
