Left Tel-el-Kebir this morning about 10 a.m. Reveille went at 4 a.m. and we were kept going packing and loading until we left. (3.30 p.m.) Have been loading & unloading all day. Nothing to eat since 6 a.m. We are now at Ismalia on the Canal and are going over about 10 miles on Asiatic side Ismalia seems a fine town with some beautiful buildings & gardens. one of our ambulance waggons went over the Pontoon Bridge across the canal but the horses and drivers were fortunately saved. Our Brigade is again in the first line of trenches, but we don’t expect much fighting. The days are very hot lately. The Canal is very narrow here not more than 100 yards. We came on about a mile on Arabian side of canal and camped.

Tuesday 8th – today we are packing up preparatory to moving on to firing line. We are preparing each Section separately so we will probably separate. We have been pitching tents all day

Same old routine drill again today. The Colonel left us for good to-day. He is now D.D.M.S to the 1st A.A. Corps. We don’t know his successor yet but we will certainly have old bumble-footed Chapman for our Major. Today is a half-holiday as usual. No sign of us moving for a bit yet.

I was included among a few picked out today to learn semaphore signalling. I am getting along alright with it and it is very interesting work. I understand Major Phipps is now our Lt. Col
