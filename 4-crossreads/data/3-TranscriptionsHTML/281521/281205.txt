<p>14/4/17<br/>Begnatre<br/>sound of shell explosions &ndash; big &ndash; in advance of this town place. Early this morning was a terrific bombardment and a heavier and louder crackle of machine guns going mad than ever heard before. About 5 pm the Colonel was warned to stand by ready to move and that we would hop over in the morning at 5 am. Great excitement and bustle. Extra bombs, bomb buckets, jackets, gloves, pistols, cutters, mats etc all issued. Officers assembled and given scanty orders. After waiting a long time we received orders to move and that we hop over the day after tomorrow. Set off and met guides at Distillery and from there pushed on in file. Our m.g. [indecipherable] and cookers should have gone on ahead in daylight but followed in rear of each company and consequently took time to unload and blocked the traffic. Several big tank traps and a couple of old ruined villages en route. Coming into Montreuil were some big guns belching fire and smoke and loud sounding</p>
