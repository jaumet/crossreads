Friday 7 December 1917
Still at Malta & remaining till Saturday. We had trouble in getting here & it looks as hard to get away. The Egyptians some years ago had a small NAVY & they set out for Malta but could not find it!!! returning to Alexandria they said, Malta "mafish" which is gypsy for means "finish". Visited the Church of Bones 2500 Skulls & bones of the ancient defenders of Malta are arranged in Tiers in a vault, gruesome!!
[The remainder of the page crossed through.]More lace today so the wife should be busy in Cairo with sewing. We have our meals ashore as Dolly likes to get away from the Steamer.
