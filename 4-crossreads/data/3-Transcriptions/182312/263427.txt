<p>Armentieres is quite a big City and was before the war a big</p>
<p>milk centre.&nbsp; It is almost the size of Marseilles but of course</p>
<p>it is dead now, all the big warehouses, banks, etc. are closed</p>
<p>up and the railways and tramways no longer run.&nbsp; The tramway</p>
<p>system was a regular net work showing that it must have been a</p>
<p>busy spot in its days.&nbsp; Most of the smaller shops are still</p>
<p>open and there are two very fine afternoon tea shops where</p>
<p>officers out from the trenches sip tea and eat strawberries and</p>
<p>cream and forget about the war - to properly forget it you want</p>
<p>to stuff wadding in your ears to keep out the never ceasing row</p>
<p>of the gun fire.&nbsp; The strawberries by the way, just at the</p>
<p>present, are as big as ping pong balls - some even bigger.&nbsp; We</p>
<p>are not a bit interested in war news here, we get quite enough</p>
<p>war of our own.&nbsp; Even the every day joke about the number of</p>
<p>prisoners the Russians have captured fails to raise a smile these</p>
<p>days.&nbsp; There is one English weekly, The Tatler, which makes a</p>
<p>point of not mentioning a word about the war.&nbsp; It is very</p>
<p>popular here containig as it does mostly photos of actresses and</p>
<p>the like - something away from the war.&nbsp; Most of the stuff you</p>
<p>read in the papers about the war is all piffle.&nbsp; A few lines</p>
<p>tells all the news, and the rest is bunkum - interviews with</p>
<p>&quot;Anzac Heroes&quot; who never left Egypt, and the like.&nbsp; Everybody</p>
<p>here is disgusted with all this prominence given to Australians</p>
<p>on the Western Front - prominence at the expense of the Imperial</p>
<p>and other Dominion troops who are really bearing the brunt of the</p>
<p>fighting.&nbsp; Its Anzac this and Anzac that.&nbsp; Any little thing</p>
<p>they do is magnified to an enormous extent and when they are</p>
<p>doing nothing the journalists are equal to it, and manufacture</p>
<p>the most ludicrous stories of events which never happened.</p>
