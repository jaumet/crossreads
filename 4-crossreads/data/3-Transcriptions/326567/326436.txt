At 12 midnight our Train which contained our Coy (59) also Coy 60 also a Coy of Tommies. Artillery Boys. The Train consisted of about 20 coaches, Covered Vans &amp; a number of Waggons containing Guns. We travelled during the night very slow averaging about 15 miles per hour passing Rouen during the Night at about 12 noon we passed through Abbeville, a large Town where a large number of Japanese were building a new Railway also a lot of German prisoners working on an embankment. The Country &amp; Scenery en route was beautiful. From what I have seen France has very little unoccupied Land, every available piece was under cultivation of some kind. Abbeville has a very large Locomotive Depot &amp; we expected to be detrained there, any how we were dissapointed as after a few Minutes stoppage for Loco Purposes we left again at 12.15 Pm &amp; still going slowly we arrived at Etaples</p>
