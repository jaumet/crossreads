This man had been in London for three years. He was a Syrian. He said that he had tried our principle here but had found it of no use. He put up a notice to the effect that all his articles had one price and one price only. The result was, no sales the first day, no sales the first week, no sales for the month, so he gave it up in disgust and conformed to the custom of the other merchants in the bazaar and practised the bargaining principle. Another man we came across, a big, burly fellow seated outside the door of a brassware shop, engraving a large brass plate. He broke into conversation with us as we stood watching him at his work. He told us, a party of three we were, our correct ages much to our amazement. In conversing with him we learned that he had been in London. He had made his livelihood there as a conjuror and he proved to us that he was a conjuror by doing a few tricks with a coin. As we left him he gave us a hearty invitation to come back again.

There is one thing about these men, they are very, very, shrewd. They have a fine persuasive manner with them.

It is pretty difficult to express in words the fascination of these bazaars. Personally I have never enjoyed anything better. I have met chaps who felt like myself in this respect
