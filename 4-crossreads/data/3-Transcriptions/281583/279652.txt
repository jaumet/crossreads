<p>25.9.16   Monday</p>
<p>The weather still remains fine &amp; everything is nice &amp; dry underfoot. Misfortune has at last overtake me in that I have become "chatty" [(Lice)] However I am working hard to rid myself of them &amp; hope to succeed ere long. I have been very lucky to escape them for so long but this fact does not make them any the easier to bear.</p>
<p>I went for a stroll last night &amp; ended up at a big farm house near Boshepe, The people were very hospitable &amp; insisted on us calling on them again.</p>
<p>I have caught a cold in the throat the first in many a long day, but hope to shake it off in due course.</p>
<p>There is a nice breeze blowing today &amp; &amp; from where I am sitting I can see the huge arms of the Wind mills all moving round &amp; round &amp; grinding the wheat whilst doing so .</p>
<p>The front is gradually becoming more active the artillery fire is daily growing in intensity. The results of the late Zepplin raid over England is very gratifying &amp; the news of the destruction of 2 Zepplins caused much satisfaction among the soldiers. Unfortunately there was more severe loss of life than formerly, but a lesson of this kind will take the daring out of others.</p>
