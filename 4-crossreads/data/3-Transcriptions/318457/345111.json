<p>the day before we arrived.</p>
<p>On Sunday 13th the ceremonial unfurling of the Flag took place on the parade Ground, near the jetty. Some hundred of the RANR and troops were ranged in the ground round three sides of a square, the "Australian"  band being near the centre. A flagpole stood in the ground near the centre on which the flag was to fly. Major Heritage [?] read the proclamation in the name of the King on behalf of the Brigadier. Several salutes were given especially when the Admiral and staff arrived and then when the flag was unfurled, a Royal Salute.</p>
<p>About 80 native police and about 100 mission "boys" marched to the ground. The police had been sworn in and seemed quite contented and cheery. The looked to be a fair lot of men, able in body and neat in appearance. They are black in colour, with thick fuzzy hair, the hair in some cases being coloured with lime making it "ginger" in appearance. The Proclamation was on fair and just lines, stating that non-combatants would be protected also private property etc. Many residents, Germans and others were also present.</p>
<p>It was a ceremony worth witnessing and to most of us unique.</p>
