Sunday 18th
Reveille at 5.30 it was very pleasant to wake up and smell the sea air once again. I hopped out and had a salt water bath, which was just great, being such a huge crowd, we have our meals in 3 sittings. We were last and had breakfast at 8.30 Jolly poor Break, it was lumpy porridge, bread and very little butter, and coffee. Everyone is very glad this trip is only a 5 days one We left Alexandria at 9 a.m. The Band played a lively tune, and as the tugs hauled out, we had a farewell glimpse of Egypt. I don't think any of us are sad to leave, although we have had some good times there. I am sitting on deck writing this. There are guards posted all over the places on the look out for submarines. The 8th are "at last" embarked on the "Great Adventure" I wonder what they are doing home about now.
Monday 19th
Hopped out of Bunk at 5.30, rolled my blanket and had a hot salt water bath. Today we take 2nd sitting potatoes and for teaBread, butter and a little jam. Breakfast today. coffee 2 eggs bread and butter. Dinner same as yesterday. The weather is glorious, and the ship hardly rolls at all. A wicked looking destroyer showed up this morning and is keeping us company. She keeps Zig-zagging in front of us evidently on the outlook for mines or submarines; and makes us feel a bit more comfortable. We had some practice this morning in putting on Gas Helmets. I don't think anyone is sick, as they always muster at meal times and the arrival of the orderlies with the tucker is greeted with loud cheers. A big wave came through the porthole at breakfast time and soaked us few who were seated near. The crowd are all in good humour and laugh at everything. I must see if I cant write home, or someonewill be getting wild.
