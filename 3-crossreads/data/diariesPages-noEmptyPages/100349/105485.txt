Three incendary bombs dropped into the Hospital grounds the other night, but did not explode. By the crashes I could hear all his bombs are not "duds". The gunfire from the defences of London is terrific, and the "Gothas" get a warm reception. Still kept in bed. Swallowing gallons of dope. Received a bundle of letters from the Base Post Office.

This Christmas Day is vastly different from the last. Had an enjoyable day although I spent it in bed. The staff here worked hard for us and, the mistletoe, and other ancient English customs were celebrated. Generally the life in this ward is very quiet. The weather outside is mostly foggy. A chap in this ward has first come from the Italian Front, he tells some interesting yarns.
