The Hun has undoubted superiority in the air and brought down 4 of ours yesterday. Our chaps need much courage to face him with such inferior machines. The men are many wearing picklehaubens and caps. "Jonah" created a sensation by donning a tiny boxer hat. All our transport moves into here today. It has been a pretty little village in peace time. Stewart and Bunning were in during the afternoon and have no news of any move forward. 
The cooks pitched a tent for me in the front of the Bank ruins. Read and wrote quietly in this village for the for the fringe of which there was last night a stiff encounter. Just about dark all horses were removed to the rear. Macgregor dropped in and his talk of heavy shells sufficiently disturbed me to send O.P Hunt ahead to search for a deep dugout. He will probably put something heavy in tonight. It is not often that our QM is ahead of the Battn.
