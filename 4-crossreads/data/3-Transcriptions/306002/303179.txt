<p>6.6.15<br/>Sun. 6th.  An order came out late last night that there was to be religious services this morning, but as we were on duty until dinner-time we did not attend.  Everything the same to-day as usual &amp; no armistace.  It is rumored that 18,000 Turks have been cut off by the English &amp; French &amp; will either have to surrender or be annihilated.  About sundown a few Jap bombs were fired into the Turks trenches.  Complained to the Dr. this afternoon about my cold &amp; received some pills for it.  Flies are getting very bad here.  All precautions are being taken against diseases &amp; colds are the only sickness to be found.</p>
