  Personal  [This page crossed through] "Sitting" on a  Board  on a horse that was killed. After hearing the evidence &amp; visiting the Body &ndash; The Board  having viewed the Body  found that the Horse was dead!! etc. etc. thro' anti aircraft gun no blame being attached to anyone!!! etc. etc. Since my wedding has appeared in the Papers find I get much fewer letters &amp; fewer PARCELS, still the wife makes up for all that. Re U.S.A. we had an order to recall all American [indecipherable] some time ago - the reason was that some Yankee bombs had been filled with sawdust, of course this may be a libel.
