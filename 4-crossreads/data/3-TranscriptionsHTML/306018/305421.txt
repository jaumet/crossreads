<p>April 1917<br/>Gaza but had to leave it again.  The 5th &amp; 7th Light Horse had a scrap with the Turkish cavalry &amp; punished them.  They had to leave because the Turks brought up some mountain guns &amp; shelled the horses.  We had only  a few men wounded with bombs &amp; shells.  We saw a great air fight in the afternoon.  4 enemy planes were over us &amp; 2 British.  One of our planes flying very low was suddenly dived on by an enemy plane above.  At the same time the other British plane dived &amp; fired but suddenly <strike>plane</strike> it broke into smoke &amp; turned over &amp; over like a fluttering piece of paper &amp; fell to the ground.<br/>We got back to the wadi at 10 oclock &amp; had a few hours sleep.  We had only 5 hrs sleep the whole time since Sunday night &amp; I don't think any of us before had had such a strenuous time.</p>
<p>Friday 20th<br/>The Turks during the night advanced to the Wadi &amp; our troops drove them back &amp; took a well they had occupied.  Our A Squadron captured 6 horses &amp; inflicted some casualties on them, so also did the armoured cars</p>
