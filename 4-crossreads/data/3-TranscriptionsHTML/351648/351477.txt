<p>the feeling that its only temporary &amp; that I shall wake up shortly &amp; find myself dashing off to a midwifery case in the middle of the night with my little black bag &ndash; these nightmares always recur.  Now tell me more about your book, I'm very interested really &amp; hope that I shall have a copy sent me &ndash; what's it about?  Is it a problem that you have solved?  Or is it adventure? please tell me all about it.</p>
<p>I am posting you a photograph that I had taken when in London last, I am really awfully sorry <strike>if</strike> that you haven't got one before, I'm sure I ordered one to be sent you, I hope it will arrive safely &amp; will help you not to forget me quite, for I fear that before we return we shall be very hazy memories in many peoples minds, either we shall be dim recollections or looming giants with habits quite different to what <strike>will</strike> we shall be expected to have either almost forgotten or glorified &ndash; its the latter that will be by far the most trying.</p>
