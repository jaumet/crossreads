The population consists mainly of Japanese Eutropean and Blacks. The head of the town got a black<br/>boy to go up cocoa nut trees for nuts and we eat and drank the milk till we could not get anymore down. Next we visisted the hospital and then went around the island. Saw some sugar cane and thought we would like some so I volunteered to pinch it but got onto a hornets nest when I was cutting it and got stung in the arm. That was enough for me So we proceeded on our way We next visited some gardens and then went to the Artillary barracks they were very nice to us there The Garrison were compulsory body from Queensland. We then went back to the town and visited all the most popular places there including a church which had relics of a shipwreck that happened somewhere near here We meet some very nice people here and they tried to make us all at home even the Japanese Just for a few drunks knocking around every one was well pleased for their holiday ashore well its time to go aboard now So am going to get some cocoanuts to take on board. We are leaving here tomorrow morning so will see the last port in Australia for a while. Am going to bed now good night.<br/>(Monday 22nd)<br/>Left the wharf at 7 am with lots of cheering and proceeded to sea Dropped pilot at 8 am and proceeded West Passed a light house.
