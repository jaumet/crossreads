Villers-Bretonneux
a Hun. The road was now thronged with guns and limbers and all kinds of transport. We passed along passing several badly wounded men limping along with the help of others. Outside a little Dressing station was a group of Huns. One had been struck through the face and kept raising and lowering himself on his stretcher groaning with agony. Others all bloody also lay around. A little further on lay what appeared to be a long dead German corpse with a dreadful face all torn about. While looking at it one of its hands raised and lowered itself. A Hun plane did a daring reconnaissance was forced back by one of ours. Passing over our front line the smell of phosphorus from our ?few hours ago" bombardment was very noticeable.
