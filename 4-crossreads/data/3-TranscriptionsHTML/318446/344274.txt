<p>Asking for an explanation, here we found that we should have gone to the Anzac Water Convoy Camels not the C.T.C. (as it expressly directed).  Thither we repaired &amp; got our three camels &amp; took them to the 2nd L.H.F.A. &amp; I loaded them up, while Riches went back to Khan Yunis to get our blankets etc.  Then I brought them back here (the Anzac W.C.C.) &amp; here we are living having made a house out of the load of stuff.  What we are going to do next Lord knows, however we are very comfortable here with natives looking after our horses &amp; nothing to do.<br/>Our front line trenches are about 3 miles ahead &amp; occasionally there are outpost scraps &amp; artillery duets but otherwise things are very quiet.  Curiously enough, though they have a splendid target so far the taubes have not bombed us &amp; I am told they have not done so for weeks!  Why I don't know.</p>
