I have not got your parcel yet but I had a beauty from Laurel yesterday. I thought when they told me there was a parcel for me that it must have been yours but never mind it is still something to look forward to. We are out of the line now for a spell we are real glad too as we had a couple of stunts in this time. The last one was made very lively by his intense shell fire we were kept busy for three or four days. I was hit in four different places each off a different shell but did not get them hard enough for a blighty. I had a piece of skin knocked off
