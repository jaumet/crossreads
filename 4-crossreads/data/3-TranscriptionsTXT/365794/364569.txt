 Sunday 17 [16] June 1917 [1918] Day off &amp; very enjoyable one.  Visited during a.m. by Matron.  S. Talon sitting on bed springs up, Matron says this is how Home Sister wastes her time, Oh no, says F.E.H., not wasting it, talking of "spiritulism".  Are aren't you, aren't you? delicate sarcasm, invites me to room it being cooler. 3 p.m. gardens zoo studies, 4 p.m. tea, 6 p.m. church.  C. Garland who has previously threatened me "preaches" at me as threatened &ndash; quotes, a sister who has her own P.H. in Aust. when ill with a dangerous complaint tells him, "She understands her pts. better now".
