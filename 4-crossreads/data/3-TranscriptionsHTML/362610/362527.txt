<p>Tuesday 7 Nov. 1916<br/>A most miserable day to adequately describe which would be difficult. The rain was icy cold &amp; drove in everywhere, falling in torrents occasionally, then giving place to hail, then to sleet. The mud was worse than ever &amp; one felt full of pity for the poor frontline fellows. The General did not go up the line so I was hardly out at all.</p>
