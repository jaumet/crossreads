  
 August, 1915 Thursday 5 Still here but move this morning it means an extra feed & one more night in a bed - I could not sleep bed too soft after the Desert. This will be the last ink I expect you will get sorry my writing is cramped - very pretty here & beautiful climate. As the Knight Templar is returning to Alexandria & it may be a long time before I get a chance to post, send this - 7 Hospital Ships are in the Harbour & we expect to do something about the -8"- with  Ache Bata  The men are in great buckle & so am I.
