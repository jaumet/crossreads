 Dear George, 
 Just a few lines in answer to yours of 15.4.18 &amp; to thank you for the Photos.  You &amp; I are alike in getting out of focus "&amp; moved" pictures, but I guess we'll learn some day.  Milton was on my staff but He was too much of a d&mdash; nuisance to me.  I cannot be bothered with Boys.  They are always wanting a different job so I put Him on Night Duty in the finish I think.  Of course He was willing enough &amp; you need only tell Him that.  I am glad to hear that Cyril is well &amp; that Jimmy Randall is able to carry on.
