<p>inland Passed East London yesterday evening</p>
<p>Thursday 19th<br/>Table Mountain sighted about 11 AM Anchored in Table Bay in the evening The A29 (Sunic) just beating us</p>
<p>Friday 20th<br/>Nothing doing all day except to look at the Town. It looks well between the Mountain or rather Mountains as there are 2 of them &amp; the sea. Hope we have a closer acquaintance. Quite a lot of small fish have been caught The cooks are makeing quite a god thing by charging for cooking them. Fishing is evidently quite a business as I have counted 97 small boats all around us this morning</p>
