<p>Thursday 29th<br/>Whilst we were enjoying ourselves at our sports meeting our gallant comrades attacked El-Arish and took it, the great reports coming through make me mad to think I am not participating, as they have the enemy on the run.

<p>Friday 30th<br/>More victories for our mates.  Magadaba has fallen and the Turks are in full retreat towards Bersheba, Light Horse doing wonderful work, whilst we are holding a sports meeting.</p>
<p>Saturday 31st<br/>They are fighting like Hell and are now in fertile country whilst we are still in the desert.  It was the last day of our sports,  B Squadron won the pennant but I did not pay a great deal of attention to it being too disgusted with the regt.</p>
