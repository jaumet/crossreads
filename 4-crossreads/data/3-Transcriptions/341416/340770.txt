<p>Sunday 14/3/15 Mena Camp<br/>It is now considerably over 2 months since I made any entries. In the interim training has been going on in the usual fashion. We have got thoroughly used to marching over the sand. One cannot march nearly so far as on a good road, but the hard road, after training has been constructed on the sand for some weeks, blisters the feet <strike>and</strike> tires the muscles and jars the joints. After a 15 or 16 mile march over the asphalt one day a great number were unable to go out the day following. We went out a week or so ago to carry out an attack and bivouac. We left camp about 4.30 and began the attack about 6 p.m. Our coy were in the support and did little firing. We had tea about 7.30 and mostly did waiting after that. Eventually and by slow stages we retired. We bivouacked about 12:30 and were up again an hour before dawn. Distant firing showed that the battle was not all over but we did not participate; and after waiting a couple of hours marched back to camp. We had only our overcoats and rubber sheets. It was pretty cold during the night and twice I got up and walked around</p>
