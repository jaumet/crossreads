<p>Tuesday 13.8.18.<br/>Had to go out to a job the other side of the village &amp; make horse lines for our H.Q. Got an Aussie mail &amp; a big letter from Marie. Should be some more mail tomorrow. Had lunch with a coy of the 2nd Pioneers. (Traves Lodge, Colin  Groves). We have just got orders to move south to Caix. Started off &amp; when opposite Bayonvillers old Fritz put over a few shells very near to us. We were just going to spell but decided to move on. It got some infantry close by. Passed through Guillaucourt &amp; landed here about 9pm just before the egg laying competition started. Had blankets for our roof, but roofs didn't matter, much as we were dead tired.</p>
<p>Wednesday 14.8.18.<br/>Had a walk through Caix in the morning. Gee the place is knocked about some. Haven't seen any fruit on the trees this side but on our side there was tons. There isn't any sort of furniture</p>
