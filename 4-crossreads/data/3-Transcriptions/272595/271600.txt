<p>Continuation of diary by Archie A. Barwick.</p>
<p>20th   This book opens at Harborne Hall &amp; I am sitting at my favourite window surveying the countryside for it is a very nice morning &amp; the sun is trying to break through the screen of clouds, I am going away this morning to "Harefield" but I don't expect to be there long for I am practically all right now &amp; feel as fit as a fiddle.<br/>Left the Hall this morning at 11.30 in motors which took us to Snow Hill railway station, here they dropped the whole party &amp; never even told us where we were going nor did they leave</p>
