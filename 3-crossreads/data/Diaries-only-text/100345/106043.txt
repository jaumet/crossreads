How I won the V.C. = continued =
    3
I had 500 rounds for my rifle
 of hand bombs I took 41
a machine gun was slung my shoulders
 I carried a spare periscope gun
For rations well all I took with me
was a tin of Fray Bento's or two
 in my breast pocket I planted
a nice army biscuit to chew
Then I waved a farewell to my cobbers
I was too much affected to speak
There are times when the bravest of soldiers
have feelings that render them weak
One tear, then I turned to the trenches
 charged like a lion at bay
Then I caught the words of our Colonel
crying Bonzer Gott, strafem, Hooray
you talk of charmed lives: I?d a thousand
as I rushed up that hill like a goat
I got 32 shots through my trousers
 9 shrapnel balls through my coat
Then a Japanese bomb burst beneath me
For a moment I gave up all hope
But it proved the best thing that could happen
For it pushed me half way up the slope
Then a 15 in shell came straight at me.
I hadn't a moment to shirk
But it struck on that hard army biscuit
Rebounded blew up a turk.
You doubt it? Well if you want something
The truth of this tale to endorse
Heres the biscuit ? that dent in the middle
is where the shell struck it of course
However that isn't my story
I got slightly wounded tis true:
