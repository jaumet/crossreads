<p>a quiet day.Thursday 2nd. Was told to do night work in hospital so had day free. Hours 10 P.M. &ndash; 7 A.M. but as patients all fairly right most of the shift is spent in bed. In the afternoon went out on a Greek boat to a storeship to get some extras. Fish margarine 1/- lb, Tinned fruit, chocolate etc. etc. Bought some extra chocolate to sell to the chaps &amp; made my boat fare out of it. This is a regular thing for a few of the fellows to do the crowd agreeing to pay expenses in this way. The Greeks prices are double in many cases of what we pay out on the ships. Nothing doing during hours of duty.<br/>Friday 3rd. Went for a walk in the morning &amp; a doze in the afternoon going on duty at 10 P.M.<br/>Saturday 4th. Received letter from Anzac. Weather still fine. Had a bath at well during afternoon then a sleep. Duty at night.<br/>Sunday 5th. Slept during morning. Went for a long walk in afternoon in afternoon &amp; came on some marshes were several men were shooting. After wild geese, ducks etc. One ass nearly winged me. He was using ball &amp; two shots just wizzed by &amp; buried themselves in the mud.</p>
