  
 Was down with a fatigue party this morning to get our rations such as they are, the food here is very poor & scarce Poor old Andy Anderson one of the originals was killed this morning, a piece of shell went right through his steel helmet & killed him instantly. A lot of our Australian artillery is in action today, they are firing like mad & have got the range to a nicety, the way they shell the wood in front of us is something terrific, all day long there are shells bursting in it from 3 in. to 12, I can tell you the latter send the earth & stuff easily 300 ft high & go off with an earsplitting roar, I have seen them uproot big trees, such is there power, our chaps have never stopped bombarding since we came into the trenches, I don't know whether you believe it or not but it
