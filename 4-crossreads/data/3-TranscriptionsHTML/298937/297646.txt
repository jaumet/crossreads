<p>yesterday, but as usual the thing was spoiled by a lot of the remainder breaking camp.<br/>We were supposed to have had leave today, but as about 200 men are missing we have not been granted it yet.<br/>We hope to get out at 2 p.m.<br/>I hear that a German submarine was chasing us not far out of Marseilles;  a French merchantman had a brush with one &amp; a transport following us.</p>
