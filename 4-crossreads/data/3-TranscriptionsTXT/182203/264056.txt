enjoying it immensely - on the balcony, on a stretcher writing home letters. It is beautiful here this morning but is warming- up, so shall have to go in about 10 o'clock.The hospital (general) is not so busy just now, so one Sister has been spared to relieve me. We are awfully busy in the Officers Ward - mostly Tommy Officers & some of them poor things.   Was delighted Saturday night to get Ethel's nice long letter of May 8th  & Belle's from Talbot of May 10th . So glad Belle is having a good holiday. Wish you could afford to go to a decent place together & do it comfortably. Had a nice letter from Alice Bower too, she is a good old sort, making time to write to me. Tell her I had a nice letter from Norman May 30th from France. He was very well & expected to go on furlong in a day or two to England.Dearest mother must get a p.c. for dear little Eddy - so with the best & fondest of love & kisses  I am                             your loving daughter                                                                                                                                                                                                                Edith.
