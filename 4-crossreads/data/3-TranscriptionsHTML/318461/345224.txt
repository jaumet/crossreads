<p>[Transcriber's notes:<br/>This diary covers the period from 20 March 1917 to 31 July 1917 when the 55th Battalion was engaged in trench warfare in northern France and Belgium. The diary includes descriptions of enemy bombardments, allied offensives, aerial combat, battalion casualties, military police duties, destruction of villages and towns, severe weather conditions, and army food, clothing and pay, as well as Herbert Harris's health and outlook on the war and his personal situation.<br/>The diary also includes a vivid description of Herbert Harris's longed-for "Blighty leave" (pages 44-48), his will, written on 25 April 1917 (pages 51 and 52), a newspaper clipping showing a map of the battlefield area within the triangle Albert-Bapaume-Peronne (page 50), and several pages of lists, rosters and assorted notes.<br/>Parts of the diary are almost in note form, with little punctuation and variable use of upper-case initial letters. Some line breaks have been introduced in the transcription to assist with readability.]</p>
