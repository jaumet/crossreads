<p>there to see you.</p>
<p>I hope that no one at home has had the Influenza badly, thousands of people over here have died from it, so it is not nice.</p>
<p>I have a lot more letters to write now, so must make a start on them. No more now, and don't grow too big before I come back.</p>
<p>lots of love &amp; kisses &amp; hugs<br/>from<br/>Dad<br/>OXOXOXOX</p>
