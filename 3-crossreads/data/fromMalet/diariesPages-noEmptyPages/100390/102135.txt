Ive been getting quite a few letters from various people lately. Letters are jewels in this life. 
One never hears much of politics in Aust. Where oh where are the Liberals, Labourites and Fleming the Anarchists?
Well Ive got little to say alas folks 
So will close with best love to you all 
Yours affectionately
Jack
