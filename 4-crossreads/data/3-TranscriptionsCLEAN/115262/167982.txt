Friday 3 August 1917.
Reveille 4 a.m. Saddle up camels & set off. A round-about kind of a march it was. Country in places limestone hills. These hills were very steep & camels advanced in single file till we reached the top.

We passed beside the old city of Cairo & near "The Citadel".
Leave from 4 pm till 9.30 p.m.
Got wristlet watch from jeweller 1st repair.
