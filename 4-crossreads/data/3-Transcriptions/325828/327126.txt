<p>Glad to forward them on to me.  The address then will be<br/>c/- Miss E.V. Lawson<br/>No 7 Derfald St.,<br/>Shrewsbury,<br/>Shropshire, Eng.<br/>If I can possibly have this coming Christmas in England with the Lawsons I would like to do so, but I expect to be in France in about 6 weeks time unless I can get on "ferrying."  A ferry- pilot has a good job (flying new machines across to France &amp; returning the next day) but it is fearfully expensive for a start.<br/>I must close now, with love to you all at "Cairnleith,"<br/>Your loving son,<br/>J Leo L. Waterhouse.</p>
