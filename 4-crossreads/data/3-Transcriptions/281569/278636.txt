<p>March 5, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Revielle as per usual</p>
<p>Horses exercised this morning then we had the day off, no mail &amp; no pay, so wrote letters in the afternoon.</p>
<p>One of our planes left for Assuit where we are rumored to be going to, the Lovat Scouts have gone also. Armoured cars have been making demonstrations daily &amp; the niggers don't half like it.</p>
<p>Played cards at night then did the next best thing turned in at 10 oclock.</p>
<p>Our arabic is still improving.</p>
<p>March 6, 1916 Monday</p>
<p>72 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Revielle at 6.30</p>
<p>Cleaned out the old bus &amp; finished the water flume we have been making but owing to the belt continually jamming we had to give it best.</p>
<p>At 5 oclock I got orders to go to Bahrasa, caught the train &amp; left Beni Mazar at 6.30 arrived at Bahrasa at 7.30, had tea in the Officers mess &amp; left at 8 the lamp proved troublesome right from the jump &amp; when crossing a canal it went out &amp; I found myself in a bursein crop got out &amp; made Beni Mazar at 9, got as far as Kilnich when I broke a valve, put up for the night at a merchants place who gave me a splendid feed &amp; I turned in at 1.30 after filling in the night with music.</p>
