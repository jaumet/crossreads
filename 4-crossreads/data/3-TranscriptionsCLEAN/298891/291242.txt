 8 Friday 
 Glorious day. Cooked & waited at Cafe. Called on Kath at Endell St. Hospital on my way there. Got home very tired. Miss Bland had me up to have a cup of tea in her studio. I was trying to have a sleep but youngsters squatted outside my window awakened me. Set to work to gain acquaintance with the typewriter which came from A.A. Smith.
