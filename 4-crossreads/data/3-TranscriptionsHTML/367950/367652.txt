<p>A patrol  of about 12 Bedouins tried to pay us a visit early last evening but they ran into one of our Cossack posts which are on duty around the place and a sharp volley was poured into them one camel being left behind.The Bedouin are still going.<br/>They were mounted on swift camels specially adapted for that kind of work They were no doubt a "feeler" for some Turkish Force further out in the desert. Anyway they had better not come "feeling " around here too much. I know that particular crowd wont . We are all in a glorious state of uncertainty because we don't know which way the cat is going to jump  We may stay here for weeks and we may not stay for hours and as to where we are going, no one can imagine.<br/>The horses are in real good condition and they are quite fit. Truth to tell I am not averse to staying in the desert in the least only those dreadful Taubes get me. I have a holy respect for them.</p>
