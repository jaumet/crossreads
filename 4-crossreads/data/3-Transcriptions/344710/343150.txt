<p>15.11.17<br/>Awakened 5.30 after a strenuous evening. I was billeting Sergeant and our Mess was a British Canteen.<br/>Ordered at a moment's notice to proceed to Messines village with 20 men (11 platoon, not my own) &amp; report to an 18 pr. Battery 400 yds. Left from there.<br/>Half an hour Later we got away and toiled up the first ridge.<br/>Passing Brigade we split into parties of 6.  A Long weary march.  The ridge has been very heavily shelled, the craters being the largest we have seen even on the Somme.<br/>Got well roared up for exposing our party on the top of the ridge.  Also got splendidly Lost at Last.  Orders were wrong as regards the Battery.<br/>Finally met an Officer with a map, &amp; at a Late hour we were dug in to an old trench, wet but fairly comfy.</p>
<p>16.11.17<br/>No sign of the R.E. Officers to whom I report.  I hear our job is to build an O.P. for the battery, just near the support lines.  Arranged for our rations with the Battery.</p>
<p>17.11.17<br/>Still no orders.  A quiet day.</p>
