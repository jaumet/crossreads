  
 Tuesday August 14th Very fine day. Had our fire alarm as the O.C. promised yesterday, went off O.K. Everybody in the camp is looking forward to Pay day. Was reclassified today & recommended for board by Senior Medical Officer. Went up to him this afternoon, but could not be put through, we have to go up tomorrow morning now. Another fellow & I went for a very nice walk round the cliffs to Portland, (we could not go into the town owing to it being out of bounds), & back by the Weymouth road. 
 Wednesday August 15th A dirty snob of an Officer came round on inspection of huts today & owing to things not being to his liking, he put the whole Company on C.B, it hurt the troops falling in for Roll call every hour from 5 pm till 9 pm. Went up to S.M.O this morning, but as he was very busy, our board was put off till 2 pm this afternoon, went up this afternoon at 2 pm, & my word they do give you a thorough examination, also ask  all the  a terrible lot of questions. I got B.2B.H, so I may get back to Australia after all, of course I have to go through another board before I get on a boat roll, this class will carry me back to Ausy.
