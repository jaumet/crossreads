<p>I was operated on &amp; properly stitched up.  For the next four days I did not do too bad &amp; was marked fit to go down to the base Hosp.  On the afternoon of the 30th I was put aboard the Hosp. train &amp; carted down country to Etaples, where we were taken to No. 24 Gen. Hosp. where I have been ever since.</p>
<p>This is now the 22nd of Oct, I had some ups &amp; downs &amp; at present seem as far off getting to Blighty as when I arrived.</p>
<p>Nov. 12th<br/>Am making some definite progress at last, temperature is down &amp; am feeling real good.</p>
<p>Nov. 18th<br/>Still going strong, marked improvement this week so am hoping for the Best.</p>
