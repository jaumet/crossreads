There is very little doubt that the allied Troops are the foreigners mentioned.

18 1915 men leave our Battalion today for Australia. Bath Parade in the morning, at one of the Mines. The miners on arriving at the mine change their clothes. which They hang the discarded Clothing on Grapnels which are then pulled up to the roof of the Bath House and the end of the pulley chain secured by a Padlock of which the Employe retains the Key. Women and children Boys of less than 16 years work underground. Children under 16 only work 9 Hours underground. Over 16 they work 12 above Below. There were two women working in the lamp room and I seen other women trucking. (I gathered the above information from the Rules pasted outside the mine office.) Right through this country if there are any easy Jobs going the men get them. The old man was much surprised when Andy mentioned that we might be sea-sick going home. He seems to have a dim idea that it is possible to reach Aussie overland. He has no idea of how far away it is although I have explained matters to him several times. He knows what I say but cannot realize it. One young chap in a middle class family here (fairly well educated too) though Australia Egypt were in England. He actually believed that Australia was in London.
