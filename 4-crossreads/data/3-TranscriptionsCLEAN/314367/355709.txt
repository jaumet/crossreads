to my wife in memory of a very jolly eveg in the Pacific with a German friend - We parted - the best of friends - I saw him again this morning & asked him to let me know if he wanted any drugs, lint or wool, or if I could do anything for him - We walked round his garden - I had only a lava lava on & was much admired by several dusky ladies - at any rate they stood & gazed on the white man with his white skin & scarlet lava - I named his plant life for him - Most of it I knew - Fitz - H & I bathed & swam & then off to breakfast -  Sick parade took 1 1/2 hours but only small things - I've allowed Johnson's stoker foe to go to the beach - Here the women cease from troubling - Not in Rabaul said I to the Corporal - Oh - No Sir - said the Co? - with a sigh - as if he felt it personally - we musnt let them ashore in Rabaul - Sir - If I thought anyone here was religious, which I don't, the Corporal might be thought to have prayed for 'all stokers'
