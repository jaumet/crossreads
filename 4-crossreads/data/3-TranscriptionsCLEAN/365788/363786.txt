There are such a lot of donkeys here and camels and the camels have two funny humps on on their backs. The people here ride camels and donkeys mostly instead of horses. When I go to town I will try and get a picture for you & one for dear little Tingse. There are a lot of people here called Arabs and they wear such funny clothes just like women and instead of hats most of them wear a funny thing called a Turban. Please give dear little Tings & Peter a hug and a kiss for me. Did you see any flying fish when you were coming from Australia? We saw quite a lot sometimes and one day we saw hundreds of Porpoises and they swam all round the bow of the steamer. Hoping to see you soon and with much love to mother and Auntie and my dear little Margaret from \Your loving Uncle Fred Daddy sends lots of love to you all
