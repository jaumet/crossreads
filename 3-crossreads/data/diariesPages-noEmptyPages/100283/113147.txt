we could hear the bombs dropping quite distinctly, must have been over St Omer 
Am very stiff sore this morning after the run of yesterday, I can hardly walk the majority of the men are the same you should see them limping about.
Had a lecture on French bombs this morning after this firing rifle grenades with our gas helmets on 
22nd Another grand sunny day we have been out on the range all day throwing and firing live grenades 
There was a bit of amusement caused while the throwing was going on some of the chaps who were waiting their turn started to throw clods of dirt at one another some one for a lark hit the officer in charge this narked him very much so he ordered the 3rd 4th 5th Div to fall in, we all thought lucky
