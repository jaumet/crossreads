On arrival at the camp I find the others are receiving pay    &amp; after receiving my 25 francs we take leave &amp; go into town, have a good dinner &amp; view the city until 7.30 pm. I think Marseilles a very nice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <strike>indecipherable</strike> town &amp; rather pretty. The people treated us very well. Parade in camp 8 pm &amp; at 9 pm march off through the town singing all the way, to a rousing send off by the population. They cheered    &amp; waved to us from every window &amp; along the streets. Such a scene one could not forget. Arrival at the station 9-45 &amp; after a great deal of marching about &amp; entraining, steam out at midnight on our long journey. Eight in one small carriage compartment with all our equipment is not conductive to comfort, but at 3 am I turn in, having eaten a great deal of the chocolate issued to us from the comforts committee &amp; sleep soundly.</p>
