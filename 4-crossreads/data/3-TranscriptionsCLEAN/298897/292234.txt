  
 some Greeks who had  two baskets of oranges & confiscated quite half of them.  It all happened in a minute; Greeks baskets & oranges were upside down, then a moment later all was quiet & the Greek was dusting himself down & no doubt swearing his hardest.  Attended church at night & had a good sing song of hymns.  Gambling is very rife at present, two-up schools etc running strong bets of 10 20 30 & upwards being common. 
 Monday 20th 
 Tried to get a boat in order to see the No. 1 A.S.H. crowd but could not manage it so spent the afternoon on the Pier yarning.  I had a letter to deliver to their O.C. concerning my transfer.  It read thus - I am loathe to 'lose Pte Gissing unless 'tis very necessary so that until you are able to promote him to Staff Sergeant at once I cannot agree to a transfer being made.  The letter was posted as I could not deliver it.  Turned in early but was disturbed somewhat owning to several tent mates getting drunk & making things disagreeable. 
 Tuesday 21st Heavy dust storm during the night succeeded by heavy rain about 10 oclock in the morning.
