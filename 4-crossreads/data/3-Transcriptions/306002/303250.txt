<p>18.8.15<br/>Wed. 18th.  One of the Lenster boys was shot dead through a loop-hole at Quinn's last night;  by finding men for outpost duty at Hintons Post &amp; at the end of this gully &amp; at the Bloody Angle, together with fatigues during the day time our Regt. is getting an exceptionally hard time just at present, &amp; every day there is a sick man or two sent away, there are not many of old lads left &amp; what are left have nearly all been sick &amp; are run down &amp; should be sent away for a spell, but all the posts around Monash Gully are rather weak &amp; it would be very risky to weaken it further by sending anyone away that is still strong enough to show fight, we are also on a better diet again rice &amp; desicated vegetables being issued to-day, also a ration of coffee, but I believe we get no more coffee.</p>
