November, 1915Sunday 21The Turkish Rifle is a "mauser", but not finished quite as well as the ones the Boers had & no double report is heard like the old Mauser. Posted Diary yesterday. I used a bit of the Independent to skim the scum off my tea today. glad to read of course The Sheep skin waistcoats are most useful, the wool turns the rain & when not worn the waistcoat makes an excellent hipper - i.e. buffer t'wixt your bones & the earth. The Fleas are not quite so bad & I am getting better at catching them it is a fine art to tell whether a Flea is walking on you, or merely circling you with his back as he crawls along the shirt & it makes a difference when you proceed to capture in the Dark.
