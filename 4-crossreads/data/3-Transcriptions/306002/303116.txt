<p>21.4.15<br/>Wed. 21st.  Five o'clock reveille this morning, had an early breakfast, saddled up, &amp; then had to stack our kit bags in the Mess room.  We then pulled down the tents, &amp; stacked them, &amp; left the Aerodrome camp at 8.30.  We went through Heliopolis into Cairo, &amp; then on to Maadi, we arrived there about 3 o'clock &amp; had no chance of getting dinner before 3.30.  We were very hungry otherwise had a fair good-day, saw Alick Samuels &amp; Perritot after tea &amp; then went to the Stadium &amp; witnessed one or two very willing goes, retired to bed at 9.30.  Idleboy is still lame in the shoulder &amp; I rode one of Edmund's horses.</p>
