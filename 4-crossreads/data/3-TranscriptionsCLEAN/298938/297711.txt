know,  it is worrying.   I almost wish she would come over here & marry me.  It would be better I think.   Anyhow letters should come soon.This week is the anniversary week of my trip from Alexandria to the Peninsula.Shall I be here or in France, or back in Australia this time next year?Either of the last two I imagine.Have heard from Dad & Lily Vi & Ernest & Frances, also from Rushbrooke, who simply sent the card with "absolved" written on it.A short way of forgiving me for not calling on him.
