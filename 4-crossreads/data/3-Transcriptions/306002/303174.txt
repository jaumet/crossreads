<p>2.6.15<br/>posts, Penny, Smithers &amp; I came down the hill &amp; made a dug-out between Marsh &amp; Howarths.  A Sqd. is on duty to-day on the telephone, B Sqd. tomorrow, &amp; C the day after.  We were going for water this afternoon &amp; at the danger point in Shrapnel Valley a bullet fell between Calthorpes feet covering him in dust.  We had to go nearly to the beach before we could get water &amp; as we had a large biscuit tin full to bring back, we found it fairly solid work carting it up Pope's Hill.  I received a fine newsy letter from Edie Tomlins this morning.  Everything is very quiet to-day so far as fighting is concerned.</p>
