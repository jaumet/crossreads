<p>I&#39;m only a trooper, and so<s>me</s> many English people over here are such snobs. I fell terribly frightened. It is really very funny though is it not? but it seems really tragic to me just now. I&#39;ll keep this letter till tonight and tell you what happens.</p>
<p>Next Morning</p>
<p>Every thing in the garden is lovely. I called on Mrs Trelawny yesterday afternoon and she is a nice lady and she did not think I was a Major. She thought I said I knew Major Wilson. I had afternoon tea there and met a couple of officers wives and they all were very nice and I enjoyed the sfternoon very much. I went and saw Jim Leask in the evening. He is still waiting for a boat to take him home. He gave me his address and offered to go and see you but I told him I did not know when you would be in Sydney. His address is <s>L</s>&nbsp;J U Leask Leacholme Boyle Street Cremorne</p>
<p>Just at the foot of Spofforth Street</p>
<p>Love to Father and the boys &amp; yourself. I am Your loving Son Robert C Wilson</p>
