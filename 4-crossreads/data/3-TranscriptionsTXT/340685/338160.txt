27.3.16 I suppose now we have nearly completed a cycle of a week on board the routine will go on more or less motonously and we may find it hard to write anything fresh. To-day we were again with our beloved horses (I don't think) and after feeding them and cleaning them out a bit before breakfast we seemed to get on better probably as the organisation has improved a bit. We finished well before our meal hours each time and we were glad to get up on deck although there being a strong wind blowing spray was blowing about all over the decks. The night was very rough and all the movables were slid all over at a rather sickening angle and one of the men who is an old sailor was hastily hopping out of his hammock for a life belt when I woke up but I s'pose we are alright. It continued rough all night and the  next morning it was still rough but I think I would prefer this to the torridness of the Indian Ocean to come later.28.3.16 our business to-day is to go orderlies for our messes and all our duties are to bring in the food and clean up afterwards the rest of the time we have to ourselves and I played bridge this morning and entered up a little more of the above. I think it would be a better plan to fix a regular time for writing and think in future I shall do it after tea. The food is still very good although I can't get on too well with it and am probably a little out of sorts and like something sweet after each meal. By paying for it almost any sort of food can be obtained here and consequently a 'row' by the 'brave Australian youths' is pending as they argue that the stewards sell al the best of our stuff and leave us the inferior for our rations but after all very little is sold but it is just a little unfair and the crew here are a very mercenary lot. The latest is a big long rigmarole about censoring and if adhered strictly to would mean our just signing and addressing a blank
