They see me humping a bag of mail as big as myself. and stupidly ask "Is that mail Sergeant?" I generally say "No! you fool! its bread!" Cant you see? Did you ever see mail come in a bag with three red stripes with G.P.O. on it?" As the Colonial would express it, "They get on my nerves, dinkum they do"</p>
