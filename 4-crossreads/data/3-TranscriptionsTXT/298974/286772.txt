4as dawn was breaking. This was a wretched spectacle and many children clung like glue to their fathers. Embarkation was finished at 8.30 & we pulled out. The crowd were let on to the wharf & hundreds of streamers were thrown. Stuart was down on the wharf on duty, and Biden was Sergeant of the guard on the wharf, which was very nice.
Well Father I wont be able to write for a long time now. I will send any cables to Marion who will send them on. With very best love to all, & hoping grandma has improved
Yours affectionately
Dene
