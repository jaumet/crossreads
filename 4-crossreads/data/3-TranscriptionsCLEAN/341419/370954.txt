  
 S.S. Port Darwin Melbourne heads, 22nd Dec. We arrived here yesterday & went to the quarantine station here.  The quarantine Authorities came aboard with pads over their mouths & noses whereat there was much merriment & jocose remarks at their expense. 
 They have put us in quarantine for 3 days, so that all going well we shall leave on Tuesday morning & with luck should reach Sydney on Xmas day, where I at any rate shall call a halt for several days. 
 Meanwhile we have our Temps. taken & are shut into an overpoweringly hot whaling room.  It is an anxious time too for but Hush.
