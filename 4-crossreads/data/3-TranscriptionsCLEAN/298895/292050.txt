  
 nowhere have I seen the same amount of shrapnel used as here.  Shrapnel cases & pellets absolutely covered the ground & in one place were so numerous that they were used to form ed  a road.  Many dead germans were still to be seen in the last stages of decomposition & skulls were numerous.  After viewing such a battlefield one is convinced that nothing on earth can withstand our attack providing the artillery is sufficient.  Met a couple of tanks being salvaged one the "Creme de menthe" being rather an historic one.  Brought home some driving bands etc & a German bayonet.  "Thiepval" itself has disappeared but a mound with cellars underneath still remains & is all that is left of what was once the Chateau. Friday 20th April Last three days being changeable weather wet cold & fine.  Played the 8th football & won 16 to 6 thus upholding our record & that of the 1st.  Good news of our stunt at Arras & that
