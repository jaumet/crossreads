<p>1918<br/>Tue. 12th March<br/>Still in the Wachtstube.    Have had a fearful week.   This room is horrible.   Nothing but moans, morphia, and the sickening smell of ether, varied by daily visits to the Verbandzimmer to have rolls of cotton poked into ones internal organisation.</p>
<p>One sees awful sights in that dressing room &ndash; shell-wounds large enough to put a tea-cup into and foul-smelling putresient flesh are quite common.</p>
<p>Thick white crepe paper is used instead of cotton bandages.</p>
<p>Wed. 13th<br/>Princess Irene, wife of Henry of Prussia, (here Heinrich von Preussen) visited the hospital today.   She asked me polite inanities about Sydney.</p>
<p>A dowdily-dressed lady with most beautiful manners.</p>
