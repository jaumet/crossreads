  
 November, 1915 Thursday 18 Well I never got the sheep but passing one of men's Bivouac I asked him why he had his Biscuit tin covered with his  shirt  on the fire - i.e. Boiling. He lifted it & there I saw a leg of mutton, but he kept it covered so as his enemies might not steal it from him. My share was some Chops. Very cold wet night, & I'm glad to have my Gum boots but they are not good to climb in. Sad to relate the "Trawler" foundered with our Xmas Mails on board & some of my Diary to you will be missing, but cannot be helped, the sea was very rough.
