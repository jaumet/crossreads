 were readi to leav we manag to get some stockholm tar . This was easi to put on when we were finish we buri all the part of the boat so that we could not be found out at the last minut and dash our hope to the ground . We had procur a small German pocket compass with illumin dial . We had been studi strict economi all this time , and had manag to save up some biscuit and money . The biscuit came from occasion parcel we receiv , our friend give us their biscuit when they knew we were go to attempt this escap . We decid to leav on the 29th April 1918 . [Side note : to be underlin ] The Turkish soldier sentri on the work live in a big tent close to us and in leav we had to pass close by this tent . We did not have ani sentri actual guard us but they were station on the outskirt of the villag to block anybody- Turk or us from leav the works-. Howev we wait till there appear to be nobodi about and then we set off with our swag as quick as we could walk . We were afraid to look either side of us for fear we would see anybodi watch us . We got well clear of the camp and sneak along veri low to the ground we got into some low bush Just at this time we heard some men run toward us . Our heart came into our mouth for we thought that somebodi had seen us leav and report us and we were be follow . We lay down on the ground and kept veri quiet . Two men rush past us follow by two other men , evid sentri . Then three of 4 rifl shot broke the still . We then knew that they were not after us . When all had quieten down again , we move off . We were now pass through low scrub about 5 feet high . This afford good cover for us . The next thing in our way was the cross of the railway line , which we knew was guard and the road was also close to the railway . We want to cross these obstacl befor the moon rose . About 9.30 p.m. we got to within a coupl of hundr yard of the road and were approach veri cautious along the bank of a littl water cours we had just cross a small patch of wheat about 2 feet high when we heard somebodi run . We immedi drop to the ground . This man came from off the road and just befor he got to us he stop and seem to be look at us ; then went on . Whether he did see us or not I do n't know but he did not take ani notic of us . We were afraid to move for a long time , and dure this wait the moon rose and we knew we would have to spend the night close by . We could not risk cross the railway in moonlight . Howev we select a small clump of bush close to the road . We decid to spend the follow day in hide and then move off earli in the even . When daylight broke we found we were not in such a good hide place as we thought , for anybodi come close would have seen us quit easili . One man drive some cattl pass veri close to us , but he did not look in our direct . Toward the even three men rode by veri close to us . One of them look our direct . Evident he did not see us for they went on their way . Just after dark we start off veri cautious to cross the road and railway which we succeed in do .
