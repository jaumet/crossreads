<p>30th March<br/>To-day I caught the 7a.m. train to Ismalia Suez Canal. Arriving here at 10 am, having passed right along the desert en route (where thousands  of the infantry were marching from Tel-el Kebir to the Canal) &ndash; I made straight, on foot, through the small town  to the camp on the other side of the Canal which is crossed by ferry. Here is the cheerless prospect of sand so far as the eye can reach on the Arabian side, warships are continually patrolling the canal, destroyers being in evidence, miles of trenches &amp;  barbed wire entanglements on the Arabian side &amp; the camp extending for miles into the desert, the furthest about 12 miles out</p>
