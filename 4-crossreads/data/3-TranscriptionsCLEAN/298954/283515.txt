  
 I took one sip of the awful sweet soup (a favourite German dish) and then rushed away to be violently ill.    However, I came back and did full justice to the horse and sauer-kraut (with dried potatoes), which tasted delicious to me in my condition of semi-starvation. 
 Horse has a distinctive flavour and odor but is quite edible. 
 Mon. 3rd Sept. Last night was exciting - not to say thrilling. 
 After the lights are out in the hospital the iron covers are permitted to be lifted from the ports and a little air is permitted in.   (I have to ask Fritz to do this nearly every night - a German would never voluntarily open a window unless to look out of it.)   Well - the ship was plodding along as usual and everything was quiet when the clanging of the big electric alarms brought me from Dreamland with a rush.
