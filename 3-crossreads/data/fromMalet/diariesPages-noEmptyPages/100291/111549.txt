1917 Monday 2 April
Up betimes continue pulling down tents loading. Most of us leave for Aveluy in motor ambulances at 10.30. Arrive here at Aveluy Chateau once the residence of Baron Rothchild, a beautiful place, reduced to ruin by Fritz's shells. We are billeted in stable where I'm writing this, an imposing building with all oak fittings, in the stalls Set to work fixing up tents marquees. A heavy wind blowing, also heavy fall of snow came about 4 p m. transforming the scene in very few minutes. 
Receive parcel from Mary containing all the different Xmas Cakes from dear friends. but hard luck they were all mouldy more or less, but still the good wishes were there, all was right.
