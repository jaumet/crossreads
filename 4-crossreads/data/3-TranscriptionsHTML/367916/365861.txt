<p>3<br/>White who was O.C. of my brothers Squadron in Palestine. He is at present a cavalry instructor near here and has a house just a few minutes walk from where we are located. I met him accidentally in the street a few days ago and introduced myself. His wife came over from Sydney on our boat. They are awfully nice people and I am lucky to have come across them here.</p>
