<p>has been backwards and forwards between Australia and England half a dozen times on transport work, so it should b able to dodge the submarines, etc.<br/>We have had three Sundays on board to date and this day is set apart, as one of rest from duties &ndash; excepting those absolutely necessary &ndash; and for church services. There are three services, Church of England, R.C. and other denominations &ndash; different sections of the ship being reserved for each one. The principal service of the day is at 9 a.m., and at 6.15p.m. a united service is held. The services as a rule have a bearing on our Australian home and friends left behind, also on the dangers etc., of warfare, and [indecipherable] most impressive, the surroundings helping considerably in bringing our minds to the stern realisation of duty. The boys, however, do not like harbouring thoughts of danger, so quickly forget everything in this direction by reverting to their happy routine of games, sport etc. "Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you" is our motto and it is a good one to act up to. The three Captain - Chaplains are popular and are good speakers.<br/>One interesting feature of the trip has been the sight of "flying fish.' The morning of the 14 day out we were having a sun bask and all of a sudden saw three fish jump out of the water near the ship, and fly in all directions as if startled by our approach. Every evening and morning since then we have always seen this sight and it is a very pretty and interesting one to watch. The fish are from six to twelve inches in length and when one flies it is generally followed by any thing from 50 to a couple of hundred others. The length of flight varies &ndash; the majority flying from 30 to 50 yards and then diving into the water again but have seen some fly as far as 300 yds before diving. They appear to be of a silvery color and when the sun is shining on them they look like silver flashes in their flight. When a large number are flying at the same time you can imagine what a pretty sight it is.</p>
