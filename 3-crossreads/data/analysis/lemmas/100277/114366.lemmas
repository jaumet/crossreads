 We had to run the gauntlet in one place for about 200 yds , for we were quit expos to the German but they never shot at us , we then went through a shallow trench to the fire line , here we had a look at a job we had to do this afternoon , I ca n't make old Fritz out although he can see hundr of our men quit close to him he never shoot at them , they work all day long right under his nose real close to him , I think he is frighten of give himself away for at the present time he is hide anywher never disclos his presenc from fear of our gun which never stop night or day . The Colonel was up there also we had a short yarn with him then came back , had dinner such as it was a piec of dri bread water yes I thought I was lucki to have it one ca n't be too particular these time if ever I get back Ill be abl to sleep out in the yard anywher in all weather live on
