  
 poisoning.  His pain was awful.  As I was the only one who understood treatment I had to buck to.  Towards daylight sent for doctor who came but did nothing left me to continue on as I had started.  I fear he is very callous.  The patient improved during the day & was discharged Monday.  On top of that the men playing up on shore gave us additional work.  I had turned in about 10 p.m. but was awakened several times as to treatment for cases etc & other shortly after 12 the Doctor called me up to assist with stomach pump on a man brought on board drunk & helpless.  A messy job & one I did not feel fit for being bilious.  Then another man had to have a cut face stitched & broken nose bandaged.  The behaviour of many of the men is disgusting.  I heard it said that only the best are enlisting.  If so I am sorry for the worst. 
 Sunday. We left the wharf enabling the Bee to go alongside.  Admitted a patient suffering from Pleurisy who took a bad turn after tea & had to have a man up all night.  Once again Doctor leaves no instructions, all left to us, which means responsibility rests a lot on me as I'm supposed to know most  Sent a telegram to mother & posted several postcards.  Heard the five transports are in front. 
  Monday    Pleurisy man still bad.  Fairly large sick parade  I had a mild dispute with Padre but all correct later.  Left Thursday Island 8 A.M. & headed direct for Colombo.  Steering due west    Tuesday  23rd  a quiet day sailing
