  
 Thick Mess-dresses with crepe-de-chin capes, white caps and shoes for a change. Fancy dressing in style at a C.C.C. but on    such an occasion , one must look ones best. 
 We were escorted by our Colonel   &  the General's two A.D.C's. When we arrived there got a great welcome   &  strange to say I did not feel at all nervous. The dear General was most charming   &  said Now Sister Thistle-----  will you sit next to be [me]   &  your Matron on my other side - so O'Dwyer   &  I were each side of the Gen. 
 Then the other side of me was a Major Churchill (cousin to Winston) the Capt. Churnside, Capt. Bean, Our Colonel, General White. Sister Baker, General Corsowthers (cannot spell name)   &  then two other Majors. 
 It was a lovely dinner but shall go into detail when I return. 
 It was the first time I had worn my two stars but I quite forgot I had an extra star. The General is such a love   &  so homely, he cracked nuts for me etc. We dined from 7.30 p.m. till 10 p.m.
