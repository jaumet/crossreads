 was a prison pure simpl . We were among all the head it was no troubl to see that she was well born she carri herself so well , I felt quit proud of myself all this was a new sensat to me for I had alway been shi of girl but thing seem so differ now I seem lift out of myself as the say is , I am sure I am a differ man today , I can quit understand how it is now that a woman can have such an influenc for good or evil over a man . I took her home again that night a fine place she live in , as the next day was a general holiday I ask her if she would come out again , she said yes , so we decid to meet again next morn at 10.30 . I was there to time she woman like was about 10 minut late , what a day we had I shall never forget it , first of all we went out by train to the Red Braid
