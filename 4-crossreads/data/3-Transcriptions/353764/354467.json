<p>a lot of our fellows out &amp; to cap all we have to trek out to Serapeum No2 Railway Siding to draw 100 Wagons &amp; leave our old ones there.  This is a fearful job as the wagons have got to be man handled through deep sand &amp; loaded on the Trucks.<br/>The work all day has been cruel coupled with climatic conditions &amp; the job has to be continued tomorrow<br/>Reveille at 3 am to cross the Bridge early.<br/>To cap all a lot of us have been inoculated again &amp; I am feeling it very much &amp; as tomorrow will be my worst day I am not in a happy frame of mind.</p>
<p>16.5.16<br/>Am feeling as sick as can be &amp; am suffering absolute agony with the Heat, Wind Sand &amp; Inoculation<br/>We are now getting the Wind Hot &amp; strong which blows in from the Arabian Desert &amp; at times you have to lay face downwards to get free of the flying sand.  Every one of us are absolutely full up of this place &amp; we all pray to get out of  it.  I am afraid that some of the men will go out</p>
