<p>France,<br/>3rd September 1916.</p>
<p>Dear Os,</p>
<p>Have written several letters to both you and Chas lately, but have had no reply, so am wondering if things are O.K. with you.</p>
<p>Since last writing (after we came out of the offensive the first time) we have been up to the line again for a second cut at Fritz and am pleased to say am still on top.  We had if possible an even worse time than previously.  Had nothing spectacular to do in the way of charges, bomb fights etc., as before and beyond carrying out a few little stunts, simply had to hang on to our positions, while Fritz did his damndest to shell us out.  Imagine two or three of us in a shell hole with the gun (trenches have been flattened out long ago) for days and nights at a stretch, keeping a constant watch, while a big stream of shells of all sizes from the mere 77 whizz-bang to some that appear to be as big as Iron Foundries or Eveleigh workshops is landing round us all the time and keeps us guessing I can tell you.  I was fairly lucky.  Was only buried alive once.  Got a bit of a shaking up, but a rum issue soon put me to rights, and beyond nearly splitting my nice new uniform, no harm resulted.  You can take it from me though that we were a mighty pleased mob when our relief crawled out to us.</p>
<p>It was raining like blazes the whole time and things were pretty miserable, and you can guess we were some pictures.  If you ever see a moving picture entitled "Anzac Machine Gunners coming out of the Push" Its us.  We were snapped just out of the trenches.  We are now going off this front (Pozieres) for what they call a spell, though there won't be much of that wherever we go.  These Anzacs have made too good a name for themselves over here.  It doesn't pay.</p>
<p>Suppose you are getting it pretty rough where you are.  We had two months of Sinai, so have a fair idea, of what you have to put up with.</p>
<p>Let me hear how you are as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I have had several letters from Billy from England giving most glowing accounts.  They are starting leave again shortly so hope to see him before he leaves.  I hope he hasn't spent all his money before then.</p>
<p>Some time since I heard from home and all were O.K. then except the Dad who had a bad cold.  You of course heard about Aunt Mary's death.  It must be pretty rotten for the girls.</p>
<p>Nothing more.</p>
<p>Good luck,<br/>Your affectionate frere,<br/>Roy.</p>
