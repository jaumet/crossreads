<p>Saturday 17th June<br/>Definite orders for embarkation out &amp; we move off tomorrow night our transport has already gone.  The management of the transport of troops seems to be well nigh perfect, everything going off without friction.  Unless one is at the station itself, a few thousand men can be moved off &amp; none the wiser so smoothly do the arrangements work.  We had a swim in the lake today &amp; it very nearly proved a serious matter for me.  On taking a final dive I struck the bottom with my head narrowly escaping a serious injury.  As it is I injured my spine chiefly by wrenching some muscles or cartilage &amp; have to carry my head as in a splint.  The pain is not great in itself unless I move the head</p>
<p>Sunday 18th June<br/>Had a very quiet day mostly resting my neck but had to fix up my kit for going away.  My promotion to Sergeant was read out in orders in the afternoon three of us getting the promotion &amp; we had tea in the Sergeants mess.  After a bath &amp; clean change I hired a gippo to take my kit to the station.  All left camp abut 7 oclock &amp; the train moved out for Alexs about</p>
