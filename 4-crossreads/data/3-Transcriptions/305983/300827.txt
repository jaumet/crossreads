<p>in Switzerland &amp; the 4 men in same frozen to death. towards evening the wind was up to hurricane force.  Ballon passed today.</p>
<p>25/10/17<br/>The wabbler still has a good liver we say when he is like this that there is good news for us a regards the war.  Meaning the Germans have got a good dusting up.  Report of Russians losing another island in Gulf of Riga.  Also the German reports say that the Russian navy is talking about going into Swedish waters to be interned until the end of war &amp; the report goes on that the Swedes will take the boats but not the men as the food problem is serious in Sweden.  Also of the Russian Navy commander being captured. The German always seem to be able &amp; do make a good show when the public are uneasy.  this is another one of the dramatic moves to gall them.</p>
