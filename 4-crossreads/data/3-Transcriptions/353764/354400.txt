<p>The sun was sweltering hot &amp; the mirage on the Desert was very trying to the eyes.<br/>We arrived at the Ranges after an hours march &amp; immediately got to business.  I scored a fair average, but nothing to speak of.  I hope to do better tomorrow as my eye is now in.<br/>It was very inspiring to hear the thousands of bullets all rattling over the Desert &amp; one naturally wondered how on earth any force of men could possibly charge up in the face of such an awful curtain of bullets.<br/>I am going out again to-morrow, but I feel far from fit as I am very tired.</p>
<p>11.2.16 <strike>Thursday</strike> Friday<br/>Another hard day at the range &amp; returned very tired.  Have just been ordered to go out for another 6 days &amp; am quite faint about it as two days has played the devil with me.  I am sure I will be deaf when it is all over.<br/>I have seen in orders that the Osterley has arrived with some Artillery so am wondering whether Jack is among them.  Will make enquiries on Sunday.</p>
<p>12.2.16 <strike>Friday</strike> Saturday<br/>Finished off another day on</p>
