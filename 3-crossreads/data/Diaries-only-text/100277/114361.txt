was a most miserable affair for it rained heavily the whole time other roads don't mention them, we passed scores of big guns on the way up all covered up with tarpaulins ready for action whenever wanted, piles of great shells laying all around them, these shells for the big guns are generally placed on slides side by side in a row, for they are too heavy to juggle about easily, on the slides they can roll them right up to the guns, in some places the 6 inchers were almost wheel to wheel.
We reached "Delville Wood" after a couple of hours marching here we are camping out in the open among the great shell holes fallen timber, we have got a lot of fires going, at the present it has ceased raining, but we are all wet to the skin, this is the place where the S. African Brigade fought so well were pretty well wiped out, she is nothing but a vast cemetery has been turned over over by the Germans
