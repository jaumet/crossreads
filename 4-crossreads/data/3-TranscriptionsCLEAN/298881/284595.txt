Picked up a private car coming out and fairly flew along the road as far as Franvillers where we got into a R.F.C. Lorry which dropped 11/2  Kilos from  house .  We only had 48 hours in Amiens but I think it was quite long enough as there are no attractions hardly.  No gardens to speak of and no theatres except Picture.
