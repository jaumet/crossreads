  
 Friday February 23rd Rumor we are to move out on Sunday. Had a very busy time between 1 pm and 4 pm. The difference regarding numbers of patients between the 2nd & 4th division cannot pass unnoticed, the former has a great number more. Trod on a rusty nail, & my foot is aching very much. 
 Saturday February 24th Very sore heel.  Had it dressed in the morning & afternoon, also had a 500 Anti tetanus injection this evening. Received word that my transfer to No 2 Australian General Hospital had been arranged.  Received transfer papers etc this evening.  Will leave tomorrow. 
 Sunday February 25th Very cold & misty morning. Got up early & got packed up. Left Becordel at 8.30 am by one of the Ambulance cars. Waited on Albert station from 8.30 am till 4.30 pm. Through being humbugged about regarding the train we had to go in, I had to change three times, then we had to travel in closed in trucks. Got movement order from Railway Transport Officer. We stopped at Amiens for ten minutes, & while I was away getting some food, the train started off, I had to go my hardest to catch it, I may say I wasn't the only one either. After a lot of stopping & starting I eventually went to sleep, but as it was very cold I soon woke up & thinking it would be warmer with a blanket, went to the trouble of taking it off my pack, unrolling & rolling myself up in it, but I just got a bit comfortable when we arrived at Romescamp where we had to disentrain, it was about 11 pm then. Went to the canteen here (the most up to date canteen I have ever seen) & after having something to eat laid down on the floor & went fast asleep.
