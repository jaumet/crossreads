<p>No. 2 Gen. Hosp.<br/>Mena Camp<br/>8.4.15.<br/>My dearest wife,<br/>I have just received your two letters dated 26th &amp; 29th March &amp; was delighted to get such recent news from you.  I was just about to sit down write &amp; growl at not having heard from you when into my tent steps an orderly bearing your two letters.   You seem to have had a nice day at Ealing with your Aunt Elizabeth &ndash; from the little I saw of Annette I should say that she will prove a very great friend to you while you are in England.   I was pleased to hear that you were thinking of settling in Ealing &ndash; I think it would be much nicer for you all &amp; more especially for the children.  I have never liked the idea of those awful flights of stairs in Leinster Sq. &ndash; Sorry to hear of your Aunts Bella &amp; Jessie's break up but they must both be very old ladies.<br/>I think a <u>good high class</u> boarding house would be most comfortable for you;   if you took either a house or a flat you would have all the worries of housekeeping.    However you are on the spot &amp; you are you &amp; you know best, so decide for yourself, the best advice I can give you is "do everything</p>
