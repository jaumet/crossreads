<p>No. 2 General Hospital<br/>Mena<br/>Cairo<br/>Egypt.<br/>21.2.15.<br/>Dearest old Mrs.,<br/>I always seem to set about writing to you either when I am tired or else just a few minutes before the mail closes.   It is both tonight;  but I must send you a line to let you know that all is well   We have been having glorious weather &amp; I feel very much better than when I last wrote.   I have just returned from an afternoon jaunt into Cairo.   I went in with two other officers &amp; we spent the afternoon doing the Zoo &ndash; we saw some very interesting animals;  the ones that appealed to us most were the giraffes &amp; the chameleons the latter are quaint little lizard like things with eyes that roll about in an extraordinary fashion giraffes of course you are familiar with from our visit to the London Zoo.   By same mail as this I am sending a small parcel of odds &amp; ends.   I hope you will receive them all right.   I had them registered.  I gave them to my batman to post in Cairo but forgot to mention their value &ndash; when he came to register them he had to declare their value &ndash; he had no idea of the contents of the package</p>
