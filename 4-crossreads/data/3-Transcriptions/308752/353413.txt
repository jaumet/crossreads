<p>Of course we could not cope with the rush ourselves, three squads of Infantry who<br/>were doing fatigue duties close by, gave us a hand. It was funny sight watching them struggling along with a stretcher they not being used to this work, of course they is a knack in this work.  I suppose we would look just as funny, perhaps more so, carrying a rifle on our shoulders. Not being in the dug-out since 11 a.m. we were all looking forward to another good hot meal, at about 5.30 p.m. when we were at last clear of all the patients, but our luck was out this time everything had gone wrong in our home, some one had knocked over a tin of water &amp; the floor was like a swamp. The primus stove refused to act &amp; one of the details was trying to light a fire with wet wood, &amp; the smoke was suffocating. It was a great disappointment on seeing all this &amp; it did not improve our tempters. We were all more or less dog tired &amp; irritable &amp; the air was blue with language for a few minuted.  "enough said". If Bairnsfather had only been at hand he would have certainly made a fine sketch of the scene. Of course it was not very long before we had everything in tip top order again.</p>
