<p>Monday Sept 11th <br/>Trenches: showery: nothing doing except a few shells: "chats" are very vicious in this dugout: trenches very sloppy: got a few papers in the mail:</p>
<p>Tuesday Sept 12th <br/>Trenches: showery: nothing much doing: I sighted a working party of Fritz's &amp; one shrapnel got on to them at the same time &amp; they "imshied": "alarm" at night as a patrol was sighted near our wire:</p>
<p>Wednesday Sept 13th <br/>Trenches: showery: plenty of "minnies" towards the house on our left also a fair few shells kicking around: no wonder the Canadians had to fall back from that trench in front: them "minnies" would catch them lovely there: got four letters this morning:</p>
<p>Thursday Sept 14th <br/>Trenches: showery: pretty quiet all day: relieved by the 23rd at night: pretty sloppy track home: billeted in the barracks again: issued with a blanket each &amp; it is very acceptable:</p>

<p>Saturday Sept 16th <br/>Ypres: fair day: had a look round the station &amp; town again: looked through a convent: the altar in the chapel was a beauty: got a "P" of it: a fair bit of gun fire on during the last few nights: got a bosker parcel of cakes from J.B.J.</p>
