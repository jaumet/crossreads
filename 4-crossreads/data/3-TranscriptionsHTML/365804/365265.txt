<p>France 8.9.16</p>
<p>My dear Judge<br/>I have just received your letter dated 8th July. I am relieved to know that Mrs Ferguson and yourself are better than I had feared might be the case. I have been thinking of you both a great deal ever since the day when the Padre (Holliday) told me that Arthur had been killed. Poor dear old Arthur, He was the only chap with whom I have been really intimate since I left school. It was a terrible knock to me to hear that he had finished his job.</p>
<p>It does me good indeed to feel that I am dear to you both. I realise what our personal interest in me has meant during the last couple of years commencing at a time when things were far from bright. I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to write to you lately. There is always the one subject in my mind when I start and it is hard to write of anything else. I am writing to Keith<br/>Tonight. Fondest love to Mrs Ferguson and Dorothy<br/>Affectionaly yours<br/>C.R.Lucas</p>
