Bulford5/12/17Dear Mum,It is now Wednesday & I am only answering Your letters now.  Ellis has gone to Salisbury & I am on Duty.  But My fatigue Party are cutting up the Suet for X'mas pudding & I have not to stand over them.  I'll go & see whether it is finished & that's all I have to do.  I've pulled the Big arm chair up to the Fire & now I'll try & answer a lot of My letters.  I received 20 odd last week.  I am so glad that Cyril has been out to see You.  We had a bonny day in London to-gether.  I have written a couple of letters lately to Mrs Stephen.  I reckon Her as one of my Best of Friends.  I received Your X'mas parcel O.K. to-day.  Everything is choice & good.  The parcel was a bit battered & the nuts & the sugar were a bit mixed but I soon sorted that out.  I am sorry to hear about poor old Mrs Bowden.  I did not know anything about it.  I am not playing Lacrosse or Football over here.  I am taking on Hockey this year.  It is a nice gentle game & we have a lovely ground right alongside the Hospital.  Ellis may play too.We don't worry if the mail is late.  We are lucky to get any letters the way things are going.I've been called away on another Job since I wrote the above.  I have had a shave & cleaned my Boots in the meantime as well.  It is a bit too cold to shave in the morning.  One can do it alright but "it is nice to get up in the mornin', but it's nicer to stay in bed"   I can have one extra 1/4 of an Hour
