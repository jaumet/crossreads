 1917 APRIL 
 18 WEDNESDAY 
 Snowing in morning &amp; 
 raining the rest of the day. We 
 left Longuenesse at 10 AM 
 &amp; after passing through 
 &quot;Lumbres&quot; we arrived at 
 Quesques [(Kirk)?] about 7 pm 
 &amp; camped in a barn again 
 The country has altered 
 a lot here, has a lot of hills 
 &amp; is not very thickly populated 
 You cannot buy things 
 either like you can near 
 the line.
