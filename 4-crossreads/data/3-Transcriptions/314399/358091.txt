<p>Friday 4 April 1919<br/>Lovely day again. We seem to be getting our issue. Met Harry Thomas this morning. Steve Flew couldn't go to Rouen so after a lot of persuasion I went in his place. Was on duty in the afternoon but filled the report in. Also one for tomorrow night. Some scream this show. Left Havre at 5.10 pm in the Paris express &amp; reached Rouen at 6.50 pm. Went to the club but they didn't keep beds so went around to the Hotel D'Angliterre &amp; got set. Was still quite light so we wandered around &amp; just picked up our bearings</p>
<p>Saturday 5 April 1919<br/>Up at 8 am &amp; round to the club for brekker. Visited the cathedral &amp; climbed the tower. Took a few snaps. The town was very misty. The cathedral is beautiful both inside &amp; outside. Real old gothic. visited Hotel du Ville, Church at St Ouen, Palais de Justice. Gros Horloge. My description of these things will have to be put on the photos I've taken if they turn out OK. After lunch at the club we went out to Bousicoin &amp; saw Joan d'Arc's monument. Got an excellent view of the town from here, also a good view of the Seine. It is very picturesque. Visited the Hotel Bourgtheoillde. Only saw the outside which has plenty of carvings. Visited the place where Joan d'Arc was burned. Also the Tower Joan d'Arc the place where she was imprisoned. This town is all that is left of a huge Chateau (called Chateau de Rouen). Met French at the club &amp; and had dinner with him. Ordered a drink &amp; 2 oranges at the hotel. Got them but found the oranges cost 2 F each. Sent them back.</p>
