VStrange you should have run across old Emme.  He was a great old chap. I lost track of him after the breaking up of the 1st Div that time in Egypt.  In fact I see very few of my old men now.  Toomey is OK. tho' I havn't seen him for months.  Have run across a bit of a relative in my Brigade - namely one Bourke - He has been Adjutant since Iv'e been in the Brigade but I only discovered a few days ago that his Brother married Daisy
