<p>28 June 1915</p>
<p>The temperature with the atmospheric conditions here are becoming oppressive in this part of the world, but we shall pull through right I hope.</p>
<p>My command at this hospital is running much better than I could have hoped for.   General Maxwell, since his visit, has been talking, to other senior officers, in very laudatory terms of my management.  Surgeon General Ford was telling me about it last night, &amp; as it is he who asked me to take on the work, he too was well pleased, when he desired that I should take the work, he remarked that it was the most difficult task in Egypt.   Good.  I met Col. Martin at a dinner given by Col. Barrett last evening but I did not speak to him, I dodged even the saluting of him.  He is not worth bothering about any further than to protect oneself against his stupid acts.</p>
<p>Good bye my dears, "let all the ends though aim'st at be thy country's, Thy God's, and truth's.   Be just and fear not."   May heaven give each of you many, many happy days; while "The friends thou hast and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy souls with hoops of steel.".   Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on all of you.</p>
