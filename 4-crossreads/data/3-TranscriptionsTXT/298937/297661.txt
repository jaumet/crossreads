fell in to march out.Embarked after about 7 miles march, on the "King Edward", a small Channel boat.Some wounded Tommies & Australians on the wharf.  They say that a man does not last long on the Somme without getting wounded.Slept as best I could on deck & in the early hours got up to see the lights of the Guard ships outside Portsmouth.  As the light got better we slowly steamed up the Solent & passing Netley Hospital & finally berthed in Southampton Docks.
