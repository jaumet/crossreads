<p>1917 Tuesday 31 July</p>
<p>On duty all day. Weather still unsettled &amp; frequently raining. The big push up north between Ypres &amp; the sea is being interfered with. Wounded bring reports of hideous shelling of unequalled fierceness each succeeding stunt gets more diabolical. Gassed cases are many. This continuous rain adds to the beastliness of it all. <br/>Wall's birthday. <br/>No mail yet.</p>
