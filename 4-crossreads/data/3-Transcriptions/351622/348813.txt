<p>18 April 1916 Tues<br/>Raining very hard &amp; awfully cold a typical winters day in Flanders. The town crier comes round reading orders. Tucker is getting awful. Soldiers everywhere. Heavy artillery pass through. I wonder with all the men we have can anything be done in the coming Great Offensive.</p>
<p>19 April 1916 Wed<br/>Never even had [indecipherable] to get a cup of coffee this morning with Marsh. Things are pretty stiff. Slept nearly all day. Awfully cold night again &amp; very black outside. Every few minutes the sky is lit up like day by the German star shells as they burst</p>
