18/3/19
Marcinelle
The usual morning round except that I met little Les and inspected all his Lewis guns. An impressive sight this morning was the funeral of a Belgian soldier killed in 1914 whose exhumed body was now being buried. First came our firing party with arms reversed followed by band playing Dead March in Saul and then altarboys crucifix and priests. The coffin was carried by Belgian soldiers and the came relatives and spectators. Church bell tolling all the time. After went up the town to try and learn dancing and made rough weather of a waltz. From there went to the Berlitz school and put in an hour with a detestable Belgian chap who teaches there. We mess nowadays at 5.30 which seems early and 7 pm finds it still light. Went and teased Little Les.
