 6 April, 1916 Selhai [Salhia] It was a day of fixing up to day, we got our lines tidied &amp; levelled off &amp; now everything looks spick &amp; span, our tent also is more comfortable we scraped off all the loose sand &amp; damped it.  The tucker is a bit light bully &amp; a little bread it will be alright to morrow though, I expect.  Its far more comfortable in the mess sheds though, we have a shed to each squadron so there are four decent sized tables to each troop &amp; that is not too bad.  There is a good deal of bother about the gear on the lines, A squadron declares that B &amp; C are pinching all its stuff while B swears that A &amp; C have got down on it for its own &ndash; then C is complaining that B &amp; A are at its gear so that things are sort of a bit mixed &ndash; We are all wondering what is next.  Many rumours are afloat, one being that all the Mounted Div is to come down here.  There is a big mail in I believe, hope its true.
