 My dearest Father, I was very sorry to hear of the loss of the title-deeds.  I know absolutely nothing about them, &amp; in fact, I have never seen them at any time.  I do hope they are only mislaid, for their loss is very serious. We are still busy sowing &amp; have just on 160 acres in now.  It has been showery this afternoon so we couldn't do much. The grass is shooting now &amp; looks beautiful &amp; green now. Try &amp; persuade Walter to come up.  I have written to him about it &amp; both Mr &amp; Mrs Pearce would be very pleased to have him &amp; the change would do him good. There is very little news.  We are all well except one of the boys who has a bit of a cold. I am ashamed of this short scribble, but there is nothing to report, so will close, Love to all at home, Your loving son, Leo.
