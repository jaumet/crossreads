<p>18:  Since July 20th we have been saddling up &amp; standing to arms at 3 a.m. each morning when in camp &amp; the men seem to be worn out; the "hats" sending our Bdge to Tel el Makeab at noon today for a well earned rest.</p>
<p>23:  After much cleaning of gear, Gen. Chaytor inspected us this morning; irons &amp; bits polished for the occasion; been working on our gear for the last four days &amp; scarcely have a moment to ourselves, so we are enjoying the "spell".  Good camp &amp; fearful rations, these having been reduced 5 per cent as we are not in the firing line.</p>
<p>25:  Cholera &amp; T.A.B. inoculations to day, one in either arm.  Lost 7 men to hospital leaving us with four horses to look after.</p>

<p>4:  Brigade boxing tournament, good nights fun; Bdr. Cox &amp; Ryrie entering ring &amp; challenging one another, but the boys could not induce them to don the gloves.</p>
<p>10:  Another inspection by red tabbed artists, Gen. Chauvel inspected; being counted out by the New Zealanders, who had to polish up for the occasion &amp; got fed up with the stunt.  Chauvel is in command of the Desert mounted column.</p>
