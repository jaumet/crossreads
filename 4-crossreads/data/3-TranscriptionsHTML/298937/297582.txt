<p>responsible for my meeting Mrs. Nyland, has also lost a brother.<br/>Yesterday what I have been waiting for for so long arrived.<br/>Dr. Cockinos brought letter No. 3 from Rita &amp; the photograph.  How eagerly have I been expecting the photograph.<br/>It is a splendid one &amp; I like it immensely, but it is not perfect.  It does not show her at her very best which is how I would naturally like it, but then what photograph could.  A photograph is at the best only a help to memory.<br/>It shows the person in one mood or position &amp; leaves the mind to conjure up the hundreds</p>
