<p>get about and see things. Ted &amp; Sis are going to have a weekend there when I am fit. It is unfortunate that the Season is so far advanced as the trees are mostly bare now, and give the country &amp; Parks a very dreary appearance &ndash;</p>
<p>Sis &amp; Ted are wonderfully well and also Miss Mackenzie. Mum's letter of Octr 17th was delivered here on Friday but none have been sent on</p>
