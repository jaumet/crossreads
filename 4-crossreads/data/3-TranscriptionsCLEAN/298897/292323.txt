The buildings used, at one time were dye works & are well adapted for the purpose.  The idea is splendid, the men having a chance to keep clean and comfortable & it saves them from the trouble of washing their own clothes which is quite a problem in this moist climate.  The laundry girls are rather a rough lot, speaking English a little from contact with our men & having the usual slang etc off by heart.  At night had a champagne party for our last night. 
 Thursday 13th July As B Section had taken over there was nothing to do bar load our waggons & shew them round  We moved off about 2 oclock the bearers going to the bathing establishment & the tent division to "L'Estrade" where A section were running a divisional rest camp.  It turned out to be a splendid show everything being nicely arranged good food, men very comfortable & all happy.  Work was plentiful so that from all accounts we will earn our money for a time at least.
