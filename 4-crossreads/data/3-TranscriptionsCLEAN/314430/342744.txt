  
 August 23rd:- Heard today that we are going to Liverpool. The sea in this part is said to be infested with German submarines, but we have not seen a periscope. Eight torpedo boat destroyers are cruising round the convoy.  The  Sea is very rough. 
 August 26th:- Up at 4  am  o'clock this morning. Entered the Mersey at 8 a.m. We disembarked at the Liverpool Dock Railway Station, at 10. a m, and entrained for Salisbury Plainat 11 a.m. Before leaving the docks, I had a last look at the  old  trusty Transports which had borne us  so bravely  safely through the perils of three oceans. The voyage from Melbourne lasted 66 days.
