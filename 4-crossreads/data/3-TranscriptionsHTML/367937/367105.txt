<p>Lyttleton<br/>Orlando Av.<br/>Mosman<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>My dear Mother<br/>You will see by the above address that I am still here.<br/>When I went to Dr Mason on Thursday he sounded me well and said yes I was just all right, but it would have been better if I could have had a few days longer but I said I did not want to stay in Sydney and would rather go to camp.  He said All right.<br/>However on Friday morning it was raining hard so I rang him up and he said it would be most unwise to go to camp and chance getting flooded out at the start and not to go till Monday so here I are.<br/>On Thursday afternoon Aunt Katie and I went into town; I bought a pair of boots, but not at Thomas' place so had to pay cash for em.<br/>Also had my photo taken at Swis Studios, I am sure I look rotton because I felt cross and tired.<br/>On Friday I saw Cousin Annie</p>
