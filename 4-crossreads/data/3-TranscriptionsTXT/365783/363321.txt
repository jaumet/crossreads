Was delighted to get a batch of letters at 10 this evening, amongst them five from your own dearself including those addressed to Melbourne Adelaide &amp; Fremantle.   I was pleased to hear that there was no cause for the scare that worried you &ndash; I was a bit nonplussed how to advise you in the matter &ndash; but your next letter telling me that all was well was a great relief.  If you get  troubled  worried like that again while I am away you had better see a doctor.   Poor old Mrs. &ndash; 'magination of course.   Thanks very much for the letter telling me all about the garden.  I was delighted to hear that you were all so well.
