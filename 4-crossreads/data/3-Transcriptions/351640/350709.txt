<p>be of a severe kind and that many thousands of wounded men will before long be brought to Egypt for treatment, if so it is quite possible that No 2 G.H. will be stuck in this spot for many months, up till today I did not think this to be possible or likely, but in the game we are at one never can tell what will happen next.  It may be that I shall not be here, as I told General Williams tonight that if he gave me a change elsewhere that I should take it.  I hope it will come soon because I desire to get away from the hopeless crowd that is here, &amp; as he said it would be an advantage for me to be my own Chief.  I hope.  Those in power here may be all right for themselves and others, they are not particular enough, in heaps of ways, for my tastes, not that I am as correct as I should be, yet do I try to act in the way that is best, &amp; I hope that my limitations do not keep me at too low a plane.</p>
<p>When Buckingham told Henry VI that Jack Cade had fled, he said:&ndash;<br/>"Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,<br/>To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!"<br/>So shall I when orders come for me to take up some new position.  Perhaps in setting out my ideas of what is correct in the performing of duty and in behaviour mongst men, were set at too high a standard, they were based on my experience as a combatant officer amongst men who had not the training of medical men, yet these were as far as my association with them went, nearly always prepared to be courteous, punctual, correct in dress, clean of words, studious, truthful, self respecting, and clean of mirth.  It was a pleasure to be of them, to associate with them, and talk with them.  Here I often sit at table and say not a word during a meal because the talk is of such class that it has no interest for me by reason of its childishness or its uncleanness.</p>
