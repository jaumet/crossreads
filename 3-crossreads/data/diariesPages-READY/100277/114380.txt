I had another very narrow escape, in fact got knocked flying head over heel's, it lobbed about 3 yards from me on the side of the trench a few men were hit a few seriously
Got issued with our sheepskin vests tonight they came at a very opportune time for the nights are very very cold.
Heavy artillery duels all the afternoon our guns have been powering away like mad. Have been pretty crook ever since the concussion from the shell, she shook me up pretty badly made me real sick a crook headache
4th. By Jove I was crook last night for several hour's a sort of colicky pains used to run through my stomach nearly double me up I think it must have been the effects of the concussion, or the water from the shell craters this is the only water we have to drink, I think there is something left in the crater from the explosion of the shell.
