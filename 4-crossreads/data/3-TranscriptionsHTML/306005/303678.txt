<p>31-12-16<br/>is 12 miles from Rafa which is reported to be occupied by 3 Btn of Infantry, 1 battery of Artillery &amp; 1 Regt of Cavalry. It was showery all last night &amp; cloudy this morning but no rain &amp; had a decent trip home to El Arish arriving here 3.30; After having a snack I rode over to B.H.Q. &amp; saw[x1] Capt Hudson (Bde Capt) in reference to my application for leave which was returned to me this morning saying I could only be granted 3 days, I can get leave but am leaving it stand till Lieut Kater returns the day after tomorrow from Port Said; Laid another line back to the Regt as we have been having trouble with the old one. Had enough cake to last us through the trip as I got 4 parcels on the 29th</p>
