<p>improvised nosebags out of chaff bags and so peace reigns once more. But when morning comes I shall waylay them when they come to the feed stack Then I will have revenge  I know they will only "pinch" them again at the first opportunity but such is the way things go here it all helps to make the spice of life.</p>
<p>3rd March   Friday 1916.</p>
<p>Went for a ride to Nazlet-El-Abid this morning took some message forms to the Signallers. I have filled in the forms for that Commission this morning and they have been handed in must await results now. I am not particularly anxious If I do get it it will mean cutting away from old associates and going amongst strangers. When the early morning patrol was going out about 5 AM this morning one of the men Pte Leatch had the misfortune to fall over the bridge which spans the canal close to Camp and was drowned. Up to a late hour tonight no trace of him has been found. although<br/>someone dived and brought his rifle to the surface. There is a very strong current at this place and it is surmised that his body has by this time gone some considerable distance down stream<br/>"C" Squadron are still awaiting orders.</p>
