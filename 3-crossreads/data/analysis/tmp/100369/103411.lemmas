 Gall Face Hotel . A beauti drive this . Littl children run after the rickshaw with flower from Buddha 's templ , and beg penni Had our photo taken in rickshaw , then rode back . An hour away 8d each . Beauti Cocoanut Palm tower abov all other foliag especi visibl these from the ship on the left of the harbour . Went through the nativ quarter , both in the rickshaw , and walk . Veri hot and the heat seem to bring to perfect matur all the vile smell abound in this quarter . Dirt and filth about everywher . Nativ , dozen of them in veri confin quarter . Old fellow in fruit stall with their feet up among their ware get down and solemn salaam say "veri good fruit master vera clean and nice " We did not buy Saw old women bent and grey , onli shadow of womanhood , out in the boil sun , break stone , for the road , carri them , and make the road . Look cruel and has a smack of slaveri about it that doe n't leav a nice tast in a British mouth . Women in these part seem to have a veri hard life in spite of the benefit of British rule . Will it ever be differ ? One wonder and think of Kipl 's line
