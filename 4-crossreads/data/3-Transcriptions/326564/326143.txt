<p>in the big Hall on Map reading, &amp; Prismatic Compass.</p>
<p>20th. Paraded with our overcoats on this morning for it was raining lightly &amp; everything very sloppy &amp; wet. We went out to the live practicing ground &amp; the officer in charge gave a demonstration of the various flares rockets signals &amp; smoke bombs etc, it was most interesting though the smoke &amp; fumes were almost choking at times.<br/>After this was finished we fired bombs till 12 oclock &amp; then home for dinner, the next item on the programme was one of the funniest things you ever saw, the whole school had to take part in a 4 mile cross-country race, a lot of the chaps took their tunics putties &amp; some took their shirts off</p>
