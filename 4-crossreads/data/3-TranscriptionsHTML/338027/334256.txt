<p>Friday, 15 October, 1915<br/>Issued with canteen stores to-day, we order them and a representative goes to Imbros and buys them at the canteen and the amount is charged up in our pay books.  We buy mostly tinned stuffs &amp; preserves.  There was a big demonstration last night on at 4 a.m. in the morning extending from the right to the left along the whole front.  These demonstrations are done to attract the Turks attention when a few brigades of Austs start cooeeing &amp; yelling like mad the Turks think we are charging &amp; move their trenches this prevents them rushing reinforcements to the real attack.  Every one had to stand to arms but I was back between the blankets as soon as it was over.  The monitors bombarded furiously.</p>
<p>Saturday, 16 October, 1915<br/>The last page of my beloved little diary, you have been my constant companion &amp; solace day by day for twelve long months and now you terminate, I rec a parcel to-day containing books etc but the expected diary for next year was not in it. How ever I am going right on with my diary as I realize what it will be in years to come.</p>
<p>Sick parade getting bigger 57 paraded to-day, but mostly dressings it was 11.30 before we finished.  Further good news from France and as I now close my book for 1914-1915 my earnest wish is that the next date next year will not see me still writing, to-day I wrote a poem to my friends mother and a copy is in the back of this book.</p>
