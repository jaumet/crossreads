<p>I don't care now how soon I get back to France now Len has gone, for theres nothing much of interest to me round here now.<br/>On our way home Lindsay &amp; I picked up Bill Graham &amp; the 3 of us went in to the 1st T.B. looking for Digby who had just returned from his 6 months leave in Australia, we found him &amp; he told us all about his experiences reckons they had a rotten time for the first 6 weeks no one would recognise them, but after they were found out they had a glorious holiday, I am jolly glad I did not get away now for we have our leave in front &amp; things will be in running order when we get to Aussie so there will be no delay it was the same when first I came to England on the Cadre last year</p>
