<p>Tuesday March 4<br/>The sea is like a sheet of glass. I got up about 5.30 this morning, had a bath, then sat on deck &amp; watched the sun rise. It was glorious. The flying fish as they jumped out of the water looked very pretty in the dazzling sunlight. The sick I made this morning was the biggest we have had since leaving Plymouth. Quite a number of the Diggers are knocked out by the Heat. It has been a fearfully hot day. Tomorrow we cross the Line. &amp; there is a Carnival coming off to celebrate the event. There is to be a Fancy Dress &amp; Prizes are offered for the best Costumes.<br/>Wed Mar. 5<br/>During the early hours of the morning I felt mighty uncomfortable, so I hopped out on deck &amp; strolled about for a while. Le [indecipherable] came to [indecipherable] about 1 p.m. &amp; informed us that one of the patients died during the night. It gave me quite a shock, as the chap (Cotmore) went ashore at Colombo, amp; seemed quite well; but he had a serious relapse of malaria. This is out first death aboard. He was buried at sunrise this morning. The Diggers are going very sore because "Last Post" wasn't sounded. Tonight there is a Carnival on to celebrate the occasion of crossing the Line; which we did at 2 p.m. Yank has gone as an Arab, &amp; Kirkbride as a Sister. Postle went as a Jew. They all looked very well.</p>
