On arrival at Altdamn the party was taken to an obsolete railway carriage, occupied by six Russians who were, apparently, appointed to assist the wounded. We remained in the carriage for several hours. A Hun under-officer, accompanied by a Russian N.C.O., entered and ordered us to walk to the camp, an order which I refused to obey. The Hun "Donnerwettered and stormed at me vociferously for some time, and realizing the futility of his absurd order he then told me to wait until a vehicle arrived. Altdamm is a large manufacturing town, but most of the works are closed. The local resources are exhausted. The car arrived and I scrambled into it and commenced my journey to Altdamm Laager. The roads were mostly frozen. We travelled through the outskirts of the town until we passed over a sand hill and came upon the camp.

I sat on my bunk, with a filthy Russian on either side and tried to settle down, but the repulsive smell almost overcame me. Despite the cold, I hopped outside, and sat in the frozen mud bemoaning my miserable situation. My only plan was to return and endeavour to make myself as comfortable as possible, which I did, after meditating for nearly two hours. Fortunately I still
