of shell holes and the trees had been stripped of their branches. Ammunition of all descriptions were lying scattered about. A few stranded Tanks could be seen lying in the fields as if they had stuck there. As it was daylight when we were travelling between Albert and Bray we could see the country very well and it was nothing but desolation all the way. Not a sound was to be heard nothing but bare fields and destruction everywhere. It is about three weeks since Fritz was in this district but now he is at least thirty miles away and he is going back as fast as his legs can carry him.
The Village of Bray was in ruins and deserted but for a few soldiers billetted in some of the tumble down houses Fritz had been driven out of it by the 3rd Batt A.I.F. The Church of the Village was destroyed. It had been used as a Dressing Station by Fritz I was told a story regarding this church but whether it is true or not I cannot vouch for it.
This church had the Huge Red Cross painted on the roof ( of the chu). A Fritz machine gun crew took up position on the top of the steeple of the church
