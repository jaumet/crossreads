 Saturday March 17. 1917 Bright sun shine this morning.  There are some of Fritz's aeroplanes about this morning, our guns fired upon them, and a piece of the shrapnel went through the roof of No 4 ward, but no one was hit. About this time last year when I was in camp at Seymour, my sister Marther died in the Hamilton Hospital.  It was on a Saturday &amp; I think the date was 18th. To day is St.Patrick's day. After dinner I went for a walk to Sternwerck with another patient.  It is about half a mile away.  My foot stood the walking all right, though it was sore at the start.  While there I got my hair cut by a french barber for 3d.  They are very good at their work and the saloon was full.  Shaving is 1&frac12; d.  I also bought a note book at 7d. a much larger one than this. The principal news in the papers today is the revolution in Russia.  The Dumna and the people supported by the army have taken possession, imprisoned the cabinet for being incompetent, and the czar has abdicated the throne.
