they were to wire him a 48 hours extension which they did this morning, now word had just come through to say that the draft would be leaving tomorrow at 3 P.M. they could not get a wire through in time for him to be down, so they asked me for advice, at last I hit on the way out, my plan was this for Chunder to go to the Orderly Room get the Sgt to make out a form then get an officer to sign it make it an urgent priority telegram On His Majestys Service, that's the only way we could get a wire through for the offices are all shut to the public after 7 P.M, we got this done then I took it as quick as I could down to Sutton Veney P. office the officer in charge reckons he won't get it before 9.30 in
