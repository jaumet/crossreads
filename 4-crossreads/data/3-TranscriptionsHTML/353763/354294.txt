<p>I went for a 7 mile walk on Saty  aft  -  Took my vasculum &amp; with one mate &ndash; Harrison &ndash; walked right round the environs of Suva  -  This keeps me fit &amp; well &amp; in addition I exercise my powers of observation which enables me to collect any new plants I come across  -  Our route lay to the Rewa river- over a bridge &amp; round by a different road home  -  Happy Fijians &ndash; some Filipinos &amp; lots of sad looking Hindus passed us  -  Funny why the Hindus look so depressed  -  Their women don't  -  Some Hindoo women look shy &amp; refined &amp; even pretty  -  The kids are lively enough  -  Everyone here kills the introduced mongoose &ndash; ricky ticky tavy &ndash; with his furry tail  -  I saw one wiped out &ndash; probably he was after chickens  -  I didn't get much that was new to me  -  The two commonest flowers were Lantana &amp; black eyed Susan (a Thumbergia)  -  The only thing I didn't know was a fine white star shaped flower</p>
