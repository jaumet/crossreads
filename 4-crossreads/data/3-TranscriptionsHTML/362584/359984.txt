She was so pleased I could tell her such a lot about him, &amp; has offered to put me up whenever I go to London. She is a fine old lady, &amp; entertains Australian officers regardless of expenses. Her house is open to them all, at all times, &amp; whenever you call you are almost certain to meet somebody you know.</p>

<p>So cheer up!</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
