Jue 3rd  We worked on the bus all day. Jno & I went down for a swim at noon. I had a letter from Marion in which she mentioned the Etaples bomming incident when Fritz bombed the hospitals there heavily, killing nurses & patients etc. Marion was sent to another unit  in England a few days before the incident. No 1 Canadian Gen (her late unit) was one which suffered a number of casualties.
