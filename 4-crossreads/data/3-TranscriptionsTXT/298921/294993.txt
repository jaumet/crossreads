January, 1915Wednesday 20This Convoy apart from the troops & horses is loaded with valuable Cargo for London - thousands of carcases of sheep, wool, Ores, etc. so Germany would have secured a good haul had she been able to catch us. Have been reading about German atrocities which for a civilized nation are appalling.The White Star boats - [indecipherable] & Versic which left us to Coal at Aden should be waiting for us there.
