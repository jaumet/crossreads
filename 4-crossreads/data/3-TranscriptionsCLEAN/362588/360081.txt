  
 No. 111 
 The Honorable Mr Justice Ferguson Judges Chambers Supreme Court Sydney New South Wales Australia 
 Just informed mail closes tomorrow and as it is late & am very tired shall leave letter till next mail.  Rumoured today that A.G.F. is at Suez.  If so be here in about 2 days.  This is a bad place.  The sand is dust & the heat has been pretty bad.  The name of this place is Heliopolis & is about 10 miles from Cairo.  We had leave to Cairo yesterday, went to pyramids & had a fine time.  No idea when we move out.  We are very comfortable in big square tents. 
 Best love to all, Yours ever C.R.L. [C.R. Lucas] 20-6-15
