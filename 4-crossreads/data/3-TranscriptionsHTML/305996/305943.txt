<p>Monday 19th or 20th April 15. Am still at Lemnos. Rumours constantly getting around that we are moving. It seems <strike>the</strike> now that we are going to-morrow night. Have made the awful discovery that I am "chatty". Got a most awful shock I had attributed an itch I had noticed for some time past to a rash but I have now found that the rash is in the first place due to those vile "hexapods"  known as lice. The first one I discovered gave me no little trouble. On routing him out he sprang to the floor and raced for cover. I followed in hot pursuit over forms under tables through hammock bins, etc. Once he doubled under me and I tripped over him. Presently half the company was after him. In desperation he charged up the companion way to the next deck. Here he created a panic amongst the horses and the battalion Mascots joined in the hunt. Finally with palpitating sides &amp; gleaming teeth he bailed up in a corner. I approached warily with a 2 x 3 plank and with Some little trouble despatched him. He was judged the finest specimen found at our table.</p>
