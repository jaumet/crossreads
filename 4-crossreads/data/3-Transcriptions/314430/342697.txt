<p>Town Hall, but only women and children showed a feeble tendency to welcome us. One house displayed an Australian flag, which caused the boys to cheer their own National Banner &ndash; when nobody else would. Reports of the Troops's misbehaviour in Cape Town were sedulously disseminated in Durban, reports most slanderous and most detrimental to the good name of Australian Soldiers. I frequently heard a very gross charge* made against some Australians (by a man in the city Fruit markets, (and by numerous other citizens. <strike>)</strike> Many of us felt wildly indignant about it. Some days before we arrived at Durban, a copy of verses+ was circulated on the ship; apparently these verses were composed to vindicate our character. They were "written by a South African lady after hearing a wealthy merchant speak disparagingly of Australians". The following is a characteristic stanza: -</p>
<p>"O God could we show these misers<br/>The path that the Anzacs went!<br/>Could they rest in their beds at night time?<br/>Or live in their damned Content?<br/>Could they talk with a sneer of Australians<br/>When one or two get drunk?<br/>I'd rather a drunk Australian<br/>Than a wealthy Durban funk,"</p>
<p>[Footnotes]<br/>* It is better to leave my note of this matter untranscribed.<br/>+ There verses are published in no 4 issue of "The Hevic" &ndash; title, "Australians".</p>
