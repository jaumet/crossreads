<p>played a few good selections up on deck, &amp; after that a lot of us joined in &amp; had a dance it was very good we kept it up till 9 pm when the bugal sounded for lights to go out so we went down for our hammocks &amp; brought them up to sleep on deck as it was very hot.  We had just got nicely settled when a very heavy shower of rain came on, you never saw such a devil of a scatter in all your life as the hatch is not very large &amp; it put me in mind of about 50 rabbits all trying to get into the same hole at once.  Anyhow those who did not get down were shoved or pushed down &amp; by the time all the pushing was over the rain had stopped.  Well this morning we were all pleased to see a bit of land once more, <strike>us</strike> the first we have seen since we left Australia.  It is the south coast of "Ceylon".  We expect to reach "Colombo" about midday. Well we arrived at 2.30 pm &amp; anchored &amp; were well protected by Gun boats.  There is a large Russian Cruiser not very far from us at present.  "Colombo" from the distance is a very gay looking place.  We can see the principal Hotels in the distance they are surrounded by Lawns &amp; trees which gives the place a very actracting apperance.</p>
