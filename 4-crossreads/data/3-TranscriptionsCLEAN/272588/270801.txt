Thursday 14 NovemberAt Busigny enjoying glorious weather & not much work. A big Aust. mail in to-day.
Friday 15 NovemberStill at Bussigny. We are liable to move at any time to the Frontier, but I think that we will have to go on foot. We are having glorious weather & the moonlit nights are no longer feared for fear of visits of enemy 'planes. We saw a very fine show to-night, the "Pedlars" & it is the best we have seen in France.
