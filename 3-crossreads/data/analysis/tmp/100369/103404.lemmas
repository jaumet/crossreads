 4 The ghost of prayer and cri and tear The Ghost of Good deed done Pass and Shudder , glide by Solemn , one by one Silent , one by one 5 Ghost of Faith and Hope and Truth , Memori brought from the Womb Of byegon day , ( what a host there are ) Pass again to the Tomb The still and Desol Tomb 6 Ah me , they are onli Ghost to day , But the Sin that slew them is here Lusti and strong , astraddl the tomb Grave Of the past I held so dear The Past with it memori dear . 7 They pass , and a lone road of pain As I bow my head , I see For the tender Joy of a nobler past Will never come back to me . No, never return to me . LM Mocasar 12-4-17
