look around. I put in a fair amount of time in London, where among others I met the Hughes, Maurice being bed with a blighty which is going to leave one foot permanently shorter than another. Geoff is still on his instructional job in England but is likely to come over here shortly to obtain his majority. Then I had six glorious days up in Scotland, three in Edinburgh, three out in the country north of Perth. Coming back to London I wangled five extra days, making a total of nineteen. The next thing in view is leave to Paris for eight days probably next month. The young bro is now a lance jack in the 20th BN but I hope soon to have him through to an O.T.C. Stalkey is back again after his second blighty, Busby, Puss in boots Bain, Len Robson, Ned Raine, Dicky Francis, John Flynn, Walter Mac (now our Bde major), Peter Braddon (on a cushy job) are all over here now & going strong. Well my son please give kindest regards to all your people & hoping to hear of you soon, with all best wishes. Yours while the rum ration lasts Ginger Allan
