<p>Aug 13 Rudely awakened at sunrise by a man with a formidable looking hose, who wanted to swab the deck. Not being a lover of impromtu showers I decamped &amp; put me on a pair of khaki sox. On ordinary days I go sox-less, but today is as you know, Sunday, &amp; one must hie himself to Church. I regret to state that during the greater part of the Sermon I slumbered. You see the ships pumps were discharging much water into the Atlantic &ndash; the noise whereof did drown most effectively the voice of the Parson.
