Sunday. A much finer and milder day. There was a voluntary church service held by Padre Blood at the HQ billet and at 11 I held a conference of 
OCs QSM & IO at the mess and discussed matters regarding future shifts. After lunch took the Keithlet for a ride through Avesnes out on to the main road which we have to take on Tuesday. This country is remarkably like Somerset and from one place just before entering Avesnes there is a fine glimpse of gentle undulating old world scenery. Through Avesnes – quite a good town with several old world buildings and twisting cobbled streets. Rode home in time to see a thrilling football match between A Coy & B. Pay night tonight. Spent part of the evening watching Pat Gorman writing his history which is now completed up to Ville-sur-Ancre.
