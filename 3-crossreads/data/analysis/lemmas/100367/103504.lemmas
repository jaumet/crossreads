 Friend and relat line the street on either side , or walk along with the men to the station . They are soon at the station , and the entrain is the work of a few minut . Immediat the window are up , and then block with the lad who are eager to wave their "goodby " from ani vantag point . All aboard ? the green flag is wave , and they re off . The train move swift ? so must this narrat , or the boy will not be there befor the war end . On detrain , the boy line up and march to the steamer . On the wharf their embark card are hand to them , and certain order as to the space allot to each unit is made known . In proper order they march up the gangway , hand in their embark card , and go aboard . After the allot of mess is complet , the men quick divest themselv of their kit and equip , and make for the deck . By this time the wharf is crowd with relat and friend . Color streamer are thrown aboard , fruit , and other littl articl are pass up , last farewel are spoken , and eager face watch while the gangway and moor line are lift . Slowli the big vessel move away , and one by one the streamer break at the strain , and the last tie to dear one and friend is sever . Down the bay she sail , and the boy watch from the deck and the rig at the fast reced shore , until it is lost to their vision . With a sigh they make for the troop deck , and their attent is then given to make themselv comfort . While thus engag , " Cookhous " sound , and the first meal aboard ( which is invari Tea ) is partaken of . It is a strang gather , and everyth appear strang . Tea over , the boy again take to the deck , but there is littl time to spare , as hammock and blanket have to be distribut and a select of sleep "possi " to be made . The hammock are soon in posit on the hook , and as the boy have had some late night dure the last week ashor , they are not long ere they are " Rock in the cradl of the deep " to a peac slumber . To look at the hammock as they hang in row to the hook in the roof , would remind one of frozen mutton hang in a refriger chamber . But they are the boy at rest , dream of home and love one , and this is their first night at sea . First day at sea . The throb of the engin has awaken mani of the boy earli this morn . Reveill sound at 6 a.m. but thing today are somewhat mix . On awak it was imposs to understand for the moment where they were , or what had happen , but the roll of the ship soon reveal to them that they are at sea , and this is their first morn on the brini . They hop out , roll blanket and hammock , dress , and make for the troop deck as soon as they can . The steamer roll and pitch , and land is nowher in sight . Here and there some of the boy feel unwel , and in a veri short time a few will be found lean on the ship 's rail look dismal at the white foam . Other are sit around with a look of utter despair on their face . Then an unfamiliar sound from our " cobbo " at the rail tell us that he is lose last night 's tea . Other join in and it is not long befor mani tea are lost forev . Seasick has becom an epidem . Bugl call are ignor , meal are left untouch , men lay around as it were after a charg . It is a broken armi for the time be , but ere long it will awak to new life and vigor . Onli those who have surviv the maladi , move around and look after their unfortun comrad , thus prove their true comradeship . The " First post " is sound , and the hammock are again swing on the hook , with their precious freight . Befor " Last Post " and " Light out " are sound , the boy are again in dreamland , and their first day at sea end . Perhap mani time befor " Reveill " sound on the morn of the second day , some of the men have been up at the rail again . Whether that is the case or not , they make the effort to get up and out of the stuffi mess deck to fresh air abov . The epidem of seasick is still rampant , consequ the day pass in a somewhat similar manner to it predecessor . But can one wonder at it , when the old ship swing to and fro on the roll billow of the Australian Bight .
