 KHAN YUNUS Enemy "Plane" over as usual but no bombs. The BENDUCK cakes etc. are now being enjoyed with JIM AYRE who is back fit &amp; well. In fact the men look more like NIGGERS than our own folk they are so brown. I shall cable if I get any leave at once. I found my Horses fit &amp; well &amp; all my KIT as I left it. 
 It is a treat to be on the SAND again &amp; not DUST. My application for 6 wks. leave to England has passed Brigade, but I can hardly believe my luck if it is granted. I will cable you at once.
