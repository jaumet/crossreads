 Friday 13 October 1916 Dull with several drizzles of rain which were hardly heavy enough to wet one but which made the cobble roads very slippery. After breakfast went by car to visit 2 English Divisional Gas Officers (55th &amp; 38th Divs.) &amp; very much enjoyed the run round. In the afternoon walked down to the Oxelaere school with Cart. Barley, going by a new route thro' beautiful park lands, very steep, but very pretty. Left Cassel by car about 5 o'c. &amp; reported to the 1st Aust. Div. being sent by them to Busseboom to await the Bde. H.Q. which was to come out that night. Found that Rid's Art. Bde. was camped close by &amp; went up &amp; spent a couple of hours with him. It was great to see him again. Forgot to mention that I called in to see Leo on the way from Div. to Busseboom.
