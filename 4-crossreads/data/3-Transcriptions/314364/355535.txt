<p>Fri.Jan.10<br/>Being Hut Corporal is a responsible Job. Very few chaps in 83 Hut care about appearing on Parade, &amp; I'm afraid the Sgt Major noticed me blush this morning when I reported "All correct.". This morning I asked Sgt.Duffy if he could find me a Job for a few days, so that I would not have to attend Parade. He said "there was nothing doing in his department ". Just then the Hospital q.m. appeared on the scene, so I asked him for a Job. He fixed me up right away, so now I can keep indoors out of the wet. There is not much to do but it is much better indoors than paddling about in the mud.  I went to see the Q.M. about the waterproof cape, but he says the note is useless, as it does not bear an officer's signature. So now I've got to go thro' it all again.  If I <u>do</u> manage to get my 15/3 back I shall have just about earned it.<br/>Sat.11.<br/>There are a number of German prisoners working around the Camp. I should have said "<u>supposed</u> to be working" for what they do is harmless. They are a long time fixing up about the Peace Conference, but it's a mighty big undertaking, &amp; it's best not to hurry. 4 chaps in this Hut are on the "Ulysses" so the party that came here from Westham are gradually dwindling away. I don't care how soon <u>my</u> turn comes.<br/>Sun.12. The sun is actually shining today. Quite a treat to see it. Riley, the chap in the Q.M. store with me is on the "Ulysses". He went to bid his Girl "Goodbye" so I was left in charge. Wrote a letter to Lill, but forgot to number it,  so I can't count it as one. Being a fine day the Camp is almost deserted. We got a pretty good dinner on Sunday, thank Goodness. "If you love me, Miss Absolom, then don't offer me <u>stew</u></p>
