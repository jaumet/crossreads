<p>14/7/19 Chemnitz<br/>Fine and warm. Still unwell. Hard on the starboard bow &ndash; the Cap Verde islands. There was some haze which spoilt the view but they seem hilly and white villages are planted on the steep hillsides. After running along the coast for some time we passed a very high peak &ndash; which seemed to be the termination of a chain. I take this to be Teneriffe. It went up high like a large cloud and remained in sight until we were many miles away from it. On this deck the men play games and sing &ndash; some of the tunes they sing over and over again. One is "How can you keep them down on the farm after they've seen Paree". Rather pertinent. Our consumption of fresh water is still much too high.</p>
