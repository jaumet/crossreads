They shouted "go it "Joey" - "Aint .E. funny", Hip Hooray" -
My triumph & my failures & then, my fall.
They've rung the bell
The Curtains down
Im waiting for my call.  Bills;  Not those I owe but old Play bills of the Show 
My name as Hamlet, Lear, Virginious, Shylock, Ingomar
The laurel on my brow a favourite & now =
forgotten! - A Fallen Star
