Tuesday 13 August
Poor old Ridgeway died of his wounds. Wonderfully quiet all day, but very hot.
Several ?planes have come down in flames I think that one must have been ours.
A C.C. The village of Rosieres just on our right is one huge dump.
Wednesday 14 August
A German ?plane brought down by the A.A.'s this morning. Just now a Boshe plane chased one of our R.E. 8s old slow artillery observers extremely low down brought him down about a hundred yards away. It was the coolest thing I have seen, two miles or more over our line but of course our plane had no hope at all. Very hot again to-day.
Fritz heavily shelling Vauvillers just on our left.
