<p>"20. Saying, Arise, and take the young child, and his Mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child's life."<br/>"21 And he arose, and took the young child and his Mother, and came into the land of israel."<br/>These verses bear repeating, being so important to us of the Christian faith; which is built upon these occurrences as basic facts.  What think you?</p>
<p>Serious thoughts have come into my mind about the war, owing to the so frequent change of intention of those who are concerned with the movement of the Australian troops.  For more than two weeks now have intimations been issued "Get ready with a view to moving at any moment.  Wednesday will be the day for you to get away.  Thursday those people are to break camp."  Yet the appointed days of the week come and go finding nothing done &amp; everyone still at Mena Camp.  Why have the calculations of those in high places so grievously miscarried?  Something must have happened compelling them to alter plans, which one might reasonably expect that they had fully worked out and for which there was urgent necessity should be carried forward without delay.  Alterations of well planned schemes, &amp; loss of time in moving, are of great moment in times of war, and their alterations gives pause for thought amongst those who are playing a hand.</p>
<p>The highly varnished cables served up to us may have as chief function the concealing of the truth.  If this be so, there must come a day for the blunt facts to be exposed then the last condition will be immeasurably worse than the first, and they who have deceived the intelligence of the nation will be made to pay dearly for their acts.</p>
