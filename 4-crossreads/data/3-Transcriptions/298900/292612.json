<p>&amp; after a fairly rough trip we reached Boulogne about 1.30 P.M.   Four boats were in the convoy &amp; we had Torpedo boats as an escort.   We were free when we reached France so we straightway had a good dinner at a restaurant nearby.   Then after leaving our kit at the Station we took the tram to Wimmereaux in order to see our friends at the Hospital.    After tea we returned in order to catch a leave bus which was going to our camp.   However much to our disgust we found that the blanky thing did not go so perforce had to walk back to the Hospital this time with our kit, a distance of about 2 &frac12; miles.   On arrival we were given a bed in a ward so spent the night in comfort.</p>
