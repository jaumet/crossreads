<p>for some fruit, &amp; these suited us down to the ground, I saw an Egyptian fox one day prowling round one of the canals, they are not so red as the fox as we know being of a darker colour &amp; smaller they have a bonzer brush. New Year's Day was very cloudy &amp; dusty here, the sand being of a different color to Mena.<br/>I got quite a swag of parcels here one day, from all over the place .<br/>My arm was getting pretty crook again from the effects of the cuts from the bomb in Lone Pine" so I went to the Dr for the first time since enlisting that was a good record wasn't it he sent me to hospital for he said a spell would do me no harm</p>
