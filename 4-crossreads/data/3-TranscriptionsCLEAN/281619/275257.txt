 Dec 15th  Route march to windmills on the hills.  Here we saw the crushing of wheat for flour by the stones driven by windmill 
 Dec 20th  The withdrawal from Anzac & Suvla Bay is now an accomplished fact, accomplished with the loss of not one man & now only Cape Helles is the only position held on the Peninsular.  Absolutely nothing of any value was left  stores etc being burnt & a few old guns were blown up as a farewell   a large mine much larger than any previous one was fired under the trenches of the Turks from the beach.  The preparations were elaborate & worked without a hitch, the actual withdrawal being accomplished a day earlier than was anticipated.  Every thing was left perfectly clean & many notes left for Jacko.  To show those men last in the trenches direction the paths were all whitened so practically no one could be lost.  The last man to leave was Gen Birdwood [not true] at about 3.30.  At 4.40 the Turks bombarded the positions little dreaming that the trenches were empty.

 Jan 2nd  Marching orders.  Baggage guard & have to load gear on to barges then again from barge on to ship "Empress of Britain"  In fact I think this puts the finishing touches on my education.  Wharf labouring  loading slings etc to be put into hold.  Leave Lemnos with between 5000 & 6000 troops on board, including Harry.  The ship is fast being a CPR Express steamer mounting a 6" gun & 8 machine guns.  Strict regulations re submarines defence.  Lifebelts to be worn throughout voyage & no smoking allowed after six pm.   Lemnos  is a quaint place being inhabited with Greek peasants & dotted all over with small villages separated only by a mile or so.  Industry is conspicuous
