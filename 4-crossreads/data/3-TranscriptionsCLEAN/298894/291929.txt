  
 Sunday 30th. Spent about 3 hours bargaining with some Greeks for a boat. They asked various prices from 1 to 10/- for the afternoon. We noticed one boat which we wanted but they would not tell us the owner, so we promptly took some oars from a boat nearby & started to row away when the owner announced himself quickly. We could not come to terms with him but refused to leave the boat till he arranged for another. We then arranged for one to cost 6/- from 1PM to 6PM. On our arrival he was non est, so after more bargaining arranged with another for 5/- from 2PM to 6PM & started off just as the first man appeared on the scene. Well we managed to get off after some swearing etc & arrived at the "Mauretania" & went aboard to look over her. A striking feature is the narrowness of the bows necessary perhaps for her speed. The tonnage is 45000 tons & she had on board 5000 fresh English troops. A corporal A.M.C. man took us in tow & showed us round & we caused some mild excitement, the majority never having seen Australians, expecting to see Blacks perhaps. We could hear comments on all sides as we walked along about the Australians, our chaps having made a reputation. The ship herself is wonderful. Electric Elevators etc & the fittings are splendid. From here we went off to H.M.S. Vengeance & asked permission to go aboard. A young fellow showed us round & everywhere we went they treated us splendidly shewing us the Guns, mechanism, shells, magazines etc. Then nothing would please them until we stayed to tea.
