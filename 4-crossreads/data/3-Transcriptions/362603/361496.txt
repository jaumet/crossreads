<p>Australian Army Medical Corps, A.I.F. letterhead<br/>1st Dermatological Hospital,<br/>Staff Recreation Room (Church Army),<br/>Bulford, Salisbury.<br/>July 23rd 1917<br/>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,<br/>I am just now going to start to give You a few details of my Trip to Manxland again.  I had better tell you all from Day to Day &amp; then I'll remember everything in order.  I set out from Hospital on 14/8/17 at 12 Noon.  One of my best Friends who was going to London on 2 days leave went with me.  We had dinner in Salisbury &amp; leaving S'bury at 1.50 pm arrived in London at 3.30 pm.  I journeyed via the Tube to Euston &amp; have booked through to Liverpool, I set out for some Mungaree.  I went to the A.B.C. Restaurant just outside the Gates in Euston Road, &amp; had something to eat (1/3 worth is all that is allowed during the afternoon), so being still hungry I went down to another shop &amp; bought some fruit &amp; cake.  I admired some peaches &amp; grapes but the former were 6d &amp; 8d each &amp; only very small &amp; the latter 2/6 per lb so I did not invest.  I left Euston at 5.30 pm &amp; My Travelling Companions were 2 Liverpool Jack Tars, a Tommy from Kent, a Scotsman &amp; Ulsterman from Belfast &amp; a Belgian artilleryman.  The latter spoke no English at all &amp; I was able to help Him a little with the tiny scrap of French that I picked up in Egypt.  I arrived in L'pool at 10.15 pm &amp; straightway went down &amp; took my Room at the Angel Hotel in Dale Street</p>
