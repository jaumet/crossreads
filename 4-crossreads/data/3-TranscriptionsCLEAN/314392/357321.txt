  
 Pack Troop had not yet arrived so I went to the observation Station  & saw Reg Mastuson (Lieut)  I then returned to Montaubau, but as the accommodation was bad  & and it was fast becoming dark I decided to return to the Observation Station  & stay till morning when I would have a day in which to make a Suitable dug out. 7th Raining. Returned to Montaubau. Everything is in undescribably chaos. Hard work all day to get things in order. Convoy blown up 1 man killed. 4 wounded. 2 seriously. 7 mules killed. Certainly a bad start. Still we hope for better results later on.
