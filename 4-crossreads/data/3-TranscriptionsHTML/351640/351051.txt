<p>Girls<br/>Still are we in this harbour surrounded by great and small ships of all kind.</p>
<p>I have just completed a letter to Herschell Harris, who is said to be with his X-ray apparatus attached to No. 3 A. G. Hospital, harry McCormack, Dick, and others with him. I met Dr. Dick in Alexandria he told me that there is not surgical work at No 3, &amp; now I can quite understand why. The harbour is wide the winds are strong, the wharface accommodation practically nil. These all make the matter of landing surgical cases a matter of difficulty. All are therefore sent on by the ships to Alexandria or other ports where the conveniences for landing are complete.</p>
<p>Rather an apt quotation on my calendar this morning<br/>"The self sacrifice of a human being is not a lovely thing. It is often a necessary and a noble thing; but no form nor degree of suicide can be ever lovely." The Ethics of the Dust.</p>
<p>Today is set down as the anniversary of the birth of Virgil. He is the Roman Author, who set out in Latin in his Aeniad the Voyage of Aeneas and his people from Troy (Dardanus), along the Mediterranean <strike>sea</strike> Sea to Carthage, where Dido ruled as queen, in the North of Africa, then back &amp; North again, passing the straights of Messina, to the shores of Latium, between <strike>Rome</strike> Naples and Rome. <strike>His descen</strike> The descendants of Aeneas, were Romulus &amp; Remus who are the real or mythical founders of Rome. May be the birthday is correct or approximately correct as B.C. 50 and October 15.</p>
<p>The temperature here is cold as compared with Egypt. Jerom found for me medium underclothing, with these putties ad a heavier suit of kahkhi I feel quite comfortable. We are in about the same lattitude as Anzac. We shall be quite all right. Tata. Tata. Tata.</p>

<p>[Sir Alexander MacCormick, 1856-1947, surgeon and army medical officer, went to England at the outbreak of war and served with the British Expeditionary Force at Boulogne. Also commissioned in the Australian Army Medical Corps, he was sent to Lemnos. Frustrated at not being able to operate there, he returned to Australia in February 1916 but rejoined the AIF when his eldest son was killed in action in October of that year, and served as a surgeon in France.]</p>
