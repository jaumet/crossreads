The position is complicated by the fact that there is no more room for even the Lowland Division on the small stretch which we hole. However, this can be overcome by keeping the reserve divisions on the islands, like Imbros, Tenedos or Lemnos, where they can be taken to Gallipoli in a few hours on tugs, trawlers and destroyers, without much fear of submarines. The whole point is, you must be able to relieve the troops in the front line as often as possible in the arduous work of sapping against the enemy's trenches or after they have lost heavily in an assault. It is asking too much to expect the same men to go forward day after day as they have been asked to do up to the present.
