<p>killed or something.About Bert's pay. I think you will find his pay would be stopped when he was taken prisoner. But if the Savings Bank will send the money across to the Commonwealth in England. I shall be abel to fix him up with what he wants. It is no use trying to get money in the pay book. 40 francs a fortnight doesn't go very far. Of coarse it is enough while across here but one wants something if they get across to England. I am about due for four days leave to ( Paris) but wont be abel to go as I haven't the money in my pay book. I have been back in France nearly 12 months now. My leave should come in November so it will be plenty of time to get the money across the Bank can <strike>change</strike>cabel it across then stop the cost of cable from bank book. Give them my reg no 2837 L.cpl &amp; Batt no need for company. I think I told you before leaving Sydney. Will you get some of my photos</p>
