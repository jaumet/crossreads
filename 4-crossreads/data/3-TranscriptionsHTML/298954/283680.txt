<p>We have a new mess-rate now now.   Captain Burgess of the P.S.N.C.   An amusing old card &amp; a perfect cook!   What a pity we have as little to cook, though!   There have been no packets for the last fortnight and even I have almost exhausted my credit with the Majah!   Damn him &ndash; the Scotch cow.   We are horribly hungry;   even old George is wailing now &amp; he is the most even tempered, philosophic and take-things-as-they-come chap I know.   Geo. (otherwise Purser Norman Pyne of the"Matunga" ) is the First Person of our Holy Trinity (bloody blasphemous we're getting, aren't we?) is the ideal chap to live with in hard-luck times.    A typical "Aussie", unselfish, adaptable, <u>and</u> a Good Cook, and <u>not</u> possessed of Temperament, Geo. is the sort of pal that one values.   He is also a Notability.   There are three Australians in this cosmopolitan hell, Smithy, Geo. &amp; self.</p>
<p>Smithy is a celebrated "soubrette", a celebrated swimmer and contortionist, my humble self am a celebrated tragedie<u>nne</u> and deft (!) handler of comedy roles, Geo. is a notability because he is an "Aussie" and is <u>not</u> notable (in the public way.)</p>
