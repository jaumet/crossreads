civilian can come to Port Said unless he has some very excellent reason.  Hence there are comparatively few civilians there.As I predicted I did not have any delicious amusement there though I enjoyed my stay very much.But the place is chock full of soldiers  & so there are many restrictions  &  thus one has to make ones own amusement; and to do so a companion who has much the same tastes  &  temperament is essential.
