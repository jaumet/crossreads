18We travelled with the 7th Coy but kept well ahead of them & enjoyed ourselves at each village we came to. It took 4 days for the convoy to get here so we had plenty of spells. The roads were excellent & the country beautiful. Every inch of the land is cultivated & is a grand sight. Poppies, cornflowers, buttercups & daisies grow abundantly in the wheat crops & the picture it presents is more easily imagined than described. The villages we passed through were very pretty & we secured a good bed each night. We had lovely weather all the way but it is trying to rain to-day. We camp in the front room
