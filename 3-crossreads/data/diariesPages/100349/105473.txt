Stayed about reserves yesterday doing fatigue, in a steady downpour of rain. An alarm went and we stood-to ready to go back to the front line. Fritz counterattacked during the night, but we were not called upon. The sight of our guns answering the S.O.S. signal was a grand spectacle. The ground seemed to shake, with the shock of thousands of guns firing. Went and buried a cable for the Signal Company this morning. The excited way the enemy artillery is firing shows that he is badly rattled. Expect to be releived tonight.

Got releived alright, came back to Dickebushe by way of roads that were an indescribable sight. They were lined along with shattered; waggons, lorries, guns, ambulances; dead horses
