<p>3/3/19 Marcinelle<br/>Today was rather wet. Went round the 22nd. and 24th. in the morning. Work is a minus quantity now nearly save for a daily inspection of rifles. We despatched a good many horses to the Base today under Jim Farrell. After lunch there was little to do save read until 4 when I went into Charleroi which was closed to troops. Today there was a Labour manifestation or general strike for the privilege of working 8 hours daily. Processions and bands. Went to the Ecole Berlitz for a French lesson. Good linguists here most of the girl teachers speak several languages. One could understand from this cross examining system how a school like this could be used for espionage or as a "bordel". Wined and yarned all the evening with Monsieur Corneille and went to bed on rosecolored cloud.</p>
