<p>Dear Maurice</p>
<p>I am very glad to learn that you are taking things seriously.</p>
<p>You must not be discouraged because I do not altogether swallow your choice of a profession.  Seldom are Father &amp; Son in agreement on this question:  but acting on the memory of my own rather pathetic lack of sympathy &amp; support from my own people I do not wish to obstruct but only to help.  When I return we can go into the matter in a careful &amp; friendly way and find out if there is a way to help you and a way to help Mick &amp; myself to get some satisfaction in watching your progress.  It is most satisfactory to learn also that you are keeping steady, that is an asset in itself which the employer namely the World gives big money to hire, and gives to the owner of the asset more satisfaction in later life than the gobbling up quickly of the adventures of life.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
