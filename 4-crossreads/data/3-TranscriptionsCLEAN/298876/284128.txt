A beautiful day - a fine fresh breeze blowing right through our Cabin, result, we have had the best sleep today since we've been on Night Duty.
No 1 Hospital full 15 beds 3 cases of Pneumonia, very bad, occasionally go off their Heads, think nothing of breaking out of bed & God knows what they would (Can't get any sleep if a night they want too much watching). Two more cases of Mumps reported today.No Boat drill today.  Sea as calm as a lake.We were all disappointed at not seeing Cocos Island; we passed it on Wednesday night about 30 miles out. I fancy I saw some flashes of light during night so think it must have been the Light House there. Each Reinforcement in turn have possession of Deck for Cocerts of a night, some very good talent
