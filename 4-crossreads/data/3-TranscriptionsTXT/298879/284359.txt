April 1915Monday 12Learnt The various knots (likely to be useful) out of an Engineering Manual. Very warm. Many of the men indulge in swimming over the ships side. Paid today 1-8 in English money as Egyptian money is useless here. Received letters from home. Some chaps got as many as fourteen. I am well satisfied with the five I got.
Tuesday 13Wrote a short note to Doris [?] as I cannot put much in it. Did some signalling practice. Some of our chaps had practice in embarking and disembarking. Had a concert in our quarters superintended by Dean Tolbert. Three British Warships reported sunk in the Dardanelles waters.
