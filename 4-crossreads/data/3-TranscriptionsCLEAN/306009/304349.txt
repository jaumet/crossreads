We are not pulling in unison - the non-coms. are not pulling together but seem agreed on one point; to leave a jolly good amount of work to the 2 poor unfortunate Privates. Found time after tea for a walk through the pretty English quarter at Gezira - Fine big houses surrounded by gardens on either side of long leafy lanes. Another Australian mail was received to-day, there being for me  6 letters, 1 postcard, &  1 paper = 13 letters this week plus 2 cards plus 1 paper.
