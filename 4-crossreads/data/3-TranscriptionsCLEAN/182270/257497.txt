FRIDAY, JULY 4, 1919.
Fine & warm. Tickle took the wagon
down to Boundary with netting &
salt. Got some logs in Boundary
scrub & took them to Walhallow
for cutting. I brought 198 sheep
out of Wheelers & put them in
Woolshed. Were going to Merilong
for the night then over to kangaroo
shoot at Glen Moan but it
was put off at last minute.
