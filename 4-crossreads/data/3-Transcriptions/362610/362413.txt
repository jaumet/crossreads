<p>Sunday 16 July 1916<br/>Another broken Sabbath as seems quite customary in the battn. After breakfast everything had to be packed up &amp; abt. 10.30 the battn. moved out in a general NE direction. The day was fine &amp; fairly warm &amp; the amount of traffic passing along the road we traversed meant that there was plenty of dust flying. The country passed thro' was very similar to what we have gone through the last few days. It was not very long before we once more came within sound of gun fire, but fairly distant. Several villages were passed through, our destination being Warloy-Baillen, at present a big hospital clearing centre, &amp; a medium sized village. The main road at almost all times of the day is a busy scene with the lines of transport passing outward to the Front. A large number of troops are quartered here. Our own billet is a single room belonging to an old couple who have a nice garden in which the currants are just ripe : we frequently buy a couple of pounds.</p>
