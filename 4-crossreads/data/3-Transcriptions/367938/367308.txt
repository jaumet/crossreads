Clarke, two others &amp; myself went down to a point where there is a beautiful sandy bottom when one gets out about 25ft: while undressing the sound of bullets was very unpleasant &amp; just as I was going in they began to lob a few feet away; however I went in thinking they were spents, 2 of the others <u>got</u> &amp; the other in the water came out &amp; ran. I thought they wld. not mind <u>one</u> washing himself so I swam out, but as they pinged in the water</p>
