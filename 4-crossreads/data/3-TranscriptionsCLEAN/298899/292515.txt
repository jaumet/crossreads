  
 Things fairly quiet as we left. Arrived at the camp just before lunch but managed to have a sponge over and change of underclothing first & my word what a relief it was. I felt a new man being further stimulated by the receipt of a large mail. Walked into Reninghelst at night. 
 Wednesday 3rd October   Had a day of rest & it was much appreciated. Managed to write a few letters owing a long time. Disturbed at night by guns posted near firing at aircraft. 
 Thursday 4th October  Did my washing & packed up most of my curios for the post, also went through my panniers etc & got things square again, they being all mixed up with A Section gear. At midday word came that B & C sections tent subdivision had to report to No. 3 Canadian & No 17 British C.C.S. for duty so we packed up & reported about 6 p.m. B to the Canadians C to the British
