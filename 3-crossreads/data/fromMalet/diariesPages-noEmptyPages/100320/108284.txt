and there left the nurses. Got lost after wandering among the old booksellers boxes and ended up at Gare du Orleans. Tubed to Opera bought the book of Faust and then returned to hotel. Went to Arrigonis for dinner and then to the Opera to see "Thais". Had a few words with a very insolent elderly doorkeeper and came near to knocking him right down the marble staircase. Had a fairly good seat next to some Yank VDVADs and we were soon friends. The house was crowded and there were any number of English speaking people there. A very fine dancer in the "divertissement". The scenery & music of this play are both very fine indeed. Walked back at 11 along the Rue de la Paix to my hotel and then read for a while before going to sleep – a tiring day.
