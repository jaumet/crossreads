3/7/19 "Chemnitz" Hull
A quiet day aboard the ship. I had a talk to Captn Young, the Master, and arranged some things with him. Reid the elderly Chief Officer is a character and there is also a pilot aboard. The ship began to look a bit more trim by noon and was inspected by the Admiralty surveyor and others. Afternoon I went up the town and did some shopping. Hull had a half holiday today and the city was deader than ever. A slummy place and wretched type of people. Going to sea builds up their bodies a bit and makes up for wretched houses. A good deal of eating to do here but the sea air and smell of wet paint send up ones appetite. Other ships with lesser crews are alongside.
