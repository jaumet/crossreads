Bomb proof. Five German (Prussian Guard) prisoners were brought in tonight, 3 of them wounded, we were talking to them for a long time (trying to understand one another), it rained to-night. Sunday 27th still rainy looking. We moved 8 of us off to the advanced D. station at 7.30 AM it rained during the day, just after tea, as usual the bombardment started, it lasted about an hour, guns roared alround us, the din was terrific, shells fell very close to us, which made us get into our dug out, later on one fell just outside, the concussion almost knocking us over.  Monday we left the the Advanced station & met the others at the main dressing station. We marched off to our old Billet at Becourt, it was raining. We fell in again at 2PM & marched to Warloy near Contay, about 9 mile, where we were billeted. Tuesday 29th we marched off at 9.45 & camped the afternoon & night at Toutencourt about 4 mile away (in huts)  after tea it blew terribly hard for about 45 minutes, numerous branches being broken off the trees, it teemed rain at the same time. Wednesday we marched out at 7.30 to place called Montrelet about 1 1/4 mile further on, it rained practically all the time & we were wet through, on the way we met a large number of Canadians, marching in the opposite direction. Rumours say & appear to be right, that we are changing position with them. We are billeted in Barns in the village.  Friday 1st September fine though rainy looking. Yesterday about 16 "Anzacs" were decorated by Gen. Birdwood, including one of our chaps, for conspicuous bravery. Saturday fine  I was taken on strength of the 7th Field Ambulance. Sunday 3rd we left Montrelet at about 9.45 AM & arrived at Longuevillette which is about 2 or 3 miles further on & was put up in billets.Monday raining best part of morning, windy & stormy-looking in the afternoon. There is a lot of crops growing in all the parts of France, in which we have so far. When
