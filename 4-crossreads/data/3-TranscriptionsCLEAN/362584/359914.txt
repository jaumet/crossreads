Dear Mrs Ferguson
Received this dear little parcel this morning. My Birthday so delighted. Also got a cable from home to me. Moving again very shortly probably tomorrow. I am going into Ismailia to the Club to Dinner tonight & shall enjoy it immensely.
I am sending home a lot of undeveloped photo films & a few prints & asked Mother & Father to send them to you.
Dorothy would go dippy if she knew my horse Phyllis. Give her my best love.
Please tell the Judge that Alroy Cohen has joined up this Battalion. Shall write to Judge too this mail.
Best of Love
C R Lucas
