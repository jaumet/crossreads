<p>Friday, 1 October, 1915<br/>Much better to-day went back on duty.  The 25 menreturned from Imbros to-day.  There has been a great rumour the past few days amongst the L.H.Bdes concerning a rising in the Sudan and that a Bde of Light Horse is going from Egypt to quell it and that they are taking the pick of our horses.  It is not confirmed yet and our chaps are very incensed at the thought of being deprived the trip as they have proved themselves so efficient not only as L.H. but as Inf.  The bombardment of the Narrows still continues day &amp; night.  Rec three stray letters one dated 5th May.</p>
<p>Saturday, 2 October, 1915<br/>Received three Reinforcement Officers during the night.</p>
<p>Along side my dug out is a big reserve water tank, and it is part of the A.M.C. [Army Medical Corps] mens duties to keep the water supply pure, and be in charge of it.  Consequently they are going to fill the tank daily by means of mule transport from the well, and the men will draw their water supply from it under my supervision so I will not be working in the dressing station so much it is an easy job but as lazy one the water allowance is one gallon per man per day.</p>
<p>From what I hear there has been a big Naval Movement in the Narrows. Wrote to my father to-day from whom I rec a letter yesterday.</p>
