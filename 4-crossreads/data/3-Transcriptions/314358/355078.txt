<p>4<br/>Gods own masterpiece.</p>
<p>Beautiful sycamore trees grow at entrance of the graveyard.</p>
<p>Here are Australian soldiers resting in the shade and slaking their thirst with lemonade purchased from the wily Arab who is always picturesque no matter however grainy.</p>
<p>Not far away is the railway station, very like any other of a similar size.</p>
<p>Hope the censor wont cut out this simple description for there is not much to write about.</p>
<p>That is there is not much which is allowable.</p>
<p>I receive a letter from Mother dated 29 March, this reached me when at Suez about Good Friday.  A post office soldier got it before it went on further and brought it to me.</p>
<p>But there must be heaps of letters astray for I have not received any from you (with exception of one same date as Mothers I suppose) for a long time.</p>
<p>Charging about as we have to puts everything wrong.</p>
<p>Glad to hear so well of the dear children of who I am very proud.</p>
<p>I have not got a word from you yet about the first box of things I sent although Mother mentioned something about it.</p>
