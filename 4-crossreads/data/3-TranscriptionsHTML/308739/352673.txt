<p>Tuesday 14 March 1916<br/>Regimental Parade &amp;amp; swimming is the order of to-day.<br/>Lieu. Cunningham of Post Office, Alexandria is now Capt. &amp;amp; is stationed at Cairo.  The postal work for Light Horse Men is now principally done at Port Tewfic on Suez Canal entrance.  The mail is taken direct off the mail Boats &amp;amp; sorted in a large Stone Building specially erected for the purpose, &amp;amp; then sent on to the different camps.</p>
<p>Wednesday 15 March 1916<br/>Reg. Parade today.  Swimming parties are formed under an Officer to proceed to Canal for Swimming.  The men thoroughly enjoy the outing.  Artists in the Regiments arrange the Name &amp;amp; place of the Brigade, with Stones &amp;amp; Sand on the Banks of Canal so all &amp;amp; sundry can distinguish the country we spring from.  There is very little currants in Canal which is strange, as two Great Oceans connect.</p>
