Saturday 21 DecemberRotten weather, cold, windy & wet & there is not much to do in these parts.
Sunday 22 DecemberAnother visit to Charleroi, about 17 kilos away, partly walking, then on a Belgians cart & thence by tram. The City on Sunday is very gay indeed & the streets thronged with people.  Cafes, Cabarets & Picture houses in full swing & one, the Trianon cafe & picture house, is very good & typically continental.Place brilliantly lighted at night.However, coming home in the dark, wet, & windy, night getting very wet, partly a pied, & partly &agrave; cheval, was not too brilliant.
