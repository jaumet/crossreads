but my partner could not pick up the tune & so we lost.  You will be pleased to hear that portion of the hair on my upper lip has disappeared, the terminal three quarter inch on each side has been removed with the result that I have much the same appearance as the old man after he has paid a visit to the barber except that my smile is much less like that of a Cheshire cat.   Sister Stobo to the rescue with the loan of a fiver.On 22nd inst. I had about 6 sets of deck tennis in the morning & am pleased to say that I have developed into quite a decent player - my service is particularly deadly.At the present moment it is very difficult to concentrate oneself on letter writing - on the deck immediately above my head about a dozen men are practising words of command & some of them have very loud voices.   It is surprising the number of things that the men can be put to on board ship, at first we thought that owing to the limited deck space they would have nothing to do, but what with physical exercises, word of command drill, lectures, fire boat & collision drill, inspections galore & general fatigues their time is pretty well taken up.   A lot of them assist the crew in cleaning desks etc, others help the cooks, & others again take a hand down in the stoke hole
