a good day at Charlestown looking round the sailors home, going for a walk and a good talk with Mr. Nicholls who is a warrant officer in the Navy. Both going and returning we had an hour to spend at Dumfirline so walked round the main streets. We also visited the Glen, which is Carnegies birth-place. These are really lovely grounds
