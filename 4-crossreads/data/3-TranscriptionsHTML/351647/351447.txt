<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Just a few lines tonight, I'm very off colour with a bad cold &amp; we are busy but they've warned us that we'll be on the move tomorrow &amp; won't have any more chance of writing for a while so I'm just sending you a few lines.  I don't know where we are going, I have an idea but can't say.  However I hope to be able to write again soon &amp; have at least a little news.</p>
<p>Give my love to the boss &amp; Mac &amp; Graham &amp; lots to yourself.  I can never repay all your kindness &amp; goodness to me but I never will forget it, I often think of my time at Tog, wish I were there tonight.  This is a rotten letter but you'll understand won't you.</p>
<p>Yours as always<br/>Jim Wilkie</p>
<p>Keep on writing as usual.</p>
