<p>people present.  I got leave &amp; went into town in the afternoon.  Went out to Abbassia Barracks to see if I could find a Cousin Douglas Moncrieff's friend but he had gone the week before, so came on to Heliopolis to see to the Austn wounded.  They all seemed very cheerful.  I stayed there yarning till after 6.  Saw Harry Fitzgerald in town at night.  We believed him dead so it was a great surprise.  Got the 10.30pm train back home.</p>
<p>Monday 10th<br/>Went out on an early morning parade.  Got back at 9.30 &amp; had breakfast at 10 oclock.  Nothing to do the rest of the day.</p>
<p>May 11th<br/>Was mess orderly with Dick Blackwell.  The heat was pretty solid.  Spent some time under the shower.  It was the only cool place to get.  The Regt went out on foot at 4pm</p>
