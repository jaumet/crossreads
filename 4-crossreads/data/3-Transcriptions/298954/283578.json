<p>1918<br/>Sat. 23rd Feb.<br/>All sorts of rumours circulating as to the fate of the "Ingotz Mendi", for which we are supposed to be waiting quietly here.   At all events she has not arrived and it looks as if "Wolf" will make her "Triumphant Entry into Kiel" solus.   (There is plenty of time for this latter to be "stage-managed", so it should be be effective.)</p>
<p>A captured prize following would have added greatly to the "Heimkehr", which we believe takes place tomorrow.   Another small cruiser and a two-funnelled auxiliary were this afternoon added to our escort.</p>
<p>A grand "Foc'sl Farewell" took place tonight in the main no 4 hold.</p>
<p>The usual clog-dancing, concertinos and songs from the English Music 'Alls.   The audience was more entertaining than the concert &ndash; representatives of almost every nationality extant were crammed into the narrow space surrounding the performers.</p>
