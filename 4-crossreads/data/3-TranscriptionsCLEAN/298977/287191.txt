My dear Mother,
Your letter of the 8th August came to hand here to-day and I was very pleased to hear from you as it is only the second time I have heard from home since I left.  Ruby's came at the same time.  The news was therefore a little stale, but nevertheless was very much appreciated.  I am pretty certain some of my letters from home have gone astray and no doubt I will get a lot of old ones in a bunch, as I feel sure you are writing every week.  Have received no parcels or papers yet.  Also have not heard from Rita except Aus Day Post Card.
Glad that Father has gone away for his trip, I hope it will do him good, though I suppose by the time you receive this he will be home again.
I am not at all surprised to hear that Os is coming over and I am very pleased indeed he is.  He is only doing his duty and it is an experience I would not have missed for anything, and I feel sure it is doing me a lot of good in many ways.  Things were all right with me in Egypt.  My head grew a little too level for that.
Things here are practically as usual, though we have our little excitements and adventures.  All the little details I will have to leave over till I get back.
Keep the news and parcels coming.  Make a spec of chocolates and cigarettes.
Love fromPte 1280 Roy Richards.
P.S. I know this is very short, but paper supply is shorter.
