May 1915Tuesday 18Fine. Some light horse chaps said to be in the trenches on our left. Turks very quiet but busy. Carried mail up from beach. Busy at night time getting rations for quarter master of our Batt. Very little sleep. Enemy bombarded our trenches furiously. We were nearly driven crazy trying to dodge the terrific shell fire
Wednesday 19Fine Ordered into the sap as extra lookout   The Turks attacked strongly about 3 AM. Their yell was thrilling as they charged our trenches. Our rifle fire was terrific. The machine guns on each flank did good work also. The Turks charged right up to the parapets. They retired about daylight leaving hundreds of dead and wounded.
