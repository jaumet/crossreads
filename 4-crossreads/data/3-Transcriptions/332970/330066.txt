<p>14th Feb 1915 Sunday. A nasty, dusty windy day. I wouldn't mention this except for the usual conduct of the battalion heads, the Colonel &amp; Major Ellis. After church parade, the order was given. All tent flaps to be rolled up, and kits piled outside the tent door. This is supposed to be for purposes of hygiene, but as the dust is about 5 inches deep outside, the consequence is that the tents which were tolerably clean &amp; neat before are now rapidly becoming filled with dust, clothes, blankets and gear is getting messed up with it, and all the men are thoroughly uncomfortable for the day. This laudable object achieved, our beloved? heads are no doubt happy. <strike>for the day,</strike> And the NCOs are blamed that the men are discontented &amp; grumble at the officers. There seems to be no petty way of bickering &amp; annoying them that is not practised by the hopeless bundles of red tape</p>
