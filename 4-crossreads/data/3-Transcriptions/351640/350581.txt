<p>Please send this letter on to Mollie, as I shall not be able to write to her in time for post in the morning and it may be I shall not be able to send forward any more correspondence for some time.  She can of course return it if you so desire. The remarks about the Museum might do for some of the newspapers, D. Telegraph or other.</p>
<p>Father McAuliffe said Mass in the Camp at 7 A.M. &amp; 9 a.m. today.  The last day of Feby. And the second Sunday in lent.</p>
<p>On these moonlight nights people come from Cairo in motor cars to visit the pyramids.  A jolly crowd has just rolled past 2-30 a.m., if 'mongst them be ambitions and enthusiastic spirits they may climb to the top of Kheops and from his summit peer through the moonlight into the surrounding country.  Coffee will be ready on the top, prepared by natives with the hope to gather piasters from the visitors.</p>
<p>Last evening I dined at the Chalet with Dr. Scheuber at 7-30 p.m.  Dr. Buchanan, a young man formerly a resident at the Sydney Hospital, came along for a few minutes about 10 p.m.  The Chalet is a small building on the top of the sand hill above Mena House.  It belongs to the doctor.  He, the Russian, from Riga, about whom I wrote earlier.</p>
<p>And now goodnight.  May Fortune of the best be with each of you now &amp; always, and may you in thought and deed ever be a credit to your father.  To Mollie please send haps [heaps] of love &amp; loads of kisses from me.  To my friends give kindly salutation and say that some day I hope to meet them in Australia.<br/>To you each goes love in abundance &amp; kisses in plenty from</p>
<p>Your lvng &amp; affn Faree<br/>John B. Nash</p>
