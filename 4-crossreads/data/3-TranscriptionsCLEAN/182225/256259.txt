 1916   SUNDAY 21   MAY 
 A decent calm fine day the first since we left. Still in hospital & got a fresh cold on me. There was a church parade in the morning for all denominations and there was a kind of a hymn service in evening. Billy Hunter Warren Hogarth & Sarg. Macdougal were in a lot of the day yarning.
