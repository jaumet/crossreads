<p>Australian Hdqrs.<br/>Cairo<br/>28.4.19</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I had a letter from you written in Melbourne where you were suffering the penalty for having placed yourself within the limits of the Victorian quarantine regulations. I was glad to hear from later letters from Dorothy that you had all reached Sydney again without casualties</p>
<p>D tells me she did her best to get Influenza and effected a week's illness which however failed to reach the Influenza diagnosis. In a letter from home I heard she was alright again.</p>
<p>Our revolution here seems to have quietened down and there is persistent talk of an early continuation of demobilisation. How far the trouble is over I dont know. It appears to have settled as a result of the despatch of the Nationalist Party Champions to England and I suppose it depends on their reception how things will go here. Our people are still scattered through the provinces guarding against any further outbreaks and maintaining order generally</p>
<p>There have been no disturbances in Cairo for some weeks and people are again moving about</p>
