But you cannot come till you turn is up.  It would be nise if you were first would'ent it.  Mum has a lot of your letters tierd up in a shoe lace, a Blue Ribbin and anothere Ribbin.  Good-night for to-night.</p>
<p>25.10.19.18 night<br/>Mum is packing the eggs now while she told us to write to-you.  Mum went to Church to-day but we stayed at home and played all the time and mum was playing with all her might down there.  There are a lot of trees fallen down around the house there are two trees fallen down on the fence.  Much love from Ruth ox<br/>xxoo etc.</p>
