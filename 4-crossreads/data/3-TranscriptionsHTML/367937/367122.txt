<p>The hammocks are not too bad for sleeping in; you are frightened out of your life that they are going to break down with you when you first get in but once you are there you are right.<br/>If it gets rough I sleep up on deck, as the stuffyness down below upsets you, but I have only had to do that once.<br/>The stairs down below here are pretty slippery and at dinner time today a man was bringing down a dixie of potatoes; the first thing we knew was a shower of potatoes hit the floor, then a dixie with a crash &amp; then a man looking pained and surprised.<br/>Poor wretch! We all stood up and cheered and sang out "encore" but he could not see the joke.</p>
