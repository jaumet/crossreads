we often raid one another this causes a bit of fun I can tell you.
12th Heavy frost very cold this morning but we did not have breakfast till 8 so that was not so bad, in the afternoon we held a kit inspection took all the shortages of which I might say there were many, after this the Coy had finished for the day we put the rest of the evening in pulling down an old cover which had been used at one time to stable horses, what wood we got out is being used for our fires tonight.
Yesterday our Dr had a "feet inspection" he marked 60% as unfit for walking the other 3 Drs in the rest of the Bde done the same, they are trying to get us carted off in buses, but I think they will come a "gutser" for I hear we have to march, the 2nd 3rd Bdes went away in motors but for some unexplained reason we have to march although we were the last out of the line all our officers are very sore over it, rightly so.
