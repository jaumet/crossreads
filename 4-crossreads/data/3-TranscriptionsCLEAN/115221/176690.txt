Dear Nell
I opened your letter while lying at one of the Brooklyn wharves & am only just answering it.  I put it in one of my uniform pockets & only found it again today.  In any case it would have got to you no sooner, as when in N.Y. [New York] I was out at 10.30 a.m. & back at 12.30 m.n. a.m. I did not get a great quantity of writing done.
We have had a great trip right through fine all the way.  We called at Wellington first putting in 21/2 days there but only got a few - 10 - hours leave.  The rest of the time I put in in route marches.
Tahiti was our next call, there we put in 5 days with 50% leave each day.  We had a great time there feasting on all sorts of fruit from coconuts to bananas & oranges.  The people gave us an all round good time.  I managed to get off every day & on the Sunday afternoon three other chaps & I went for a spin in a Tin Lizzie.  It was a great run
