another beautiful fine place and very cosy and like the other Theatre's. The painting and decorations were a pleasure to the Eye. Each turn by the  Artists were well received and likewise the Orchestra of 12 performers, making altogether a first class show. The house came out at 10-45Pm and away I went to catch the last Train for Maida Vale calling in on my way for some Supper of Fish & Chip's. I eventually arrived home at 11-45 Pm & turned in. Thursday and Friday I spent very quiet, only going along on Friday Evening to the Oxford Theatre with my friend to see the "Night Watch" a Naval Drama with Madge Titheradge the leading Lady. It was a splendid play and Miss Titheradge played her part splendid being recalled several times after each Act, the other members of the Coy supported her well. This play and "Scandal" were the best I have seen on my Tour's. The Show was over at 11Pm and after seeing my friend off by a Bus I caught a Tube and soon was home again.
