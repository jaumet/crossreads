<p>March 1917<br/>20th   To day the company have been working between Millers Son &amp; the bottom of the ridge (Bappaume Ridge) making a Pack Track for Mules &amp; horses carrying ammunition &amp; rations forward.   Our water supply is obtained from a small well in the village (Most of the wells here have been destroyed or poisoned)<br/>21st.   We had a fall of snow during the night, but it thawed during the morning.   Our section started to fill in a large mine crater in the road between here &amp; Bappaume &amp; have made a fair impression on it.   The crater was about 50' across &amp; about 12' deep &amp; right on the intersection of two roads, but we hope to have traffic through to-morrow.</p>
