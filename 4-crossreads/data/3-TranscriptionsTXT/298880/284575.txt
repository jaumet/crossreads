 The Perfect Day - When you come to the end of a perfect day And you sit alone with your thoughts While the chimes ring out with a carol gay For the joy that the day has brought Do you think what the end of a perfect day Can mean to a tired heart When the sun goes down with a flaming ray And the dear friends have to part.
