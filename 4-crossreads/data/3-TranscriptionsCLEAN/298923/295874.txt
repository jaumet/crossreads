27 July 1918 Saturday (Whole page crossed out)Last night a wire came from General Chauvel congratulating me on D.S.O.   I sent word to the little wife to cable you- all night Cables have been coming to me & other Officers ringing me up.   I am greatly bucked & it will help me to carry on & do my job.  Posted notes yesterday & just had time to add the D.S.O. but it will be published in Australia & I will be found in Debretts WHOS WHO etc etc- Vanity all perhaps-  but we are but humans.  Went to dinner at Cavalry School Mess in Richon once the old Town Hall built by Rothschild, a nice place.
