Sudden news:- The Brigade, 1st, moves off tomorrow, and it may be that others will follow rapidly.  We shall soon follow no doubt.  Business is meant this time, unless some other great move happens, which will dam us back again.
I regret that after Nash in my telegram yesterday I did not put Mena.  You may guess it but had the extra word been inserted you could have sure of where I am.
Good bye now God bless you.
Please convey my best wishes & regards to all my friends, & say that I hope to meet them some time during the future in Macquarie St., or elsewhere.
To you go heaps of love & loads of kisses from, & a share for MariaYour loving & affectionate FatherJohn B. Nash
