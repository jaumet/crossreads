 Wednesday 30th January 1918 Rose (as usual on this trip) early &amp; saw morning coming over Egypt &amp; the grand old Nile.  Seeing Karnak in the moonlight I ask myself how often has she shone down just so for centuries &amp; where are the thousands of beings gone who worshipped there in the long past ages?  Karnak 2 p.m. in garry, &amp; photos taken, watched sunset from top of Pylon &amp; bought scarab ring (&pound;1-14-0) just for association's sake.  9 a.m. went to Luxor temple &amp; all dry caked earth on the ground where in the flood the Nile rises, grand carving &amp; columns.  At night we, S. Hills, Corporal Richards &amp; myself go again to Karnak &amp; sit &amp; think in the age long silence of the place.  Am now a pt. &amp; have food etc. cut up, arm put in sling by C. Richards &amp; all kindly help possible is given.
