<p>April 1915<br/>Thursday 8<br/>Fine day. Entered a well sheltered harbour on the southern coast of the Lemnos Islands. Many ships in this harbour including seven or eight warships &amp; four or five torpedoe &amp; patrol boats. We anchored about 12 P.M . The Queen Elisabeth with her big 15 in. guns is here also the Russian Flagship Askold. A warship has entered the harbour with the top of her stern mast shot off. We are evidently pretty close to the Dardanelles. Many troops are camped on the shore some being the third brigade.</p>
<p>Friday 9<br/>Dull weather. Naval tankship came alongside to give us water. Full marching order parade at 2.40 P.M to practice getting into the boat with full equipment and 200 rounds of ammunition. We are well loaded up. No bully beef issued to us only jam &amp; cheese. We get bread every dinner time. Have to rise at 8 bells or 6 AM.</p>
