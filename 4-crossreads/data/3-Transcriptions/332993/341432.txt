<p>Tuesday May 22. 1917.<br/>There was a lot of rain last night and it continued showery all the morning.<br/>Our Battalion is now out of the trenches.<br/>I am to go down to the Transports this evening.<br/>D. Company had all their rations carried on pack mules today, this is the first time that rations for our Battalion have been so carried.<br/>It is 6 months today since we left Lark Hill Salisbury Plains.<br/>The German casualties according to their own published statements is nearly 4&frac14; millions.<br/>I arrived at the Transports A. L'Epinette about 4.30 this evening.<br/>I cleansed out an old wash house, put a stretcher in and made a bed there, as all the huts are full. It is handy and convenient and much better than in the tents.<br/>There is some very heavy artillery activity this afternoon, between Armentieres &amp; P'loegsteert.<br/>Wednesday May 23. 1917.<br/>It is bright and fine to day. All the rain is gone, and the mud is quickly drying up.<br/>This is the 1024 day of the war. When the war runs 1099 days, if it does run that long, it will be going exactly 3 years, the estimated duration attributed to the late Lord Kitchener.<br/>To day it is 6 months</p>
