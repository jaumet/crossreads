as could be at the finish highly delighted, there were thousands at this match the rivalry was very keen, as it always is between the Battalions the 3rd thought they had us at half time when they were leading by 3 to nil but Lieut Boardman scored 2 brilliant "tries" the mob nearly went frantic hats, sticks, gas bags, all went sky high a terrific roar went up when Donelly converted the first one gave us the lead 5 to 3, you can't imagine the scene when after a pretty bit of passing he raced across the second time put the issue beyond doubt, the whole ground appeared to be a mass of waving hats cheering men, I'll bet they could be heard for miles miles, so ended one of the hardest fought closest games that I have ever seen, for you never knew right up till the last when the 3rd would score for they had a very fine team in the field they played a rattling good game especially a little snowy chap who
