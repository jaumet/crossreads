<p>31/8/18 Halle. Peronne</p>
<p>drew up plans for an attack at 5 a.m. tomorrow morning and our Brigade will assault the Northern Suburbs of Peronne. The 24, 21, 23rd attack and we are in reserve. All my men dug into a high chalky bank and I hope to keep them there all night. Sent up a party of volunteer stretcherbearers to the Gottlieb Tr to clear 5th Bde. wounded. <br/>Roused hell into Sutherland for having returns late at Bde H.Q. The Boche consistently plastered our gully and kept dropping salvoes in it with a monotonous regularity. All these dugouts are on the wrong side and although one is safe enough when right inside the surroundings are dangerous and the doorways are death traps Orders &amp; boundaries were altered and 24 &amp; 23rd were ordered to attack with ourselves &amp; 21st in reserve.</p>
