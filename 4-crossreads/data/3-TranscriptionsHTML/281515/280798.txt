<p>&amp; he marked me Hospital ship Malaria Fever &amp; Dysentry &amp; while I was waiting at the Beach which place I got to somehow meeting Father Murphy on the way down, I got hit on the Head with some small pieces of shrapnel which cut the flesh &amp; glanced off, "Beachy Bill" got 24 with his shot 20 wounded &amp; 4 killed he put it right near where all the men were waiting until the time came for the barge to be loaded for the Hospital ship about 6  in the evening used to be the time when the sick &amp; wounded were taken aboard I was very glad to get on board of the Hospital ship to see everything so nice &amp; clean &amp; to have the first real wash for two months.</p>
<p>The deck I was on was crowded with wounded men &amp; the groans was awful to hear all night long &amp; when I woke next morning feeling much better after a nights sleep in a real bed with sheets I noticed that a lot of the beds were empty, they had died during the night &amp; had gone over the side "a soldiers end"</p>
<p>Well we at last got to Malta &amp; were taken up in Ambulances to St Patricks Hospital where I stopped there about a month &amp; as more men were coming in some of us were sent a convalescent camp at Ian-Taf-Fear [?] about 9 miles from Valetta where we had a good time only roll call at 9 am each morning &amp; as time went on I got another touch of Dysentry &amp; also got yellow jaundice so after this lot I was boarded &amp; recommended for 6 months change to Australia &amp; went on a Hospital ship again to Alexandria &amp; on the way there we received a wireless message from a ship saying she was being chased by a submarine &amp; another message later on was being shelled &amp; sinking</p>
