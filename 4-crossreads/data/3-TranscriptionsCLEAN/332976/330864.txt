May 191725th   This morning the section went out to Fremicourt where a part of No 3 section have been building a heavy bridge.   The bridge is to be constructed over the Nord Canal, (a part of which is still in Fritz's lines) &   We took it to pieces & stacked it ready to be transported up when the opportunity offers.This evening the company held an open air concert in a paddock near by & with the aid of the 20th Divn Band it proved a great success.The good weather still continues & to day has been very warm.
