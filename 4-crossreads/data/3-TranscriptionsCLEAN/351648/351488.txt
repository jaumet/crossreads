The camp I'm in now is some 5 miles behind the front line but batteries surround us, & we occasionally get a shell or two, but we have a good view of everything & can watch the intense shelling that goes on a few miles farther in.  I've never seen anything to equal it, the row at times is simply terrific - Oh! its a damnable war, I'm sick to death of it - all ones friends are getting killed or wounded.
News from Australia has been very scant of late in fact there have hardly been any mails & those only small ones.
Hope John & the nipper are well & that you too flourish.
Best loveJ.B. Metcalfe
