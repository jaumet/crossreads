  
 Nelson & I went to the beach of an island about 3.30 pm - We carried an ancient shot gun with which I secured a pigeon - a fruit pigeon - of a species not known to me & Nelson a shining starling - I took both of these to the Ship & skinned them & made two fair specimens to show Rawdon - Pigeons have their home in this  Australian  region - Also the Shiny Starling - We shot a flying fox which however - we did not recover - Even dead they hang by their hook like claws to the top of a tree. We had a jolly tramp - I saw a screw pine (Pandanus) new to me - It had leaves like an agave of the very darkest bronze green I also got a few fine Polypodies - of the climbing sort.  We went to a village - Saw a native with a stump for an arm - dynamiting fish he said - I saw a native church - the worst in the world - the rudest & crudest - A pulpit only in it made of a few rough boards - nailed together anyhow - The natives sit on mats -
