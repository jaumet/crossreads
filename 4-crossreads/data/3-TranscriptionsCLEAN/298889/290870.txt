 Dear Sir in answer to your letter about the diary, I can honestly tell you that the diary now that is in your possession, is the original that I have carried through with me during the all time I was a Prisoner, and I can tell you that we had an hard job sometimes to  keep our Photo's and diaries, as we was frequently being searched, but by some means or other we used to get to know of these searches, and when they was going to be made, so we had to very often bury our treasures until all was passed a good many lost their Photos & diaries, by not getting them out of sight soon enough, for the Turks would take Post Cards or anything they could lay their hands on, I can bring you witnesses to prove my statement, that I carried that book with me wherever I went, or better still if you can get hold of any of A.E.2,s crew that was with me they will justify my statement, I have a Copy of that same book which I wrote out since my release, giving more details, perhaps you would like that one, if so, I will send it on by Post, but I thought you wanted just the rough and original, this one I have got now explains everything, and I know the other one was written in a terrible hurry at times hoping this will meet with your approval        Yours Truly H.A. Brown
