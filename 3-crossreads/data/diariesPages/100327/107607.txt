Stand to 0430 , Brigadier round Could get no sleep after the carry on. Lovely morning. Aeroplane up but Abduls shooting not as good as usual although he put the white fleecy puff of bursting shells all round the target. Territorial's camp growing at Suvla quite a number of tents on beach and inland about  a mile in among comparatively pleasant surroundings, grass, trees and fairly level country, another camp about battn. probably artillery did not bombard this morning early but have now started searching for artillery Road gun. Shells whizzing very close overhead. Our snipers crept out last night and watched Abdul at work on his trenches.One turk gave himself up to 21st battn-had only one boot.Gave orders all our dead to be buried without boots or any other clothing likely to be of use to those who are left. Siege battery at work from some miles away and landing on Turks trenches just about 200 yards from here with resounding crashes.
The Indians and their mules great workers. The uniform a neat one of khaki; - lithe little men liking Australian very good each man managing three mules and going along these grades at an ambling trot. They must be in good training.
Down fire trench twice shell carried away the sand bags at usual elevated post.Surveyed whole scene carefully through periscope. Trenches running for miles the poor old earth seamed and furrowed and torn about with them. Inspected German officers trench through secret machine gun post using telescope.
Yarning to men along firing the line ? all merry and bright. Evening quiet ? for here. Mail in, a few letters to hand. Essy Bunting's mother enquiring about his death. The funniest thing today was Capt A's `precipitate bolt for any old dugout when Abdul started throwing shells in on the bomb mortar. All hands in rest trenches naked chasing lice
