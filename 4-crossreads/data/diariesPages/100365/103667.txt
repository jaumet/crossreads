Division. These men have a great name are practised men. Having been here for some considerable time actually withdrawn from the Ypres front to come with us.We also have 34 Canadian waggons men attached to us, in place of some we left behind, I can tell you they take some working.However I am left alone have very able assistance in my friend comrade Sgt Turner.I can see we are going to have considerable travelling excitement am very pleased that we have been turned into a Mobile Unit.The weather is still rainy cold, but I verily believe that we are all becoming acclimatised to it, although it is a dag to have to sleep in it. So far I have not lost what little sleep comes my way, but owing to the many hours of daylight, 3am in morning to 10pm at night, one does not get a proper share of same.
