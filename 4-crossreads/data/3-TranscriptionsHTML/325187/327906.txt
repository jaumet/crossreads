<p>Very tired &amp; an aeroplane alarm tried us out again.  3 Taubes during our absence used their Machine Guns &amp; darts on our Camp- but no casualties much.<br/>Thank goodness they did not [bomb] us while we were out so far, a Stampede there &amp; no water 2 WALK home would have Settled many-<br/>There are advantages in my scribble, No censor could read it!!<br/>Had a reply from Mrs Bradden re Billie's fez.  Our men- regretting the L.H were missed as we did not stay long at Mud[r]os after evacuation.  We missed them there &amp; were just too late for the Egypt lot- However our boys have some good stuff coming.</p>
