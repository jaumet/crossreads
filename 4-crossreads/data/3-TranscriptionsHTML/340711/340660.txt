<p>Tuesday, 17.<br/>Caught 3.30pm train from Chatham to Aylesford, wet and gloomy. Saw all at Preston Hall. Stayed at Mrs. Joy's at Aylesford. Very homely and nice. The English of the country have very light teas but heavy suppers.</p>

<p>Friday, 20.<br/>This is the Ward of Serious Sergical cases. Paddy a rale Oirishman, had his leg amputated at the thigh yesterday. He has a nurse watching him night and day. And when they dress him, a doctor is present at each occasion, it is terrible to hear him. Quite half a dozen of the others almost shriek with the pain of dressings.</p>
<p>Saturday, 21.<br/>One poor beggar next me---is an American who crossed the border to enlist. He has most of the right elbow shot away and has to be dressed two or three times a day. He almost faints with pain.</p>
