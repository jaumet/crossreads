Fritz made a fine show of resistance no doubt, but he was absolutely blown out by artillery.  Of all the ground visible for miles in every direction, up and down hill.  There isn't a patch of sound earth.  It resembles the effect of heavy rain on a pool of water.  Aeroplanes, too numerous to count were up today and 22 observation balloons, one occupied by W. Beach Thomas the Daily Mail correspondent.  Fritz can't get even one balloon up, so effective are our planes.
