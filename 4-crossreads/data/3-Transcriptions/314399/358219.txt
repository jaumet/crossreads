<p>Sunday 10 August 1919<br/>A big storm early this morning. A lot of hammocks. blankets &amp; clothing got washed overboard. Had a muster parade in case we had lost a digger but everything was correct. Am on guard again. My hours are 9 to 1 twice. Not at all bad. Bonny breeze all day. Played my tournament game of quoits with my partner. We won fairly easily. I played poorly tho.</p>
