<p>I find the cartridges are all rejects of  Clay Bros, all Brands &amp; Powders.  Egyptian Storekeepers are Robbers- I had to get a Permit from the Consul to buy them-<br/>Today I shot<br/>10 Jack Snipe<br/>1 Duck<br/>3 Plover<br/>3 Big Brown Doves<br/>5 Quail<br/>&amp; nearly drownded a young native getting the Duck.  Wish I had my good gun this "made in Germany" is only Goopipe &amp; very old &amp; very cheap.<br/><strike>Just heard the news re ROUMANIA joining in &ndash; Good luck to her   We will all be home by Xmas- you see</strike></p>
