  
 and we sail on the Navua at 3.30 pm change money on board into English & settle down for the voyage  weather good poor accomedation for men 800 odd on a ship of 2,900 Tons 
 Next day.   Weather good so far & good Ki Ki for the Troops, in Touch with Eastern by Wireless 
 Sunday [Feb 7th] weather still good no church services but have life belts on & stand to stations, the steward in my cabin was on the Empress of Ireland when she was run down by another ship & sank he told me he took time & put his life belt on properly & right up tight under the arms, I have a pistol loaded & given to me & on the alarm sounding I have to keep everybody rushing the life boats as we have only room for about 400 men & we are over 800 & have orders to kill if anybody rushes the boats 
 Monday the weather is rather rough & some of the boys are looking green & are rather quiet  wonder why ? 
 Tuesday Weather worse the Navua is a splendid sea boat she does not roll a bit, but she mounts a wave & seems to halt for a minute & then dives down, a most pleasing feeling, then she mounts another & does the same     she is slow now only doing 7 knots as the propellor is out of the water half the time
