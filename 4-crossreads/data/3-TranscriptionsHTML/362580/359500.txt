<p>friend was supposed to have rung up on Wednesday but failed to do so &ndash; Anyhow he may be coming to Cairo soon &amp; then I shall see him again.  I have just written to Mrs McCallum &amp; the Osburnes.</p>
<p>I have not been able to trace poor old Keith yet but I think he may be at Heliopolis, so I shall soon find him then.  Captain Main said he had a fractured leg &amp; a few scratches caused by a bomb, but glad to say nothing to worry over.  He left Anzac on 7.10.15 &amp; I only received the letter Friday, which was sent that day.  It is very hard indeed to trace the sick &amp; wounded, so many different hospitals &amp; no one knows where they are sent to.</p>
<p>I'm hoping there will be heaps of letters waiting for me at The Palace so shall not finish this until I have returned to the hospital.</p>
