 Have been salvaging rifles, overcoats, box respirators, P.H. Helmets, picks shovels ammunition, bombs, magazines for Lewis guns, steel helmets, and dozens of useful articles today - &amp; every day. - There are thousands of pounds worth of salvage lying everywhere. We buried a few Germans &amp; one of our own unknown men - apparently killed here and partly buried by shells over a month ago. 
 Our dugout is inside a room of an old farm which has been blown to pieces on top of dugout, thus forming a good head cover. An old German dugout in which they once had electric lights. 
 The trenches are very smelly &amp; sloppy in many places. 
 Capt Browning arrived last night (O.C. &quot;C&quot; Coy) Major Marks - arrived today.
