<p>9th Nov 1917. When at 11am we fell in in marching order and marched two miles to the village of Halle. Here we boarded motor lorries which had brought down other troops and were taken through Fauquembergues, Wizernes and Hazebrouck nearly to Neuf Berguin From here we marched through darkened Neuf Berguin in the dark and rain to Dolilieu, a village about half way between Bailleul and Merville. Here we occupied our old billets in the barns.</p>
<p>10th and 11th Nov. Remained at Doulieu<br/>12th Nov. We marched from Doulieu to the camp now a divisional rest station at Pont d'Achelles , on the Bailleul-Nieppe road. Here we stayed for a month during the whole of which time the dental orderly was away ill in hospital and I was called upon to take his place. We worked in one end of a large Nissen hospital hut and there was no lack of patients. I was free after tea at 4.30 pm each evening, and sometimes walked to Steenwerck and Nieppe with cobbers to see Pierrot shows or the movies.</p>
