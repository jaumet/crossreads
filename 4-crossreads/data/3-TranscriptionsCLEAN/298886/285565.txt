  
 Camp of the ill fated "A" Squadron of the Worcester Yeomanry and the 2/2 Company of the 52nd Lowland DIVISION Royal Engineers who were caught napping by the Turks on either the 23rd or 25th of April last. Not one single man has yet returned to tell how it all happened. But it is very plainly evident to us who have seen the place what  has  happened. And that is that the Turks surprised those two units in the early morning of either of the above mentioned dates and rushed the Camp  Hand to hand fighting of a desperate character must have ensued which is proved by the fact that many skulls are fractured dozens of helmets lay about and there is scarcely one that has not been either penetrated by a bullet or has been stove in probably by the butt end of a rifle. The dead are only just covered over with loose sand and the uniforms can be distinguished Some of them almost exposed on the surface. Documents of every conceivable description also books of referance and records are strewn about in great confusion The valuable articles have of course  not  been taken away by the Turks or have been looted by roving bands of Bedouin Arabs. 
 Truly our soldiers know how to die game whatever else may be said about them.
