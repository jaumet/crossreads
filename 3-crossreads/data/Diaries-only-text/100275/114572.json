it in right away, but our chaps are fighters in every sense of the word
In this battle I had more narrow escapes than all the others put together one bullet cut my puttee nearly in half just grazed the skin I was saved 3 times by my steel helmet had 2 holes in my equipment good enough wasn't it.
We moved from our billets this morning evening, had a stiff march of 11 miles, down a hard metal road didn't our feet ache, when we reached our destination we were dog tired.
29th. This morning we moved off again, it was very hot the sun fairly beamed down
