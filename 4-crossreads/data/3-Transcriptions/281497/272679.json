<p>9th. This morning we packed up &amp; moved off from Halloy-Pernois toward the firing line, it was a scorching hot morning, &amp; the dust was something awful far worse than the marching which was quite stiff enough for anyone.</p>
<p>We passed a lot of our artillery, &amp; the 5th Brigade on the way back they did not get the cutting up we did, we had a good long spell on the grass while the Artillery passed us.</p>
<p>We are now in billets about 6 miles from Halloy.</p>
<p>Received quite a budget of letters yesterday, &amp; Gretas photo among them how she has changed.</p>
