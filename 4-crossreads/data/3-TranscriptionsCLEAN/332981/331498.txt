  
 Like Lee, Cronje was in want of food, and the last ham which the British Staff could produce was sacrificed in his honour. 
 Today Monday November 11th is a day of great expectation, & there is a lot of rumours about, Germany has to give an answer to the Allies. "Yes or No" which means Surrender, the rumour is at present moment, time 11 am, that Germany has accepted the allies terms & there is great rejoicing in the Camp. The paper will be anxiously waited for further news. 
 I am off duty for the day but the weather is cold and threatening & I intended going into the township of Rue about 6 miles from here, but I will remain in camp instead.
