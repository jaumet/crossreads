<p>Wednesday 28 June 1916<br/>Still showery in the morning. In the strafe of yesterday evening the brother of Major Watson who came over as a private in the 14th of the 2nd was killed. I wished to attend his funeral &amp; to find out particulars had to ride up to Sailly on a bike to see Major Watson, by no means a pleasant ride in the rain &amp; over slushy rough roads. Came back to supports for lunch &amp; at 4.30 had to ride up again to Sailly cemetry, but owing to an alteration in the time just missed the service. Rested for a while &amp; then bought some lovely strawberries to bring back to the mess &amp; en route called in to see Leo for a minute or two &amp; reached home at 7 p.m. About midnight 2 very severe bombardments in front of us.</p>
