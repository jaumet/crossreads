  
 Out in the Desert 20-6-1917 
 Dear Aunt Just a few lines to let you know that I am well and I trust you are both the same. Well I can tell you that it is getting very hot here now and the flys are very bad and the dust at times is awful. Well I expect to get some mail any day now. It is the only thing to look forward to here. 
 We have been getting up at three oclock every morning for this last fortnight except when we get up earlier, we left camp yesterday morning at three and got home again half past nine in the night, we never had our saddles off our horses or they never had a drink and it is very hot to and we was galloping about some of the time, I can tell you I was very tired when we got back to Camp, you have no idea off the load of gear we have to carry with us, and we have only a small water bottle to take with us, I often wish I had brought a good water bag with me, as it is impossible to buy one here. I wrote and asked Nell to send me a big one. 
 The dust is dredfull to day. I see Mr. Finlay every day, he is well liked by the men. Do you know I only recieved one of Nells letters last week that was written on March 14th it was just three months to the day getting here. But I have recieved all the rest very good. 
 My word we do some long hours at times when out on some of the Stunts they go on, the poor horses have a fairly rough time of it on those jobs, as it is not safe to ever take your saddles off, but you would be surprised how well the most of them look. I have a very nice horse just at the present time. The horse Levi Treasure brought over with him is in the same troop as I am in, he broke her in when working at Stevensons. 
 There are a lot of chaps here from around Kojonup & Katanning
