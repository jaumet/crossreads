 and you need not to be frightened of darling Lorna catching cold i only wish this war had finished in time for me to have got home i bet i would have give you all a lively time but never mind i done my bit to get it finished and by the time you get this note i will be in at them again and we will have it finished and home for Easter i hope. There is only one thing i want you to do for me and that is to give the children and yourself a good time but them anything they want for my sake. 
 From your ever loving Husband Tom
