<p>Walked about 1 &frac14; mile. Dorothy, Sister O'Dwyer   &amp;  self &ndash; one of the sledges is for us but we went of theirs, ours was not quite right.</p>
<p>We three had a glorious time but it was too short, had to hurry back to duty. Have not been able to go since, we are fearfully busy. The sick are simply crowding in   &amp;  we cannot Evacuate quick enough, trains very busy.</p>
