Hamelet & Corbie, & at La Neuville got a lorry to Daours. It stopped there, & after a while I got one to Rivery & arrived about 9 p.m. I turned in at 10.30. feeling none too like a big stunt, as I vomited what I had for tea again.7 Aug.Five of us set off on our long trip up to Bn. this morning. We got separated, the traffic on the road is simply enormous, lorries in thousands, & it is going to be a tremendous stunt. We got a lift up the road as far as an  ambulance car was going & walking along blowed if I didn't strike Cobcroft sitting by the wayside. He is a Lieutenant in the 1st Bn. - the 1st Division has just come down south after a long stay on the northern French front. He was asking after Boo. Finally, after various terms of walking, a ride on a different transport, I arrived a Vaire where the B'n are. All issues, rations, bombs, etc. are being completed in preparation for the great stunt to be launched tomorrow.   A letter from General Monash was read, saying it was the first time the whole of the 5 Australian Divisions have gone into battle together, & the biggest thing they have yet been in. A Canadian Corps will be on one flank of us & 2 English Divisions on the other, & tanks, aeroplanes & artillery will be in a colossal scale. Lt. Parsonage explained the part our platoons of D Coy have to take. Oh well, one can only trust in Providence. Our Vaire Wood & Hamel stunt on 4th July will be a baby to this. The weather is fine today, it's hard to realise it's the eve of a very big battle. I got my gear ready at 8 p.m., then read Boo's letter & the "Daily Mail". Early in the morning, hell will be let loose. Had a lie down in my clothes at 9 p.m., & had a snooze till 1 a.m., when we had breakfast.Thursday 8 Aug.At 2 a.m. we
