 Dear George, 
 We are in Huts over here. We only have 20 in a Hut that would accommodate 35. Most of the Boys are sitting round the fire. It is not a scrap cold but without the fire it would be Cool. We get very poor grub, not enough I mean. sugar is 6d a lb & eggs about 4d each so  we get only a little bit of the former in our food & the suppers at the TMCA are 1/6 and too dear too. I want all my money for the travelling so I have to do as the Doctors advise. Always feel able to eat another meal when finished one. I have no news to tell so am only writing cards. We are still in Details but any day may go to our Hospital. We are all in [indecipherable] Health & Hope you are all the time.  Harry.
