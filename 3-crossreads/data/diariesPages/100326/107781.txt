27/9/15 as if their information is faulty. Quite satisfied that most of their shells did very little if any damage, and if they killed wounded a dozen or so it is very small game for the cost of ammunition.
Later. They tried very persistently to knock out the guns on the next rise to us but cannot succeed. The big gun doing this is about 5 miles away and we see the shells going through the air with their "whiz" if you are lucky enough to get sight at the right moment. No uniform in the trenches, the dress very nondescript in character. We were inclined to resent leaving our helmets behind but the Australian felt hat is the best for over here besides giving us the distinctive Australian look, which our men cultivate not wanting to be confused with Kitchener's weaklings. Caps worn a good deal. The wire pulled out of the crown which causes the cap to collapse into a soft shapeless mass which is comfortable and does not reflect the light. Tunics with web equipment always on. Shorts bare legs, perhaps socks and a pair of boots. In hot weather the dress from waist up naked, pair short khaki trunks pair boots cap. Most have beards and unwashed look like toughs from Collingwood. Everyone full of jokes and fun. Diarrhoea one of our chief troubles caused by the hard tinned food and the flies. Chronic with most men weakening. Everyone wears mosquito net round the hat, dyed by soaking it in tea for invisibility
Aeroplanes above reconnoitring. Very noisy
