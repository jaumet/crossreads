October
Turkey are threatened to be destroyed by the advance of our troops in that region.

The Imperial Chancellor of Germany has resigned owing to the Bulgarian situation.

The Kaiser has had to form a new ministry, The Socialists are now in power in Germany with Prince Max of Baden at the Head. This is the first time in the History of the German Parliament that Socialists have been in power.

My only wish now is that the news of Turkey’s surrender will come along.

I hope they succeed in smashing her the same as they have done Bulgaria, Then I do not think it will be long before Austria-Hungary throws down her arms, and so bring Germany to her knees, But somehow I think Germany will give in before our troops get to Germany to smash plans about like the Huns did in France.

If we can only keep advancing as we have done since Germany’s last offensive of last Spring, It will not be long before we achive the long sought Peace
