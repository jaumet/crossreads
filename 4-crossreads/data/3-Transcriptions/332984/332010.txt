<p>14.11.1916   Fearful bombardment, Bty getting shelled, had to leave guns.  Good progress made yesterday 600 yards gained, and still advancing 3,000 prisoners captured yesterday.  General Birdwood highly delighted.  A frightful, but grand sight occurred this evening at 3 oclock, a sheet of flame shot out of the clouds, and fell straight to earth.  Similar to a huge rocket.  I believe it was one of our aeroplanes.  The day was foggy.  All the 1st Division Infantry relieved.  Terrible slaughter, not an inch of ground without shell holes.  Dead, both German and British lying everywhere.  Guns, wagons, horses, and men blown to atoms, Thousands of rounds off all sorts of ammunition strewn about.  One part in particular is pleasing, 2 monster Howitzers(Huns) one mass of scrap iron.</p>
