Steve Smith came in last night and his list of losses is awful. 28 officers 706 men killed wounded Curnow Mackay killed and my splendid lads all broken up. Curnow was a brother to me and the news was a shock. Yeadon also said to be dead. We shall never see the like of these chaps again. Does God laugh?

Warm dull day. The weather is keeping very dry and London has been some time without rain. My expected uniform did not arrive so perforce had to remain hanging about indoors in dressing gown and slippers.

Went out with Bazeley Lt Ross and took ?bus to Lambeth Bridge. Interesting ride on top of the ?bus. London an enormous cruel dingy place. Saw the Life Guard sentries Picadilly Circus and had lunch at the Regent. Struck by the women drinking ?pots" their smoking and the cult of the dog instead of the baby. Went out to Hampton Court, being Friday the picture galleries were closed but we saw the fine grounds the sunken garden, the King's Garden, Anne Boleyns Walk and then went to the Maze which we penetrated with ease remembering the rule. Keep to the left every turn except the first two which take to the right. Waterfront very pretty. Returned Clapham Junction then Taxi home. Expenses for day 8/2
