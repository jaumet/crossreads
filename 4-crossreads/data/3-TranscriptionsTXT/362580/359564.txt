dreadfully sorry for them.  He is such a nice, clever boy & has had so many drawbacks.  It is a pity they have no more children.
I got a dreadful shock to hear of Mrs. Weir's death.  It is very, very sad to think that two young mothers have left each a little family of 5 children.  Funny they lived next door to each other.  Terang will be a very sad place.
I'm so pleased to hear that you are all better from the Influenza.  See that you all take care of yourselves & not get fresh colds.  I had such a number of letters from my Vic. friends.
Ethel's & Miss Dot. Swinburne's came on Friday - Ella & Doll's, Emma's, Mrs. Osburne's & Miss Newland's I got Monday afternoon.  It will just tell you how the mails are sorted here.
Thank you Al. for good-wishes & your letter arrived the day after my birthday.  I'm glad to hear all my debts have been settled - now I hope Belle will, fix up the money for the birthday presents
