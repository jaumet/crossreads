they seem to think that planes can be more usefully employed in bombing they are both pretty right, there were constant streams of our planes passing back forth last night on the same game as old Fritz, I'll bet many an old Fritz had the "wind up" as he anxiously listened for the hum of our planes wondered what the night would bring forth. At the present time the Hun is dropping 2 different sorts of bombs, one of them acts more like a big shell, blows great craters in the ground that you could easily put a house in, this bomb is used more for destroying dumps, guns, roads, railways, etc. the other bomb has an instantaneous fuze which bursts the instant it touches anything, it is a very heavy terrible powerful bomb, it only makes a hole big enough to put a bucket in, but as for doing damage to troops horses it is second to none, for it bursts into thousands of small pieces these all keep very low, about 3 ft high, so that one is far safer standing up
