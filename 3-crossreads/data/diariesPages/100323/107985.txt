9/9/19 Sydney
Wet morning. Walked round Pitt Castlereagh George Sts and booked opera seats at Palings to saw MacGowan re lunch. All men seem well dressed including working class and their clothes are clean. Narrow footways verandas.Visited Horderns and other "sights". Went to Faust.

Fine. Went over to Manly and had a look round getting a good toss going across the harbour. No one surfing too cold. Fine long breakers. Back to hotel dinned and then went to a matinee of "Madame Butterfly" with plump Amy Castles in the title role. Met MacGowan in the evening and went out to dinner with him at his very nice place and family at Hunters Hill. Beautiful lights on the water at 11 pm returning.
