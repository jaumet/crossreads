<p>by Australian Lady Volunteers where you can get a cup of Cocoa &amp; Cakes for a few piastres.  It is quite nice to hear them speak the good old language as one gets tired of all the jargoes you get here.<br/>It seems to be certain that we will shift by the 15th of this month, so we are all looking forward to it.</p>
<p>6.3.16 Monday  7.3.16 Tuesday<br/>Two days of heavy transport work &amp; very little time to spare.<br/>To-day we took over 7 more wagons &amp; also 16 Horses &amp; 34 Mules.  These Mules would kick the eye out of a needle &amp; they want watching, although they are great workers.  They come from Peru &amp; Argentine mainly and are of a very large size.<br/>I think I am doomed as regards my Commission for there has been some more leg pulling &amp; strangers are getting the Commissions.  This fact is filling me with discontent &amp; I will be very pleased when I can get into plain clothes &amp; leave the life behind me.</p>
