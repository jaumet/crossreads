At BeutinI am feeling rather blue today for I have been thinking about home; however we must not allow such beautiful thoughts to hinder our minds and spirits.Went in company with the tall James, to the cinema, and enjoyed the programme - fully. Five large and long pictures.Old Dick looks pretty fit.Weather fine and warmer than usual.
