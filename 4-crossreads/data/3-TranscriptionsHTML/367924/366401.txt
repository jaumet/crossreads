<p>His duty nobly done.<br/>[Photograph]</p>
<p>In proud and loving memory of<br/>My dear nephew<br/>Trooper William Victor Weaber<br/>Died of wounds in Egypt<br/>June 7th., 1918.<br/>Aged 37 years</p>
<p>No pen can write no tongue can tell<br/>What he went through when he lay ill;<br/>To God alone his pains were known,<br/>He loved him best and took him home.</p>
<p>There are griefs that cannot find comfort<br/>And wounds that cannot be healed,<br/>There are sorrows so deep in our hearts<br/>That cannot be half revealed.</p>
<p>Often my thoughts do wander<br/>To a grave so dear to me,<br/>Where a noble hero true and brave,<br/>Peacefully sleeps in a soldier's grave.</p>
<p>Deeply Mourned.<br/>&ndash; Inserted by his loving parents.</p>
