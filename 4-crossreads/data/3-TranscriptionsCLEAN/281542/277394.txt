Petrograd, Oct 4.The Russian Minister at Sofia has been ordered to hand to Dr. Radoslavoff, President of the Council, the following note:-
"Events are happening in Bulgaria which show the final resolve of the Government of King Ferdinand to place the fate of the country in the hands of the Germans.  The presence of German and Austrian officers in the Ministry of War and on the Headquarter Staff, the concentration of troops in the zone abutting on Servia, the substantial financial assistance accepted by the Bulgarian Cabinet from our enemies:  all these admit of no further doubt as to the object of the present military preparations of the Bulgarian Government.  The Entente Powers, who have at heart the realization of the aspirations of the Bulgarian people, have many times warned Dr. Radoslavoff that any hostile act against Servia would be considered to be hostile to the Entente Powers.  The prodigal assurances given by the Bulgarian Minister in reply to these warnings are contradicted by the facts.  The representative of Russia, tied to Bulgaria by the imperishable memory of the latter's liberation from the Turkish yoke, cannot sanction by his presence agressive fratricidal preparations against an allied Slav people.  Consequently the Russian Minister has received orders to leave Bulgaria with all his Staff and Consuls, if within 24 hours the Bulgarian Government does not openly break with the enemies of the Slav cause and of Russia and does not take immediate steps to remove officers belonging to the armies of the States which are at war with the Entente Powers."
Oct 8.The Bulgarian reply to the Russian note not being considered satisfactory, diplomatic relations have been broken off.  The British, French, Italian and Servian Ministers in Sofia have demanded their passports.
