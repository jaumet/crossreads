April 24th 8.30 a.m. Mudros Bay
I got a most pleasant surprise this a.m. at breakfast.  The Captain handed me a letter from home & it is the first I have received since leaving Australia.  As we have just got instructions to depart for the Dardanelles in 3 hours time, I am very pleased, especially as it contains good advice.  Had a few Australian Soldiers aboard last night & we gave them a real good time.11.40 a.m.  Left Anchorage in the Bay & are now bound to the North West corner of Lemnos Island, where we will arrive at 4 p.m. & anchor till 11 p.m. when we proceed to the Dardanelles arriving at daylight & we then start the business of getting our Troops, Horses & Guns etc ashore on the open beach of the Gallipoli Peninsula, by means of Lighters barges etc.
Anchored at the N.W. end of Lemnos Island 4.30 p.m. There are twelve Troopships at this spot at present & 5 Men' o' War.  At 11 p.m. tonight we are to put all lights out & proceed to an allotted anchorage off the Gallipoli Peninsula, where we have got to arrive at 5 a.m. on Sunday April 25th.  Meanwhile, from 3 to 5 a.m., the Battleships are to land 1500 men, then 7 Destroyers (Beagle, Bulldog, Foxhound, Scourge, Colne, Cheliner & Ribble) rush in & land 400 men each & four Troopships, ourselves
