 On reaching the town, we marched through the Govt. offices portion then down the main St. Adderley St where we were well received and back to the ship. It was a change to se the city as it was the suburbs which we had on Sunday &amp; Monday been through &amp; which struck me as being curious. There are in the city some very fine &amp; modern looking buildings and the whole place seemed busier &amp; more modern than what I originally thought. During the march which was rather hilly we felt, at times, rather tired but we did the about 12 miles all right &amp; with sleeves rolled we must have looked well. 
 Wednesday 21st Left ship for march 10.15 and went to  common  "Common" by a different route past the Hospital and fort. We had 2 hours to ourselves there &amp; indulged  to  in having the lunch we brought  to  together with soft drinks, bananas oranges &amp; biscuits. Bought oranges to bring aboard ship and then we marched through the city &amp; back to the ship about 4 p.m. We had a good reception through the city &amp; after watching niggers coaling until about 5 pm we cast off and with the assistance of a tug cleared the wharves went out into the bay where the Medic &amp; Demosthenes we awaiting us. The Warilda which had arrived early today soon followed. We all anchored in the Bay. 
 Thursday 22nd With Medic, Warilda Demosthenes &amp; H.M.S. "Laconia" we cleared port about 8 am &amp; with fine weather &amp; a good swell said Good-bye to Cape Town &amp; started Part II of our voyage.
