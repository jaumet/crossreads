I said before that this is a quiet little place, there seem to be very few civilians here, and also few troops, we can only hear the guns at times, and then very faintly, I am not sorry, for I was just about tired of them, up where we were, they were all round us, and they were seldom silent for long. and about two hundred yds from my last camping place a heavy battery used to make night hideous at times, they seemed to take a delight in opening up suddenly, I guess fritz used to say things that would not stand printing about that Battery, but that would not worry them, any. I have not told you yet what I'm doing, down here, so had better do so now ere I forget I'm being educated, some more, and at the same time having a spell, I wish that they would send to a school where I could learn to Parley Francais, 'twould be exceedingly useful, and much easier than trying to study the Lingo alone, "I tried that method but it's a failure, you just get a start, someone comes along and wants to know what you're doing, then gives a little advice, about paying the M.O. a visit, then leaves you, someone else arrives, makes the usual inquiries passes various remarks, about your mental apparatus etc and so the game goes on. when you have had enough you rise, stuff your book into your pack and then go for a walk, or go outside and tell them how you would have enlisted very much earlier had you known the war was going to last such a long time, and the life was going to prove so very interesting
