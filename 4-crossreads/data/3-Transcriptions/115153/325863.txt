<p>Now a month had passed and we were to go back to our respective units again, and we were relieved by another batch of men who were to go a course at the School. On account of the Germans still retreating beyond Bapaume, the motor lorries which were engaged in transport work, were very busy and consequently we had to march back to our units on foot. We marched to Coutay, a distance of about 15 miles, on the first day and put up in a farmer's hayloft for the night. I shall never forget this particular night as we were constantly disturbed by big rats that kept rustling through the hay and occasionally scrambling across our bodies. In the morning we had a good wash and a good feed and started again on our journey.</p>
<p>We marched through several Villages until we came to Albert when each batch of men broke away in the direction of their respective units. Our Battalion was only 3 miles from Albert and we arrived there in time for tea and to get our mail which had accumulated for the month while we were away.</p>
<p>While at this camp, called Cecourt Camp, we saw what was left of the 4th division returning after having had a very heavy loss of men in the consequence of trying to reach the Hindenburg line in daylight. Out of the whole division there were only a few hundred men returning, and they looked very much dead-beaten, with their clothes all jagged with the results of scrambling through barbed wire.</p>
<p>From this camp we were ordered up to the trenches, which were 15 miles distant. We left on one wet morning marching across the muddy fields until we came to Bapaume Road, and on reaching Bapaume we had a rest and something to eat, after which we marched a few miles further to reserve trench line where we took up a position for three days. While in this reserve line we had a commanding view of areas that were being shelled heavily, but we were not troubled much in that respect. The Battalion for which we were standing in reserve had great success, and they despatched batches of prisoners back to the cages the whole three days we were there.</p>
<p>The prisoners were a study to look at, and they looked as though they had had enough of war, some were wounded and some were very exhausted looking.</p>
