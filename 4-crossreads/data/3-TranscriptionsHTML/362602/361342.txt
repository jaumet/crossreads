<p>present at a send-off at Brookvale.  We are very shorthanded &amp; it will leave too much work for the other fellows if we take our leave from tomorrow (Wednesday) so we will wait till the other chaps come back before we come home.  You will tell the Brookvale people about this as I have not seen the letter.  Well trusting to see you well on Friday night I will close.  Billy &amp; Ellis will not be home till late Sunday night &amp; I have to be back here on Sunday night at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Well Au Revoir<br/>Harry</p>
