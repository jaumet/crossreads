<p>There is another free issue of beer this afternoon, I don't know who is shouting for it</p>
<p>Went over with a lot more today to get the idea of sending &amp; taking signals from the aeroplanes, we had smoke bombs to show them our position &amp; flappers, white on one side &amp; dark on the other to signal with in dull weather &amp; a big piece of tin, black on side &amp; shiny on the other for sunny weather, the aeroplane's picked us up alright, they signal to us with a sort of glorified horn, &amp; when they want to know where we are they drop colored lights, when we see these lights</p>
