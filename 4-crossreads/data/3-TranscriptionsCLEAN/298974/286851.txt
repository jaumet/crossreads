 I have had two feed of steak  eggs! I went to a "Butcherie" (note French)  asked for 'steak sil vous plait",  the dame said "steak finish". I went to go, but a youth who was in the know asked for "fillet please",  got a lovely junk. So I sent a good looking pal up  he again asked for fillet  please . And then we dined. Oh! It was simply, great. The prices tho' are awful. They have special prices for Australians. 
 I spent an evening with Les Wynne  Bob Newton tother eve. Bob is about 7 feet high Les looked very well  is a Sgt now. Pattern has left the Battalion. I also met LeO Howard, so, you see I've been raking up old pals. It's good I can tell you.
