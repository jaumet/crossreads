<p>Saturday 7 June 1919<br/>Came out to Alice's place &amp; had brekker. Ern. went in to meet me but we missed one another. Went to Queens Park in the afternoon &amp; in the evening just went for a stroll. It rained in the afternoon after being a little bit dusty.</p>
<p>Sunday 8 June 1919<br/>Went to the baths &amp; had a swim. Gee it was good. Do me. After lunch we went round to Paisley &amp; came home via Ruther Glen. Gee the place is beautifully green. Like it all much better. After we came home Ern. &amp; I went into town to post a couple of letters. Of course it rained again.</p>
