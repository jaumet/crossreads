Rather pretty scenery here, tropical; but it is rather hot. No leave is granted here because of fever. Have run to date 3165 miles.

Saw the blue miasma mist rising off the land this morning; they say that it is as deadly as poison gas to a white man. We took in fresh water; and the natives came alongside selling fruit etc. Then the convoy sailed at 5.P.M. with the light cruiser "Kent" as escort; this cruiser played a part in the destruction of Von Spee's squadron. The niggers here are a fine stamp physically; they paint texts on the sides of their canoes and chant hymns. Evidently religious.

Guess we crossed the equator yesterday. Weather is very hot. There was some gun practice in the convoy today at a target towed by our cruiser escort.
