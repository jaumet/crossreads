Rumour has it, "we shall not call at Fremantle", because a German raider is supposed to be hovering about the Australian Coast. Over 2000 soldiers are packed into the holds of the "Suevic", most of them are sea sick.

<p>June 25th:-<br/>Life belts <strike>were</strike> issued today. The 20th Reinforcements of the 20th Battalion <strike>were</strike> selected to be the armed guard of the life boats in case of panic. It is known definitely that we shall not put in to Fremantle, much to the dis<strike>s</strike>appointment of all ranks.</p>
