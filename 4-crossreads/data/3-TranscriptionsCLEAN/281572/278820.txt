  
 everybody says is very pretty.  A little while ago the 35 mumps cases were sent off.  Very hard luck for the lads who in some cases have brothers remaining on board.  Coaling is in full swing & we are no doubt going out to day. 
 We left Fremantle yesterday Wed 30th at 5 p.m.  The people along the streets all cheered us and all the ships cock-a-doodle-dooed.  A young girl has been semaphore signalling from the wharf all day.  She signals with very clear angles and the lads are sending messages back from three or four parts of the boat at once.  Just what she sees in spending her days signalling to men on troop ships I cant see, but she is a well known identity here, and was at the same game when the "Orsova"  A67 was in this part 13 months ago.  She gives her name as Dulcie, and by jove she wont stand any nonsense.  She concluded with "God speed, look out for me when you return. I'm always here" . 
 This is one of the most perfect days (Sunday 3rd Sep.'16) I have ever experienced at sea.  We are of course well south of the course we took last time when we made for Suez, and only an occasional Albatros and Flying fish is seen.  The big lazy roll of the ocean, and the Indian Ocean is a beautiful ocean to me, gives us all a dreadfully lazy feeling.  It makes me think of Leigh Hunt's "A Now" where he so brilliantly puts on paper the little peculiarities of the "great vulgar"  on a hot enervating day. This is not a hot day, it is a real Manly Autumn day, but there is a balancing force in the effect of this great oceans weary swell. 
 The Sergeants have a deck to themselves and I wish you could see them all now.  Some are fast asleep (its 3.30 p.m.) in the most fantastic positions, for the deck is Oh so hard, and sleep was ever a great leveller.  The Provost Sergeant (Bennett) was in such a beautiful attitude that Lockrey & I photographed him.  I wish I could develop it.
