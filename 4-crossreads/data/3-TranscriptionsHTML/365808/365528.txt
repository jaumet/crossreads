<p>No 60492</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE<br/>MELBOURNE AUG 21 1917</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Justice Ferguson,</p>
<p>With reference to my letter of 23 rd July last, relative to three letters despatched to South Africa in an endeavour to have them delivered to Lieut. Keith Ferguson at Durban, I have to inform you that a cablegram has just been received from Capetown saying that these letters arrived at Durban too late to catch Lieut. Ferguson. They are being returned to this Department and on receipt in Melbourne will be immediately returned to you. I am sorry<br/>Yours Sincerely,<br/>[indecipherable]<br/>His Honor,<br/>The Hon. D.G. Ferguson,<br/>Judges Chambers,<br/>Supreme Court,<br/>Sydney, N.S.W.</p>
