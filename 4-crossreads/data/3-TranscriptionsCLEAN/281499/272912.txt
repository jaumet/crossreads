heavy howitzers were falling fast scattering death & destruction everywhere.  I crawled out towards their barb wire & slipped into a shell hole & tried to bandage my wound   I was covered with mud from head to foot & a fair bit of blood was coming away from me, in a few minutes time the remnants had rallied & Capt. Jackson was leading them out he walked as calmly & as cooly among the bullets as if he were on parade & called on the men to follow him for the honour of the Battalion they responded nobly but what could men do in such boggy ground & against such overwhelming numbers, it is a fact that wounded men have been trying to get out from the firing line & have been found with just their head & shoulders out & a ticket round their necks, dead as a door nail, too weak to struggle
