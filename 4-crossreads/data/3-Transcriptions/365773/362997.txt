<p>England<br/>4.3.19<br/>Two very nice letters from you yesterday of December date, so pleased you &amp; Beres liked the cards etc I sent you. I am still patiently waiting for my boat to sail, it is now booked for the 16th so should go this month at least, I have been in camp now for over a month waiting &amp; can't get on a boat. I am now definitely on one &amp; should go on her barring accidents.</p>
