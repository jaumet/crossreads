26/2/19 Marcinelle
A varied morning spent rambling round the billets and yarning with different people. I saw Turner's people and found him well dug in. Visited the Transport and quite a lot of horses have now been sold off. Had a yarn with Mdlle Anna and Madame Marcelle Bertrand. Afternoon I spent reading until 5 pm when I went to the Berlitz school and had a good lesson in French from a young girl locked up in an overheated room that, in characteristic fashion, smelt strongly of human perspiration. From here went to the Hotel Sierbertz where James was given a rousing farewell at a mess dinner. I made a small speech. After went straight home passing several sad ships passing in the night.
