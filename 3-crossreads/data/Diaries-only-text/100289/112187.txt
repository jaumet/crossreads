stretcher. Cannot keep your feet while walking alone. Relieved at midnight.
Tuesday 24.10.16
Arrived back at 5 Am from furthest post practically exhausted, cannot keep your feet a second; slept till 11 Am Sent out to furthest post again at night; never before experienced such an awful night, five of a part of 8 I had with me broke up. Fritz sniped a stretcher party of us with High explosive shells; had to take stretcher all in a sap for shelter.
Relieved at 12, back at base 3.30 AM. Blistered heels through feet being constantly wet. Covered in mud from head to foot sopping wet. Quiet a picture of beauty. Lots of the boys knocking up.
