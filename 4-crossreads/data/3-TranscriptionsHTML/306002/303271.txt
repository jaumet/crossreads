<p>29.8.15<br/>places.  I was feeling particularly good this morning &amp; went to the Church Service;  &amp; went on duty at Hintons Post at 12 oclock.  This afternoon we had a naval Officer here taking bearings &amp; range finding;  the Turks have been busy every night for some considerable time now building up some earth works at the top of Popes Gully &amp; as the building is now getting a considerable heights the Heads appear to think it is time to knock them down again, our Artillery opened fire on it this morning with high explosive shells but did not appear to do much damage to the work, they have come to the conclusion that the work is being built up with cement &amp; the warboats are going to make a target of it tonight.  Mack is on duty on this outpost tonight.</p>
