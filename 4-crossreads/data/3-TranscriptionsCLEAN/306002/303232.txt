21.7.15Wed. 21st.  At 8 o'clock this morning we left Popes Hill & came on to Walkers Ridge & had to take over the 'Phone (which is only a few yards from the outpost) straight away.  C Sqd. is camped up the ridge from the gully where A & B Sqd. are camped, it is not the safest place in the world as large shells fall there occasionally.  We have to carry gas helmets with us always now & everything points as if we are likely to get a taste of it soon, messages keep constantly coming through the 'phone for sentries etc. to keep a sharp look out for any signs of it.  Heard a message coming through that a destroyer would open fire during the night & the Talbot (destroyer) would also open fire at 4.30 this morning.  From the Phone here we can see shells bursting on Achi-Baba.  It is reported that 100000 Turkish reinforcements have arrived on the Peninsular, aeroplanes have been busy.
