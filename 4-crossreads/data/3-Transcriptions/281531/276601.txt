<p>10/8/18<br/>Framerville<br/>was also captured an 11 inch gun which with all its trucks caused much interest to the troops. There were 25 shells still left on the train and a French artillery officer came up &amp; arranged to fire off all these at the Boche. A number of German staff officers were captured at Framerville but the Corps. Commander got away. The village is one of the ordinary type &amp; not much damaged. Just at the entrance to the village there was a German lying on his back dead and covered with flies. He was wearing the ribbon of the Iron Cross but a search of his clothes did not reveal anything worth taking. In the first houses we entered in the village we struck plenty of equipment and German clothing lying around the house, artillery wagons and other gear</p>
