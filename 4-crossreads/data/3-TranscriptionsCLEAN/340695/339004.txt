Asked Madame there if she had a bed for the night & luckily for us she had. 3-9-17 Moved from Caestre to Erny St Julien, a glorious trip through beautiful country. Had one mishap near Mametz the steering gear went crook. During the halt we dined by the wayside on the edge of a wheatfield. Arrived safely about 1 p.m. but all hands are very disappointed with the village it is such a quiet place. We are back for a rest but for how long we do not know. We are miles from anywhere but prettily situated the country looks beautiful.
