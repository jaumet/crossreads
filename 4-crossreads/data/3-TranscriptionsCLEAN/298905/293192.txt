  
 all the noted men of England have been buried, all are buried with the exception of two beneath the stones of the crypt the two exceptions as you might guess are Nelson & Wellington, they have also got the immense carriage which Wellingtons body was carried through the streets of London, & on it are the weapons they fought with in those days a most interesting collection, in here we fell in with two ladies who volunteered to show us St Bartholmew's Church the oldest in London dating back from 1131 it is carefully guarded as it is a precious possession. In this old church you will find plenty of old oaken tablets with the old fashioned English way
