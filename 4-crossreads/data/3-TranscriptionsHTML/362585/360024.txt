<p>pleasure at seeing us.</p>
<p>As money was no object to us, we procured a taxi &amp; told the drive to go where he liked provided he could show us something worth seeing.  First we went through the city itself, &amp; then out onto a beautiful new concrete road that wound round the side of a mountain overlooking the town.  It was a beautiful drive, &amp; every now &amp; then we would run into an avenue of firs so thickly planted as to be like a forest one either side of the road.  The trees are no more than five or six feet apart anywhere, &amp; instead of there <strike>being</strike> merely being a single row like in our avenues at home, they stretch back for about a hundred yards.  We returned to the transport in time for dinner &amp; the whole afternoon only cost us five &amp; sixpence each.</p>
<p>I am enclosing some leaves which I believe are very pretty if you keep them long enough.</p>
<p>Remember me to everyone &amp; to uncle &amp; auntie &amp; Ethel if she is still in Sydney.</p>
