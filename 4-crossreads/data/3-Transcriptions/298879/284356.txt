<p>April 1915<br/>Tuesday 6<br/>Muster parade in full marching order. Raining. Bread issued. Baked on board. Quite a luxury now.  Sea very rough. Chick Hughes Charlie Reilly, &amp; another chap &amp; myself made a bivouac on boat deck to sleep on. It was guard &amp; slept so well that we nearly missed breakfast next morning. Ship only travelled 104 miles today.</p>
<p>Wednesday 7<br/>Land in sight on both sides of the ship. Very strong cold wind blowing. The land we see is believed to be the Aegaen Archipeligo. Travelling very slowly still. Full marching order twice today &amp; were issued with 200 rounds of ammunition per man as they expect that our landing will be opposed. Bought a good pair of boots from Cpl. Bramhall for 20 piasters (4/- English)<br/>Am experiencing difficulty in changing Egyptian money. I should have changed at Alexandria</p>
