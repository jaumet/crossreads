<p>Our guns worrying Fritz. They give him absolutely no peace. The weather is rotten to say the least of it. Nothing but mud everywhere. Many men are going to hospital with trench feet.<br/>Our section had some narrow escapes from Fritz's high explosive shells. We get a gleam of sunshine now and again down here on the Somme.</p>

<p>We left the trenches again last night. The 2nd Div. relieved us. Our aeroplanes were extremely active yesterday. We watched some wonderful manoeuvring in the air also a couple of air duels! Our aeroplanes do not seem to be able to catch Fritz as far as speed is concerned.</p>
