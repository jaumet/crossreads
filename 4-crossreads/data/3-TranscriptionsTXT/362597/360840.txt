Just as sports finished a bit of a storm blew up & we have some nice big rollers about us.
Tuesday 28.12.15 (6)Have been suffering all day from the effects of the blow. Had no breakfast or dinner but made up for it at tea. Have some medicine in my pocket but carry it as a mascot. The cure is worse than the disease.
Several whales seen to-day but I missed them. Am going to write home tonight.
Wednesday 29.12.15 (7)Sea much calmer & land sighted after 3 days. Passed Albany heads at 2 pm
