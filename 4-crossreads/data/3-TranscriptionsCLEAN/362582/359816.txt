not feeling it so much as last year, have more comforts here. Have gone in for bathing & am getting on famously with my swimming. Our medical officers are all very good to us - they swim over to our part & take us out. Some of them are very strong swimmers. I'm well cared for, our O.C. always takes me out & I do a little more each time. Shall try & send you a snap-shot of us, one of the Sisters photographed us. I've got a new bathing-suit & cap. Came from Port Said & it looks just the thing. We bath in the lake. Last Friday Sister Bell & I had our last sail with Lieut. Wylde - it was a beautiful afternoon & we three agree so well, quite sad he had to go back to duty on Saturday-morn. We returned after 6.30 p.m. We two sisters just got back in time for dinner - then at 9 p.m. the N.C.O's & Orderlies gave a Concert & the Sisters
