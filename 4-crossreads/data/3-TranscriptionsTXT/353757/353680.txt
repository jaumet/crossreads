Dear Vol,
I received your letter and delayed replying on account of pressure of work, - nearly 2 a.m. every day &ndash; worse, - much worse than campaigning in the political arena.
I received printed matter and other particulars in ample time before the election, and same had my attention.  Coming back to camp late one night, I saw a man from the P.L.L. giving out "How to vote" slips, and immediately buttoned him.  He said they would not let him in, so I volunteered to distribute for him.  This I did, first writing on each &ndash; "If you live in Nepean, vote Molesworth".
I was extremely sorry to see that all the work of your supporters, and more on account of the immense amount of work you yourself put in, that it was of no avail;  you did well, however, and it is a cert for you next time.  I hope to be able to assist you.
Regarding any business you can fix up for some of my wives during my absence, I would say you should know that moderation in everything is one of my characteristics.  I have only one wife, and have asked her to communicate with you re Starr-Bowkett, Will, or Shares, should she be puzzled at any time.  If you could assist her at any time, your best friend would appreciate it.
Would like to see you or hear from you ere my departure, sort of "Look for last", feeling.
Remember me to your parents and sisters, and remember me your friend, -
A. Hine
