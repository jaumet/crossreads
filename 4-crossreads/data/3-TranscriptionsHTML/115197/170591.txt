<p>mail.&nbsp; Leave Waterloo 12.30 - after a pleasant journey and a change at Brochenhurst.&nbsp; I arrive at &quot;Mentone&quot; Milford-on-Sea at 3.30 a.m.&nbsp; Milford overlooks the Sea and in the hazy distance lies the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>A jolly walk along the cliffs with Mr Scales, Mrs Matthews, Honor and Joyce.&nbsp; Much talk and laughter.</p>
<p>A game of whist!</p>
