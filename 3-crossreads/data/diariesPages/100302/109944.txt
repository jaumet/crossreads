Dijon
27/3/16
We reached Dijon at 1700. It is a fine town built close under the hills which tower up behind. Some of the buildings have the 17th century appearance and are good in architecture. A Jardin Botanique is near the centre of the town. The railway yards are extensive and under guards, fatigues of soldiers were also at work, shifting material. What strikes one is the lot of water lying round either in ponds or brooks ? we should consider the place very damp. 
At the station crowds of men women wished us bon voyage and the girls got a lot of badges from the fellows ? they will have to pay for them afterwards. There is no doubt about it the French women are great 
beauties with delightful complexions charming vivacity.
The railway locomotives are good and wedge shaped on funnel, boiler cab to render less opposition to air. The roads are white and excellent, avenued with trees at present bare of leaves. We do not now expect to go through Paris but to make a detour round it.
The houses are high often 3 storied with attics and sloping roofs. Very big cuttings had to be made when this line was built. Our trip today has been a carnival of green lovely grass and shades. Every thing looks so trim and clean and the people match their surroundings. They certainly have a country that is worth dying for. 
About 3 miles from Dijon is a high peak upon the summit of which is a statue ? religious?
