<p>I am looking forward very much to the real break of spring, for I have never seen it in this hemisphere. In Australia it is a very passive change, made most noticeable by the sudden bloom of the Boronia &amp; Flannel Flowers,   &amp; the songs   &amp; mating of the birds: but here, I believe, a week may change a scene completely, from the bare trees to the beautiful green ones.<br/>In Australia of course, the trees are evergreen, and the grass is much greener in winter than any other time, as there is no snow except on the mountains, you see there will be a great difference.<br/>Well, I look forward to visiting you, perhaps not far from the present. I'm feeling very fit. Please give my kind regards to Ms Lidgett, &amp;  with many thanks again<br/>Yours very truly<br/>Dene B. Fry</p>
