 My cyclist orderly just returned from Herbertshohe states he heard some firing on his right while returning.  He was also informed that party had been sent by Beresford towards WT station to bring in a motor lorry & that  the party returned reporting that it had been fired upon   a messenger returning from this party reporting they had been fired on no other reason for troops being at Kabakaul
