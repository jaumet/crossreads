<p>&amp; general work &amp; getting a recquisition prepared. Most cases were trench foot with a few general sickness &amp; wounded. Great happenings in the line during the night. It appears that something in the nature of a general withdrawal of Fritz from his front line was made &amp; our Chaps have advanced a distance ranging from different reports from 600 yds to 10 miles. All we know for sure is that an advance has been made without opposition.
