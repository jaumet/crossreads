  
 Thursday 15th Since Monday things on this front were very quiet, the Weather being very bad, Raining & it being very misty which prevented Fritz from coming over for Observations, This Morning the Weather cleared & it was fine all day hardly a cloud could be seen Fritz was over Observing very early & after Dinner Fritz's big Guns started & he was sending high Explosives over all the Afternoon first one side of St Jean station Yard then the other, hitting several old deserted Dug Outs, one shell landed amongst a lot of Teuts sending them & kits up in the Air, the Men were all away on duty & nobody was hurt, one of his shells landed just in front of 4 9 Point 2. Guns close to Admiral Road about 200 yds from the Yard, the Guns had been fireing for a while & the shell soon stopped them, at 4 Pm. I was attatched to a Train containing a Working party, waiting for line clear when a Dud landed a few yards away, much to our relief also two Officers on board my Engine, the line was soon clear & off we went to Reigersberg
