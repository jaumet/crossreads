<p>[Contd. from page 152]<br/>But will not own up when we are asked<br/>"Who's life had we assisted?<br/>That it was but a common horse<br/>Who's leg rope had got twisted.</p>
<p>So now you know our history<br/>Of how we served the King<br/>And how we watered horses<br/>And made the brushed ring<br/>Now don't proclaim us heroes<br/>For we're bashful to the core<br/>And when the war is over<br/>We'll be Civvies ever more.</p>
