 sort of way each night would see us in a trench nearer nearer the enemi there was Switch Trench then rose [ ? ] trench then enter a long communic trench with chocol colour mud up over the knee , one had to go veri slow as we kept get bog the long rubber boot although they kept your feet dri use to caus the damp to come through , the heat of the leg I expect . When we final got into the front line of Trench we found out that owe to the flood natur of the Countri that the trench were not connect togeth the line had to be patrol from one Battalion to anoth everi so often , also that shell hole in the Front had to be held as a sort of outpost . I was out twice in three day each time for 24 hour , our ration were brought out to us in a sandbag by Patrol dure the dark hour of the night . We were four in number should have been six but we were short of men . All we could do was to watch one end of the hole as it lead along to where the Hun were , but as this trench was flood we could have easili heard anyon tri to make his way along to where we were which was suppos to be a secret post so we laid low kept our eye ear open although a good few shell came our way , I am glad to say none actual land where we were . It was bitter cold wet we were sat down with our leg in mud water the rain pour down make a nois as it hit our Tin hat , there we stay 24 hour was glad when the relief came we sneak back
