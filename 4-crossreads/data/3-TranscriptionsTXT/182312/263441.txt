 was in no way due to the War (Oh no!) but was caused through the 
 failure of the wheat crop in some out-of-the-way province in Canada! 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Waterloo and in fact at all the terminal stations, 
 hundreds of women collect and pelt flowers at the wounded as they are 
 carried into the waiting ambulances.&nbsp; That they cannot find some 
 more tangible way of helping the war along seems a pity as I feel 
 sure they only come out of idle curiosity, the same as would attract 
 them round a street accident. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last stage of my journey was by ambulance to Wandsworth 
 - No.3 General Hospital - a distance of about 7 miles out, where I 
 was to cease my wanderings for a while. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to mention that whilst at Southampton I picked 
 up a &quot;London Daily Chronicle&quot; of 1st. August which had this one and 
 only piece of cable news from Australia: 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;with tremendous whiskers and hair hanging down 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his back another &quot;wild white man&quot; has been 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; captured east of Lindenow (Victoria) where he 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had been a terror to the women and children of 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the neighbourhood&quot;. 
 and I make no comment on it, except that it looks very much like the 
 Sydney Bulletin&#39;s style.
