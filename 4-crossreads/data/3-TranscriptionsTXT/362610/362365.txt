 Monday 29 May 1916 A rather dull day. In the morning had to take a fatigue party out to the Bombing School to work on a set of practice trenches that are being prepared. Got in soon after 1 o'c. &amp; in the afternoon had to turn up for an inspection parade of the company. A good deal of firing at aircraft during the day. On a/c of having an early morning fatigue the next day had no night fatigue &amp; was glad to be able to turn in.
