<p>The concert opened with Noble (brother of cricketer M.A.) singing the Prologue from "Pagliacci".   The poor old bird retains technique but has quite lost his voice and is in blissful ignorance of the fact!  The unaccompanied "Prologue" under such circumstances may be imagined!    And Smithy the Curly-haired Dip almost got the bird with his plaintive "Mother Machree".   But a nigger turn by an American sailor was really good.</p>
<p>The audience felt a nerve quiver as what we thought was a mine bumped the hull heavily.</p>
<p>There was a tense 3 seconds waiting for the explosion;   but it was only a drifting ice-floe.</p>
<p>The crowd expects to go to the bottom;  if we are very lucky "Wolf" will race some patrol-boats into neutral waters and intern;  all wait quite calmly for either of these events to occur.</p>
<p>Nobody expects to reach Germany.</p>
