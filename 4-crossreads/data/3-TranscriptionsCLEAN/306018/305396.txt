  
 February 1917 the train & reached El Arish just before daybreak & unloaded the goods.  On inquiring I found the Regiment were at Mazar & wouldn't be coming on to El Arish for some days.  I left a guard on the stuff & came back to Mazar & was told to bring it back.  Whilst at El Arish a mine was washed up on shore.  A machine gun tried to explode it  but failed so a mountain gun was brought down & it fixed the mine up.  Went off with a great roar. 
 Two soldiers bathing got caught in the undertow & several attempts failed.  An Australian went in on his horse & got them out.  It was a good bit of work.  A Taube aeroplane came over but our guns gave it a warm time & it didn't drop any bombs.  The Egyptian Labour Corps are very frightened of the bombs & they run about like "lost sheep".  They get silly with terror.  A previous night air raid accounted for about 60 of them, mostly through their foolishness.  I saw 18 Turkish prisoners
