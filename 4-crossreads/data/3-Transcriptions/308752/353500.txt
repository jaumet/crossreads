<p>killed &amp; two wounded. At 8 o'clock we were relieved but unfortunately a stretcher case came along, &amp; as my squad was next for duty we were obliged to carry the case along to the next post. On arriving there we found that another man of the 8th had been seriously wounded, Joe Connell (you have his photo). A rush of cases were passing through his post so that meant to carry our patient to the next post. &amp; even here we had to continue on with our patient, so you can imagine what a long carry it was &amp; plenty of gifts from Fritz were dropping about also. On arriving at the Dressing Station we were all dismayed to know that Major Mackenzie &amp; Pte. Tydsley had been wounded &amp; that Joe Connell was dying. Joe was an old cobber of mine, we were in the same tent together at Queens Park,  it made me feel a little queer for a while. The bearers made their way to those famous dugouts which I have mentioned so often,  here we will stop till the morrow &amp; then "home sweet home again".   We would have all liked to have cleared out today but our luck was out. About 1 o'clock, I had a lift in a lorry to a fair sized town,  here I obtained a shave, haircut, shampoo &amp; a hot bath, so you can guess how I felt &ndash; a new man. After enjoying a glorious meal &ndash; fried steak, eggs &amp; green peas I returned to the dungeon (a really good name for our diggings)    In the morning another sad event occurred,  a few of our bearers went for a bath situated about &frac34; of a mile from our quarters,  an unlucky shell landed there,  Frank Moore was killed, Ptes Roberts &amp; Pither were wounded. The latter have joined the Unit,  fortunately they were only slightly wounded.  Oh, if we had only returned to our Unit yesterday this would not have happened. At 1 o'clock the glorious news came through that the lorries were at hand to take the men back to the Unit so it did not take us long to clear out. Arrived back home again at 2 o'clock just in time for Joe's funeral. I received a great surprise on being told that I had been awarded the Military Medal, my name was included in a list of 13,  I am indeed very lucky. Whatever I was recommended for is more than I can say. The following are the Military Medal awards &ndash; Sgt. Matheson, L.Corpl. McCallum, L Cpl. Berry, L.Cpl. Hunt, L.Cpl. Powell, Ptes. Miller, Ridgway, Wiggins, Hippesley, Watts, Calf, Atherton &amp; myself.  Why I was awarded, is more than I can say.</p>
