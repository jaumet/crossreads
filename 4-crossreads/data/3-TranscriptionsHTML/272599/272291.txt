<p>1917  Monday 22  Jan.</p>
<p>Work as usual.  The 14th F. A. is taking over today &amp; our unit moves bag &amp; baggage to Albert en route to where (?) The frost still holds mud &amp; water in an iron grip, a few weeks ago since a thaw. <br/>We do not leave till morning. Crowd of us go to Merricourt to Vaudeville Show. Barney with the Tommy guard. Find a queue &frac14; mile long waiting to get into show. Drift down to the entrance &amp; after manoeuvering slip in &amp; get fair seat. Huge building seating nearly 2,000, such a crush &amp; hundreds unable to get in. Wouldn't Fritz have got a haul <strike>till</strike> if he dropped a few bombs. Show good &amp; poor. Fine 13th Batt. Band though. 'Twas good to hear dinkum music again. Quips &amp; unvarnished compliments.</p>
