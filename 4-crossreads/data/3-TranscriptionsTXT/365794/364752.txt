 Friday 14 December 1917 Another &frac12; day and very enjoyable too.  Went Mouski with S. Leed, bought brass bowl 7/-, 2 runners at 3/6 each, busy scenes and oh such a medly of human beings &amp; donkey carts &amp; vehicles of all descriptions through narrow streets &amp; doubtful looking quarters. Paid Pt. 4 for garry to Liptons, had 4 p.m. tea then &ndash; alone &ndash; went shopping, etc., back 6.50 p.m. &amp; no convoy duty!! This has been neglected lately but one day is so like another that one never knows how they slip by. Another anniversary of Kath's leaving us has come &amp; gone &ndash; 15 years ago - &amp; yet it hurts as much as ever only, thank God! one does not think of it so much or so often as in bygone days.
