<p>Thursday 13 March 1919<br/>Rain all the afternoon but was very nice in the morning. Went to Mountivilliers for a stroll. Did quite a lot of renovating in the hut. Played basketball at the gym. Gee I'm soft. Very. Had a talk with [indecipherable], Gray, Laggugreen &amp; Freckleton. They are all down waiting to go home.</p>
<p>Friday 14 March 1919<br/>On boat picquet today. Left here at 3 pm &amp; got back at 8 pm. No trouble at all. Saw some of the old [indecipherable] off. Very cold tonight.</p>
