<p>3.  It was on March 21st.  that Leo left from Alexandria &amp; the 22nd., the next day that Rid sailed from the same port; they just missed one another by a day, though may possibly meet in the "Somewhere" to which they have gone.<br/>When I last wrote to you I think it was the evening of Tuesday 21st.  and I had just had a wire from Rid telling of their leaving for Alex. late that night, but I did not know whether it would be possible to get there in time to see him next day or not.  I got up early next morning &amp; was ready to catch the 7.30 a.m train to Alex. if a wire came, but one came about 9 o'clock &amp; I caught the 9.30 from here.  Leo's letter I received just as I was leaving &amp; I posted it on to you from Alexandria though was doubtful whether the Censor would pass it through.  He did not know any more than anyone else where they were going but took for granted the general rumour of France, specially as he said that they had had gas helmets issued to them  That, with the dates of leaving Serapeum &amp; Alex. was the gist of the note, if you have not received it in the original.<br/>Rid could not get any more leave than on to the wharf &amp; we had from 1.30 to 3.30 there.  If I were a soldier here I would say that I am just about "fed up" of these partings, and I wonder if you would understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were indeed grateful to have the opportunity of a farewell at all, but aren't they wretched heart-breaking squashing affairs.  I believe I behaved quietly enough when I had to come away but my inside was like a rebellious mad screaming child.  A brilliant sort of soldier's wife &amp; sister n'est pas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never mind the war's soon going to be over now &amp; we are all coming home like a lot of rowdy spoiled children, you see!</p>
