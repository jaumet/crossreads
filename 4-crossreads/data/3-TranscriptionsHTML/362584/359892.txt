<p>Dear Mrs Ferguson</p>
<p>I was awfully pleased to receive you letter. Thanks very much for writing to me. It is a long time since my last letter to you but we have been changing about so that there has been little spare time for writing more than home letters. In spite of being shifted temporary from the 20th I have managed to see a good deal of Arthur. You will have heard that he has at last got his company. These things usually come right in the end. He is of course doing very well. In the matter of health I have never seen him looking better. He is filling out &amp; shows no trace of ever having been sick. As a matter of fact we are all splendid advertisements for Anzac, Arnotts living pictures as it were. We have never been far from the 20th in Mudros,</p>
