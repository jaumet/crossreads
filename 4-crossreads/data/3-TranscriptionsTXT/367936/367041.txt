Sunday 17 September 1916Left Bir-el-abd at midnight and rode till about 10 a.m. across miles of white dry salt lakes.  Very hot in middle of day and horses would not stand still for us to sit in their shade on account of sand flies.  Heard some shooting but were only reserves.  Left about 3 p.m. & rode back to Bir-el-abd arriving about 10 p.m.  In charge of new officer Mr. Guthrie.
Monday 18 September 1916Riding all day back to Romani.  Most of horses pretty knocked up, men jolly tired too.
