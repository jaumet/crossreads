<p>This morning we were all out map reading &amp; sketching &amp; again in the afternoon, this class of work is very interesting. I hear tonight that the Yank's &amp; Australians had a big fight in London, &amp; the girls chucked in their lot with our fellows, from what I can gather the Yanks were chucking off at the English girls, &amp; they appealed to the Australians, who by the way would want very little persuasion from what I have seen of them, I can just imagine our chaps dodging up the street just spoiling for a fight, it would be fair into their hands, as the crews of the "Tennessee" at Alexandria remember well, the riot ended up in a victory for our chaps, after a great struggle</p>
