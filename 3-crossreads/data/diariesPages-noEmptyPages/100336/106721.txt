The following day during the afternoon we were sent for. We were conducted into the Commandant's Office. He and Captain Clifford were together. Captain Clifford pleaded for us saying if we remained there we would surely die. He said he would stand bail for us telling the Commandant that we would not go away again. The Commandant blamed me for being the originator of the scheme and said he would have me sent away into the interior as soon as a party was leaving. Then Captain Clifford took us with him to the hospital where we had a good bath and change of clothing and after that a good meal, Many a time since I have thanked him for that act of kindness, probably he was the means of saving our lives. I remained at the hospital for about 3 days. Then I had a bad attack of Malaria but it did not last long. The following day I was sent for and despatched to Afin-Kara-hissar with a few wounded and sick who had come through from the Palastine front. I have previously given a description of Afion under the new Commandant.
