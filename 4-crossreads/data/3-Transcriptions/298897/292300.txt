<p>Saturday 24th June1916<br/>Orderly sergeant for the day this being my first experience of this job.  Held the usual parades &amp; in addition had a boat alarm at 4.15 P.M. the men al being below at tea.  The siren blew two blasts at which signal the men appeared as if by magic, moving to their proper stations with commendable quickness &amp; quietness.  The crew were included, firemen &amp; all having to take up their positions.  After inspection we were dismissed to carry on with the day, about 10 being in sight at one time, a war boat nearly always being included.  Tis' comforting to see a T.B.D. appear, have a look at us &amp; off again  Weather calm &amp; warm.</p>
<p>Sunday 25th June<br/>Very misty &amp; foggy the foghorn going occasionally with earsplitting blasts.  Church parade during the morning conducted by General Clayton but very poorly, half the crowd not being able to hear.  Wrote a few letters in the afternoon ready to post on landing.  Passed south of Malta about midday the other ships going right into harbour.  One ship which had been with us right through</p>
