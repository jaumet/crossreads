 JANUARY 1917 
 21 SUNDAY 
 Fine & cold. Our section was 
 on duty & we took ammunition 
 up to the gun pits in the 
 evening. They have great 
 positions for the guns. Ours 
 is under a house in one 
 of the streets of Armentieres. 
 The whole place up there 
 is knocked about a lot 
 & nearly all the civilians have 
 left it. Our fellows roam 
 round the houses & get 
 anything they want to 
 make themselves comfortable. 
 We had our first casualty 
 today - Bob Fowler got one 
 in the knee. Got a big 
 mail in the evening
