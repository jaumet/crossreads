<p>Aug 1917<br/>(Boxing today)<br/>morning. At midday she started fireing &amp; manuvering fired about 17 shots at what most of us took to be a target. Some are convinced it was a Submarine. In fact the yarns go so far as saying 2 were sunk &amp; at night one or two men I know moved there hammocks nearer the steps to be able to get out quickley. I have a good position so can afford to laugh</p>
<p>Thursday  16th<br/>For the last 24 hours it has been a bit rough. The first time we have had a ripple since leaving Capetown</p>
<p>Friday 17th<br/>The Convoy has done quite a lot of manovering today</p>
