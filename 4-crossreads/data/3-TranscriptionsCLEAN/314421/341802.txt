 A cold miserable day, especially in the afternoon. 
 Several enemy observation planes were over today. The archie kept up a hot fire, & several of their duds fell near the stables. I heard that a piece of shrapnel fell through a hut and killed a soldier in another Division. 
 I saw Mr Hunter today. He used to be Transport officer. He has been in England since June & only returned yesterday.
