 Such is like , in a war Hospit . On Thursday Sunday visitor come round some of them are veri nice , other I fanci mere curious ? One ladi came in Soon after we arriv , she was in hope that she would be abl to find some of the Old 17th from Gallipoli , her son was report wound , kill and miss . I heard her tell one of the men near , and heard her say : That a Mr Price had written to her from Sydney tell her that inquiri had been made at Head Qs but that no definit news could be obtain . You bet when I heard the name mention I immedi thought that it must be Mrs. Horton but when she came and ask me if I was one of the 17th I knew that I was mistaken . Her son was out in Aus . and enlist . I fanci they are fair well off . one of her son come in sometim to bring a coupl of us book etc . I had a letter from Mr. Horton a few day ago ask me to go down and stay with them when I am fit to leav the Hospit instead of go to a convalesc camp . I hope I can manag it I also met a youngster belong to the B.E.F. Salvag Dept . in Albert , he gave me his home address and said that His Parent would be veri glad to receiv me at ani time . Some of these peopl will do anyth at all that lie in their power to help and give a wound soldier a good time . I guess a great mani of our moni men could come here and leav quit a lot , but I will not start on Comparison On the 23rd at 7 a.m. we walk across from our trench to Pozier , our compani should have gone in allmost unscath , but no we did as we were told and found ourselv under our own gun , for awhil they kept us think . I can tell you , if anyon had offer to bet me a tenner against my Pocket knife , that we would see daylight on Sunday I would not have accept for fear that I might lose the knife . it was hot , one Shell burst somewher
