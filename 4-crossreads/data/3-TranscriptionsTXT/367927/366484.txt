 [Previous pages not transcribed] 1 ST LIGHT HORSE REGIMENT. A.I.F. 
 Mr R.T. Jones of Linfield has given me the following information: 
 War was declared on August 4, 1914. The following men enlisted at YASS on August 6 &ndash; R. Davis, P. Shaw, H. Puckett and myself, R.T. Jones. We arrived in Sydney with our own horses on August 7 and stabled our horses for the next three or four days at the stables of Colonel J.W. Arnott at Pyrmont. Then Rosebery Racecourse was opened as a camp; we rode over there and were the first personnel to arrive for what was to be the 1 st Light Horse Regiment, A.I.F. 
 (Mr Jones' Regimental Number was 52).
