Aug 31.  Picquet changed at 10 A.M. & I had the rest of the day to myself, and woke writing in the morning & walking to St. Omer in the afternoon.
We had a bright & merry evening in the billet during the evening hours.
September 1.    Another day in the wood.   We had quite a picnic there, very little drill and plenty of blackberries.
Fellowship meeting in evening.
Sept.  2.   Church Parade in morning.
After lunch I walked through Renescure (5 K.) to Ebblinghem (3K.) and thence to Blaringhem (5.2K.)   At the latter town I had tea of four fried eggs & coffee.   During the trip I visited two churches and found the pictures especially, rather interesting.   The various interpretations of the "Stations of the Cross" by different artists are rather quaint (to the non-conformist mind, at any rate.).
I called to see Jack Rew at Ebblinghem on
