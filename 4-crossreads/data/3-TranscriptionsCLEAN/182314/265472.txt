Dear [Slane?]
Before sending the enclosed letter to the General I would like to know if you concur, with reference to the statement that "you are desirous of forming a Battalion band."
I should also like to make certain of the statement that some of your men were returned- Chalmers told me this when you were at Senlis.
Yrs
J. Travers.
 
Dear Travers,
Yes., 3 or 4 men were returned to us & I think the chief reason was that their particular instruments were becoming too numerous & thus upsetting the "balance". I think some men were imported by transfer from another brigade. I am forming a drum and fife band, the instruments are now on their way from England  Yr Slane
