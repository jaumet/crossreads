[21st Aug. contd]a spell - somewhere the other side of St Omer)  At night Fritz again made himself known but did no damage near us.
Wednesday 22ndUp at 6 am breakfast early and by 9 am we were on the road to Steenwerck Station where we arrived about 11 am.  Then we participated in something we hadn't done for 9 months,  Rode in a train (dink carriages)  Thro Bailleul we passed Strazele & Borre to Arques where lo & behold we saw some English Khaki girls and they looked - well like jewels after so many months of French faces.  Arques looked an excellent little town - the river, the hospital, barges etc. - quite English like.
Here we branched off the main line (this junction being not far from St Omer) & numerous quarries were seen along the route probably chalk pits.  In time we arrived at Wizernes where we detrained in fairly warm sunshine with strong wind.  Then the march began.  I was detailed with others to assist in wheeling the wheeled stretchers.  Soon after starting we struck a steep hill & it took the wind out of our sails.  However on arrival at top we were allowed to dump our packs
