9th December 1916 Reveille 5 o'clock. Left camp with staff at 7 for the range. 7th 8th Brigades shot from two positions. Shooting splendid. Day was rather good but cold. After we march past after shooting was over the General spoke to our officers. He spoke well of our Brigade as a whole and remarked it was the best performance he has had in Salisbury for a long time. All our shooting stunts turned out well I think. Got back to camp at 2 o'clock and was very disappointed to find that my weekend leave was cut out. Anyhow I did stables and at night went to the Pictures.
10th December 1916 Early morning stables. Harness cleaning midday horses stables again. This not our Sunday rest idea. I don't think in part of the day. Wrote a letter to Millie, Beattie Katherine.
