<p>there was a serious struggle going on in which our people were shoulder deep.   The officer did not go to the General, but wrote back to the effect that he had noted my paragraphs.   Right oh.   He will not trouble further, but he will execute my orders with despatch, should he not do so I have means where by to make him lose a night or two from sleep.   I hate loafers in all the departments of life whether in the army or out of it   Many a time in my speeches in the Legislative Council have it stated that there was necessity for a bill such as the registration bill, or rather act which is now in force in England, where by every one will be placed in the class of work or trade, which he claims to be able to perform, this that he may be compelled to undertake for the good of all that wherein he is competent.  My object, when speaking was to have every man enrolled that he might have a government charter which would give him the right to labour in the land free from the domination of any unauthorised body in the country, who took unto themselves legislative powers without the voters having the chance to controll.  My friends of the Trades Hall were deadly opposed to the idea because it would rob them at one stroke of all their powers.   It has had to be done now as a matter of self defence for the nation against the slack and the loafer, and it will continue to be the law of the land long after the war has sunk into oblivion.   The public and the individual must be protected against unauthorised associations, because they do but pray upon the weak, in the guise that they are acting for the good of the lowly and humble.   Associations have their spheres of usefulness, but they must not go beyond it, because they at once become tyranous to those who are not strong enough to protect themselves.</p>

<p>My Kitty dear:   The first date on your letter is:  "West Maitland. 2nd June 1914".   Many thanks for writing to me when you were on your holiday to Maitland.   It indicates that midst changed scenes you had thoughts for the Old Man. [A line of Xs and Os.] It was horrid to be with the No. 1 A.G.H. crowd.  I fully appreciate the change.   Please thank Dearrie very much for sending to me the copies of the Catholic Press, two reached me by the mail that carried your letter, and the one from Buddie.</p>
<p>I must write to Mrs Silk thanking her for being good to you.  I hope that the Nips will ask Mrs Reynolds to come to Sydney for a few weeks.</p>
<p>You are right about the war my dear, it is not improving much from our point of view.   One train load of wounded arrived from Ale</p>
