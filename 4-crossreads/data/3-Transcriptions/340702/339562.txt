<p>for a little while we thought that it was gas. For the rest of the night one of our party kept us awake by rushing out every time he heard a plane &amp; detailing its progress. Fritz also shelled Allonville all night, driving the 4th Brigade 13th Batt. out, it is said that one big Shell caused 200 Casualties in Killed &amp; Wounded.</p>
<p>6.6.18   Leave started again two days ago. Fritz bombed us again last night. Letters to Dave &amp; Smethurst yesterday. A cheeky Fritz plane sailed over us today. Our fellows brought him down less than an hour later they "Circussed" him (surrounded him). Then Napoo Fritz. We have the best of it in the air. Hope he don't come tonight. I'm right in the middle of it &amp; have to stay till midnight</p>
<p>9.6.18   Received letter from Rudrun yesterday. He was booked for Aussie and lost his chance absolutely through his own fault. R.E.P.B. men are being returned to the line (damn shame)</p>
<p>10.6.18 Bluey came a lovely Gutser today. When the villagers left before the advance of the Germans they left a lot of clothing behind, the result was that a number of Anzacs appeared clad in glad rags. Top hats, Frock coats etc. Well Bluey has been wearing a sac suit for some time &amp; today an M.P. gathered him in and  put him in the clink. It took all the Sergt Major could do to get him out. The charge is still hanging over him. The M.P. told him that he could be shot on two charges namely Looting &ndash; and discarding his uniform. Letters G to M. Card to Ciss.</p>
<p>13.6.18  I suppose it is hardly necessary</p>
