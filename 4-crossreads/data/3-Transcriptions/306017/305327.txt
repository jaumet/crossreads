<p>April 1916<br/>manage to get back to camp shortly after dark</p>
<p>On Tuesday 4th April we left Serapeum at noon.  The Brigade marched to Moaska that afternoon &amp; camped there the night.  The next day they marched the rest of the distance across the desert arriving at Salhia about 2 pm Wednesday.  I was with the baggage party &amp; we came on by passenger train to Zag-a-Zig where we stayed the night.  We had leave to go up to the town &amp; got a decent feed.  Arrived a Salhia before 9 next morning passing through beautiful irrigation country.  The niggers are terrible thieves there &amp; even shot at an officer of the guards when interfered with.  Salhia is a good site for a large camp &amp; the whole mounted division consisting of 16 Regiments Australian &amp; NZlrs will be here within a few days  We soon got settled down.  There are mess-sheds canteens &amp; shops &amp; a good water supply.  Our Brigade were the first</p>
