Saturday 28 July 1917.
Feeling crook this morning. Reveille 4 a.m. Breakfast 6 a.m. Baggage guard on wagon & left at 7.30 a.m. to Moascar Station. The rest of C.B.F.A. came along later. Entrained at 10.20 a.m. Arrived at Cairo and disentrained at 1/4 to 2 p.m.
Baggage guard again out to Main Abbassia Camp. Nigger driver tried to take me down. Feeling all all out to it. 
All the way along tlhe railway line the fields are highly cultivated & as the result beautiful crops are on the land. Saw guns used by Napoleon and in the distance saw Pyramids.
2 of the boys L.H.F.A. who left a week or so ago have come to grief - 1 killed & 1 wounded so we hear.
