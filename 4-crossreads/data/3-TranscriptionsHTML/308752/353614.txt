<p>Willie Paul called in to see me, and you can bet that we had a good old yarn, as it was over three years since I saw him last. We were camped within fifty yards of each other for over a week &amp; neither of us knew it. Nothing startling to report in regards our stay here, a little drill was done in the mornings, &amp; the rest of the days we had to ourselves. I spent the time away by writing out the account of my Blighty Trip &amp; attending a few Educational Classes.</p>
<p>Sunday 22nd September 1918.<br/>Memorial Service held in honour of L/Cpl Powell, L/Cpl. Hills, Charlie Whittaker &amp; Jim Eldridge, by Corporal Cosier. It was indeed a most impressive Service, one that I shall never forget. I have never seen men break down as they did this night.</p>
<p>Monday 23 September 1918 &ndash; Friday the 26th September.<br/>Brigade Sports held today at Le Mesnil, as usual the 8th Field Ambulance was well represented, &amp; we won a number of events. The famous 8th Brigade Band, which was on board the "Beltana" was in attendance &amp; rendered excellent music. Came across Shenning &amp; MacKenzie from Neutral Bay,  they were both well. In evening I went to the Coo-ees Pierrot Show, which was very good. Wild rumours afloat that very shortly we would be going into the Line again, &amp; have a go at the Hindenburg Line, &amp; then out we would go for our long promised rest.</p>
