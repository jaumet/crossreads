Cole started off with Austin but could'nt get off the ground, - hit a mound of earth, ran over a little hillock, &amp; crashed! They were'nt hurt but the machine was, - up the poleski. Well they beat the Bedouins off took what they could from their machines &amp; made for our lines. That was in the morning about 7.30 or 8am. They reached our Light-Horse outposts late in the afternoon after having walked about 17 miles through enemy country. We made certain they would be prisoners. 
 Well about &frac12; hour after the first trouble with Brown, - The other 5 of us were making for home you'll remember &ndash; my engine coughed once or twice, &amp; then gave out. I had run dry of petrol (still in enemy country) We were about 6,oooft up, so I vol-planed down &amp; looked around for a suitable landing ground where the other machines could land too. I signalled to the others that I was to have a forced landing (with a smoke bomb signal)
