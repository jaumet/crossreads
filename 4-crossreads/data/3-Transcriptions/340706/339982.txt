<p>28<br/>big day &amp; am sleepy so go along to Hotel St Jean &amp; find a big room with two double beds &amp; turn in.</p>
<p>6 January 1919<br/>Train has left as 6-20 this morning &amp; as I arrive at 8 am I do not catch it. There is some trouble with the ticket &amp; it costs me 12 fr. to go as far as Tille for I will not pay fare right through. As Antwerp is near a trip fills in the morning but there is nothing to say about it except that it is a big commercial city intersected by canals &amp; block with punts &amp; shipping.</p>
<p>On return visit museum of old arms &amp; cannons at Port de Hal one of the old gates of the ancient city of Bruxelles. From here you catch a blue tram to the field of (V) Waterloo which does not repay the time (1 hr) spent in reaching it. The pc gives all that is to be seen.</p>
<p>On return I take tram to Grimberghen as far as the other side of the city as Tervueren is on south? passing on the way the Royal Park with a grand tower monument &amp; old time plain looking building once a palace, then past Japanese Tower erected as a monument &amp; also a chinese palace.</p>
<p>Returning to city I must look around for dinner &amp; find a friend in need who takes me to several places &amp; finally I dine very well in a little restaurant</p>
