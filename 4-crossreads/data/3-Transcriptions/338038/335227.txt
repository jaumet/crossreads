<p>Well Pater we are getting a little bit into shape now with these new commands. I have an excellent lot of fellows in my Battery. One of my Sergeants being Tommy Clark who used to live on the River. Altogether, I find the responsibility of Captain is not weighing me down so far.</p>
<p>We have had several Light Horse Officers drafted into the Artillery lately as recruit Officers, among which are Colonel Vernon &amp; Ted Hordern (who used to ride past on that brown horse occasionally)</p>
<p>You will notice by the heading that we have moved from our last address at Tel-el-Kebir. We are now at Serapeum, right</p>
