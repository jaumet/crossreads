onto the promenade which is known as the Hoe. The Hoe looks is on to the top of a hillside and looks out to sea, across the harbour and breakwater, right out to Eddystone Lighthouse. 
The lawns around the Hoe are in magnificent condition, like green velvet; it is a glorious spot. The chief attraction on the Hoe is the fine bronze statue to Sir Francis Drake. Here lies the identical green on which Drake played his famous game of bowls when the Spanish Armada hove in sight. Close by is the famous recreated Smeaton Tower. The original second lighthouse which erected on the Eddystone rock. 
Great crowds gather on the green and promenade during the afternoon,
