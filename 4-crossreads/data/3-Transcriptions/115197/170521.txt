<p>Quarters.&nbsp; A quaint church and its simplicity of style and architecture.&nbsp; We take a Camp Bay Car from the City in response to an invitation of yesterday and are shortly in the home of Mr Higgo - an old Cape Town resident.&nbsp; This part of the District is called the Kloof which is the Boer or Dutch equivalent of our word &quot;Cleft&quot;.</p>
<p>It is actually the dip or valley which was between Table Mountain</p>
