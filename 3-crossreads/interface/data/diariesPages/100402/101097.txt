Monday 1 July
Another glorious day and fairly quiet, except for local shelling. An anti aircraft, German, did hit our house doing no damage. The Boshe forestalled our chaps in working on the ?plane in no man's land, getting up to it taking portable parts away.
Tuesday 2 July
One case last night. Machine gun fire along our track is sometimes severe. Heavy shelling on our left this morning. Glorious day to-day. Living very well indeed.
