I am writing tonight in a nice comfortable room belonging to the French people where we are billeted, there is a nice fire going in the room & we have chairs lamps & a table & everything is nice & cosy   outside it is cold & the hail is falling thick & heavy, & both combined makes one think of the poor devils in the trenches & also of our fair  far away homes, where at this present time the sun is shining   it is now about 8 oclock in the evening here & as there is nearly 10 hours difference in the time I guess the sun is shining alright, thats what we miss I think as much as anything the nice warm sun, we very seldom see it now & when we do it is very pale & sickly looking & not the slightest sign of heat in it
