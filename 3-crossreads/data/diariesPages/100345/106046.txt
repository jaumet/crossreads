When the boys come home
We are proud of our boys, our brave boys
who for their country are fighting
Not for the sake of conquest or gain
but for the wrongs that needed righting
For the sake of the lands that lie ruined 
For the sake of the homeless sad
For the sake of the loved ones in homeland
They have given up all they had 
We think of them there in the trenches
In the cold the mud the rain
With the fiery shells bursting round them
While they fight with might main
But what keeps our brave boys so steadfast
with courage that never gives way?
The Lord stands beside them to help them
and he is their strength their stay
But where did they learn of this Saviour
save from the lips of their mother
or from some comrade who loved him
who spoke of Him one to another
But some had forgotten this Saviour
Till danger, death alarm
(when the comrade fell dead beside him)
made them fly to his sheltering arm
But what about you in the Homeland
Is this Saviour precious to you
Do you pray him to keep these dear lads
 commit them to him anew.
are you keeping your promises to them
are you helping with all your might
To comfort cheer help them
who have bravely gone to the fight
When this terrible war is ended
 the boys ? the brave boys ? come home
come back to loved ones - mother
ah! what will they find when they come
a world where all is against them
a struggle for life to begin
or their loved ones dear mother 
awaiting to welcome them in.
