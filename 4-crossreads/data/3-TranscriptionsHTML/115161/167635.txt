<p>steps until we finally arrive at the sugar refinery where our cookers still remain.&nbsp; Here is a banquet indeed, hot tea and stew.&nbsp; Our cook &quot;Tom&quot; always studied our welfare.&nbsp; We could always depend on &quot;Tom&quot; and his mates having something hot on our return.</p>
<p>After partaking of our meal, we simply lie down where we are, in the open, wet through, mud from head to foot, and dead tired, we sleep a well-earned sleep.</p>
<p>The following morning after breakfast we turn to and endeavour to relieve ourselves of some of the mud, then a general clean-up of our rifles and equipment.&nbsp; We think (poor fools) that in a day or so the sun may shine and dry our clothes a bit.</p>
