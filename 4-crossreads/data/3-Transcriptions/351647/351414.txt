<p>our crowd.</p>
<p>I wonder how you are of course we haven't had a mail for 5 or 6 weeks &amp; everybody is going stark staring mad over it.</p>
<p>I sent you a scarf, hope you don't mind, I rather liked the colour, it may go with one of your frocks.</p>
<p>I saw a great thing in Maid of the Mountains, a dress of dull gold tissue &amp; lined with either old rose (or deep salmon, I couldn't quite make out which) but watching it was like listening to delicious music or drinking nice champagne on a hot day.</p>
<p>I must flee really.  I hope things are good.  I'll write again quite soon.</p>
<p>Neil Brown (Fanny Louisa's nephew) is here &amp; doesn't he love her.</p>
<p>Pleasant domestic picture, 6 men in various stages of undress grouped round a fire &amp; various <strike>fires</strike> lights round them.  And what are these men doing?  Only chatting.</p>
<p>After that, good night.  Love to Graham, the Boss &amp; Mac, also Mrs. Ellis.</p>
<p>Yours<br/>Wilkie</p>
