<p>Went over &amp; saw Len last night he tells me he is going to France at the end of the month.<br/>This morning I got a letter from Horsferry Rd. advising me that they had received my medal &amp; that it would be presented to me at the earliest opportunity at a parade in England, I was beginning to wonder what had become of it, for I had heard nothing more since February when it came out in Battn. Orders &amp; was read out on parade at Meteren.<br/>From what I can gather, I believe the 1st. Division has been badly cut up in the last advance round Libons.<br/>23rd.  Very cloudy &amp; it looks a lot like rain this morning quite a change to the hot weather of the last week or two &amp; I am not sorry for the change</p>
