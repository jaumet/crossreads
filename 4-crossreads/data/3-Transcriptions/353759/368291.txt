<p>3.<br/>Brother Cole was very funny one day on the Braemar Castle: he'd been "Gawd stoning me" with Sedj. when somehow or other he started off to an audience on the infinite superiority of the discipline in the English Army. (Cole's been in several Armies  so he's the "Man who Knows") also on the various venereal diseases. &ndash; a S.A. parade that morning was the explanation of the last subject &ndash; always a strong one with us. Coli told several yarns all more or less possible but improbable, when he got onto the subject of smartness in carrying out of orders and especially the inteligence of horses and animals with regard to Military commands. From thence he got onto India and the elephant.<br/>"Why, brother," he said " do you know that in India when the Elephants hear the bugle call, up go their trunks --"</p>
<p>"Short Arm inspection?" says Lewis.</p>
<p>Coli froze: not another word would he say. Try as we could. &ndash; Lewis is always damned funny but he had been surpassing himself at Colis' expense. &ndash; not another word could we get from Coli.  Poor Lewis was nearly in tears -- as were we -- but Coli was firm.</p>
<p>4.<br/> Coli's famous for several oaths and mannerisms. &ndash; he's a lewd old man in first stages of senile decay. "Tickled &ndash; to - death" an invariable reply when you say. "Good day brother! (Brother because its his own especial property --<br/>"A-men Brother &ndash; Tickled to &ndash; death".</p>
<p>"Gawd stone me: and " Gawd bless me" and " xxxx even.  He also sings a song &ndash; "all soldiers never die".</p>
<p>All soldiers never die &ndash; never die never die<br/>All soldiers never die, they fade away.</p>
<p>The meaning's obscure but supposed to be funny.</p>
<p>A number of chaps seem to possess copyrighted oaths &ndash; Roach &ndash; "For true" or with more expression for special occasions (the rule) " Too bloody true."</p>
<p>Hungerford's and Martins by adoption &ndash; "My Luck" !  With George "My Luck" is like 'Am Roses', "Golly!"</p>
<p>5.<br/>Last night I wondered how it was that Bill wasn't out with Smithy &ndash; Smithy hadn't evidently waited for Bill and had gone on to a football match. &ndash; hence the coldness. The row raised a humorously cynical devil in Bill while Smithy was something like the night he had the Moet and Chand.  - "Fair dinkum,' Bill I <u>am</u> Giddy."" - and then the attack of malaria afterwards. Bill started by damning Home Rule because of the reports in yesterdays papers &ndash; and Smithy objected; Peach added fuel to the fire by siding with Bill  - and Smithy became pathetically funny.</p>
<p>At "Lights out" Smithy chucked a boot at the candle and knocked it into Bill"s cap: five minutes later there was the smell of something burning. Smithy became anxious and Peachy irritable: Bills cap was burning: but Bill was comfortable under the blanket.  "xxxx it!" says Bill.  Put it out Bill, it"ll burn!" anxiously from Smithy.</p>
<p>"Let it!" says Bill.</p>
<p>Peach and Smithy became doubly anxious and finally said Bill to complain &ndash; "Its like 'ome Rule and Ireland &ndash; I never started the xxxxxxx thing!"  Anyhow I"ll get a new cap. &ndash; and if it its only a little 'ole, I wont, so I"m goin" to be like the Q.M.!"</p>
<p>(There"d been a fire a couple of days ago in the store and X"s sponsors all veered in favour of condemning Q.M. &ndash; it was to cover shortages. It was hard times though that the fire was put out too soon.</p>
<p>This morning at Mess they tried to get Smithy going on Ireland, but it wasn"t any good.</p>
<p>Damn the English, but its rotten having to try siding with Ireland &ndash; and the [indecipherable] to have to side with Mick Rooney.</p>
