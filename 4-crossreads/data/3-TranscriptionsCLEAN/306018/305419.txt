  
 April 1917 hardly a pleasure trip.  The dust was blinding & choking & the halts & interruptions frequent.  In addition the night was cold & we were all tired.  We watered in the Wadi & it was just then 2 enemy aeroplanes spotted us & down came the bombs.  One killed & wounded 20 men & 18 horses, most of them belonging to Brigade Headquarters.  The day  Monday  Tuesday 17th was very hot with hardly a breath of air.  We got no time to boil any tea & nearly everyone was suffering a good deal. 
 After frequent halts of varying lengths we got into touch with the Turks near Abu Hareira there was a bit of a skirmish & some artillery fire.  We got a good well with splendid water.  After dark we came back & camped near the Wadi.  It was 11.30 when we got to sleep. 
 Wednesday 18th We were out again at daylight, watered our horses & managed to get a shave & a wash.  A plane came over & dropped more bombs but did no damage.  We went out again towards Abu Hareira, got in touch with the Turks & stayed there till dark.
