 Monday 27 May 1917 [1918] Sultan paid his first to Alex. &amp; great &amp; gaudy decorations are in the streets, crowds of people, very cosmopolitan of course. Went 19th G.H. 11.30 a.m., saw C.O. &amp; discharged &amp; to return 27th G.H. on Friday, 31st.  Shock is too much for me to speak so say, "yes Capt." &amp; retire.  Walked down Rue Rosette then gharry to Red X home, lunch, then Khedivial Hotel, met S. Roberts, bathe Stanley Bay &amp; lovely sunset.  News of transport torpedoed 12 m.n. yesterday, &amp; although over 1 hr. sinking men drowned. Letters from Mith, Nell, 3 boys, Eva, E. Brown, Kantara.  Home news still tragic as regards H.F. otherwise well.  Bathed in S. Bay 9 a.m., lovely fresh days.
