  
 Sunday 16 Church Parade 
 Monday 17 Picked for Guard this morning This means doing a bit of Guard training in the morning &  then  you have the afternoon off to get equipment etc ready Mount at 4 PM I was picked as being the best dressed so am let off Guard & am  to  Battalion Rumer for tomorrow It is a very wet night so am rather pleased to off Guard 
 Tuesday 18th The first run I got was to Hurilcotte with orders on an old Bike & was kept going fairly well all day. There are 4 perminent men on this job & the one new one each day - He gets the worst of it. If any of the clerks in Orderly Room have a message to send they call Runner & you go in & they say 'Here take this. If the Major wants it done He comes out & says Will you take this to so & so please
