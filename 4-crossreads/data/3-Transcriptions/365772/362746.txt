<p>I am enclosing a couple of postcards one for Mother. This show was on while I was in London, I saw the last two performances &amp; it was excellent, we used a deserted French concert hall &amp; had the assistance of the Y.M.C.A. for lighting &amp; piano.<br/>By the bye I met my old Manager Carl Cameron the other day he is a private in 18th Bn.<br/>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had a great yam with him over old times etc.<br/>Ken</p>
