<p>25th. When we fell in last night to go on fatigue, the weather looked very threatening, so they phoned down from Headquarters for it to be postponed, &amp; we were to hold ourselve's in readiness, so at 2 oclock this morning we were pulled out of our beds, the whole company, &amp; marched off to the joint where we were to do our job, the work in question turned out to be trench digging &amp; parapet building they are building a place to train bombers &amp; raiding parties for their work, the place selected for this is fair in the middle of a nice crop of wheat it doe's seem a shame to spoil a good crop like we are but of course the farmer will get compensation, &amp; another thing practically all of the ground here is under</p>
