<p>Reveille at 5.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Lifeboat drill at 10 clock</p>
<p>Took full squad at physical drill at 1 oclock &ndash; other wise nothing doing.  Wrote to Lily &amp; Rita and [indecipherable] few notes in notebook.  Had a chat with interpreters &amp; fellow from flying corps who gave interesting account of death of officer by burning (aeroplane). It is particularly noticeable how much more friendly the feeling amongst the men on board this ship is than on the trip from Australia.  We are very near to the [indecipherable] of anchor now.</p>
