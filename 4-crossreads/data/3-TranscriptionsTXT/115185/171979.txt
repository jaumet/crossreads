3 - working under me and three orderlies and an orderly in the majors consulting room.I have not had any letters from Gibson but I expect he has written to you the girls & Isoult - of course I think he could not have a better wife than Isoult will make and I like her very much - and it is nice that she & the girls are friends which may help Gibson a lot. Poor darling, I hope all will be well. I know you will have many fears and qualms about the future. I have not heard from J & R. for some time. I hope grandmother is alright. I know how sad precious Mother this anxiety is for you - and the awful war and the worry having the girls so far away - and So many things to worry about the rest of your children. I love the long letters from Con. They are very interesting to me and so apart from war. Everything is veiled in mystery here
