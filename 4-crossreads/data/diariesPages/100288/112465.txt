Water fatigue. General Godley staff visited here this morning to inspect 59th 60th Btns.
Grenadiers of Infantry Btns spent some time in bomb throwing practice, to the rear of our lines this morning; caused quite a sensation. Officially reported that General Townsend, with 2900 British Troops 6000 Indians has surrendered after holding out for over four months. Caused quite a depressed feeling among the boys here
