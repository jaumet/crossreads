Dear Dad, Mum & George,
I have very little to write about after a very quiet week.  I have been writing letters every night except Tuesday.  I went into Salisbury on that day to see the procession from the Infirmary to the Cathedral, a ceremony which has been in vogue since the 17th Century or so.  It was a very poor show this year, a few Police, the Mayor & His Satellites, Robes, maces & wigs in evidence, especially the Blighter that fined me 2/6 for no back light,
