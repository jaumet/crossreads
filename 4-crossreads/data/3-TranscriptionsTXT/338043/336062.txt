 It will suffice to say that we achieved our object in view &ndash; after which we marched along the Boulevards with French, British, Australian, American Flags to the accompaniement of cornets, bagpipes, drums etc. and singing the "Marseillaise" and "Australia Will be There" &ndash; So ends in a happy fashion a year of bloodshed, sorrow, Victory &amp; Peace. A Happy New Year to All.
