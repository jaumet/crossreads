<p>being bombarded. It becomes quite exciting to watch these bombardments especially when these shells seem to strike perilously near the 'plane. From the distance where we are one often thinks that a shell has burst right on to a 'plane but up to the present I have not seen a plane brought down by this means.</p>
<p>May 22nd. Monday<br/>A few pneumonia cases in Ward. Kept busy.</p>
<p>Fine weather. Had the afternoon off duty. This I spent washing my clothes and tidying up things generally.</p>
<p>Heavy rain this evening. Had a talk with an old Frenchman who keeps a beautiful vegetable garden in which he takes a great pride spending his time working early and late in it.</p>
<p>He could not talk a word of English but I managed by means of my broken French to have a pleasant and interesting conversation with him.</p>
<p>I happen to have a pipe in my mouth and our conversation started from the point of good and bad tobacco. He said that he had been a Cuirrusier or mounted soldiers in his early days.</p>
<p>He had a garden of about three acres and it was so well kept and the vegetables were so good it was a real pleasure to look at it. The rows of plants were as straight as a die. It was in his garden that the bomb dropped the other week</p>
