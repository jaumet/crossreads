  
 Owing to lack of accommodation, a few of us had to sleep in the open, with only two blankets & a waterproof. 
 25: Bitterly cold & raining heavily.  The boys had not received their parcels or billies, so we had bully & rice for lunch.  Had not been paid for a month & everyone else was bankrupt.  Worst Xmas I have ever spent & had to turn in under wet blankets.  Goodness knows when we will get away from here, as all troops from Gallipoli are going daily. 
 31st:  Camp fire concert;  Gen. Forsyth presiding & some of the nurses in the audience.  Boys had a fine days football & sports, ending up with a huge log fire at night.  Stayed up to welcome in the new year.
