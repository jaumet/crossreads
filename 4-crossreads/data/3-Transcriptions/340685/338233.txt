<p>Only got one letter to C.M.B. written. Went on from 7 &ndash; 9 and after making some of the cocoa sent me we decided to have 4 hour shifts which meant I could have a good nights rest until 5 in the morning.<br/>4.9.16 had to call the cooks at 5.30 and the sergeant major and at 7.30 was relieved for half an hour to get breakfast and went off guard at 9.15 and was off the rest of the morning which I filled in by getting things straight. Got a parcel of cake and fruit and chocolates from Auntie Sarah. Poperinghe was shelled yesterday causing several casualties. Hook and Watson came to reinforce our section with Anderson. In the afternoon we again carried on with the blinds and got a few more done. The evening wrote some more letters and had a good sleep. Still cloudy and raining.<br/>5.9.16 This morning put on as assistant sawyer and at 9 couldn't get anyone to do the job did it myself and cut up timber to size Ludlow acting as assistant. One saw got put out of action through a screw coming loose and the teeth grating on the framework but I soon got going well. In the afternoon I was tightening up a nut when the spanner slipped and my hand fell on the saw luckily not rotating. It cut a deep piece of skin out and it bled profusely but didn't hurt in the least and I got Allison to dress it for me with iodine and again later after I had had a wash. Couldn't write comfortably so went to bed early and slept beautifully. Nos 1 &amp; 4 sections went out to Ypres to make winter dugouts living in cellars in Ypres and maybe out 2 months. They took their packs and went out at 8 o'clock in motor omnibuses. Gillett &amp; MacNamara went as surveyors. Still raining pretty hard and they must have had a bad trip. The cyclists with the provisions had gone out the previous night.<br/>6.9.16 No first parade as it was very foggy and inclined to be wet so stayed in bed until breakfast. Hand a bit aching but not so much as it might. Went on sawing but not very much to do this morning and I am trying to write letters in the intervals.<br/>7.9.16 &amp; 8.9.16 Usual sawing. Working hard all day to-day and put through 2000 ft of uncut timber. Saw working better. Some infantry about 5 turned up as rough carpenters this afternoon and carried logs for us. From 12th Batt. Had a hot bath and finished letter to father. Plenty of work and very little time for own pursuits. Paid this evening</p>
