 Not so good last night but Sisters gave me a sleeping TOT &amp; put me in a fresh Bed &amp; I soon went off-  This is a big ward &amp; now holds 30 officers   People have brought Flowers &amp; are very good. News in the Paper is good everything is going right &amp; I feel we have won at last, only a matter of time now. The papers now give the ANZACS credit for the recent fight-  We the LH ANZACS did it helped by the Artillery of course.  Several officers are insensible all night you can hear them rambling about Mother [indecipherable]
