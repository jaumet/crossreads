My darling Eddy,
So pleased to get your lovely letters and drawings. I have just received the Photo of you, Mummie   &  Grandma. You seems to be growing a very big boy. I shall hardly know you when I return. Mummie   &  Grand,a look very well. I shall get frames for them.
You must have had a beautiful birthday and what a lot of presents you got. You are quite a soldier now with your sword   &  gun. Fondest love   &  kisses From Auntie Eadle XXXXXXXXXXXX
