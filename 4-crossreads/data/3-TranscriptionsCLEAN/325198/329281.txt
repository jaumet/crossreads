  
 6 April, 1916 Selhai [Salhia] It was a day of fixing up to day, we got our lines tidied & levelled off & now everything looks spick & span, our tent also is more comfortable we scraped off all the loose sand & damped it.  The tucker is a bit light bully & a little bread it will be alright to morrow though, I expect.  Its far more comfortable in the mess sheds though, we have a shed to each squadron so there are four decent sized tables to each troop & that is not too bad.  There is a good deal of bother about the gear on the lines, A squadron declares that B & C are pinching all its stuff while B swears that A & C have got down on it for its own - then C is complaining that B & A are at its gear so that things are sort of a bit mixed - We are all wondering what is next.  Many rumours are afloat, one being that all the Mounted Div is to come down here.  There is a big mail in I believe, hope its true.
