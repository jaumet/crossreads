& since my coming have taken things easily & much appreciate the quiet & the surroundings in a country that is British & speaks one's own tongue.  The contrast between the English & French towns is very noticeable.  I am going to Glasgow on Monday & am returning to London on Wednesday & then back again to the Front.The "push" that I spoke of earlier in this record has taken place & so far has resulted in the capture of Messines & the Ridge & 7000 prisoners.  My old unit has been in the thick of it.  How I would have loved to have been there with them.  I am anxiously watching for the casualty returns
