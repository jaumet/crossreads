<p>This is not confined to the Australian papers, the same sloppy</p>
<p>nonsense being served up to readers of the British journals.</p>
<p>This morning we received a batch of Sydney Morning Heralds</p>
<p>published just at the time the Australians went into the line in</p>
<p>France and we spent an hour or two laughing over the utter rot</p>
<p>about the doings of the Anzacs in the eyes of the World.&nbsp; One</p>
<p>cable said that a farmer behind the line employed a white horse</p>
<p>to plow with and it was suspected that he somehow used this white</p>
<p>horse as a medium for signalling information to the enemy, so the</p>
<p>Anzacs went out one night and painted the horse a red<sub>^</sub><sup>d</sup>ish brown!</p>
<p>Other cables told of notices put up by the Germans which were</p>
<p>purely imaginary and of fights which never took place.&nbsp; It is</p>
<p>a wonder they did not repeat the old Gallipoli tale of pitching</p>
<p>Germans out of trenches on the end of bayonets.&nbsp; The Australian</p>

<p>that the whole Australian army only holds a bit of the line equal</p>
<p>to the distance from the Central Station to Petersham.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>Canadians, who are fine soldiers, must feel very hurt at all this</p>
<p>undue attention paid to the Australians.&nbsp; The Canadians are in</p>
<p>one of the toughest portions of the line near Ypres, they bore</p>
<p>the brunt of the first gas attack ever delivered, and have since</p>
<p>been in every important engagement in that district and yet you</p>
<p>seldom see their name mentioned - except in the casuality lists</p>
<p>where they are big subscribers.&nbsp; The cables told you that the</p>
<p>Australians were allotted to one of the most important sections</p>
<p>of the line and that &quot;they were proud and pleased to be paid</p>
<p>the compliment as it was their one desire to be where the</p>
<p>fighting is thickest.&quot;&nbsp; As a matter of fact out section had</p>
