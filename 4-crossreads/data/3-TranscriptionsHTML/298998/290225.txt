<p>much worse than in this filthy place. The daily sight of sick, wounded and dying men is horribly depressing. My nerves are in a frightful state and undoubtedly a change of air and surroundings will improve my health. Most of my friends, made during the last few months, have long since gone to Altdamn. One is forbidden to write to anybody in Germany.</p>
<p>2nd-8th    The specialist accompanied by the C.O. made the weekly tour. The latter examined the food, tasted all soups and appeared quite satisfied. The catering is in the hands of the proprietor, who, by the way, is an old Australian veteran,   He speaks excellent English, but seldom condescends to converse with a prisoner. He approached me several days ago and asked me where I hailed from. He spoke of many Australian towns and told me that he had spent 18 years in Australia; most of them in Victoria. He returned to Hunland a few months prior to the outbreak of hostilities. He is Hun to the core and will never venture to speak unless he knows the coast is clear. I was very astonished, when he told me of his experiences in Victoria. I avoid the man when possible as he obviously wishes to extract information in the usual Hun manner.</p>
<p>9th. I was marked out today. I expect to leave here shortly. My Hun opponent has gained his object; that, however, is immaterial to me.</p>
<p>10th-17th. My wound has healed. The specialist has examined my leg closely and expressed much satisfaction. He actually smiled when he looked at the wound; he jabbered something unintelligible to me. He hates English men and has on all occasions avoided us as much as possible. He especially detests our officers; on one occasion, when an English Flying officer entered the operating theatre (whilst I was awaiting attention) and spoke to him, he promptly turned his back, looking hatefully at those standing by. Ah well!   What else could one expect from a Hun?</p>
<p>17th. I donned my prisoner's uniform, and prepared myself for departure to Altdamn. The uniform is forwarded from England, but is made according to Hun specifications. The cap is black, with broad brown band; coat, black with broad brown armlet; trousers black and decorated with a huge brown strip on each leg.</p>
