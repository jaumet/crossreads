<p>November 28<br/>151.<br/>T.L.S. Nov. 22, from Frank Richard's column of books.. 'We hear a great deal of a revival of interest in Poetry.  Certain books have gone into a surprising number of editions.  I wonder of what numbers those editions consist?  In one case I hear of a reputation being based on edition after edition, each consisting of 200 copies.  Of Thomas Burke's "London Lamps" I printed 500, and the ed. is nearly exhausted, it is being reprinted.  Of Cecil Roberts' "Twenty Six Poems" I printed 750.'  "London Lamps" was a fine little collection:  sent over to me by Gerald&hellip;  must write to him, but have lost definite address:  will use A.F.C&hellip;</p>

<p>Basil Burdett up from Samur &ndash; from the A.D.M.S's office:  spoke to him of draftsman at H.Qtrs&hellip;  Will later apply for next vacancy.. it will be a good disciplining for me, and there'll be the chance perhaps of a bit of fagging for R.A.D.A. Intermediate and finals.  No mail today&hellip;</p>
