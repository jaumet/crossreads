<p>at Victoria Station London just on 3 pm.  Marched to Horseferry Road where I went through the usual red tape.  Went to clothing store &amp; obtained new uniform.  Clear of all trouble about 6 pm, hailed taxi &amp; flew up to Shaftesbury Hotel where we fixed up accomodation.  Had tea &amp; after went round to "Hippodrome" where "Zig Zag" was staged, a fine entertainment.  Arrived back fairly late to our quarters, but wrote home before retiring, thus ended the 1st day of our leave.</p>
<p>Thursday 16.8.17<br/>Went to Horseferry Road to draw money, would have had to wait too long last evening. Went to Tower of London &amp; with the aid of the guards employed there</p>
