<p>The Frenchman is superficially polite but under the surface he lacks all the finer feeling for his women that we possess He will thrust her out of his way in a rush for seats.

<p>After dinner to night Clements intends to visit Nostre Rogis &amp; I dig out Cailloud to accompany us. After a drink of wine in his atelier we set off &amp; visit Nostre Logis</p>

This is my every day fare &amp; perhaps is not sufficient but if I do not live in this manner I should have no money</p>
