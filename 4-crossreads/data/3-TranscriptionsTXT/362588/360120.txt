 My dear Judge 
 As stretcher bearers are allowed practically anywhere I often take a trip to other portions of our front &amp; when out last Wednesday heard that your boy's battalion was in one of the gulleys, thinking you would like to hear of him I dug him up from a temporary home in a Turkish hillside.  You will be glad to know that he looks in good trim being very brown &amp; seemed to be quite at home in what are undoubtedly novel surroundings.  There was very heavy firing on that flank last night so I presume his company has been action.  Also ran across Jim McManamey &amp; a mile or so further on saw W.S. Hinton, A.J. McDonald (Solicitor), Caesar Lucas, Jack Maughan (of Norton Smith) and my nephew Wilfred Addison (who was killed next morning).  Wilkie MacKenzie &amp; Frank Coen are on the Peninsula &amp; I shall look them up when possible.  After some months here feel O.K. and being hit by a number of stones scattered by a bursting shell is the only incident so far that could shake the confidence of the A.M.P. Society in their various silks over my life.  The weather is rapidly becoming colder &amp; thick socks &amp; underwear will be appreciated very shortly. 
 With kindest regards &amp; remember me to Byrne, Yours sincerely Chas. G. Addison.
