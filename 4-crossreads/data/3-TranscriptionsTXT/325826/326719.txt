 3.  Every little bit of home news however small or detaily is most welcome when one is in a heathen place like this.  What a tiny family you are again, I do hope you will be able to take things a bit more easily little Mother, you must have had such a fearful lot to do this summer, you have had the whole family of us home at one time or another haven't you? While I think of it, we got a little birthday reminder for each of you the other day in Cairo &amp; will be posting them together.  They will be fearfully late I know but you can pretend they aren't, can't you? I have been in Cairo two Sundays &amp; each time have been to the two Sunday services at the Methodist Church, the first time by myself the second with Rid.  The morning services are very small, about 120 or 30 soldiers &amp; two or three civilians, but the evening ones are fine about 250 soldiers &amp; just about a dozen others.  Yesterday in the morning though such a small attendance we had a choice sermon &amp; Rid was delighted over it but at night we had another chaplain &amp; it was disappointingly poor.  The former Sunday it had been the other way round &amp; I had had quite a treat of a sermon at night.  Services are at 11 a.m. &amp; 6.30 p.m. We have had a couple of nice little outings though have taken things fairly quietly, one morning it looked as if Rid's throat were going to be giving trouble again &amp; I kept him in bed till lunch time.  However with a gargle &amp; tannin it seems to have been warded off, but shows that he is not properly right yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall both be glad to have some finality about his going, in one sense, for he is rather afraid that they may think he is taking advantage of the leave &amp; is getting rather restless, on the other hand when the summons does come it
