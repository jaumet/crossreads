 Fri. Ap. 26  -  Sutton Veny Hosp. 
 Have had a severe cold this last few days and this morning went on sick parade. Capt. McLennan said I was to go to Hosp. 
 Came away in a car to Sutton Veny Hospital and am in 13 Bed 19 Ward. Tucker not Bad. 
 Sat. 29.  Doctor came round this morning and gave me a thoro' overhauling. Says I've got Dilated Heart. 
 Weather glorious. 
 The Germans have captured Kemmel Hill. 
 Ward 19. Sunday Apr. 28 Dull day. Little did I expect to spend today in Hospital. This is a very fine ward with about 30 Beds. The nurses are most pleasant. Food good and fairly plentiful. 
 There is a notice just outside the ward door which says in English and German "The Sentry has orders to shoot any man crossing this wire". It appears that some time ago this ward was occupied by German prisoners. 
 Wish I had a Pen so that I could write to B.E. She will wonder what the dickens has gone wrong. 
 Wrote Letter 18 to B.E. 
 The chap in the next Bed lent me his Pen, so now I can carry on the Good work.
