<p>but they had no luck.  Madame had been on a smuggling expedition to Belgium that day and brought back about a Bolster full of Tobacco.</p>
<p>Saturday, 25-1-19<br/>Sent P.Cs to Dixon &amp; Clare last night.  We have had a steady heavy Frost for the last few days.  There are still odd casualties caused by "Duds" at the Station.</p>
<p>Sunday, 26-1-19<br/>Nice heavy fall of snow today.  I went out yesterday with a four-wheel drive Lorry &amp; done 3 trips for 64 lamp sockets.  I have been out with motors &amp; crews of prisoners getting gear for the last 4 days.  In one case I went out with a Brigadier and Colonel to select gear for a picture show.</p>
<p>Monday 27-1<br/>I met E. Huxley at the dance last night.  He is a Sergt. in the 5th Div.  He told me that he had a good spin having been in England at least two years as an Instructor, on further conversation I found out the he was the Electrician <strike>who</strike> for whom the Picture Show outfit was being selected by [indecipherable] yesterday.  He didn't like the Unit I selected so I had to take him today to a big Workshops and turn him loose.  They produced a couple of machines and were testing them for him when I left him.  I had a gang of Huns and an F.W.D. to look after as well so I couldn't spare much time.</p>
