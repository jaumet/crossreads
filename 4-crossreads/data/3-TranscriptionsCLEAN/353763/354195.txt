  
 A Chinese tailor has been off & I've ordered some white clothes  -  He's the thinnest   -  most drawn out, almond eyed, son of China I've seen  -  Got my washing done too - 3/6 per dozen  -  I only put in big things & made up the dozen with handkerchiefs  -  I am wearing a soft shirt - open at neck - no tie - Kharki pants & a holland coat with my shoulder straps  -  I borrowed the latter from a brother officer  -  Naval men are splendid lenders also borrowers  -  Not a word of AE1  -  They're gone  -  We've abandoned hope  -  Poor chaps  -  All we can do is to help their families & dependents  -  35 men wiped out in one act & no one has any idea  how  & that's the worry  -  The water is too deep even if the spot were located - which it isn't -The navy cant draw any lesson  -  AE2 isnt allowed out by herself now  -  We shall be here sometime  -  I'm one of the contented ones  -  I wish to happen what does happen  -  I read - keep my eyes open - listen  -  I cant talk much because my point of view on very many things is not that of the others  -  I'm Australian & very democratic  -  However we all pull splendidly together & really like each other & I'm only one in a  mob
