17 April 1918 WednesdayIn pickle bottles, I have Cyclamen & wild Maidenhair Fern, Iris, Tulips, Lavender, but summer is coming & all are drying up.  Had dinner with the Military Governor a Sergeant Major [indecipherable] of man but at least both speak English.  Gold & silver coins are scarce & some of the Jews are very clever at trying to get the former, the Arabs & others never give change say they have not, in fact the first English words many learn are NO CHANGE.
