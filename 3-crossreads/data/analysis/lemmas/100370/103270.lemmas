 railway is cut yet or not we have not heard , but Johnni is go back just as fast as he can go . He seem to have no desir to fight . On the Jordan a coupl of day ago two troop , 60 men at the most , captur 400 Turk . They seem to be just lay down their arm and surrend , glad , appar to be out of the fight . They are veri miser cloth , and have a weak emaci appear , as though they were half-starv . One lot of about 500 who pass us on the Jordan were inde famish with thirst and hunger . I have seen stock in drought-tim in Australia go mad and rush water , but these Turk were quit as bad . They just fought for a place , and threw themselv into the stream and drank with their face in it , like beast . A Division Command and his staff went through on the same day , the 22nd . We have had a weari time in the saddl . We left Wadi Es Sultan at about 8 P.M. on the 21st , reach Wadi Oajah about 11 P.M. , were on the way again at 8 A.M. on the 22nd and rode without a halt , except for water till 2-30 P.M.

We move on again " some time " today bound for " somewher " . 25th We left Es Salt on the 24th pass through the town on the way to Amman . The road through the town is strewn with the flotsam and jetsam of battl . Dead Turk , some dread mutil by bomb , and dead mule , camel and hors , with a tremend litter of broken transport and some gun , line the way fill the air with an indescrib stench , and bring home to one with increas forc what an uncivil , damnabl thing modern " Civil " warfar is , and the effect of war on men who can estim . Ly sprawl and broken in the roadsid , have die a horribl death , one see a Dead human , probabl careless roll to the side to avoid be ridden over , and now be cover by the dust of the endless traffic and one has littl more than a glanc in pass , and certain no time for piti to bestow on him . When there is time , when men are not too busi make other like him , he will be buri . We are now Es Salt is a town of , in normal time , some 15,000 peopl but is practic desert now .
