<p>17-10-16<br/>Left Ypres at about 6.0 P.M. &amp; walked to Montreal Camp.  This Ypres Salient must be a long one.  We were walking between two rows of Flares for about 3 miles.  We were not allowed to smoke or show lights of any description.  Each man carried 2 blankets &amp; 3 helmets in addition to winter underclothing.  Trains passed us on the salient going both ways one with a flaming Fire Box &amp; yet we dared not show a light.  We arrived at Montreal at about 8.15 P.M.  Beginning to get cold now.  We marched into Ypres along the same road in daylight in columns of four.  lost my Pay Book last night.  This camp is near Dickebush Hill 63 is plainly visible so also is the Windmill Hill alongside.  A curious effect on these night marches is the sparking of the iron shod Boots of the Soldiers on the cobble Stones.</p>
<p>19-11[10]-16<br/>Still at Montreal Camp.  Very sloppy.  move tomorrow I believe.</p>
<p>20-11[10]-16<br/>Keen frost this morning.  moving out.  Halted at Midday at an Aero School near Abeele.  The Aviators gave us a fine display looping the loop.  Banking &amp; diving just on to us apparently trying to frighten us.</p>
