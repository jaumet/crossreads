June 191618th    Sunday to-day & a "real Sunday" too.  We did not get up until after 1 P.M., due no-doubt, to the beds we slept in, which were beautifully comfortable after hard boards on Salisbury Plain.  We lost no time in getting out when we discovered the time & after dinner we "buzzed" around the town & saw most of the interesting features of London. including Westminster Abby where we spent about 3/4 of an hour.  We were shown all over the Abby by had a guide who explained everything to us.  Most of the more valuable curios have been removed for safety & a great number of the old ornamentations & toombs are covered with sandbags.
