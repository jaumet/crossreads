Aout 4Nos 2 & 4 Sec. had route march in morning through Blaringham & Ebblinghem - about 9 miles.
Aout 5No. 2 Sec. Duty sec. today & most of us got leave to St Omer. I am writing in the garden or park there now & listening to a Welsh band. Gardens appear to be very nice & there & there appear to be a heterogenious crowd gathered. Military & civilian Australians including nurses making things look quite gay with their red capes. There also are French English & Portuguese soldiers & other varieties - officers of apparently all nationalities & rank. To my way of thinking the best of all are the Australians & Jocks. The Australian nurses are very plain of feature but they are a little bit of home. The Welsh band's mostly music but not very enjoyable. Had tea & returned back to billet arriving about 9p.m.
