 25 January, 1916 Maadi I rode my mare out this morning, she went well &amp; I think her leg will be alright now &ndash; We did some fast "dismount for action" work, it was quite exciting at times, we had a great ride across the desert to shelter when a shower came on us.  This afternoon we got paid, its fine to feel independent once more &amp; to be able to buy ones own smokes.  Johno received a parcel &amp; we had another blow out after dinner of sausages tomatoes, asparagus, &amp; cake.  I am on picquet, they are coming the old trick of putting us L.Corps on as troopers again.  It has been cold today &amp; some sleet fell at one time &ndash; nearly all the boys are in town to night. I have put in for a 12 noon pass for tomorrow, hope that I get it.  We are supposed to leave on Friday, that is the latest.
