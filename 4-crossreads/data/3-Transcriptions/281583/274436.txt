<p>21.11.16 Tuesday<br/> &amp; 22.11.16   Wednesday</p>
<p>Both these days and nights have been by far the worst I have as yet experienced &amp; tonight bids fair to out rival both. To begin with I have had no sleep for two nights &amp; days owing to pressure of work.</p>
<p>On the night of the 21st our train was derailed about 3 miles this side of Albert &amp; consequently we had to set about getting the supplies up to Montauban. This was finished after working all night &amp; after having breakfast we again turned to &amp; issued . During the day we received notification that we &amp; all the other Divisions would receive our supplies per Motor column on account of the railway break down. After waiting until 10pm I posted a guard &amp; turned in but had not rested 15 minutes before I was warned that the column had been sighted. Then began a night which licked all creation. The Motor Column which consisted of 150 lorries had become hopelessly mixed &amp; was strung out for miles &amp; was arriving in batches of [indecipherable] with all Divisional supplies also mixed. Our only alternative was to throw it out on the side of the road &amp; try &amp; sort out in the morning which we started to do. At this junction a lorrrie skidded in the mud &amp; became fast on the [indecipherable] of the road &amp; blocked the traffic. We got this unloaded</p>
