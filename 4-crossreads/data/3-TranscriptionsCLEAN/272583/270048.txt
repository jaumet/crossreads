There we unloaded horses, and proceeded to Kasse-el-Nil barracks which is about a mile from the station where we watered them.Started for Mena at 8.45. It was the worse march I have been on but the scenery round about was gorgeous  Everyone including officers were tired and exausted from want of food and sleep when we arrived at Mena a distance of 11 miles from Cairo, at 9.30 am.More fooling about till 11.30 am. At 12.30 we had some dry bread and cheese. Plenty of work till 6 pm then bless me if I was not put on picquet. The horses were pretty bad and were continuously breaking loose.13th64 hours without sleep and only bread and cheese.
