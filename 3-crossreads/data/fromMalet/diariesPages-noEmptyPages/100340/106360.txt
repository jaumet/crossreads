everybody was well oiled well you can imagine the scenes. Everyone trying to rag on the grass falling all over each other. It was indeed a very merry evening.Do not know what to think about the past parcel it may have been yours. At any rate there were two books two bottles of home made jam tin of salmon two tins of sugar a pair of sox. It was most welcome but I do wish they would put a slip of paper in it so as I will know who it is from. Do not be at all surprised if you don't hear from me for a month as we are going up the line tonight I have no envelopes left cannot buy any for love nor money
