<p>FEBRUARY 1917</p>
<p>22 THURSDAY</p>
<p>Fine but dull &amp; misty. Our section</p>
<p>[team?] was called out at 2 AM to</p>
<p>take our guns down to a sniping</p>
<p>position &amp; I was one of those</p>
<p>that had to go. We went down</p>
<p>to the same position as last time.</p>
<p>Our harness got in a hell of a</p>
<p>mess in the mud &amp; the horses</p>
<p>also, &amp; I was all day cleaning</p>
<p>mine, but got most of it clean.</p>
