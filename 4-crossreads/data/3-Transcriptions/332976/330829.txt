<p>March 1917<br/>30th.   Early this morning I was instructed to take a party of seven sappers &amp; L. Cpl Durkin to Bernafay Wood &amp; report to the adjutant at "C.R.E."   We left Villers-Au-Floss at about 8.30 a.m. with all our gear a proceeded on our journey.   At Beaulencourt we got a truck on which we loaded our gear, and took it along the "light railway" as far as Ginchy, &amp; from there we had to carry it to Bernafay Wood &amp; arrived at H.Q. about 4 P.M.<br/>It had been raining nearly all day &amp; we were all the worse for a wetting &amp; tired out.   After settling down I received instructions as to the work we are to do, to the effect that in the morning we are to dismantle a number of<br/>"Bow Huts"</p>
