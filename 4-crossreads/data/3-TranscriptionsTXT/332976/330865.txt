May 191727th   Yesterday & to-day we have been doing "barbed wire entanglements" in the morning & have had the afternoon off.We were playing football & cricket in the yesterday afternoon & this afternoon the 20th Division who are relieving us on this sector, gave a concert in the paddock behind the old Chatteau ruins.   It was a most brilliant success & we enjoyed it thoroughly.   The artists were in "periot" costume, & all are members of the various units of the Division.   The orchestra band of the Div. was in attendance as well as the piano, & they antisipate holding the show every evening free to all comers.
