 November 1916 21st (continued)    communication with the supports are about 50 yds to our  left  Right.  In to-day's orders  I was gazetted Lance-Corporal. 22nd   Last night two sappers &amp; myself took a fatigue party of about a hundred infantry of the 8th Brigade to the supports with "duck Walks &amp; sandbags.  Fritz was shelling  but  heavily but we only had two casualties. This afternoon I went down with another corporal to locate a new communication trench which we are to continue making &amp; we spent about half an hour in the front line.  We witnessed some fine air duels &amp; saw two of Fritzes planes brought down.
