 Being tired after yesterday's long ride I was not astir until about noon when we dined pleasantly at our mess.   The day was close and oppressive so I returned to my billet and went to sleep.   A thunderstorm blew up and very heavy rain fell for an hour after which the sun came out again.   After mess I rode up to the line first calling in at our Transport.   A busy road is the main Amiens - Albert road and much transport was on the move.   Rode up to the high bank where A & B companies were camped and found everyone getting ready for the attack at dawn.   Evidently the men were full of fight as I saw two having a scrap with many preliminary challenges of "Hop out you bastard!" - and in a few hours they will both probably be poor dead souls in Hell!   Went to Battalion H.Q. and saw Matthews and Stewart.   All their arrangement were complete and the attackers were to move up to their Assembly places in about two hours time.   This morning our 18th Battn in broad daylight made for a Boche post they had located.   The German sentry had ample time to warn the garrison but simply put his hands up when our men were quite a distance away.   The result was that our men surprised the garrison - some asleep, some sunning themselves
