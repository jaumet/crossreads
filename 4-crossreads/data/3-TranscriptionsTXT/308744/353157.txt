 troops advancing up the EUPHRATES. Our machines &ndash; Pilots: Lieuts. S.A. Nunan and A.V. Tonkin, D.F.C. , Observers: Lieuts. C.J. Vyner and L.S. Climie &ndash; proceeded to AKHTERIN, ARCHE, BIRIJIK and VASLE. No troops were observed, but roads, rolling stock and bridges were reported on. On the 25th "A" Flight moved from HAMA back to RAYAK and at the end of the month 'C' Flight proceeded from HAIFA back to RAMLEH. 
 During December the remainder of the Squadron moved to RAMLEH where the unit remained until orders were received to proceed to KANTARA. 
 On December 1st, Lieut, Col. R. Williams D.S.O., O.B.E., assumed command of Palestine Brigade, Vice Brigadier General A.E. Borton was accompanied by Capt. R.M. Smith MC.  D.F.C. and Sgt. Mechanic J.M. Bennett and Air Mechanic W. Shiers of 1st Squadron, A.F.C. 
 On December 23rd a formation of seven machines flew from RAMLEH to CAIRO to take part in an aerial review held there in connection with the Armistice celebrations &ndash; Pilots: Lieut. Col. R. Williams, D.S.O., O.B.E., Lieuts. A.V. Tonkin, D.F.C. Capt. G.C. Peters D.F.C. Lieuts. H..S.R. Maughan, D.F.C., P.J. NcGinness, D.F.C., D.C.M., S.A. Nunan and E.S. Headlam. 
 A special trip to DAMASCUS and TADMORE was made on January 10th by Pilots:- Lieuts. S.A. Nunan and H.S. Harper, Observers: Lieuts. L.S. Climie and Air Mechanic E.T. Parr, with the object of selecting permanent landing grounds at those centres for use in connection with the CAIRO-BAGDAD route. They had a very adventurous journey, but ultimately completed their allocated task. TADMORE was about 220 miles from the RAMLEH Aerodrome and on the way out our machines encountered severe storms and dense clouds, and were twice forced to land in the desert and wait till these disturbances passed over. On the return journey the machines had to fly against a gale, which prevented them getting back to DAMASUCS before nightfall. One machine landed on the aerodrome there in the dark, without flares while the second (Lieut, Harper) ran out of petrol and was compelled to land in an orchard 6 miles East of DAMASCUS. Before he could take off again 12 trees had to be chopped down, and a track of wire netting strips laid over the soft muddy ground. In neither case was any damage done to the machines. 
 Towards to the end of January, orders were received to arrange to hand over all equipment to No.111 Squadron, R.A.F. to prepare for early departure to Australia. 
 The Squadron was relieved by No.111 Squadron, R.A.F. early in February, and on the 6th the whole of the personnel moved to KANTARA, where they remained till March 5th. On this date the unit embarked on H.M.A.T. 'Port Sydney) and sailed for Australia. 
 Before the Squadron embarked, it was inspected by the Commander-in-chief, General Sir Edmund Allenby, G.C.D., G.C.M.G., who expressed a wish to personally address the Officers and other members of the unit prior to their return to Australia. On February 19th he journeyed from HAIFA to KANTARA a distance of about 250 miles, with this special object. In Addressing the Squadron on parade, General Allenby said:- 
 "Major Addison, officers and men. It gives me considerable pleasure to have this opportunity of addressing you prior to your return to AUSTRALIA. We have just reached the end of the greatest war known to History. Today we see our enemies so thoroughly beaten that it will not be possible for them to renew hostilities against us. The operations in this theatre of the war have been an important factor in bringing about this victorious result. The victory gained in PALESTINE and SYRIA has been one of the
