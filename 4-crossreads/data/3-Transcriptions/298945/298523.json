<p>Here is what I have written in Bert Emmott's autograph album &ndash; my first original poem &ndash; least of all sonnet: &ndash;</p>
<p>"A topic sketch, I know, is what you fain<br/>Would have; yet I have thought 'twere better to<br/>Evolve some helping thought, to give to you &ndash;<br/>Clothed in rough chaff, &ndash; a simple little grain.<br/>On life, the calling which you choose, &ndash; or brain<br/>Or hand, if you success desire to woo,<br/>Demands you pass through tests: heights are taboo<br/>Unless the standard of each test you attain</p>
<p>So in the moral side of life you'll find<br/>Soul testing opposition, needing strength<br/>To overcome; after a fight, at length<br/>You'll reach a point &ndash; to failure half resigned<br/>Weakness will whisper to you: "Never mind".<br/>Fight on: that foe can ne'er be left behind."</p>
