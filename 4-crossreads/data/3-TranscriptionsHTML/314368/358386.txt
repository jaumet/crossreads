<p>you half a dozen or so photos of myself, taken by an amateur just outside the hospital. I don't think they are very good but they could have been worse. I was taken in my hospital uniform just coat and pants the dress is blue (fairly warm, and comfortable to knock about in) and white shirt and red tie.</p>
<p>Well mother, as soon as I have had my leave I will be able to give you a detailed account of my London experiences, so I shall have to sign off now.<br/>Trusting that this will find you and dad, and all the family OK, with best and fondest love to you all</p>
<p>Your loving Son<br/>Gordon</p>
