was that there was to be a roll call then parade each morning at 6.30 now this is a most unecessary thing for we are supposed to be in a Convalescent Camp, not a drill Barrack's, however no one turned out for it, so this afternoon all the Sgts including myself were marched into the O.C's office he thereupon started to lecture us about one thing another he in the end detailed a Sgt to each hut for the purpose of getting the men out of a morning, he detailed me to 17 Hut, I of course immediately objected for I have quite sufficient to do on my Dental job, after a little argument he struck me off gave it to Holland the R.S.M. of the 10th Battn.
