6-1-17Sat 6thHad a fine day for a change & an enemy 'plane with it, but she dropped no bombs & two of our 'planes lost no time in getting up after her chasing her away. Wint  went away early this morning; 6 Sqdn captured a Turkish gramaphone at Maghaba & the Dr has been using Turkish records on the officers machine this afternoon, they are rather queer productions, reminds one of the drinking shops of Cairo. Received a parcel from home today.
