  
 I didn't feel too strong so I just quietly walked to the old square with the Casuarinas on 3 sides where I saw the flag hoisted & had another look at it - It was quite quiet & very green - The Poincianas with their green flat tops flaring with red bloom attract your attention - Nature is revelling in the warmth & moisture  & Crotons & Mangoes & Euphorbias vie with each other in growth - At the P. Office skiving in & out in the small garden were a mob of small swifts or martins -  So  swift &  so  small - They looked to me at first like big butterflies - Tell Rawdon I heard a Cooee bird the other morning - He's an Indian migrant - a black cuckoo - Remember him at Gayndale -
