Zealander came &amp; offered one of his horses which [indecipherable] I rode to the Field Ambulance, was put on a Table, given a dose of ether &amp; bit of shell taken out, bandaged up, given a whisky &amp; cup of Bovril &amp; started for the Hospital &ndash; Here I am, Electric Fan is buzzing, clean sheets, flowers, music everything a man could wish for, &amp;the Turks were good [indecipherable]  to send me here We are in a big building Napoleon built for his soldiers long ago at Aygassom</p>
<p>[Margin Note]<br/>The papers will tell you about the fight, the Light Horse did it. It was their day out.</p>
