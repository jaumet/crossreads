<p>place. The men are awfully kind to me. One has offered to take me for a motor run nearly every morning since I have been on night duty but I have not been able to accept.<br/>To-morrow he is off to Alexandria but his car is not going for a day or two &ndash; so its to come at 9. a.m. for me to take Sister Murray &amp; I into Cario.<br/>Oh, on Monday-night, one of the patients said he had brought something from the zoo. for me. Well, I thought it was a joke but when I opened the parcel. It was a lovely gold braclet with two Elephants Heads as clasps. Such an uncommon one. He is another Englishman. Enlisted in Australia because he was there at the time. He is a fine big fellow, very fair straight hair &amp; a hard case &ndash; knows how to enjoy life. He has a sharpnel wound in his back, may be going to England soon. I'm always getting chocolate etc given me. To-night Major Hunt gave me a most beautiful box of sweets but I have not opened them yet. I'm too sleepy to write more. 3. 30. a.m. must walk about. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all  &amp;  hope you are all well.<br/>From Edith</p>
