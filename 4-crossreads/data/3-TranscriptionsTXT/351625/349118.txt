 number of British Tommies who are just from England, they say things are pretty tight in England and every thing is very expensive.  Durban is about the size of Newcastle but it is much prettier, seeing it from the sea it looks like a lot of white houses nestled amongst green trees.  The streets are fairly wide and they have double-decker electric trams which look  like  very funny. 
 Sunday night &ndash; We arrived off Capetown this afternoon and are at present anchored off Table bay.  The city is situated round the water surrounded by steep rocky mountains which rise straight up.  We have not been able to see the top of Table mountain as it has been surrounded by mist.  We hope to get on shore tomorrow even if it is only for a route march.  This bay is swarming with different kinds of sea birds and they swim and fly round the ship in thousands.  They are having a bit of a sing song at the piano tonight and if I could sing I'd go and join in. 
 17th &ndash; In a writing room in Capetown. We were let off at 1 p.m. today till 10.30 p.m.  So that we could behave ourselves the troops were detailed into parties of 10 and 12 with one N.C.O. in charge of each party and were supposed to keep together the whole time.  I had one party but as soon as we got away from the ship we all split up into parties of twos and threes and arranged to meet again at a certain spot to return to the ship, this is the way Australians treat a foolish order, especially as it shows they are not trusted in a town.  We haven't any idea how long we will stay here.  Capetown is a nice town larger and much busier than Durban, the trams are similar to those of that place, trains run all round the water amongst the shipping of which there seems to be a great deal.  This afternoon all the shops and hotels are closed.  I suppose they are frightened the troops will get unruly.  I have just found out they open at 2 p.m. today having been closed this morning for some recruiting function.  Ken and Corp Hosier went in this morning so I have missed them for today.  My mate is a boy named Smith, he comes from North Sydney and went to the same school as Ken.  The 3 of us spent our time in Durban together the first day, Smith having the bad luck to strike guard the 2nd day there so Ken and I were on our own.  I am sending you some  new  views from here, they are not very good but will give you an idea of the place.  I hope you get these things as I sent another lot from Durban.  There is a very small black population here compared with the other place but there seems to be a great number of Boers.  I will have to write more about this place later as I have seen very little yet but will post this now as I may not get another chance.  Give my best love to all including Miss Reid and much to yourself and Father. 
 I remain Your loving son Douglas. 
 Letter No. 4 
 Dear Mum, 
 Today we took on our gun at a certain naval base near Capetown, having left the latter place yesterday afternoon arriving here this morning and leaving again tomorrow morning I expect.  We are hoping to reach Capetown again before going for good.  We spent a splendid time there although we may have had a little more leave than we did.  One day we went for a route march about 10 miles, we went out to a place called Camp Bay, a seaside suburb where we had dinner and a good afternoon tea supplied to us.  The road of the march was cut in the side of a hill rising up from the sea and was a very pretty walk.  On getting back about 7.30 p.m. we were dismissed and had leave till 10 so I went and had a good tea and went to the pictures on my own as I missed all my mates in the crush getting off.  The next day we had leave from 1.30 p.m. so after having a good dinner 6 of us took the train for about 7 miles to a place with a big name and from there went to the Zoo, which is only a few lions and monkeys and birds and costs nothing to see.  From there we went to see Rhodes monument about 2 miles further on, all up hill;  from this place we had a splendid view of the surrounding country.  The monument of Rhodes is covered with a high raugh (?) supported by large pillars with a great number of large steps with carved lions on each side leading up to the pillars.  After
