Tuesday 26 Sept. 1916Still a continuation of the fine spell. Was to have gone to a lecture at St. Omen on "Gas" & made arrangements accordingly but then found that the lecture was cancelled. During the morning went to Hoppoutre & had a splendid bath, & in the afternoon was packing up for the move. Had early dinner at 6 o'c. & then walked over to the train at Brandhoek, going with the 2nd Bn. & M.G.s by it to Ypres, arriving at dark & thence having to walk out to Bedford House stopping at Lille Gate to have a cup of tea supplied by the Comforts Fund people. Arrived about 9 but did not get to bunk until after midnight, sleeping in the Gas Sergt's little dug-out.
