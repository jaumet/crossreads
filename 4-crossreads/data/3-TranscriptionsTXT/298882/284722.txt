 23rd  20th General Hosp. 
 The British attacked on a 40 mile front from St Quentin to the left of Bullecourt on the morning of the 19th and up till the 22nd had captured over 6000 prisoners.  The Cavalry, tanks and infantry have done wonderful work and the heavy guns have been pushed up with the infantry.  The attack was a complete surprise to the enemy who seem to have been thoroughly disorganised.
