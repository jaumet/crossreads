SEPT.   SATURDAY 9   1916
Fine, but cloudy. Went up to the dentist in morning but he told me to come back on Monday. Went out with the director afterwards. Lay round & wrote in afternoon & went up to the pictures with Warren Hogarth & Bill Hunter in evening.
 
Blessed is the man who has found his work - and then - gets busy!
