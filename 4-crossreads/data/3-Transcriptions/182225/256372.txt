<p>A cloudy cold day, but there was a little sunshine about 4 oclock. Poss Nivison &amp; I got a car &amp; went to Salisbury to get some petrol &amp; then on through Andover &amp; Basingstoke to Reading, to see Alan. It was a beautiful drive &amp; everything is beautiful &amp; green. We had dinner at the &quot;Ship&quot; Hotel in Reading &amp; then went to look for Alan but found he had gone on leave. We came back to Andover &amp; had dinner at the &quot;Star &amp; Garter Hotel&quot; &amp; got back here&nbsp;for tatoo. We had a great day although I would have liked to see Alan.</p>
