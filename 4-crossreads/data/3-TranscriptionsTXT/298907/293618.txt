helpless as a kid by now I almost felt ashamed of myself, by this time it was getting well into the morning so the nurse took my bandages off & waited for the Doctor to come round & see what was going to be done with me, at last down he comes & has a look at each patient, the old Dr. said I had as close & narrow a shave for my life as he had seen for some time & he asked me quite a number of questions as is usual in these sort of things, & marked me for the X Ray the following morning, then the nurse dressed my side after this it was much easier for a while but I could get no sleep, & the rest of the day passed slowly away & the night came on how it dragged & not a wink of sleep could I get the nurse gave me all sorts of stuff
