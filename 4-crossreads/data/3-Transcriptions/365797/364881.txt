<p>Dene Gully.<br/>Lindfield.<br/>15.3.15</p>
<p>My dear Alan<br/>Was so glad to get your letters &ndash; the telegram arrived too late for me to go in to see your boat go &amp; perhaps it was as well but we were so glad to get it &amp; also to get the Post Card. Everyone laughed over your enterprise in throwing your letter to a kind lady to post at Brisbane, &amp; also your way of letting us know your route.</p>
<p>But I must say it seemed dreadful to think what might have happened; but all's well that ends well &amp; I hope all the troubles will end so. Mind you take care of your health that is the chief thing.</p>
<p>We have not sent your letter to Unna yet but will do so. I see that she &amp; Dunlop came out first in a tournament up there &amp; Mrs. W. &amp; her partner second.</p>
<p>Dene has been to exam but is most fearful that his Latin was not good enough to get him through. Bruce came down a month before &amp;</p>
