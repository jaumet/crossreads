<p>15th November '16<br/>Early morning Stables after reveille 5 a.m.  Left camp at 7.30 for stunt.  Had a good ride out for about six miles from camp.  Horse holders let our horses go which resulted in a stampede.  My horse was badly hurt, and I left them in bivouac to bring her to camp.  The Vet. bandaged her up, but I am afraid she will be bad for some time.  Did not go out after I came home to camp.</p>
