I should like to be able to describe properly the beauty of these pyramids - they are broad broken mounds with gentle slopes & steep pinches almost cliff-like, all running to a central peak. Gradually they increase in height until with a sudden leap they tower up & topple over in a mass of green & white, & thunder down again - then where they were is only a great patch of churning foam. Then they rise again. They don't run any particular direction, but just slop about all ways.
At noon the sun came out blindingly & we were tossing in a sea of splendid colours - emerald green, purple, turquoise & opal shone in each summit while the hollows were darkest green flecked with yellow & white. I have never imagined any sea-scape so glorious ... and I'm glad I happened to get the chance on a boat built for rough weather voyaging.
12th We are just getting a move on once more. About 20 miles on the port bow we can see the mountains of Natal, & altho the sea is still tearing along we expect to get in sometime to-day. Had a fine time last night - men, hammocks, mess utensils, firebuckets & kits were flying in all directions. The sea finished its job on the deck aft
