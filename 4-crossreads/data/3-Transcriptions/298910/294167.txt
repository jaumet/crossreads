<p>I was back at the Base, as a Hospital case,<br/>an' was booked through to Blighty again.</p>
<p>We landed all right on a wet gloomy night<br/>But what did I care for the rain,<br/>When a Red Cross bloke fixed me up with a smoke,<br/>an' a crib on the Red Cross train.</p>
<p>So that's how I'm here feeling shaky an' queer<br/>In this clinking Red Cross bed,<br/>With a Red Cross Nurse, when I'm feeling worse<br/>To lay cool things on my head.<br/>An all of it seemed to be part of my dreams,<br/>Yet I know that it's not been a hoax.<br/>For there's thousands today who are ready to say<br/>Thank God for the Red Cross blokes.</p>
<p>Verse By L. Graham, H. Morton Smith</p>
<p>Gone &ndash; but he with us lives,<br/>Link'd in our strife,<br/>Link'd with the life that gives<br/>The Hero &ndash; life.</p>
