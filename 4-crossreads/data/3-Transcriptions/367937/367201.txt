<p>Bill Graham is over here now: came in the 16th Reinfs. but Jack Dawson also Bartrim has gone out to the desert on infantry work; was sent out while I was away.  I did not miss anything while I was away as the chaps spent the whole of the time in Isolation and we all came back here to "details" at the same time.<br/>We have all got horses allotted to us (will send you a photo of mine) and will get plenty of work; but it is not very hard.<br/>Revallie goes at 4 AM and from then till 8 o'clock we have mounted training and feeding &amp; watering horses, 10 to 12 we attend to horses &amp; then from  4.30 till dark we get more training &ndash; so you can see most of the work is in the cool.<br/>It is very hot in the middle of the day but the nights are generally pretty cold.<br/>We have to ride about a mile and a half to the canal to water the horses and they have to go three times a day so it takes a good time.<br/>On getting back to the camp from Ras-el-tin who should I meet straight off but Charlie Rayment and Ted Elliot from Nyngan and then to get back with all the other chaps was great luck I thought.<br/>I meet Jack Glennie also, of course he is in the regt. but has been in hospital and was then sent here; he took my horse to water for me one time, but we did not know each other then however in the<br/>over</p>
