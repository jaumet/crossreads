<p>22.10.15<br/>Fri 22nd</p>
<p>Last night our patrol under Sergeant Lowe went almost up to the Turkish trenches &amp; observed the enemy working on the parapet: he fired a flare from a revolver &amp; the machine gun section who was waiting immediately opened fire giving the Turks a little shock; It set in to rain nice &amp; steady about dinner time to-day &amp; has been coming down nice &amp; steady ever since. It is a brute in the trenches tonight but very warm and comfortable in this 'phone dug-out; Cakes can be bought on the beach for 2/- each but a man is very lucky to get one, as there are hundreds lined up awaiting their turn, they are sold by the Y.M.C.A. &amp; made at Imbros  by all accounts are not the best in the world; On duty from 2 AM till 6</p>
