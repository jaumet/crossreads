  
 3 - too badly to live - but on the whole against fearful odds our skilled surgeons & sisters have been able to bring the wounded into the happy state of convalescence. But the discomforts for the Pts in other ways, have been terrible to witness & still work cheerfully amongst them. Very bad food - bad cooking I hope only due to the want of the sergeant cook's equipment & not his methods - no clean clothes, no sheets pillows, mosquito nets, no beds - no spoons knives or forks or cups - but what the orderlies & surgeons gave from their own personal kits, a drop in an ocean for feeding 800. I cannot think how we have managed but here we are since the 9th August.
