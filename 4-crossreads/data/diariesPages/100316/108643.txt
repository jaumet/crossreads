5/5/18 Querrieu
At 9.50 moved the Battalion less 2 companies down to the Chateau grounds for church parade. It was a brigade parade and General Birdwood was delayed in turning up so the service went on without him. Later he arrived and presented medals to a number of men following with his usual speech so bluffy and characteristic. The Brigade then marched past to the time of the Bands. All officers then fell out and listened to a few remarks about reliefs etc. After lunch did writing, tried a couple of orderly Room cases and made a reconnaissance of a piece of ground for parade. After Mess Matthews gave a lecture on tanks and I followed. Then took 4 officers for a short talk on how to write orders. During the evening some of our chaps got at some wine and caused an amount of trouble. Strict guards were necessary. Sent out for DeBoos and had a talk to him. There was a heavy warm thunder shower early in the evening.
6/5/18 The battalion paraded out in a grassy field and was drawn up in mass for the first time for a couple of months. Devoted the morning almost entirely to specialist work and our Lewis guns were firing away at a terrific pace into the bank of a road. Grives had men firing the new long range rifle grenades and
