 than Stretcher Bearing. We are still unattached to the 8th who are miles away in a comfortable billet. Two of our Officers who have been with us from the start have been promoted to Lieut. Colonels &amp; moved to another Ambulance. This is very unfortunate, we have lost two very good men. A German Plane flew over today &amp; dropped a bomb into our camp. One Officer was killed &amp; to men wounded. Another narrow escape for the 8th. 
 Thursday 16th November 1916. A bitterly cold morning, the ice was about an inch thick in the shell holes &amp; frost covered the ground. I have never experienced weather like this before. Working all day unloading wounded from the cars, &amp; different odd jobs. We all miss our Unit &amp; wish we were with them once again. Another Taube flew over today, a bomb was dropped &amp; 6 horses were killed, about 300 yards from our tent. A great rush of patients, during the night, some of the poor chaps have been lying wounded in the open for over two days. A great number of men die from exposure, the Stretcher Bearers cannot get to them. 
 Friday 17th November 16. The weather this morning was even worse than that of yesterday. It was bitterly cold &amp; my feet were like blocks of ice. What a miserable climate this is, &amp; only the beginning of the winter too. A great rush of patients all day. All kept busy.
