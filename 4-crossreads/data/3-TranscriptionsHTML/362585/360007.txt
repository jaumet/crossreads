<p>[Transcriber's note:  This is page 5 of letter]<br/>Australians the more proud I am of them.  The other day I went into a ward where there were eighteen men, all with only one leg each &amp; one poor chap with two off.  What do you think they were doing.  The matron &amp; I could hear peals of laughter before we got to the doors she said they are up to some mischief while the sister is away.  Well &ndash; they were playing <u>football</u> without even sticks. they are simply wonderful the dear things.  We heard some very sad news about poor Harold Jaques this week</p>
