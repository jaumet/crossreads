  
 4.5.15 Tue. 4th.  Had another easy day.  A good many of the roads here are lined on either side with mulberry trees, & we had dinner under some of these to-day.  The Sqd. Sig. left the Regt. & we were signalling back to H.Q. from a mile away per Heliograph.  We were under the Mulberry trees, but put most of the time amongst the branches & I had the biggest feed of mulberry I have ever had before.  Returned to Camp early & Conway, Jeffries, & I had a good long run after tea & gave boxing a spell.  There is a rumor out tonight that we are to leave here as infantry.
