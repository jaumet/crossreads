Dear PeopleHow are you all getting on in Sydney. I hope everything is all right. Is Arthur still in work? I seem to have an idea something is wrong somewhere or somehow. Everything is all right with me, I have not got the fever yet don't think I will get it, although hundreds of the chaps are or have been down with it. I think I am in too healthy condition to get it. Physical Exercises night and morning, with a swim night morning, so I think I'll be pretty right. Well we are still in the same spot I don't think we will have much more to do now but Garrison work. Our only hope now is that a German Fleet will land a lot of her men
