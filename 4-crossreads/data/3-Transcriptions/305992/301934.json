So altered our course &amp; steered for same with the idea of ramming it when we steamed within 100 yards or so. The sea were mountains high. We found it was a dummy periscope on a floating mine set by the submarines. Another method of murdering by the huns. So put our helm hard over &amp; cleared same by a few yards. Had we touched we would all have no doubt perished for our boats could not be lowered in such a sea.<br/>The destroyer could not be seen anywhere so at 8am the Captain decided to go back &amp; see if we could find the destroyer for it might have met with an accident as the Med- is full of mines &amp; submarines. At 9am we saw the destroyer steaming for all she was worth &amp; appeared O.K. So signal &amp; turned around again &amp; proceeded towards Taranto. Everyone rejoicing to find our escort safe. Then the 0.8. signaled proceed 14 knots as we were steaming towards the entrance of the Gulf of Taranto &amp; wind &amp; sea decreasing to mod. breeze. The Destroyer signaled utmost speed &amp; sharp lookout for submarines</p>
