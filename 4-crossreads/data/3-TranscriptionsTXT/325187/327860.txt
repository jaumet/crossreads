 [Wednesday 26 April 1916] 
 Court again all day I'm doing all the writing &amp; have no time to write a word to you &amp; it is an awful scribble sometimes my fountain pen's good more often damnable. Word has come we have had a reverse on the Canal a matter of Outposts only, but its bad news- &amp; I would be with the Division now, if not on this Court martial, but this is good experience. I have written 148 pages of evidence so far. Very hot &amp; court crowded with unwashed Natives.  The INDIAN SIKHS are fine clean good looking Soldiers.
