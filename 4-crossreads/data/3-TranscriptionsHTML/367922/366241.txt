<p>Have been in camp seven months now passing through various stages of instructional work in the Wireless Training School.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Fry,<br/>I am enclosing the negatives &amp; 3 prints of Alan's Grave. I had them done by a Frenchman when we were in the village. The photos are not very clear but better ones could be obtained from the film.</p>
