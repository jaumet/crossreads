<p>of the line though not me would far sooner go up. We have had a very mild winter up to the present. Of coarse I am speaking of England don't know how things are in France dare say they are bad enough. Mud etc but not to be compared with last winter of coarse the winter isent over yet by a long way but each day brings us closer to the warm days so am very thankful for what we are getting. There were a couple of good falls of snow about Xmas time. But this month has been splendid plenty of sun. The ground is drying up fast.Well Father this is only a hurried note will write you a long letter later on. Trying to get all my letters answered. Love to all from<br/>your sincere son Clyde.</p>
