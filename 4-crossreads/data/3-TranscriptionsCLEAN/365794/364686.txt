  
 Wednesday 10 October 1917 Rose 6 a.m., bath, tea & motor trip to Mt. Lavinia 7.15 to 8.30 a.m., best of all our doings.  Long tree shaded street with every description of cottages & fine buildings on either side.  Many people hastening to the temple to lay an offering of a bright flower on the altar (?) before Buddah.  Mt. Lavinia large hotel facing ocean.  5000 Boer prisoners kept in enclosure nearby after Boer War.  Inspected lace making & bought hdkfs. 1/8.  Then went into Temple & listened to life of Buddaha  before  &  during , most interesting.  10 a.m. took rickshaw to town, shopped, then photos on way back.  Visited Christ Church - as usual - took group of native children just out of school, then lunch 1 p.m., paid 9/3 photos & films, boat again 3 p.m. & our glorious 24 hrs. over but never to be forgotten.  4 Jap war boats in harbour & one of ours which I snapped as she glided by.  We are once more at sea again & Colombo like a gem of the ocean fades away astern.
