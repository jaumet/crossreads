After this the field officers fell out for an introduction and General Birdwood asked me to allow the men to march off which I did. Had a long talk about general matters to Generals Monash and Birdwood and then took leave of Hughes and Cook who sailed away in their cars. Now returned home along very dirty roads and met Dick Dowden. After mess went down to the General &amp; tapped him for leave. He poured out his many troubles into a sympathetic ear.
