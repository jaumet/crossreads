OCTOBER   TUESDAY 17   1916
Raining all day. Went out with the battery on the staff as a horse holder. We were inspected by the C.O. & then took up a position & I believe they did not do to well. We got back late & we were cleaning harness all the afternoon. I went to the pictures with Jack Hunter at night. Got a letter from Linda & two papers.
