<p>Wednesday 5th. Sept.<br/>   Route march 2 &frac12; miles to the canal for a swim, most enjoyable.  Lecture in afternoon on Gas etc.<br/>Thursday 6th Sept<br/>  Route march in morning, afternoon off to "Arques" to do several things.  Two I failed to carry out. One to see Colonel Murphy of 18th because he was away for the day, second to see Tommy Gis, he also was away.  I saw a wonderful system of locks in the canal there.  The canal level drops some 70 ft or more necessitating 5 continuous locks, there is also a lift or rather two lifts which raise one boat up to the higher level at the same time <strike>lowing</strike> lowering one.  'Tis worked by the hydraulic power &amp; consists of a long basin into which the barge is steered the ends being then closed.  A lever is then pressed &amp; the whole affair basin, water &amp; barge is raised or lowered as the case may be, the end is then raised &amp; the barge passes out into the stream the process being repeated like a see saw</p>
