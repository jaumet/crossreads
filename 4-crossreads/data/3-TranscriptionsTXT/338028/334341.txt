 Sat 28th July 
 Awoke at dawn and commenced work, had 100 and 1 jobs to-do, the 9th L.H. left a lot of beds behind and I went around the heavy[?] sands pinching them for my hospital, after breakfast I was in charge of two fatigue parties erecting marquees, one for dispensary, other for hospital, finally erected, moved in and unpacked. 
 At three o'clock I was ready to receive patients, did a sick parade and sat down, then the Doc came in and congratulated me, also the O.C. and informed me next day I had to go to Ishmallia for drugs and red cross stores, worked till 10 making out reports and requisitions. 
 Sunday 29th July 
 Last night a limber ran over a man and broke his foot. I set it and made a lovely job, I was very pleased with result, put him in waggon this morning and took him to railhead E. Anglia Hospital. Then after a wait of two hours boarded light rlwy and arrived at pontoon bridge hence on donkey to Serapeum Stn, had to wait two hrs for train, finally arrived at Islamallia, where after a clean up I started on my business, my first was to the Aust Red Cross Stores. They treated me splendidly, I explained how we were situated and they simply could not do enough for me. They showered me with gifts, I got two cases of stuff from razors to champagne, they even offered to supply the money to erect a wooden hospital for us. 
 A man that growls about being in Australia ought to be shot, so far successful.
