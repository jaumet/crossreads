<p>Major allows me to write in his office and to-day an American Lieutenant came in, so I took the opportunity to ask him if he could tell me how to find Col.C. and Major S. His reply was "I'm from Illinois - they ain't  fr'm Illinois - who the Hell are they?" He was about as crude as they make them, so I didn't persist.

The boys were in their blankets in the loft reading by candlelight. All of a sudden a quick ear caught and imitated the uneven drone of his engines, which don't synchronise. "The Hun!,<br/>the Hun!" he said sing-song fashion. All listened, and then, as the lights went out, joined the first in the chorus. They do this every time, and as he gets near they change it to, "for you! for you!" To-day it was said that several of last night's Hun bombers had been brought down. This afternoon I saw a great attempt to stop a Hun airman. A very close "archie" barrage was put up to prevent his escape, until the hanging puffs of shrapnel smoke lay along the sky like a</p>
