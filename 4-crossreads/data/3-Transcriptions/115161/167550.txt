<p>not worthy of mention, but as I wish this book to contain a certain number of chapters, I fear I must inflict on my readers a few more of the petty experiences of my camp life, before passing on to the more exciting and perhaps - more interesting phases of my military career.</p>
<p>For the last few Sunday mornings in camp, an improvemnt (I should perhaps have said, an alteration) was made in our breakfast menu. We were given sausages instead of the everlasting stew.

On one occasion I noticed a big fellow - he was a bit of a bully, and always tried to &quot;rule the roost&quot; - take his two and quickly cover them with mashed potato, then take two more sausages.

I think the chap did very well out of it, he collected about seven or eight halves, still we all thought he deserved them, as the suspense at first must have been rather awful, to miss such a welcome change of diet. I decided that if I was ever near that big chap at the front, I&#39;d keep a close watch on my rations.</p>

I remember once an A.P.M.&nbsp;in France telling me what a fine body of police he had, every man over six feet. Yes!

Take the office away and where would you be? And as it is right through life generally, the big man attracts only by means of his size, but the small man is invariably the man who &quot;gets there&quot; and makes a name for himself in</p>
