 side my skull the conclusion reached was &ndash; "The girls will do what is best and will act in a way more satisfactory than my advice would lead to". 
 Colonel Martin returned from Alexandria at 12-45 p.m. today, and relieved me from the duties of O.C. the Hospital, which have fallen to my lot since Tuesday.  It is probable that his following will be glad, because no one during my rule dare come into the office unless he had business, nor can he sit in it smoking and talking with his pall, nor was the same allowed in the outer office.  One officer said to me &ndash; "It is a pleasure to come here on business while you are here, one can do what is to be transacted in comfort without interruption by irresponsible individuals, when Col. Martin is here I hate to enter the office". &ndash; That explains my position.  If I go to the office, as likely as not all the officers &amp; clerks will be smoking pipes or cigarettes, a junior officer or a private may answer for Col. Martin or interrupt him.  What can one say while the Colonel himself is there?  These irresponsibles had a smokeless &amp; a quiet time while I was in charge.  My way may not be as popular, temporarily as is Col. Martins, but I believe that it is better &amp; productive of far less trouble in every way therefore shall I keep to it. 
 Goodbye!!!  Goodbye!!!  Goodbye!!!!!
