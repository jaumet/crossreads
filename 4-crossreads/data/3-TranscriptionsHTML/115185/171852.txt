<p>5 &ndash; our R.P.A.H. sister is night sister in charge so strange to find her there &ndash; also to feel that Culson has been here. The town &amp; trams swarms with Australian Soldiers &ndash; N.L.S. and British but mostly Australian. They behave dignifidly and well. &ndash; are most courteous to us when in trams with us &ndash; salute us. We are the pioneer hospital for the Dardanelles. It's a great honour, and all the English army sisters are fearfully jealous. But I think we stand the hard<br/>ships better and know how to make things do. Also we seem to have much better training in the importance of asepsis and the carrying out of it against all odds. They'd horrify you the way they touch discharging dressings with their hands &amp; then handle sterile wool etc.<br/>I expect you'll think I'm blowing our own trumpet but I wish you were here to hear what the English Surgeons say. Our Matron Miss Wilson from Brisbane Hospital is the most charming</p>
