<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Hope I don't burden you with my frequent and dull letters.  They are dull because there is nothing I can tell you of interest.  We don't do much really &amp; you wouldn't be in the least interested by a recital of the daily programme.</p>
<p>Same thing every day, now that I have sort of settled to things I can keep the work well down &amp; have I think too much spare time, so I am going to start swatting up gunnery again.  I have sort of dropped behind lately.</p>
<p>The weather is still most uncertain, quite warm &amp; close &amp; drowsy the last few days &amp; we had a tremendous storm on Friday evening, one of the real Riverina ones.  Most spectacular but I didn't enjoy it as I was 8 miles from here &amp; had a bike &amp; was rather worrying about getting back.  However it cleared up &amp; I managed all right.</p>
