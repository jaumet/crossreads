 (Rather a sore subject the Pipe LINE so will ring off-) Posted Notes yesterday-  Our Pipe line is struggling out but owing to an Austrian Firm having half the Contract the threads are different.   Some of the Regiment went for a bathe in the Mediteranean only 4 miles away but I have not been yet-  It is heavy sand to ride over & men & horse want sleep chiefly- Off again at 3 AM or 1500 as we call it on another 2 days STUNT to Johnny TURK the men always seem to know in the Lines long before even the Officers get orders; what is going to happen- Like in the Bush when the traveller can always tell you when each Station will commence Shearing & No. to be Shorn.
