 4 February 1915 Thursday Stables as usual My Reg moved out at nine for a Brigade Scheme, all the officers were present, but they know nothing about a form or register.  The N Z arty was out in action &amp; the L.H were with us they are a fine body of men both they and ours.  Gen Birdwood opened the YMCA today &amp; he spoke of our troops in action &amp; informed us that it wouldn't be long before we were there.  The Turks attempted to cross the ditch by a pontoon bridge they were allowed to half construct it when the arty opened fire, the turks were blown to smithereens &amp; 200 captured if the LH had been there they would have captured many more, our losses were two men injured. Teddy went over [indecipherable] Troop and they are any-how no instructors. Bed 9pm
