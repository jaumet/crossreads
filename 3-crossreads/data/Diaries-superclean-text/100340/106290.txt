France4/2/18Dear Sis Vol,Am just writing a short note to let you know I am still quite alright going on well. I have been waiting very patiently for a letter from you but it is a long time coming. The last news I had from you was the letter telling me about the strike so you see it is a few months since I heard any news of you. In fact I have had no letters at all since I have been back in France. The last Australian letter I had was from Laurel ten weeks ago dated beginning of October as she is in Queensland you can guess I got very little news about you or anyone at home. Anyway Sis I can only hope for the best sincerely hope that my little niece is growing a nice big strong healthy girl. I suppose she is quite old enough now to give a power of cheek to both her father mother.
