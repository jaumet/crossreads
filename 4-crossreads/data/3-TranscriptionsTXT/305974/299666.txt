 20 Monday The artillery about here keeps up a continual bombardment on Fritz's trenches although at some times it isn't so loud.  Fritz is putting rather large shells nearly all round our dressing station some bursting only a few yards away.  An Officer out of the Pioneer Btn was killed &amp; about 8 wounded by one shell, also 2 stretcher bearers out of the 13th Fld Amb were wounded.  Saw one of Fritz's ammunition dumps blown up, it was rather a pretty sight. 
 21 Tuesday It is misty this morning &amp; there are a good few patients to be carried down, our squad carried a wounded German down, he was a very young fellow.  With continual treading in the mud on the track it is getting much deeper &amp; worse, we go over our knees in it now, it is awful.  Fritz must have good observation because he puts a good few shells on this hill &amp; if he could only put them about 100yds to the right it would be finish us, he has the range of us nicely 
 22 Wednesday There was a very heavy mist this morning but it cleared away about 10 am. Fritz is still shelling this hill including shrapnel he shells the village of Flers very much.  There were great air activities about dinner time it was very exciting to watch the airoplanes diving &amp; firing at one another.  2 German airoplanes were brought down (smashed) one of ours was brought down by a German airoplane (both pilot &amp; observer were wounded) &amp; another had to land owing to engine defects.
