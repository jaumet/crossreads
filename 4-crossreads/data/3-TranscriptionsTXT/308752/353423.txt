I noticed the roads leading up to the town were crowded with transport, it did not take them long to get a move on. When once considers that it is scarcely two days since Fritz left this town it is smart work. One little point I noticed that there were very few graves about, I wonder what Fritz does with his dead. At 9 a.m. we proceeded to another Post situated in one of the main streets, our diggings are in a ruined house, all hands set to work & we soon made quite a comfortable home in the cellars. Secured beds, tables & chairs etc - some style. Came across a great crowd of the 8th Bearers, who left the Post Station the day after us, & came by motor lorries to this town. Our work here will be to form a Main Dressing Station, from here any casualties will be conveyed by car to the different clearing hospitals etc. Tom Ross has been sent to another Section, this will be the first time that we have not been bearingtogether bearing together. A couple of big shells landed in the town just a little warning from old Fritz, he is evidently a long way
