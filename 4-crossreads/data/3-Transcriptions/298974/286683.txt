<p>Dear Mother.</p>
<p>The trip so far has been lovely. Of course there are many sick, but for a wonder I have been down to every meal, and have done any ordinary self respecting horse justice in the amount eaten. The food is good. We have roasts vegetables, cold ham &amp; mutton with pickles, plenty of bread &amp; butter &amp; tea &amp; coffee. This morning we had the most lovely porridge, while yesterday we had barly broth. Revaille goes at 6 and it is quite dark when we get up on decks. However I have not yet seen the sunrise for there has always been a fog. Still, you can imagine what an interest I have in this rare phenomenon incited in me, in fact gentlemen, I might say instilled, imbued, inforced in me, drawn, extolled, exhorted from the very heart of nature herself, from my boyhood. Sed fleistra, flustia, vevi, non vedi.</p>
<p>We sleep in hammocks with two blankets, all packed like sardines. Alan will tell you all about it. Twelve of us sleep in a space 12x6 feet</p>
