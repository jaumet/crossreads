Friday 28 July 1916During the morning waiting for orders to move, but nothing doing until in afternoon when I went down to see about the loading of a motor lorry with packs of the men, afterwards coming on in charge of it : was thus saved a 9 mile march & was not sorry for it. We reached La Vicogne about midnight & had very rough & crowded billets.
