<p>As soon as we arrived we were sent to a good dug-out a hundred yards along a by road overlooking a large valley, &amp; it is there that I am writing this on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Just down in the valley we can see a battery of howitzers; on the opposite hill in patches of green other batteries of howitzers, &amp; at least one big gun; &amp; on<strike>e</strike> our left on another hill some 60 pounders. These are firing all day &amp; part of the night, &amp; I suspect there are many other heavy guns here that are lying doggo.</p>
<p>On the opposing hill there is a triangular wood, &amp; before the advance of yesterday, Fritz held that, so in those times this by road was under direct</p>
