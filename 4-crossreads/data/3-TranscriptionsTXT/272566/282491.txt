Morning walked round Pelsall with Uncle George Harrington.  Called on Mr. Tom Lloyds and at Harrington's Bakery.  Saw all the old houses where father was born and lived etc.  The cemetery, but didn't go inside.  Dinner Tea at Uncle Charlie Allsop's brought here by Madge.  Called at Auntie Lunt's in afternoon.  Bessie took me back to Harringtons.
