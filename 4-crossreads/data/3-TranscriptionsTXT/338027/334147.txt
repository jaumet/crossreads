 Thursday, 11 March, 1915 According to the letters we receive from home, our mothers are worrying over our behaviour.  It is all through the awful lying reports written by Capt Bean the correspondent.  There have been a few black sheep but the wonder is there have not been more, as Cairo offers more temptations than any country I know of.  I had a report published in P.U. sent to me and it is thought a lot of by my mates here.  All my letters bore good news, but things are very bad in Aust. 
 Pay day to-day and welcome it is as we were all broke.  I went to O'R's at night and had a nice evening. 
 Friday, 12 March, 1915 Exercised horses again had some more jumping down on the canal.  A. section went out with Bde, on a field day. 
 All our horses were clipped by the afternoon by niggers under contract.  They clipp well and quickly.  They have 3,000 horses to do in five days so they will be going home.  There is a big gang working and there is some rare fun with the bad horses. 
 It took three niggers and myself to do Sammy.  We had to switch him, twist his ears and finally attempted to throw him but no hope we got him finished with difficulty.
