The Bedouins are reaping their corn all along the flat country of the Jordan valley or plain and Boaz & Ruth are scattered all over the landscape also donkeys, arab horses, camels - pictures by the mile, but the everlasting sense of duty forbids & I stick to "military interest".
My fellows of the War Records Unit are quite jolly & my two troopers look after me well, so everything in the garden is lovely except flies, mosquitoes & sandflies.
We move on to Jisr Benat Yakub a crossing of the Jordan about 20 miles above the Sea of Gallilee day after tomorrow & then on to Damascus, Amman, Salt - and home!  Can't believe it but queer things happen & I may yet live to show you how to drive tacks into linoleum but it must be in my shack in the bush.
