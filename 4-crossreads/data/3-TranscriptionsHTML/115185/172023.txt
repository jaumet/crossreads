<p>7 &ndash; I am glad you did not let Arnotts use my name &ndash; also that my "words" can be of any use to them!!! It is very funny.<br/>Darling mum &ndash; don't you think you over estimate my scrawls &ndash; I never felt any of my letters <u>are</u> interesting &ndash; rather sordid &ndash; and I am often so stupidly tired I cant find the right word &ndash; or spell, well I suppose that doesn't matter much &ndash; for rested &ndash; I spell I know rather badly.<br/>Of course since I came to Cairo &ndash; I have been greedy for bread &amp; butter &ndash; and fortunately what we get in our mess is good. Madame Lewis our [indecipherable] is a french woman and must know a good baker. I feel as if I never want to eat a biscuit or tinned fish or fruit ever again. But who knows, in a few weeks it may be our fare again &ndash; and be glad to get it.<br/>I am glad you have the flat to yourselves again and that you will have some privacy for a bit.<br/>I do not say any thing about Edith because she has endured so much and been such a brick &ndash; that I cant judge for her. I want her to do anything she can to help yours &amp; Fathers &amp; Mrs Rich's wonderful effort to restore Bills manhood</p>
