good too. Arrived at Fremantle at 7.30 P.M. men went ashore this morning, then there was general leave from 2.P.M. Went to Perth where the city tendered us a welcome at the town hall gave us a "bun struggle"; the freedom of the City and generally did us grand. Genuine people here, for this is dear old "Aussie"; and everyone is satisfied with our royal welcome home.

Sailed from Fremantle at 7.30 A.M. the H.M.H.S. Kanowna sailed just after us. A bit of a head sea. Passed Leewin light at 7.P.M.

Experienced splendid weather all the way across the Australian Bight. Light winds, smooth sea. Have been going slowly, but we are making better speed now. Sighted land again this evening.
