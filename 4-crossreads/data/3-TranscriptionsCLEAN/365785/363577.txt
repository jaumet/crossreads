 Dear Mrs. Read Thank you very much indeed for your Xmas card in the shape of a boot which was sent on to me by Jack.  It was good of you to remember me.  I hope that you are all well and that you had a Merry Xmas and that this New Year will bring you every happiness & comfort. 
 Kind regards from E.C. Bartels
