<p>strange to say I felt as fit as a fiddle &amp; chaps who had so far not been sick were flat out to it now   down below there was a lovely scene practically all the crockery had been broken, it was impossible to keep anything still, even we ourselves find it hard to get about on account of the heavy rolling.</p>
