<p>"The Carthage"<br/>the neighbourhood of the French lines but we could not tell what it was. At 2 o'clock whilst sitting down to dinner we felt &amp; heard an explosion &amp; passed a joke concerning it, but on looking out of the Port Hole I saw four Destroyers steaming rapidly away from the Battleship &amp; on looking in this direction I was amazed to see a large French Transport * heeling over at the stern. She had been torpedoed &amp; was rapidly sinking. It was an extraordinary sight. The stern disappeared first, the bows pointing up into the air straight up &amp; then gradually disappeared leaving nothing but a swirl of water with debris &amp; a few bodies. Trawlers etc hurried to the rescue &amp; Destroyers began to circle round looking for the submarine. Our ship, an armed Patrol boat also took up the search &amp; our Gun &amp; crew sighted something near where the French Battleship had been &amp; instantly fired several rounds at it. I was standing close by &amp; the noise was deafening although only a 12 pounder. There was quite a panic on board, nearly everyone thinking we had been hit &amp; they rushed up on deck tying on lifebelts etc. One Ghurka died shortly after. I fancy the fright helped him along. We steamed over where she sank. A very serious moment</p>
