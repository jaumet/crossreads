  
 Saturday 12 January Pay day.  Nothing to report. An old fashioned picture show to-night at Y.M.C.A., pictures I saw ten years ago. "Padres" in the army in the field are a force and we have not seen one for over a year. 
 Sunday 13 January Beautiful fine day & a walk to Ballieul this afternoon. Nothing at all of interest. For about an hour I watched the 'planes landing, rising and stunting over the 'drome at Ballieul.  The more I see of the machines the more I marvel at them.
