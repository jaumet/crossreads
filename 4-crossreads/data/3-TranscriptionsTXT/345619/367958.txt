in Australia, "it is a bit awkward to write" in my excuse, I wonder if I told you I had a couple of nice letters from Miss Austin? Did not tell her I was wounded, as I thought it looked as though I wanted to advertise it, but she evidently saw the name in an Official list, she is making me a woollen "Sweater"     for use when I get about.
Well Mum I am quite stumped for news, except that I love you just as much as ever, and long for the time when I will be home again, and quite agree with you that we will continue to love each other as we promised to do down at Rooty Hill Church, that day long ago, when you walked in "Miss" and walked out "Mrs" Goodbye my dear old sweetheart with all my "husbandly" love for you only, and the rest for you & the nice little kiddies from [Indecipherable]XOXOXO
