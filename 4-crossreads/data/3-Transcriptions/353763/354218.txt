<p>Thursday Oct 1</p>
<p>Nothing doing  -  We went up alongside the Aorangi for water  -  Got none or very little I believe  -  This morning at 7 am we went out into the bay &amp; anchored Elms &amp; Blayney &ndash; two of our absent officers &ndash; rejoined us last eveg  - Elms had been in the Sumatra &ndash; a prize fitted with a gun in her bows &amp; used for patrol work  - Blayney had been skipper of another prize the Madang &amp; used to carry the military &amp; stores to Herbershohe  -  Elms has a keen sense of humor &amp; is a most enjoyable chap  -  He said he was glad to be back for he had been afraid they might be arrested for 'loitering'  -  He had also recommended that a gun should be put in the stern of the Sumatra &ndash; she must run he remarked &amp; we could poop the enemy &amp; the recoil wd  -  shoot us ahead an extra 5 knots for a bit  -  He can drink &amp; talk some  -  I can vouch for it  -  Captains Moore &amp; Stoker put off to a 'pow wow' on the flagship at 9.30  -  What transpired we haven't been told so here we are marking time  -  All leave stopped  -  Its Oct 1st  -  My ship's Company &amp; that of AE2 &amp; the Protector are all well  -  I returned my only anxious case (Murray) at 2.30 yesterday by the mail boat to Sydney  -  He wants a little retail attention by means of Radium or a surgical operation of a delicate nature &amp; I am sure no one here could do that so thoroughly as <strike>in</strike> a big Sydney hospital  -</p>
