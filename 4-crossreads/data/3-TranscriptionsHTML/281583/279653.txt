<p>26.9.16  Tuesday<br/>The fine weather still continues, although it is springing up windy. This means that we will have to watch the Gas, but on account of the wind being so high no attack is likely to come.</p>
<p>Big rumours are flying round of a Great British victory on the Somme front but nothing official has as yet come through. We did know however that the greatest bombardment of the war has been in progress for the last 72 hours. We can distinctly hear the rumble of the artillery here in Belgium &amp; we are about 80 to 90 miles north of the Somme. The English papers state that it can be heard over there. We are all anticipating the fall of Thiepval &amp; Combles &amp; I rather fancy that these 2 towns are the objective of the next big attack.</p>
<p>Last night I went to a Farm House &amp; made a study of their ways. All the farm hands roll into the one room for their tea &amp; I'll bet it doesn't take them 10 minutes to finish. The Boss cuts the bread &amp; by jingoe's you ought to see the knife he uses. Their meal consists of a kind of soup with brown bread. No such thing as tea, I fancy they are decidedly worse than our own country yokels in their ways.</p>
