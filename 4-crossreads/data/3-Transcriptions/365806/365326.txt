<p>14. Nov 1916<br/>In England<br/>To<br/>Mr. Justice Ferguson.</p>
<p>I am dropping you a few lines to let you know that I have just received yours Very Welcome letter dated Aug 7th.  The reason why it was delayed that I was wounded on the Somme Front on the 4th of August. although I am getting along alright now &amp; I hope to soon join up my Battalion again.  Well, Mr. Ferguson you asked me to tell you Something about your Son's career.  Well, the Boys of his company would follow him anywhere he went &amp; I can Say this about him that he was the gamest Officer in the 20th Battalion &amp; he deserves a Victoria Cross of the work he done on the night of May the 5th. at the time of the Bombardment at Bois Grenier where he could not get on his feet he crawled on his Stomach.  Well Sir I have Very Sorry to Say that there are very few of His 6Rt Boys alive now.  As they were absolutely Slaughtered on the Somme.  The Weather here is very wet &amp; windy I have not seen Mr. McCallam for some considerable time now So I could not Say how he is faring.  Well Sir I will now close hoping yourself &amp; Mrs. Ferguson &amp; Miss Ferguson is in the Best of Health as it leaves me at Present.</p>
<p>I am yours sincerely<br/>Pte. A. L. Little 6 Co.<br/>20th Batt. A.I.Forces</p>
