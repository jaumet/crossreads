a day's trip with these chaps  -  Not that there was very much chance of this being allowed but I wanted the experience & should have gone like a shot if I'd been allowed  -  Lucky I waited  -  Out here - you know - with all the crowd no one thinks of danger or of the future  -  We heard yesterday that we are supposed to have done very well to get here & that we ran a very big risk - hence the darking  -  Our men I told you made a torpedo tube & one & all meant to have launched or at any rate attempted to launch one - bang - at any ship that bailed us up  -  If we'd blown up the Protector by mistake I wonder what the Admiralty wd  -  have said!!!
Well, well  -  Moore I didn't see much of but poor Scarlett's end is tragic - that beautiful bright cynical boy & poor Besant, thoughtful with a sweet smile & a kind voice & a lovely manner  -  Then there's the men - the Stokers  -  Dare devils  -  You should see a submarine & yet for a few shillings - sometimes but one extra per week these chaps cheerfully & willingly risk their lives - day by day - week in & week out & think nothing of it
