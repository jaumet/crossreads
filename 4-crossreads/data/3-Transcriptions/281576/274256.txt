<p>Con. Camp</p>
<p>Sunday. Aug. 5th   Good Lord: reveille at 6 &ndash; Sunday morning too.  It's enough to drive a man to drink &ndash; Church Parade in Church Army Hut.  Nice cheerful service.  The music was supplied by a string orchestra of about 12 performers.  The chaplain didn't preach a sermon, but had a straight little talk with the Boys.  The Hall was packed &amp; as I looked around, it struck me what a cosmopolitan crowd we were. On either side of me was a Maori &amp; a Canadian.  Right in front sat a chap as black as the ace of spades, &amp; next to him sat a S. African.  The parade was in charge of a W.O. of the Westminster Dragoons.  It is pouring in rain again.</p>
<p>I put in for a pass to Rouen but it won't be much use unless the rain knocks off.  Fell in at Police Tent &amp; were issued with Belts &amp; passes.  Walked about &frac34; mile along the road to the Tram.  Electric Trams, but they travel very slowly.  Arrived Rouen after about &frac12; hours ride.  Fine, big city.  Full of Troops, all nationalities.  Shops &amp; cafes all in full swing.   Anybody can get a feed  &amp; a drink at any hour, excepting British troops.  These have to wait till 6 before they can obtain a refresher.  A machine gunner, Jack Benton, 14 B'ge, came in with me.  We visited the cathedral first.  It is a beautiful building &amp; very very old.  A service was being held, &amp; we were lucky in hearing the fine organ, &amp; the choir in some beautiful singing.  Next we visited the Market Square where Joan of Arc was burnt by English soldiers.</p>
