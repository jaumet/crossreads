<p>250<br/>Read "Esther Kahn" in Symon"s 'Spiritual Adventures".  A fine little 'Imaginary Portrait" and just how far true of many such cases.</p>
<p>251  Oct. 14<br/>This afternoon Jake and self out with Val and had most enjoyable afternoon for a long while, out to Wimille &ndash; half way along to next village &ndash; pulled up by Tommy A.S.C. motor, motored to back of Napoleon"s monument Boulogne, through valley, back through Wimille, tea at Wimereax and back to camp at 7.40 p.m.  She"s a jolly little girl, and we all enjoyed each other"s company.</p>
<p>252<br/>General congratulations of the six of us left from B.3 Mess.  Jack left last week for Blighty &ndash; staff job.</p>
<p>253  Oct. 15<br/>Jake leaves, 7th on the list for Blighty:  self about end of next month.  Cabled tonight to Pater for &pound;15.  Evidently letter of July asking for same to be cabled to Commonwealth Bank against leave didn"t arrive home.</p>
<p>254<br/>It"s a case of "if you know of a better 'ole go to it".  We"ve engaged a room at some hotel in Wimereax for sleeping in during the day:  it is a bit satorial but we"ll have no chance in the 43rd and 1 F.Amb. so we"re going to &ndash;</p>
<p>"Make the most of what we yet may spend<br/>Before we too into the dust descend."</p>
<p>255<br/>Tonight heard from Bill in No. 14 stationary.  He"s booked for Blighty next week, must try and see him before he goes.</p>
<p>256  Oct. 17<br/>I wish I could see the ending:  if tomorrow fine it will come quickly.  Last night she &ndash; for some coffee:  tonight for some quinine:  and both nights spent the time yarning with Jake and self.  Tonight"s subject &ndash; practicality in Death Bed Triologue.  If then on tomorrow we"re to meet her at the Y.M.C.A. and over Wimille way look for pancakes:  the "aged S. African" is to accompany us &ndash; for Jake.</p>
<p>Personally I can"t see why she should [indecipherable] on to me:  Jake said, and is this to satisfy her as she almost asks.  But then does she want to prostitute Browning to her own ends and excuse herself as temperamental lover?  Intellectually she"s well up, yet she is ready to declare the best poetry to suit her own ends.  But the question is, to what end is she playing?</p>
<p>257<br/>Turning in this morning we discussed her, and her aims:  and our conclusion simply predicted what happened tonight.  Then she shewed when I went down to the stacks with her that to a big extent she"d lost all sense of the fitness of things.  I"d prefer to be altogether out of it:  yet to back away now would be &ndash; to her - worse than going on.  Certainly she must have seen, and can now see that I don"t want to take advantage of her insane curiosity.</p>
<p>J-s anxious as to how I"ll tackle married life.  "How"ll you manage when you"ve <u>got</u> to stick to one."  God knows, I don"t.  But if she can play Chopin and keep sober things may turn out better than they usually are.  Where he can stick to one after a conversation, there I"d sicken of her and lose all desire to know her.  That"s what I"m sorry about with V.  It"s always been the way though, even towards books and pictures &ndash; certainly to a lesser extent, yet the feeling has in many cases been quite clearly defined.</p>
<p>258<br/>Coming down last night for our room, we ran into Col. Mack in the hall, and tonight Capt. Allen, once we meet Dick on the stairs it"ll be all up &ndash; then the best again.  'Maleish".</p>
<p>259  Oct. 18<br/>Three ways there seems as way out.  The direct way seems the letter, and I"ve written it.  Just exactly how she"ll take it, I can"t imagine, but its bound to hurt her.  The other two ways &ndash; one the</p>
