<p>1917 Sept<br/>about a week off we had a mighty parade, lamp reading. I got 99&percnt; in the weekly exam. Lieut Facey OC Signal School told me that if I came out on top in the exam he would send me to Dunstable, for an instructor's course. Tom McCann returned from the school he had been attending at Kandahar Barracks and was put in the same hut as Bill Collins and myself. Collins and I were caught lying in bed at 6.40 am one day this week. We had both been up and had pulled on our trousers, when Bill thought it a bit chilly so got back into bed. I followed his example but had only been there about five minutes when Scotty ( Corporal McPherson) caught us and carted us up to the sergeant Major. Luckily, Bill carrying a Lance Corporal's stripe, he let us off, rather than take Bill's stripe from him, for Willie came in handy for marching the signallers across to their class and he could hardly crime one and not the other.
