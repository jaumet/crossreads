<p>Friday 16 June 1916<br/>The night was quiet except that in the early part we sent out a patrol under Mr . Taylor (14/2nd) but unfortunately Fritz was expecting them &amp; very effectively bombed the party, 6 out of the 8 having more or less serious wounds, Mr. Taylor being amongst the injured. It was a most weird scene as, with occasional machine gun &amp; rifle-fire going on, the stretchers were placed on the truck &amp; sent back. Only at the last minute did Mr. Taylor take my place on the patrol. The day was fine with a fair drying NW wind blowing which dried the place up wonderfully. It was lovely to see the sun again. On the go during the day but nothing more strenuous than the exploration of some old trenches leading back to our reserve trenches. Very little "straffing" done, everything being extremely quiet.</p>
