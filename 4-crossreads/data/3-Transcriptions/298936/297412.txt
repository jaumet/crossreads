<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Monday 13</p>
<p>No sign of leaving so spent another day good in Alexandria.</p>
<p>Have sent several letters to Rita &amp; innumerable postcards embracing nearly everybody.</p>
<p>Discovered the Soldiers Rest which [fills in gap for there I can rest &amp; read &amp; write while Hunter goes on [indecipherable].</p>
<p>Heard some splendid music there.</p>
