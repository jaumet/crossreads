<p>supper, meat for lunch minus bread or tea. Have my food brought from Cairo by boys from convalescent camp.  Doctor would not let me out, saying I was under observation for a week or two.  Sisters do all they can for us, but the food &amp; bacon dripping is the same as ever.  The Sisters say they get the same as we &amp; have to purchase their own bread,  the issue is native brown bread with a good supply of sand in it.</p>
<p>10:  Things have gone on in the same old manner, during the past week &amp; today.  I had a relapse, the test proving positive M.T. malaria.  Back to bed, feeling very much off colour.  Temp. rose to 102.3 &amp; received an injection of quinine 15 gms, receiving three of these in 51st &amp; one at Ludd.</p>
<p>12:  Wholesale clearance of patients today, the lady quacks sending men out in spite of their condition.  Four sent back to bed by C.O. who examines all men prior to their discharge.  The doctors treat the poor Tommies in a shameful manner, but do not come with any of their Tommy jokes on our boys, who are continually asking to be discharged as the food is not fit for healthy men, let alone the sick.</p>
