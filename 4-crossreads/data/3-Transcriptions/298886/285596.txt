<p>Midnight 22 July<br/>Packing up ready to leave at 1 A.M. hell but I'm sleepy</p>
<p>1AM. 23.7.16. Moved out of Camp and marched away out into the vasty desert Daylight comes at last. and the order "Men may smoke!" is much appreciated it is the signal for the unloosing of tongues which have been tied up for so many hours If we could only be allowed to have a chat going along it would help to pass an otherwise dreary night and the men would not become so sleepy riding along. We are on this occasion the rear guard someone else is in front</p>
<p>6.30AM. Just watering our horses at the well at Qatia and had to "Scatter" &ndash; Enemy 'plane came over a few minutes afterwards our large Battle 'plane (the De Haviland) hove in sight sending his GNOME Engine at it's top speed (95 miles per hour.) after the TAUBE. The TAUBE by the way is a much prettier machine to look at. She resembles a huge, white, transparent, butterfly The TAUBE made off at <u>her</u> top speed, (estimated at 115 miles per hour) shots were exchanged at long range</p>
<p>The Taube disappeared in the distant</p>
