<p>6d per lb,  bananas were sold to night through the canteen at 4d per dozen,<br/>I speculated 1/6 on them &amp; had a very enjoyable feed.</p>
<p>Thurs 19th<br/>Had a good night's rest last night, &amp; there was no rain for a wonder, rose at 5 AM. &amp; had a cup of tea; by the way, when we buy tea it is from the Saloon galley &amp; very good, quite a change from the rubbish we get, we pay 6d for a cup of tea &amp; a scone &amp; it is worth it;</p>
<p>yesterday we sighted land which I believe is a small island at the south of India, but we were not close to it.  Thomlinson &amp; Pope have been transferred to the signallers, in place of Fitzgerald &amp; Oakes.  Nobody seems very distressed through Oakes leaving us.  The Minitor</p>
