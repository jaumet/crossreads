<p>At Beutin<br/>I must report on this village. Beutin Pas De Calais, to use the full title, is a small village 6 kilos East of Etaples. The village public buildings are four Estaminets, one church, and the Railway Station. There is a school, a bureax de postes, and the Gendarme National's residence. There is no other place of mention save the farmhouses which are typical to the other farms.<br/>Usual routine, and game of billiards. Today I won for a change.</p>
