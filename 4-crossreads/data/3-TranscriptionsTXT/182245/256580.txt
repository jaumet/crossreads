 MARCH 1917 
 6 TUESDAY 
 Fine but cold wind blowing 
 all day. I went up for a bath 
 in the morning &amp; it was great. 
 Out exercising horses in 
 afternoon. Jack Hunter went 
 up to the battery in evening. 
 I sent out an inkstand to 
 Jo, the model of a french steel 
 helmet. Received a parcel 
 of socks from Linda &amp; a 
 face washer from the [insec?] 
 &amp; a letter from Mother.
