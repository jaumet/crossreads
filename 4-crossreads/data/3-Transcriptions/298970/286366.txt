<p>before breakfast.  My clothes were splashed with blood.  The poor fellow died later I understand.  A sergeant was also shot in the head but not seriously.  There were 6 cases altogether.  During last night the boom from our Naval Guns in the rear shook the earth.  One of Fritz's big guns was hit yesterday.  My mate &amp; I are now at Elbow Farm in a solid little dug-out.  We have had rather a happy evening in company with two signallers and an A.M.C. detail man from the machine gun section.</p>
<p>1st August (Tuesday)</p>
<p>The cook from the Machine Gun Section brought us our breakfast in bed &ndash; cocoa and ham.  Trip in to Fleurbaix with patient.  Shells coming over this way pretty heavily today.  Top blown off the Church.  Back to Wye Farm Post,</p>
