<p>11/4/16  Tuesday</p>
<p>Very hot &amp; sand storm still going strong and I prefer not to express myself about the flies. Took the Boys out of the way on a route March thro <u>Matarich</u> as some new arrivals had never seen the sights &ndash; Met in the Church Sister's Eldridge &amp; Allworth who were on the Wondilla &ndash; had a good old chat with them &amp; they took some snaps of us.</p>
<p>Got a General fall in at 8 pm &amp; were told we would probably move off at some time tomorrow for an unknown destination. Most of the Boys are stoney broke &amp; we have been disappointed</p>
