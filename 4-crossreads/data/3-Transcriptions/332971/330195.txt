<p>to the right- this makes us wonder if anything fresh has arisen- if Greece has joined in and they are going to Salonika- we get very anxious for news.  (You lucky beggars to be able to digest the world's news for breakfast every morning).  The Island from here looks perfectly barren- not a sign of vegetation to be seen. Only nests &amp; rows of tents to the North- East &amp; West &amp; some windmills in the distance on the hills.<br/>14th  This morning at 8 am a steam-boat came alongside c the oldies &amp; we immediately started for the inner Harbour- here everyone brought their cameras to light &amp; many snaps were taken of the interesting boats &amp; scenes as we passed in.  On anchoring Colonel Fiaschi was soon alongside in our little RX hospital boat to meet C. Fetherston &amp; myself.  The fine old man he was pleased to hear the latest news of his wife &amp; delighted with the snaps I had taken of her &amp; his baby girl.  Now that I have actually re-joined the Unit any regret that had been lingering inside re <strike>on</strike> staying behind has quite vanished.<br/>The hospital is situated on a rise of land resembling a peninsula c water on 3 sides of it.  The Sisters tents extend to the banks of the waters edge.  The view on either side is beautiful</p>
