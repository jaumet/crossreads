1916   WEDNESDAY 23   AUGUST
Fine & warm. But it came on to rain a bit in the evening. Out signalling all morning & we were paid 30/- in afternoon. There was a lamp parade at night, but I did not know of it so missed it. I got a parcel (button & Kangaroo) from Linda & a couple of papers. Also a bulletin from Father. Warren came over & he & Jack & Self went to the Vaudeville show in the evening.
