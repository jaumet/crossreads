We had a cricket match & I was umpire in the aft - Supper 7 - Tinned brawn only & cucumber - I took a small bit & asked for vinegar - for my cucumber - We'll see if there is any Sir!! Where's the bread? We'll see if there is any thingSir - Well what else is there to eat - Nothing Sir My language was quite polite but very forceful - I stuck to my guns amidst a lot of talk & I trust some good will result - I've been asked if I will be mess caterer & provided I have the necessary executive power I'm quite willing I said but for all that - with no decent provisioning of the Fantome - No provisions to be got at Rabaul & no fresh meat or cold storage I mightnt do much - You've got here to start right & then you can carry on - We cd easily have lost two lives out of the five & better catering wd have stopped all that - Now I'll stop - I am going to write an article for the AMG on the subject - at least I think I will -Weather is - Wet season - hot steamy - thunder rain
