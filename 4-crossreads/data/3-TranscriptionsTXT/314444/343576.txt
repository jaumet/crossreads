[Jan 22 Rec'd]Mr. HarrisDear Sir,
Just a few lines in answer to your welcome letter of Sept 7th just to hand also a parcel containing 26 pks of Three Castles Cigarettes, and papers galore I say Sgt. dont you think its nice to have a fairy Godmother, like Mrs Avery & Miss Judd at home, Its awfully kind of Both of them, I had a letter from each of them this mail, they said they were sending a parcel for Xmas. So the receipt enclosed in your letter must be another parcel altogether
The two men Geo Maitland & John Hobart havent arrived at this unit yet, and Nye & Rodgers I dont think they will get to the 1st again, We are having a very rough time now, It rains every day and its very cold, with mud knee deep everywhere, Cant keep the feet warm at any price, I will look
