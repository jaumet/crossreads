 October 27th Walk this mng did not go - Concert held tonight, when a sketch entitled motoring was produced with success. It was really an excellent programme & the concert committe took this opportunity of inviting the German staff, so as to get the Commdt interested in our concerts. He enjoyed himself & I think appreciated our efforts - our Freigburger orchestra rendered some very popular air all of which met with the great approval of the House. Commr Lewis on behalf of the Eng officers said goodbye to the French officers who are leaving in the morning - 
 October 28th (Sunday) Frenchmen left at 3 am this mng they are being drafted to some reprisal camp on the Russian frontier - 
 No service this mng, on account of the minister being indisposed - 
 I had great hopes of making up a select party of 8 & transferring to a room vacated by the French - the camp officer consented but the Commdt refused to let us change
