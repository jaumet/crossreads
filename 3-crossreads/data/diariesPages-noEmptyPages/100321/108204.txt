24/2/19 Marcinelle
Breakfast at Bde.H.Q and put in all the morning going round billets and talking to different ones. Influenza is again becoming prevalent and an order now directs the closing of cinemas and public places of amusement. In the afternoon took a cruise round the crowded streets of Charleroi and penetrated as far as Haute Ville where there are many buildings which were destroyed in the fighting of 1914 between the Germans and French here. In the evening accompanied Harold Smith round to his billet where we were entertained by the Town Clerk of Marcinelle. A nice house. He has many decorations including L?Ordre de Leopold. Fine charming hospitable people who produced wine cognac
