7 - one of Auntie Mufflers and some sweets. He is a fine looking man - has done very good work. Jeffs a sick bay steward from the Grantala brought him along to see me.McGee Lieut Harrison's servant who was so faithful to his master till death took him - had a cross made by our Carpenter and he & J - that is McGee walked over to Portianis on Jan 2 and put it up. I took some photographs of it & McGee took one with me. I thought the mother might like to see her son has not been forgotten. Me two R.C. padres were there and they anointed it with holy water and said a prayer. While we were digging the hole for the base of the cross, two funerals came along & McGee and I had to stand to attention till they were over. It is an interesting scene - under the bare hills, beside the little greek church. The small English grave yard beside Mr Harrison lie the two Canadian Sisters. Then Mr McGowan of Col Bob's batt also Mr Harrison was 3 Batt. then poor wee Scott-Smith - Royal Engineers aged 19.
