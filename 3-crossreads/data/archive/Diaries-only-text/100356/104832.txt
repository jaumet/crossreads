Left Assuit - Arrived Sohag
Up again at 5.30 for the boys start on their trek at 8 this morning, we loaded the train by 10.30 then had to mess around until 3.30 when the train was due to leave, but when the train arrived half of our waggons were still on the platform so we caught the ordinary after a very dusty trip finally arrived in Sohag at 6.10, went up the town for tea then settled down to await the arrival of the troop-train, it put in an appearance at 1.30 meanwhile we were well nigh frozen, got our blankets went straight to sleep thoroughly tired out.
