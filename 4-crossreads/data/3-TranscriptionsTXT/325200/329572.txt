12th July '16Aeroplane scare yesterday morning again. The machine came right over the camp  &  we had two shots at it with a 3" gun which is mounted close to the camp here, the second was a good shot  &  must have been unpleasantly near him; he cleared off anyhow. It is very curious how one instinctively ducks now when hearing a gun. I, for one, simply can't restrain myself from so doing even though I know it is our own gun. It is instinctive & natural & everyone does it, in fact some people do the most
