Oct. 13
I heard it all, I heard the wholeHarmonious hymn of being rollUp through the chapel of my soulAnd at the Altar die,And in the awful quiet thenMyself I heard, Amen, Amen,Amen I heard me cry!I heard it all and then althoughI caught my flying senses, OhA dizzy man was I!I stood and stared:  the sky was litThe sky was stars all over it.I stood I knew not why,Without a wish, without a will,I stood upon that silent hillAnd stared into the sky untilMy eyes were blind with stars and stillI stared into the sky.
"The Bells of Heaven"
'Twould ring the bells of HeavenThe wildest peal for years,If Parson lost his sensesAnd people came to theirs,And he and they togetherKnelt down with angry prayersFor tarred and shaggy tigersAnd dancing dogs and bears,And wretched, blind pit ponies,And little hunted hares.
Fragments.Reason has moons, but moons not hersLie mirror'd on her sea,Confounding her astronomersBut O! delighting me.
God loves an idle rainbow,No less than labouring seas.
Babylon - where I go dreamingWhen I weary of Today,Weary of a world grown grey.
Still a few more to read, then I'll use the book as a Christmas card to Mat.
51.In the afternoon leave to Poys. with Frank.  An enjoyable afternoon and the town a pretty little place shining in one or two ugly spaces between quaint houses where bombs or shells have exploded.  By the large church more bombs seem to have been dropped than in the other part of the town, and all its windows shew fragments of missing lights.
For supper a little of Malaga, some coffee and shortbread, and back to hut billet.
No mail today.
