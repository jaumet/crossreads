Sunday 31 MarchStill particularly quiet on the front, but it is said that there is a raid coming off to-night.  There is a German Labour Battn. holding the line opposite us. This month has been a month of wonders, & the Ludendorff Offensive which now is twenty five miles deep from La Fere to Montdider, & now the Germans are ten miles from Amiens & can shell the Amiens-Paris railway. Prisoners are 70000 & Guns 1100, according to Berlin & in my opinion & in spite of expressions to the contrary, the British High Command was caught napping. Then the new era in guns, the shelling of Paris from 75 miles distance, is a wonder to be wondered at.
