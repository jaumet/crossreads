<p>Not much can be heard from inside the dugout. This place is a little to the left of the one which we were in about 10 days ago. We have a little more room, &amp; wire bunks to sleep in.<br/>Needle Trench Mar 8th 17<br/>We are having a very easy time. It is very cold outside icy winds, though we are warm enough here in the dugout. There have been very few shells or gun fire this time in.<br/>Needle Trench Mar 9th 17<br/>Lovely weather, a little snow. Yesterday afternoon about 4.30 Fritz put some shells over just behind our dugout &amp; some further back, one landed right on the duck boards, broke a double duck board to pieces. A few more have just come over. There are three of us doing shifts on the phone four on eight off I am on this morning from 6 till 10 am. We draw our rations at night, while in the trenches we have plenty. We had a few casualties yesterday, he caught a few with the shells that he sent over in the afternoon, other wise things are quiet enough. Do not know how long we shall be in this time, the general oppinion is that we have turns in support &amp; front line untill further orders.<br/>Needle Trench Mar 10th 17<br/>The night passed quietly enough. Yesterday I got a lot of back letters sixteen in all, some from home, Louie Tom &amp; England. Our rations which came along</p>
