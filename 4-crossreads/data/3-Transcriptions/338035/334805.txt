<p>Sunday 6th<br/>Church Parade morning in Military Cinema.<br/>Later.  Having received a note from Harry Martin at Parkhouse I decided to pay him a visit today.  Received a pass being lucky to draw one by ballot and at 11 a.m. set out to walk it.<br/>Came to Bulford Village in time thence on to Bulford Camp and on to top of hills.  Going over the hills I could not see Parkhouse and enquired of some people the way.  They were from London on holiday (Bank Holiday) and they offered me a drink and cake.  Received with thanks.  Arrived Parkhouse at 2.30 and was surprised to not only see Harry but also Billy McLean of Field Hosp.  Altho' busy they found time to chat and Harry told some of his Gallipoli experiences.</p>
