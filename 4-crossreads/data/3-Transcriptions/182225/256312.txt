<p>Fine in morning but raining in afternoon. On guard all day. Got off about 4.30 pm. We had an inspection of huts &amp; were issued with <sup>ticks</sup>&nbsp;<s>mattresses</s>â€‹&nbsp;&amp; pillowslips, also sleeping boards. They made some unholy regulations about keeping our clothes in certain places also. Sent a cable home. Came off guard &amp; then stayed about the camp.</p>
