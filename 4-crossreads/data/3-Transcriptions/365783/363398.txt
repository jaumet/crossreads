<p>I do not expect I shall be drawing any more but in case I do want to I have another blank Sydney chq. &amp; this will do.

You would be horrified to see the way the natives do the laundry work &ndash; prior to ironing they fill their mouth with water which they eject in the form of a spray over the article.   They manipulate the iron with their feet.  The natives that do my washing also darn the socks &amp; they do them very decently but not so well as your own dear self.<br/>I must now end up as it is on mail closing time &ndash; with best love to all the dear ones and bestest to my own dear woman<br/>Your loving husband<br/>Will</p>
