The weather still remains fine & everything is nice & dry underfoot. Misfortune has at last overtake me in that I have become "chatty" [(Lice)] However I am working hard to rid myself of them & hope to succeed ere long. I have been very lucky to escape them for so long but this fact does not make them any the easier to bear.

I went for a stroll last night & ended up at a big farm house near Boshepe, The people were very hospitable & insisted on us calling on them again.

I have caught a cold in the throat the first in many a long day, but hope to shake it off in due course.

There is a nice breeze blowing today & & from where I am sitting I can see the huge arms of the Wind mills all moving round & round & grinding the wheat whilst doing so .

The front is gradually becoming more active the artillery fire is daily growing in intensity. The results of the late Zepplin raid over England is very gratifying & the news of the destruction of 2 Zepplins caused much satisfaction among the soldiers. Unfortunately there was more severe loss of life than formerly, but a lesson of this kind will take the daring out of others.
