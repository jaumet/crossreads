  
 With reference to the foregoing: the following extracts are published for the information of all:- King's Regulations, para 1648 (extract) 'An instance should not occur of troops leaving a ship without all proper charges for losses etc. having been adjusted'. 
 Instructions for O/C Troops on Transports (extract):- 'All deficiencies of shipowners stores must be adjusted between O/C Troops and the Master of the vessel before disembarkation (vide Articles 100 "Instructions for the Masters of Transports") as the Government "does not accept any responsibility." 
 August 20th:- The claim was made for 1/- today. We were asked to sign for  1 and receive 19/-. I objected to accept my pay, and was placed under open arrest for disobeying an order of the O/C Troops. It was represented to me that this was a serious breach of Kings Regulations, that the penalty of my action was death*. I and two others+ refused on the ground that there was no liability; - that the stoppage of pay was illegal; no liability because I had not lost my articles issued; illegal for the reason that I did not sign for any of the articles, and also because I was being compelled to agree to a false entry in my pay book. I protested against the charge and appealed under para 1649, Kings Regulations. I accepted the 19/- under protest, and was released from arrest.
