<p>come up &amp; were closing in so as to cut off our retreat.  So the 2nd Brigade can think itself lucky to be still <strike>able to</strike> an active unit in the British army.</p>
<p>The retirement was a big thing &amp; the whole army retreated in a heap as it were.  Had to go a long way round &amp; rode all night reaching Belah at about 10 next morning, muddy, dusty, bloody, tired, sleepy &amp; hungry.  Perhaps if daylight had lasted another 2 or 3 hours Gaza would have been ours.  However we are nearly ready for another go for it &amp; this time I think we'll take it.<br/>It is a week since we attacked the last time &amp; a rough week mostly, as we have had to watch the movements of the enemy etc, while our army was resting &amp; getting ready for another fly.</p>
<p>Will write &amp; perhaps be able to give you details of a decided victory next time.</p>
<p>Lots of love to all<br/>From fond son<br/>Jack</p>
<p>Wrote a short note to catch an early mail this morning.</p>
