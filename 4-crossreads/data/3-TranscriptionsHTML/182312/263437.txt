<p>heavy and unbroken fire from artillery and mine-throwers that it is</p>
<p>not safe, and often it is impossible, to go out even at night to</p>
<p>bring food and water.&nbsp; It is impossible to depend on telegraphic</p>
<p>communication with the rear being maintained, so often are the wires</p>
<p>cut and so dangerous and futile is it to repair them.&nbsp; It is this,</p>
<p>that has led to a revival of carrier pigeon communication, not for</p>
<p>long distances, but as the only dependable medium of communication</p>
<p>from the front to the rear, a matter of a mile or so.&nbsp; As a means of</p>
<p>communicating with our artillery we found them most useful and much</p>
<p>more reliable than the rocket method of summoning artillery support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the stretcher bearers, and the Red Cross workers in</p>
<p>the advanced posts, every one has nothing but admiration.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>stretcher bearers go about their work with an utter disregard for</p>
<p>danger:&nbsp; they have their job to do and if they are killed, well, it</p>
<p>can&#39;t be helped.&nbsp; Their own personal safety is the last thing they</p>
<p>think of, all their thoughts being centred on getting their man back</p>
<p>out of the danger zone and to the dressing station.&nbsp; Providence</p>
<p>seems to watch over them.&nbsp; Time and again I have seen a stretcher</p>
<p>party coming down a sap or down through the gully leading back to the</p>
<p>dressing station when a shell or two would burst what appeared to be</p>
<p>right amongst them.&nbsp; You would wait for the smoke to clear xxxxx</p>
<p>xx expecting nothing but a bloody mass of human remains to be</p>
<p>revealed, when out of the smoke would emerge the stretcher party</p>
<p>quite unconcerned - they were&#39;nt hit so they don&#39;t even trouble to</p>
<p>look round and see what the shell did.&nbsp; Such luck, however, cannot</p>
<p>always stand by them and on one occasion I remember seeing by the</p>
<p>roadside the remains of what had been a stretcher party - three bearers</p>
<p>a patient and a stretcher, the last sacrifice of the stretcher bearers</p>
<p>and they make many.</p>
