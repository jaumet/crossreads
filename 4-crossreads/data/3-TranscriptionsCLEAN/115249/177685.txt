The wireless station having been captured, our objective in that direction has been attained. Recommend Beresford reinforce troops now at wireless and hold the station. Have instructed Colonel Watson to send two Companies Infantry at once to Beresford's assistance. Suggest also that garrison be left at Herbertshohe with one month's supplies, which have now been partially landed, and that balance of force move direct as early as possible on Rabaul. If approved, please instruct Beresford accordingly; I will advise Watson.
