My Dear Ones,
   Probably this is the last long letter that I will write from the above address, for we've packed again and hope to leave within the next few days, in fact on Wednesday next we expect to be off.  Since my return from London I've had a busy time, a day and a half at a "Gas School" where I passed (in my Helmet) ten minutes in poison gas ten times stronger than that which we will go through at the Front, the experience was one to give a fellow confidence in his helmet, for no ill-effects were noticeable; then in special goggles into tear gas which could be breathed with safety and smells extremely pleasant.  With the goggles on no effects were noticeable, but sixty seconds after removing the goggles, with streaming eyes and for the time quite blinded I was feeling my way to the door.  Both these experiments give one confidence in the efficiency of our helmets and goggles.
  The following day I took a small party of Infantry on a six mile march out to the Bustard Trenches where the Engineers were engaged in consolidating a crater about thirty feet wide and twenty feet deep caused by exploding a mine of 5,000 blocks of guncotton.  When theEngineers had taken over my men, Lieut Teague of the Melbourne Engineering firm, Purchas & Teague, showed me the whole work and explained it; it was a fine lesson and I then passed it on
