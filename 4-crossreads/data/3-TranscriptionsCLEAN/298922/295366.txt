I am told this place is the RHINOCOLURA where TITUS the Roman Emperor halted with his Troops en route to Jerusalem. The Wady which after rain becomes a bit of a stream is supposed to be the River of Egypt mentioned in Gen. 15 18 ? as forming the Western boundary of Abrahams possession. We are 50 miles from GAZA of the Philistines. Rafa is spelt Rhaphia in the Scripture.
