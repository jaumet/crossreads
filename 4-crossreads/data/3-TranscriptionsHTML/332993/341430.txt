<p>Our Quarter Master has been made a Captain &amp; wore his 3 stars today.<br/>I was out for a walk this afternoon with C. Handcock. We met several men of the 45 Battalion 4th Division who are now in this front ready to go in. I anticipate there will be very big things doing shortly on this front.<br/>Our M.O. Captain Yule is in Paris on line. There was a Major filling his place in the trenches. He went to bed about 10 and was called at 12, to attend to a patient. He could not be roused and died soon after. It is believed he was gassed by fumes from a leaky gas cylinder. It was a regrettable [indecipherable] affair.<br/>Monday May 21 1917.<br/>It is clammy hot and very close today. In fact it is oppressive.<br/>I saw a wedding party today. A New Zealand soldier was married to a French girl. There was some "swank" about it. A fine carriage. There had their wedding breakfast at an estaminet where I understand the girl resides.<br/>I received a letter from my wife written at Shepparton and dated March 27. I sent her an Anzac Bulletin of May 9, also one to Lizzie Gilmore. I also wrote a letter to her.<br/>This afternoon I got another letter from my wife No 58. Dated April 1. Written at Shepparton.<br/> I was only 51 days on the way.</p>
