<p>SUNDAY, JUNE 29, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny. Peter &amp; I drove down</p>
<p>to the rocks after foxes but got none</p>
<p>Had the ferrets round the burrows</p>
<p>in Mountain &amp; Middle but only</p>
<p>got a few bunnies.</p>
<p>Jo went over to a fox drive</p>
<p>at Beauly they got 3 over there</p>
<p>&amp; saw a good few more.</p>
