2 hours 5min my shorthand lessons and I have been getting along famous  Large mail again today and still no luck for yours truly  I sincerely hope that the people concerned may read this and feel ashamed of themselves. Washed some clothes  I hate that operation always did but cannot help it.7.30 pm.  Same date. Some one in the outpost line has just let a round go out of his rifle probably through fingering with the mechanism in the dark to see ( or rather feel ) how it was working. Result a strict enquiry tomorrow and someone will have to toe the line. That sort of thing usually happens where so much ball ammunition is carried. One day some months ago two of them let off their rifles within 5 minutes of each other it happened under the palm trees near Katia. One of them got a bullet through the foot.(his own foot fortunately ) I say fortunately, advisedly  because through foolishly handling a loaded rifle I would sooner see him put a bullet through his foot than mine. Anyway it was just before the battle of Romani and so he will not have much trouble making that bullet wound fit the Romani fight nicely.
