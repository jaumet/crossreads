up at the camp we have just left Fritz used to live and he had made the Position very strong. There was a small village there I believe, only a few heaps of broken bricks and other debris scattered about bear witness people there at all wherever you look there are Trenches that show out like great white scars. wherever they have been dug down into the chalk, and the ground between them is pitted with shell holes. some of the big dugouts remain but they are not altogether pleasant places to go through. I did not bother exploring them much. It will be many a long day before the country round there loses its battle scare. I had a nice letter from Mrs. H. a few days ago. She told me that Harold has Passed for the Artillery he wanted to get into the G.F.C. but they are full handed. When I heard from Harry last he was still allright, at school. he will be in a pretty good job if he passes his exams allright. now it is nearly tea time so I will have to stop and get back to billets or else I will miss my tea, and I cant afford to do that as this weather makes one very hungry so I will close with love to all especially yourself and Bett.
from your loving son Chas.
