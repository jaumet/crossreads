<p>1915<br/>Aug. 24 Tue.<br/>Every day I whack away at Le Fran&ccedil;ais and if I can't speak it fluently before leaving Egypt I shall eat my hat.<br/>Went in to Imp. Scouts Assn. meeting to-night at the Y.M.C.A. but only one other chap turned up. The troops are continually on the move &amp; it seems impossible to get the chaps together at present.<br/>Had one of my close crop hair cuts at the Sphinx Hairdressing Saloon (an Italian joint.)</p>
