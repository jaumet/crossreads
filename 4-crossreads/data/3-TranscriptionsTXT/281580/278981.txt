 At every turn there is some new interest to absorb one; even to the primitive tilling.  All sorts of beasts of burden are utilised and it is not infrequent to observe a camel yoked alongside a tiny donkey, drawing the primitive plough. I secured a very interesting series of pictures of the light Horse amidst these quaint surroundings and returned to Deiran 5 pm. 
 I have made arrangements to visit the front line positions tomorrow and will leave by car at 7 am.
