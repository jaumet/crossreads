  
 4. over a month since I got the last letter. Received one from Dorothy yesterday & she was expecting to get leave to go to  France  England for a week or more. Also received letters from three other Officers in different Battalions. They were all over a month old, so no doubt their letters are held up. It is lovely to get letters from my pals (men) & know they have not forgotten me.
