<p>Wednesday Nov 7th<br/>Still a very heavy swell on. This is a great old boat to roll. The wind is blowing behind us, we also have the current in our favour.</p>
<p>Thursday Nov 8th<br/>Deck billiards are all the go now. A good few matches have been played. Kept down below all day, as it was very windy &amp; cold up on top.</p>
<p>Friday Nov 9th<br/>Much better day. Sea much calmer. Expect to be in Fremantle on Monday morning. All the winches &amp; ropes have been got ready to start operations as soon as we arrive in port.</p>
<p>Saturday Nov 10th<br/>It was a very nice day today. The best we have had since leaving Capetown. Numerous comical posters have been put up, about different states. West Australia, Victoria &amp; N.S.W. have suffered most. We have an artist on board, &amp; he has contributed a good few very funny sketches.</p>
