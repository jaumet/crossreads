<p>It is for the reasons before mentioned that I did not keep a chick  my no licence principals are against pubs. I have not the cash to start a daylight robbery business therefore a chick would have been no use to me.</p>
<p>The  is a tree grows here known as the curlywally which may interest Betty it is a tree which is half a vine and it climbs about on itself in a most remarkable manner its long sprays being just the same as those of a vine having grips where with to hold on with. The first <strike>growth</strike> trunk of the tree vine can grow straight up unless it happens to be near another tree, when it is strong enough shoots <strike>come</strike> grow from the roots winding round the parent trunk. I have seen great twisted masses of these trees here in the lease. the wood when dead is harder than iron bark and polishes nicely. it is brown. it is also very tough &amp; makes nice whiphandles. I have got a piece here now which is almost as hard as ebony.</p>
<p>I must stop now with a cheer for King George &amp; merry England. if necessary I'll fight like wild cat for him &amp; his little island.</p>
<p>Much love to yourself &amp; all</p>
<p>from your loving son Alan L.</p>
