  
 Monday 1 March 1915 My wards in the hospital practically empty today. St. Davids day & Hy V th  IV-7-101 to 108.  Everything points to us moving at an early date from here  Not well today. The food here, eggs, cellery, onions, turnips, and these garnitures round the various insip[id] meats are horrid. I would not live here for all the mud in Egypt 
 Tuesday 2 March 1915 Wards still emptying.  At 11-30 p.m. left Mena House with Jerrom and eleven nurses & a guide for Sakkarah. Two camels and Twelve donkeys. I rode one donkey, "Telegraph" by name, there & back, being at least 16 miles across the desert (8 miles each way). The donk. a pleasant little beast to ride travels quite as rapidly as a camel. Carried my weight quite well. The tombs of the hills at Sakkarah, the most remarkable subjects viewed by me in Egypt. their weight & size, their being of granite, the lids. how they were got into position after coming down the river five hundred miles. Mirabile dictu. Very sick in my belly on arrival home. 
 Wednesday 3 March 1915 Much improved this morning, yet able to eat but little. Obtained Charcoal and pepsine tablets, have taken a few, hope they may do me good  Ordinary work about hospital. Dr Schuber t  called to see me. Very good of him.
