strolled off the have a look at the old historic town, to tell the truth she is a much larger busier town than ever I expected to find, plenty of trams running crowds of fashionably dressed people thronged the streets I expect the lovely day brought them out for it was nice sunny walking down one of the streets I bumped into Les Wayling had a chat to him.
In the middle of the town is a big market place
