Opening of Anzac Hostel in Egyptian Bourse at 7 pm. Declared open by General Godley in absence of Gen. Birdwood. A capital concert ? including Countess Lisandra, Countess Tullibardine, Tom Burrows, Mrs Hugh Buckland ("My Hero"). It is said in regard to Countess Lisandra's (of the Kursaal) performance that the Bishop of Jerusalem has written that he took umbrage at "the nude lady", whereas Col. Anderson, QMG, replied: "My dear Lord Bishop if you spent a few years in Australia, it would not only lessen the size of your hat but increase the capacity of your soul". Whereupon I suppose the Bishop went mad.
Issued with duplicate pay book to date from 27th Mch.
