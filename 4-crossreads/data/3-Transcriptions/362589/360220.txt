<p>Gallipoli<br/>20th Nov 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father<br/>What with the appearance of nice cold bracing weather, the disappearance of flies &amp; smells &amp;  the budgets of good news we have been getting the last few days, I'm as happy as the proverbial "bug in a rug". Most of yesterday afternoon I spent arguing <strike>that</strike> with the doctor about the present situation &amp; he put an end to the discussion by telling me that <strike>over</strike> excessive optimism was one of the first signs of insanity. This afternoon, still being in an argumentative state of mind, I sparred with my company commander about the meaning of a passage in Kings Rep. I'm pretty certain that I was wrong myself &ndash; at the beginning I was quite certain &ndash; but two hours talking brought my B.C. round &amp; made me very doubtful. All of us are very well, the cold weather is improving the general health of our battalion, &amp;, we hope, playing old <strike>Happy</strike> Harry with the ill equipped Turk. Kitchener was up here a few days ago, but as he did not enquire about me, I was offended &amp; refused to go &amp; see him. I hope this letter does not meet with the same fate as its predecessors, if it does please let me know, &amp; I'll write another to take its place dating it <strike>[indecipherable]</strike> back to the 20th.<br/>Yrs. Affect son Arthur.</p>
