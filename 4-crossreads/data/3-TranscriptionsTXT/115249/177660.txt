It appears that W/T station will take a long time to repair, therefore if you do not require to hold the station for military purposes I agree that it should be abandoned.  Will you give your own orders as you think fit, but I think you will require a fairly large garrison at Herbertshohe and someone there to treat with the Governor. I am proposing to Admiralty to retain the whole of the Troops in this vicinity until things have settled down here. 0800.
