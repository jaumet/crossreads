[Letterhead: 282 Burke Road, Upper Hawthorn. Melbourne Mansions, 101 Collins Street. Melbourne,]26/4/1922I have known Sister E.S. Thistlethwaite & her work since the end of 1914 when she sailed overseas with the First Australian General Hospital. Always whether on service overseas or at the Military Hospital at Caulfield she has been a most excellent nursing sister. I hold the very highest opinion of her work as a nurse    & of herself as a woman.Whatever work Sister Thistlethwaite takes up I am convinced she will do it with enthusiasm & it will be done well. I cannot adequately express how highly I value her services. She also is an excellent administrator.Walter Summons MD.
