<p>The island on the starboard bow was very mountainous;  a high cloud-topped and apparently active volcano was close to the straits with copra plantations and mills clearly visible at the foot.   The land to port was flatter and covered with mangroves.</p>
<p>The sea was a deep jade-green.   All prisoners were sent under-deck at 6 pm. but through the canvas curtain we could see that the straits were quite narrow.   On coming on deck next morning the vessel was in the open Indian Ocean, no land in sight and steering West.</p>
<p>Thur.  13th Sept.<br/>A most wonderful sunset today.   The whole of the western sky was a brilliant red and gold;   the black-painted ship herself was covered in a brilliant golden glare.</p>
<p>The colours gradually faded through all the shades of red and rose.</p>
