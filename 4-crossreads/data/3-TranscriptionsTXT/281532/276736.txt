Dull and misty. A great improvement in the appearance of the men today though our Battalion with its 3 companies is very small in size. They did ordinary work on the parade ground. I inspected the Transport Lines and found the horses rather pinched by the cold and right out in the open. There is a good amount of drunkenness going on. Why our fellows should be so vicious in this regard I don't know. Perhaps too much money is the cause but I know that the wineshop keepers are making fortunes. Sports in the afternoon. A dull grey afternoon. Very pretty undulating gentle country round here with little woods all round. In the distance the Vignacourt church stands out bold and high. Yarned with Madame & Mademoiselle round at the mess. They freely discuss quite forbidden topics.
