& appeared to be reviving when I looked & spoke to him. He went to sleep then & I think passed away in his sleep.  I think the fragment must have struck the artery & he died from loss of blood.
One of the men brought me over a snapshot of his grave when I was in Hospital in England & if you have not already got one I will have very much pleasure in sending it to you.  I have only the one snap at present but I am going to get some enlargements if I can.  It was a terrible blow to the Battery when your son was hit - the men absolutely worshipped him & it was difficult, my brother officers told me since, to keep the morale up.  It is to a certain extent good to think that the supreme sacrifice he made was not in vain  but the blow it was to myself & all who knew him on hearing of his death was perhaps more painful than anyone can realize.
I am at present still in Hospital but expect to get my discharge any day now.  Sincerely trusting that you are well in health & spirits Mr Garling, believe me to be  Yours in great sympathy
