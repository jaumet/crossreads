<p>Monday 1 September 1919<br/>Some day today. Very rough all day. In the evening a gale came to light. Made myself sick in the morning &amp; have been sick 3 times since. No good to me. Have read all day. Intend going to be early. Passed a schooner at lunch time.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2 September 1919<br/>Big sea again all day. Very little sleep last night on account of ship rolling. Quite a lot skipped for meals again today. Came third in the sweep &amp; collected 8/-. Makes &pound;4/8/- now I've collected. Am not quite OK again yet but am nearly so. Didn't miss any meals &amp; wasn't sick, but am still a little bit squamish. Am ships orderly officer tomorrow.</p>
