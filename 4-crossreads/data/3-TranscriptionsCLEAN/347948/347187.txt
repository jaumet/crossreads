  
 MARCHING SONG Of the RIFLEMEN'S BATTALION (36th) Words and Melody by Bandsman Sidney Young, 36th Batt. Band. Music Arranged by Edward H. Tyrrell, F.V.C.M. 
 Riflemen of every class unite in one endeavour, Pouring from bush and towns to fight for liberty; Vict'ry or death be the watchword, forever While the Flag of Britain flies Carmichael's Boys will be: 
 CHORUS Answering their Country in her Call for Men to go, Leaving aching hearts behind, to fight a foreign foe; They'll miss their Rifle Heroes, but ne'er would bid them stay, In their hearts they love the dear old Flag, like Rifle Boys to-day! 
 When they say their last good-byes and march away to glory, Headed by their Band, they go like sons of the brave; History will tell us the Riflemen's story, How he ventured all to win or die, his Land to save.
