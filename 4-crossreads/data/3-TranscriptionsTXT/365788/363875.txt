4unless we go to England I wont want any now.Poor old Fred! Do you know I have not had a letter from her for about 3 months (I think it is). I think Alister Stobo is at the Aerodrome Camp Cairo & will write & give him a little good advice. A large Camel Caravan is just passing - So far it is a quarter of a mile long but I don't know how much more is to come. Au-revoir dear Sister mine. With very much love to you all.Your loving brotherFred
