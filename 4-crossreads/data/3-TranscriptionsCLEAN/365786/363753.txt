  
 their mates, while waiting for reinforcements which never arrived or arrived too late.  Yet all this time since this war began, men fit & well, many without a tie save their own selfish desires, hug their safe billets in this remote country, making up their minds not go to till made  & now  altho' told by all our best leaders that  now  more than ever men are needed, these men I say who won't go unless made to go are they to be the ones to say whether or no they will go?  The thing is unthinkable.  So each one of us here must do all we can to see that our men, those dear ones of whom we are always thinking, shall receive the reinforcements necessary not only for our safety & that of the Empire but also for their health & to give them a better chance of returning  in the future  when the war is ended.
