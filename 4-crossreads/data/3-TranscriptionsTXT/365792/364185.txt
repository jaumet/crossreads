Apl 14  Meteren last night & had a look round. There are scores of motor transports all over the place, & all sorts of troops:- Tommies, Canadians, Frenchies, Scots, & Australians. Bough a tin of boot polish (small size) for 11/2. Been amusing ourselves looking at an old sow & her litter of 9 silky little piglets. You should have seen them at feeding time. There are 2 rows of teats (12 in all) & by gee they made the pace a welter. After a few minutes their bellies were swollen properly & the old sow was getting a bit uneasy. (No wonder either, with 9 of the young beggars draining the life out of her - Talk about mud, this place is a regular quagmire. An hours route marching after dinner (full pack) with the band in front. On our way back there was a light fall of snow & sleet & rain & we dashed near froze. Too cold for me this France
