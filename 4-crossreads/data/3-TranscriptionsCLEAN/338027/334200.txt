Friday, 25 June, 1915Boat making great speed 16 knots, we are working hard but everything is going well, here let me say a word in praise of our Mr. O., whatever he was in the past, he has made up for now, he has worked untiringly, his organization is splendid, he runs the whole boat by a splendid system which can only be carried out by us working correspondingly and we are doing it, I was put down in the officers ward to day, with 56 of them and I did not reign long only the day, I would rather nurse savages than be dictated to by those conceited English aristocrats they treat an orderly like a valet, it was too XXXX for me and I could not stand it, and I told one what I thought of him and was reported then I threw the job in, one got a good dressing down from an Aust, and he wont forget it.
Saturday, 26 June, 1915At it all day I was on night duty last night, last relief, 2.30 to 5.30 Reveille, makes it a long day we arrived at Alex- about six and went alongside, thereby making a record trip, fast time and through our good work managed to reach our destination with 900 wounded & sick, not a death & no complaints, to-morrow they will go off.  Every man is proud of his mates and the Austs on board are proud of us whilst the Tommies congrat us, of all the lot would rather nurse British than Aust as the latter is a born growler.
