<p>I only knew about it the night before I left &amp; went to look him up but he was out when I called so did not have an opportunity of seeing him.</p>
<p>I have not been getting my mail lately, my movements have been so uncertain that I could not have it readdressed. I hope there will be a large bundle of letters waiting for me when I rejoin.</p>
<p>I am doing all I can to get back to the Battalion now, but it is very uncertain how long I shall remain here. It might be days or weeks &amp; no one can give you any information.</p>
<p>Best Love to Mrs Ferguson &amp; Dorothy</p>
<p>Yours affectionately</p>
