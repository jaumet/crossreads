paths lie in the flowery rich places and we see nothing of the life lived by 99% of the people. One mile's radius from the Opera covers all our travelling and knowledge and most who think they know Paris, ?know" London similarly ? by an extensive acquaintance with Piccadilly.

LtCol Hon M.V.Brett was most aimiable on interview this morning and possesses a few decorations (including the Legion de Honneur) and Zena Dare for a wife. Today is a dull day a little chilly. Went on a fruitless quest for the Elysee Palace ? it was dusk and from here looking back towards the Place de la Concorde the sight was remarkable. This beautiful street all alive with the lamps of scores of taxicabs. At hotel donned mufti the first time for 3 years and felt very strange.
