I was sleeping on hand grenades some of ours some of Fritz's in the dark I thought them only stones the place was literally strewn with shrapnel shell cases dud shells such a plowed up mess. These were some of Fritz's trenches where he had been excellently been dug in with 50ft funk holes, passages, beds, electric lighting, cupboards, stores, chairs; besides other homely conveniences too numerous to detail.
Had parade later, 9am. practiced puting up wire entanglements
