<p>the afternoon sick car. Spent about an hour strolling round the town buying some papers and postcards also had a look at the church, a fine large building, plain but massive inside, windows few and medium. Had tea of omelette bread &amp; tea for 7.3. then went round to the new Theatre where the Anzac Coves were playing. My friend knew some of the performers &ndash; we spent an interesting half hour yarning and watching them makeup. The show itself was first rate apart from the first half. It was a farce entitled Saa Eeda Digger &amp; dealt with incidents of Cairo 1915. The jokes were good and topical, reference being made occasionally to Sydney &amp; Melbourne. Set off home about 9 P.M.<br/>Sunday 27thOct.<br/> Spent a good part of the day wading through old files of receipts etc trying to draw up a statement, (which will hold water) of why we would not return the equipment asked</p>
