<p>in front, and the Albert Bapaume road with its border of tall</p>
<p>trees was now in view for a couple of miles towards Bapaume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The war now took on the form of a succession of</p>
<p>moves.&nbsp; We were hampered by bad weather both in regard to fogs</p>
<p>which prevented our aeroplanes from informing us just where the</p>
<p>enemy was each time he moved and also the heavy mud made the</p>
<p>matter of bringing our big guns up a difficult job indeed.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>enemy couldn&#39;t have had better weather for the carrying out of his</p>
<p>plans as we were certainly prevented from harassing him as much as</p>
<p>we should have liked, by the two factors I have mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of a week he had gone back altogether</p>
<p>about two miles.&nbsp; Here he made a temporary halt for about 6 days</p>
<p>during which my Battalion twice attacked him and succeeded each</p>

<p>waiting for him that he simply walks out of one into another.</p>
<p>Everywhere barbed wire entanglements of great depths were</p>
<p>encountered.&nbsp; Against these, frontal attacks by infantry without</p>
<p>proper heavy artillery support, are only courting disaster.&nbsp; Our</p>
<p>guns were still floundering in the mud and as fast as they would</p>
<p>get into position and start to range on Fritz&#39; line,off he would</p>
<p>gox and the artillery would have to dig the guns out and start</p>
<p>after him again.&nbsp; Everywhere were caterpillars and traction</p>
<p>engines to be seen dragging huge howitzers about whilst horses</p>
<p>and mules struggled through the mud with the lighter guns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Light railways were pushed forward in remarkably</p>
<p>short time so that we suffered not at all by delays to our supplies</p>
<p>ammunition, etc.&nbsp; A heavily wired trench system known as</p>
<p>Grevillers Line was next occupied by the enemy and it was thought</p>
