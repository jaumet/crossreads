<p>Northampton War Hospital<br/>14.6.17</p>
<p>Dear Mother,<br/>Just received a couple of home letters dated 10th and 24th March. I was extremely glad to get them as they are the first I have had since coming to this hospital. I am feeling tip top, will soon be able to walk around on a <strike>crutch/</strike> stick, I have had crutches for the last week or so. I was very pleased to know that you were all well and to hear of Rose's marriage. I am sending along a few photos that I had taken in the grounds. You may expect a long letter from me in a day or so mother. The chaps who are on each side of me are just chance hospital acquaintances. Had some more photos taken but they haven't turned up yet.<br/>You may expect them very shortly.<br/>With best love to you all<br/>Your loving son<br/>Gordon</p>
