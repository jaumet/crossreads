 result of an all night sit dure which three Major faint , and one Lt . Col . and two Col . 's were hastili evacu to the Clear Station , suffer from sever mental strain , the follow order was issu on the 18th . [ Note repetit of date and materi ] " The order prohibit the wear of short when ride out of Camp is constant be disregard by the N.C.O. 's and men . To ensur the observ of this order therefor , all short issu to N.C.O. 's and men , and now in their possess , must be hand into the Q.M. 's Store by 4.30 today . " In spite of the undoubt brillianc of this strateg movement , design to outflank us and compel an instant surrend , it fell absolut flat much to the disgust and chagrin of the hostil forc . This was due to the fact that we had no issu short ( those mention abov not be distribut yet ) and the one we wore be bought privat . The constern produc in enemi High Command by the defeat of the previous order was a tame thing compar to the confus [confus ] produc brought about by this latest discomfitur . With impress celer , howev , for such a letharg bodi they met the situat by a counter-ord to the effect that the C. in C. himself would be round the various unit on the 19th and if ani man was seen to be wear the accurs garment in question , the O.C. of such Unit would be court martial . This was would have been exceed satisfactori to us , if it had not been that one veri import claus was omit viz. , that on no account would the O.C. be allow to pass the Court Martial on . Today the 20th the threat of yesterday was follow up by an order that " no man was to wear short in Camp or out , at ani time " and there the matter stand , and no man know just how it will end . By all the law of preced and general Militari procedur , it should end in us all be issu with short veri soon , with a command to wear them sleep and wake , under or be shot at dawn . Meanwhil with the smoke of battl still obscur the landscap and the thunder of the recent conflict yet reverber among the hill of the Jordan , I want to state an obscur and unimport fact . After wear my first issu of Australian boot for just over two year , I am compel , with other , to wear in place of new one , second hand Tommi boot fear and wonder patch and half sole , which crippl the feet , wear out a pair of sock everi second day and possess " an affluvium " [effluvium ] all their own in comparison to which all the various and combin odour of the East are violet and lavend . True it is onli about three month sinc I put in for my new one , and vital question have been occupi the Militari intellect of late , so I must not be impati . This all import short question is veri near settl to the discomfitur of the troop and the Ration of Red Tape , so whi worri about boot ? They are thing of minor import .
