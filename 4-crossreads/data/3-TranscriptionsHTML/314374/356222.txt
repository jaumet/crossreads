<p>(38)<br/>The next five days we were on working parties at Heilly, constructing a huge bomb proof and shell proof dugout in an old wall there.  One afternoon I had just emerged form the dugout with a bucketful of earth, when a shell fell close by &ndash; a large piece of the shell flying past my head and knocking a stone out of the wall &ndash; a narrow escape!</p>
<p>The weather was now beginning to get nice as Spring was coming.  I often used to go into the little Church at La Hussoye and play the organ.  Every time the guns were fired the building would shake (our batteries were close by).  Everything in the church was as the people had left them.  The decorations and beautiful vestments were much admired by all the soldiers who visited it.  Every night the German airmen bombed the town, but no damage was done, the bombs falling into open fields.</p>
<p>On the night of 5th May, just after midnight, the enemy commenced to shell the town for the first time, but all the shells fell into a paddock only about a hundred yards from our billets, killing many.  While here we had several good concerts which were held in a large aeroplane hangar.</p>
<p>On the morning of 6th May we marched five kilos further on to the important juncture town of Querrieu (also evactuated) and great activity prevailed here, there being thousands of Americans (as well as Australians) camped here.  The Americans amused us by their sayings &ndash; used to ask at the canteen for a can (not tin) of cigarettes, or a bunch, (not packet) of cigarettes &amp;c.</p>
<p>Whilst here we were given hot baths with fresh clothes (free from vermin) which made things more pleasant and comfortable for us.</p>
<p>We were also reviewed one day by Sir Douglas Haig and one day when we were all in swimming, one of the men from the 33rd Battalion was drowned.</p>
<p>The trying times that we had been through were now telling on us and we were all knocked up and in need of a rest.  We had been forty two days in or near the front line continuously.</p>
<p>Many were now ill with trench fever, being evactuated daily, and on the morning of 8th May I was myself removed to Hospital (which was several tents erected in the convent grounds) suffering with trench fever and a poisoned thumb &ndash; the latter being caused through enemy barbed wire.</p>
<p>I remained here three days being very sick with fever and having no sleep.  Every night we were heavily bombed &ndash; many bombs falling quite close to us &ndash; although we had large red crosses painted on our tents &ndash; but luckily only horses and mules were killed.</p>
<p>As I got no better I was taken on 8th May in Red Cross Motor Ambulance (via the outskirts of Amiens) to Allonville Field Hospital.  As we passed through Amiens it was being shelled and shrapnel was bursting over the city.</p>
