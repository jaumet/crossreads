  
 21 August 1918 Wednesday (X to X crossed out) Arrived once more at Jericho smothered in dust the men would prefer 28 days in the detention "cells" at the "Citadel" to life down here it would do a lot of good to some  of the money-grabbing  slackers at home. We go on tonight to the trenches, mostly colored troops down here. X Will post this tonight just to let you see alls well Love to you all at home.  I know how you must miss Joe- but we will all come back some day-   FM.
