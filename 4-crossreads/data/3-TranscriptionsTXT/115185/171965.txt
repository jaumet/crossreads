The next afternoon Lady Graham & her son Stuart had afternoon tea with us - and Alma's boys as I call them came for us in a lovely car at 7 pm, and motored us in to dinner and back again at 10 pm. Saturday I rested - Captain Evans came to tea & dinner with Sister de Mestre and she asked me to help her entertain him. He is a man I knew at P.A.H. a very nice boy. The year after Archie. He is [indecipherable] of 10th Light Horse - who go away soon - on Sunday. Alma's Cousin Charlie Dowe came for us in a carriage and drove us to see the Zoological gardens - a lovely place full of tropical plants & wondrous animals a lynx - reptiles and birds. I loved a large cat so graceful with extraordinary ears like on a jesters cap. There are beautiful large trees - Father would love them - and the lake with Swans - pelicans & wild ducks. The hippopotamus does just what his keeper tells him like a human being.
