<p>Friday 30 June 1916<br/>Just before daybreak heavy firing away on our right indicated an attack launched by the British but with what success we could not discover. A cold windy morning with occasional driving showers, but clear in the afternoon &amp; ground drying up quickly. Censoring &amp; writing letters all available time. Aust. mail of 23 Apl. arrived. In the evening there was a flight of no less than 18 of our aeroplanes which appeared to have been out on a raiding expedition. The sky was absolutely speckled with the bursts of shrapnel, more than 1000 shots being fired in one sector. The night was expected to be very lively but turned out to be exceptionally quiet.</p>
