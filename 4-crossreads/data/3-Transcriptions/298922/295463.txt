<p>Thursday 17 May 1917</p>
<p>Still outpost. We used to be called the "KIWI" LANCERS in HELIOPOLIS but I am afraid there is nothing of the "exquisite" about us now.</p>
<p>One of our "planes" down today, the pilot rode home on the Tail of his mates machine.</p>
<p>Will post this as we go on a raid tomorrow &amp; I don't like running the risk of being blown out or captured with any Diary on me.</p>
<p><strike>Love to all, hoping ere long we may all be together again.</strike></p>
