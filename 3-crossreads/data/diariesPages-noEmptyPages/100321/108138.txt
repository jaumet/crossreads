16/1/19 Namur
fine chateaux nestling in woods. The river fine and broad was in spate. High on either side rose rugged bluffs. We reached Namur at about 11 and its forts overlooking the Meuse seemed unhurt. The town was a busy residential one but there were no signs of factories. It seemed a better town than Amiens was. We swung out of here over rolling open country passing through pretty diversified country including much woodland until we reached Louvain. Here we made a stop noticing the elaborate faade of Eglise St Michel into which we could not get. Continuing to the square we found the whole placed as razed as parts of Abbeville. The celebrated library exists no more save as a heap of ruins. The Hotel de Ville is uninjured and
