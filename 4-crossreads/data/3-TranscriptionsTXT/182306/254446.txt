had a good time there. Went all round the Town in rickshaws It is one of the prettiest Places I have seen there so far. and were sorry to leave it. Left on the 3rd Dec. Arrived at Cape Town on the 6th. Did not like the place It looked very dirty to me. Just the oposite to Durban Were there 16 days. We took a trip to Camp's Bay and to the Top ot the Table Mountain & got a lot of [Tilber?] Leaves
