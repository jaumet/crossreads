 1st Field Ambulance Mudros West Lemnos. Is. 9 Oct 15 My dearest Sister, It seems so very uncertain what our future movements will be that I will cancel the suggestion which I made in a previous letter to you about sending my letters to 2nd Stationary Hospital. Please send them till further notice to No. 2 General Hospital as before &amp; they will forward them. Please ring up Trix &amp; Neil Sherwin &amp; tell them &ndash; Absolutely no news &ndash; but will write now &amp; then to let you know I am well.  Much love to you all, Your loving brother, Fred
