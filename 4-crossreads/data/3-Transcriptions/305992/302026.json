<p>July 21st Sunday<br/>9 am Left our moorings &amp; went to dry dock for cleaning ship's bottom &amp; painting. Also both aft shafts drawn out, also propellors taken off for repacking. The ship's bottom examined &amp; found distinct dents in plates for a matter of a hundred feet from port side to starboard where we had struck a submarine &amp; sunk one a few month ago off the coast of Sardinia. The impression on the plates under the ship's bottom as plain as if the marks had been chiseled out by man. The marks of the rail of the conning tower very visible &amp; plain.</p>
