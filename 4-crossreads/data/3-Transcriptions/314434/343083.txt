<p>Statement made by Private Petersen of the 19th Battalion, 5th Brigade, A.I.F. to Private F.J. Brewer, who took same down in shorthand (original notes attached). Private Petersen, who was present at the battle made this statement on the 9th February, 1919, on the "City of York", on which transport, narrator and recorder, were returning to Australia. He stated:-</p>
<p>"My Battalion had been resting near Fuse, and afterwards had been carrying on skirmishing with the retreating Huns for several days before Mont St Quentin was taken. The Huns were fighting rearguard actions. We encountered strong machine gun fire some being mounting in trees.<br/>"We withdrew* and then crossed the Somme, and were told beforehand that we were to take Mont St Quentin,<br/>"We marched straight on and crossed near several bridges under shell fire marched up past Clery, and were then told to go straight on for the job."<br/>"Suddenly Fritz sent up three flares, and we saw the flames of several machine guns firing, and on the way saw diggers</p>
<p>*At this time the 18th Battalion was operating somewhere near Bazincourt Wood, or Mericourt Wood. See map 3, Appendix 1.</p>
