<p>27.7.15<br/>Tue. 27th.  Tommies have arrived here &amp; are taking over the Army Service work on the beach.  Mark 7 ammunition <strike>h</strike> is also arriving &amp; as it will not fit our rifles a rumor is gaining ground that we are likely to soon be relieved by English Tommies &amp; we will make a move goodness knows where.  Murga Mack arrived back to-day he was sent to Cairo &amp; appears to have had a good time as he looks very well on it.  Dr. Wells also showed up this morning but was at once ordered back to the beach, it is said he had a row with Col. Meredith at Heliopolis &amp; came over here without permission &amp; has to go back again &amp; no one here is sorry.  Fiaschi is the man we want, he has been busy to-day inoculating us against Cholera.  A good deal of artillery firing going on this afternoon from both sides.  We were relieved from the phone at 12 oclock.</p>
