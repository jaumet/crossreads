Dear Dad, This is just a view of our landing place from Blighty. Nearly all streets over here are Cobblestones & they collect all the filth. Ellis has just gone down town for a run on the car but it is too cold & there is nothing to see. I went down yesterday at 2 pm & had a good tour all round by the Docks & up the Main streets. It is better here to see the place in daylight, one does not see so much dirt, We are having icy weather now & bed is very hard to leave in the morning. I've lots of work to do & it is all strange. We are both well but have no interesting things to tell you about Just now .  Love  Harry
