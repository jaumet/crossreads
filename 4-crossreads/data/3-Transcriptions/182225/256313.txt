<p>JULY &nbsp; THURSDAY 13 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Cold &amp; dull all day. The headquarters staff all went out to Stonehenge for a walk. It is marvellous how the people who built it in days gone bye got the stones there &amp; put them up. It would be a fair job now with all our cranes ect. Had some more practise with flags in afternoon. Bill Hunter, Self Warren, Bill Nesbitt, &amp; Tom Reed got a car &amp; went into Salisbury for tea. We had dinner at the &quot;Cathedral Hotel&quot; and had a look round the town &amp; cathedral, but the Cathedral was closed &amp; we could only see the outside</p>
