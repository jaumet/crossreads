<p>21/5/19<br/>London<br/>expensive and they charge for the old ways. Sat in Dr Johnson's seat. Afterwards did the Strand, Leicester Sq &amp; Piccadilly where much bargaining was going on. I have seen no city where prostitution is so brazenly evident as in London. The hotels are now open till 10.30 and there were many people a bit merry. In the bars women mingle with the men draining their pots and smoking. In Paris women take their drink in a more refined way &ndash; sitting at a table. The tubes are handy but antiquated and vilely ventilated. Went to Trafalgar Square and paid a guinea for a balcony stall at Therese &amp; Pagliacci at Covent Garden tonight. Returned to the hotel at Paddington &ndash; the Norfolk &ndash; and was fast asleep by midnight. The moving stairways in London tubes are a great idea and could be extended and made to move faster.</p>
