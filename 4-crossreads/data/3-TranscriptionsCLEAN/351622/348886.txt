7 September 1916 ThurReveille 6 am. The big Guns are going for their life at different intervals throughout the day. It has been on the whole a very quiet day. I went to the estaminet with Cliff & Dick at dinner time & partook of a few Belgium Beers. I went on a message to headquarters at Poperinge at 7.30 in one of the cars. Brought the mail back.
