 I do not know if you have heard from anyone in this Bn. and I felt it my duty to inform you of how your brave son, and my mate gave his life for his King and Country. 
 I fully realise the severe blow you have received in losing a good son, but I trust that the way in which he gave his life, that it will help you considerably to bear your grief and sorrow.  I will not attempt to give you any news at the present time, only that I am in good health. 
 Kindly accept my deepest sympathy, I remain, yours sincerely, Wal Court
