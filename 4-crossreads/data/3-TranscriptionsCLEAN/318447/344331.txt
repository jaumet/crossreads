  
 Anyway there is some very heavy stuff being bandied about here now. We are up here in reserve acting I believe as divisional troops for infantry. 
 I am a pitifully sordid object just now, bandages are very scarce now & so we have to keep our ad infinitum. 
 I spent most of the halts on the trek up here tenderly undoing one sceptic sore after another & spitting on it to keep the swelling & pain out of it. Imagine me, all one
