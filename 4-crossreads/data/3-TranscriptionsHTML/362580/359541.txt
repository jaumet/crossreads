<p>The weather is getting much warmer but to-day has been delightful.</p>
<p>We have not heard anything of a move for us yet, some fighting has taken place not very far from here but we have not got any of the wounded.</p>
<p>Oh, I just hate to think of the poor wounded fellows.  How I wish this war would end.  I'm very much afraid this letter is not very interesting</p>
<p>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>your loving sister<br/>Edith.</p>
