  
 124 as at Fenquieres though as for myself I am more at home here than there for I have condescended to speak French. 
 To night I borrow a horse & ride over to the Chinese Camp near Fenquieres to say good bye to friends but find most of them gone Little & [blank space] are the only ones left. They invite me on to dinner & after dinner I return to say good bye to Mde. Boulinger & then return to join Prentice at old Battalion HQ. 
 Then we commence our ride home through the inky blackness lighted only by glow worms when road cuts deep into the earth. The sky is clouded & a thick driving mist damps us through & through. You cannot see 3 ft away except when the horses hoofs on the flinty stones strikes fire. 
 The road between the trees beautiful by day is as mysterious in its silence by night. Not a sound even of a cricket & the tramp of the horses which seemed alien to the surroundings. Peace Perfect peace indeed it seemed but who knows what awful carnage & tragedy was being carried on in natures realm. 
 Arrived back in camp about 11 pm & put the horses up & retired wet but pensive
