<p>substitute for a Turkish bath.  It's marvellous the work that is done in those gallies.  There is only a very limited space to cook for the number we have on board, &amp; yet they do it sufficiently well to avoid complaints from the men, &amp; that is really an accomplishment to be proud of.  You may go into that galley any time during the day, &amp; you'll see five or six men going hell for leather to have the next meal ready.  The next letter will probably be written ashore.  I forgot to mention before, that we are being so well looked after that I will be able to send down to my men, twelve pounds of pound cake &amp; two tins of biscuits.  I am finishing this letter during a night watch, in the intervals between my rounds &amp; so it is probably pretty disconnected.  I got everything that you sent aboard including a letter which has the power to cheer me up whenever I lapse into "That sweet mood when pleasant thoughts bring sad thoughts to the mind".  Probably I have misquoted, but still you know what I wish to express.  I must say goodbye now till next mail.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son,<br/>Arthur</p>
