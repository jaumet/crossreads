trenches among the scrub  & wild flowers   & in time they became such a nuisance that we had to give them an armistice to bury them.  I was about three weeks in the trenches   & was hit in the leg by a fragment of shrapnel  & so have been sent to Malta - a hospital base - I expect to be here some time as the above address will find me.The bone of my leg is not injured so I expect it will heal up alright though of course it will take time.  I hope you are all well with love to all from your affectionate sonCharlieover
