I say the start, because though it is now 3 months since we took the momentous step and embarked on a <strike>soldiers life</strike> soldiering career, yet for the first time we may be said to have really begun the game in deadly earnest, for the remainder has been all preparation, hard preparation it is true and a ceaseless round of real hard work, but yet only preparation and not the real thing.</p>
