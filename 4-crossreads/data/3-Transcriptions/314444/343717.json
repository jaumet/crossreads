<p>Rollestone,<br/>13/11/16</p>
<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Recieved your very welcome letter. Glad to know you are all well. It is a glorious day today. Exactly like a summer's day in Sydney. It is a grand change after all the rain we have been getting.<br/>Ask Doss does she know the Picadilly Restaurant. I have had some lovely dinners there &amp; been to a lot of theatres. So you see I am having a good time. I am still Sgt Caterer &amp; likely to be for some considerable time. Yes it was a touch &amp; go whether they took my leg off or not, all the same I was dead against it &amp; would have let "em" know before they did take it off. At all events it is alright now only for a slight limp, which I think I will always have.<br/>Hoping you are all well<br/>Best wishes &amp; love<br/>your loving son<br/>Tom</p>
