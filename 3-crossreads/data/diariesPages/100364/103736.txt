There was no drought in the Liquor, which however, I am pleased to say, was not imbibed to excess. The rain pelted deafeningly on the big tent, but this only had the effect of making everyone sing louder or dance wilder. It seemed impossible that such merriment could exist in such an obscure and forsaken place:- a tiny square of desert sand, whose grains have drifted for countless ages, covered by a thin roof of canvas. But I believe our boys would enjoy themselves even in Hades itself. I have seen them hand in hand with death, singing and gay; under a hail of shellfire, in the frightfulness of winter warfare, blistering and thirsty in the desert, unaltered. Surely a nation must become great that breeds such men as these. Heavy rains all night and, everything in flood.
