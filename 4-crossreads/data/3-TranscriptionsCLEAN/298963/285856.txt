We went to the right men & put our hands into our right pockets and a few franks the poorer went in & saw the wonders of Picardy.
For the whole day we wandered about the city, seeing what was to be seen, & admiring with opened eyes the scenes of a once beautiful France.  I am sitting on a bank beside the River Somme to write this, the ful fledge of spring has covered all.  For miles & miles on all sides, as far as the eye can reach the ground has been trodden by nailed feet, but now I must go back to the train to return to our little wet homes.
