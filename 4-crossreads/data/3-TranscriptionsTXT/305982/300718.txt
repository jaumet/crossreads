31/7/16We arrived at Albert about 9.30 last night it was very very close marching we passed through numerous villages inroute, we slept in an open paddock last night Blankets & waterproof & overcoat rather cool we had a drink of tea.  we went out on a salvage job to day at La Bassie what a terrible mess things are in.  trenches levelled with the ground (filled in)  German dug outs  are wonderful pieces of work about 30 feet under ground. beds etc they seem to have made all preparations to stop there.  some of the dug outs are untouched.  Mine craters  ground full of shell holes.  shells falling about to day.  we have some great guns here 12 inch ones all over the place Ovillers & La Bassye there is not a wall left standing it must have been a terrible struggle advancing, we arrived back in camp about 6 oclock  I went in the town & had a good look around.  it is smashed up some what.  the main church there is broken completely up the statue is smashed or rather leant
