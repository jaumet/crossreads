<p>November 9<br/>115.<br/>This morning at 10 oclock, in the Cemetry here, the bodies of Snowy, Heinz, and Muntz &ndash; brought down by the Bearers,: buried.  No surpliced Minister &ndash; nor even a Padre &ndash; a short service by some Captain&hellip;</p>
<p>116.<br/>The Crosses waiting here since the first stunting of Sept., Oct. taken up by Syd and Neeve today.,,</p>
<p>The wagons loaded:  they leave tomorrow &ndash; we on Sunday.</p>
<p>117.<br/>There is a tale after the manner of Boccaccio in "Sinister St."&hellip; Clarrie's blanks last night and tonight recall it&hellip;..</p>
<p>All of us had roughly three blankets each, after an hour at the C.M.D.S&hellip;.when we put our beds down and, turned  in, one of Clarrie's was 'missing' and his complaints waxed lewd and complimentary &ndash; turning in finally with Ridge's greatcoat taking the missing blanket's place&hellip;tonight there are six blankets where this morning he had two, he 'grunted' only one.</p>
<p>Mail today &ndash; Registered from Harold of a 15/- note&hellip;  In a week I'll forward it to Bakers for Symons' "Ideas of God and Evil" &ndash; or to Beaumonts if "Herod" turns up for Masefield's "Daffodil Fields" and "Dauber".  17 days since I wrote them!</p>
<p>November 10<br/>118.<br/>Early cold:  and raining now&hellip;  A marching order parade, full  packs up at 9.30 &ndash; inspection and dismiss:  general fatigue cleaning up station&hellip;  The wagons have left in dull horrible rain.</p>
<p>Last night the contrast between the old A Sectioniles and the new [indecipherable]:  our end of the Marquee Clarrie, Toby, Ridge, Mills and self, with the new men Harold, Tony and Galloway.  Ridge with his dry lewd humour and Clarrie's responding [indecipherable] in Toby and self&hellip;.  The rest of the tent grousing.  Harry B. deploring the horrors of service, and new opinions by new men windying the air.  Ridge is by Aristophanes.</p>
<p>Yesterday saw George Eaton, from him selection of English Prose of Masefield's&hellip; 'To-Days' he's sent on to "Muston".</p>
<p>Through the blown raining on the Marquee, the full throbbing of a new bombardment.</p>
<p>Early in the morning I dreamed of a book holding in its end pages a full list of books of verse by J.C. Squires.. of small books each of only 12 to twenty Poems.. and of a series of "Lily of Malud" &ndash; each small slim book the episode of a long lovely tale.</p>
