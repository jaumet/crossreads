<p>disclose a very strict show of dicipline Individual NCO's would occasionally endeavour to show their "extra" authority but upon ascertaining facts these men invariably were found to be "Bachsheesh" Corporals &amp; Sergeants, or in other words, they were simply privates who, rightly or wrongly, had been made temporary NCOs while in Camp, no doubt, by personal acquaintances who had been longer in Camp.</p>
<p>The life here was, as regards drill etc, fairly easy, for all except those really fit, simply refused to do anything, except attend the parades of which there were only two, one at 9.30 am, the other at 2 pm.</p>
<p>Of course this was the result of turning men out of Hospitals before they were properly cured.</p>
<p>When, probably through an effort made by some one, more officious than tactful, they tried to get the men to attend a parade at 6.30 am the order was met by a distinct refusal by practically the whole Camp. Out of 5000 or 6000 men only 300 turned up on parade, &amp; as the men had been roused to such a pitch, an order had at once to be issued that the morning parade would be "cut out," otherwise they threatened to refuse to parade at all.</p>
<p>Naturally after this incident no drill was taken seriously &amp; practically the men did as they liked. This therefore "rushed" the granting of furlough, to every one entitled to it.</p>
<p>Perham Downs was absolutely the very worst camp so far experienced. Winter had started to show its hoary head &amp; the continuous wet weather turned the whole Camp into a perfect quagmire of mud, even the duck boards were dangerous to walk upon. It was looked upon then as the limit, but of course at this time no one had the least idea as to what was to be endured in France, with Cold, snow, &amp; Ice, &amp; "proper" mud, during that never to be forgotten (1916/17) winter</p>
<p>The announcement about furlough,</p>
