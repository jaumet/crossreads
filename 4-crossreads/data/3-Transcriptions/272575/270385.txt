<p>had I received them earlier I could have used nearly all of them but that cannot be helped, now, the sites picked for camps are good, but they are in the most out of the way, and inconvenient place that anyone could have selected, it is a good way, too, as it makes it awkward for week enders, and the camps are free from visitors    Thank Betty for her letter which was enclosed with yours.   I received your letter with Pansy enclosed.   I am fixing the Pansy in my Auto Book I have only just started the book and at present only have 4 names, "nurses at the Hosp. -   I think Eric Elder is on the clerical staff at Bhurtpore Barracks, Tidworth but am not certain.   Harry does not seem from the tone of his letter to have fallen in love with Seymour camp.   well I have heard reports about the place that were not in its favour.   it is nearly as nice as Black boys in W.A. where we were supposed to stay "but failed to do so.    I still get letters from W.A. from my little W.A. Girl    I dont know whether I ever mentioned her before or not, a few days ago, I received a letter with her Photo enclosed    I had been expecting that letter for some time and had begun to think that it was lost.   The funny part of it is I never saw her before I was aboard the boat, ready to leave, the W.A. boat was just swinging out when I decided that I would throw her my name and address attached to a little flag that one of the boys had when we left Sydney.  She seemed, very pleased, and went home, and sat down and wrote to me</p>
