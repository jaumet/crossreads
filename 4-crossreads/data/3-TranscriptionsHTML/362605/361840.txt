<p>He will visit D.J's while there to get some money for both of us.  We are due for 14 days leave &amp; haven't a sous to bless ourselves with.  I have had a lot of work since coming back to this place but I am pleased to say that I have got everything straight now &amp; I am not so pushed.  I have received one or two odd letters from Aussie but we have not received any from you for about 2 months.  The mail is just coming in by dribs and drabs.</p>
<p>We have heard no further news about our return.  It has all been held up on account of the Strikes.  We are naturally very very anxious to Home but we have to wait until we are sent now.</p>
<p>Well, Dad, Mum &amp; George, I have no news to give you at all now.  We are both well &amp; are as happy as can be for we know that within a very few months we will all be re-united.</p>
<p>Fondest Love to You all &amp; to all My Dear Friends.  I have not written to any of them for weeks.  I have been too busy all day &amp; until about a week ago I had one of my old attacks which quite O.K. now.<br/>Love Harry</p>
