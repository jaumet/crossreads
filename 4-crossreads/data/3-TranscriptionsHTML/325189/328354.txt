<p>Egyptian gentleman but as he did not understand English we could not get on much.  I had a little book containing phrases in Arabic &amp; I read out a few of these.  He seemed highly amused.  His son, 14 yrs old, then came into the garden &amp; he could speak English very well.  We spent the whole afternoon with them &amp; he asked us to come next Friday when he had a holiday &amp; he would show us round.  His address is &ndash; Egypt, Cairo,<br/>Sabtieh St.,<br/>Abbas School,<br/>Ahmed Mohamed Anwer</p>
