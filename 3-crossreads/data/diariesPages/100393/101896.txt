of course had numerous baths. As I stated before we broke the defences of the Hindenberg Line and of course our exact positions were known to the enemy having just evacuated. This resulted in in a "dinkum" bombardment. Fritz shelled us without ceasing for the three days nights. Our little trench was only about 2 feet wide by about 20 feet in length something after this shape.

Apart from the hundreds of shells that landed all around our posse we had one right on our parapet two right in the trench which unfortunately was the means of killing a couple of poor chaps wounding several the rest of us were rather shaken up with the concussion because the shells (one in particular) were large. Our trench was blown about a good deal but we did not trouble to build it up again on account of the heavy shelling.This was a very successful stunt below is a rough sketch of where we advanced.
