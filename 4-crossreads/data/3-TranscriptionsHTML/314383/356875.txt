<p>May 20<br/>Old Scotty &amp; I had a look thro the bazaar with Zillaman as a sort of guide.  The place is much the same as Kermanshah, tho here there is a Jewish quarter, with better shops &amp; more up to date goods, which come via the Caspian.  Poverty and  starvation is just as rampant &amp; Stalky has people on the job of famine relief. One meal a day is given to the people on road work &amp; the surplus distributed to the people.  It is said that a particular party calling themselves Democrats are right up against us on a/c of saving the rabble, as they term these people from starvation.</p>
<p>May 21<br/>Paid a visit to the American Missionary quarter.  Dr. Funk &amp; his wife are apparently head of the show.  They live in a rather nice sort of bungalow</p>
