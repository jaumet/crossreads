 Juli 18th Have , I fear , neglect my diari a great deal . I had intend keep it most religi dure the trip , and am now a long way behind , so far , inde that I wonder if I will be abl to pick it up . After all , everi day entri would , I fear becom veri monoton , as the daili round on board ship is much the same . The monotoni of the ship , the lack of everi day regular employ would at first sight seem conduc to effort in this direct , if onli to fill in time , and yet such is the pervers of human natur , that the veri unemploy which is so gall , seem to take away from one the desir to work , and the lazi feel grow apac . The journey to Colombo has been unev , as inde , has been each day so far sinc leav Australia . We have drift into the tropic now and into tropic weather , and the troop deck are anyth but pleasant place these time . Fli fish etc . 29th Juli Was on deck this morn befor the star began to pale , watch the light of Colombo in the distanc , wonder just what kind of new world was to bring .
