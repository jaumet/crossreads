<p>money  <strike>of</strike> over here while on furlough as I had about &pound;35 to draw.  I have a month's furlough   &amp; have about &pound;5 on my book to draw now.  I hope you are all O.K at home.  I have not had any letters for about a month or so. I suppose you got my letters. I write about once a fortnight or three weeks but of course sometimes to  [indecipherable]  or Brisbane.<br/>There are 250 men leaving for Australia to-day and also about 300 for Egypt, but I will be here some time yet I am afraid.<br/>With love to all from<br/>Your affectionate Son<br/>Charlie</p>
