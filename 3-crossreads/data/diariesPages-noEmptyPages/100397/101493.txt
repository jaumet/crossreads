left France again in Dec. only very slightly wounded in the wrist.. he was lucky. I suppose when I go back there will be some of the Tanks working with us. I want to see them at work So far I have not seen any at all though they are at Bovington.. they came there after we left for this camp. I am enclosing a couple of Photos with this Some say they are good, others say I look too stern. I am sending some more by Registered Post. and will send Instructions with them.. I had them taken at Croydon near Wallington. I am also enclosing the photo of the "Gee" family with whom I stopped when up at Liverpool, they gave me two Photos and I am keeping one. I have not heard anything of Simmons since I left the Battn. I wrote to Horseferry Road and I also wrote to S. but have not heard yet he may still be allright a lot of the 2nd Boys are here now a very large percentage were very slightly wounded. S. was with the Lewis Machine Guns. and
