<p>We formed up on the parade ground in the morning and were inspected; then marched to the Station where most of us took the train to London.</p>
<p>When I got to London I got a good glimpse of it by getting on different trams and going circular trips. The same evening I took a train from London and travelled to Woking, (the chief town of Surrey) where an aunt lived and spent the remainder of my leave there. I had a very good time at Woking and went several long bicycle rides into the neighbouring country, visiting one place of particular interest, Guildford Castle. On the two evenings I spent at Woking I went roller skating, and had an enjoyable time. The evening my leave expired my cousins came to the Railway station to see me off, and wished me good luck for the last time. I arrived back at camp at midnight and felt very sorry to think I had to settle down to camp life again after having had such an interesting and enjoyable holiday. Some of the men gave way to temptation of taking extra leave, and of course, they were duly punished for doing so.</p>
<p>We had now been on the Plains about 10 weeks, and were informed that we were to go to France in two Weeks time, and from this on we were doing extra hard training to prepare for our harder life. We did bayonet exercises and bombing practice for hours at a time, and took a keen interest in it all, as we knew at this stage the better knowledge we possessed, the better we would fare if circumstances warranted good hand to hand fighting  when we were in the trenches. The training system was perfect, as it was divided into groups, each group having a special instructor from the best military schools in England. In the Bayonet practice we used to have suspended dummies with the vital spots of a man's body marked on them. At these marks we would have to thrust the bayonet in any particular method the instructor required of us. <br/>In the bombing classes we would be shown how to take the bomb to pieces safely and how to test it. We were also instructed in the mechanism appertaining to the detonating of the bomb, so that we thoroughly understood what we were handling, and how to use a bomb with best results. There is a good deal of skill in throwing a bomb effectively as the fuses are timed for a couple of seconds in some cases</p>
