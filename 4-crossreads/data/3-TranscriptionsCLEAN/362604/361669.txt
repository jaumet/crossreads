  
 Well, Mum Dear, I wrote to you on Wednesday & except for receiving 8 letters from Australia (3 from Home) nothing has happened at all.  Oh! I played Cricket against a Tommy team yesterday.  We won by 26 runs of which total, mine quota was 9. 
 Best Love to you all at Home.  Kindest Regards to Mrs. Stephen, Bunting, Doyle, Parkes & Mrs. Keirle also to my other Manly Friends. 
 Best Love From Harry
