<p>Remember me to all the Tunneys when you see them, also Birt and his wife,</p>
<p>I am writing this letter in the Y.M.C.A. Hut. If it was not for the Y.M.C.A. the soldiers lives would not be so cheerfull, they are deserving of every ones help, as they are in every place you go. They supply all writing paper and envelopes free.</p>
<p>I heard the finest sermon preached yesterday morning by Captain OHalloran I ever heard and I can tell you there was not to many dries eyes in the crowd when he had finished. He will touch a man if there is any good in him at all. When they pray for the Absent ones at home, I can tell you it makes one think of all we have left.</p>
<p>I will be pleased to get a letter saying that you have got some of mine. I think we must of got our first letters about the same time as you get ours as we landed here on the 5th April and got our letters on 10th of April. I have taking a dose of En&oacute;s Fruit Salts nearly every day since leaving the West. I have used <strike>fife</strike> five bottles.</p>
<p>No more news for this time. Remember me to all old friends. Kind Regards and best wishes to the Boss. I conclude with sending you heaps of love and my best wishes for yourself, I always pray for God to Bless and keep You and Nell and Baby safe. Good Bye for the present</p>
<p>I remain your ever loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>[Text at top of page]<br/>Take care of Nell and Baby for me till I return also take every care of yourself and do not worry about me. As What is to be Will Be.<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>Tons of Kisses for you<br/>X X X X X X X<br/>X X X X X X X<br/>X X<br/>X X X X X X X</p>
