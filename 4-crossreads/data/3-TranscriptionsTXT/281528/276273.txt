 2/4/18 &ndash; Shank Hill Camp fell in and moved down to embus in a column of busses.  We paid today and consequently there were a few drunks about the place.  The men were looking tired but clean.  We marched through the ruined village of Neuve Eglise.  Passed long columns of English reinforcements &ndash; in many cases under Australian officers.  Many were children of the 18 class and were straggling all over the road.  A great exhibition of disorganization.  We put 25 men into each bus in the column &amp; then set off.  The road lay through Locre, Dranoutre and right back to near Mont des Cats.
