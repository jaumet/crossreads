<p>Dear Father<br/>Now that a favourable opportunity has occurred  I will be able to let you know again how I have been passing the time for the last month or two. We are again back in rest billets behind the line after having spent nearly a month up in the trenches and I am glad to say I feel very little the worse for it. Of course the worst we have to contend with are the weather conditions which have been fairly severe of late, but apart from a very slight touch of swollen feet, owing to the cold I managed all right. It was a great thing to get out for Xmas. I thought that we would have had to spend it up the line</p>
