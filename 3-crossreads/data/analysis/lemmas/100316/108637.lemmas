The hous we are lodg out at look from the street just the same as ani other typic villag hous but evid the peopl have been person of some import for the hous is comfort ? almost luxuri ? furnish . Whi the peopl do not shift their belong is hard to say . Onli five or six short kilometr away is abund evid of what will in time happen to this place too . Warloy was one of the most delight situat villag in the Somm . No mention of it would be complet without recal " The Bell of Warloy " who was far better known on the Somm than ani other woman on the British front . Her scarlet stock , her afternoon teaparti and the crowd of visitor made her veri well known . Entertain of platoon " the flag day " were known to all the Armi in these part . This morn the villag street are full of troop . Such a mixtur of unit of our Forc and thenTommi as well . Transport pass and repass . All night long there was in the street the sound of tramp feet as troop march in from the trench . A steadi muffl tramp that recal the same sound heard in mani place in three year past . In Egyptian street in old red Flander and Picardi villag . A chang and endless flow on the highway of Death . It never ceas .
