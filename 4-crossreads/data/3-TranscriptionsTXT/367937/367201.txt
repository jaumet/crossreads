Bill Graham is over here now: came in the 16th Reinfs. but Jack Dawson also Bartrim has gone out to the desert on infantry work; was sent out while I was away.  I did not miss anything while I was away as the chaps spent the whole of the time in Isolation and we all came back here to "details" at the same time.We have all got horses allotted to us (will send you a photo of mine) and will get plenty of work; but it is not very hard.Revallie goes at 4 AM and from then till 8 o'clock we have mounted training and feeding & watering horses, 10 to 12 we attend to horses & then from  4.30 till dark we get more training - so you can see most of the work is in the cool.It is very hot in the middle of the day but the nights are generally pretty cold.We have to ride about a mile and a half to the canal to water the horses and they have to go three times a day so it takes a good time.On getting back to the camp from Ras-el-tin who should I meet straight off but Charlie Rayment and Ted Elliot from Nyngan and then to get back with all the other chaps was great luck I thought.I meet Jack Glennie also, of course he is in the regt. but has been in hospital and was then sent here; he took my horse to water for me one time, but we did not know each other then however in theover
