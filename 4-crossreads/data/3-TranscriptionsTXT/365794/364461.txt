 Thursday 28th March 1917 [28th February 1918] Bright sunny day after all the wind &amp; storms of the last week.  Lovely tinted sunrises &amp; sunsets.  Storms today among the English sisters re a S. Reid who quarrels wherever she goes &ndash; I am only glad have not yet met her. Sisters come "on the strength" for a week or so &amp; then drift away up the line or exchange places with others at different hospitals.
