<p>Saturday 3 November 1917<br/>A week since we landed &amp; not one moment on duty for me.  Still things are more hopeful &amp; temp. normal all day and no more rises.<br/>Feel very "done" if attempt any movements.  Cobbie comes &amp; takes away my gown dressing to wash, how a kindly little act stands out here.  My n. nurse goes &amp; is replaced by Miss Reid (Scotch) &amp; gets into trouble all night with the others.</p>
