<p>Dear George, I will have to answer your letter by the next mail too. This is the little old Church that we visited. It is built in the form of a + [cross]. I wrote all about in a previous letter. We are both well &amp; doing OK. Give our regards to all the Boys &amp; to Mr Love too. We do not forget Him or any of the Boys. Now I must have my supper &amp; go to bed. My 3 easy days are today Saturday &amp; Sunday so this is Thursday night &amp; I feel alright. Now, look after yourselves &amp; we hope to hear that you all sleep well &amp; happy. Love Harry</p>
