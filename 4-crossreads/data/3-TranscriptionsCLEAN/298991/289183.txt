Sunday June 24thDraft left at 7 am this morning, I felt like falling in & going with them, but it only lasted a little while. Just at the time the roll was called. Put on cleaning up the mess the draft left, I had to help clean up No 5 hut. There are only about forty left in camp now. Shifted from No 6 hut to No 17. Owing to nobody being left after all the fatigues being detailed, there was no church parade for us. Very monotonous this afternoon. Bridge is a favourite game in camp here.
Monday June 25thCamp is very quiet. Had a tooth filled & another pulled this afternoon. I felt no pain while the dentist was pulling it, but from half an hour afterwards it was very sore. Very monotonous in the evening. Word came through that all mail to Egypt & Australia between the date of 13 to 23rd May has been sunk. I do not think I had sent any mail about that time.
Tuesday June 26thA lovely day. Put on Quartermasters fatigue this morning, it only lasted half an hour, & is considered the best job in the camp. Had nothing to do at all this afternoon, so we have had a very easy day of it. The food we get here is absolutely splendid & well cooked.
