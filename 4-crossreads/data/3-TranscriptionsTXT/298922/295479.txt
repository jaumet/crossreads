Now that stirrups IRONS & BITS have to be brightened, it is no easy job after 3 years of rusting. However the boys rose to the occasion & found that the SODA Tablets issued to CHLORINATE the drinking water were excellent, the M.O. wonders at the demand!! so suddenly. As a rule the men drink the first water they find if dry & worry not about germs.
It is an exploded idea the deadliness of SCORPIONS, men get bitten almost daily & beyond a big swelling for the whole of the time & a sick feeling, they carry on - not pleasant I'll admit but we thought at first would be more serious.
