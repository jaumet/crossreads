<p>Sunday 12 September, 1915</p>
<p>Had a shave, made a great find in the shape of a pair of socks, I only had those I stood up in before.</p>
<p>Scored another tin of milk &amp; had some more rice &amp; milk. Mac had some &amp; reckoned it was all right.</p>
<p>The weather is cold &amp; dull, would not be surprised to see some rain.</p>
<p>Mac had a &quot;chat&quot; hunt &amp; got 13, he expects to have a comfortable nights sleep tonight.</p>
<p>Very light shower of rain during the night. Heavy bombardment by the fleet on the right.</p>
<p>Wrote to Mrs Ray, Mr Maquire &amp; Mr Chauvel.</p>
