<p>Dear Mother and Father<br/>I am now going to try and answer a few things in your letters which I have noted down.<br/>I always like to get the little cuttings in your letters. I particularly like the ones about the medical students; the firemen rescuing Tibbles and the man whose bandages had slipped.</p>
<p>I received the copies of Col. And Mrs Cuncliffe's letters. They are charming people and those were the sort of letters I would expect from them. I have received two tins of Watson B lately. It is strange but that seems to be the one thing which does not reach me.<br/>I got a letter from Doone and wrote to him in reply.<br/>I received a letter from Bowman about the spring cart and the pigs. It was lovely and typical of dear Kenneth.<br/>I again wrote to Savigny describing my trip to Oxford. No letter from him yet.<br/>I received Balaclava from Gertrude's daughter, Have not yet written to her.<br/>Am glad Verlie is fixed up and that Mr Ohleson  is looking fit.<br/>Phyllis is in excellent health and getting a furry coat again. She always noses round my pockets for sugar now and is rather a nuisance.<br/>Glad to hear Twinnie has been doing her duty to her king and country again. She also seems to be a source of revenue to her boss.<br/>I received kneecaps and mittens from Clarke. Shall write to him later.<br/>Am sending a couple of stars along &ndash; to-morrow.<br/>thats about all the notes</p>
<p>.m in a delightfully comfy little hut in a good camp for a few days.<br/>Am very busy with Court Martials.<br/>Am quite fit.<br/>Best love<br/>Your affec. Son<br/>C.R.Lucas</p>
