<p>Tuesday&nbsp;15 May 1917.</p>
<p>A little more recovered from the sea sickness &amp; feeling hungry. Went up on deck at 6.30&nbsp;am&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather a rough day today.</p>
<p>Boat drill during morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our boat right close to the &quot;Encounter&quot; &amp; near the lead.</p>
<p>In the bight now. Back at Mess Orderly duties again with G.S.S.C. (who has acted&nbsp;<u>a dinkum cobber&nbsp;</u>to me while crook with seasickness.)<br />[George Stuart Strathdee Cameron, No 16923, Camel Field Ambulance sailed on the Boorara with Culbert Cecil Fisher.]</p>
<p>Towards afternoon sea rougher</p>
<p>Ran into a storm later &amp; at night it is bitterly cold up on deck. &nbsp;Band playing down on No 4 deck cheering things up.</p>
<p>Everybody brighter today. Feeling better. Wrote 6 cards afternoon.</p>
<p>(Lost one of E M (?) mittens)</p>
<p>Are now well down in Sthn<sup> &nbsp;</sup>Ocean</p>
