  
 March, 1916 Friday 24 Exam stoppages this morning. I was lucky to draw blank & have no class to examine. My boys do fairly good.  results of paper come out & are a great shock  marks very low. I have 4 specials 
 Saturday 25 Parade at 8.30 am to receive certificates. At 10 am the first parties to leave march out & continue until only a few men are left who are to leave tomorrow
