I went over to Heliopolis one evening. a swell little town not far from camp. mostly french people there, the streets are named in unpronounceable french Egyptian some of the buildings are very fine especially one built for a hotel but at present used as a military hospital. it is a tremendous building. I heard it has over 1000 rooms, but you can't believe all you hear out in this place where all men are liars, especially our crowd. there is also a lunar park like in Melbourne the white city in Sydney. a place where joy rides, etc are all the go, a chap spends 100 piastres before he knows it. We only stayed at Abassia a week then had to march out here about 14 miles where we have joined our respective. Battn. there are of course a good many men not on the strength, (I don't know whether I am or not.) but we will all be used up in time, so as reinforcements our career is over. for which I am glad.
