<p>Len tells me this morning that his groin is getting sore again &amp; that he is going to see the Dr. in a couple of days.</p>
<p>26th.  Last night was a stormy one &amp; the wind howled &amp; raged like fury &amp; now &amp; again heavy storms of rain would come down, but luckily we are camped on sandy ground &amp; that saved us from being flooded out though we had gutters dug round our tent. Heavy firing could be heard yesterday evening I think it was Verdun way for it was East from here.</p>
<p>27th. Sunday round once more &amp; we are still here &amp; kicking our heels with impatience at being</p>
