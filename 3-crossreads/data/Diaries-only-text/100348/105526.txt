Another sultry day, the sea is oily calm and the ship is making good time. We cannot be far from the "line" now. Met Viv Haswell today had a long yarn with him.

I was picked for guard again today but managed to get out of it. Never did a tap all day. Saw a real tropical shower this afternoon, the scuppers ran with water. There was another issue of Cigarettes, etc
1st February. 1916.
The company tried to do bayonet fighting, but 9/10ths of ?em were over with sea sickness or laziness, all the afternoon. A great concert was held by the passengers. The show was a good one, for there were one or two professional performers.
