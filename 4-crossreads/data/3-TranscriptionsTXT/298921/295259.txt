 October, 1915 Friday 15 Went for a ride to No 1 Hospital to test my thigh, it didn't break out so interviewed AAG &amp; was lucky enough to get my name down to 9 with the next lot of reinforcements to Anzac leaving about 20th Nov. Saw Mardi for a few minutes she looked very professional in Uniform &ndash; &amp; is well. My first night out of a comfortable bed did not sleep, heard the Picquet changing, &amp; every horse that broke loose, but will soon get accustomed again &amp; this is Paradise compared to the Peninsular but the flies &amp; dust are still bad here in Camp &amp; the  Bugs  are in the matting I bought.
