<p>at 2 am.</p>
<p>9.9.18<br/>Fine weather prevailed the weather being extreemly hot &amp; muggy. Reports by wireless of submarines about but none sighted. At 10 pm we were 2 miles behind the convoy. The guide morsed &amp; complained bitterly so put up extra speed &amp; took up our proper position.</p>
<p>10.9.18<br/>Our speed reduced this day to 13 knots, zig zagging throughout. Signals from the guide complaining of our transport being not in stations the reason I shall not mention here &amp; exposing ourselves in the event of a submarine attack.<br/>Two military captains volunteered to trim coal during the night in the bunkers. The went down &amp; worked hard &amp; I spoke to them next morning. They had a great experience but owing to the work being hard &amp; unacustomed to it were completely knocked out &amp; hands blistered.<br/>Concert held this night which proved a great success</p>
