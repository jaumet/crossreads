<p>Real quagmire, accommodation rotten. This billet was vacated by the 9th Battery. Weather wet and cold. Wet boots and feet day after day, and to make matters worse, a Divisional order is out, calling in every blanket with the exception of 1 per man. This taking place tomorrow. This order was cancelled later. Out of action for 2 weeks. The total number of rounds fired by the Bty in last position was, 4,090 Not bad for one month. Col Anderson on leave to England. Daylight saving, come into operation last night. Time put forward one hour. Again the Battery was complimented for the good work done in action, by the General. We battered the German trenches to pieces and altered their line, they even rushed reinforcements up. No casualties in Bty. Put in a bad night, sleeping on a brick floor, with 2 blankets. Tonight I changed my billet. Our horses are not doing too</p>
