 a short route march returning to the ship at 11 a.m. 
 At mid-day the &quot;Rio Pardo&quot; is towed into &quot;Table Bay&quot;, and then we commence in earnest the last stage of our voyage to Australia.&nbsp; Table Mountain &amp; Lion&#39;s Head seen for the last time as our vessel draws away from land are indelibly printed in my mind. 
 Farewell &quot;S.A.&quot;!
