Aeroplane Contact Signalling

The 34th Flying Squadron is attached to the Anzac Army Corps & consists of 4 Contact planes which are marked with 2 black strokes on both bottom wings front to rear & also two blue streamers from the uprights under top wings. The machines are of B.E.2. type & there are not many of them.
