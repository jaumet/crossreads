  
 [Methodist Soldiers' Tent letterhead] now & then to pump the back tyre up.  I got across to the City alright & pumped the tyre up again which lasted me till I reached the G.P.O. when I had to do it again.  By these stages I arrived at Ol's via Crown & Cleveland Sts.  I was glad enough to reach Dowling St, too for I was beginning to be tired.  I found Ol's phone out of Order, so went up to Crown & Oxford Sts. Post Office & rang up.  I also got 3 Census Cards for Ol & Emily & myself, but we soldiers don't have to fill them in do we Father, I have asked a number here & they say that the soldiers don't have to fill them in. I caught the 8.30 from Sydney & arrived here in nice time to go on duty at 10.  I was very sleepy & tired when 6 o'clock came but as soon as the 6.45 parade was over, I went over to the Orderly Room to report myself, but neither of the 2 men were in.  After breakfast I went to bed & slept right through till 5.30 to-night.  Then came tea, & I went over again to the Orderly Room but neither of them were in.  I found my blankets & port where I had left them, fortunately for me.
