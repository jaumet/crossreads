<p>3/9/15  Lemnos<br/>sheltered coves by projecting capes.  About 15 fathoms of water furnished anchorage for scores of transports.  Coming up to our moorings we passed through two lines of warships &ndash; one side French the other British.  Scattered camps fleck the hillsides and one village nestles among trees.  Exquisite shades of green on the hills and right down to the water's edge.  Dancing seas and bright sunlight complete a pleasant picture.  And yet at 9 am war's presence came home to us by the sinking of our comrades on the "Southland".  I hope to God Jack is on the "Haverford".  At 4 pm Embarkation officer says "Southland has not been sunk.  Only 2 boatloads of men lost.  She is coming in under her own steam!"  Frantic cheers.</p>
<p>6 pm<br/>Torpedo boat destroyer passed.  She was full of 21st men.  Said to be hit 2 feet below waterline.  After dark the roar of guns from Gallipoli can be heard.</p>
