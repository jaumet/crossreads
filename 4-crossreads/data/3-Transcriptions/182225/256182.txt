<p>Fine, came on to rain in evening Rode round Piccadilly with father in morning and Joan &amp; Linda &amp; I went up to Ben Ledi after we had a look at our names carved on the tree in Ben Ledi Father, Joan, Linda &amp; Self left in Lawrence&#39;s car for Quirindi at 1.20 pm &amp; got into Quirindi about 3 oclock. Father went back about 5 oclock &amp; we had dinner at Fogarty&#39;s &amp; Eric Cadell came &amp; had it with us. Lay on the verandah till the train went Bill Storey was with us. Got berths in 11.30 &amp; had a good trip down. Cant realise yet that I have left home for a long time &amp; that it may be years before I see the place again. Father did not like going home by himself a bit to an empty house. Think the trip did Linda a great lot of good, but wish we had struck cool weather</p>
