Ribemont 
22/1/17 Signs of a thaw which disappeared when some light snow fell. Parade at 9.30 marched out past German prisoners camp to a small paddock all frozen and white. Turnout still bad, unshaven and dirty men but all worked like bees with knife and brush getting mud out. Inspected a few platoons and went in early leaving Pedler to march the show back to Camp. After lunch repeated the performance and found them all correct or much improved. Left early to see Brigadier and got details for tomorrows inspection. At 4.30 let all orderly room cases off with a caution not having the heart to push it into them they looked so clean!. (Failing to shave was the charge). All officers came in then and we pow-wowed re inspection and other regimental matters. Talking to madam she volunteered much information about naughty girls both in Amiens and here. Doctor saw in a shop tonight a woman with the Crown of Venus on her forehead. 40 men on Amiens leave today.
