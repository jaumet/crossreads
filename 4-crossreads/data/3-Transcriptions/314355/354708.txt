<p>April 1<br/>28.<br/>Turning in, still at La Clytte:  'De Zon' Camp emptied of its men, and all A Sect. there now at Reninghelst.  Several shells have passed over us here &ndash; and seemingly landed at R.</p>
<p>Aerial activity this morning.  Boche planes over, and one chased to earth by Vllamertinghe [Vlamertinghe].</p>
<p>This afternoon to Gottesveldt [Godewaersvelde] &ndash; to 11th C.C.S., back through Mt des Catz [Mont des Cats], Mt Deveden, and home.</p>
<p>Padre O'Brien returned "Vengeance of Fionn".  He's a fine type of man, richly tolerant and popular all round:  he's the one Padre I would enjoy a confiding with:  he is well read, a poet, and the ideal R.C. and his manner is charming.</p>
<p>T.L.S. a quite interesting issue.</p>
<p>Oh for the hot sun and the golden days, today's been warmer than usual, the sky a milky tourquoise, well clouded about the horizons.  But I long for the days that burn brown the face and hands ,strike>that</strike> and the nervy knees, for the old Henencourt days of training when the beauty of our chaps was one with the colour of the days, and their marching to a high and [indecipherable] band more splendid than life.</p>
<p>April 2<br/>29.<br/>10 a.m.  No word of our handing over M.D.S., probability of our holding here for few days, before leaving for the South, rumour strangely silent as to our destination.  Arras? or Nieuport?</p>
<p>Writing a slow letter to Mother, nothing seems to provide news, started to write of the R.C. Padre, Father O'Brien and half commenced a censoring of the general Padre, but even if Mother would understand my attitude its not worth while.</p>
<p>Perhaps the three Padres dodging about the Resuscitation Tent at Dickebusch were exceptions but they were "bloody nuisances".</p>
<p>Write to T.B.C. for Moore's "Story Tellers Holiday" and after a deal of thought, for Stephen's "Crock of Gold".</p>
<p>30.<br/>Turning in, move tomorrow from here at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>The Seaforths and Camerons have arrived from the Somme.  During the afternoon Dick H. and self to the Y.M. and a meeting them there, and a long listening to their yarning and telling as only the Jock can tell, tales of retreats and stands, tales told in splendid rapid phrases, brilliantly impressionistic.</p>
<p>Tonight with Eric G. a yarning with two</p>
