  
 the sniper got me, hit me a clean knock out in the chest, a nice clean little hole in front & a great big one where it came out behind, bleeding like a pump at every breath.  I had to lay still for a couple of mins., then they got my equipment & clothing off & found the bullet had entered my left breast & come out at the back, the exit hole was bleeding profusely but they did their best to staunch it, gave me a drink & one of them went for the Stretcher Bearers.  After some trouble he found a party & brought them along.  They bandaged me more carefully & put me on the stretcher.  From then on for about an hour & a half
