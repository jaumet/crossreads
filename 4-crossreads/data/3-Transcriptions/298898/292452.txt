<p>Tuesday 13th Feb.<br/>Now over two years since I sailed from Sydney in the old "Seang Choon" for active service and still the end is not in sight, however we know we cannot lose now so all will yet be well. Am sure the time has dragged with those at home, they have not had the variety of scenes &amp; incidents to encounter that I have. Through it all I have only had the one sickness so must consider myself very fortunate. Had a jaunt on the Major's mount. First went to Heilly &amp; watched the horses while the others had a bath &amp; then rode on to 'Corbie' where we had tea, 6 eggs being the chief item riding back just on dusk. A most enjoyable time altogether &amp; did not feel cold altho' snow covered the whole landscape. The thaw appears to have set in at last the temp. being much higher altho' actually it feels just as cold as before.</p>
