<p>Dear Mum, Dad &amp; George,<br/>I am again on my way to War &amp; I am sitting in the Park opposite the museum at the back of St George's Hall writing this. I had a nice journey across with two Liverpool  Jack Tars, a Scot, A Kent man and Irishman &amp; a Belgian who spoke no English. I was able to converse a little in Pigeon French &amp; he was quite at home &amp; very pleased. I had a good nights sleep &amp; Breakfast &amp; as it is a calm day I expect to have a fair crossing. Anyway it can't possibly be worse that last time &amp; I saw that out very well for such a bad sailor. I am all alone but I am quite Happy. I make Pals with anyone &amp; never go lonely very long. Liverpool is quite a busy place &amp; the Lancashire lassies are very nice. They are walking to work now as it is just after 9 am.  Love from Harry</p>
