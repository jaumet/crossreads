Dear Mr Minister
Re Lieutenant K. A. Ferguson
Following up my letter of the 27th instant, I enclose you a letter I have received from young Ferguson, together with a copy of my reply, which speak for themselves.  You will see what a jolly good chap he is.
Kindly thoughts
Truly yours
Robt. McC. Anderson
