<p>I have had a very busy day &amp; I have to shave, tidy up &amp; pack my bags before I go to bed so as the only news to give you has been given.  I'll say Good-night.</p>
<p>I am quite happy &amp; the weather is lovely now.  English Spring is wonderful &amp; glorious</p>
<p>Love to you all<br/>From Harry</p>
