RED CROSS & Y.M.C.A.
A PROTEST.
To Editor "Egyptian Gazette."
Sir, - As an Australian woman, lately arrived from the States, I was surprised to learn from your columns of Saturday's issue, that Lieutenant Colonel Barrett had given 500, on account of the Australian Red Cross towards the erection of the Y.M.C.A. Headquarters at Alexandria.
While being absolutely in sympathy with, & having a profound admiration for the work of this splendid organisation, it seems to me that at the present juncture, this money is urgently needed to procure comforts for our sick & wounded. I know from personal knowledge, there are many women, of small means, in Australia, denying themselves in order to assist through Red Cross "our boys" who are suffering in this land. As a daily visitor to the hospitals, I know much more of this money might be spent on extras for their comfort & pleasure, & I feel I am voicing the feelings of many sisters in the Homeland by entering this protest.
Yours, etc.,An Australian Woman.
Cairo, July 6.
