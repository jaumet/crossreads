<p>After leaving Baubuerre the road is very heavy all the way to Bruay, I made a good run to Colon where the Branch line rejoins the Main line from St Pol to Chocques, my R.O.D. banker left me at Colon &amp; a French Engine took its' place, &amp; off we went again, as it was very dark I had to go along cautiously still climbing, we left the main line at [blank] &amp; turned on to a Single line towards Houdain &amp; on to Bruay, the line from Houdain to Bruay being very heavy, especially coming into Bruay Station, I was stopped half way into the Station by the Signal Man were my French Bank Engine left me &amp; in a few moments was called ahead, but it was impossible to lift the load, &amp; the French Men could not understand me &amp; me them, so we all were in a quandery, anyhow as we had 15 trucks off for Bruay, they were uncoupled &amp; put in the Siding. Then I lifted my load &amp; after a good delay, off again we went <strike>node</strike> now</p>
