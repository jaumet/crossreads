<p>6-4-17<br/>crops are all in head, but very low, but good feed for the horses the barley is sown in patches on the desert &amp; no fences &amp; we go over it as though it was not there. We arrived at Sheikh Towaid well before sundown &amp; it seems strange to see the train constantly running backwards &amp; forwards, when 8 weeks ago there was nothing but Bedouins here. It did not take so long to get the horses watered &amp; our lines down &amp; some of the lads went to the canteen &frac12; a mile away &amp; got some fruit Etc so we are set up for the trek tomorrow. The Sig troop have to find piquet for Headquarters tonight</p>
