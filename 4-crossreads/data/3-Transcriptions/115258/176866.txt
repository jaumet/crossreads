<p>23rd June 1918</p>
<p>Mr dear Fred</p>
<p>I&#39;m afraid I have left it a bit late but this letter is to wish you many happy returnes of your birthday, and if the cake has not all been eaten please have another slice for me. I had to look at the watch to know what date to put on this letter, but it is the 23rd because its just a quarter after midnight. Afternoon. The mosquitoes hunted me away from the candle there, so I left this and went and sat in the moonlight where it was cooler. We are still just stopping here, not doing &#39;nuffink&#39; so there is not much news to tell you. I walked round to Hqrs this morning and found a P.F.A. magazine waiting for me there but the Pastoral Review, which Mother said she posted the same day did not arrive and I was disappointed as it is the one <s>I</s>&nbsp;with the photographs of home in it. However in the past I have always lent my Review to Major Weir each month and he told me the other day that he was expecting one himself this mail so I&#39;ll go over and see him in a day</p>
