<p>a periscope &amp; with my head over the top.  A bare 200 yds separated them from us, it being a wonderful thing that for over two years the two lines have sat &amp; watched each other across a narrow strip of neutral land.  The country itself at the trenches is of course all neglected except for saps which lead everywhere.  The front line itself appears to be a disorderly heap of sandbags bleached white by the weather.  At one spot we hold part of a large convent the remainder being in the hands of the Germans, nothing remaining now of course bar bricks &amp; ruins.  Fleur Baix just behind the lines is shelled regularly but still holds a few people.  A telegraph post there has a hole drilled right through it by a shell fragment.  Estaminets have all been closed in this area for some reason not quite clear.  Diphtheria being about is given as one reason, the need of our move being kept quiet being another.  We are moving at last today being spent packing up.  The Somme possibly is our destination but 'tis not known for sure</p>
