us to afternoon tea. Thursday July 19th wet. The bridge in the town is called Anzac Bridge because every afternoon it is never known to be without Australian soldiers sitting on it. Friday fine, went down town. Saturday July 21st Crayford Carnivol procession passed through Dartford, it was a very good turn-out, some very good characters.
