<p>was being sent to Australia for discharge He eluded them somehow and months afterwards he turned up again on the peninsular. When half the regiment went away to Lemnos Island for a spell on the 12th November 5 weeks before the final evacuation he went and reported sick and again passed a medical board for Australia. The next news of him was that he was employed as a chief fumigator in one of the big hospitals on Lemnos Island. The next chapter is where he turns up unexpectedly at Heliopolis Camp after we had gone way. The next chapter sees him transferred to the Artillery and after that he gets sent to France and the last chapter up to date is that he has been in action in France and has been wounded.</p>
