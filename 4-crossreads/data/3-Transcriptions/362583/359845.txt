<p>1st. January 1915</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>Here I am in Launceston after having spent a whole night in the train with a full grown man, &amp; I have <u>not</u> had my money stolen. After breakfast I will go to the building right opposite the G.P.O., where ever that is, &amp; find out what there is to find out. I think I will probably be going up to the Power Station this morning.</p>
<p>As the breakfast bell has just gone, &amp; a feeling has come over me that I wouldn't be any the worse for a little nourishment, I will have to say good-bye.</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Arthur.</p>
