<p>a communication trench all day &amp; a dug out for a cobber &amp; myself.  Relieved men in the firing line at night &amp; stayed there till 8 a.m. next morning.  During night Turks played our bugle calls &amp; advanced with cries of 'Allah' .  We heard we did much slaughter.  I was alongside one of our guns &amp; when it went off it <strike>through</strike> threw earth all over us &amp; nearly deafened us.  I thought at first a shell had dropped in front of us.</p>
