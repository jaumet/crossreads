<p>quite a number present.  The time is changed, 6.30 a.m. instead of 6 a.m., so more are able to get there.</p>
<p>The evening service is at 6.15 p.m. so unless we are <u>off-duty</u> we cannot attend but I believe there was a great number last Sunday night.</p>
<p>So glad that dear old Flo. had such a nice happy wedding.  I do hope Archie will not have to leave too soon for the front.  I do hope they both will be spared to have a very, very, happy &amp; long live together.</p>
<p>I've got a bit of news to tell you, Dorothy has broken off her engagement with Mr. Grylls, which I'm jolly glad is at an end.  He was not the man I should think any girl like Dorothy should wed.  Her people no doubt will be astonished but she was quite unhappy over the whole business.  She is just her bright old self again.  All her friends here who knew them both are very pleased to hear it is at an end.  Don't say anything about this "There is another attraction"</p>
