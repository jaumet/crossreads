Dolphin Hotel & we report back & go on board our ship "[Nopatin]" a Yankee boat about 50 ft out of water & drawing 15 ft. built for coastal trade & unable to face heavy weather
The whole superstructure has been strutted to save her falling to pieces on the way across & some passages are impassable owing to struts & in all the top cabins a beam prevents the door being closed. All water & basins have been taken out of cabins owing to their ill use by officers. One & only latrine we can find open has 3 ins of water on floor & is still rising. Soon some one may be interested enough to stop it but at present none of the Yankees seem to care. Blankets are on issue but no one can find that particular officer & the crew are not obliging & will not look for any one for you. The Yank with an eye to business retails coffee & a slice of bread for 1/- to us.
We move off about 7 pm but wait down off the Admiralty as we must enter Havre on the high water. I meet two french hospital men & we yarn till late into the night till I turn in. The sea comes up rough & the tub does some pretty
