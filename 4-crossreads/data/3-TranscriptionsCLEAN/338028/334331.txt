Thursday 22nd JuneThe aeroplane was found about 12 miles from the 1st L.H. camp, it had descended owing to Engine trouble. A party of Turks are reported to be on the move nine miles from here.
Friday 23rd JuneOne of the hottest days I have experienced. The No 6th L.H. went out to Romani to-day and the N.Z.M.R. came in reported that we will be going for ours shortly. Great rumours floating about that there has been another big battle in the North Sea and that the Bedouins have forsaken the Turks owing to religious view.
Saturday 24th
There must be great news somewhere for everybody seems to be excited, all sorts of rumours are [indecipherable] as may be expected. To-day I invented a sanitation patens.
Sunday 25th JuneNothing doing, camp horribly monotonous. Official accounts published of El-Arish air raid. I am disgusted with the lies, it says we got eight enemy aeroplanes, when we know for a fact they only got four. This ridiculous blindfolding of news is ruining the Allies.
