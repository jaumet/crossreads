 So glad that dear old Flo. had such a nice happy wedding.  I do hope Archie will not have to leave too soon for the front.  I do hope they both will be spared to have a very, very, happy &amp; long live together. 
 I've got a bit of news to tell you, Dorothy has broken off her engagement with Mr. Grylls, which I'm jolly glad is at an end.  He was not the man I should think any girl like Dorothy should wed.
