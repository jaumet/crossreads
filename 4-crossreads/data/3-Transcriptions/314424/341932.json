We left Colombs at about 10 and travelled the usual route until we passed Lumbres when we took the main road to St Omer and camped for the night at an adjoining village St Martin au Laert arriving in good time at 3.30. I was brakeman for W.Kiley and rode by turns with him  This little village adjoins St Omer which we visited after tea and saw the church which is a very handsome cathedral both inside and out, also the french barracks now used by the British &amp; the town hall.</p>
