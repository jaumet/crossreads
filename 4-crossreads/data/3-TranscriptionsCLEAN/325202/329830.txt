on Tuesday evening reported to D.E. billetted in a brewery at at little village of Tilques about 5 miles from St Omer
Too late to get anything hot to eat or drink in the village & as we were cold & famished I told Bob to look after my horses & I would do some foraging. Appealed to a Mlle in the Brewery Yard about making us some hot coffee - She came back & said yes come into the house
So in a few minutes we entered the back & found the Mlle who turned out to be the servant - seated in the back living room with the Brewer & his wife who were just finishing
