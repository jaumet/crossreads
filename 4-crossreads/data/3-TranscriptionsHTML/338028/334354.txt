<p>Tuesday 12th Sept<br/>Rode to Serapeum to see dentist, had glorious swim in the canal, returned to do some dispensing. Great news on all fronts.</p>
<p>Wednesday 13th Sept<br/>Oh happy relief, I rec a letter from my brother Lionel in France, he read I had been killed in action, that is why he did not write. My other poor brother little Lolly boy has been wounded and is in London, progressing favourably, what a relief it was to me no one save a loving elder brother can know. I replied immediately.</p>
<p>Thursday 14th Sept<br/>My birthday, my third on active service, it was a happy one, as I had my load of worry lifted since I heard from my brothers.</p>
<p>In morn I rode to railhead, put Ziggy over jumps at Artillery riding school. Returned and had my health drunk at lunch time, all members of mess, cost me 106 piastres for the day.</p>
<p>I am now going to close my third diary down and send it home. This diary has seen me suffer sorrowfully and in after years I may read it as a chronicle of a fight with fate.</p>
