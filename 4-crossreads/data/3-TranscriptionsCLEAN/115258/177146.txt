it a little bit fuller when I get home. Well, we returned to the hotel for lunch, and found it consisted of eight courses, and jolly nice too; in fact we all agreed that if this was only lunch; well! Heaven help us when we started on dinner! At two o'clock our guide met us again, then time with a nice carriage and pair, and we drove about two miles down the river, along a beautiful road with trees each side to the stupendous ruins of Karnak which we had heard so much about. The first thing you see is Ptolomi's gate, which is some door way, believe me; the photo will describe it - then we went in to the avenue of sphinxes. This avenue stretched right to Luxor once, I believe, but only a few now remain. They are statues of a lions body with a rams head, although most of them have had their heads cut off and sent to different museums, but the it was wonderful to see the expression and intelegence in the faces that do remain, I'll bet the sculptor who made them, had had to mind a mob of roughish crossbreds when he was a little nipper back home on the farm. He knew all about the character of different sheep alright.
