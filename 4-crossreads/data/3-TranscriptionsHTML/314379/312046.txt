<p>Diary of events from the time we left <u>Liverpool</u> N.S.Wales to our arrival at <u>Devonport</u> <u>England</u><br/>From Oct 31st To Dec 25th 1918</p>
<p>We all arrived back at Liverpool about midnight previous to our first mornings commencement on this great adventure. Everything there was all hustle and bustle getting kits ect. Ready! And the air was full of suppressed excitement over the pending embarkation of the boys. We had plenty of fun one way and another, which included the pulling out of the whole of the troops who were remaining behind, to make sure that they would give us a good send off. Camp life at Liverpool, as far as we were concerned, was broken at 2.30 am and we formed up for the last time at the Army Service depot for the final roll call. The result of this showed that only two out of a total of 163 of us failed to face the music at the eventful muster, and this is a good record, especially as their absence may have been caused through circumstances beyond their control. However there were a dozen emergencies waiting, and it was the work of only a few minutes filling in the two vacancies. We then marched to the Parade Grounds and joined the other units who were to sail with us. After going through a few formalaties there, which took about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> hours, we started for Liverpool station headed by a band and cheered by the remaining soldiers. We eventually left for Sydney in the vicinity of 4.30 am &ndash; ours being the third train to leave. As the train moved off we took a farewell look at the huts ect. Which had been our home for varying periods. After anything but a comfortable train trip, we arrived at Sydney Railway Station in the wee small hours of the morning.<br/>Of course we did not have a wink of sleep the previous night and this fact was plainly written on every face as we lined up on the platform for the next stage of transit, a march to the boat. Thousands of people were waiting at the station to meet their soldier boys, and along the streets hundreds joined in. it was a memorable sight.</p>
