<p>Sunday May 27th<br/>2 June as<br/>(warm as Brisbane and the singlets' fine)</p>
<p>Somewhere in France<br/>Dear Mother",</p>
<p>Glorious France!</p>
<p>The last week has been absolutely boshter. [boshter, Australian slang, now obsolete, meaning 'excellent' or 'delightful']. Not everyone has the priviledge of leaving his camp in England with dozens of good friends wishing him good luck, jamming extra special brands in his pockets, tying a pair of baby's shoes with blue ribbon (for luck) on the back of his pack and promising everlasting friendship.</p>
<p>You should have heard the echo of the bones and tin whistle, the cheers and cooees as our company marched past the Bank</p>
