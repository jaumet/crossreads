<p>April 1918<br/>off duty &amp; I didn't go to work till Thursday.  Had a lot of work to do when I got back &amp; it took me a few days to make up the arrears of work.  On Saturday several of us went out to Mrs Clark's at Maadi &amp; had tea I heard her husband is an officer on the intelligence staff &amp; they have a nice garden home at Maadi near where our old camp used to be.  On Sunday morning we went to the Symphony Concert at the Kursaal, it was splendid.  There was a good orchestra of 50 players &amp; it is quite the best music I have listened to here yet.  These concerts are very popular &amp; are much appreciated</p>
