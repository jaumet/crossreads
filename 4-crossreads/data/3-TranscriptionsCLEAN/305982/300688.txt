  
 Hellish close again last night. Co for duty to day  Late last night, 2 Platoon on fatigue did not return till 21.30. Plenty of fatigues to day. Hot is not the word for the weather here it is even hotter than yesterday men very sluggish.  Plenty of beer drunk I can swear even in our Sgt mess they are doing nothing but bend the elbow. Our platoon out for early morning Parade also the 9.30 Parade no Parade this afternoon as we are going out 19.00 for a few hours for a change (an attack) water very short today half a bottle per man. mind we are getting tea three times a day grand meal on this evening  Roast meat boiled spuds cabbage I received a tin of lollies from the two Miss Fullertons good OK  Plenty of rumours flying about as to where we are going  Some rogue stealing money in lines

Men getting very lazy on it.  Band to play to night
