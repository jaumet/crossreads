<p>intention of picking up all the luggage of the other boys &amp; taking it to  wharf. It was appreciated by the boys as it is a fair walk to No 1 wharf  Woolloomooloo.  By 7 AM we had embarked, but it was some considerable time before the people were allowed on wharf.  Had to wait for L Horse Reinforcements.  <br/>We moved out into the stream at about 9.30.  thousands of coloured streamers from boat to wharf formed a very grand &amp; impressive spectacle.  Anchored near Clark Island.  While in stream we were honoured by a visit from Gov General who bade us good bye &amp; safe return in a short but very nice little speech.  Moved      off at 3 pm.  Cleared heads about 3.30 pm.  Sea calm, felt fairly well.  Bed 8.30 pm.  Appointed</p>
