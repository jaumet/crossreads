 Then I go to sleep for awhil , if I go to sleep earlier I general wake up again later on , and then sometim , one of the nurs on night duti bring in some hot milk for the patient who cannot sleep. I told her when she brought me the first lot , that I would keep awak everi night , just to get the milk . This morn she came in at 3 oclock I was awak and , she want to bring me some tea but I would n't let her . She is such a bright jolli girl , near as tall as me just a littl taller than my shoulder , so I call her littl Sister ? She move round the ward , as though she was never tire , but this morn when she came in I could see that she was just about tire out . They have to work hard sometim , then for awhil when the men are near fit to go to a convalesc camp , they have easier time , but there is allway plenti for them to do . Life as a Hospit Nurs would not suit me . I dont think that I will be here much longer my arm is pretti well heal now , but it is stiff I cant rais it veri high but that will soon wear off . then I suppos back again but it is no use worri about that , just at present as long as I dont get much winter work over there . But I suppos it would be near as bad in camp here , in England ? there is a big camp over here for Australian I think somewher . I better no say where lest the censor dissapprov if he see .
