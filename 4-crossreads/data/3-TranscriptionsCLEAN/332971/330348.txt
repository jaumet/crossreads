The scenery is somewhat like Western Scotland only not so rugged.  At 12.30 I wave Wak & Mary farewell with a rather sad heart - I felt it was the breaking away from Mary - my beloved companion and say so - but she says how silly of me to spoil my holiday with such foolish thoughts - why nothing could happen - so feeling a bit lighter hearted about meeting again at the Ivanhoe on Sat night I made up my mind to enjoy 2 days 2 days with Nature & how I loved dit.  The days were something I roamed
