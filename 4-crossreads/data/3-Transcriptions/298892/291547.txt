<p>No. 1515 A.M.C. Detail,<br/>33rd. Batt. 9th. Bge. 3rd. Division, A.I.F.<br/>No.2 Camp, Larkhill, Camp<br/>Salisbury Plains, England.</p>
<p>12th. July, 1916.</p>
<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother/.<br/>You must be very surprised at not having any news from me for so long. We have only just arrived at our destination Salisbury Plains, after 10 weeks on the sea. This constitutes if not quite a record trip for a transport from Australia. We left Sydney on the 3rd May or thereabouts and arrived at Devonport on the 10th July.<br/>After leaving Sydney our first port of call was Albany, where, unfortunately we were not permitted to disembark. From there we set steam for Columbo on route for Egypt via the Suez. When four days out from Albany we received a wireless from Cocos Island ordering us to go round the Cape of Good Hope, and to return to Fremantle if we required more coal for the trip to Cape Town. We accordingly returned to Fremantle and this time were fortunate enough to secure shore leave. I sent some Post Cards from there but possibly they were destroyed by the Censor. There is nothing particularly attractive</p>
