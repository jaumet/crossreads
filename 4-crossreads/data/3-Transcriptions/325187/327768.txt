<p>[Sunday January 23 1916]</p>
<p>Church Service today by Rev Capt Gordon a first rate Padre I think Dean of Goulburn.  I could not help thinking how much better our men look as Troopers with leather equipment riding Pants, leggings &amp; Spurs instead of the Permanent rig-out of the Infantry.  It is hard work to make the average Bushmen march he slouches along with head down, but on a horse looks comfortable so different again to the Tommies who bump along<br/>Cold frosty night again &amp; Days bed soks <strike>were</strike> are a great success-<br/>Volunteers are asked for the Camel Corps, many of our men have offered- in ignorance a good deal, but distant fields etc .</p>
