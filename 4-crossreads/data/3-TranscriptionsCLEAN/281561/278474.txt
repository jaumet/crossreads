23/5/18While on the train was issued with a pass for fourteen days leave, after which I shall report to No 4 A.G.H. for my six months treatment. All along the line we were heartily welcomed and as the train sped on, the boys leaning from the windows would shout; 22 miles to Griffiths Brothers"; then presently again, "twenty miles to Griffiths Bros!" Arrived in Central Station, Sydney, at Mid-day. Went in a procession of motor cars to the Domain Buffet. The streets were decked with bunting, and the enthusiastic crowds in the streets were most embarrassing. A pretty girl I did not know kissed me heartily. A worthy reward! Left the Domain immediately.Went Home.
