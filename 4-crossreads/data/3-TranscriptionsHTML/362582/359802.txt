<p>usually one has a little Arab boy (donkey-boy) running behind &amp; he has a peculiar call to make it go. I had a nice letter from Mrs Capp &amp; so glad she liked the photo. Also poor old Alice writes to me very often. I hope to see George this week. Fred said he is a grand fellow &amp; says he will get on. I do not know where poor old Norman is but must try &amp; send some more cigarettes to him. I think he is out on the Desert not very far from here. Hope Charlie gets his Commission before he comes out again. I had a nice letter from Ella &amp; Doll from Tasmania. I shall try &amp; write them a few lines this week. Dr Cordner was operated upon for appendicitis at No. 1 A.G.H. the day before we left The palace, &amp; I have not heard how he got on since. So glad to hear Flo is so well, I'm awfully sorry I missed seeing Archie. May meet him in France. Talk about Fleas!! You should see our fleas &ndash;</p>
