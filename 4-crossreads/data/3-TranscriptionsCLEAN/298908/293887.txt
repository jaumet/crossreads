  
 & now as I see in the paper this morning they are getting ready to open the Avenue with a great Victory procession.  No wonder the French nation to a man hate Germany with a deep & undying hatred that I don't think will ever die.  As if it was not bad enough to take Alsace-Lorraine & 200,000,000 from her without adding all these cowardly insults to an honourable people who had fought fair & square, but they have had a bit of their own back & now King George is being welcomed by these same people & tomorrow old Foch & Tiger Clemenceau are coming to London how I should like to be there for if ever men deserved a welcome well these are they.  I don't reckon anything is too good for Foch, this war would still have been raging if he had not taken things over & directed operations, & what a success he made of things, & the English people fully realise this.
