 [The following paragraph is crossed through.] Nowell is only 1 mile away & for the past 2 months has been quite close - I have seen him a few times, but he generally rakes up a Lord or a Duke from somewhere & exudes that very English superior air & of course is a Lt. Col, so we don't talk much about Carrakoorte & old days. YES, I got DAYS SOKS with night ones long [indecipherable] - good soks too am start wearing 'em. 
 Last night a total eclipse put the moon out at about midnight, so got home without giving the HUNS a chance to bomb. Heavy DEW each night & a blanket wanted, by day 110 in the shade,  if any .
