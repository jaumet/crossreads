<p>May 1917<br/>we had to do the same, except that: 6 seconds after the smoke bomb burst, the "dinkum" gas was turned on, we picked up our rifles &amp; marched through it.  Later on we marched through a gas area without our helmets, just enough being turned on so that we would be able to recognise it  again.  Lastly we marched behind &amp; through a smoke screen.  I had one man in my troop gassed sufficiently to send him to hospital &amp; others it affected slightly.<br/>We had the same wind &amp; dust again in the afternoon.  We also saw another of our planes being dragged in.  It was brought down yesterday.  In air fights yesterday 2 of ours were brought down</p>
<p>Friday 18th<br/>D Troop rejoined the Squadron  They have been detached over 6 weeks now.  We shifted camp again &amp; are further away from water, being about 3 miles west of the Wadi</p>
<p>Saturday 19th<br/>A heavy wind came up from the SE blowing from the Syrian Desert.  It got very hot towards noon &amp; it was also very dusty.  An English mail arrived.  I got 1 letter from cousin Ella Sutherland.</p>
