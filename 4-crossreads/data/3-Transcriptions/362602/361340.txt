<p>big white grubs that the magpie likes.  We have just finished a bit more work &amp; I am writing on a kerosene tin that we got from the Q.M. [Quartermaster] Stores.  There are a lot of fellows up here that we know well but we are very busy men now &amp; spend all our time amongst our tent mates.  I am trying to get leave for 3 days next weekend.  Jack &amp; Roy are leaving on the 30th of this month so I will go out to their send-off on Saturday night &amp; go over to Ida's place on Sunday morning.  I will be home Sunday afternoon &amp; stay till Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Well I think I have told you all the news this time.  I will write again soon &amp; tell you if I am able to do as I have said above about the leave.</p>
<p>Love to all<br/>From Harry</p>
<p>P.S.  This is Sunday morning &amp; it is glorious.  We will be having breakfast in a few minutes, so I will have to stop.  Our pay arrived but I don't think we are to draw any as our names were not put on the payroll at L'pool.  We all have plenty of money so it does not matter.</p>
<p>Well Au Revoir<br/>Harry</p>
