am, my legs like matches.  I'm afraid that I'm in need of a spell.  A few shells falling close tonight & something may develop later.
Vendredi 17th MaiA fairly quiet day.  Our abdominal case getting on well.  He has a wonderful heart & is making a great fight for it.  Learnt today that a case we had who died suddenly a couple of days ago had meningitis.  He was brought to us at 8 P.M. collapsed at 10 P.M. & was dead at 12 P.M. after we had given him oxygen & artificial respiration for some time.  It is indeed a deadly disease.  The P.M. was done at the C.C.S.Played hockey ay night & won.  Had a swim after, my first for the season.
