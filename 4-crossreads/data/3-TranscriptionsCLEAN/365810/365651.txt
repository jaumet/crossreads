  
 I have sent a batch of them to London, but have had no word through yet as to wheather they arrived there, or were submarined in transit.  Perhaps the public will thus be fortunately spared a repetition of them, but should they come out, I hope you will give me the pleasure of sending you along a copy. 
 Very sincerely yours Norman Lindsay
