<p>Large sick parade in the morning from the 13th Brigade.  Midday our planes brought down a Fritz &amp; had the Pilot, a sgtmajor &amp; the observer in as patients.  The observer died during the afternoon but the pilot was not badly wounded &amp; was sent on to the C.C.S. later.  Both spoke good English.  Also had in several wounded from around the village as he was putting several shells over.  Out transport moved out for safety about a mile away for the sake of the horses.  Several tanks passing through during the evening so it looks as if something is expected.</p>
<p>Saturday 13th April<br/>A very quiet day  Our village was shelled a little during the night also today but casualties were very few.  More tanks passing through &amp; it is noticeable how much easier they are manipulated than formerly. More hockey in the evening and won again.  Major Beard told me today that I had been recommended for the Meritorious Service Medal (M.S.M.) to come</p>
