  
  The Grousers  Oh: we grouses w'en  we trudge Though a sticky stream of sludge, And we mustn't light a pipe without permission: And we 'as our little chunt Wen we 'as to sweat an grunt, With our pouches crammed with bloomin' ammunition Oh! We cusses till it's blue At the daily round of stew, With a special cuss to fit the cook wot sent it. But you precious soon will find Quite a different frame o' mind If we hears a fellow grouses as if 'e meant it. 
 We enjoys our little cuss When the major makes a fuss, An' we likes our playful grumble at the colonel. An' we grouses good an' 'ard When we 'as to go on guard, While inspection makes us chunder most infernal. But although we grouse an' swear W'en outsiders interfere, They are given the straight office to be keerful: They receive a big surprise W'en they start to sympathise - 'cos it's just our funny way of bein' cheerful. 
 When we chunts with all our might You can bet that things is right An' there's nothing that's particularly riling. But w'en things is goin' bad And we should be raving mad
