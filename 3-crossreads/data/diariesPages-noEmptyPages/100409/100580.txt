Up 6 am. At dinner time last night passed Dodge City and in night passed La Junta, the junction for Denver. When having breakfast passed Las Vegas and started going up into the hills which are very rocky about there. Saw great numbers of cattle. Ran into very heavy snowstorm in morning lasting 2 or 3 hours. Put in the morning in the observation car and had good yarn with a Mr Mathews who is a solicitor to Water Board of Los Angeles. He has made an appointment with one there to show me around. He took me into lunch and insisted on paying.
During morning passed Lamy, the Junction for town of Santa Fe and at lunch time arrived at Albuquerque, stopping there one hour. Went for walk down streets with Mr Mathews. Snow is still lying all over the country. Passed some sage bush desert, which is inclined to be sandy, after leaving Alberquerque. Bought picture p/cards at Lamy and Alberquerque, also near latter saw the Rio Grande River.
 At dinner time sat near a Chicago manufacturer, so he asked me into his compartment and yarned about Australia and the war for over two hours. Just before entering Arizona saw some most peculiar formations in the hills. 
Put watch back 1 hour at Seligman. Went to bed 9.30 pm.
