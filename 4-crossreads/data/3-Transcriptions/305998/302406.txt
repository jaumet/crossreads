<p>January 1st 1916</p>
<p>We were up at 4 am &amp; had breakfast at 5 am &amp; then went out to Dead mans gully as an escort for the New Zealanders who were going out to bring in one of their men who was killed on Xmas Day. We found him two days after he was killed, he was stripped of all his clothing &amp; equipment but was left with his identity disc. So we sent it to their headquarters so you will see that they have been a long time deciding to bury him, killed on the 25th Dec &amp; this the 1st of January.</p>
