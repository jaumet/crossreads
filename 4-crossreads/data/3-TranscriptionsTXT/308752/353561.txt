4th July 1918. - 15th July.American Independence Day, & from all accounts the enemy got "hell" all along the Line. The Yanks were well in the straffing also. Batches of prisoners were passing our camp all day.  I believe they numbered 800 all told.
On the 5th inst. a debate was held, the subject was - "which had the most influence on Public opinion, the Press or the Platform". Three men were chosen from our Unit, to represent the Press, & three from another Ambulance for the other side.  I enjoyed listening to the arguments put forth, it was something out of the ordinary.
On Tuesday the 9th inst. I received work that a certain Unit was close by our camp, so I took a stroll along there, & came across two old friends of mine from Neutral Bay - Stan Solomons, & Don Eaton. I forgot to mention that a couple of days ago I also came across two more mates - Allen Murray & Frank Haines.
The 108th. U.S.A. Engineers Concert Party gave a concert to our Unit, on the 12th. inst.   A platform had been erected out in the open close by our camp, & the entertainment went off without a hitch.   The programme was a splendid one & some of the items "took" with the "Aussies". The following day our Brigade Band gave a recital at our camp.  Fifteen members of this band were on board the Beltana in November 1915, so they are evidently going strong.  The band master Sgt. Wellings, was in that famous Manly band, before the war.
Who should I meet to day but Pte. Daley, another old friend of mine, whom I have not seen for about ten years.
