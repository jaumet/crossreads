<p>Friday 10 September, 1915</p>
<p>Named our dugout. It has the distinction of being the first place on &quot;Courtneys&quot; to have a name. It&#39;s monica is &quot;Kangarooma&quot;</p>
<p>Two men of the 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;collected last night. It was their last watch before going away for a rest, a case of &quot;stiff knees&quot;.</p>
<p>Have been doing a bit of cooking today. I got hold of a tin of milk. Breakfast, bread &amp; milk, Dinner, boiled rice &amp; tea rissoles. Quite an elaborate diet for here.</p>
<p>A bomb burst just outside our gun pit last night &amp; a piece came through the opening passing between myself &amp; the chap who was on with me. You don&#39;t seem to be safe here anywhere lately.</p>
