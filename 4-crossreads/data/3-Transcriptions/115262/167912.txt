<p>Friday 25 May 1917.</p>
<p>Further&nbsp;still&nbsp;into the &quot;danger zone&quot;&nbsp;<s>still</s>.</p>
<p>A slight swell this morning. Marching order parade at 10 a.m. (All kit correct.). Physical training from 2 pm. till 4 pm. Games on deck later till 5 p.m. Did some sewing from 6 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Tonight swell about the same although the surface of the water is unbroken by any ripple. Perhaps &amp; indication of stormy weather coming?</p>
