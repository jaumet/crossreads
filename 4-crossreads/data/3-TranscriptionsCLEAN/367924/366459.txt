  
 I hear the recruiting crowd are very strong in Kojonup lately. I reckon they ought to be hounded out of the place. Kojonup has sent a lot more than could be spared as it is. Its a pity the recruiting people dont look into the camps & send the men away who are slacking in khaki. There is one man here in camp still whom I know; was a seargent at Blackbay when my 2 brothers were in camp 2 years ago he is a lieutenant now & is here still, he has cost the government some hundreds why dont they see that he, & the likes of him, get before they drag men off their farms to face the music while these rotten wretches slack it in uniform. 
 I call it a howling disgrace one man went away last month who had been in camp over 3 years I would just like to get the chance to tell the recruiting mob of these things, let them come to the city; there are hundreds here who could go but have no intention of enlisting men who have no responsibility; men who work for wages & spend it at picture shows trots etc. Its makes me so mad I could just swear about it -
