Ratcliffe Vivash, Geo Crawford Mills (Ser Elliot (limber) of Amb. Had been spkg to Bob. not a minute before &amp; hurriedly left him to get into cart. Cart was not more than 50 yds away. Moved out further, outposts in touch &amp; intermittent rifle &amp; art fire on our front. Inf attacking &amp; met with some success. Plently of rumours but nothing definite as to what was done.<br/><strike>18th</strike> - Returned to near Wadi about 9 pm. Rough road &amp; dust too thick to see a yard ahead.
