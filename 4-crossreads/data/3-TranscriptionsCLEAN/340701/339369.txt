After breakfast we again were asked to fall in for more Fatigue but I did not do so but went to the other side of the Canal to cut out time.  It would be a God send to have a swim here but there is not only the germs to consider but the natives use it  as a Latrine.  No wonder their children look as if they were poisoned.  It is a pitifull sight to see the Gippos standing gaurd over the garbage pits at meal times they watch the stuff & sort it out & a lot of stuff that a starved Sydney dog would turn his nose up at is turned into the food tin & the rest into the refuse tins.  They eat the first lot.  I seen one kid with a boot shining outfit put his hand into the box among the brushes etc. & take out a crust so hard that it rang like a biscuit bite a bit off & put it back among his polishing utensils.
