 Oct  19th  20 Dartford Yesterday was a lovely day. After tea went into Dartford, after a while went into the pictures, but discovered that it was the same lot that I had seen before there. 
 No 3 Auxillery Hosp. Dartford Tuesday Oct. 22nd 18 Lovely day, not cold. Yesterday afternoon I went to London, to the performance at Her Majesty's, for Australians. We saw the Revue, 'Choo Chin Chow' &amp; it was very fine. In the interval after the second act, Sir Peter McBride, Agent Gen. to Victoria spoke a few words, said that Australians had done   every thing that  as good as he could wish them to have done, &amp; asked us to give three cheers for Mr Oscar Asche who gave the performance. We had a cup of tea passed round &amp; on leaving were all given a packet of cigarettes with Mr Asche's compliments. This afternoon am going to see The Bing Boys of Broadway. 
 Oct 26- 18 The Bing Boys turned out to be a picture show instead, so I did not go in, had a bus ride out somewhere &amp; back in the tube
