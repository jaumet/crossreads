<p>I hope these notes will be read by you Mother &amp; no one else but our Captain has been drunk for the past 2 days &amp; was also at Plymouth &amp; Weymouth, it is bad enough travelling under normal conditions but now a man wants all the brains the Almighty ever gave him. The Doctor is of the same type but keeps out of the way, the P. &amp; O. of the old days would not stand this sort of thing. Bright sunshine &amp; warmer.</p>
