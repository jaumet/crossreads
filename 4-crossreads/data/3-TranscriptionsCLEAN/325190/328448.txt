road bordering river, where we were allowed to walk.This seems to be a regular stopping place for troops going up the line, judging by the notices in the canteen.Chatted to some Frenchmen who were guarding Boche prisoners.  Not very intelligent & only spoke the obvious things a French soldier says to a Colonial.We are falling in at 3 p.m. to entrain again, this time for the long run I imagine; so we shall soon reach the line.It is raining hard, but I don't feel particularly miserable.
