<p>THE ROYAL OVERSEAS OFFICERS CLUB at the R.A.C.<br/>Pall Mall London S.W.I.<br/>Received 9-10-17<br/>15-8-17.</p>
<p>Dear Mother and Father,<br/>This afternoon I had to come up to London to order a new pair of glasses. I have had my present ones for over two years and I find that I cannot see well enough with them. I also took my field glasses to get some old Egyptian sand cleaned out of them.<br/>.<br/>The address on the head of this paper is that of the old Royal Automobile Club. They were told that the Government intended to take over the premises so they promptly formed it into an Officers Club and made all Overseas Officers honorary members. The building is a most magnificent one. The smoking room I am sitting in is about an acre in extent and is filled with chairs which fairly make you comfortable to look at them. The tucker in the dining room is as good as anything I have found in London. Inside the building there is a large swimming bath all marble and about 30 yards long. I am looking forward to a swim there next Saturday.</p>
<p>Last week end I spent with Darcy Roberts. We went to look at the famous Kew Gardens. They are not a patch on the Sydney Botanical Gardens. We also went and walked along the bank of the famous Putney-Mortlake Championship Course. It is a dreadful place and also not a patch on the old Parramatta River.<br/>Next Saturday we hope to go up to Oxford</p>
<p>I am still playing Golf with Beiers. I am still rotten but am very fond of it. Beiers went up to receive his Military Cross from the King to-day.</p>
<p>Great excitement in London to-day at the march past of the U.S.A. Troops I think they are going to have a very good effect.</p>
<p>I am just going back to the School,</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Your Affectionate Son<br/>C.R. LUCAS</p>
