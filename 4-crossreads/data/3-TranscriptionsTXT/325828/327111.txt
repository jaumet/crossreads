To-day I have had 5 trips altogether, 3 solo flights totalling 2 &frac12; hrs, &amp; 2 dual flights. My favourite occupation is to take a bus (we always call an aeroplane a "bus,"- "Oh! she is a slow old bus) up that is fitted with a Camera gun.  This explains itself.   For  To all appearances it is an ordinary machine gun, but on pressing the Bowden Control on the "joystick" (the main control column in a plane) instead of the gun projecting a bullet it takes a photo.

Occasionally the other machine puts up a fight, &amp; then all the knowledge, &amp; skill comes into play, each machine twisting &amp; turning trying to get his ring sights onto the other machine.

I twisted &amp; turned my old bus about, until I hardly knew whether "I was on my head or my heels."  It was fine sport &amp; splendid practice, &amp; when a few days later I saw the film that the Scout pilot took, on that occasion, I saw that
