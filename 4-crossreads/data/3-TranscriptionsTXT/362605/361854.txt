in London but it would have meant a longer stay over here & I have not pushed it.  I do not expect to be relieved from here for at least 4 months so I should get Home just in time for X'mas.
I am quite happy & not a bit lonely that Ellis has gone.  Both of us could not go & it is only by chance that my application was turned down & that His was accepted.  My whole time is occupied & I rarely have 10 minutes to loaf.  Even now at 10 pm I must go down & shave, clean my boost etc, for the mornings are icy & freezing & it is much too cold to shave with any degree of comfort.
We are still very busy here & it is rumoured that they are going to make me a warrant officer temporarily, the Irish Mans's rise again but rumours rarely come to anything in the army.  Just address letters Sgt. or S/Sgt. & they will get me alright.
I must go now for I had a very busy day & have been reading & writing since 5 pm. I am stiff from Hockey & must shave etc.
Kindest Regards to all my dear Friends.  I have written to most & told them not to write to me as I expect to be Home shortly.  I expect nothing of the kind but I have not the time to write letters now & I have no wish to break my vow to answer every letter that I have received.  I have written over 1600 letters since I came away & it is a good performance for me.
Best Love to you all.  I hope to see you sooner than X'mas but the Fates will decide
Your own Boy & BrotherHarry
