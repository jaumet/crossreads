2/1/18 Kent & London
through the soft variegated countryside all much greener than France. Many hop fields with their forest of stakes & their kilns. Ran into London about 4 to Victoria Station and after trying the Grosvenor put up with Fairweather at the Belgrave Mansions. Went out up Buckingham Palace Road to make a few purchases but had difficulty in finding the way owing to the absolute black darkness prevailing. Much struck by the lack of politeness, curtness & boorishness of the people in shops - French manners & politeness have spoilt us. Went up to Piccadilly by tube and dined at Scotts on oysters bitters & cheese. Everything very dark here and the streets crowded with women. Walked round for a while & then went & saw Geo. Robey in Zig Zag at the Hippodrome. Slept long and well through until about 8.30 in the morning.
