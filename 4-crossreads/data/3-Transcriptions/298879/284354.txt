<p>April 1915<br/>Friday 2<br/>Sergeant Harvey our Platoon Commander says we are to move off tomorrow.. He did not say where. Arthur was out to see me again today He says his Regimental colours are chocolate and Navy Blue.<br/>Saturday 3<br/>Met some very pleasant people at Cairo Station &amp; they took me and a Corporal over to have some tea. They were looking for 2 nd Batt.<br/>Preparations made to leave Camp. Arthur came out again. Fourth Batt has already left. Our Reg left at 5.30 P.M, leaving C Coy. to look after the few tents still standing &amp; the black kit bags. Its a marvel that this last rumour should be true as it was not given out officially</p>
