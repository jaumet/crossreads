 My dear Conway, 
 I was awfully pleased to hear from you & get all the news.  We are in the desert now about 5 miles north of Ismalia digging trenches in the sand which is a devil of a job but we will do it all right. 
 My Bn. is in very good form & working well.  Of course we have a few wasters but I am putting the acid on them.  F.G.C.M. [Field General Court Martial] starts this morning four cases.  We are well looked after here now, at first it was a bit tough, all transport was by camel, wood, water, rations &c. & they hadn't half enough but now everywhere you look you see camels, there must be thousands here now.  We are getting water laid on & a light line for trams 2 ft. gauge running behind the camps.  This will lighten the transport animals a bit.  We get the Sydney papers most of them here so we know something of what you are doing over yr side.  Rami seems to be in the boom.  I hope he
