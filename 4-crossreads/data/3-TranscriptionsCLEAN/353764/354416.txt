However we got out O.K. & after have some Refreshments at Saults, got a Taxi & drove home, at the rate of close on 80 miles an hour.  I often wondered how we would get on if a wheel came off. Our 4th Divisional Train is now forming & in a week or so will be complete. 
 2nd 3.16 Thursday We were inspected by Major Holdsworth to-day who is the Divisional Train Commander & he told us that we would shortly be on active Service in a strange Country, so he has left us guessing.  He expressed himself as being satisfied at our turnout. Moving to-morrow so am very busy.  Expecting draft of 105 men to-night 
 3.3.16. Friday 105 fresh men came in last night & I had a very busy time fixing them up.  We shifted Camp to-day to a place called Luna Park, & after a rather hard day have now settled down again
