  
 Special report  XIA - 8th & 9th August, 1918. Brief account of experiences in the advance. 
 A brief account of my experiences as an Ambulance Bearer, in that advance of the 8th & 9th August 1918. 
 5th August. Startling orders given out on parade this morning - the Bearers will fall in at 2 p.m. & proceed towards the line again. We were told that our experiences would be of a different nature than they have been in the past, as an exceptionally big stunt was coming off. 
 Punctually at 2 p.m. the Bearers parade, carrying a few necessary articles that will be required, together with ambulance gear such as stretchers, wheel stretchers, bandages, & splints etc. "some load" "believe me." 
 About 4 p.m. we start off, but the march was an unpleasant one, as it rained continually all the while we were on the road.  Arrived at the village where our Ambulance ran an Advanced Dressing Station last April & May - the place was more knocked about than ever. Our Stretcher Squad managed to find a cellar, & we were fairly comfortable for the night. Slept like a top, & woke in the morning feeling very much refreshed, & found that the weather had cleared up.
