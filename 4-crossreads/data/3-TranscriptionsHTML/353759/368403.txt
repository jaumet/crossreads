<p>337<br/>The "Dugout" when I get home:  Brown walls, cream matt woodwork, gold ceiling, green curtains and fireplace tiles.  Buff and vermilion rugs, and Books, Books, Books.  The only book in the dugout was Keats.</p>
<p>338<br/>Last night &ndash; our last, and most exciting carrying.  Called up at 11 p.m., a shell had landed in the dugout on a ridge alongside Flers, of 4 M. Gunners, killing one and wounding another.  One of the chaps came running down to our post, and our squad was sent out.  When we got over to them, Fritz started a barrage of shells turn round the spot;  we fixed the poor beggar up, pulled the dead boy out, and when Fritz had stopped, started out.  Just as we"d reached our aid post, three high explosives landed in the valley we"d just passed, and as we started again for the second relay post, he landed a few more over.  When we got back, we were mud to the shoulders and jolly surprised to find ourselves whole and kicking.  When we"d fixed the wounded boy up, and were waiting our opportunity to get him along, one of the chaps asked the runner &ndash; whose come over to get us &ndash; when he was going to sleep.</p>
<p>"Not in these Mate", and there was all the tenor of the unknown in his voice.  "I"ll just stay in and walk round".</p>
<p>"But your poor mate, dead, mate, we"ll put him out on the parapet, and I"ll sleep in with you!"  "Yes, he"s dead!", if you"ll come in with me mate?"  Then he turned to the chap we"d put on the stretcher, "Ow is it mate?"  Mate was all right and had some instructions &ndash; "there"s a gold ring round Charlie"s &ndash; his &ndash; neck, he"d like his mother to have it &ndash; will you get it?"</p>
<p>In the short time we were there tragedies untold were acted, and the active only boys &ndash; but boys with the hearts of lions, and Dinkum.  All the discomforts in the world are compensated for by the simple "Thank you mate" of the chap when you"ve carried him to the next aid post.</p>
<p>239  Dec. 15<br/>When I got back to Ghezireh from Abbassiah last January from No. 4 Aux., Jimmy Houston had left, and had, with most of the Port Lincoln crowd, joined up the 1st L.H.F.A.  The next time I saw him was perhaps six or seven weeks later when he came up one day for a bath.  (Oh, for a bath now.)  Then he looked an unutterable, superb larrikin, leggings and boots lacking oil or polish for the time he"d left No. 2, worn to a standstill, Brushes worn through and in shreds, Tunic ripped and torn, and too small for him, and hat with all the stiffening knocked out of it.  His color and expression were perfect, hands, face and neck rich ruddy brown, well worked up with dirt, and a week"s growth of beard.  I envied him for his candid enjoyment of things and for he"s having genuinely roughed it.  Yesterday, I"d realised his condition to a T, though instead of sand dirtied clothes, ours were mud soaked, and the experience is worth it.</p>
<p>340<br/>One night at Flers we thought Fritz had on some new "jumping jack" explosive, but it was only a shell landed into a grenade dump across the way &ndash; about 5 yards &ndash; from the dugout.  One bomb landed in the next sap and didn"t explode:  early the following morning, a party of Engineers going through passed it, and one of the boys kicked it.  Bang! &ndash; and not a beggar got touched.</p>

<p>"C.C.S.".  Under the ten flags at Buire, at the Anzac Rest Camp, a crowd of Inf. boys in varying dugouts, and a line of grey ambulance wagons.</p>
<p>"An Aid Post", with the V shaped cross flag above the dugout entrance &ndash; pinned above the door, not flown on a pole.</p>
