Church parade in Church Army hut at 9.30. marched too and from it with the band. After an inspection of the huts of one company went over to Bde.H.Q and saw the General and B.M. and discussed the work to be done up forward. A fine clear day with a cold sun. The 24th. beat us at soccer this afternoon. Bunning's marching orders for India came. Towards dark there was an airfight between Gothas and our planes. Interviewed a draft of reinforcements who had just marched in and had a talk of with the new officer Parsons (M.M. Croix de Guerre) a good lad who commenced with us as a private. At evening the frost was still as thick on rooves as it was first thing this morning. News today of the definite turning down of conscription in Australia ? a negative majority of 200,000 so the breakup of some of the divisions appears inevitable.
