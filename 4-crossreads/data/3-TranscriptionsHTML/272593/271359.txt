<p>just dump him over the parados for the time being, &amp; that's the end of it.<br/>28th. Slept in till 9' oclock this morning &amp; then had breakfast. after this Bill Bayne &amp; I went hunting for souvenir's. I have scoured the country for miles &amp; miles looking for these "oyster bombs" which the Germans have, but I have never found one yet, but if perseverance will succeed I'll have one.<br/>Some of the boys got some good souvenirs off the Germans in the shape of revolvers, watches, rings &amp; etc, but I don't believe in the way some of them go through the Tommies &amp; our own chaps you can find letters photos &amp; such things all over the battlefield.</p>
