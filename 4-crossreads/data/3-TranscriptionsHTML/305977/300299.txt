<p>about who have never seen the front  We did not make an impressive spectacle <u>marching?</u> to the station.  We were not an unruly mob, but the officers allowed some laxity.  When we passed some well dressed new arrived the boys would shout Who's Chatty"! <u>Chorus</u> I am! &amp; Are we "Kiwi" soldiers <u>Answer</u> No!<br/>At Cairo, we had to march 2 miles through the town to Bab-el-ouk &amp; we got a lot of Arab boys to carry our overcoats &amp; rifles  Most of us had no packs as we had to leave them behind us, except those that were sent away ahead &amp; it is unlikely we will see them again.  We got to Maadi about 4 oclock &amp; jolly glad we were to get back.</p>
<p>Tuesday 28th<br/>We all got paid &pound;2/11/6 or 250 piastres.  A lot of the old that had gone away sick had returned before</p>
