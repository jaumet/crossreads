<p>E3 has been missing over a week in the North Sea  -  E signifies a class only the highest &amp; best class of British Submarines up to date - There's a D &ndash; class &amp; C class &ndash; F class will be higher than E but as yet its not in existence &ndash; therefore of the 3 E boats &ndash; 1 &amp; 3 are gone &amp; only the Australian E2 is afloat  -  Wonder what the Commander thinks?<br/>It was nice coming up the harbor in her  -  She conveys a sense of power to you as she rapidly moves with <strike>8</strike> her 1600 horse power Diesel engines &ndash; (2 at 800 each)  -  Everyone comes to the shipside to see AE2 as she passes  -  Personally I think the Destroyers give me as big a sense of power &amp; a lot more feeling of Security  -</p>
