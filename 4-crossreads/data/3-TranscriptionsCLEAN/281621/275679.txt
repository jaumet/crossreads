Monday 1At Bernefay at A.I.S. The weather is still wet and dull and in no wise different from that which we have been having all along lately.
Tuesday 2Today I was warned to go on leave on 27th inst. Saw George Wilkie this afternoon, he is camped over the road.
Wednesday 3I with a few others move back to the unit at Buire which is just as desolate as ever
Thursday 4Tonight a party of us went to see the "Shrapnel" at Merricourt and enjoyed a very good variety show.
Friday 5Still at Buire where the weather lately has been fine and nice. I notice some shelling on a hill a couple of miles away but I have no idea whether it is our practice or Fritz.
