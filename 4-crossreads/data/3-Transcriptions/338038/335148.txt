<p>Gallipoli Peninsula<br/>9th October 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>As you see I am again back in the Peninsula having arrived early on the morning of the 6th after a good trip up. I had not expected to find things in any way different from when I left and was right. Everything is just the same only if anything quieter.<br/>First of all I must thank you both ever so much for letters received &ndash; Mum's of April 9th and Father's of July 25th and 30th and August 1st, 8th and 9th, also the numerous Heralds, T &amp; C Jul &amp; Syd Mail, as well as parcel of underclothing from Joe Pearson's. The latter has come at a most opportune time and I cannot thank you enough for it. Although the hot weather is still with us, which is quite exceptional for Octr in these parts, we are expecting a change at any time now, and when it comes the woollens will be a God-send. The articles contained in the parcel were &ndash; undershirts 2 : underpants 2 : woollen sleeping cap : flannell shirts 2 : and socks 2 pairs which pans out correctly according to your letter, but the parcel containing the 4 pairs socks mentioned has not yet put in any appearance. However, I have not given up hope of it as parcel service certainly</p>
