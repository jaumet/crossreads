<p>Easterly wind (appropriate isn't it) blowing.  I quite expect to see another fall of snow by morning.  I think it is nearly time this weather took a tumble to itself &amp; <strike>give</strike> gave Spring a chance.<br/>By the way, I ran across Capt. Parkinson (a very red haired S.H.S boy) who is over from France on Furlough.  He is with the 14th. Fld Amblce, &amp; when I made myself known, asked very kindly how you were, &amp; wished to be remembered to you.  I knew him at Tel-el-Kebir &amp; also at Serapeum when he was with the 1st. Fld Ambulance.<br/>I am keeping in splendid health, &amp; sincerely trust this finds you well.  Give my love to Mother, Wal, Ol, &amp; Anna.  I will try &amp; get letters to them written this week.  Must close, Father dear,<br/>With much love to yourself,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>J  Leo L. Waterhouse.</p>
