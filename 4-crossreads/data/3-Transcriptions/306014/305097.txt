<p>one small shop. A very small boy, to whom we spoke, escorted us through the place &amp; interested a good deal &amp; after we had given him a couple of pennies &amp; some cigarette cards for his birthday, which was a few days back, he was very anxious in inviting us back another day. At tea time we resorted to the only shop in the place but were somewhat dismayed when the lady told us that she could not supply us. However, she had plenty of bread etc, &amp; so we bought 2lb of bread &amp; 1lb bottle of jam &amp; cut the loaf into five slices &amp; spread all the jam on it &amp; sat down on the wayside to eat it. An old lady noticed us &amp; very kindly sent over to us a nice jug of hot tea &amp; a cup &amp; we just "carried on" until&hellip;&hellip;.there was none left. We then started home &amp; after about four miles walk</p>
