<p>so if we are here for some time it will be a great chance to see a good deal of Europe in general.  It is a bit of a welcome change to travel as an officer after having been in the ranks for so long, there are so many more priveleges, and one gets treated better everywhere.  I think I was exceptionally lucky to have been out of the last few months of the fighting, my battalion suffered heavily again. They were in the Peronne and St Quentin fighting, only one officer out of my company came through.</p>
<p>I have not had any letters from home for a couple of months, they must  be going astray somewhere. I hope everything is OK at home.</p>
<p>Sincerely hoping that all at home are in the best of health, with fondest love to all,<br/>Your loving son<br/>Gordon<br/>Address Lieut G.J.E<br/>54th Battn<br/>A.I.F.<br/>France</p>
