  
 [Friday 10 March 1916] 
 Yesterday met Judge & local prosecutor  [indecipherable]    very worthy no doubt but could not understand a word they said, however enjoyed the day. Just heard my leave granted from tonight till Sunday morning so ride in to  Samalut - wired for a bed to Continental Hotel & arrived at 9 pm. Cairo was a gay city after the Desert, & I intend to combine business with pleasure.  Rang up Mardi but hear she is out.  Got reserves commissions for A Squadron done & heard all latest news-   Not many old friends Cairo is full of Soldiers.
