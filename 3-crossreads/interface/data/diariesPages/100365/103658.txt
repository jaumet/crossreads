6.7.16 Thursday The offensive still continues in the Somme Sector prisoners, guns and war material is coming in fast. Total of prisoners up to date 13,000 with 10 complete Batteries of heavy light Artillery. There is no mistake that at last the Germans are being driven out of the burrows we all hope that it will continue.I am now opposite the Armentieres Ypres Sector today a furious bombardment has started. This means a lively night as the Artillery is always more furious at night time than in the day.Our observation Balloons have been up all the afternoon also Aeroplanes have been pretty busy spying out the enemy positions.The rain has now stopped I hope it will fine off, as it is helping to impede our advance.From all accounts the Russians have started a fresh offensive against the Germans finding themselves attacked on several fronts will serve to demoralise them.At present I do not know whether we are to stay on the front or go further South. It has been rumoured that we are going North again, but I do not think so as they seem to have plenty of Troops down there.We are very busy on Transport duties, as these offensives mean high pressure on all modes of Transport to shift material to the Trenches. My particular job is with the Artillery I can assure you it is sure exciting.
