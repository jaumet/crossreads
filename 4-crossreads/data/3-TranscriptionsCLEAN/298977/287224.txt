  
 France, 28th April 1916. 
 Dear Dad, 
 Am not going to answer your long letter of February last by this mail, this is only asking for a bit of information. 
 From here we stand a pretty good chance of getting a week's leave to England, in fact I believe mine comes pretty shortly, as I happen to be an original, and also had the luck to go through the last campaign without getting on injured or sick list.  One thing is blocking me in a way though.  I happen (as far as I know) to have no relations over there and was wondering if you could remedy that for me.  If you have no relations over there, you'd better invent some, as I'm anxious to get this trip.  It will break the monotony somewhat.  Another thing if I do get there, could you fix up anything about me getting some cash.  Of course I have my pay book and Commonwealth Bank Receipt, but I understand there is some delay in getting fixed up in this quarter, and as I said before we are only allowed seven days. 
 Am now back in billets again after a spell in the trenches.  Had a fairly easy time though for the first part the weather was very rough.  It has fined up now though and is beautiful. 
 Mail arrangements over here at present very disarranged, and we are still getting dribs and drabs of our first mail. 
 As I said before will write more fully when I can think of anything interesting. 
 Am just going to have a hot bath. 
 Love to all, Your loving Son, Roy.
