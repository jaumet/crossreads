Have not had boots off for a week, feet stink and the pattern of the socks is driven into the skin. Lousy too and filthy but quite happy. Involuntary exclamations that leap to men's lips. Heard two this morning "Good loving J - Dear b ? C -", when they were merely expressing surprise at the damage done by a shell. 
Turkish for come here "Boo-ri-gler Gel".
Draft arrived last night Col Hutchison among them. Two of our men reporting back. Inspected some ammunition. Some American made very nicely finished and beautifully clean. Opened cartridge. Propellant little black round beads like black beads children thread. Put a match to contents and they flared away with great blaze. Opened up Australian made, little sticks of resin coloured stuff like lengths of thin cat gut 2  inches long, also burnt slowly. 
Man from 23rd Battn just called in and said Jack had been taken away to hospital with sore throat. Another mail in 15 bags for battalion all hands sorting. Result of bombardment this morning when all men were put in the saps 1 man badly cut up with serious shrapnel wounds 4 rifles broken 23rd 1 killed 3 wounded 24th 4 killed 12 wounded.
Parcel of gift stuff sardines figs biscuits came to hand.
1605 Went down to 6th Field Ambulance to see Jack and found him lying on stretcher in hospital looking ill with diarrhoea tonsillitis. Gave him some letters and cheered him up as much as possible. Great climb back through saps past mules and Indian Camp and sweated like a pig. Fatigues carrying heavy stores on their shoulders feel the pinch but take their time on the job always
