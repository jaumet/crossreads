 pleasant &amp; exciting.  We left here with a convoy 1 mile long for a 40 mile trip across the Desert.  On the way the route passed through the 2 dead Cities of Egypt &amp; although I was only able to view same from my horse it was decidedly interesting. The Arabs were in their thousands as being good Friday they all go to the Cities to pray for their ancient ancestors.  The track was very narrow in places &amp; needed great care to safeguard the Convoy. After passing the Cities we emerged onto the Desert &amp; then began a weary trip.  We had to halt every hour or so to spell the horses &amp; water them.  The fine sand was very troublesome as it fills your eyes &amp; nose &amp; nearly suffocates you.  My eyes are all blood shot to-day on account of same. 
 It was a wonderful sight to see the Convoy stretched out over the sandy ridges just for all the world like a giant snake. We passed through Maadi which is where the Turkish Prisoners are camped &amp; proceeded to the outskirts of the town to pick up our loads.
