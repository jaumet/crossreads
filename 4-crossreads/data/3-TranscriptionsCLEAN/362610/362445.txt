  
 Thursday 17 August 1916 Had a little sleep last night being well off because of having blankets & waterproof with me & room on the floor to stretch out. Several showers during the day & the ground everywhere extremely slippery. A lot of noise as we were almost surrounded by guns, those behind being especially troublesome. A number of premature bursts occurred during the time we were in, but I do not know whether any casualties were caused. The aerial activity was remarkable : one afternoon I counted 18 sausage balloons & 20 aeroplanes in the air at one time. A German machine was quite an unusual sight, but on one of the days we had the chance of seeing one brought down in flames by one of our airmen.
