only one or two of the officers noticed that my condition wasn't normal.  I had foolishly made up my mind not to leave the firing trenches till we were relieved or on a stretcher, & fortunately we were relieved before the latter mode of exit was necessary.  During the whole of that time I didn't eat as much as I would normally eat in two days & during the last four days my nourishment consisted of 4 3 eggs which my orderly managed to purchase on the beach - one egg per diem with one day missed for luck.  However I'm well on the mend now, & by the time you get this, hope to be back in the trenches.  I'm very comfortable here & being well looked after.  In this ward besides myself are one Colonel & 5 Majors.
I have a number of photos which I took before leaving Cairo which I will send over in a less bulky letter.  We were not allowed to take our cameras to the front.
Your loving son,Arthur
