<p>2 &ndash; by me in Egypt &ndash; but I'm too stupid to write tonight. Col Jamieson looks splendid &ndash; it will be nice to have him near me for a bit.<br/>A number of sisters are going back on transport duty and I shall send a packet of letters with a trustworthy one for you &amp; Father to read &amp; keep for me. I cant carry them round. The girls' are very interesting and a few from active service men &ndash; though short, give impressions of the trenches etc at Gallipoli. I shall also try and write a decent letter to send you. I received no letters from you by the mail which left Sydney about 27th Feb. about the time the troops played up a Liverpool. I was awfully disgusted to hear about it. I have not actually seen any papers about it. I hope it has been exagerated and that Father <u>did not</u> help to quell the mob with his shelali. I am anxious not having news of you. I am afraid my letters from Lemnos during the evacuation were held back as other peoples' <strike>have</strike> were. I'm glad I sent the cable on arriving here.</p>
