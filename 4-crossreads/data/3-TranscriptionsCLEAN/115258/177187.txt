 My dear Father, 
 Ten weeks to Easter! Yes I reckon i can do it. Though a person will want to start pretty soon if there is going to be quarantine or any of that sort of business before landing in Australia. But as I said before. I think I can do it. There are 500 men to go from here by the 'Seramic' we heard but of course none from this ward can go with that lot as we are all still in isolation for this blessed flu. Though most of us are pretty right from it now. i wonder how much wheat you are putting in this year. I ought to be able to give you a hand with the sowing anyway. I have not had any letters from you lately - the last were dated 11th & 22nd Nov. but I think I answered them before. Fred must be some driver now alright to drive
