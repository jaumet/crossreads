  
 PART 1. 
 Throughout the first period the Squadron continued to operate from the aerodrome at MEJDEL, Major R. Williams D.S.O. Commanding with Flight Commanders as under:- 'A' Flight   -  Lieut. A.R. Brown 'B' Flight   -  Captain S.W. Addison 'c'  Flight  -  Captain R.M. Smith M.C. 
 OPERATIONS: With the close of 1917 came also the end of a series of desperate attempts on the part of the enemy to re-capture JERUSALEM and its environs, the fall of which was not only a great loss to him strategically but, moreover, was politically calamitous. Therefore, it was not surprising to find from documents captured later, that a few days after the ancient city fell into our hands, orders were flashed out by the Turkish higher command that it had to be recaptured at all cost. A strong attack with picked troops was accordingly launched and pressed with marked tenacity for 4 days; but the enemy was beaten off and ultimately driven back on a 12 mile front to a depth of 3 miles. About the same time several smaller enterprises were undertaken by our forces along the Coastal Sector with the object of 'providing more effectively for the protection of JERUSALEM and JAFFA'.  These operations also were successful. Thus the commencement of the New Year saw our front line extending from a point slightly North of ARAUF, passing immediately North of MULEBBIS through ET TIRE, thence through the hills eastward crossing the JERUSALEM-NABLUS ROAD 5 miles North of BIREH, swinging to the South East through MUKHUNAS to a point just West of EL MUNTAR.   The Turkish Armies had been broken into two parts, one force of 5 divisions having halted in the plain to the North of LUDD and JAFFA the remainder, approximately six divisions, having retired down the Eastern slopes of the mountains of Judea, coming to rest in the region of the Jordan Valley. It might be noted here that throughout these operations the machines of 1st Squadron carried out daily reconnaissances of the enemy's movements and dispositions to a distance of about 40 miles behind his front line; made numerous machine gun attacks upon Troops, Camps, Transport and other ground targets, in addition to carrying out a number of bomb raids of selected targets.  Recognition of this work was officially recorded in a Despatch from the Commander in Chief which stated that during those days the Air Force not only gained valuable and timely information but repeatedly attacked the enemy's troops and transport with bombs and machines guns from low altitudes, inflicting considerable losses. 
 During the month of January and the early part of February there was comparatively little fighting on the 'ground'. Only a few small raids were carried out but, nevertheless, it was by no means a period of inactivity, notably as far as the Air Force was concerned. Extensive and important works were taken in hand in preparation for big events to come. In this work 1st Squadron played a very conspicuous part. Throughout the first four weeks enemy territory back to a line from the coast of TULKERAM, thence to NABLUS, JERICHO, the JORDAN VALLEY and the DEAD SEA was actively reconnoitred. Two reconnaissances were made daily, one over the Coastal Sector, the other over the Eastern Area extending as far as AMMAN while periodically our machines went on as far North as JENIN and AFULE,  where two large enemy Aerodromes were located, one of which was apparently new. 
 A considerable portion of the area reconnoitred during this period was 'new territory' over which no British machines had flown up till this stage. Our machines 'swept' this country for about 60 Miles behind the enemy's lines and much information of incalcuable value and striking interest was gleaned by our Observers. New aerodromes, important railway centres, new railway and road works, extensive dumps the transport parks, concentration camps - all these and many other things of great military significance were reported upon for the first time. It soon became apparent that the presence of our machines over this territory caused the enemy
