Mainz
Got into Mainz from Wiesbaden early and went down to the Quai and got aboard H.M.M.L 519 Lt R . As part of a flotilla we cast off and steamed down the Rhine. General Mangin was going to Cologne escorted by a French and part British flotilla and we were the advance guard. It was a lovely sunny morning and the whole day voyage to Cologne is one to live in memory forever. At many parts bodies of French troops were drawn up and received us with the salute of presenting arms bugles etc. In one place we got a salute of guns. The River is lovely and the high banks are a mass of cultivation. The Banks are all marked with kilometre signs in white stone ? a great idea. Passed Johannesberg
