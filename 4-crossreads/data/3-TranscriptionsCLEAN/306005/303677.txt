31-12-16Sun 31stWas hauled out at 3.15 this morning as the Adj. (Capt Weir) came over to the lines & could not find the horse picket. Foster was on & I found him between the blankets & put him under open arrest & went back to bed, we all slept cold till "Stand to Arms" at 5 oclock; made tea at 6.30 & were ready for the return trip at 8 oclock.
