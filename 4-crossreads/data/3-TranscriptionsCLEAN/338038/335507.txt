  
 38th Battery Australian Field Artillery France   11/7/18 
 Dear Mr Garling, Will you accept my very deepest sympathy about poor old Terry.  As a "brother" battery commander - he had the 37th - & I the 38th  - I would like to express my admiration of him & to say how much I personally miss him.  I think it is safe to say, he was the most popular chap in the Brigade & as for his Battery well they just worshipped him.
