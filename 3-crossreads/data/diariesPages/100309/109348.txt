20/5/17 Bouzaincourt 
Sunday. All day in the little church were special services and tomorrow the local folk make one of their excursions to the cemetery. Battalion formed up at 8.40 and marched headed by band to Church Army hut where was held a most enthusiastic service. The little padre preached a fine sermon. Hymns were accompanied by piano and clarionet. The National Anthem was played on the piano at the end and was rather amusing as some flourishes were introduced. Marched home the band playing well. Inspected all the billets and found them very good on the whole except for a few where pump water, soaking through heated fumiers, invaded the billets. Some of the cooks have their cookers and themselves looking very fine. Today the cooks prepared nettles and dandelions and they are said to be quite good and palatable. After lunch walked in the garden at the Chateau and had a long French conversation with Monsieur who is equally keen to learn English. Played with the dear little girl Chretienne Eloi who is in fair way
