<p>from Fritz, he might have vanished for all he's doing, but the brute will break out any time I suppose. I then lay on the bottom of the wet, clayey trench &amp; slept again; oh, its a lovely war! Well I slept, off &amp; on, in my little narrow bit of trench all through the day, until at 5 p.m,, as it was beginning to get dark, our work commenced again, ration carrying. Went down in parties to the Crucifix as usual, &amp; the limbers brought along stew &amp; tea in big thermos dixies &amp; petrol tins. One thing the tucker is kept up well. The party I was with carried to A Coy. We got back to our pozzy, had our own hot stew &amp; tea which was glorious, &amp; got into the trench. Gee whiz! didn't Fritz pour in the shells then, it was a God-send our trip was finished. They fell thick &amp; fast round where Shortland &amp; I were huddled up in our narrow trench. It's an awful sensation as they roar just outside your parapet, &amp; you can hear the shriek of another coming, &amp; wonder if it will get you. A hole about 9 yards round I afterwards saw 3 yards outside where I sat in the trench. Jagged bits of iron fell on our parados &amp; in the trench &amp; it was a very near thing. Later in the night, as I'll tell, he gave us even a hotter &frac14; of an hour. Our guns opened on him, &amp;  there was a continuous shriek of our shells passing through the air over to him. Sgt Purcell is a very brave chap, he is walking about from post to post with orders, &amp; seeing things</p>
