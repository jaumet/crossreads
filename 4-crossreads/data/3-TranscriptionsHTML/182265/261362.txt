<p><u>28/8/17</u> - In dugout in Owl Trench near Gapard Farm, Messines.</p>
<p>I have just returned from Ration Carrying. We had a very lively time as Fritz evidently saw our Mule train coming over the ridge in the Moon light &amp; gave us shells &amp; machine gun fire hitting two mules but luckily missing my party.</p>
<p>We deepened our trench during the past few days, revetted &amp; drained a good deal of it. Last night we were carrying kneedeep in water for a considerable distance but our draining &amp; duckboarding today made our track fairly dry for tonight. A captain &amp; Corporal of - - have just been making preliminary arrangements for taking over from us tomorrow night.</p>
