  FRANCE . 
  February 1918 . 
 DEAR PEOPLE, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I am on the same old job as before, &quot;Scout Officer&quot; it suits me for very few officers know anything about N.M.L. and I am usually left to do my little job without interferences, of course were it done other than well, I would hear about it, but as it is I work out my little game as I will and &quot;Nobuddy sez nuthink to me. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In a few days time I set off for a week&#39;s instructing, a British Brigade has requested my services and so away I go again.&nbsp; What an awful thing I&#39;ll have to join the police when I return and raid Chow Betting joints for excitement.&nbsp; Anyhow it&#39;s an appreciation and a compliment and shows that past work must have been good.&nbsp; I&#39;ll send you a copy of their request when enough time has passed to make it innocuous. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Major Hurry is one of the most considerate men alive, he is very hardworking and brave too, he delights in sharing the boys&#39; perils and the boys realize this and call him &quot;The Old Prince.&quot; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I can think of nothing else of general interest for a semi-public letter. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; BEST WISHES, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAROLD.
