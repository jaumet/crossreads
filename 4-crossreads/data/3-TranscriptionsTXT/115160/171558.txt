 Dear Lock, 
 I&#39;ve sent you two registered envelopes care of the Crown St Post Office with four sets of cards. &nbsp;I hope you get them safely. &nbsp;I think you will be taken on with them. &nbsp;Today has been mild, but we manage to get our brazier going all the same. 
 There&#39;s nothing to mention, I hope you are well and having plenty of business. 
 Fondest regards, 
 Your loving Cousin, 
 Jim Drummond
