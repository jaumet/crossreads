  
 fellow.  His company thought the world of him & are very rattled at present.  B Coy. has had the brunt of it in officers, N.C.Os & men.  However the day is not far distant when we will claim our revenge. Col Lamrock will tell you more about it.  He is very proud of his C.B.  May he live long to [indecipherable] it.  He is one of the finest old men I have ever met.  He deserves a right good reception.  Lts Francis & Barlow are the only two wounded officers, not yet returned to duty.  They may be back any day now.  Capt. Raper who was absent temporarily suffering from shell shock will return tomorrow, I believe.  Report has it that I will not remain as C.O. of the 20th , but will be sent to Divisional Headquarters staff.  I will be sorry to leave those gallant lads, but cannot miss such a chance.  Besides I must go where I am sent. Kind regards to Mrs R. & Committee. Sincerely yours, R.F. FitzGerald
