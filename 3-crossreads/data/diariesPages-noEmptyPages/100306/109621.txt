E Camp Bernafaye Wood Needle Tr 
22/12/16 Awakened early and roused up the doctor for being late on his sick parade. No good keeping sick men about in the cold. Moved off at 11.45 and had a good run through in spite of heavy traffic. The heavy early morning rain had made the roads slushy and gangs of men were busy with brooms and scrapers cleaning them. Thousands of vehicles and horses coming and going in ceaseless chains. Reached the huts as yesterday and put the men into them ploughing through a sea of mud up to the knees in places. Met Pedler and had a short yarn and then set out for Needle Trench walking along duckboards all the way. Passed an old factory ? a mass of tangled iron and some huge old boilers. Noticed a German grave with a cross painted on it and afterwards saw a German prisoner being marched down under guard wearing his big steel helmet. Plugged along over barren shell pitted
