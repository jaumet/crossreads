They sent their sons to college and paid for an expensive education for them, but how much did a lot of them learn.    it was too much [indecipherable] [indecipherable] they were good at Footer or Rowing Cricket etc. but everywhere else a number of them were failures the ones who came out as successes, were those who had to Battle for their living either, with their brains or hands so they had to work.   now the war is making a lot of them think, but it is from amongst the ones who had to work that some of their best men are coming.   the others are not up to much  they are rather good at doing nothing except talk at the Club.   Things were rather pleasant here for Xmas.   a certain amount of leave was granted but the men were not allowed to travell on the Railway, the authorities had some fool Idea in their heads, soldiers must not travell, presumably because the train service was altered and there was a shortage in Rolling stock, yet, every paper advertised the Xmas Holiday Resorts, and Holiday makers seemed to be enjoying themselves as usual \"but soldiers must stay in Camp for Xmas.   one man told me that, leave was only granted Xmas week in extreme cases such as sickness at home and then two days only.   I am speaking of men who have relatives on this side of the world.   But the Issuing of orders forbidding troops to travell on the trains did not deter a few of them from going.   I do not blame them.   I did once.   But now Good luck to the man who beats them, and gets away.  I had my Photo taken sometime ago here in Wareham but I do not like it much however everyone seems to consider that it is a first class likeness, perhaps that is why I do not care for it   I am sending a couple out, also some that I had taken when at Wallington.   I am also sending Madge one.   She is as you know the W.A. Lassie I have not heard from her for some time.   When you see Aunt Nellie again will you please thank her for her Card allso Ivy for her letter I will write as soon as possible, but writing in these huts is far from pleasant as the Tables are nearly allways in use.   men playing cards etc. and they make writing quite a task.  When up at Wallington I went out for several walks sometimes with Harold.   sometimes with Mrs. Horton and once with Elsie &amp; once with Edgar.   But I did not go up to Lunnon to see the sights, Lunnon in winter does not appeal to me any it's a dreary sort of place, especially when it rains.   I mean, you know what I mean so I wont explain.   I was advised once to see the Tower and Bridge, but I have heard so much about them that they have lost interest for me no doubt I would enjoy seeing them but somehow when I go to any of those sort of places by myself I always start wishing that someone else was there with me and they I begin to lose Interest in them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a6373120\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 120]<br><br />\nseen Harry yet.
