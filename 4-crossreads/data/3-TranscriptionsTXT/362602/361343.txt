2nd Day after Sailing
(1915)At SeaOn same ship as we left Port by.
Dear Dad, Mother & George,
We are having glorious weather & the Pacific (Peaceful) Ocean is calmer than Sydney Harbour.  We have been able to see the coast all the time & some of it is very nice but most of the coast line is rugged hills & cliffs.  There are numerous light houses all along the coast & this morning we sighted an island on the Port bow about 10 miles out to sea.  We have passed a number of ships passing northward but although this is a very slow packet nothing has passed us yet.  I suppose the Suevic will soon catch us up.  There were numerous birds flying round the ship last night & many gulls rested
