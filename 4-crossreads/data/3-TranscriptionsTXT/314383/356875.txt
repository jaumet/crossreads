May 20Old Scotty & I had a look thro the bazaar with Zillaman as a sort of guide.  The place is much the same as Kermanshah, tho here there is a Jewish quarter, with better shops & more up to date goods, which come via the Caspian.  Poverty and  starvation is just as rampant & Stalky has people on the job of famine relief. One meal a day is given to the people on road work & the surplus distributed to the people.  It is said that a particular party calling themselves Democrats are right up against us on a/c of saving the rabble, as they term these people from starvation.
May 21Paid a visit to the American Missionary quarter.  Dr. Funk & his wife are apparently head of the show.  They live in a rather nice sort of bungalow
