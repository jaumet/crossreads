Carlton camp: dull cold day: up about 8am: there were over 100 cases of trench feet etc to be taken away so we had a busy time taking them down: Poole, Hatton Roberts got away: after dinner the Doctor came round we all had "complaints" a fair few more got away: I am crook but can't raise a temperature: fair few planes kicking around heavy mist after tea: Fritz put a few shells close by after we turned in: there has been a good few heavy bombardments lately Fritz must be having a pretty rough time as well as us:

Carltom camp: dull cold day: up about 8am: had a parade to see our strength: our casualties for the Coy was three off, forty others while in the trenches our strength now is fifty six effectives so I hope we don't have too rough a time in to night: We are out of action is the latest so are not going up tonight: plenty of balloons ?planes up as usual some good duals: packed up moved off to Mametz: pretty tired when we got there so slept well: heavy bombardment on : the mud is getting a little harder but is more stickier to march along in
