machines, after all I had heard & read about them, they are a most peculiar shape something like an egg only the angles are more acute, something after this style [small drawing] the little strokes are where the machine guns or 6 lbs are placed, the whole concern likes lies flat on the ground & is moved along caterpillar fashion for it is almost covered with an endless chain of grips & these are driven by motors inside the machine, they are ponderous affairs & nothing but a direct hit from a shell would stop them for they are all steel, a proper land "Dreadnought" inside one of them was the charred remains of 2 men, it looked to me as if the shell had set the petrol tank alight & they had been burnt to death, from a distance a "Tank" looks somewhat like a threshing machine with the wheels off.  We passed any amount of dead men on the way up both ours & German, these were all killed in the last charge when Flers was taken
