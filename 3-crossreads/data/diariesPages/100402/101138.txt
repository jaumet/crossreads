Many men leave this week for Australia on a six months furlough stunt. Lucky beggars.
The 1st Aust. Division now holds two records, 1. holding the line continuously for about 130 days, (2) the record for the greatest numbers of guns prisoners captured in one day by one division.

A walk this afternoon to Tincourt over the hills. A small stunt is coming off in the morning then the Division comes out for a good long spell.
