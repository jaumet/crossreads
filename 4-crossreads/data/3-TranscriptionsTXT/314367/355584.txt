 I lunched &amp; went to the beach &amp; to Anthony's &amp; did my own &ndash; 2 white suits &ndash; 2 white shoes 4/6 per pair leather soled &ndash; cheap &amp; good when well whitened &ndash; Helmet &ndash; Several other small things &amp; then I had finished &ndash; I dined &amp; to my room &amp; reread in the SMH the tale of the Sydney &amp; Emden &ndash; you should get Rawdon to read that aloud &ndash; I know the Sydney &amp; some of the officers. We had a naval dinner on the Upolu at Rabaul &ndash; The Emden put up a good scrap but a hopeless one against a superior class of vessel &ndash; It's curious that no other ship came up &amp; chipped in for they were all on the same job of convoy &ndash; Australian troops in Egypt &ndash; not quite good enough yet for Europe &ndash; The spring will see them fit &ndash; My idea of England as the cause &ndash; indirectly &ndash; of war shows up even here &ndash; you can't get even the best men in Australia ready for European warfare under months &amp; months of training &amp; during that time the strain on our few veteran troops must be enormous &ndash; The Encounter is off Garden Island &ndash; Destroyers &amp;  Una gone out &amp; we follow &ndash; Rabaul is I think our place &ndash; We've no war news here on Garden Island &ndash; Well now dear I think things are pretty right for you at G.I. &ndash; I hope your cheque has come.
