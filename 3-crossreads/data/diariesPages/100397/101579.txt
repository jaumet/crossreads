Dear Mother
Since writing you Last, I have moved from Hos. to Base. arrived here only a few days ago and found the place very much altered, Since I left it in May. last. A fine Cinema hall, has been erected, the Army Chappel completed. it is a fine roomy building and is partitioned so that one portion can be used through the week as a reading writing and recreation room. and the other portion can Still be used as a church, for daily service. Ornamental arches, I suppose to train some creeper on eventually have been erected, and round the Officers quarters gardens have been made, next spring the place should look quite nice.. It is altered also in other ways, along the road in front is a fine avenue of Tall Poplars. when I was here in May they were nice and green, now they are bare and leafless. The banks, that were so gay with wild flow?rs, are covered now with dying bracken and dead leaves, no flow?rs
