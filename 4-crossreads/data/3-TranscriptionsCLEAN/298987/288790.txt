  
 Waterproof & well fed. This is our main camp for Reinforcements coming to France about 5 miles from Le Harve 
 Saturday 27th Revalie at 5 30 & had to turn out for a Roll Call Spent a streneous morning going through Gass  Must have walked between 6 & 7 miles as the Officer in charge got lost for a time. Went through a Gass chamber Lectures Gass Drill etc & walked about 1/2 a mile with Masks on. When every thing seemed to be finished as we were lined up ready to move off & as it was quite dinner time were getting very impatient when a gass alarm was given several Smoke Bombs were let of to windward & before we could adjust our Masks the dense smellie smoke was all over us - It was harmless of course but is showed clearly how necessary it was to allways have your Mask ready when near the line Reached camp at 11 PM & were warned to be ready at 6 to move to the line.
