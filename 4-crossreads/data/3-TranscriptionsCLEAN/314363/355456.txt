We moved into supports on the night of the 24th, our head quarters were in a pill box, which had been captured a few days before. The Ypres battleground is a far more desolate looking place than what the Somme was. After leaving the main road, we very soon found ourselves on a corduroy road which had a fair amount of traffic, mostly ammunition trains, of motor wagons & mules, the motors carry shells for the large guns, & the mules the eighteen pounders, which have to go within a few hundred yards of the front line, mules do splendid work. Along these corduroy roads on each side are parts of broken motors, limbers & dead mules & horses, the dead animals are more in evidence as we go forward, after a while we turned off onto a duckboard path, this stretches across country in a wavy line, around shell holes. The first time in, our btn. was in a captured pill box, taken by the Australians
