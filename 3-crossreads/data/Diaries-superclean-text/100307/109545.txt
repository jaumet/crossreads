into a little restaurant in Boulevard St Michel and had an excellent lunch of fish, meat and vegetables bread and cream with a demi-bouteille of Bordeaux rouge for 6 francs. The wine here is excellent. Many French officers in here for lunch.

In this street is a building with a fountain or cascade forming one side of it. The water forms a fall right down the wall and cascades into a large basin. Thence to the Sorbonne or University which is not unlike that of Edinburgh and surrounded with booksellers shops stocked with text books of all kinds. A small Russian quarter up this way. The Church of the Sorbonne is a rather bare looking place and chiefly remarkable for the tomb of Richelieu. It is a wonderful group of statues done in alabaster-like stone. Above it, hangs from a rope the Cardinals red hat now much dust covered. The old scristan sold me
