<p>22 Feb. 1869</p>
<p>My dear Arthur<br/>I send you Kerr's letters which you wished to have. I also send you with this a packet containing Amy's present of a pocket compass. Let me know early that it has safely come to hand.</p>
<p>"Empress" is to tear off positively on Saturday next 27th, &amp; I expect [indecipherable] will on Sunday be heading Sea-wards. &ndash;</p>
<p>We only recd. yours of 19th. As your horse was poor it is perhaps as well that you did not go to Cathkin to run any risk of falling between two stools. But when the horse is able, the Moorabbie manager wd. probably consent to let you go over &amp; see the other, without prejudice to your position with <u>him</u>. You will yourself be the best judge of this.</p>
<p>I can only breathe my earnest prayer &ndash; "The Lord be your guide."</p>
<p>Your loving Father</p>
<p>[The following text is written across top of page]<br/>Any letter for Amy must be here by <u>Monday next</u> for the mail.</p>
