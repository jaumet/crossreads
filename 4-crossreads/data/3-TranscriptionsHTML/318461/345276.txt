<p>Saturday 19/5/17<br/>my prediction was correct it was a lively night shelled us with heavies for 5 hours &amp; came mighty close to my Posi. Lt. Jimmie Kerr was killed Sergt Jack Nelson wounded &amp; many others its time they came to their senses &amp; moved us out of this death trap.<br/>The Boys took 3 days Rations so as not to have to come out for them every night.<br/>fine but cloudy &amp; chilly, during all the 5 hrs Bombt. last night our guns never replied with a shot. 'Why' I wonder.<br/>Planes very busy this morning, can't find Fritzs big guns tho. here for another 7. days yet, we <u>must</u> be the only army in France, every road you go &amp; every track is marked with Blood, smashed helmets &amp; Rifles &amp; equipment if Fritz is getting it as the Papers say he is, what must it look like on his side. I shall be more than thankful when we get out of this &amp; still more so <u>when</u> I get my leave<br/>Just watching some of our Planes when first one &amp; then another began to fall turning over &amp; over from Tail &amp; head then over sideways. thought they were gonners but bless you  they were giving us an exhibition &amp; for cool front they were the limit, almost over Fritzs lines too it's bucked us up wonderfully for if thats their opinion of Fritz &amp; they can see him, enough said.<br/>Pay 19/1 &pound;25.14 0</p>
<p>Sunday 20/5/17<br/>another quiet night thank goodness<br/>slight Rain &amp; mist also this morning hot &amp; fine<br/>saw great Plane fight just now as far as I could see none came down but it was a great sight &amp; just over head they looked just like giant birds wheeling &amp; diving, flying sideways &amp;</p>
