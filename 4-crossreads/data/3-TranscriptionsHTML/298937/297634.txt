<p>camp at Anzac.<br/>5th Div. (Sgt Derbyshire's &ndash; late of 1st A.G.H.) have taken over hospital, but I fancy it will not be for long, as we are leaving the boat at Marseilles.<br/>We may go overland to England or just stay in France.<br/>Am getting rather excited at the prospect of seeing Dad &amp; Lily soon.  Not nearly as excited as the occasion warrants however;  my capacity is much smaller now.<br/>Leaving Egypt I feel that my stay on there has not been at all to my benefit.</p>
