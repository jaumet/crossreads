  
 look after & do my bidding.  It is quite the worst & most worrying job I have had yet & I shall have to get nasty. 
 I had a note from Joe Kirby the other day.  I expect he wrote you & told you of his brother Bob's death. 
 I really must fly as the man is leaving with mail &c.  I'm so sick of writing you scrappy disconnected letters but I hope you will understand.  I'm still well & healthy but too busy to worry whether I'm unhappy or not. 
 My love to the Boss & Graham, Mac & very much to yourself my dear friend.  You are a brick.  The sweater is just great.  I'm dying to get back home. 
 So long, Wilkie.
