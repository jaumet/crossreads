  
 13 July 1918 Saturday (X to X crossed out) Life goes on much as usual Wiring every night & a good many F.G.C. Martials by day. X I feel sure climatic conditions etc have a lot to do with latter & I remember how an officer often feels & he is better fed & gets more sleep than the o/ ranks.  I wonder how Joe will stand it    one thing as a Soldier he gets good attention medically. X Killed 2 Scorpions under my Blanket this morning, they live in the stones with their friends Centipedes & triantulas. We get many rumours about an attack but personally I don't think they will: too HOT.
