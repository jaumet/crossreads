16th Fairly quiet night all along the line. Heavy fireing down at Cape Hellas, heard they were making another attack on "Achi-Baba". Turkish Artillery try to bring down naval observation balloon at Suvla Bay but again fail. Our Howitzers shell enemys trenches on our front this afternoon. More fighting out towards Salt lake, Turks appear to have upper hand holding all important positions. 3 of our lads wounded this afternoon. Some of the 14th Battln sunk a well near Olive grove and struck good water.
17th Everything much quieter last night. Turk snipers doing lots of damage again, had 2 of my section both Brothers, killed early just after daybreak ("Darky" Harry Rice") fine brave fellows. Bill Curtis was shot through the jaw while having a nap, and Cpl Kay shot through the right shoulder, taken to dressing station. Very difficult job getting killed and wounded out of firing line, owing to narrowness. A German aeroplane flew over our trenches this afternoon and dropped 2 bomb,s and lots of steel darts, but all fell in front of our lines. One of our "Planes" took after the "Taube" which went off at a great speed, easily escaping from our machine. Sickness claiming many of our lads.
