<p>All leave stopped.</p>
<p>Troops moving off to the front in high spirits, those not moving off are very disappointed.  Animated scenes are being enacted. The bands are marching past playing inspiriting music and cheer after cheer is being raised as the battalions march away, to, no one except the heads know where.  It is very galling to be left behind.</p>
