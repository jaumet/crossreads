  
 thought so much of by others outside his own family circle and I can assure you it will be a great grief to Eldon if he survives to hear it. 
 Killed in the noble cause of right & justice, (which must prevail) in defence of his King & Country, he has passed the bar to his reward - my heart is too full to write & I break down at each attempt to continue - 
 We all truly & deeply sympathise with you and may the great, good and everlasting God comfort you all in your sorrow, 
 Yours very sincerely James Moran
