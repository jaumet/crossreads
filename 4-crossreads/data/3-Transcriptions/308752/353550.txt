<p>that a satisfactory decision will come of it. What is the use of this slaughter &amp; destroying of the country which goes on day after day?  It is all very well for the people safe at home, to talk to the Soldier of "King &amp; Country" and "Honour" &amp; Death for Liberty, &amp; all the rest of the <u>glories</u> of War. All these may, perhaps, satisfy the people at home, &amp; the Warriors in the War office, &amp; some soldiers issue orders at the base, but the man who has seen his mates killed, &amp; has seen the ghastly scene of a battlefield etc., combined with the awful suffering of men &ndash; he requires something more real or definite, than long winded sentences &amp; promises of Glory etc.,    After being nearly three years on Active Service, I have come to the conclusion that there is <u>no Glory in War</u>.</p>
<p>I hope you will all excuse the above "out burst" but, it is the mood I am in to day. Sad news to hand two members of the 8th were killed to-day.  Dvr. Saunders, W.  &amp; Pte Howarth. The former was an original member of the Unit.</p>
<p>5th May 1918.<br/>"Hurrah!" Our relief turned up at 6 p.m. another squad from C. Section came out to take our place. It did not take me long to reach our Headquarters at the factory, where I enjoyed a refreshing hot bath. The next few days I had rather an easy time, enjoyed a good rest. Very frequently Fritz's planes flew over our home but luckily for us, no damage was done in our vicinity. On the night of the 7th inst. a concert was held in the factory by one of the Battalions in our Division, those men of the Ambulance who were at Hd. Qtrs. were invited. The show was a splendid one, the roar of the Artillery, from mid-night to the early hours of the morning was terrific, &amp; the news in the morning was good.</p>
<p>The enemy attempted to counter attack, but failed in his efforts.  Judging from the roar of the bombardment I guessed that something of the kind was on.</p>
