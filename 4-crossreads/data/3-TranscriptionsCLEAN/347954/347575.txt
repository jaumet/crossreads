various C.O. but a great number unfortunately, will never know of their achievements having many weeks back gone to a soldiers grave.
A good number of days have gone since last I wrote but as a repetition of many days havoc would be constantly on the screen I have given myself a short rest with the hopes of better results.  I made a sojourn through the various trench villages & was much impressed with the various improvements, especially on the R.U.W.  Here after clambering through yards & yards of sun baked chambers I finally found myself in a disused sap which soon led me into an underground apartment, bomb, shell, & bullet proof - it also had the great advantage of being cool & airy.  The same style of trenches I believe were used by the Japanese in their war with Russia.  Proceeding leisurely foward you meet alternatively steps which enable you to peer over into the enemies quarters also man, or air-holes.  The boys on duty here were as happy as the proverbial "Larry" & as the Engrs. were still engaged continuing the work foward of original lines we shall have soon something quite important to guard on this wing.  Today the fifty second of our life in Eden & the 15/6/15 ordinarily finds us in a peaceful mood & wondering how things will go on this anniversary
