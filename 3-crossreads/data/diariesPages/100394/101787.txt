All land is now out of sight and we are in the middle of the Meditterranan. It is beginning to work up rough tonight

January 8
Arrived in Alexandria harbour this afternoon Had a bad bout of seasickness this morning but am alright again now. There is nothing much to see in the harbour and one can’t see much of the City from here. I should like to have a look round but I don’t expect to say here at all, and we don’t event know our destination

January 9
Disembarked about 11 a.m. this morning and entrained almost immediately hoping for Cairo but we were sadly disappointed. We passed through Zaq-a-Zig and arrived here (Tel-el Kebir) about 7.30 p.m. We had some tea of a sort and then pitched our tent.

January 10
We got our Xmas mail today and had day off to rest. I got about 20 letters and numbers of cards. Our parcels haven’t arrived yet but a number of cases are in Cairo for us and I suppose will turn up in a day or two.
