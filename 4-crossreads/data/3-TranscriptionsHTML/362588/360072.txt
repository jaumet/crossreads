<p>In the Red Sea<br/>8 June 1915</p>
<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>Am doing splendidly although the heat has been very bad the last few days.  The Censor is allowing dates &amp; places to be used so can tell you about all we know ourselves.  We arrived at Colombo on the morning of Sunday 30 May and all the men were allowed to go ashore, not on leave, but by detachments, &amp; marched through the town and round by the ocean beach back to the barracks.  At the barracks they had a spell and a pint of beer each.  This latter was very much appreciated.  The heat was something awful but the marching was excellent.  There were practically no white men to be <strike>available</strike> seen in the town.  I think they must sleep all day on Sundays, but the native population turned out in good force &amp; straggled along with us all through the march.  Each detachment was ashore for about 3 hours and I am sure all the men greatly appreciated the privilege of being allowed ashore especially as they had been told</p>
