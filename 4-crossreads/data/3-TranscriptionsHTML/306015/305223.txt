<p>June 18.   Discharged from Hospital this afternoon.   I travelled by the Red Cross motor to Albert &amp; thence proceeded on the back of a three-ton motor lorry to Bapaume and eventually found the Battalion about half a mile from that town.   The Second Divn.. is here as a third (?) line of defence, about 7 miles behind the front line.   We are camped in tents on the downs outside Bapaume across which Fritzie imshied whilst evacuating his front line some time back.    From here we can see the aeroplanes and observations balloons at the Line and at night we see the flares;  and cannon-flashes and can hear plainly the roar of the artillery.    At night especially things are generally pretty lively up that way, and one is apt to experience rather a queer sensation as a result.</p>
<p>June.  19.   It rained consistently in the morning and so there was no parade.   After dinner</p>
