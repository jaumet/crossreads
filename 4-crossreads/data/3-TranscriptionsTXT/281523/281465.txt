7/9/17 CampagneStayed in bed until late and sent Matthews out with the Battalion to the Training area.  Finished a Summary of Evidence and then got on to some office work rooting the place out pretty thoroughly and clearing out a lot of rubbish.  Stewart has a septic arm and seems generally unwell.  The arm is inflamed right up to the armpit and will take a while to heal. After lunch cleared up more arrears of work and did not set foot outside the Chateau grounds at all today.  During the evening received word of our move forward on the 12th  inst and had some French conversation with Marie & with Leon Barbier "un homme extraordinaire".  It is damned annoying missing Rome leave but cannot be helped.  General Paton has gone ahead to reconnoitre the line today. There was some rain today and the area for training was wet. After mess I lectured the officers on tactics up to date and several other minor points as brought to light by recent happenings.  It will be like leaving home going away from the happy little place.
