<p>every event went off.</p>
<p>Nov 5th<br/>The sea watery calm &amp; the weather is beginning to get hot the consequence being that an awning &amp; also a bath have been fixed up on the lower decks. The Osterley passed quite closejust about dusk. They were given a few cheers as they went by. They are very lucky to see the sight they seen in the boats all in a line making for Colombo.</p>
<p>Nov 9th<br/>We were still making slow progress to Colombo steaming about 250 miles per day. Today morning about 7 o'clock the cruiser Sydney was detached from the convoy to proceed to the vicinity of Cocos islands where a German Warship was seen. It appears that as soon as the German Cruiser exchanged a few shots with the Sydney, it stranded itself so as to avoid sinking. The Cruiser is believed to be the Emden. The British Casualties were 2 killed &amp; 13 wounded</p>
