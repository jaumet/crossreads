5th June 1916 
Left Durban this morning at 8 oclock. Roll call at 6 oclock. Very disappointed at not getting away to Durban for another day's "jolle". Heavy seas were on until late in the afternoon. Promises of a rough time to Capetown.
6th June 1916
Turned out a good day. Coast in sight all day. Lecture by our doctor on Gon. Syphs. A good sight today from the bow of the ship. Porpoises feeding on shoal fish, with dozens of birds feeding on them too. Then the porpoises made a bee line for the ship kept in front of the bow for some time. A very pretty sunset.
7th June 1916
A very rough day and a cold one. Mess orderly for day wrote letters for posting from Capetown. Passed a liner going north at 9.30 pm and signalled her. Passed Cape Lilleth at 2.30 oclock. Has a very good lighthouse. Tonight we pass Cape or Pt Danger where the "Birkenhead" was wrecked. News of Kitcheners death from liner.
8th June 1916
Lights of Capetown in sight when we woke up 6 oclock. Heavy rolling round the Cape althrough the night could not sleep. Fooled about Table Bay till 930 when we tied up at wharf. Left ship at 11 oclock and went into Capetown by train. Posted letters to Sydney. Had dinner at Maxims Adderley Street. Capetown not a bad place, but we struck it on a very wet miserable day. Took a tram ride to Observatory came back by train. Had afternoon tea finished up by motor ride to ship (4.30). No leave for the night on account of troops drunk. Still in harbour at 1030 when I went to sleep. Shipped a 14lb gun aboard.
