<p>31/8/17 Campagne<br/>In spite of rain marched out to the parade ground and there took up a defensive position against the 21st who attacked the full length of the ground.  After the operation criticised it with all the officers and made them do the same with the men.  After lunch we attacked against the 21st following a preliminary rally by dud Stokes'.  Formed up then and marched home.  Ploughing has commenced &ndash; the earth is just free of its crop.  The French people have a rumour that we are leaving next Tuesday and strangely both General Smyth &amp; Col Bridges mentioned similarly the matters!  It is remarkable how such information gets round.  An officer of the Historical branch called to see me re our history of the regiment.  Very beautiful here today as the rain has washed the air very yellow and the buildings &amp; towers of stone stand out very plainly and are wonderfully near from first appearances.</p>
