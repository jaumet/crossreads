<p>to share in their pride &ndash; that I cannot refrain from writing to express to you my sincerest sympathy in the loss you have suffered through your son's self-sacrifice.  Our Honour List already includes a large number who have laid down their lives for the Cause, and among them your son was not the least promising.  I had not seen him for some time previous to my visit to Liverpool Camp, and I was very struck with his quiet, confident demeanour.  To lose such a son is indeed a heavy blow.</p>
<p>With feeling of deepest sympathy,<br/>Believe me,<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>T.A.H. Wing</p>
