Have been issued from Quartermaster's store with 3 prs. socks & 1 pr. puttees - the first re-issue of clothing since enrolment; but at same time not exactly necessary - have plenty of togs, pretty complete outfit. Issued with khaki helmet with blue &  back  black diamond shaped cloth badge on side. Seems to be an Imperial idea to do away with the slouch hat. Went in to town to-night with "Snow" Freeman for a couple of hours. On return wrote a couple of Scout letter - and then feeling snoozy-woozy Off to bed.
