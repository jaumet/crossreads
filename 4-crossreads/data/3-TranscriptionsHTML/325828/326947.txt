<p>One thing about it though.  It seems to get away or dry up very quickly in these parts.<br/>I received a letter from Ol from Colombo today which I will answer next week.  I see that there is a mail closing in a week's time (on June 29th) for Australia so that I will be able to get another letter off to you 'tween this &amp; then, all being well.<br/>There is very little news of interest in these parts.<br/>The people with whom I am billeted at present have a pair of rabbits in a hutch affair   They think the world of them</p>
