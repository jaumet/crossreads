 Many thanks for your letters of Xmas Day. Also papers which come regularly to hand.I am so thankful to hear you are still keeping well &ndash; Also have had letters from Pat up to Dec 20th &ndash; We are still plugging away here getting fit as fast as possible. Don't think I told you we have a new O.C. in this Battery. Major C.G.A.Miles who came away as Capt &amp; Adjutant of the 2nd F.A.Brigade &amp; got his promotion on the Peninsula. He was originally of the permanent Field Artillery in Melbourne and is a rattling good chap &amp; knows his job thoroughly. 
 Had a letter from Ath Cochrane yesterday. He is in camp at Heliopolis waiting to join his Battalion. Cairo is very dead now. Have been up again on leave since I last wrote
