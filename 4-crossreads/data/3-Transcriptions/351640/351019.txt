<p>to report badly about me. He told me that my being sent to Anzac was a high compliment the reward for work well done under trying circumstances, that he would value highly being sent himself, and that he had some other work for me to do when I returned which would not be very long. I thanked him for the assistance he and his staff had always given to me.</p>
<p>Jerom &amp; I had a pleasant trip from Cairo to Alexandria. He is having a day off 'mongst some soldier friends at Mustapha. He likes that best because he can smoke &amp; do other things which he likes &amp; which he does not care to do when he is with me. After dinner last night I took him for a long walk midst the streets &amp; byeways of the city, he became very tired, finally I had to get a garry to bring him home. I am not sure that he feels enthusiastic about crossing the Mediterranean Sea. However he feels he will have to see the business through now.</p>
<p>In case anything happens to me you will find everything in good order. What ever befalls I shall be happy in the thought that <strike>midst</strike> 'mongst you girls there will be many a kind thought for a p. o. m. God bless you all. This is but a supplement to my earlier posted letter.</p>
<p>Many many happy days to each for many many more years<br/>Heaps of love and loads of kisses from your loving &amp; affectionate father<br/>John B. Nash.</p>
