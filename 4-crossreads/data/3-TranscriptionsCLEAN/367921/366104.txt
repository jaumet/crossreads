smuggled into us by the Russian orderly looking after the gaol,  and whom for his services received food, things would have gone  very hard with us.           On two occasions during the fourteen days, per medium of a small piece of soap, I managed to get up to the English Barracks, eat as much as I could hold, and return with food and  cigarettes for my pals.          Vermin were particularly had in these cells. The blankets and mattresses were swarming with fleas and lice, and . I remember finding a dead mouse in one of the pockets of my |coat - he had probably been after crumbs in my pocket and had  met his end in being lain on in my sleep.          Every morning we received five minutes fresh air when we were taken out to wash etc.Under such conditions as these we were particularly  glad at the expiration of the fourteen days/ to receive our  limited freedom, for all told we had done six weeks gaol, and all the thought of our three pals by now probably in England - made us resolve to have another go for our liberty the first  chance that offered itself.
