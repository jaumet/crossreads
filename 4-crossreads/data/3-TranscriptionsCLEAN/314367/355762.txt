  
 name - thro his steward - on the beach we secured 3 extra bottles of whisky at 2/6 each (This was our own stuff sold & resold) We shall sell it tot by tot to the mess & make a good profit on each bottle - No other incident occurred save that on passing Matusi point where a battery is being erected we waved our pocket handkerchiefs to some friends & Fitz reproved us - saying it was orderless - No one said anything but we cursed him afterwards for a silly blighter full of gin & whisky up to his top waistcoat button - Really I think it was silly of him - I got up on the poop & had a last lingering look at Rabaul - It was absolutely empty save for the Una - Both town & harbor are deserted - The blight & curse of war is on them & there is nothing doing - I've had some real good times in Rabaul but I don't want to see it again - in the torrid summer -
