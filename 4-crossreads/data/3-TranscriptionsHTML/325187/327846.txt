<p>Sergeant  Weir is buried near the Monastery I spoke of visiting a few days ago.  The Coptic Priest was anxious he should be buried very close to the walls of the Monastery "Have then a better chance "of resurrection" &amp; more pay to the Priest- The nearer the Monastery the dearer the grave from 4d to 6d according to distance.<br/>However we have now a portion of ground set apart for the Soldiers &amp; are erecting a nice Memorial Stone for the poor chaps   I remember one grave at ANZAC on which was written in indelible Pencil on Wooden cross the two words CARRY ON.</p>
