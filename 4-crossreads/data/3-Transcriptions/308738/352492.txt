<p>August 7 Saturday 1915<br/>Working all day feeling much stronger, met Sgt Long &amp; was told that Lieu Robson was killed on 24th Jul.  Poor old "Robbie"the last last words he said to me before leaving,  was  "God bless you my boy"I hope you will soon get well. Little did we think that would be the last handshake on Earth. He was a "true man"so fond of home &amp; wife &amp; little ones. His face shone as he spoke of the happy times of the past &amp; he looked forward to meet those he loved again. I am reminded of the text</p>
