  
 nobody will be able to replace any losses sustained in our bodily health, no water or tar being used to stop the ill-effects of the wind.  If this Governement is not able to look after its internees then it should either give us proper work outside or let us return to the land of our birth.  With every breath & every bite at our meals we swallow samples of Australian soil & with it also the germs of all deseases wich science in all civilized countries is fighting to the utmost.  Hoping for your kind consideration & asking you to put this matter before the Consuls of Swizerland & Sweden as well as our commandant.  I am, yours faithfully A. Steinmetz, 72 Comp. Com. 18 Dec. 1917.  H. Just. Harvey, Off. Visi. Com. Camp, Judges Chamb., Sydn.  Sir, I am sorry to say that through accident, no opportunities was given to me to bring personally to your knowledge, the grievances voiced in my letter of the 28/11 & as I do not know when there will be the next opportunity to see you at our Camp, I beg to aknowledge the reciept of your letter of the 14th inst., & also to reply to a few of your remarks by means of these lines.  (a)  Although the complaints concerning the abudance of fat on mutton days hawe only been received from Comp. 39, 40, 41, 42, belonging to No. 3 Kitchen they are by no means only voiced by that part of the compound.  To many internees it seems idle to trouble about complaining, because often very  excess  evasive answers from different authorities are recieved & becourse there is allways a certain amount of inconvenience & even consequences of more unpleasant nature to be feared.  But you can rely on that one fact
