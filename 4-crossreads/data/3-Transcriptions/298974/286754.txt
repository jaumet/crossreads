<p>3<br/>He wished me to tell you he never felt so well in all his life and is feeling absolutely fit. But I feel too downhearted to give you any news ma dear; I just felt I had to write this; and yet I cant post it so that it will get you much before I arrive back. Still, I will add to it as news crops up and post it at, say Adelaide, just as the news of the trip. Good night all!</p>
<p>Well, this is the 30th. We expect to be in Adelaide in two days. I sent a telegram from W.A. Did you get it?</p>
<p>After leaving Suez I was transferred to Ward work as there was nothing doing in the Lab. The work is strennous and uninteresting: I have not done one dressing since I have been in the ward &ndash; and it is a surgical ward too. The sisters do it all. In Fremantle I got 9 letters and 7 papers and again topped the score. It's great to get letters I can tell you. Father is a brick to write like he does &ndash; they all contain just the news I want and I enjoy them very much. It makes me laugh though, for he <strike>allw</strike> always commences by saying he supposes I will never get this one, but I should think that, even tho' some are delayed, <strike>th</strike> I get all he sends, some even in duplicate. Colombo is just lovely.</p>
