 Saturday 30th [31] September [August] 1918 Laurie R. &amp; Laddie Lawton called 3.30 p.m. for me, 4 p.m. Mardi first then Helouan, then San Govanni's for 4 p.m. tea, took snaps for these boys (Mothers).  Nile looks very fine with the water spreading &amp; boats floating far up as far as one can see both ways. The glorious old Nile!  One can well believe the saying, He who once drinks of the Nile waters will always come back again to Egypt!.  It is a year today since I entered T'mba for the last time!  When again will I return!
