<p>Dec 20 2 Xmas Cards from Mother. Pleased to hear that Uncle Arth is OK again. All of us had to drill this afternoon. Barrys idea, &amp; hes a Tommy Lieut.</p>
<p>21 Drill again this morning &amp; breakfast at 6.30. Looks like a permanency. Extra heavy fog. Went out with Joe the K Nut last night, &amp; laughed nearly all the time. Drill all day.</p>
<p>22 Same old thing, form fours etc. Paid at B; went to Cairo had good time; Cinema etc. Believe Australians returning from Gallip. They are withdrawing from Suvla &amp; Anzac.</p>
<p>23 Damn the drill &amp; the mob wont refuse to drill although they talk enough. Went Cairo. Tea &amp; then Kursaal. Rather good acrobats.</p>
<p>24 <u>Xmas Eve</u> Cloudy &amp; cool. On QMs fatigue. Left for Cairo about 4 pm. Not many in streets &amp; nothing like Xmas Eve at home. Fairly heavy rain for about an hour or more. Hospitals will fare badly Desert sands are quit hard. [in margin] Xmas Eve</p>
<p>25 (Xmas Day)<br/>Service about 7.45 out in the desert. Short Sermon. Cairo in front &amp; Napoleons</p>
