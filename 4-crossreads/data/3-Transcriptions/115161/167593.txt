<p>a hurry to run away. I suppose they jolly well knew that we had something else to do but kill or chase them. One of these fellows - uninvited - took up his abode with us in our dug-out, and would eat our rations when we were away. I got quite fond of him. He would keep me company for hours while my pal was on fatigue duty during the night, and would sit up, or run all over me, he became quite tame and would let me stroke him. He made me go hungry more than once, but I liked him, he seemed so contented and happy, so sleek and fat, so lively and cheeky, I didn&#39;t mind him sitting on me but I objected to him taking a position on my forehead. When the slightest sound was heard approaching our dug-out, he would scoot back into his hole, at the head of my &quot;bed&quot;. I envied him in those days, I wished I could have been a rat, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The second night after our arrival, a dug-out a little way from ours was blown up by a shell, we never found any portion of the three men who were the occupants, A bit of ones paybook was later picked up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; About a mile or more from this camp of dug-outs, was a special set of trenches in course of construction, which included a very lare dug-out with a holding capacity of a battalion of men, and many smaller ones. Our duties were to assist in the competion of this special trench. We were divided into two parties, for this purpose. One party would start from&nbsp;&quot;home&quot; at 8 a.m. returning at 4.p.m., the other party would start at 6 p.m. returning at about 2 a.m. The manner in which we went to and came from that trench is I think worthy of mention.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I was for a time a member of the day party. We would leave the dugouts at about&nbsp;8 a.m. accompanied by an officer, and march single file to Flers, from here we had to cross a big tract of open country, which was under observation of the enemy, so to lessen the chance of many casualties, we left the shelter of a sunken road (this road with a high bank on either side) on the edge of Flers, two at a time. The officer would say, &quot;The next two go, and good luck, take my advice and don&#39;t dawdle&quot;. (He was a bit of a wag) there was no likelihood of our dawdling, we travelled as fast as the ice</p>
