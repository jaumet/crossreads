<p>Tuesday April 18th <br/>Cold wet day: revellie 5.30 am: breakfast: fell in &amp; went to trenches in parties of six: we were on engineers fatigue &amp; were demolishing a small bridge &amp; filling in under a parapet: Lock &amp; I were working &amp; a sniper got our position &amp; sent four shots before we made ourselves scarce: the mud &amp; water was very bad: met C Wilson &amp; C Brodie: a heavy bombardment is going on over armentieres way: had some cafe on the way back: the people here have orders to quit: the rumour is that a big offensive is to be made &amp; I suppose they do not want the people to be hit by return shells: went over the road &amp; got a stock of chocolates for the trenches: the place we were working in during the day was named "Oxford Circus" &amp; it was a circus to see the chaps slipping on the sliding board path: wrote to Ethel &amp; home:</p>
