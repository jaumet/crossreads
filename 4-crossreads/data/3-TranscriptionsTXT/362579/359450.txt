Nice cosy bedroom with a fire   &  as much coal as we like for 9d extra a week. Two in a room, good lights   &  very snug beds, also hot water   &  plenty of bathrooms. the food is excellent. Fresh milk, meat   &  vegetables - it is great after the awful food we had mostly in France.
This is the hospital for amputations. Oh, it is terrible to see some of the poor boys   &  they are all Australians. Some have both legs   &  an arm off - it is   too awful . Also have one eyed boys. So see plenty of glass ones. But you would be surprised to see how happy they are here. The sisters   &  in fact everyone connected with the hospital try to give them all a happy time. They are Bonzar boys, whistle, sing   &  laugh all day.
