<p>I went down to Woodford to Mrs. Limns again last Sunday afternoon again and they seemed very glad to see me.  I always enjoy a Sunday afternoon with them, as it is more like home to me than any other place I know, and it is a great change to get away from the hustle and bustle even for a few hours.<br/>I am keeping very well indeed, and the last few nights have been in bed by 8 o'clock and I sleep like a log.  I weighed myself a few days ago, and turn the scales at 12 st.2.  This is the heaviest I have ever been, so I don't think my operation has done me any harm.<br/>I must close now as there is no news of importance,<br/>With much love to all at "Cairnleith,"<br/>Your loving son,<br/>J Leo L Waterhouse</p>
