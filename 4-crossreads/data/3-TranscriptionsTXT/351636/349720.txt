 Dear Mr. Horsfield &ndash; Do you think you could assist Mrs. Wright with her [indecipherable] Bill &ndash; She applied some weeks ago but did not get assistance. I am trying to get her husband an invalid pension. She has 7 children at home, one too delicate to work the other 14 earns a few shillings but not regularly &ndash; It seems a rather distressing case as the husband at present is quite unfit for work. 
 You will have your own report but this bill is pressing otherwise she does not complain. 
 Yours faithfully B. Booth
