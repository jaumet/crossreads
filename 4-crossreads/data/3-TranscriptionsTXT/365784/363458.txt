[Extract from letters to the Editor, Egyptian Gazette]RED CROSS & Y.M.C.A.
To the Editor, "Egyptian Gazette."
Sir, - Re Australian Red Cross versus Egyptian Y.M.C.A. controversy, I venture to say that most, if not all, Australians think as "Australian Woman" does, especially the wounded. I contend that we should never have had to depend on outside kindness for the supply of comforts, which our Red Cross Fund was intended to provide, & well could.
I am, Sir,"A 2 months-bread-and jam-fed (up) Convalescent."
Alexandria, July 16.
