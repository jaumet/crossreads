Went into Cairo in the afternoon & visited Greek Scout Headquarters - The Greek Scouts are even more friendly than the British though they speak little English = Had tea at the Soldiers' Cafe & then with 2 young Egyptians as guides went out through Shoubra . Saw a pidgeon shooting match & then walked down to the Nile - Watched the fellaheen  making  cutting up straw & also had a good look at a Sakya which is used for watering the fields (as well as the shadouf) - Got back to Gezira about 9 p.m.
