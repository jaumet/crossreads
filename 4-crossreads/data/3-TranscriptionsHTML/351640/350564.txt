<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>Today the post received a letter from me in reply to yours written at Xmas time &amp; the end of December, with hope that they may reach you safely and in due course.  Others went to Mollie, Mr. Macdonald, Dr. Paton, and Dr. Peck.</p>
<p>The whole of today has been occupied with operations and ward work, but half an hour was devoted to walking to the top of the sand hill and back.  My fifty third operation since coming here was completed at 9.40 p.m., these are enough to keep one man occupied!  Dr. Grey has had almost as many.  One might not expect so much to happen mongst the men of a standing camp.</p>
<p>There are rumours that in the course of some weeks we shall be moving across the mediterranean sea, every one will be glad when we get a move on.  This place is right enough, yet we desire to reach Europe.</p>
<p>German Bill promised that yesterday he would make the seas around Britain a place of terror for all ships, perhaps he wont.  Whether or no it is not a genial or friendly threat to make, and it may be that some day the said Bill will be sorry.  I enclose for you rather a neat poem in French about him.  Let me hope that it will amuse you.  "La Navette".  My right arm is somewhat weary so good night to each of you.</p>

<p>21-2-15. When you see the Sphere of issue Janry 30 &ndash; 1915, and come to page 122, your eyes will light upon three photos of the part of Egypt near Mena House.  The top picture takes in part of the Australian troops, who are encamped on a sandy plane three quarters of a mile</p>
