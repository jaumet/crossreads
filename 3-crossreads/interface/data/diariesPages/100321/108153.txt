22/1/19 Gourdinne
Fine and sunny but roads frozen. Car called for me at 9 and Nallines was the next stage where picked up BM. Now rattled rapidly into Charleroi passed Marcinelle and came through a squalid quarter to Marchienne. There are plenty of mines and big factories. In the place at Marchienne I met Colonel Ross General Wisdom others and then judged the platoon competition. The 28th. won with a fine turnout. After a march past adjourned to a fine Chateau 7th. BdeHQ. had a drink with the General. Met the Baroness who speaks fluent English. Motored home in good time for lunch and spent the afternoon doing nothing. Our village is very quiet and things want rousing up to keep people from dopiness. Mess at 6 is always a reunion of all the officers and an event looked forward to.
