The reason for this is that my pay book being full, was taken from me & sent to England to be audited before a new one could be issued, &, as the rotten law is, no soldier can be paid without his book. Consequently being out of the line, & the change of buying some decent food I have been borrowing. But I hope the allotment will cover things alright. I don't know how much the insurance & other things amount to, but by the end of a years allotment I think things should be square, if not before. Of course I am living on 2/- per diem now, in fact we are only paid 40 francs (1/8/8) per fortnight, which doesn't go far towards some decent meals in the expensive land.
