The Present Cathedral was started in the year 1400 I think. I have to climb this Hill on the Bike. It is a nice Hill like Dee Why Hill. The River runs on the far side of the Trees which shew in the Centre of the Picture. It is 2 miles from the New Sarum or Salisbury, the modern name. How did you get on with the Pony. Did you ride. I guess You'll feel sore. I once sat in the saddle [indecipherable] in DonK in Egypt for 5 hours & could not sit down for 3 days.  Well, George, Regards to all & best of Luck  Love Harry
