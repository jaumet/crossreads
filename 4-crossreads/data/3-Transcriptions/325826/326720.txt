<p>4.  will be a sudden end to times together &amp; will be hard to get used to &amp; one does not know when it is all to end: there is a lot of talk here about our troops being moved to France soon &amp; if that is so of course he will go with them.  Still it is no use trying to look into the future.<br/>22.2.16  Must close this darling People.  No more news yet about Rid moving off to Tel-el-Keber, we are still hanging on from day to day, it seems too good to be true this lovely little time together, and this afternoon we have had Wal with us &amp; have had a great time.  He is still here with us for another hour or so; this afternoon we have been tramping round amongst the native streets, in the bazaars &amp; such like places &amp; it is all most intensely interesting though the squalor &amp; muddle of their life disgusts me fearfully; then we had an immense afternoon tea together at a stylish cafe- six cakes each only I got stuck at the fifth &amp; had to palm it off on to Wal the remaining one I mean.  I should have told you we had ices together first before starting out on our hour, we get reckless when we all get together &amp; start doing things in style.<br/>So very much love to you, you dear patient-waiting-at-home People&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your loving daughter<br/>Olive.</p>
