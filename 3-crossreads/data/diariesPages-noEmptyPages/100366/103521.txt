We are having a particularly rough time of it now. Reveille being at 3 am and never getting to bed before 10 pm. We all got flooded out today on account of an exceptionally heavy downpour of rain but it is a case of grin and bear it.

There are persistent rumours that Thiepval has fallen to us, but none of us believe it as yet, because on account of it being the key position of the Somme offensive we are all expecting a hard struggle for it, However everybody is anxious regarding the place and it will be a big relief to everyone when the position is won.

I closely observed some freshly arrived prisoners today in Senlis and really I cannot say much for there looks and physique and firmly believe that if they were not backed by such a huge quantity of artillery, that our fellows would walk through and through them.
