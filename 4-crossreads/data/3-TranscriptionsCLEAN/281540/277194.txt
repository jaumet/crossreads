  
 In my little home in a Trench (Tune Little grey home in the West) 
 I I've a little wet home in a trench Which the rainstorms continually drench There are dead Turks all round All polluting the ground Oh they give us a beautiful stench Underneath in the place of a floor There's a mass of wet mud & some gore And the "Jess Willards" bear Through the rain sodden air O'er my little wet home in the trench 
 II There are snipers who keep on the go So you must keep your old napper down low And their star shells at night Make a deuce of a light Which causes the language to flow Then biscuits & bully we chew For its weeks since we tasted a stew But with shells bursting there There's no place can compare With my little wet home in the trench
