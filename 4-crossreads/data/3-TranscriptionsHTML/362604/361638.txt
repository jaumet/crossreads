<p>Dear Dad, Mum, &amp; George,</p>
<p>I have no news to give you this week but as it is Sunday I'll write a few lines to let you know that we are still going strong.</p>
<p>It has been an awful windy day to-day.  The worst we have had this year.  I lit my fire after dinner &amp; have hardly left my room since.  I had the X'mas number of the Sunday Times sent to me by one of my Bexley Pals &amp; I had the Herald from Dad.  It was nice earlier in the week &amp; I spent Wednesday afternoon</p>
