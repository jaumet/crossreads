  
 Am writing this with my left hand and have to stop every now and then for a spell when you got the news that I was seriously ill I was down with Tetanus & was looked on as a nine days wonder afterwards for getting better.   I had a few words with the Doctor afterwards for sending out word that I was so bad, as I knew it was only a temporary indisposition, he laughed at me & said I cheated the undertaker & he wished all his patients were as tough.   I expect to catch a boat sometime in January & will probably have to land in W.A. first & get permission to go on to a Sydney Hospital as I will have to have Massage treatment for some time after getting home.   You might write to Drew McP. & thank him for writing & tell him I will answer when I see him also the kiddies.   I was tickled to death to get their letters last time I heard from Malcolm he was still going strong.   hope he is going to get them O.K. altho some of the boys don't mind getting a bit of a whack that will give them a trip to blighty for a month or two
