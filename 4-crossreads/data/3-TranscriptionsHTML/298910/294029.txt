<p>14/7/16  Friday</p>
<p>Raining off &amp; on &ndash; very cold. In charge of the Hospital pantry, can get this job permanently &amp; probably 2 stripes &ndash; no good to me as I am prepared to go to the trenches &amp; stay there as long as boys stay there. Went for a walk around Laventie &ndash; it is a fine Town, but now mostly ruins &ndash; got postcards of the Cathedral &amp; got a little piece of stained glass as a Souvenir.</p>
<p>Bombardment not so heavy today &ndash; About 12 wounded came in today. In our tobacco issue today I got a p' c enclosed from Miss E. A. Healy &ndash; c/o Telephone Exchange, Brisbane, also Miss W Fihilly  same address. I was quite pleased &amp; hope it is the Eileen Healy, that has given us many a good musical evening. I am returning both p'c's.</p>

<p>Raining &amp; dull &ndash; Very busy at the Clearing Station &ndash; hardly time to have meals. It is just like murder to see our fine lads coming in so helpless, &amp; knocked about &ndash; covered with mud &amp; blood, - for a while it used to upset</p>
