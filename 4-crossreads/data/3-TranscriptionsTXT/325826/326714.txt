 4.   2nd January 1916.   My dear Home Folk let me tell you what my first Sunday in these funny old lands has been like.  First of all I had "le petit dejeuner" at about 7 o'clock, which consisted of lots of bread &amp; a large pat of butter, and tea nicely served.  By the way I have been struck constantly by the nice china that is used for every purpose over here.
