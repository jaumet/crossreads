<p>Easter Day 8 April 1917</p>
<p>Re sheep when I have time I'll write Minister of Agriculture re possibility of RAM Trade here with Australia. They are mongrel sheep but the country is good. I can see Turksshells bursting over our planes as I write.</p>
<p>Marching here we passed over the Rafa Battlefield &amp; saw the graves of the men we lost there Jan. 9th. The Bedouins were gathering their Barley over the Battlefield, shells everywhere.</p>
<p>KHAN YUNUS is covered with prickly pears &amp; scrubby Bushes, Old Ruins on every side, not too good to fight in, we got Hotchkiss guns issued today.</p>
