St & saw Mr Dick Holsom. He told me Claire Holsom only went back from leave on Monday & that Billy Holsom was passed. He would have taken me out to his place only he has just had an addition to the family. After leaving PB & Cos went back to Tottenham Ct Rd. by Bus, had tea at a restaurant & went per tube via the bank to Clapham Common to see Uncle Charlie. He was out when I arrived at his place so after waiting about 1/2 hr I left again, after leaving some souvenirs for him to mind. I arrived back about 1/2 past 9 feeling very tired. On way from Dover by train had a fine view
