<p>Jan 6th 1918<br />The rain which has been theatening much of late came down in heavey downpour during the night &amp; has continued without cessation all day. Heavy winds also accompany it so we just had to stay in our bivouac &amp; tell yarns the yarns by&nbsp;the way were mostly told by Capt Hurley conserning his trip to the South P. &amp; it was very interesting to listen to him. The big flat where we had the unpleasant experience of being&nbsp;<s>washed</s>&nbsp;flooded out on Xmas day is again awash &amp; the roads impassable. The wadies have been running bankers &amp; Tport is more or less disorganised, Thank heaven it is dry in our tent for I&nbsp;look across a dismal expance of mud where the Horse Tport &amp; Camels are having a miserable time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
