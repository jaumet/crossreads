 to leave the "Schutzen Haus" within a few days to go to Alddamm Laager prior to departure for Switzerland. The glorious news overwhelmed me and not until the Huns departed shouting "Schweiss" did I believe the news to be true. I lost my pangs of hunger and fell to hopping about excitedly.  I lost my pangs of hunger and    I neither ate nor slept that day or night. 
 26th to 28th. On the morning of the 26th. the Hun Doctor confirmed the glorious news and told me to hold myself in readiness to leave on the 28th. I was the happiest and most excited man on earth, during the 27th and 28th I did not require food or sleep despite my previous intense hunger. The only regret I had, was leaving my unfortunate comrades to suffer the Hunland hell. 
 29th. 10 a.m. Several Huns escorted me to the Laager. I found my old bunk still vacant and the familiar faces smiling but haggard and thinner. Sergt. Johnson and Cpl:  Wilks visited me from the original British barrack and extended congratulations. I hate leaving such men as these behind. Sergt. Johnson is eligible for exchange on account of serious wounds in the stomach and Wilks is lame and ill. Nevertheless, they are pleased to see others leave the country. These two men have comforted me and extended kindness and assistance during the most difficult trials of my captivity, despite their own wounds and misery. The men in Altdamm owe much to the untiring energy of these two staunch Britons. 
 30th. The whole morning was spent in preparing for departure. Huns raved and stormed  in preparing for  out particulars. In the afternoon the men fit and exempt from work provided a few hours diversion by playing football. Parcels have resumed the ordinary routine. I received two badly damaged grocery packets and managed to recover sufficient for several good meals. The party for exchange consists of four disabled men and two men returned from Commandos. Between twenty and thirty disabled men are still awaiting exchange. Many of the latter are old prisoners and are more entitled to exchange than myself. There are also many men in the English Company unfit for work, but the Huns will not release them. These men have repeatedly asked the Hun doctor to arrange for repatriation. He offers no assistance, whatsoever.
