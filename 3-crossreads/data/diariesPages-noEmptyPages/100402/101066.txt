Thursday 2 May
The Boche has been fairly quiet again to-day but what few he has sent over have landed close to our billett, "duds" everyone. Very warm. Playing cricket all day.
Hankin wounded up the line this morning.
Friday 3 May
Still on the Northern outskirts of Hazebrouck, doing little else but play cricket all day.
Beautiful weather. A walk to Hondenghem this evening.
