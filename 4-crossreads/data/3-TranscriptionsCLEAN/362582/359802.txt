usually one has a little Arab boy (donkey-boy) running behind & he has a peculiar call to make it go. I had a nice letter from Mrs Capp & so glad she liked the photo. Also poor old Alice writes to me very often. I hope to see George this week. Fred said he is a grand fellow & says he will get on. I do not know where poor old Norman is but must try & send some more cigarettes to him. I think he is out on the Desert not very far from here. Hope Charlie gets his Commission before he comes out again. I had a nice letter from Ella & Doll from Tasmania. I shall try & write them a few lines this week. Dr Cordner was operated upon for appendicitis at No. 1 A.G.H. the day before we left The palace, & I have not heard how he got on since. So glad to hear Flo is so well, I'm awfully sorry I missed seeing Archie. May meet him in France. Talk about Fleas!! You should see our fleas -
