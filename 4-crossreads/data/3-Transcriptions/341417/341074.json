<p>Dear Mr. Ifould</p>
<p>You already have a Rowley letter or two in the Mitchell. Here is another. I enclose a copy of some verses by the King who was shot at Rowley's side. King's brother (George) is on our staff and is at the front.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br/>George Robertson</p>
<p>[Signaller George Edward King, No 507, 19th Battalion, killed in action 4 December 1916 in France. George King's letters are in the State Library's collection, in A 2660 Volume 1, letters written on active service, A-L, 1914-1919.]</p>
