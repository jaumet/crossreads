 
pretty. They all hail the Australians with delight, having become tired of the Canadians & Imperials on account of them having been here for so long & also I suppose the Australian pay.

One grave danger of this place is the frequency of gas attacks, & every time the gas alarm sounds one has to get up & fall in on parade with gas helmets on, & place nosebags full of wet hay lightly over the horses heads.

All the villagers are engaged on hops picking of which there is a very large amount grown, & all ages are to be seen in the hops fields picking away for their lives.

We are in rear of Hill 60 made famous about 12 months ago by the furious fighting & to all accounts, it will soon be the scene of further strafing. They say it is all under mined & expected to be blown up at any time. Things in the fighting line are dead tame here in comparison to the Somme & the comparative quietness is a blessing as 6 weeks in Albert was sufficient for Richard but I understand we are to go again later on.
