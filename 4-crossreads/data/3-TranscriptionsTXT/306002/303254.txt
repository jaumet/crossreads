22.8.15Sun. 22nd.  I believe casualties were very heavy again on the left on account of the attacking.  General Russell who is commanding the attacking forces sent word that his right was held up with machine guns.  This morning our aeroplane was busy &amp; sent back a wireless message saying Turks were bringing up a large number of reinforcements, heavy fighting still continues &amp; the 17 &amp; 18th are in the thick of it &amp; I believe have suffered rather heavy.  Neither Penny, Smithers or myself have been feeling too frisky to-day stomach troubles.  I believe Tapp has to leave here on account of being blind in one eye, he does not like going &amp; he has been bad with dysentery the last week or two.
