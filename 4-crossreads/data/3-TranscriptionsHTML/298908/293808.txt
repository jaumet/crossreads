<p>has just died with it, how stiff is he.  They reckon we are likely to stop here for a while until it dies down for they are frightened we might bring it aboard &amp; give it to the rest of the patients, everyone is getting fed up &amp;amp some are taking their 10 weeks in Blighty through so much messing about.<br/>We had to find 80 men today for various duties &amp;amp a nice time we have had getting them off.<br/>After tea this evening I went into Town mainly with the idea of having a hot bath but on arrival found that there were no baths open of a Sunday night so I did the next best thing under the circumstances had a good feed then a stroll round the street &amp; home.  I much prefer walking than riding these nights it helps to settle ones feelings &amp; makes me more contented which under the present conditions is not up to much.  I hate hanging about &amp;amp there are so many temptations to dodge.</p>
