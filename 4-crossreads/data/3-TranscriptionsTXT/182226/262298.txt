 Sunday 3 October, 1915 
 Have been given clearance certificate which will take me off the Peninsula. I am sorry in a way because I don&#39;t like leaving my pals but I am too jolly weak to do anything. 
 Mac &amp; Bernie helped me down to the beach hospital. 
 Mail came in today. Had a letter from Beryl &amp; Hilda. I am very disappointed at not getting one from the Mater. 
 As soon as I got to the beach hospital Beachy sent a shrapnel along which splatted all over the cases that we were behind &amp; hit one man in the arm, just a few yards away &amp; later killed a man in swimming. 
 Went aboard S.S. Hospital Ship Assaye. 
 Had a bit of stiff luck, lost my watch, may be lucky enough to get it back. 
 Met Bunny Abbot &amp; Arthur Taylor.
