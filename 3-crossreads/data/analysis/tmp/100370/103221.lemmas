 of the hill . Right on the furthest edg of this the Ambulanc was camp . It is good to be so near abund of water . After unyok and fix the hors up , a shave and a bath are pleasant duti . The old villag of Beitunia crown the hill on the left of the road . here March 8th We are to stay in this Camp , I hear , until afternoon . Last night I was awak by the gentl patter of the rain on the roof of my bivvi , and this morn it is come down steadili . We can look forward to two or three day of wet and discomfort again I suppos . As we are now well into March , the raini season should be about over . I hope so , at ani rate . Three of us went up into the villag on the hill this morn . The place are of veri solid construct , one in particular is veri larg and underneath are stone arch open into all kind of queer tortuous passag and underground room . In these the nativ popul live in the midst of filth and odour indescrib . In the centr of the villag among the ruin are two marbl column , one upright , the other lie down . They are about 13 ft . long , with cornic top and bottom , they have no inscript of ani kind , but have without doubt been brought from some more pretenti build than ani in the villag . A Turkish batteri has been camp here at one time , but the ground all round his gun posit is pit with shell-hol , or H.E. leav a tremend caviti about 10 yds . from him . An old Arab tell us about it , said that , after that shell came mani of the Turk " slept" . I should think they did . ? The rest ? he said "imshi " ( ran away ) . From the top of the hous a good view of Jerusalem can be seen , and on the left crown a hill the Christian villag of Rammalah Ram Allah . The promis of rain in the morn did not , fortun for us , materialis , and the afternoon is fine . Accord to Brigad Order , we were to move out at 4.30 P.M. With characterist militari precis we move at 5 P.M. and went about 500 yard , where we stuck till about 6.30 . It was alreadi dark when we pass through the villag of Ram Allah . Even in the gloom one could distinguish mani fine build in this place , most , by their appear , of a religi charact .
