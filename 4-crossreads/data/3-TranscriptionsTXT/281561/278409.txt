8/7/17.Went to see the unvieling of the Pozieres Memorial. There was a good deal of rain all day. The memorial is a simple affair; a small granite column with an inscription plate, erected not far from where the village once stood. It is hard to recognise the position again, for grass has overgrown everything where I thought grass could never grow again.11/7/17.There was some ceremonial drill today, they must be expecting some Head along. Yesterday, there was a demonstration with a German "Flammenwerper", ("Flame Throwers") As I have already seen these engines in actual battle it was no novelty. This dreadful weapon throws a "jet" of withering flame about 90 feet; but it is easily dealt with.
