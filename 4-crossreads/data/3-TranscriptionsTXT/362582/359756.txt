me, took me in a Motor to Shepheard's to Dinner & then a Garry drive back to Heliopolis. I wore my pink evening dress. We had a very happy time, he is quite delighted to have a Sister to take out & is being very attentive. We have 3 of his men in our hospital & he is awfully good to them & they are all very fond of him. I miss poor old Charlie very much, hope he has a pleasant trip - have heard since he left that the boat was a miserable ship. His mother & father will be delighted to see him & thought he looked splendid when he left. He will tell you all about me & no doubt you will find him most interesting. It is grand to think of the dear kid being such a brave soldier. I was awfully proud to be a friend of his, but really all of them are wonderfully brave & bright. Oh, how I should just love to have a peep at you all when the dear boy goes to see you. Poor Sister Murray
