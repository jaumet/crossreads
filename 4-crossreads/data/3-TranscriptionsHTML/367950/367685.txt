<p>smelling stuff but extremely good to drink very strange but true and is often the case in these desert wells. The major part of the water procurable has no smell but is brackish and not fit for human consumption. This place where we are to stay for a few days is only a small clump of date palm trees and the water is particularly good our own water by the way is sent up from Kantara by rail and transported by camel from the nearest railway station across the desert. The receptacles are flat tank like vessels made of strong galvanized iron and very strongly made &amp; called "fantassie's" I don't know if that is Arabic or not. All fires out by 5.30 and no lights after that hour. So runs the manifesto issued from the brain of the great Staff at Brigade Headquarters. Last night our lights were out and fires deadened. A corresponding order in the Navy is "Darken ship" so we darken ship accordingly and the strange part of the thing is that the lights, fires, candles lamps etc are blazing merrily and any scouts of the enemy anywhere within miles can see them and if he ("Jacko") had any artillery handy he would plant a shell right into the middle of the lights. Of course Brigade imagine that no one can see their lights. But the regiments must put out all lights after dark "Oh! How we do muddle through!"</p>
