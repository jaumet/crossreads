<p>for the afternoon I am making one of a party which are going out driving round the Island<br/>I am no less than 9 days behind so I am just going to scribble on from memory &amp; without dates that's the worst of leave one has never time to keep his diary up for he is going all the time.<br/>well I suppose I must start where I left off the drive I think it was, we were driven round some of the beauty spots of the Isle &amp; no doubt they were lovely real old country lanes &amp; every thing smothered with flowers, I have never seen such a variety before in my life, we were out 8 hours during which time we visited Castletown an ancient &amp; quaint old place with a very old prison</p>
