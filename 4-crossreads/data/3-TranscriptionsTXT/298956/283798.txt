 Nothing exciting happened until about 10 p.m. on the 5th September.  We were steaming along easily when bang went the ships sides.  We waited expecting to hear shots fired but nothing further happened.  That same night the "Wolf" laid her last mines off Singapore, 111 in all.  When the last mine went over the Germans gave three cheers.

Through the opening in the two we could see to the top of the main mast. 
 The "Wolf" was steaming full speed, and at 3 p.m. we heard the ships sides drop with a bang and watched the German Ensign hoisted to the mast
