<p>Sept 1916<br/>8th/13 - For a snack for breakfast, likewise Oghratina for dinner arriving at Hod-el-Fatia about 4.30pm. 5th L.H. camped in that hod also. 6th &amp; 7th L.H. being further on. Pitched about half a doz. bell tents for hospitals, all others building Gunyahs of date palm leaves. Dates here very large, &amp; ripening. Beginning to understand how Turks live on three dates, dry bread &amp; water. Couple of men experiencing discomforts of eating too many. Taube passed by on A.M. of 12th Did not even look at us. Water in hod good as regards usual well water. About 41 camels attached to us, our blankets etc arriving on evening of 13th 5th L.H. again joining up with brigade, having been apart since <indecipherable> sometime in April. Camel corps recently captured 25 camel loads of Big gun ammunition &amp; reports current of large qties of rice grain<br/>8th/13th &ndash; etc being found in caves in hills about ten miles out on Serapeum road. Capt Woods ex A.M.D. sig Sqd being reported to our unit.<br/>13th/25th &ndash; On 15th about 6pm. our unit moved over to BHQ staying there till m'dn't when with the regts we moved out arriving at Hod-el-Geila about 5.30 am or 6am. Quite a number of our 'planes over us &amp; a Taube was sighted. M.G. shots heard. Could see nothing of duel but on returning to camp learnt that one of ours was down this side of Bir-el-Abd, bullet-holed etc otherwise seemed O.K. About 4.45pm we left Geila travelling all night &amp; about 4.30am halted a mile or so, possibly more this side of Hod-el-Mazar where Turks were entrenched &amp; well dug-in. Opinions differ as to whether surprise was effected or not. My own opinion was "Yes"</p>
