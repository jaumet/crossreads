It was afterwards observed that these warships were engaged convoying the ten New Zealand troopships across to Albany and it was a very picturesque sight to watch - As they approached the entrance they formed up into single line and slowly they began to enter at 10-30 A.M. headed by the "Minoraur".The warships proceeded to replenish their bunkers, whilst the troopships took up their anchorage in their allotted line.
Japanese cruiser "Iluki" left again at 2 P.M. en route for Freemantle so as to join troopships conveying West Australian troops overseas, and afterwards convoy them out and join our fleet at a rendezvous - We proceeded up harbour again at 2.15 PM to enable us to take in stores and provisions after which we took up our former duties
