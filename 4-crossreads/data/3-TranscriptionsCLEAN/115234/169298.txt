 my pals are all in the little dugout sleeping the sleep of tired & weary soldiers  Fritz is putting Mennin werfers & pigeon bombs all round us but luckily so far he has not located us.  There is a damned sniper skimming the parapet every few minutes.  He is a nuisnace & I'm going to have a go at him in a few minutes
