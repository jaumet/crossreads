<p>[13-14 September]</p>
<p>a number of natives evidently islanders for use as reinforcements to the local people. She was brought in by a destroyer. She is a very queer looking craft, resembling rather a river steamer.</p>
<p>It was told us today evidently on good authority that the island Tenute (?) island, in the Channel, had a stock of coal 3000 or 4000 tons and many warlike stores etc, in sheds. We had a suspicion that coal was here somewhere.</p>
<p>An order came on Friday afternoon for me to conduct the funeral of Capt Pockley and Williams A.B. The bodies were landed about 4pm at Herbertshohe and rested in the P.O. until the ground was prepared. They were then taken in procession composed of naval and military forces, about 50 in all, about &frac34; of a mile to the cemetery where I read the service. Lieut Holmes, (son of Brig. Gen Col. Holmes) repres. the Brigadier and several other officers attended.</p>
<p>Word came through that the "Geier", a small German cruiser was at sea near the channel today. The Melbourne and a destroyer were forthwith sent to search. So far we have not heard if she was found. It is stated that the "Scharnhorst" was here on 28th July to 3rd Aug and left on outbreak of war and has not been here since. One of the [indecipherable] cruisers "Planet" was here</p>
