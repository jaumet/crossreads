  
 23rd.   A Taube was up bright & early this morning & our gunners were getting good practice at her they are such rarities nowadays that when one is spotted they are an object of interest, I don't know what became of her. 
 Capt. McKenzie came back last night & is going to take over C. Coy in the morning I think the boys will be rather pleased at this for Mac. is a sport. 
 After parade this morning they had a couple of ties "pulled" in the tug of war C. Coy defeated D. & the Transport & now have to pull A. to win. 
 Had a roast for dinner today the first one for a long time.
