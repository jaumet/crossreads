I heard today that Sergt Sutherland (Bde H.Q.) has also applied for Sig Officer to this Regt. & as Col Meredith left yesterday & is on his way to Australia on leave I am not too confident of getting it although Major Granville is doing all he can to get me the Commission We are pretty busy here as we have lamp practice every night. 5 Enemy planes bombed Port Said yesterday & I believe a couple of them were brought down
