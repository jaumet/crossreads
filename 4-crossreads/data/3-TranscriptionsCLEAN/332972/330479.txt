When in the big Cell, the former Provost Marshall Bardsly in company of several Police entered, picked him out  &  ordered this Intenee to be remoived into a isolation cell,  &  teached bad language.

They dealt it out to him untill he wher senseless, they left him laying on the bar ground  &  locked the door  &  went away. The next morning he wher returned into the big cell, shewing marks all over his body. This information I have of the illtreated Internee himself also 5 Internees who wher in other Cells at the time.

When I explained to him that as the nights wher very cold this blankets being allmost tread bare  &  full of holes on account of 4 years constant use, they wher insufficient to keep me warm. The Soldier pitied me  &  advised me, to pinch one of my fellow Internees
