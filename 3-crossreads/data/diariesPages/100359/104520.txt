Monday 6th Trip To Cairo.
The orderly Officer. Dashed down to the station, purchased, our tickets, 13 P.T. return and boarded the train for Cairo, The train left about 7.20 and after a very pleasant trip in the train. We arrived in Cairo at 9.30 a.m. on both sides of the Railway the land is under cultivation as far as the eye can see. The sweet water canal, which is a branch of the Nile, runs right along and the water is distributed by a good canal system over the farms. At intervals there are small villages which consist of a heap of squalid looking huts many grubby looking children, a few dogs, camels and donkeys and fowls and ducks in galore. Each farm has its old fashioned water wheel which is usually pulled round by an ox or donkey. The women seem to work just as hard as the men carrying bundles of produce, milking cows and driving large herds of goats about to pasture. We saw an Arab, with an assorted team, ploughing, (a camel and a donkey) and they worked together well. We arrived in Cairo feeling jolly hungry, so we went to the nearest restaurant and had breakfast, which consisted of 4 eggs each, and bread and butter and coffee. "Billsy" May would have liked some jam, but was not "game" to ask for it. As soon as we had eaten we took the tram for the Pyramids. It took about 40 mins to get there and the fare was 1 p.t. It is very interesting ride, and we crossed the Nile. I think 3 times. The Bridges are fine piece of work, but I forget their names excepting that of the Kaiser-el-Nil, which is the largest. On the way out we passed a big crowd of English Tommies marching along and they looked very well and in the pink of condition. We unloaded from the tram, together with an Arab Guide, who we engaged to show us round.
