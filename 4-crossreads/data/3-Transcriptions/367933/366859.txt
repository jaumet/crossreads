<p>Palestine  December 28th 1917</p>
<p>Dear Friends<br/>I wish to send a few lines on behalf of our boys here at the front to show our appreciation to our friends at home who have worked so hard to make our Christmas over here a little brighter. This is the fourth Christmas I have spent at the front and I can say the happiest although it was very wet and cold weather. So I think all we boys here owe a great deal to our people at home for their kindness to us.<br/>I will close this card now by wishing you all the best of luck for the coming season again thanking your all</p>
<p>I remain your sincere  friend at the front<br/>Cpl. J R Quarmby<br/>1st L.H.Regt.<br/>Egypt.</p>
