We arrived at this enormous building about 8 pm, numbers of native servants rushed out and grabbed our suitcases &ndash; and we went into a large hall, up two flights of stairs till we came to a large vestibule and the home sister, a queer dried up little woman, ushered us into rooms. Six &amp; four sisters in each. Large bare rooms which had been suites of rooms when the place was a hotel &ndash; a bathroom off each. The floors bare cement and the weather very cold &ndash; we had expected to have hot weather here. We then had to go to the linen room and receive 2 sheets 2 blankets &amp; a pillowslip &amp; towel from the home sister. We made our beds up and had dinner. The Mess here, is catered for by a french woman she provides, china silver linen &amp; servants for 22/- a week. We are having her in our new home. This does away with our mess committee etc &ndash; that we had at Lemnos. It may be more expensive - but I do not know yet. I will write about that later.
