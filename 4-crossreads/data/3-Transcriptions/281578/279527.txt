<p>churns them up at intervals. Had a sleep till 12,when tucker again came up. The Brigadier of our 4th Brigade (Brand) &amp; 4th Division commander (Major Gen. Mc Lagan) passed our dugout, &amp; the latter said "Good morning boys" as he passed. (Got my pen filled when I went back to the transport lines, as I'll now relate). I was told by the A.S.M. that I had to report to B.O.R. at 4 p.m., so I shaved, packed my gear &amp; set off; was told I had to go down to the transport lines to give evidence in a court martial. I was surprised, as I knew nothing about any court martial case. Didn't know where the transport lines are either, but an officer said they were on the other side of Daours, so I started on a long trudge of  7 miles. Got about a mile along the Somme Canal when a 13th Bn. limber, which had been up with the rations, came along, &amp; I worded the driver &amp; hopped in. Luckily he was going right back, so besides saving me the walk, I didn't have to hunt round for the place. The field cookers were a few miles back, so I had tea there, as I had left our pozzy before the stew arrived. On reporting at the orderly room back at the transport lines, they didn't know what I had been sent down for, &amp; I'm blowed if it wasn't Corporal Geikie who was wanted , &amp; not I. Our names aren't much alike either, still it's the army.</p>
