<p>11 Monday<br/>Yesterday the Colonel held a general parade &amp; complemented us on our work on the Somme Front, he also presented a sergeant with the military cross &amp; mentioned 2 others being mentioned in despatches.  Today was a very fine day, although a shower of rain in the afternoon.  On duty all day repairing, weeding &amp; cleaning drains.  Saw Bill Freeman &amp; went round the town with him.  The people are very obliging here.</p>
<p>12 Tuesday<br/>Rather a cloudy day, rained a couple of times during the day.  Didn't have anything to do all day.  We can hear the firing of the big guns quite plain here.  We are billeted in small huts (thatched roofs).  Apparently the Canadians were here along time, as they had beds in all the huts, I was fortunate enough to get one, there are about 22 of us in the one hut; they are very comfortable.  Saw Billy Collyer around the town in the afternoon he is in the 4th D.A.C.</p>
<p>13 Wednesday<br/>We get up about 8 am, have breakfast 8 am dinner 12.30 pm &amp; tea 5 pm, we very seldom have any parades.  Detailed with a squad putting up a hospital tent, it didn't take us very long to put it up.  Sewed 4th division colours on my tunic.  We are not getting very good food here, I believe we got better in the line.  There are a good few hotels in Reninghelst.  The Belgian people seem to drink a terrible lot of beer.  The 4th division's colours are chockolate circles, we don't wear brigade colour.</p>
