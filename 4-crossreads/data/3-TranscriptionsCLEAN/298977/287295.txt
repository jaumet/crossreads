 26th June 1916  Two observation balloons destRoyed by our planes this afternoon and four more forced to descend.  To-night was extremely lively.  Fritz got in on us and gave us a lively time for about an hour.  Starting at 9 o'clock and kept it up every half hour for about three hours.  However, we replied vigorously and quietened him.  Later on we gave him his own back with interest and incidentally carried out a successful raid and repulsed one by Fritz leaving.
