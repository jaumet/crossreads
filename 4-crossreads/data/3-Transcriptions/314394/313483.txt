<p>Y4A  Bty. Covered HOLLANDSCHESCHUUR SALLIANT,BOIS QUARRANTE,SUNKEN ROAD SALIANT  and  CROONAERT CHAPELLE. Front line, supports and communications were systematically strafed. Much material observed to be displaced, duck boards, wire and ravetting. Much trouble encounter with rifle mechanisms. Cpl. BLAKE particularly commended for firing greatest number of rounds in spite of having to remove rifle mechanism at least six times. Mechanism eventually burst also clamping band. Retaliation consisted of a feeble volley of rum-jars and a few rifle grenades.<br/>Ammunition expended as follows:-<br/>No 1 70 rounds<br/>No 2 66 rounds<br/>No 3 56 rounds<br/> No 4 58 rounds<br/>Z4A Bty.No 1 and 2 guns on PICADILLY FARM, Front line and supports.<br/>One round from No 2 gun fell just out of the mortar and fortunately failed to explode. This was put down to faulty cordites. No 3 gun fired on F.L.T., supports and wire. Trouble experienced with four joints of extension frame and the gun overheating. Enemy mortar retaliation damaged parapet of No 1 gun. Several 5.9s fell in the rear of the pits doing no damage.<br/>Ammunition expended as follows:-<br/> No 1 gun 31 rounds<br/>No 2 gun 60 rounds<br/>No 3 gun 56 rounds<br/>No 4 gun 70 rounds<br/>V4A Bty. Very careful preparations had been made for the registration of the heavy gun on RUINED FARM. The mortar was trained on the Farm at a range of 1000 yards, 200 yards more than the actual range, to obviate the possibility of a short round falling in our own trenches. The barrel was cleaned, sponged and warmed. The first round was observed by Captn.Sherwood to fall about 15 yards from the pit, and did not explode. The second round travelled about 450 yds. And was likewise a dud. Fourth round just reached German front line (600) yds. and detonation was observed to be perfect. Fifth round was a repetition of the fourth. Sixth and seventh rounds dropped 600 and 300 yards short of the point aimed at. As all these rounds were fired at the same range and elevation, Captn.Sherwood considered it unwise to expend further ammunition and therefore ceased firing at 3.30 p.m.   The erratic shooting was considered due to defective charges. It afforded great satisfaction to those who had spent so much time and labour on construction of the pit, to know that the bed proved in every way satisfactory.</p>
