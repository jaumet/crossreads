 the back of camel and taken to a place outsid the villag into small heap . There it is be thresh in a veri antiqu manner . A vehicl , someth like a larg armchair with a flat bottom , is use . The Yellaheen seat himself on this and is drawn round in a circl by bullock . It struck one as veri funni to see a man seat on one of these vehicl with a huge umbrella held over his head . This was not to keep off the rain but to shield himself from the intens heat of the sun . A descript of what is to be seen in the field just now near our camp should be veri interest , at least it is veri pretti and would requir the work of a good artist to do justic to it in a pictur . A small part of the field where the grain is ripe for harvest there are a dozen nativ , men and women and children . Some are cut the grain , other are load it on to the back of camel , whilst some of the older nativ are sit in the crouch up fashion peculiar to them , deep in convers , and the children are run about play with one anoth as children of other countri do . On the part where the corn has been cut , cattl , donkey and goat are graze . This with the sand of the desert in front and the green set behind form a veri pretti pictur . May 24th Mon 25th Tue . Larg number of bird of the swallow type are fli about here . Sent P.C.A. away .
