Those who will defend Australia only on Australian shores must understand that the conditions of modern war make such a position ridiculous.  Britain has not been invaded, but she has none the lest to fight for her existence on foreign soil as Australia is fighting for  ours  hers.  To defend a coast of 9000 miles with our small population simply by a few ships (not even up to date ships) & by a Home Defence Force is entirely impossible.  We can only  secure  preserve Australia's security by strengthening the hands of Britain in the peace negotiations & in the bargainings which will come after.
