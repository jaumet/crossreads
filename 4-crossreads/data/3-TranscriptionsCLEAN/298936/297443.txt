Wood fatigue in camp [indecipherable] away ill.
Received letter & birthday card from Rita letter from Woodlawn.
Hear we are going to England - just the usual rumour I suspect.
Wrote long letter to Rita.
Feel in very good health.
Had a good look around trenches yesterday & saw Gun ridge which they say would finish the business if taken.  Seems an improbable task.
The line at Popes Hill on left is very near the Narrows & surely we cannot keep getting across in time.
