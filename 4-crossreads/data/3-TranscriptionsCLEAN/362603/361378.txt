3.  Hours with   out   nothing but a plate of rice custard.  Now I eat all day like a fowl.  Hilda Hickson sent me a parcel   &   there was chocolate, Dates   &   a Tin of Biscuits.  I have nibbled it all away in two days.  She also sent one to Billy   &   I took it over with a letter from His Mother.  Billy has been claimed for other work in Lark Hill Camp.  He has left the Unit.  Bill Drummond who played Lacrosse with us, was in Park House, our old Camp, but lo   &   behold when Bill Alli arrived at Lark Hill, there was Bill Drummond camped in the very next Hut.  I get a letter each from Marie   &   Jennie every week   &   sometimes one from Auntie.  Uncle Tom has had some bad losses on the Farm lately.  First wild dogs got amongst the sheep   &   killed 7 outright.  As all were carrying young ones it is a severe loss   &   several others were much torn about   &   all the young ones will probably be born dead.  Now, Dad, Mum,   &   George, I am pretty tired so as I have to be up early to-morrow, I will buzz off to bed.  Thanks for the flowers.  They do remind us of Home.Give My Regards to all the Neighbours   &   with Best Love to You allI say adieuYour own BoyHarry XXX
