 Out again keeping Johnny Turk occupied- One bullet hit the sand about a yard from me this morning- it was as usual quite hot to handle.  Nearly got to England that time. Taubes spotting again    We are short of good big Battle Planes & men to fly them.  We lost a couple of Horses & one man wounded today, I dug a Mauser bullet out of the sand 2 yards from me- the Turks are using some of the old pattern Mausers, that make the double report- the bullet is the same.
