<p>engaged on Courts Martial (as President) it is interesting work but a very unpleasant business. I sat on 11 cases in 3 days and shall finish tomorrow about midday.</p>
<p>One interesting case (still sub judice) is of a man who is alleged to have stolen 34 marks from a Bosche officer prisoner, unfortunately one's personal inclinations cannot always be given effect to or possibly the accused might have gained promotion. Abey Cohen is alternately a member of the court and prosecutor, so long as he is something he appears to be quite happy. I had occasion to sit on him very hard on 2 separate cases today.</p>
<p>I am at present housed in a delightful little hut in a good camp and am very comfortable and fit.</p>
<p>Best love<br/>Affectionately yours<br/>C.R.Lucas</p>
<p>Ps. How you would like to see a copy of my report from the School. Unfortunately it would be censorable</p>
