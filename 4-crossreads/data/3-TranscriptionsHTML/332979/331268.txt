<p>nap. Sergeant Burden &amp; myself starts a Class for First Aid tomorrow amongst the Railway Boys we have about 40 names on our list so hope it will be a Success. We have a large number of Certificated Men amongst us so we will not be Short of instructors.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6/3/17.<br/>As I anticipated there were a fair number of Lads turned up for the First Aid &amp; having a fair number of Bandages &amp; Splints we had a very interesting two hours, as we are close on our next port the class will be postponed until we get to sea again.</p>
