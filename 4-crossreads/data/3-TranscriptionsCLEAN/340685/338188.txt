which supplies goods at (to us) ridiculously low prices. All goods are sold at manufacturers prices as there is no duty and there is every imaginable think going to be purchased.22.5.16 Training in the Bull ring of lectures and bayonet fighting and done by skilled instructors who have been to the front and have been made sergeant instructors. A French patrol airship passed over this morning and she is a regular ship observing for submarines in the channel.23.5.16 Two dress parade inspections and another go in the bull ring24.5.16 This time for the front. Of course, we failed. But the whole exam was in consequence of our N.C.O's saying we had had 9 months training. We made a mess of the whole show through the N.C.O's who know very very little of their work at all and are very unpopular.25.5.16 In the evening after our drill we went for a steam bath. It is near the station in the main camp about 3 miles from here and run by the A.M.C. 3 boilers supply steam and after we had handed in our clothes and given a check we went into a room filled with steam and stayed in about 3 or 4 minutes but I stayed in all the time about 12 minutes. It cleaned us well and we passed out had a warm shower and then a cold one and marched home clean. Sunday 22.5.16  Church parade at 9 and conducted by a Scotch man. Very good service.26.5.16 No aeroplanes to-day. Went to the bull-ring to-day at 8 and as soon as we got there the N.C.O's were called out separately for instruction and first we had the Mills hand grenade No 3 explained and then the Stayer rifle grenade No 5. Had practice in throwing live bombs but not rifle grenades as an accident occurred lately and they are too dangerous. Then machine gun instruction and practice I let off 2 sho9ts each time twice and got 3 bulls and an outer but very few got one shot off. One man as many as 7 before he could stop. Lewis machine gun fires 67 rounds in about 4 1/2 seconds. Got back and had dinner and rested until tea at 4.30 feeling pretty tired. No pay since the 29th of April and now I have had to borrow even tobacco. However I got 5 francs which may carry me through. We receive 29f for notes and 27f for gold coin normal peace values being 25f 20c. So we do well changing. Bought tobacco and went early to bed.27.5.16 Took our blankets out on parade this morning and the N.C.O's came back to gather any loose ones as we only have one blanket each and it is very cold at night but couldn't get any more. Rest of our mob went down to the shore for rifle exercises while I took out some men for fatigue and finished at about 10 spent rest of morning writing this up in the sun and it is fine out.
