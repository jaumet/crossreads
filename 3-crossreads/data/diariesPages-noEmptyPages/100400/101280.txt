Oct 27th. Still in Mametz Wood the weather though temporarily brightening still continues wet dull. A mail came in cheered things up. This afternoon I had a look at a German howitzer with its elaborate writings etc.
Oct 28th Still in Mametz Wood in bad weather wind rain. In fact the whole crowd is as miserable as the weather. I had a look at some of our guns to-day. 6", 9.2" etc they are formidable in looks numbers. Mail.
Oct 29th. As yesterday, no change in weather which is impeding operations
Oct 30th. Still in Mametz Wood in continuous rain. A couple had a look over the Tanks yesterday also a couple of Russian Guns dated 1882 captured from them by the Germans
Oct 31st. Move to-day to Longueval, passing High Wood, Delville Wood the two Bazentins. We are about three miles west of Combles near Trones Wood. As usual the day is sometimes dull at others sunny, the place is still a sea of mud. We are still a good way behind the line about four miles, the nearest point is somewhat beyond Flers. Our position is a good deal to the right of course more advanced than before.
Nov 1st. Move up to the 2nd Bgde Aid Post, about four miles. On the way we passed a few stranded tanks. On arriving we had to pull the dugout down re-erect it. The shelling is consistent but mostly on a wood village a few hundred yards behind us. One shell burst in our sunken road five yards from the group of us but nothing else resulted except in mud a shaking up. The country is very muddy I anticipate a rough time when we get a case- none of which have come in yet. The trenches are thigh high in mud the men are suffering terribly from trench feet. We have still undisturbed control of the air
Nov 2nd. Early this morning at 12.30 we had a case had to carry it through mud slush rain etc.
