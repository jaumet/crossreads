the scheme he has adopted should will work alright but I don't believe him. The Sergts. have not been catered for decently. Devonport is full of naval craft of all sorts. H.M.S Tiger is quite close to us and Admiral Beatty's flagship the H.MS Lion has is about 400 yards ahead along the wharf. On our right is the Ben Bow the biggest naval boat in the British Navy some say. She certainly is a tremendous size. The aeroplane ship H.M.S.  [no name written ] is near by also. She is a peculiar looking craft.  No funnels or rigging are to be seen at all. Her funnells slope back to the stern beneath the landing platform on top.
