First thing this morning I was warned for Al Hayat Helouan Convalescent Hosp.Pay a flying visit to dad to let him know  &  to get some more gear.

The journey out was very interesting first 1 hour tram from Mena to Bab-el-louk station   &  then 1 hour in a very slow train from Bab-el-louk to Helouan, 10 mins march to El Hayat.It is a very big concern several Hundred Australians are housed here but too much like a prison.
