 1917 JANUARY 
 16 TUESDAY 
 Fine &amp; frosty all day. Cleaning 
 harness all day. Got word 
 that I was to go up to the 
 firing line with a G.S. waggon 
 tomorrow, but it was cancelled 
 later. I wish I could have gone 
 as this place is getting very 
 monotonous. I have come to 
 the conclusion I was not 
 meant to to travel, but to stop 
 at home all my life. I would 
 give anything to get back 
 home again &amp; get a start 
 on my own home; &amp; yet if I got 
 the chance I could not go, till 
 I had seen this business through. 
 Got a parcel of tobacco today 
 but dont know who its from, unless 
 its from Maimie Hill.
