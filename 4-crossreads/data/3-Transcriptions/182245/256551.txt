<p>1917 FEBRUARY</p>
<p>5 MONDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; Sunny. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>all morning &amp; out exercising</p>
<p>horses in afternoon. Lieut</p>
<p>Rourke took over the</p>
<p>waggon lines from Capt</p>
<p>Campbell. They are not</p>
<p>loking forward to the change</p>
<p>either as Capt Campbell</p>
<p>had altered a lot since he</p>
<p>came to France. He has</p>
<p>lost a lot of his queeny</p>
<p>ways ect &amp; is more like</p>
<p>a man. Things very</p>
<p>quiet on the line. We</p>
<p>were all called out to draw</p>
<p>ammunition after tea. One</p>
<p>team had to take a load to</p>
<p>the Battery &amp; our team was</p>
<p>the unlucky one. Saw</p>
<p>Warren &amp; the boys up there</p>
<p>&amp; they were all well.</p>
