 Wednesday July 4th Raining nearly all day. It is very muddy round the camp. Had a very busy time in the store stock taking, &amp; giving the whole place a "spring cleaning". Received a pck from Australia, which was sent over a year ago, &amp; was addressed to Egypt. It only contained a pr of socks, but they are very acceptable, as nearly all my others have shrunk away that much that I have a struggle to put them on. Feeling crook tonight. 
 Thursday July 5th Very sick today. Had hardly any sleep last night. I have terrific pains in my sides, back, &amp; chest. Went on sick parade &amp; the Dr ordered me to hospital, but later it was found that the hospital was full, so I had to go back to bed in the hut. Spent a very miserable day. Received another late parcel from Mrs Nelson, it contained two cakes of soap, three handkerchiefs &amp; a tin of ginger. 
 Friday July 6th Rained slightly this morning, but came out clear this afternoon. We do not see near so many airoplanes here now as we used to last year. It is a daily occurrence to see them over the camp though. Everything is fresh &amp; the grass nice &amp; green after the rain. There are a good few wild flowers out too.
