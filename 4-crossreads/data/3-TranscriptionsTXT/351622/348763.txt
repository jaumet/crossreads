9 January 1916 SunDisembarked at 9 a.m. & boarded train for an unknown destination finally arriving after eight hours travelling at Tel-el-Kebir. I might say that we travelled in animal trucks during this long journey. All the boys happy & singing. Scotty gets on his bag-pipes.
10 January 1916 MonA most glorious day & we received our big Xmas mail. I received 15 letters. Had no parade before dinner. Broke camp & hunted Vere up. What a meeting it was & how glad I was to see him. Sorry we could not commemorate the meeting with a glass of the best. Getting camp in order in afternoon.
