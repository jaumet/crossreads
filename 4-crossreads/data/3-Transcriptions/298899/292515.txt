<p>Things fairly quiet as we left. Arrived at the camp just before lunch but managed to have a sponge over and change of underclothing first &amp; my word what a relief it was. I felt a new man being further stimulated by the receipt of a large mail. Walked into Reninghelst at night.</p>
<p>Wednesday 3rd October   Had a day of rest &amp; it was much appreciated. Managed to write a few letters owing a long time. Disturbed at night by guns posted near firing at aircraft.</p>
<p>Thursday 4th October  Did my washing &amp; packed up most of my curios for the post, also went through my panniers etc &amp; got things square again, they being all mixed up with A Section gear. At midday word came that B &amp; C sections tent subdivision had to report to No. 3 Canadian &amp; No 17 British C.C.S. for duty so we packed up &amp; reported about 6 p.m. B to the Canadians C to the British</p>
