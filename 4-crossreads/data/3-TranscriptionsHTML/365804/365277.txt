<p>POSTCARD<br/>PARK HOUSE CAMP, SALISBURY.</p>
<p>Regards to Byrne</p>
<p>Camped here on arrival from Australia, pretty surroundings but very cold and incessant rain. Have seen Les Williams U/S for justice and my brothers (2) Had lunch with Lionel Jaques and Jack Scott of the 19th  in London the  latter spoke very nicely of Arthur and poor Alan Blacket . Am off again soon.<br/>Chas G. [indecipherable]</p>
