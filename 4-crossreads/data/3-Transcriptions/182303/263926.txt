<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This rare pamphlet given to me by Ray Heaps who died on the 8th May, 1963, I now present to the Mitchell Library in memory of Ray.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;War Historian C. E. W. Bean, in the early days of the war, had criticised the drinking habits and character of the Australian Soldier in the press of that time, (World War 1) and this reply from an Australian Soldier in Egypt was produced in satirical vein against such criticism. It is inscribed on the back by Ray Heaps and is dated 20th March, 1915.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ray - Born on the 7th August, 1895, was christened Horatio Spencer Heaps, and was the son of A.W. Heaps the well known violin maker of Sydney. Enlisting in the 1st A. I. F. on the 4th August, 1914, he saw service on Gallipoli and in France, where he was wounded and badly gassed, ultimately being discharged medically unfit. He was an invalid for a number of years.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His number was 516, and he was awarded the Military Medal, London Gazette 66 dated 2/5/1918.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>E.A. Crome.</p>
