On an expedition to visit schools in Cairo that I may receive information as to how they manage such work under the ministry of Education in Egypt.  The Minister is here styled "His Excellency".  Dr David Dunlop - No doubt a Scotchman - is adviser to the department.  One finds educated men from North Britain holding important positions of trust all over the British Empire.  Their solidity, reliability, cautiousness, and knowledge fit them well for the posts. It must be humiliating in their thinking moments, if they have any, for the highly placed Egyptians, the Sultan (The meaning of the word here should be altered) and others to have at each elbow a man, foreigner, who advises upon every act, & who can veto, if necessary, each one, backed as he is by the strong arm of a foreign government.  At the present moment the ruling power is England.  Sir Hy. McMahon, (mayhap of Irish extraction), with General Maxwell, now rule in this land, over which there is a Sultan and a parliament.  Of the latter institution I must seek some information.  An Australian is no judge of the Egyptian frame of mind & thought.  The race here, native to the soil, has been subject to so many vicissitudes adown 8000 years, that a submissive attitude to what comes has probably been developed, a resulting philosophy making them content and able to accomodate themselves without much inconvenience to the change of rulers.  There have been advisers since long before the date when Pharae promoted Joseph, of the many-coloured coat, as the man to govern throughout the valley of the Nile and its surroundings. 
 Waiting am I for a seat in an ambulance to take me to Cairo.  Somewhat sorry am I that I chose to wait.  But here is Jerrom saying: "ready!" 
 25-3-15. Yesterday was used up by me in visiting at the Ministry, seeing through a primary governmental school, & the Christian Brothers, French, school, St. Josephs.
