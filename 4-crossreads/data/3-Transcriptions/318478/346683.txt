<p>Will you kindly arrange with H.Q. Horseferry road Pay Master's Office that my wife Mrs. Lambert 25 Glebe Place, Chelsea be paid <strike>a separation</strike> an allottment out of my pay, amounting to &pound;1.0.0 per diem.  I suggest that you might arrange that she receives this allottment fortnightly, that is &pound;14.0.0 every two weeks.  This arrangement to come into force on or about 1st March and made by fortnightly <u>regular</u> payments.</p>
<p>I further beg you to notify the paymaster at Cairo or Cairo through H.Q. Horseferry Rd. that I have made this arrangement.  I take it that the allottment would be sent to my wife in the form of a cheque.</p>
<p>So far the journey has been very enjoyable compared to my first sojourn in the East.</p>
<p>I have just seen Gullett &amp; Mr. W.H. Hughes at the Majestic, they both looked optimistic.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
