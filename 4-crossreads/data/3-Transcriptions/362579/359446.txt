<p>My dearest Moth.   &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>You will see by above address that I'm in England   &amp;  at a different spot, to the one I expected to be. Well, such is life in the Army &ndash; Must tell you of my movements.</p>
<p>Sunday last in the  afternoon went to Southwell Gardens to see sister Pilkington   &amp;  while there told I was to take charge of it until about 26th November. Thought it too good to be true. Monday morn went to station to see Kelly off   &amp;  felt rather sad at not returning with her to France but think I am wise to stay in England for this winter.</p>
