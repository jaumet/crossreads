Thursday Sept 27thUp at 3.30 this morning, & it was cold getting out too. Had breakfast at 4 am. 90 out of the alphabetical order of A's & B's marched out at 4.30 am. They went to make up the full train load from Monte Video. We fell in at 6 am, & after the roll call, receiving of rations, & boat tickets, we marched out at 7.30 am. The Verne Band played us down to Portland Railway station. entrained at Portland & left at 9 am. It was a very long train & necessitated two engines to pull it.
We had about 25 minutes at Exeter, where a cup of tea & a bun was supplied to us, by the Mayoress & committee of Exeter. Altogether it was a very nice train ride. Arrived in Plymouth about 5.20 p.m. detrained & went aboard the "Suevie". Seems to be a very nice boat. It tonage is about 13,000 tons, & can do about 12 knots. There are about 1400 troops on board. I am at 57 table on D. deck. Of course everything is in a muddle for the first. Issued with two blankets & a hammock, but as I could never sleep in a hammock I will have to sleep on the floor.
