Saturday 1 July 1916A glorious day, clear & sunny so that the ground dried up well. Had another very quiet day & got together some field flowers to press & send home. In the evening was another great flight of planes, 14 being up at one time, & a scrap between 2 of Fritz's & some of ours enlivened proceedings, terminating quickly in the Germans descending & disappearing. The control that the airmen have over their machines is marvellous.As soon as it became dark a relief from one of the other companies came along & took over, enabling us to march back another mile or so to a large billet on the main road, still well within shell fire. Here we are able to sleep in our pyjamas, a very great treat after the last 2 or 3 weeks when we have had to be in our clothes - & boots & putties - all the time. Settled in bed soon after midnight.
