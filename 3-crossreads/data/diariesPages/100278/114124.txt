I saw a great armoured train and engine here and mounted on 2 enomorous steel trucks were 2 big guns. 1, 12 inch howitzer and 1, 9.2 naval gun, they had been firing in to Baupaume, the howitzer throws a shell weighing 880 lbs the 9.2 one 380 lbs, both nice things to be away from when they explode.
The boys finished the job about 3 oclock and we formed up and marched home again or rather limped home for practically all our boots were ruined and nails were sticking into our feet, I know they made mine bleed, and we had no chance of getting any new boots for a few days 
9th Moved off to the same place again this morning at 6.30. the weather looks to have taken up a bit its not wet at any rate, I had a charge of the coy this morning for there were no officers
