<p>Wednesday, 21 July, 1915<br/>Still out in the stream all day long troopships arrived and at night seven went out loaded up with Kitchener's Army we had an exciting experience to-day.  As we were the participants of a collision, a Troopship the Ajax was going astern of us and in doing so grazed our port anchor ripping off a large plate of the Ajax stern, we escaped without a scratch.  The Ajax is ill fated as she was direct hit at Gallipoli by shells.</p>
<p>Thursday, 22 July, 1915<br/>This is like prison we have all spent our money &amp; cannot get more and although there is leave, everyone of us have to prowl about the boat with nothing to do but growl at our delay as we have had official orders for Gallipoli.  All mail from Aust during the day our most welcome diversion.  Eight large transports left at night for the Dardanelles they were packed with troops.  It seems old Achi will not be long now.  Three boats came in from Aust to-day with reinforcements.</p>
