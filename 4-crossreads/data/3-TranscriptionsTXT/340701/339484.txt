 Sunday 13-5 All members of the 4th Div. left the mill today.  I believe the 4th is going North.  Heard today that at Bullecourt our 2nd Div. were massed in the trenches preparatory to attacking at 4.15 A.M.  Fritz must have "smelt a rat" for he opened a Bombardment just &frac14; of an hour before our curtain fire was timed to start.  Our Guns replied &amp; our Infantry went over but the curtain fire did not creep forward as expected with the result that the first wave was blocked.  wave after wave came on until 7 or 8 waves were amassed behind our Barrage. Fritz artillery &amp; machine guns pasting them all the time at last the push of the rear waves pushed the leading ones into our own curtain fire.  A few days later we got some of our own back.  Fritz planned a stunt it is believed &amp; when everything was ready sent up his S.O.S. for his Artillery.  By a wonderful coincidence his S.O.S. &amp; ours were the same &amp; our Artillery opened up immediately with disastrous results for Fritz.
