1919Marchon a march we passed him shovelling manure so we all cheered him.The people in this part of Belgium are known as Walloons.  They detest "les Flamants" - the Flemish - who live near the coast, & speak French, in preference to speaking the Flemish tongue.One day I took a walk to Walcourt - about 6 Kilos by road & 5 K by an old railway track. (all the rails & sleepers had been taken up).  I think that the line had been used in connection with a mine hereabouts -[Picture postcard - Panorama of Walcourt]
