<p>26-2-17<br/>we had buzzer practise this afternoon &amp; the men who failed this morning in the test were taken out &amp; given another chance; As soon as we were dismissed from the 4 oclock parade I made for Heliopolis bought a new cap &amp; tunic had dinner &amp; a shave &amp; went to Abbassia; Met Hills at the sisters ward &amp; went across with her to the Hospital as she is on night duty &amp; came back with Jessie. Met Sister Parson &amp; a lad from the camel corps &amp; the 4 of us came for a walk to Zietoun &amp; back; It was 10.30 before I arrived in Camp &amp; managed to find my own hut without much difficulty; I have had a slight touch of rheumatism in the foot again today.</p>
