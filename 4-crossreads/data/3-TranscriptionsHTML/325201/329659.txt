<p>June 16th<br/>9.30 pm<br/>Abasan el Kabir<br/>There is no doubt that my nerves are not all that they should be. Tonight I am very apprehensive of gas as the wind is just right for it.<br/>It is probably very unprobable but I can't get the idea out of my head.<br/>Very welcome rumours though unfortunately only rumours, that we, that is, all first contingent men are going to be relieved this summer.<br/>The day after tomorrow we go down to the beach so will be packing up tomorrow.</p>
