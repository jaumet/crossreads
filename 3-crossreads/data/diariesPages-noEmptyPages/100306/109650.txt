Needle Tr. B Camp
6/1/17 An uneventful day at Needle. Relieved by 23rd. at 7.30 pm returned to C Camp. Good to get letters.
7/1/17 Quiet day in Camp
8/1/17 Dr. Pedler went into Albert with a limber to buy goods for a regimental canteen which should be popular with the men as they get paid today. Most of them away at baths during the day and on fatigue at night. Went to BHQ during morning to an interesting lecture on counter battery work by Col. Pritchard DSO. General Smyth there with his tunic ablaze with ribbons headed by the V.C. A good lecture showing to what a science gunnery air work is now reduced. Being a cold day spent most of it indoors with phonograph going on opera music. Unearthed a familiar tune in "Madame Sherry" an old Casino chant. Find that men will not look after things themselves. For instance we got about 200 Tommy cookers after much trouble and nearly all were left in the trenches when the Battalion came out. Turned into bed very early and slept soundly through a cold night. There was a light snowstorm
