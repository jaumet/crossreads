<p>No one spoke and they didn't find out till this morning. Now "Lady Barratt" has to have a heel-rope on in case she gets loose again.<br/>She kept me awake for about 3 hours and she missed my bivouac (<strike>an</strike>  a waterproof sheet spread on flag poles) by only a couple of inches several times. And she wound up her performance by drinking some one's water in a bucket which the fellow had carried through the sand about half a mile and eating a couple of loaves of bread.</p>
<p><u>10th Dec</u> 1916 Gererat SUNDAY</p>
<p>I went out with a special patrol to several places on ahead where it was reported "Increased enemy activity" we started off well protected by a screen thrown out in front we went to &ndash; and beyond &ndash; where the enemy were reported but no signs of Turks were observed at ABU ARTAA, EL MURRA, &amp; UM ZUGHLA. All was clear the last named place is about 10 miles further out than Gererat: portions of the town of El Arish were plainly visible. We started back for camp about 4 oclock and finished the journey in the dark. We were coming along at a good fast pace when a figure on top of a sand dune in front called out "Halt!" We <u>did</u> halt too. There is no mistaking that challenge. "Who are you?" "Friend"! "Advance one and be recognized!"</p>
