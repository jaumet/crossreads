Jan 29th At Bazentin awaiting leave but still no news of its re opening
Jan 30, 31, Feb 1st, 2nd Still waiting. Weather perfect but cold with clear sunny days moonlight nights.
Feb 3rd Tonight I visited Pozieres had a look over old ground. A battery of 9.2's is where Jack [indecipherable]'s grave is things are as safe as houses.
Feb 8th Weather still very cold and frosty. Papers say that it is the coldest winter for a generation. Fritz shelled about  mile from H.D. S to day.
Feb 9th Leave passes arrive I move to J.H.Q. where I find out that Leave has been stopped again
Feb 11th Last night the 4th 5th Battalions had a raid which was an utter failure. Our casualties out of 100 men were 50 wounded and 25 or about killed and missing. Our H.D.S. is most inconvenient and our colonel most incapable. He got most flustered and in no way can compare with our ex colonel.
Feb 14th Went for a walk to Edwards Post to show Perkins round. A stunt is expected in a few days he is in charge of reserve squads. Came home through High Wood where there are many monuments to the 1st Division which took place in most of the fighting there. There are 5 or 6 stranded tanks there they are being cleaned in anticipation of being used again.
Feby 15th Tonight we were warned that an aeroplane raid was to be attempted by Fritz on Rail heads.
Febry 16th This morning I was awakend by bursting bombs anti aircraft shells Fritz caught a big ammunition dump this morning caused great explosions to happen all day. The damage must have been great.
Feby 24th Everything lately has been quiet on the front the casualties have been slight. The good weather has gone now it is now muddy again. Considering the late frosty weather the weather now is warm
