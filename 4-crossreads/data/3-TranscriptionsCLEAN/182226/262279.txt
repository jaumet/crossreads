Tuesday 14 September, 1915
Very dull & cold. Very lively artillery duel, our guns firing about 6 times to the Turks one. We got a burst of shrapnel on our hill from goodness knows where as the Turks can never get a shell there it must have been a badly timed shell from out own guns.
Have had a long guard to do, have been on duty 4 out of 18 hours it is too much as we have to go on fatigue work, carrying water when we came off.
We are getting all this extra work because so many men are sick.
