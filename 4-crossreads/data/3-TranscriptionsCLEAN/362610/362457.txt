Tuesday 29 August 1916A dull wet day : heavy showers occasionally. Was called for at 9 a.m. by an A.M.C. motor & with several others was taken thro' Poperinghe to a large town named Cassel where an army Gas School is situated. It was an interesting ride thro' long avenues of elms & poplars, across the border & back into France. Had a good morning dealing with the new type of gas mask, then had lunch at a very nice place & stayed there for some time waiting for the rain to abate. Found parcels from Evie & from Lawry waiting for me & was glad to have them : a real treat, the excitement of opening them & then the pulling out of one article & then another. A Gas alarm at night.
