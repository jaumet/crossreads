<p>As usual there are plenty of our planes hanging about.</p>
<p>Things have been fast &amp; furious this afternoon talk about mortar bombardments well we have had them this afternoon but for every bomb &amp; shell the Germans shot over they got 6 in return quite easily, we blew their barb-wire to pieces &amp; levelled their parapets in places but the greater part of the bombardment fell on the 2nd and 3rd lines it must have been a perefect Hell there, large pieces of timber &amp; etc were flying back all the while from Fritzs trenches, our bombardment stopped as suddenly as it started &amp; then old Fritz lets fly but every time he shot one of his big Minnewerfers over our boys</p>
