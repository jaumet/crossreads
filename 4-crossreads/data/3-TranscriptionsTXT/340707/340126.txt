 25-5-19 All this morning I wandered about in the glorious wilderness garden making plans of it even the [indecipherable] tree &amp; shrubs. 
 In the afternoon we go over to Foxholm crossing meadows yellow as mustard with buttercups &amp; through a belt of ancient timber growing on a very steep slope which has cloud like blue mists apparently rolling up its side. This fairy cloud are really millions of little blue bell which in big patches here are without number &amp; were well worth the visit. 
 Foxholm is an old Tudor built house in the middle of a  space  clearing in a plantation. The forest has been cleared a little too much round house &amp; at the present time is neither thick enough to be wild &amp; too thin enough to be beautiful. I see some old birch with their white bark, with little round leaves. The lime seems the best of the deciduous here, for it grows fast &amp; does not rob the ground under it like the beech. The elm grows too slowly. 
 26-5-19 All leave today for London except myself &amp; I am going the other way
