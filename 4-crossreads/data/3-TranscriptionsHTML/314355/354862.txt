<p>June 23<br/>227.<br/>To St. Omer &ndash; to Cassel Station in a French lorry &amp; then the leave train to St. Omer.</p>
<p>A day's wandering about the town, and an afternoon lazing and half-heartedly sketching of the Cathedral.  Back at Cassel for tea &ndash; and there bought de Vere Stacpoole's "The Lady Killer", a facinating little novel of the bizarre, read it on the way back, lying in a wheatfield.</p>
<p>But the most enjoyed hour of the day was the last 500 yards across the closely growing crops to H.Q., the sun had set behind Cassel Hill, and the rich day's greens of the hill silhouetted against a great screen of more grey &ndash; and above it most wounderful blue-greens, looking up to the camp's line of trees, a faint line of mist crossed them:  at first I thought it was my eyes' mistake, then I saw the ground mists slowly and faintly rising all about and around.  The quiet of the fields and the beauty of their sombre colouring, and one of the Boche H.V. guns opened on Steenvoorde.</p>
<p>No mail:  disappointed at not finding Waugh's book of poetry.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tom the M.S.M.</p>
<p>June 24<br/>228.<br/>At 12.30 a.m. a stunt by two platoons each of the 2nd &amp; 3rd:  successful, and 11 prisoners and 8 M.Guns taken.  On the night of the 22 200 strong the Boche attacked and even though he put down a 45 minutes barrage, he failed to reach our line.  This morning's stunt opens the way to a stunt for Meteren.</p>
<p>No mail and rain, again this evening to St. Marie Cappel:  the French band again for a good and enjoyed hour.</p>
<p>Yesterday Scott outlined and commenced a fine sketch of the "Maps" Hut, it makes a good subject and in his sketch he's been splendidly successful.</p>
<p>Laying large scale map of the Divisional Sector.</p>
<p>Good news from the Italian front wires through today.</p>
