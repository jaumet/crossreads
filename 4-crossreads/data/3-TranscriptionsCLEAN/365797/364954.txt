receiving you well, & Dene is fretting daily at the delay in joining you all. He has passed the schools of instruction in both musketry & bombing, & in the latter scored especially with his book work, the notes were A.1. & illustrated by diagrams, which were passed round for the admiration of all the officers, & got high marks.
Dorothy has started typewriting. Ethel got her in at the same place as she works, Wacey & Pincombe in Hunter St, She only gets 10/- a week at first, but is being taught.

We had a great surprise one morning, Bruce Earl came down at breakfast time, to borrow a rug. It was for Auntie Isett & Dulcie who were off by steamer same day. Walter shouted them a trip to Colombo & back!  Bruce is still in solitary exile at the Tuggerah farm. You heard of course that Dulcie's engagement with Rowland Harrison is broken off?
