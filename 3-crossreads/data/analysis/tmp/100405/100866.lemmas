 Electrolyt Poetri . If the gas is out , the maiden said , then would the electr light ? That 's someth I ca n't tell said I , although perhap it might . Well , if a farmer mow his lawn , what doe a dynamo ? Again I shook my helpless head and said I did n't know . I ve often wonder , she remark , how much the coffe urn ? As much , said I , as the fuel cost , that a fireless cooker burn . But whi , she ask , when it 's full of dust , is the vacuum cleaner ? Whi that 's the same , I then explain , as a fat girl who is Lena . For quit some time I rambl on with daffodil forlorn , While alack , I turn around , and found the maid had gone . War Bread Monday 's bread is dark in hue . Tuesday 's bread is tough to chew . Wednesday 's bread is wors than coke . Thursday 's bread make papa choke . Friday 's bread 's like ammunit . After Saturday 's bread you call in the physician . But the bread that is brought on the Sabbath day , Is enough to make ani old atheist pray .
