<p>Friday 28th June 1917 [1918]<br/>Am very happy in my work &amp; giving every possible energy to it.  Men appreciate my efforts as to clean shirts, ties, etc.  Dr. Wilson a very charming woman &amp; a pleasure to talk to her.  Miss Low, home sister, has a hard expressionless face &amp; our harem is simply filthy, bad food &amp; dirty quarters.  Both Matrons evidently regard us as immoral women &amp; try to suppress us in every possible way as to late passes etc.</p>
