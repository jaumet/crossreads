<p>outside the station &amp; I am accosted by a rough driver in high brogue but I prefer walking. After some distance find a tram going my way &amp; get to Kingsbridge intent on catching 9.10 am train to Killarney  Meet Chant here,    &amp; we are not going till to-morrow. Legge &amp; Palliser are sitting in Hotel Ivanhoe as I arrive &amp; their surprise is undoubted. After writing some P/C's we set forth &amp; do the city. Have lunch at the hotel, visit Stephen's Green spend an hour in Sackville St viewing the damage done in the riot, climb Nelson's monument, from which we get a fine view of the whole of Dublin  Under Chant's guidance we view Guiness' Brewery &amp; are greatly impressed. The immensity of this manufactury is marvellous, really a town on it's own. More tips for the conductor &amp; off to Phoenix Park  take some photos, gather some Shamrocks &amp; back home to a good dinner. Meet a gentleman who gives me intricate details of the riot  &amp;</p>
