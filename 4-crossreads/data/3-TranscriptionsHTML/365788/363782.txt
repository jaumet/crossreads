<p>Mena Camp<br/>8 miles from Cairo<br/>31st Jan 15<br/>My own dear Sister<br/>As I write, I am on night duty in one of our Hospital tents situated about &frac14; of a mile from the great pyramid. We are camped on the sand of the Desert &amp; as you may judge are not too comfortable. We hope we wont be kept here very long, but of course must put up with conditions such as they are.<br/>Poor old Will feels very homesick I think <strike>as</strike> &amp; I myself do also. How are you all? I must thank Irene for the nice Xmas Card she sent me. Hope you both think my left-handed writing is improving.<br/>How very lovely it will be when we all come together once more after this awful war is over<br/>Tonight I went round to the Infantry camp &amp; saw Stan Meek. I am trying to get him a Transfer into our unit &amp; Will is helping me. Will is Major in Charge of the whole Camp, our part I mean. There are about 20,000 Twenty thousand Australian Troops camped here. It is a wonderful sight. Sister Stobo has been very kind indeed to me. She is a very fine woman. It is now 1.30 AM &amp; our hours are from 9.P.M till 6.30 AM. Very much love to you all<br/>Ever your loving brother<br/>Fred</p>
