<p>Just behind my dugout we have 4, 240 lbs mortars built in ready for action, but they don't care about firing them, they reckon they make too big a crater, when we attacked at "Pozeries." They put 7 over all at equal distances between our trenches &amp; the German's, they were for the men to take cover in between the rushes on the way across, the men got in them alright but they had great difficulty in climbing out for the next rush, &amp; no wonder for the average crater from these monsters measures something like 30 ft across &amp; is easily 12 or 15 ft in depth.<br/>One of our officers Capt Price has a battery of 6 rifles grenades &amp; he is firing them all day long, he gives them no rest from them<br/>7th.  Yesterday evening Captain McKenzie Jack Price &amp; I reconnoitred a piece of open ground at the rear of our firing</p>
