  
 April 17, 18 66. In the first hours of this morning, a 4th Batt. lad disembowelled, he died at 8, conscious till an half hour before, he told us he'd write to us from Blighty and if he got to Australia, he meant to stay there.  Alongside him we dressed another man whose arm was shot away:  who having his arteries tied, let a hard gasp escape him.  With pain on his own face, the 4th lad stiffly turned his head, "You've got all my sympathy Dig!" and he closed his eyes and his mind wandered again on getting home.  Slowly he died, occasionally he'd ask again for another sip of Coffee, then a rambled sentence, then "Gee, am going dopey, that stuff, is it?"  Then, "This ammunition getting heavy, Jack" and oblivion.

 April 18 67.  a.m. A Padre in brings the rumour of France decorating the 4th Division with the Legion of Honour.  What a bonser distinction, and a well earned one. 
 68.  p.m. A mail up today:  from the T.B.C. Frankeau's "Judgment of Valhalla".  From home, a long letter of Mother's from Narrabeen of February 17 and of Betty's from Woollahra of Jan. 31. 
 April18 Mother writes again after a long silence of Geoff's enlisting .. 
 "I have given Geoff my consent to join the Flying Corps:  so I expect him any day to let me know if he intends going:  I thought and thought about it, and felt I was not fair to him, as I have an idea how others think of it, and I have heard people talk about boys who have gone - only sons of widows, and then there's always the feeling of shirking:  so I settled it in my mind, and if he really must go he may feel free". 
 So he'll have his desire at last:  and he'll know what a bonser race he belongs to. 
 "Betty", Mother goes on, "has her first sweetheart:  last week she had Aileen Foley to stay, and this boy came out on Sunday for tea - the reason to take Aileen home, but there were great preparations to meet him, and when he arrived I saw where the attraction lay.  Bett is very funny and last Wednesday, last Wednesday he called to take Betty home for tea.  She has gone to Burwood this week and he lives at Strathfield.  He is a nice looking lad, goes to Newinton [Newington],
