I was signalling on the Battn HQ to several companies, when the Signal officer came up, and gave me a message to send through - It read "Armistice signed at 10 am today". I stopped the other practice message, and sent this. All the other sigs threw their flags high in the air and came running in to see if it was dinkum. Needless to say, there was no more practice that day. In the afternoon the Colonel had a parade and announced it officially, but warned us that the war was not all over. he also said that discipline would be relaxed a little. I am very glad to say that not a man in the Battalion was drunk that night - chiefly owing to the fact that no one had any money. The froggies were very pleased, and greeted us with "Le guerre fini", but on the whole, they took it very calmly. We were paid on the following day, and the day afterwards, several men were fined for being drunk. On the night of the 11th one of Lena Ashwells
