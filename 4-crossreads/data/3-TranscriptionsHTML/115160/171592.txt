<p>Dear Bess,</p>
<p>Your letters of 17 Sept and 24 Oct now to hand, the first for several mails past.</p>
<p>So George Ravell will be married by now. &nbsp;I&nbsp;get mixed up with them, except for old Tom. &nbsp;Who is going to sail Kismet this season: is it being sailed in their name?</p>
<p>I see you have taken on dancing again. &nbsp;I hear the Tango is all the rage. &nbsp;There have been a few hops here, but it is painful to try to dance in these boots of ours&nbsp;on a floor as rough&nbsp;as sandpaper. &nbsp;Nevertheless the villagers go nap on them, for for four years and more they have had to put up with many privations and much severity.</p>
<p>Are you still down in the Cashier&#39;s Office? &nbsp;You will like it better down there than up above, where the atmosphere is always thick with work. &nbsp;You can tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
