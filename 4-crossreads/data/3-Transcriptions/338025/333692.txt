<p>Monday 21st May 1917<br/>Left camp about 9am for Dump at Favreuil.<br/>In the morning we loaded motor waggons with empty cases.<br/>In the afternoon we finished the staking and cleaning up.<br/>At dinner time I had a walk through Fritz grave yard and one strange thing I noticed was that all the dates were cut of the crosses.<br/>[several lines crossed out evident on next page]</p>
