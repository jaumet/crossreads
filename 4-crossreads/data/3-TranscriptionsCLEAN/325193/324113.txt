  
 June 10 1917 We have just been told to get ready to hand over to the other Company at 10 A.M.  that makes it all told from the time we went in until we came out (53 howers). Today is October 3rd and I believe we go in to the line for tomorrow to                                             make a name for our selves.  we have been properly equiped for the ocasion I hope it doesn't last as long as the Massines.
