Friday 17 August 1917
[The following paragraph crossed through.]Went Alexandria & drew some money an expensive place this in one way as Officers are expected to be extravagant in many ways.
Feeling a bit better but will be here a few days yet.
[The following paragraph crossed through]Post this to let you know, there is nothing the matter with me & a boat sails on Sunday, love to all. I sent another little Water Color & some snapshots.
