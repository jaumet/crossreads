In order that too many questions should not be asked us regarding where we had got the surplus sandbags we covered the sides of the dug-out with scrub. Of an evening we had quite a number of visits from other chaps who could not rest themselves in their own dug-out. Sitting there, yarning amongst the thick smoke from tobacco, there being no outlet for it, we spent many a pleasant evening in this way. "W" came into our dugout this morning and made the remark that he had never seen snow before and that he was not enamoured of the experience of winter time in this part of the globe. We were put on fatigue duty this forenoon brushing the snow from off the tents. Rather a cold job it was too.

To get to the H.Q.s we had to climb up high hills and go down into deep gullies. The wet weather made this kind of walking very difficult indeed. At times we were knee deep in mud. We were right in the trenches
