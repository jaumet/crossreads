February 1915Wednesday 17Had a good lay in. The Brigadier gave us a holiday for the rest of the week. Blankets taken up on the hill to be aired and dried as the dew (which is very heavy on a clear night) had wet them considerably when we were on the last night of the bivouac. Capt. King one of our staff officers looking up the price of things at the canteen for the benefit of the men. He is a great man to look after the men. Stew for dinner paid for the last fortnight's wages of 136 piastres or 28/-
Thursday 18Mess orderlies had to scrub tables down as Lieut. Cook complained of the way in which they were usually left by mess orderlies. General leave granted. I took a tram into Cairo. From there I took a car to Heliopolis & saw Arthur in the Palace Hotel which is now the Base Hospital. His eye is still bad. He is afraid he will be sent back to Australia. He says he will not go back. Went to his camp to get a letter for him but could not. Left him about 8 PM. Got a motor car from Cairo to Mena Camp. Very cold night
