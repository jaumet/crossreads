<p>Dear Mum,<br/>This is just a P.C. as the Lights have blown out &amp; it is nearly dark. I expect to go on Leave to see Aunt Annie on Tuesday or Wednesday so I'll drop you a line on the way when I've arrived there. Tommy Williams (Dad will remember our Little Pay Clerk) &amp; I rode about 20 miles on our Bikes To-day. It is pouring with rain now. I'll have some supper &amp; go to bed real early tonight. Ellis is away on leave at a Beautiful Place called Bournemouth. He returns on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Love to all. Letters following.  Harry</p>
