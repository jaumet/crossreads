27/9/15 Sunsets viewed from this height are wonderful. Last night most magnificent violet shades. The sun going down behind the peaks of Imbros Samothrace. Stood with Doctor watching for half an hour The shades changing each second.
Afternoon normal sniping and enemies replies. He has established a new sniper post which unfortunately commands this spot. Very hot fire about lunch from there. Cooks stirred up round the fire and some too close to be comfortable. A pitch dark night but the bombardment of Suvla position remarkable sight. The whole range lit up by the bursting shells and the crash of the discharge Flash of big guns like a sheet of flame leaping out into the darkness and the bursting of the shell cast a glare up into the sky. Heavy rumble from down south at Cape Hellas. The guns have been roaring without ceasing for 48 hours now. The enemy very active in front and the rifle fire heavy. The men cursing because all the fun is on our flanks Bed 2056
