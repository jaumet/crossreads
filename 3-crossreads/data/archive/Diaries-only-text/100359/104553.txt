We put our packs on a waggon which took them as far as the park in Ismalia. This is a pretty little town, big shady trees everywhere, and the gardens are very pretty. We sat down near the pond in the gardens, in which fish were swimming around. We took off our packs and boots and had a glorious loaf for an hour or so. It was a very pleasant change after having been stuck out in the desert so long. Then Mac and I went into town and bought some tinned fruit and biscuits and lemonade and then we had a jolly good feed. Mac and I had a glass of nice cold beer, which went down well.

They knew we only did it for a joke, as they laughed about it, and enjoyed it as much as we did. We got into Camp at about 5, just in time for tea. The tents were pitched, which was a jolly good job, and after tea we were not long out of bed and I slept as sound as a rock, after a very rough busy day.
Monday 29th
For S.P. again. We built up an old incinerator with the assistance of an Arab bricklayer, and started the old game going again. The 29th Band is playing just outside our tent. If there is one thing that makes soldiering worth while, it is to march behind a good band playing a stirring tune. Then you see the chaps chests swell out like pouter pigeons.
