10/9/18 
A quiet and wet day. C. Brumby on his way to join 8th Bn came in and I phoned for Jack. We foregathered and had a pleasant yarn recalling old times. Great preparations for G.O.C's inspection on tomorrow ? a Brigadier's inspection only. Our band played at mess. The rain made the camp roads the bivouacs most uncomfortable and wet.
