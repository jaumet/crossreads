<p>Patrolling the Desert (censored lines &amp; verses)<br/>2nd verse.<br/>5th line Small straggling groups of horsemen were also making back,<br/>6th [line] The Turks had caught 'em napping &amp; they'd taken to the track.</p>
<p>3rd verse (entirely)<br/>They were poor old British Tommies, who been camped way out near Hell<br/>In the silent-blazing desert, 'longside some brackish well.<br/>They'd been there to watch old Jacko, &amp; keep him out of bounds<br/>But in tiresome dull existence they'd "forgot" their daily rounds.<br/>So he came in force &amp; caught 'em, unprepared, &amp; taking rest<br/>He smashed 'em up &amp; drove them, in disorder, from their nest.</p>
<p>7th verse (entirely)<br/>First found, a thin old Bedouin sat underneath a palm,<br/>So fetched him under guard behind to see he did no harm.<br/>At noon we struck a Tommies Camp, abandoned but intact,<br/>They'd all cleared out &amp; left it, strange thing but still a fact,<br/>They'd made things pretty comfy here, had beer &amp; wine galore,<br/>No sign of Turk or any fight, or what they'd "squibbed" it for.</p>
<p>15th verse<br/>7th line A poor old Tommy Sergeant who'd been fleeing from his foe,<br/>8th [line] Had stopped there just because it was as far as he could go.</p>
