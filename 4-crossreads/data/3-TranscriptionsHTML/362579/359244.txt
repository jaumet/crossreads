<p>hear something definite.</p>
<p>Received several cards to-day in fact every day thro' the week a couple has come from friends in England   &amp;  France.</p>
<p>Such a pretty card   &amp;  nice note from our dear Colonel of 1st A.S.H. I feel so sorry to think I had not sent him a card but shall write a little note to him telling  how pleased I am to know I'm not forgotten. They are in England   &amp;  if I were unhappy here I should have written and told him to get me back to his Unit again  but really I could not think of doing so now.</p>
<p>I shall be glad when the singlets arrive because I'm really in need of new ones   &amp;  think it would be hard to procure them. I'm awfully sorry that I've been such a fool, in telling you   &amp;  worrying you all about</p>
