7/11/17 Paris
some shopping thereabouts and walked down to the Madeline tube station. Returned to hotel (now much warmer and cheery than last month and had a long wait for nothing before going out to dinner. Was in plain clothes and strolled round the Bourse before going to the Bde de Bonne Nouvelle to the Restaurant Margaux where the 'sole marguery" was as usual quite excellent. Tete a tete little parties here and perfume. Walked slowly down the Bd. Des Italiens to the Opera. Here were people sitting in the phonograph shops listening to music by telephones. Pavement strollers casting their meshes round for passers-by. Old men with young pretty girls ? money covers all! The front tables outside the cafes are now quite deserted and the nip in the air calls for greatcoat. Returned to hotel being tired with this full day and turned in about 10 o'c.
