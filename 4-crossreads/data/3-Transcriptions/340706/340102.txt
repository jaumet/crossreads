<p>20-5-19 (Tues)<br/>Visit tailors in Savile Row &amp; find their prices for uniform is 11 to 12 gns far beyond my purse &amp; then catch 1.15 train to Weybridge which is about 2 &frac12; miles from the Manor House but is nearest station I am met by a South African officer who is staying there &amp; driven in a little cart with a small wee pony just like a big dog.</p>
<p>We pass Brooklands &amp; finally reach the House an old royal hunting lodge used by Ed.II &amp; then presented by James I to his Queen Anne of Denmark who enlarged it. Much of the original building is said to remain but I doubt it. The grounds are beautifully</p>
