Three francs I paid for <strike>the food</strike> these luxuries. So I had a good <strike>tea</strike> supper. Then to bed in the cow shed, a bit of straw for mattress, and great coat for blanket. I fell asleep, <strike>but</strike> At midnight was awakened by the continuous roar of artillery.</p>
<p>May 12th:- Went to mass in the village church this morning. The Altar was smashed, and clerical vestments were scattered <strike>on</strike> about the floor of the sanctuary. Spent the morning rummaging the bedrooms, kitchens, etc of deserted houses. In one house I unearthed a handsome pocket edition of "Paul and Virginia", and among the leaves, I found an old receipt and a lottery ticket.* At 4 P.M. the 20th Reinforcements left Lahoussoye to join the Battalion which was in the line. With a runner to guide us we crossed the wheatfield where I had seen the shells falling yesterday, and later struck a road leading through a hollow to Bonnay.+ Leaving this village <strike>behind us</strike> we climbed the great long hill that stretches between the Ancre and the Somme, from Bray to Corbie.</p>
