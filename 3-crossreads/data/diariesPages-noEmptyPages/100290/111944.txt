1916 July 2
Sunday 
The expected happened. Terrific bombardment of German lines opened up about 9 p. m. continued all night. Billet shook with the concussion. There must have been some damage done somewhere.
Usual duties. Saw W.O. about T B. Informed me that the O. C. would see their respective O's C. personally.
Lettuce salad custard fruit for dinner. Tres bon encore.
Go up to village Donlieu with washing this morn. Just in time to see Grand Fete of Corpus Christi. Decorated street. banners. Procession. adoration of Host. Yellow satin angel. frizzy haired girls if white confirmation dresses. mourning women black coated hatted men. Tres interesting.
