<p>4/10/17 Ypres. De Kneot Fme <br/>At 3.30 am the companies silently filed on to their J.O.T's where they had to lie for two long hours. They were distributed in shell holes. All went well until 5.30 a.m. when the enemy opened up the heaviest of barrages and in our little trench we quaked and closed our eyes. Several times we had direct hits on the parapet and were nearly buried. This barrage was evidently the prelude to an attack, later said to have been timed 15 minutes later than ours. Anyway we found crowds of troops when we did actually go over. Meantime this terrific barrage continued and our guns responded. I was in a dreadful state of nerves and nearly broke down all together as I thought our chaps must be catching it on the tapes and also that they might advance on the sound of our gun fire and so get cut to hell. My whole body was ashake and it took a great effort to pull myself together.</p>
