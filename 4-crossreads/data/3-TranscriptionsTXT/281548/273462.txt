 John Wheat was a torpedoman on the Australian submarine A.E.2.  This diary covers the early days of the submarine and its arrival in Turkish waters to attempt to break through the Dardanelles and gain entry to the Sea of Marmora.  Their eventual capture and life as prisoners of war in Turkey is little known.  Wheat's two failed escape attempts are also documented here. The original is a mixture of typescript and handwritten pages
