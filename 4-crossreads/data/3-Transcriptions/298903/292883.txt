<p>Thursday 20th Feb.  Had a bath, hot shower &amp; otherwise prepared to go away on leave.  At night went to Y.M. to hear a lecture on New Guinea by Chaplain Bartlett &amp; it proved to be one of the finest addresses &amp; incidentally the best defences for missionary work that I have ever heard.  At times he was really thrilling.</p>
<p>Friday 21st Feb.  Telegraphed to London for a room at the Bonnington in the morning afterwards having a long walk, weather beautiful.  After dinner it commenced to rain heavily.  I caught the 4.20 train to London changing at Salisbury where I had tea. Arrived in London at 9p.m. &amp; found my room ready.  Sent off a few letters making appointments for the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Saturday 22nd.  A busy day.  Did a certain amount of shopping, visited Horseferry Rd. &amp; collected 10 of the best from S.M. &amp; Co to help me</p>
