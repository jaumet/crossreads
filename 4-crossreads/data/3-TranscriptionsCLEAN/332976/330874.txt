  
 June 1917 15th   The company were on pontooning again this morning & had the afternoon off as usual. Hard luck came my way to-day-  I had left some photos at Contay when I was there to be developed by a photographer  there  but most unfortunately the M.P.s  got to know of it, with the result that they were sent on to H.Qs who now demand an inquiry into the matter.   This look a serious affair, seeing that cameras are forbidden in France, & may probably mean a court martial for me.    The  I am now awaiting developments, & a report has been sent to C.R.E.
