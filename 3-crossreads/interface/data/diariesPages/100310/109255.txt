5/8/17 Campagne
Sunday and a fine day. Church parade at 10a.m. was held in the Chateau grounds and General Paton attended. After service marched past headed by the band ? rather a good turnout. All the officers then sat for a group photograph by M'selle and we also had a few individual photographs taken as well. She leaves for Paris tomorrow. Stayed at home all the afternoon and had a visit from the CO.23rd Battn Brazenor. A beautiful fine evening and walked in the grounds along the leafy paths. Leon Barbier was in during the afternoon and had a long talk and made a translation of a story in Fantasio. Also talked to M'selle who is bovine like her mother and will be very haggish later on. A quiet and peaceful evening and the War seems very far away indeed. The Band played at mess and sounded preliminarily the "Roast Beef of Old England".
