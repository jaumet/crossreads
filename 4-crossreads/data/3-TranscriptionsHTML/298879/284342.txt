<p>March 1915<br/>Tuesday 9<br/>Feeling a bit better. Doctor Kennedy said I could have soda water.</p>
<p>Wednesday 10<br/>Still feeling better. Eat a piece of bread for the first time since the 27th Feb. Received some letters. They cheer a chap up a lot. The trouble is I cannot answer them   Not getting so much medicine now.</p>
