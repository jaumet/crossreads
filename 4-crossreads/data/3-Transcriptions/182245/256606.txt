<p>1 SUNDAY</p>
<p>Fine till evening &amp; then it</p>
<p>rained heavily for a bit &amp; then</p>
<p>cleared off again. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness ect all day, &amp; got all</p>
<p>mine up to the knocker, for</p>
<p>inspection at 4 pm, but the</p>
<p>inspection did not come off</p>
<p>We could see Old Fritz&#39;s</p>
<p>shrapnell bursting over</p>
<p>Armenti&egrave;res way all day.</p>
<p>They started to shell our</p>
<p>battery out, they knocked the</p>

<p>did no other damage</p>
