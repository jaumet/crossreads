Holdsworthy is merely a camp for preliminary training of recruits. None of us have rifles. The usual period that a recruit spends here is four weeks and at the end of that time he is sent on to Liverpool where he goes through the musketry course and rifle drill &amp;c.,  The time varies considerably though. Those leaving this week have been here for the past ten weeks.<br/>The remount unit are camped opposite us and Mr. Styles is there with them. I have not been able to get across to see him yet.<br/>The German concentration Camp is also near us. About half a mile further on. The German prisoners are employed in clearing the forest, burning off and hauling wood &amp;c. We frequently see gangs of them clad in dungarees and white hats alongside the road cutting and stacking wood.<br/>Tell Vesey I went up to Riverview on Sunday evening and saw Tare.
