James came over to see me and stayed to dinner with me. Afterwards it was met and I rode over to see the dentist at Quesques returning to our football match with the 6th Bde.H.Q. at our ground. This was a mud scramble and our chaps ran over them. Stayed in the mess talking until after mess. Sparrow gave an excellent talk on his trip to the Salvage Works at Calais and the methods they have there for remaking gear. At my billet spent the evening talking to the Lefevre family in bad French and reading aloud with the son from a manual of conversation. A very amusing & instructive night and I am afraid that by talking on I kept the family rather late out of bed.
