<p>&amp; a bowl of sago. We have 4 or 5 of these Field Hosp here on the sides of the hills, they send a man here from the lines before he gets bad &amp; in a couple of days he is back again &amp; in so doing we dont lose so many men who used to get sent to England &amp; Egypt in former days. I will be back to the lines in 3 days so dont worry when you get this.<br/>Well Lizzie dear I will close now with love to Mother Dad R &amp; B &amp; self from your loving brother<br/>Ken<br/>I saw Sister Herbert in Lemnos she's nursing there now, she posted the sheepskin vest in Egypt to me but I havnt got it yet.
