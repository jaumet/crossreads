<p>Zeitourn<br/>Egypt<br/>13th March 1916<br/>My darling Beatrice</p>
<p>So many unexpected changes happen in this military life that it is difficult to know exactly what to do regarding postal arrangements.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago my pay book was altered from 14/- per day back to privates pay on account of losing the R.Q.W.S. position through the ill feeling and lies of a certain officer.</p>
<p>The Major who is befriending me advised that such a proceeding had to take place to accord with the unfortunate happenings and meet requirements of Red-tapism<br/>This Major also informed me that he would see that I was put through in orders as a paid Sergeant again and later on probably further promoted to the position of warrant officer once more and then get back my former pay.</p>
<p>The heartbreaking part of it is that they cabled over stopping the extra money which was going to you dear, and made out that I am now &pound;13.17-0 overdrawn allowing me only 2/- per week till that is paid off. However if promotion comes soon things</p>
