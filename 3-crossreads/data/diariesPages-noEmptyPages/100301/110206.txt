one of our officers got a tin of Petrol spread it all over the ambulance the Huns set fire to it burnt the lot got rid of the beastly smell of dead Huns. 
Our first night was the worst I remember, as we had not been in the trenches very long when we all put to improve the trenches by digging a bit deeper. shell fire was very constant in the next bay to where I was with 4 others, there were, one officer four stretcher bearers 2 signallers,
a shell came got the lot (wounded) the officer got wounded through both wrists the others in different parts of the body well all had to be bandaged up as best we could, that left 4 of us one sentry who got blown down off the firing step two others who had shell shock one chap was crawling on his Hands knees saying Oh where am I, where am I, the other one was silent like a drunken man, useless of course to me
there I was on my pat, with two shell shocks a sentry who did not know where he was either I thanked God when day light came as the trenches were being flattened out as once I looked over the top to see what which direction the shells were coming from there were flashes from directly in front from the right flank when daylight came what was left of us were taken out moved to a trench which was a new one put there to reinforce some other men of another Battalion they were only 33 strong out of a company we were 14 so that made 47 in this trench we were close
