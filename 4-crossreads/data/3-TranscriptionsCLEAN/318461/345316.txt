to Nell, Jack, Carol, Tony, Syd. Arthur, Jean.Raining again makes it miserable went this afternoon 3/- Trip on drag Westminister Abbey a Marvellous Place. Buckingham Palace mostly seeing Horses stables & the state coach weighs 4 1/2 tons & a marvellous carriage, each horses harness costs anything between 100 & 200. No wonder there's taxes etc.The Kings state carriage is simply all gilt & is magnifiacent & his Horses are just it.Going to Theatre tonightrang up Newton go to see him tomorrow at 11 am 60 Belsize Park. (Bus 24.)
Tuesday 31/7/17.went out to see Newton at Belsize Park he was not there saw Mrs Moore had a chat & came into the strand & made appointment for 3 P.M. Am now here Just saw him & he recognised me straight away.Raining like hell Glorious country this Oh that I was back in Sydneywent out by Taxi cost me 4/6 same back by bus 3d The curse of it all is you don't know what bus to take & where it is going to when you do take it.Saw Newton he called for me for 10. ought to be here in a day or so wrote to Maude & Viv.Rumest thing I have struck is the women drinking in the Pubs there are more women than men at it & its quite the custom no one minds it.
