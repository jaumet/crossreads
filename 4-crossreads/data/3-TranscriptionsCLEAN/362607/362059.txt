 Dear Dad, You will be thinking of me at this time & I will of course be thinking of you. I took the afternoon off but did not go anywhere. In fact I did all my Home-work & washed all my clothes to-night as I am going to London on Thursday for a trip. I went into Salisbury on Sunday for a trip on the Bike. The weather is very cool in the mornings & hot during the day. It reminds one of the Egyptian Winter. The leaves  are beginning to fall & the colours are beginning to show so very soon we will have Winter on us again. We rather like the Winter 'cos we can play Hockey. It is lovely on our oval on nice brisk day. Well Dad Dear, I'm writing a P.C. to each of you as I have no news except that we are both in the Best of Health.  Fond Love.  Harry
