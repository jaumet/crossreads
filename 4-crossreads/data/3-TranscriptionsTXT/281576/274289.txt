 Sun. Oct. 7        Bristol Ward Breakfast along.  We had a choice of Fish Cakes or Sausage Rolls.  I had Cakes &amp; with it Tea &amp; Bread &amp; Butter.  At 9, they brought Hot Milk &amp; Bread &amp; Butter along.  During the morning an old Gent paid us a visit.  He came around &amp; had a yarn with each of us, &amp; gave us 6 penny stamps &amp; a writing Pad each.  Then a number of Ladies came along &amp; took down our names &amp; Home addresses.  Another old gent brought some more stamps, &amp; also gave us matches.  Then the Matron brought us 2 packets of Cigarettes.  About mid-day they dressed my wound.  It is coming along very nicely.  At 12.30 they brought Dinner.  Roast Beef &amp; Potatoes &amp; Baked Apples &amp; Rice.  Very nice indeed.  After Dinner an old lady brought us some very nice Home made scones. 
 After Tea they sang Hymns in the next Ward.  Matron played the Piano.  She invited us all to join in the singing.  I refrained, though the temptation was great.  At 7 they brought us Hot milk.  At 9.30 they put out the Lights &amp; I went to sleep, after a very pleasant day. 
 Mon. 8.  Since being in Hospital I have written to Stan Wright, Ruth B, Mrs Ibbs, Mrs Pudney &amp; Sister Sharp, so ought to get some replies during the next few days.  The Matron is a dear old Lady.  She comes round every day &amp; has a little talk with each of us.  When the Nurse took the Bandage from my Leg this morning, she said "Isn't that Beautiful?"  It was the wound she meant, not my leg.  That is far too skinny to be admired.  It is jolly cold although the sun does shine at intervals.   Wrote Letter 36 to B.E.
