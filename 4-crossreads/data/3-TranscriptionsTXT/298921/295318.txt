1915 Saturday December 25peace on earth - Goodwill towards men!!! What a farceI have not said much about the Navy but it was under their guns we left Anzac they acted as our Sponsors [indecipherable]Those of us who have lived in our clothes in the past 2 months are pretty ragged, compared to the Units who have no been further than Lemnos & are rather looked down on by the Brilliantined superiors. Had reinforcements come early & the British Nation listened to old Lord Roberts warning, we would have had men for Serbia & the Dardenelles. We intended having a Concert last night but the Skipper would not allow light - as we are in the danger zone of Subs.
