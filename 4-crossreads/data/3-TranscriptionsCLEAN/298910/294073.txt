All the Ambulance bearers are working together - 8th do 8 hours - the 14th do 8 hours & the 15th do 8 hours, as we have to carry patients back some 5 miles we work relay posts of 8 or 12 at posts - it is very heavy work bearing here - it is impossible to get along at all in the trenches - so we carry on top 4 or 6 men to a stretcher - you slip this way - then that & by trying to dodge one shell hole you fall into another. - It is quite true to say over nearly every yard of ground there is a shell hole, some of which you could bury a horse & cart. It is enough to turn one up the nights - the unburied germans the partly buried ones - which are easy enough to see by some portion sticking out - the stench also is cruel, on this account we very seldom used a Fritz dug out as some of them are full of dead & the entrance thrown down. The Germans were in this spot exactly three weeks ago - Any amount of Souvenirs to be had, but unless small & light the weight kills a man on the forced marches we had had lately & we have no chance of getting them away. About 1/2 mile away is a wrecked tank & coming
