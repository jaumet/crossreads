a touch of the blues the last day or two & been feeling very sleepy & in no humor for work; measles are quite the rage at present & there is quite a number of lads in hospital with them.  The food had not been kept up to us too well during the last week & I have to buy a good deal of jam at 4 PT (10d) per tin.  These Egyptians rob us hand over fist.  The pump in working order again & were able to water the horses at the trough again to night
Wed 27  Received some letters & papers from home late last night.  one each from Geo. Meg, Jess
