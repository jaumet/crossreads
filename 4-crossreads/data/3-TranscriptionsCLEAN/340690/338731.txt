for 3rd Brigade swimming sports to-morrow.  Worked late and rested in evening & bed after game of bridge.

Went down for swim & rested till time to move up line about 5.  Another stunting trip and right already advanced.  25 reinforcements and 7 to our section.  Moved off with everything and marched through Hamel towards Warfusee-Abancourt and then cross country.

Had a drink of tea and settled down in makeshift dugout for night with Sarre.
