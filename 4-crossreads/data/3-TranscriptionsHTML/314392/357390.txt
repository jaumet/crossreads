<p>It rained the greatest part of the night and when the rain wasn't falling the Fritz was over in their planes dropping bombs. In all I spent a hell of a night and the next morning I went across to see how the dug out got on and there were three of the boys nicely settled down near a fire they had made in it and quite at home. I guess I'll chance the next dugout.<br/>18th Hop over to Vendelles. Many prisoners and guns taken. Fritz pays us many nightly visits in his planes and drops many bombs. I'll be glad when we pull out of this</p>
