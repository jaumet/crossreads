  
 January, 1915 Sunday 31 Today I posted at Port Said my Diary - & will hold on now until I hear from you as to whether you receive it before sending more as all letters are still under Censor. In company with 3 other officers we did the slums of Port Said the seamy side of life, the dregs of the world & the dirtiest city:- Pigs, Goats, Dogs, Fowls run freely about the street & I did not see a single Motor. We move into the Mediteranean today & disembark tomorrow morning at Alexandria, but got little news of the world; or the war, Torpedoes guard entrance of Canal & Hydroplanes & Aeroplanes fly overhead.
