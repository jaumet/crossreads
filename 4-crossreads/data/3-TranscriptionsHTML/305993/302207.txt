<p>July 11<br/>Shifted from Victoria Docks to Gravesend &amp; there embarked all the soldiers &amp; there wives &amp; baggage.</p>
<p>July 12<br/>9 p.m.  Departed from Gravesend for Australia &amp; called at Portland on the 13th &amp; put out Channel pilot ashore.</p>
<p>13.7.19<br/>At 3 p.m. left Portland for Australia via St. Vincent, Cape Verde Islands for bunker coal &amp; then <strike>Cape Town</strike> Port Natal &amp; Fremantle.</p>
<p>14.7.19<br/>Fine weather prevailed &amp; everyone seem to be happy &amp; contented yet a few homesick after leaving their near relatives for a distant country.  1 a.m. we passed Ushant Lt. off the French coast.</p>
<p>15.7.19<br/>At 1 a.m. we passed C. Finisterre, Spain, fine weather prevailed throughout &amp; very few suffering from sea sickness.  Concert held in the 2nd Saloon this night which was packed &amp; proved a great success.</p>
<p>17.7.19<br/>At 7 a.m. we passed within 5 miles of the Islands of Maderia &amp; at 11 p.m. passed the Canary Islands.  Cricket &amp; deck billiards was the sports this day.  This day our Captain &amp; the Commanding Officer of the troops lectured all the Troops.  All paraded away from the wives re their conduct &amp; advised them not to be too familiar &amp; so conspicuous &amp; loving whilst on deck.  This is no doubt a great failing amongst all young married couples.  But with a crowd of 550 viz. 1100 men &amp; women all together in a small space, even a small percentage is very noticeable (besides single troops 200, hospital staff of certified nurses &amp; orderlies &amp; about 60 children under 4 years of age).</p>
<p>18.7.19<br/>Everything improved a lot after the advice given yesterday.  Instead of lounging on deck the majority today</p>
