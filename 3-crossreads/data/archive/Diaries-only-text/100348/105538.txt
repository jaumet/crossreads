1st March 1916.
Working with the bombing class today. We are nicknamed the "Suicide Club"; and it strikes me that a man will need plenty of sand to see this business through. Scottie came over from the Oasis where he is situated with the 1st A.L.H. We went to a concert, by the local talent.
4/3/16
Got a first class pass from the Bombing school, and a day off to go to Cario. Got an identification slip from Base Headquarters and went and drew 
7 from the bank. Visited the museum, and viewed many interesting relics. I saw a set of "diavals" that had been taken from some ancients tomb. I always thought it was a new game. Spent the rest of the evening in town, and did myself grand.
