<p>CIVILIANS KILLED<br/>Sunday 24th  [June]<br/>Early this morning the Hun commenced to sling big stuff over close to our Hospital and hit a barn in which a number of Belgian Civilians were holding a Church meeting.  <strike>Seven were killed and</strike>  We immediately dispatched Capt Bertram &amp; a car and it was found 7 had been killed and about 10 wounded mostly women.  Two more dead later.  It was an awful scene.<br/>Slept fairly well.  At about 10.30 just about dusk a large shell came whizzing over immediately followed by three blasts of whistle from somewhere close by.  By this time aircraft could be heard distantly and as three blasts are warning against enemy aircraft it was easily seen that some were about.  Their object was soon known for soon after quite a number of bombs were dropped in the vicinity followed in half an hour by another lot.  Three fires resulted but not much damage and only about 6 cases came thro us.</p>
<p>Monday 25th<br/>Slept soundly.  At night raining heavily &amp; the expected repetition of bombing did not eventuate.</p>
<p>Tuesday 26th<br/>Clear day &amp; rather cool.  In afternoon Perry &amp; I went to walk to Bailleul  where the Duke of Connaught had just completed reviewing the 2nd Anzac Army.  In the Square in the town I saw the collection of guns captured.</p>
