<p>Dear Mum,<br/>This is the outside of the French Catholic Church nears Marys Well. It is lovely inside   &amp;  it is the first Tike's Church I have ever been in. We took a couple of Photos but they will be no good. It was raining   &amp;  pretty dark. We had a terrible down pour the other night   &amp;  the water is still lying in the streets. I saw an Arab kid having a swim in the Main Street or rather main gutter.  Harry</p>
