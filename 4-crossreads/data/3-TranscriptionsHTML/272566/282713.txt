<p>Monday 26 November</p>
<p>Fine again.<br/>We had a look through the Gallery of War Pictures in The Jardin des Tuileries &ndash; well worth seeing.  Visited The Invalides where we saw German implements of war <strike>e</strike> captured at the Marne &amp; Somme.  Zeppelin L49 which was brought down recently &ndash; German Fokker &amp; other types of aeroplanes.  Guynemer's Plane is also on show.  He was killed recently &ndash; France's greatest airman.  The plane is decorated with flowers.  Saw Hotel de Ville &ndash; the leading Banks &ndash; The Matin Printing Office &ndash; Madeleine (Church) &ndash; Notre Dame (Church), Arc de Triomphe (2), many different Theatre Buildings &amp; practically all the monuments.  The Tube railways are good &amp; run on a splendid system.  Busses &amp; Trams likewise, but the Taxis are not up to London standard.<br/>Saw Napoleon's Tomb at The Invalides</p>
