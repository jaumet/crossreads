<p>"In a Tent"<br/>Old Lawson has sung of the stringy-bark tree<br/>(And the old stringy-bark aint no stranger to me<br/>He has praised the rough roof that has sheltered his rest<br/>And although Im no Lawson, Im doing my best,<br/>To give thanks to the tent that has given a roof<br/>To shelter my bunk when from padding the hoof<br/>Through the dust of the desert Ive often been tired<br/>And to dream in the blankets was all I desired.</p>
<p>There are songs that are sung of the stitching of shirts<br/>And fellows who wrangle over various skirts<br/>Even Homer has told of heros who fought<br/>For a tart known as Helen &ndash; ( I don't think they ought.-<br/>My theme is more humble, praps more to the point<br/>The metres erratic and oft out of joint<br/>In stating here that, to a certain extent<br/>Theres considerable merit attached to a tent.</p>
<p>On the edge of the plain where the desert sands glare<br/>Our tents are afly in the sand smothered air<br/>The distant mirage spreads its shimmering gleams<br/>That we never can reach like a river of dreams<br/>And the arch of the sky where the desert hawks wheel<br/>Its as hard &amp; as blue as the polish of steel &ndash;<br/>But in spite of the sand &amp; the desert immense<br/>We made it a home when we put up our tent</p>
