<p>Perham is a daisy when the wind sweeps over&hellip;it's like no other wind on earth in piercing quality &amp; cold as Death's own fingers. Since the big frost began we have had three weeks of steady freeze. The temperature not once rising above 27 &deg; F, but often lower. Heavy snow fell from the 4th to the 6th &amp; now lies on the ground (&amp; the roofs) frozen in solid masses. Even the water supply froze up &amp; for some days we've had to go without a wash until the pipes could be operated on. Naturally this un-usual cold has made itself felt in the shape of a variety of afflictions, the most popular being bronchitis of which I had a slight touch &ndash; nothing to matter. Sergeant "Sugar", one of our section sergts, cured me with rum. As a matter of fact it is commonly said that here &amp; in France Rum is the  only friend the sick soldier has in the cold months.</p>
