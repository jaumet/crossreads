Transport "Turakina" hoisted her ensign half-mast, and signalled a death aboard from heart disease. Tuesday, 29th May.

At 7.45 all ships of the Convoy hoisted their ensigns halfmast, and the "Turakina" stopped. At 8.15 she hoisted the flag to the top (denoting the end of the burial service) and the convoy hoisted theirs also. By this time we were almost abreast of her, so she steamed over to her station in the line. When she had arrived in her place all the ensigns were lowered.

Heavy swell during morning. Vessels of the Convoy
