26 July 1918 Friday   (Whole page crossed out)Dear old Day I know she is busyier than ever now so I must try & write a little plainer-  I have bought to sell to the men 7 hundred weight of grapes & 3 Casks of WINE-  better to be supplied with good stuff at a decent price than be robbed & get into trouble.I wonder what you have done re the old home-   Who will clean the Spouts & mend the fence!  etc etc:-   I only hope Joe turns up in 6 months time again-Love to you all.Censored
