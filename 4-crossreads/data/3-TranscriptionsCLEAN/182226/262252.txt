Sailing through the Grecian Archipelego. The scenery was grand. The sunset today was a glorious sight. We are zigzaging all the way to safe guard us against submarines.
It is funny to see how the people on the islands build their houses right on the highest points of the hills. It must be a terrible walk to get up to them.
