I took over the Post man's job, as our worthy Postman had gone on leave.   A comfortable job. I have an office to myself. More great victories came to hand during the week, &amp; naturally the troops are in a good humour.<br/>A Euchre Party, Whist Drive, Two Lectures &amp; a Dance, are held during the week, so you can see that we are having a good time here. Unfortunately the weather has been rotten lately, the Winter has started in earnest continuous rain for four days.</p>
