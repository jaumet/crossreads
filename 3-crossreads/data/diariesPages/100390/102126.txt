My Dearest People at Home
I got three parcels a few days ago. I did not recognise the writing on one I think the wrapper had come off and the P.O written another but the other have come. Yours I got. 4 pairs black sox. 1 collapsible cup. 1 tin coffee Russian; 2 plugs tobacco Havelock. 1 pkt adhesive plaster 1 Balaclava (red) 
1 Box lolly animals (God I did laugh when I opened ?em reminded me of ?hundreds of years ago?. I gave one to my pet. Officer.) I look flush. Thanks very much for your kind thought. All those things are good useful to me. I hope you get a few little things I sent home. Viva advises me as to some parcel but you know all the mail is not here yet. You may soon only get Post Cards from me. You know why, but 'read ?em as letters?. Its quite cold now I'm fairly well. I send enclosed a few photos of where we were on the Beach. The boxes are the depot 'tucker, ?etc? ? the photo big one shows just how they peppered us ?all the time?. There is nothing else but to wish you all the best of good things and thank you again and send you all my love
Yours affectionately 
Jack
