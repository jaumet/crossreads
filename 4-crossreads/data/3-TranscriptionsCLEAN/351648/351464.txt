better, I'll remind you later.
I'm trying to get away to the war & hope to do so before very long, I'm only waiting to pay my debts & then off like a shot, its rotten feeling that I'm almost the only one nearly of my contemporaries who is not doing his bit over there.  I saw Miss Garland at Dubbo but there didn't seem to be very much doing.
Being feminine you always raise ones curiosity in that artistic way so characteristic of women, 1st by subtle flattery & then by a studied reticence, for is it not flattery indeed to have it inferred that one is the a subject of sufficient interest to be talked about.  But why the deuce don't you tell me what some of the things you say you hear of me?  That would be far more to the point, is it charity? or fiction that is at the bottom of it ah?  Surely you must defend yourself now.
But surely this is long enough to merit a reply.  I shall await it.
My love to John & the nipper with very best wishes to yourself.
Yours very sincerelyJ. Bruiser Metcalfe
