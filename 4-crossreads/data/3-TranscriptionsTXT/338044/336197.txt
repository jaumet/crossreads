20th July:- ThursdayReached Havre main station at 6.15 am & immediately disentrained  Being encumbered with all our equipment & white kit bags, tired, dirty    & hungry & cold (for it was very cold last night) we did not feel inclined for marching. It transpired that we had gone more than a mile over our destination & nothing was left but a long route march back to the camp & we started off without any breakfast or wash on a roundabout way of about two miles. The kit-bags soon became very heavy & we all felt knocked-up, but hung on. It had rained during the night & the roads were sloppy, the brisk marching kept us warm. Reached the details camp at 8-45 am & were immediately allotted tents. We all rushed the canteen on dismissal for a good breakfast, too hungry to wait
