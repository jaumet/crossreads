previously occupied this region knew of this and kept up a certain
fire of shrapnel by day and night over the gully and more particularly
over the road.  During the night we took over the section of the
front line held by one of our First Division battalions, the operation
taking all night to perform owing to congestion in the saps   caused
through dead and wounded lying about, and carrying parties moving
along with stores and ammunition.  In the morning after repelling two
half hearted German counter attacks we set to work to clean up the
trenches, a by no means small job.  Bodies, equipment, rifles,

impossible to realise that only a short time ago this had been a
peaceful cultivated field.  It is hard to know ones position in a
land like this and anywhere it is difficult not to lose oneself.  The
shell holes and wobbling trenches are as confusing as a maze and the
whereabouts of the enemy is not always easy to make out.  Sometimes
he will be in a trench at right angles to your own, sometimes he may
be slightly in rear of your own trench an frequently he occupies the

It was in the latter position that we found ourselves and it

to get the Boche out.  There is perhaps no more horrible form of
fighting than bombing, unless it be gas.  The range is so close and
