<p>this shower cooled me down gradually &amp; then we went out &amp; had a plunge in the cold water bath, by this time we were as white as snow &amp; feeling fit for anything from here we went into the hot room again &amp; had a good rub down with a rough towel &amp; then upstairs &amp; onto a couch &amp; covered up here we had to stop until we regained our normal temperatures, when we got dressed, just before we went into the bath I weighed myself stripped &amp; just tipped the scales at 9 st 10 &frac34; lbs after coming out I weighed again &amp; I was exactly 1 &frac34; lbs lighter that gives you an idea how it pulls one down, we were an hour &amp; a half going through all these processe's, &amp; when it was all over I never felt better in my life, we then walked back to our hotel settled our accounts &amp; made over to the station for our train, we had a fine journey back</p>
