  
 In the afternoon Blue Dimock & I went down the town & saw a game of Soccer between 2 Navy teams, it was the fun of the world & rough as you could wish for.  Blue & I won a cigar each from 2 other Sgts.  After the match we went into Plymouth & had dinner at "Genom's" & after this we went to the Repertory & saw "Monbys Flapper", it was a regular scream & pretty hot at times, we both thoroughly enjoyed the farce.  After the theatre came out we went to Millbay Station & caught the 10.30 tram for St. Budeaux eventually arriving home about 11.20. 
 24th.  Nothing much doing today as it is Sunday & raining at that. It is rumoured this morning that the D.29 has been cancelled won't the the boys be roaring if it is true for they were kidding themselves that they were getting away in front of us.
