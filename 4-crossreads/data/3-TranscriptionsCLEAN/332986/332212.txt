  
 Showery and misty all day. 5 of our guns out of action. One of our Bdr got a nasty knock. A gas shell hit one of our guns. This Bdr and a gunner were striping the gun, taking breech block, dial sights & etc away. He got the full force of this mustard gas all over him, A lot in his eyes, Almost blinding him. The gunner got a fair share also. Sgt Gibson to go to D.A.C., can't stand the noise of the guns. Waiting for the weather to fine up 
 3-8-1917 Still wet and miserable. Capt Glendinning and Lieut Ford killed last night. The Capt was transferred to 6th Bty two days ago, he was in 3rd Bty. Ford was at one time Sgt. Up to date the 3rd Bty has lost 18 horses killed. Three more wounded last night. All Sgts and gunners, with the exception of a guard, down at wagon line. Done up properly.
