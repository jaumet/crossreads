I <strike>way</strike> was lying up on Friday for &frac12; a day with it, &amp; kept on hot poultices which took down the inflammation a good deal.  There is really nothing to worry about now, Father dear, for I am taking every possible care of it.<br/>I see by to-night's casualty list one of Rev. B.J. Meek's sons (Private R.S.) has been killed.<br/>I have been trying to get into communication with Horace Walker who was Glen Innes Exp. Farm as Experimentalist &amp; as a last resource I wrote to the Manager a week ago asking him for Horace's address.  He replied that it was Sargeant Horace Walker, etc. etc. etc. Liverpool Camp; so that he has enlisted for active service.  Any chance of my going, Dad?<br/>It still keeps dry up here; we are still sowing, &amp; have about another fortnight's work to finish.  I will be jolly glad when we have done, as it is a very busy time for us now.<br/>Must close now, with love to all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.<br/>P.S. Many thanks for your explanation of different words.  It is very good of you to trouble about them for me.</p>
