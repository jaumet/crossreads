The scene of the warf is a sight worth beholding. The large quantities of necessaries for the troops. Warm clothes for the winter & many months supply of rations stacked everywhere. The organization for the welfare of the men is excellent & the A. S. C. C. is one of the most useful in this war. Every preparation is being made for a long winter at the front, & large steamers are continually carrying tons of food etc from here to the Dardinelles.
