<p>bombs into our trenches.  Some snipers got fairly close.  We put in a heavy fire &amp; it quietened them down.  Poor old Segt Parkes was killed, a better chap never walked.  We were all very much affected about it.</p>
<p>Tuesday 25th [May]<br/>We were on fatigue nearly all the morning.  I was very tired after the previous nights duty &amp; just got settled down into a comfortable sleep when we had to shift again to relieve B Company.  At 6 oclock we moved into the supports.  The "Triumph" was torpedoed in full view of our position today.  She took 35 minutes to sink but most of the crew were drowned.  She had done some fine work here.  We had a crowded night in the supports &amp; were not too comfortable.  There was a fair bit of rain during the day.</p>
<p>[Most of the "Triumph" crew were saved]</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th<br/>We went into the trenches</p>
