<p>19th Aug<br/>Near Gibraltar<br/>A 67</p>
<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>There is just a chance that letters posted at Gibraltar may arrive before these posted in England, so I will drop a line. We expect to hit the rock tomorrow morning early. There will of course, be no leave. Yesterday at dusk, we were pulled up by a French dreadnought. She came very close to examine us &amp; they gave us three cheers.</p>
