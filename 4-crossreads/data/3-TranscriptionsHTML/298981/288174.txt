<p>The Mule Transport</p>
<p>Most of the mule transport was carried out after dark as our positions were too exposed to the Turkish observation posts.</p>
<p>The mules were very enduring and sure of foot.  They easily climbed mountains of six hundred feet high, and brought to us our daily rations of food and water.</p>
<p>The Indian drivers who were knick named "Johnny" were very cheery and obliging.  They enjoyed a good joke and always spoke well of the fighting qualities of the Australians.  They were most loyal subjects both to England and their religion.  They were very modest, and very proud of their dugouts which they made into quite respectable homes, but they were particularly reserved in inviting strangers inside.  We were only allowed to enter on very few occasions.</p>
<p>Right from the beach to the hillsides,<br/>Over rocks, and through mud and scrub,<br/>We saw the Indian mule guides<br/>Drive the mules with our daily grub.<br/>From sunset to sunrise untiring<br/>They <strike> worked and without them we knew</strike> helped us in the great fight<br/><strike>That it would be extremely unwise</strike>  heedless of firing, they brought us<br/><strike>To expect meat for our daily stew.</strike><br/>our rations up during the night.</p>
