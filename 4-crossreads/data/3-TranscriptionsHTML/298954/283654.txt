<p>Sun 26th May (cont.)<br/>The long cobbled Plauerstrasse which leads to the town from the lager is bordered with barracks on the outskirts of the town.</p>
<p>The old gate towers of the walls of medieval Brandenburg still remain standing;   the modern town is congested, narrow, &amp; provincial.   One little detail pleased both of us &ndash; encircling the light standards some 12 feet from the ground are baskets of petunias and geraniuns, now in full bloom.</p>
<p>At a service (non-demoninational) in the evening, conducted by Harrison.   Ted (H.Y. Rodell, "Colchester") is organist.   The Catholic and Russian altars, the Jewish synagogue, a boot repairing shop, &amp; the camp theatre are all housed in portions of one long barrack.   The two altars are side by side;   when one is in use a curtain is drawn across the other.</p>
