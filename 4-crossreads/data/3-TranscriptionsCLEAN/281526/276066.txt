14/1/18 LondonA foggy morning. There had been a deal of snow and rooves and chimney pots were all white with it. Breakfasted in room and then bussed up to Ludgate Hill. Went to the Central Criminal Court No. 1 mainly to see Darling J. Very few other of the public here. And now comes the arm of coincidence. The case being tried was that of Jones (a civilian) and Sharpe & Maguire, two Australian soldiers who were charged with the wilful murder of one Imlay a soldier of the Canadian Forces. The man Maguire is a member of my own 22nd. Battalion!. To think of his Colonel in sightseeing chancing upon him in an obscure court standing his trial for his life. More than that the official witness was Clive Williams of the Staff, old Charlie's brother. There was not much scope for the wit of Darling J.
