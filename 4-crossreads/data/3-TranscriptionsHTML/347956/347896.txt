<p>Tue 23rd<br/>With A Sq again to-day &amp; went out on the desert &amp; the troops were trench digging  this afternoon  We had a lot of signalling to do to-day &amp; everything went along swimmingly;  We were near no water &amp; the horses had neither food nor water for dinner &amp; did not arrive back in camp until after sundown;  went nowhere after tea; which was a good one &amp; some underclothing was issued to the troops to-night;  I bayonetted a snake this morning going out; (first blood)</p>
