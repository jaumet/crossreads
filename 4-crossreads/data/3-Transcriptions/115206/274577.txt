<p>January 1918<br/>Monday 7</p>
<p>At Beutin<br/>Received more mail from Australia via "Savernake". These letters were long cheerily written epistles, "Savernake" also writes some very long letters. Answered all my mail during the afternoon. Mac returned from Bolougne. Weather very cold, with bleak winds.<br/>Went with James to Divere Cinema at Attin, 2 kilos away, very good show. Met Dick and Wattie there.</p>
