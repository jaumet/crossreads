chap - is a brother of "Doss", the N.S.W. rep footballer, & told me the latter nearly went under recently with severe wounds, & has had his left leg amputated. I thought our easy time was too good to last, & tomorrow we are to move off to fresh adventures. Went across to Boo's "pozzy" after tea, they had a close go this afternoon, Fritz lobbed a couple of shells near where he was washing & two chaps shaving, & they dived below to their dugout under the old barn, just as another shell hit the barn & smashed a rifle where a chap was shaving before. My word the world is small - in our dugout tonight, two chaps were yarning round the little fire & I heard one mention Warialda. I spoke up & said I used to live there, & he told me his father had a blacksmith's shop there, & he said he went to school under Percy Hall & Miss Brown. Great Scot, eh, to think that in a dugout on the Arras front in France, I should strike a fellow who was in the same school in my old home town in the country in N.S.W. My section of 4 were on gas guard tonight, looking out for gas from the Huns or the S.O.S. signal while the rest slumbered. I didn't have to stay up, each woke the other at the end of his 2 hours. Rum issue tonight, it's very warming.
