<p>[Thursday 3 February 1916]</p>
<p>Had a Field Day &amp; like last summer a good deal of pretence at fighting. One bridge over a Canal was supposed to be blown up &amp; the Tommie Sentry blocked a L.H. Trooper Scout from going across it.<br/>So he tied his clothes on the Saddle took off his boots &amp; with the reins in his teeth swinging his arms as [indecipherable] swimming &amp; yelling out, <u>walked</u> over, saying &ndash;"the bridge is blown up" &amp; I'm swimming alright."<br/>All this is to keep men &amp; Horses fit while we wait for the attacks that never come.  Men soon get stale &amp; we I want a football badly- but by the time it could arrive, we will be fighting again in Ernest.</p>
