Bouzincourt 2/6/17
Morning parade as usual. Marching order so that packs can be checked. Caned Lawlor up with some acidulated remarks. Lewis gunners practising firing on the move. After lunch rode down to Warloy with Stewart and went to Bde.H.Q. Saw Macgregor and heard a bit about the Stokes motor accident yesterday. 5 dead so far ? 16 others wounded premature. Some rain as we rode home. The country the other side of Warloy is wonderfully pretty. After mess Stewart Bunning came along from "A" Coy's dinner which was a great success and run entirely by the privates and junior N.C.O.s. Much food and liquid as is usual. On Stewarts place was a card with "Paddy" on it and on Bunnings one with "Bill" on it. A great night with the boys cost them 5 francs a head! Our chaps draw too much pay, 1 shilling per day should be the maximum. They waste all their draw in a couple of gaudy days after each pay day comes round.
