Ypres
24/9/16  Entering the historic city of Ypres was one felt another of the many strange experiences passed through since leaving Australia.  One cannot but feel affected passing for the first time through a place where so many brave men have fought and died. The convent shell-riddled, is the first large building passed and after that one rides through a large city full of debris and wreckage, a place where not one house remainswhich is not damaged and devastated.  Walls full of gaping holes; glassless windows and tottering ruins met the eye everywhere.  A sense of desolation that is a very monument to the awfulness of modern warfare.  The old cloth hall is wrecked and the winding streets lead round it to the market square which is a wilderness. Fine buildings lie in ruins all round, civil life is entirely absent and the city is a place of silence and darkness the only light being that from a candle or two in dugouts and the only sound the rumble of transport wagons and the footsteps of stray soldiers wandering along in the gloom.  A more utterly destroyed place it is impossible to imagine.  It can never be rebuilt after the war its commerce will probably pass to some neighbouring town that has escaped comparatively unscathed.  Leaving the town we pass the gaol and then reach open country once more. The town is walled but we could not see them owing to the darkness.  Fatigues of trudging men carried engineers stores and the reflection of flares and the rattle of gunshots let us know of the close proximity of the firing line.  Found  Battn. HQ in an old cellar under a ruined building and saw the CO & others.  A small stunt was on. 8 of our chaps were lying out in No Mans Land waiting to kill a German patrol which every night by the same route.  We waited quietly at HQ for news of the success of the plans, so calmly do we deliberately in war plot the death of our fellow beings!  Suffering tonight from a heavy cold, streaming eyes and all the other inviting accompaniments.  Intercepted some letters for me at the Post Office.
