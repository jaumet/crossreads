 Monday 8th October 1917 Nr Reninghelst Left lines with team about 7.30am going up the line to try and get our waggon out. Got to within a mile of the wagon when our Donks got bogged. Great job in getting them out, could not get along the track with the Donks so useless to try and bring a wagon so we were told to return to the lines. Arr back in lines a 2.30pm. Started raining very heavy about 5pm.
