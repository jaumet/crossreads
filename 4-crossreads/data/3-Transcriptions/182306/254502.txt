<p>we were all dead tired so got between the blankets but were all roused out again early &amp; packed up to move off by 1 pm the same day. And came to Bussy - Le - deoure. We only stayed there a couple of hours &amp; moved on to Blangy.&nbsp; Fronville in the pouring rain. When we arived there we had to line a ridge about half a mile behind the Front line for they were expecting Fritz to attack that night</p>
