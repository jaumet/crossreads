flash of guns, ours here now there.  Shrapnel bursting high in the air away towards the line.
Saturday 26 May
Very inspiring time during that 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift on guard.  Clear moon, just surmounting a bank of clouds grey with white [indecipherable] ridge.
These clouds were the beginning of a great change in the weather. Early evening was just warm & in keeping with the perfect weather of late. As I went off at 2 a.m.
