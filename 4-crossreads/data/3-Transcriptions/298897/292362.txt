<p>thrown out through a hessian wall landing on my back in a trench outside.  We must be fairly hard as we get some awful bumps without any ill affects.</p>
<p>Tuesday 5th<br/>A dull cold &amp; wet day so much so that I was glad to do some digging.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6th<br/>O.S. for the day.  General fatigues all day preparing for the rainy weather.  Heavy bombardment at night mostly with trench mortars.  Taubes over twice during the day fragments of the shells fired at them falling all round us.  They kept up at a great height.</p>
<p>Thursday 7th<br/>Had a free afternoon so rode into "Estairs" &amp; had a very good time.  The ride itself was first rate the horses being very fresh.  Arriving there we stabled our horses &amp; visited our various friends having tea in the town.  After that we celebrated the outing with champagnes being joined by one of our officers for part of the time.  Arrived home abut 8.30 feeling extremely merry &amp; bright with things in general.  My companion earned a bad name for us</p>
