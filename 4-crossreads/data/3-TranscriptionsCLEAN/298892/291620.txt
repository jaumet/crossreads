  
 It appears that one man out of each A.M.C. Detail in the division has to attend the course. It is to comprise a series of twenty lectures and an examination at the conclusion. If we pass the examination we receive a Chiropodist's Certificate. Each of us are to be provided with a complete set of instruments and will be expected to convey our knowledge to the rest of the Detail when we are qualified ourselves. We were all issued with our colours to-day - black and green - oval in shape. There seems to be some doubt as to whether we will wear these or chocolate the A.M.C. colour. A box of comforts from the A.A.M.C. Comforts Depot Sydney arrived a few days ago. We each received a nice green sweater, 2 pr socks, 2 towels, 2 handkerchiefs, 1 pr. mits, 1 large flannell cap & comforter, - very welcome gifts in this weather; Also a number of "Bulletins". I posted home from London a book of views which I hoped might interest you, a few pictures, and a Xmas & Birthday present for Kit - a Butterfly. It's rather suitable don't you think! We haven't heard anything definite about leaving for the front. Probably we will be here for Xmas now. Our camp is a regular quagmire at present. The winter rains have set in and if one puts foot off the beaten track he sinks in mud up to the ankle or slips over on the glassy surface. One consolation
