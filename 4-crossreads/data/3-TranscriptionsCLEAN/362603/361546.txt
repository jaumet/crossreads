We have only had 2    cool    nights to-date. I met Wal. Patterson from Brookvale again to-night.  He was over from Park House on Duty.  I have dozens of letters to write & I am trying to do a little reading also.  I had to darn 7 pairs of socks this afternoon, only tiny Holes, but they all take time.  I am going to get another  10 off the Firm so You can pay it over as soon as You like.  It costs about  3.10.0 for a weeks leave & I have had about 21 days leave in 3 months (better keep it dark) & it takes money.  I am sure to want some money for X'mas too.  Now, Dad, I told Mum all about My Manx Trip, so I'll not repeat it here.  Ellis & Dave & I are all Tip-top.  We are quite naturalised now as well as climatized so we "carry on." Remember me to Otto & all the neighbours & to Mr & Mrs Ali & Stephen. Best Love to You & Kindest regards to all Sincere Friends, From Your own Son Harry
