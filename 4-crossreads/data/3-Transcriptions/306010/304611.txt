<p>L'Estagne &ndash; 43 minutes in the tram from Marseille on the seafront (opposite side of the harbour to which we are). Passed British, Indian &amp; Russian camps on the way. There are quite a number of pretty tram trips round Marseille taking from &frac12; to 1 hour.<br/>Have again received orders to pack up our stores and this time it looks as if things are in earnest. A start will be made to-morrow with reveille at 5.30 a.m. daily.<br/>A course of instruction in Army medical work had just been started by acting O.C. (Lieut. Col. Dick[?]) with 2 lectures a day, but on account of the extra work involved in packing equipment, it has had to be discontinued.<br/>50 more of the nurses leave tonight for the north, 10 each to St. Omer,</p>
