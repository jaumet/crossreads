the Germans broke through and we had to go back to a place called Hondeghem.  A fortnight in Hondeghem we had to make a very hurried retreat to a place called Blendecques.  Three months in Blendecques we went back to our old place at Hondeghem - From there we were shifting to St. Venant when we got the order that 1914 men are to go back to Australia on leave.  Left Hondeghem in Motor Transport and went to Bray-sur-le-Somme [Bray sur Somme].  Remained a fortnight in Bray-sur-la-Somme then travelled down through France and the north of Italy and the east coast of Italy - Crossed the Mediterreanean [Mediterranean] Sea on "Ormonde" down the canal to Kantara - Took train from Kantara to Port Suez - Five days Port Suez, then we embarked on the Port Sydney for Australia - We touched on our way Colombo - Fremantle - Melbourne - Sydney.
