<p>Sunday 8 December 1918<br/>Did not leave as advertised.  Loading all day.  Had our meals aboard.  Very cold &amp; wet. The hydrolic winches made Hell of a row.</p>

<p>Tuesday 10 December 1918<br/>From here until Thursday morning I lose all interest in the proceedings!!!  Am sick as old Harry.</p>
<p>Wednesday 11 December 1918<br/>Who called it "Pacific"!!!  Rup's all serene!</p>
<p>Thursday 12 December 1918<br/>Strolled round deck this morng. &ndash; feeling &amp; looking like nothing on earth.  Reckon "Niagara" is a rotten ship.  She rolls all over the place.</p>

<p>Saturday 14 December 1918<br/>Reach calmer water at last but the confounded ship still rolls.  Getting warmer.  Tried my hand at Deck Tennis.<br/>Who called it the "Pacific" Ocean.</p>
