  
 Visit the Cairo Zoo this afternoon, they have on the whole a better collection of animals than Sydney   &  the Place is much better laid out, not to mention that the whole Gardens is a mass of trees which is very pleasant for both Animals   &  Visitors Dad comes out in the evening for a chat   &  brings a few necessities he had in store for me 
 1915 September 29 Wednesday 
 Put in a quiet day at home   &  Have a sleep in the afternoon. After tea a notion strikes me to go for a car ride  &  catch the 7 pm tram to Cairo   &  return home at 10 pm
