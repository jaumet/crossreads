<p><u>At Sea</u><br/>23. 5. 15.  <br/>My dearest Moth.<br/>It is six weeks since I left Melb. and am still on the sea. Oh. how I should love to have a peep at you all now. Sorry I cannot write much but hope to be able to soon.<br/>It is fearfully hot and think  <strike>y</strike> there will be very little of me left if the heat continues. The sea is very calm just now. Last week I had a bad time for two days &ndash; (sea-sick again)  Feeling very well now. Dorothy is very well again, she was not ill this time. <br/>We had a concert last night  &amp; she sang but not nearly so well as she did last Sunday. We also have a man on board with a magnificent voice  &amp; he sang better than ever last night. He is a Welshman, his name is Jones. I wonder if he is any relation to John Jones? The programme was very good. We pass the time playing Bridge, deck Billiards etc. also   <u>Fortune Telling</u> - Mollie's friend from Geelong is the Fortune-teller. She is kept very busy reading hands &amp; cards. I had a long yarn to her yesterday. She has been well all the time.  <br/></p>
