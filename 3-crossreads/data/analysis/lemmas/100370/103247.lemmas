 As to this retreat across the Jordan , whether it is strateg and a trap for Johnni , or whether we had to leav , I of cours am unabl to say . It was piti to see the string of refuge from Es Salt . The N.Z 's and 2nd Brigad had occupi this place , and blown a bridg and some road near . The peopl there are all arm to the teeth , and rejoic exceed when our peopl appear . They fought with our fellow , against the Turk , and especi join with great eager ani snipe parti . When we evacu the place , they turn rather nasti , and thing look black for a while . Doubtless they felt , and just , that they had been suck in . They had taken our part against the Turk and now the Turk was come back . So there was noth left but to come with us . And so they came , women and children , age and sick , carri all they could of their poor household good , with the Turk follow close on them , these poor wretch fought their weari way to the safeti of the western bank of the Jordan . On the 3rd we went twice across the Jordan . About 11-30 AM. we move our camp to the other side , and by 7-30 PM. we were back again . A few shell came rather unpleas close , and so someon deem it advis for the Ambulanc to move back , so back we went . We are make excel progress . On the 2nd we left the eastern bank , and came to the western , on the 3rd in the morn we went back to the eastern , and at night we return to the western . These futil trip are mere some of the littl pleasantri that the Militari Author are overflow with , and , as they are absolut certain to have a most pulveris effect on enemi hope and plan , we endur them as silent as we may . But the worst was to follow . Our camp on the night of the 3rd was in a beauti , clean basin form by the fantast shape hill which are so common on this western bank . The cover from air raid was excel , but all the same next morn we had to move into the next Wadi . Whi did we move this time ? Becaus
