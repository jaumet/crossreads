<p>Friday 1 Sept. 1916<br/>About midnight had received word that I was to set out at 9 a.m. to the Army Gas School as Cassel. It was a dull morning but very little rain really fell. At the Field Ambulance a car was waiting to take us the 13 to 15 miles. 3 doctors went, our route taking us up Mont des Chats. We reached Cassel just before 10.30 &amp; at once were started off with a lecture which lasted till abt. 1 o'c when we had to find our billets, mine being in the little village of  Bavinchove, not much of a billet really. Got some lunch there &amp; then walked up to Cassel a large town built on a hill from which it is said one can see from Dunkirk to the Somme. Unfortunately it was dull the whole time we were there so that it was not possible to get a really good view. Lecture again in the afternoon &amp; then dinner at the main hotel. Long walk to billet.</p>
