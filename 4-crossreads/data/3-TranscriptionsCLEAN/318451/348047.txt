Communion to follow.This afternoon I made some inquiries about the mens Christmas dinner & I got extra vegetables for them & 70 cases of comforts will be opened.We were unfortunate today.  A few of our men had not come out of the trenches & a shell came over.  Sgnt. Hillier was killed, Major Sneddon badly wounded, 4 of the 41 killed & 1 of 43 & several wounded.  Two gun men were wounded also.  I was at the hospital at 9 oclock & saw Major Sneddon & several others.
Monday 25thToday is Christmas day - a queer Christmas.  The parcels were distributed & were a source of pleasure to the men & with the little extra they had a good dinner & seem to be quite happy & cheerful.  I was round the billets this afternoon.  For our dinner we had some cold mutton & bread & butter.  For dinner tonight we are opening our Christmas pudding.
