<p>Claudius. Look you here Mormy &ndash; dont go slinging boiling water around your house &amp; scalding thighs etc. Really you might have had a bad timer that time if you had'nt had thick cloths on. And you did'nt tell me, either It was Nance or Joan that "split" on you. I believe, if you had lost or scalded all your thighs, youo would'nt have told me. Well I'll knock off now darlings.</p>
<p>I'm so glad your getting that tin all right I was afraid there would be delay etc.</p>
<p>I feel proud to be able to supply a few necessary things, "duds" etc, to my mormy.</p>
<p>Cheer-oh sweethearts &amp; Best Love to yourself<br/>Your boy<br/>John</p>

<p>PS. My little mare is still going strong. Her name is "Ma Cherie" which is just the sort of name to suit her I'm getting a photo taken of her &amp; me by one of the fellows.</p>
