About 4 oclock this morning there was a great commotion up round the firing line,  the strength of it was this, early last night our chaps got word that there would very likely be a raid & so they got ready   true enough it came off & it was a dismal failure for the Huns    everything was ready for them artillery, machine guns & all & I believe the ground was littered with their bodies this morning, "revenge is sweet."When I lobbed in the Camp this morning, I was surprised at the number of entirely new faces & quite a number of details had arrived, including Depina, Baines & a few more.Capt Edgely has gone to A. Coy"
