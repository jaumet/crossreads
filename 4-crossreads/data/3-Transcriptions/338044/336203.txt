<p>up at Peel House, Overseas Club for soldiers, at night  &amp;  very tired, am soon asleep.</p>
<p>23th July:- <strike>Saturday</strike> Sunday<br/>Wake at 8 am &amp;  have breakfast. This is a fine club &amp; does great credit to the ladies who  so voluntarily assist in it's upkeep. The meals are good &amp; half the price of restaurants. A good warm bath to follow, then a shave &amp;  boots cleaned &amp; I feel A1, although troubled slightly with a cold. Walking along Victoria St, Westminster greatly to my surprise, I see, above all persons, Justin Cunningham from the Town Hall, Sydney &amp;  in uniform. Catch the next bus and chase him but after a few streets he descends &amp;  our pleasure at meeting is mutual &ndash; after 12 months. His brother is introduced &amp; we all three set forth to church, the R.C. Cathedral at Westminster just in time for 11 am Mass. A beautiful Cathedral, larger than St Mary's Sydney, but apart from it's historic attach<strike>ed</strike>ment, no finer</p>
