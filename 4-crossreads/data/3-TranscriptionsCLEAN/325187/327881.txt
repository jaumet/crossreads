[Thursday 18 May 1916]
Marched out at 3.30 AM a long dusty line of Camels & men.  Expect a scrap at any time   Passed some dead Turks it is hard to bury a man properly as they swell up & the sand is so loose they come to the surface not to mention the Jackals.  On outpost all night beautiful night, only thing that is beautiful is the stars   Country just like the Sand Hummocks at Warrnambool .Stand to arouses everyone at 3.45 AM till 5 AM
