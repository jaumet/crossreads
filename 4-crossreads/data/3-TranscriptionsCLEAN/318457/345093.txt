 silently amongst the islands and according to their detailed orders searched the bays for German warships. They returned after about an hour stating that nothing had been seen. 
 Considerable excitement was caused by the sight of fires upon the tops of hills, evidently signals indicating our approach. We know a wireless [message] from some signal station on New Britain was made relative to our attack. So that we must have been seen before we reached the harbour, though some officials on the shore said they did not see us until the moon had risen, about 10pm. 
 We waited in the bay until sunrise, continually circling round, the destroyers always on the move also. 
 During the morning, two visits were paid by the 1st Lieut. to the shore officials enquiring the whereabouts of the wireless station. One official said there was no wireless in his district. Another district officer said the same as to his district but admitted that there was a station about 5 to 10 miles inland connected by telephone  with the township. Bombardment was threatened but not carried out. All that was done was to land a party ashore to smash up their telephone instruments etc at Herbetshohe. Personal property was not touched.
