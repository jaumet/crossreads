<p>nice woman, who lives in Cairo. We had a ripping time. Our hostess is an Englishwoman but is very fond of we Australians, she had six officers there in the afternoon, so you can imagine the fun we all had, fellows full of fun but poor old chaps had to leave at 6. p.m. to go on duty, away with their men, somewhere. Then three more Australian soldiers not officers) &amp; one Englishman arrived. We simply had a great evening, one of the boys sang beautifully, another played the piano &amp; the three were real nice happy boys. The Englishman, said he has never enjoyed an evening, so much before &ndash; was quite in love with us all. Really the people we meet are so good to us all. I'm afraid we shall be spoilt. So delighted to hear that darling Eddy had such a beautiful birthday, it was very nice of Marian, Charlie &amp; Flo remembering the dear kiddy. So pleased to hear about poor old Flo hope she will get along alright.</p>
