<p>Fricourt &amp;Dernacourt 23/11/16  An orderly had my new horse outside.  A smart looking little black mare. With the Colonel rode along quite good roads to Dernacourt.  Stricken woods and shell scarred earth are being prepared for human use again by the kindly restorative acts of nature with her green-leaf clothes.  At the edge of Mametz Wood is a very large trim cemetery with neat rows of crosses and permanent caretakers.  A lovely sunny morning.  A Taube flying above was shot down by our guns.  Passed through Mealte where the Welsh and Grenadier Guards were in billets.  Every man was spick and span with dazzling buttons and neat fitting clothes.  Saluting was most punctilious and one's hand wearied performing them.  The German NCO's in charge of working parties also have to salute officers.  Some of these Huns are fine looking chaps.  The little tail pockets are a characteristic of their tunics.  Reaching Dernacourt we went to Bde HQ and had lunch with the General and after that went to 23rd.  Found Jack was at at a school some distance away.  Sent cable home saying we were quite well and fit.  The village of Dernacourt is about 5000 &amp; has an old church bearing date 1733 -  a white stone place.  Returning via the same road we made the pace and found the Guards had an excellent drum and fife band parading in the traffic.  More strenuous saluting!.  Some fine tall men in these regiments.  Road fairly free from transport.  Orderly carried 40000 francs drawn for pay tonight and Bde. Xmas Cards had also turned up.  In the evening wrote up the War Diary covering all our operations.  Our casualties 5 - 21st/11/16 and killed 48 wounded 153 sick.  Quite a comfortable mess here with the MGO Sig. officer &amp; Bomb officer in addition to our usual small family.  Bugles sound last post.</p>
