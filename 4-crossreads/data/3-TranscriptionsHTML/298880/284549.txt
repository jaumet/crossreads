<p>in Bing Boys. Yesterday I went to the Tower of London and saw many interesting old things. The execution block. The armoury. Wakefield Tower etc  It is splendid buildings. I have seen the Admiralty buildings Houses of Parliament Buckingham Palace. The Law Courts &amp; many other fine old buildings. I had a splendid time but it passed all too quickly. Am taking some <strike>ser</strike> paper serviettes back to the boys and a couple of mouth organs as a bit of music always cheers us up.</p>
