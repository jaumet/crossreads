  
 As for myself, I am very comfortable except when it rains (like it did last night) as it wets all my blankets. I have received a couple of letters from you since I landed also the Sunday Times, thank you very much for them. I also received a letter from Mr Vidler and a box of cigars, I wish you would thank him very much for me in case my letter to him goes astray. It was very thoughtful of him. How is Father's eye? I hope it is very much better by now. 
 There has been a bit of a scare the last few days. A German submarine has been nosing about and consequently the battleships have been kept on the move, and most of the transports sent to Lemnos. 
 I suppose Father is getting books and papers on the war, if so, he might try and get the "Daily Mail" dated 8th May, as it cracks the Australians up to the skies. I have not seen it but I believe it is very good. There is no doubt they have done wonderful work but at what cost! Their trenches are perfect now and we will not be driven out now. The only thing that troubles us are their guns which must be manned by Germans. One runs backwards and forwards on rails. It comes out of a tunnel, fires a few rounds, and runs back again. They have several of this kind and neither the warships or our batteries can get them. We also get shells from the forts in the Narrows which are about six miles away across the Peninsula. One is a huge thing, we think it must be off the "Goeben". [German battle cruiser SMS Goeben, transferred to the Turkish Ottoman Navy in 1914] It would weary you to give details of some of the Officers lost, but General Bridges had bad luck being shot by a sniper in the leg. He died on his way to Alexandria. I have to close now and can only say that the worst as far as we are concerned is now over, as we are becoming very cute when the shells are flying about. Very best love to Father, Dorothy, Alice and the rest of the family. We are not allowed to write letters, only Field Service postcards, so don't be surprised if you don't hear from me for some time. 
 With very best love, I remain, (Sgd.) N. Plomley. 
 P.S. I cabled you that I was well, did you receive it? 
 I have just witnessed an awful sight. I was addressing the envelope when someone yelled out "they have got the 'Triumph'"! I rushed out and saw her with a heavy list, about 2 or 3 miles off the land. I could see that she was doomed. A submarine had got her. Torpedo boats, pinnaces &c. rushed to her rescue. She has just turned turtle, 16 minutes after she was hit. Many brave men must have gone down with her. At the time of writing she is bottom up. She has not yet gone down. Clouds of smoke could be seen coming from Cape Helles. Destroyers to the rescue, but they are too late, except that they might be able to pick up some of the men in the water. The "Triumph" has done marvellous work here, and had just returned from Lemnos where she received stores etc. It was terrible to see such a fine ship going down.
