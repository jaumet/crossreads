already moved off they are going I believe to Newcastle to shift horses if so they will very probably join us at Fremantle however at present no one bar the heads knows anything.
I had a letter from Auntie, some while ago clean forgot to answer it now I do not know the address. Will you give her Uncle Willy my love when next you see them I will try write when afloat. if I'm not to sick miserable if you have not already sent P.C. you mentioned it would be better to send it to the Herald Office addressed to Stan. They are at present stopping at a boarding house at Turack but will be moving into a furnished cottage shortly. closer to the station. I would have liked to go out there again but theres no hope. now I think I'm just wondering if I can get away tomorrow to have my teeth fitted lets hope for the best.
I will close now with love to all
from your loving son
Alan
