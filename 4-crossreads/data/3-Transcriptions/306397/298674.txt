<p>On the 7th Nov; two English cruisers were sunk by "Scharnhorst" &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Gneisnau" on the Chile coast.

The "Sydney" is a big cruiser of 5000? tons with 30 more guns.<br/>Although the news sounds very feasible, I can hardly believe it, I still have hope.</p>
