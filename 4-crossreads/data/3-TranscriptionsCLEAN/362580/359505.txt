Xmas letters next.  The weather is simply beautiful now & things are much happier here too.
Miss Eyres wrote me such a nice letter too, she is a dear and it was very good of her to go out to see you.  She is such a busy woman.
Awfully sorry to hear the Thomas family are so ill.  Must try & scribble a few lines to-night to Annie.
Receive Crissie Stirlings letter every week safely & the boys do enjoy it.  Must be silly I think - should have written last week to you Belle to wish you Many Happy Returns of the Day.  Hope you will have a very, very, happy day & a prosperous year.  Trust you are all well & happy.  Mind to take the money for your birthday present & wish I was there with you.  Fondest love & kisses to you all.
FromYour loving sisterEdith.
