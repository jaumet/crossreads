<p>Tuesday 3 April 1917</p>
<p>I enclose a small snapshot of the month of the WADI El Arish. Here large numbers of "Pelicans" come &amp; feed on the fish in the shallow pools. We have had a good camp here &amp; will miss our Tents etc. when we move on to a Mobile Desert Column again. Photos are poor things to show you the beauty of the sunsets here.</p>
<p>The Fig Trees at El Arish are covered with leaves now &amp; look very pretty, make the WADI look like a park.</p>
