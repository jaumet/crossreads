<p>23rd January 1917. Went on duty at 4 oclock this morning. Did not sleep too bad in the dugout. Came off duty at 6 &amp; had breakfast &amp; then went on duty from 8 till 12.30. Off for the afternoon &amp;had a good look around our new home. Very quiet on the front, but enemy aeroplanes were frequent in their visits. Very cold through the day. Went on duty again at 5 till 8. Received letters from home and a good batch too. Looted bed etc for our dugout &amp; fixed them up tonight. Very comfortable. Just fancy a real live bed on active service. Enemy aeroplanes responsible for shelling the 27th Battery today, with the result that they had to clear out. One man killed &amp; officer &amp; men wounded. Am writing this in my dugout at 11 oclock. I go on duty for 2 hours at 12.</p>
