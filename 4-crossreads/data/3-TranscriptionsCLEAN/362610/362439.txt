  
 Friday 11 August 1916 Fine again, & very warm. In the morning attended a demonstration in the use of smoke in attack for the purpose of masking the troops. Quite successful & very interesting. Afterwards biked out to Rabaumpre where the 2nd Bn. is billeted, & after lunching with them continued on to Vignacourt in order to try & get refills for my torch. A fairly long ride besides being warm. Home in time for mess.
