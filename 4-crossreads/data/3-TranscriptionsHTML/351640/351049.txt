<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>This is Thursday the 14th day of October 1914. At daybreak I looked out through my cabin window, having noticed that the ship was stationery, and I saw that we were in smooth water between land on either side.</p>
<p>During the hour 11 p.m. &amp; midnight last night I was on the bridge with the Captain, a search light shone out ahead. He told me that we were seventeen miles (17.) from the entrance to the harbour, &amp; that the light was showing out from the entrance. Before I left him the distance was under seven miles. A keen hard wind made the atmosphere cold so bidding the bridge good night I was soon comfortably wrapped in blanket street</p>
<p>About 6-30 a.m. we commenced to move again and soon the ship passed through the openings in the nets which at night time completely cross between the limiting headlands North &amp; South. These nets serve as protection during the hours of darkness from entrance ships that might be on mischief bent. Within there opened in front of us an inland basin, the far end of which was occupied by a big fleet composed of English and French warships, hospital ships and transports,</p>
