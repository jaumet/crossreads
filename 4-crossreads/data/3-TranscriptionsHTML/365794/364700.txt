<p>Wednesday 24 October 1917<br/>After yesterday's storms a peace prevails.  Quoits favour me again &amp; I beat Miss Ralston!  Two competitions 3 p.m., "Floral wedding" at which I guessed 3 &amp; "Observation" contest &ndash; 28 out of a possible 40 fell to me.  Attestation papers re-written (not mine).  Now at 5 p.m. ship's time, Q'land time shows 1 a.m. 25-10-'17, thus we have altered.<br/>Set watch right today as alteration &ndash; daily &ndash; has ceased.<br/>Saw 12 boats during day, some outward bound, one presumably English war boat lying motionless on the ocean like a huge bull dog on guard.  Sun sets 5.45 p.m. &amp; not a cloud from sun rise to sunset, cooler weather &amp; glorious moonlight nights.  Preparations for departure continue.  Tips for stewards 5/- each.  No mess allowance charged on board.  Washing done as required for small sum.</p>
