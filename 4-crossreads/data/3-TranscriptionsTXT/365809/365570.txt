 Flanders 15-10-17 Dear Mother and Father, Am fit and comfortable again. My luck seems to stick to me alright. I think I have answered all your letters lately. There is a mail just in but it is not yet sorted. I have not drawn anything yet. Have been fairly busy buzzing about from place to place lately but have always managed to strike fairly comfortable quarters. 
 We have reorganised the Hd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qrs. Mess and now have crockery plates and cups and the tucker is much better served. We also have a white table cloth. 
 Phyllis is getting dangerous; she bites and licks me all over until I give her some sugar and then gets worse. Cheeiro Best love Your affectionate son C.R.Lucas Enclosed may be interesting. I was at the School at the time and missed the show. I think we are the only people who have attempted to run a Battalion show.
