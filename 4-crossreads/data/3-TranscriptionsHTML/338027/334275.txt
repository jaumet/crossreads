<p>Lionel's birthday<br/>Monday, 23rd November, 1914<br/>Wish him many happy returns &amp; hope his next will see him placed differently.  We sighted the Island of Socotra about 8.30 a.m. so are now in the Arabian Sea.  We surprised at the length of the island it being nearly 100 miles long.  We were only five miles from it all day long.</p>
<p>Measles have broken out badly there being twelve patients in the hospital some outside as accommodation is poor.  Malaria is suspected in one of the men.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 24th November, 1914<br/>Day wonderfully calm, sea like a vast sheet of water.  Washing day for the men again.  Expect to reach Aden to-morrow afternoon.  We are going in for water &amp; forage both are very low.  Expect to send mail so am writing some to-night.  Am on Piquet on Stores &amp; Guard room, my duties are to guard the prisoner in an empty cell.  But a guard must always be on.  There is a table seat &amp; light so one can read &amp; right.  Picquet comes every 2nd night now as so many men are in hospital.</p>
