<p>By Dukes energy I am placed at [indecipherable] table &amp; Dolleans table &amp; he gives me a rendezvous after 30/6/19. After dinner &amp; the speeches we adjourned to an enormous concert room carpeted in red &amp; hung with pictures several of the largest being naked women &amp; to me show the mark of the nation.</p>
<p>In Rue de la Paris there is a tableaux showing France or Victory surrounded by her conquering generals &amp; the figure of the woman has red teats on well formed breast &ndash; a fact emblematical of a Frenchmans mind.</p>
<p>After dinner walked along Boulevards with Duke &amp; Loepp &amp; then home.</p>
<p>19-6-19<br/>Rose about midday &ndash; a usual occurrence here &amp; then spent all the afternoon in the beautiful garden de Luxemburg, amid the cool sprays of waters.</p>
<p>The people here use chairs for the most part but they turn them towards the most beautiful spots &amp; not inwards on the path as we do.</p>
<p>In the night I make the rounds of the students Caf&eacute;, La Source being most typical &amp; the girls who frequent it the nicest &ndash; being of the [grisette] type &amp; not the pulain.</p>
<p>20-6-19<br/>Went to Bank this morning &amp; changed my last money a &pound;10 note into francs</p>
