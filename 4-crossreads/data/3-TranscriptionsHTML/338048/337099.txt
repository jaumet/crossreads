<p>The hill which I called the Sleeping Beauty has been variously termed Napoleon, Wellington, &amp; Washington Peak face etc. so I cannot say for certain which name is correct. Men-o'-war are the "[censored?]"</p>
<p>The weather here is good, the sun being hot, and a fairly strong breeze cool. Mess orderly again commencing with tea.</p>
<p>Sunday 9th<br/>Still in port on rising and had to get busy straight off with mess orderly work. Salt water for showers is cut off in port owing to its being dirty &amp; so we cannot have showers. Very hot but the wind makes things pleasant. Usual church parades but I was not present owing to mess orderly.</p>
<p>Left port at about noon and very soon we were at the same old beat again. The "Medic" "Warilda" "Demosthenes" "Laconia" in the same old positions. There is one thing which is making the voyage better now. We are going fast. Before arriving at St Vincent <strike>at</strike> our pace was only about 6 knots for several days. Well we are on the last lap &amp; mighty glad it is the last.</p>
<p>We have now an additional item of clothing, the lifebelt. This we must always wear or have with us. So we have been condemned to lugging a lifebelt around with us. It looks rediculous but of course it is necessary. There were no sing songs today.</p>
<p>[Text in margin]<br/>A Portugese River Gunboat arrived here today. It was a <strike>very</strike> peculiar craft &amp; a contrast to our boats.</p>
<p>Monday 10th<br/>Fine again and still making good speed. Rumour has it that we are to arrive in Devonport <strike>on</strike> next Monday &amp; we are to train at Wandsworth about 7 miles from London.</p>
<p>[Text in margin]<br/>This is an absolute furphy.</p>
