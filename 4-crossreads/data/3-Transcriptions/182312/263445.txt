<p>adventures, and considers that if the boot was on the other foot,</p>
<p>that is if we were in German&#39;s place, these little enterprises would</p>
<p>be nightly affairs and I have seen enough of the men who run our Naval</p>
<p>small craft to know that this would be no idle boast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the ships themselves, the big ships of the</p>
<p>Battle fleet do not at once impress a layman with their power.&nbsp; They</p>
<p>are not very big and they do not bristle with guns but to thoroughly</p>
<p>appreciate their worth you must take a tape measure to the guns for</p>
<p>here is the overwhelming force of Britains sea power.&nbsp; The ships</p>
<p>themselves do not look enormously big and their number is not very</p>
<p>great.&nbsp; It is not as if you see the entire fleet steaming by as in</p>
<p>review;&nbsp; you see it piecemeal, you see it at anchor and you see it</p>
<p>apparently idle and can not at once appreciate its worth.&nbsp; But this</p>
<p>worth has nothing to do with numbers, or with huge bulk, or with</p>
<p>lightning speed.&nbsp; Instead of counting the ships, measuring their</p>
<p>length and enquiring about their horse-power, look to their guns, for</p>
<p>it is here that the shattering power of the Grand&nbsp; Fleet resides and</p>
<p>it is xxxxxxxxxxxx this that keeps the German Navy locked in their</p>
<p>bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What surprises one about the Fleet is the enormous</p>
<p>number of auxiliary vessels xxxxx required to keep fighting ships in</p>
<p>fighting trim.&nbsp; Over there is a fleet of fast colliers and store</p>
<p>ships;&nbsp; that long low vessel with the funnel well aft is an oil fuel</p>
<p>carrier for the oil burning destroyers etc., and that big tramp looking</p>
<p>steamer is a repair ship crammed full of delicate machinery and</p>
<p>capable dealing with all kinds of fleet repairs.&nbsp; Those graceful</p>
<p>looking white liners with the green stripe are the fleet hospital</p>
<p>ships and that old &quot;wooden wall&quot; surrounded by a swarm of small craft</p>
<p>is the depot ship for the Fleet.&nbsp; Here all mails for the ships are</p>
