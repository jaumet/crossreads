3.  We have had no Comforts lately & we have have not had much from the Red Cross.  I've had 6 packets of 2d. Cigarettes & 2, 1 oz tins of Tobacco, & one shirt & a face washer from the Red Cross.  So I've not done anyone of their fair share.Fancy the Post Boys eating Jack's wedding cake.  Are you sure that the Rats were not responsible?  Gee You talk about cold.  Dad & George want to be here in the winter.  They have to shuffle about or they'd freeze hard.  Unless one keeps in perpetual motion, the toes & fingers become numbed.  I cannot write until I have had the fire going about an Hour & then the room starts to get nice & warm.  Should I have occasion to go out of the room I am careful to put my Coat & Muffler on just as if I were leaving a hot dancing Hall in the winter.  I have not been into Salisbury in Winter Time but If I have to stay here during the next winter I'll go to one or two dances.  I have my old dancing pumps here yet.Now Mum I have written quite a lot about nothing & I've only told You about one afternoon's outing.  I have very little else that I can write about & I have to write to Dad, so I'll tell Him all about
