The officer in charge (on H.M.A.S. Melbourne) issues the orders for the day which are usually transmitted  in code  by wireless to the Flagship. Here they are de-coded & transmitted on the low powered set to the transports. Before being transmitted to the transports, the Flagship hoists a certain flag signal ten minutes previous to transmitting. This signal serves as a warning. The transports now hoist the same flag signal  at half mast . Ten minutes after being hoisted on the flagship, the message is transmitted by radio (usual term for wireless). If transport receives the message OK, then the flag signal is  hoisted to the full , but not unless the message is received OK. Until the message is received the flag signal must be left at  the half  when if necessary it will be transmitted again. Usually it was never repeated & if missed, that ended it. The messages were many & of little importance. Private so & so. Number so & so etc etc. Left wife & children without support etc. Tug boat will
