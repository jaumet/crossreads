  
 April 1917 1st   We carried on with the same work to-day, but during the afternoon I received instructions to discontinue dismantling the huts & stack one, ready for transport, at the railway siding about two hundred yards away. This morning to took a photo of Smith's grave & at night one of the lads in the C.R.E. office told me he had heard that George Hart had been sent back to Australia with mental trouble. 2nd   This morning I got "an infantry" party of 50 & with 30 of them got the huts we had dismantled taken to the railway siding & stacked there.   With    The other 20 I got on cleaning up & making a few alterations at our old horse lines about half a mile away.
