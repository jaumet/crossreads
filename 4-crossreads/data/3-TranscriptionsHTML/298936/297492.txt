<p>December, 1915</p>
<p>Wednesday 8</p>
<p>Transferred to Hospital Ship early in morning.</p>
<p>As  barge drew near ship I saw a nurse on board   - first white lady for 3 or 4 months.  Seems delightful to get to comfort after the hell over there.</p>
<p>A spell will do a man a world of good.</p>
<p>Taken in cradle on a crane from barge to ship then down a lift &amp; along a corridor to ward.</p>
<p>Put in a cot with clean sheets, washed &amp; put in pyjamas.</p>
<p>Surely the [indecipherable] Castle' is an earthly heaven!</p>
