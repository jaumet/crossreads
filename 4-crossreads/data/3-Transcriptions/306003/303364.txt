<p>23-5-16<br/>20 native women &amp; children, one very old man &amp; one young man whome we brought back with us.  the women refused to come in with us &amp; were left out there also the old man;  We burnt all the Bedouin homes we came across &amp; found quite an assortment of military equipment in most of them;  At 10 oclock this morning we found 6 sheep with no owner, so they were brought back to camp by Cpl Morrice &amp; 2 men;</p>
<p>It was 6.30 when we got back to camp with empty water bottles &amp; horses just about fagged out as they were kept going pretty constant all day in the soft sand, &amp; they had no water all the time they were out;  We found a mail awaiting us when we returned which cheered us up a bit;  We saw no Turks but the 5th L.H. caught sight of some &amp; managed to capture one of them but there was no fighting;  the Turks always retire when troops from here go out to meet them<br/>Had some long range signalling today</p>
