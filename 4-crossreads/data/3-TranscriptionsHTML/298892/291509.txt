<p>Dear father,<br/>I was surprised to receive your letter stating that you had not heard from me for some time but when I considered the matter I found out that you were quite right. You have no idea how time flies here especially when we have the Hospital full. We are not overworked but still we are kept jogging along from one thing to another and before we have time to realise it another week has flown past. In future I will make a practice of writing on the same day each week and then I can't be far out.<br/>I am sorry to hear of Sam Hall's dishonesty especially at Squash's expense. By the way how is the latter</p>
