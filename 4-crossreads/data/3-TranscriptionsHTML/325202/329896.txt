<p>Jan 29/18<br/>Just returned from my second leave to Blighty &amp; expect to pull out any day for a rest The weather is quite mild &amp; we are experiencing a much better winter than last &amp; also under much better conditions than on the Somme.</p>
<p>Feb 26 Merris<br/>We pulled out here about 3 weeks ago for a Rest &amp; expect to be moving 'in' again in a few days time. This is a quiet little village between Bailleul &amp; Hazebrouck &ndash; both two fair sized country towns.</p>
