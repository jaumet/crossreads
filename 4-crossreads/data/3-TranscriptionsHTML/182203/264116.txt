<p>[Query whether this is part of the same letter as the preceding page.]<br/>I arrived here dated Aug. 5th &ndash; Our movement have been very rapid lately, that is why our letters    &amp; papers take time to reach us.<br/>I sent a book to Eddy about Windsor Castle &amp; a little robe for Bessie's infant for Eddy to take to her from Auntie Eadle. I also got two very nice loving letters from poor old Lucie. I'm so sorry you are not friendly yet. It was my quarrel &amp; I'm very grieved that it has made the unpleasantness between you all. Poor Lucie seems to be rather delicate, that neuralgia she gets is not too good.<br/>I have not seen nor heard of Fred for a few weeks but they are all on the move.</p>
