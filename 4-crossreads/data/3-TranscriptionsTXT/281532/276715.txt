 During the night there were heavy gales and rain and my fragile shelter looked like getting flooded out. A bleak cold night and terrible for "poor bloody Bill lying beleaguered wounded in a shell hole on the ridge". Some of our little bivouacs were blown clean away. Dawn showed a raw gusty and sullen day. The B.M. came with news that the left American Division had come rather a crash and were back where they had jumped off from. Later in the day a few stragglers were back this far looking for Y.M.C.A.s etc. Recd. word that our 5 Div will attack tonight and we may expect to go in tomorrow night. After dark our little bank with the battalion dug in along it was like a little Bourke St with fairy lights shining. Had to get a lot extinguished o/a Hun planes.
