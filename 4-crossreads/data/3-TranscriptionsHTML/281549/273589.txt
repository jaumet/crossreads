<p>owing to the weather being too rough.</p>
<p>Toward evening it Hailed &amp; rained very heavy. The temperature of the water was 56 deg.</p>
<p>Monday 20th the sea is still very rough but the wind has died down a lot but it is still bitterly cold on deck</p>
<p>Tuesday 21st at a few minutes to 6 o'clock I came up on deck to see the first glimpse of England. I saw the Lizard light flashing across the water from Lands End. Soon after when the light got stronger I could make out the coast line of England on the Port side, We picked up an escort of 5 Torpeado Boat Destroyers &amp; passed by the Eddystone Lighthouse &amp; Stump, shortly afterwards. All along the English channel on our way up I noticed that it was alive with steamer traffic &amp; trawlers doing mine sweeping. We dropped anchor in Plymouth Sound at 11.30 am.</p>
<p>We all left the ship in tenders and were taken across to the landing stage and were on shore in England for the first time at 5 pm.</p>
