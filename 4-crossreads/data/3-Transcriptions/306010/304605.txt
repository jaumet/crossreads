<p>Monday 29" May 1916:-<br/>Yesterday afternoon, I went for a run in the tram out to the old Provincial town of Aix - 29 km (18 miles). The journey took 2 hours &amp; was very interesting &ndash; through fertile undulating country with everything so green &amp; fresh and the fields covered with wild poppies &amp; marguerites. Had a look at the Cathedral, public dispensary &amp; museum &ndash; all of which are<u>fearfully</u> ancient. Arrived back at Marseille at 8 p.m. and then went to the Reiric[?] "Zone Novo" at the Casino de la plague &ndash; getting back to camp about midnight.<br/>Thursday 1" June<br/>Our camp is only about &frac12; mile from seafront and yesterday morning I commenced a series of early morning swims,</p>
