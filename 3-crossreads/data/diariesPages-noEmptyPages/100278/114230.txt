I did not have much of a dinner just a slice of buttered toast a mug of tea, for tea tonight, a chop bread butter a small piece of plum pudding, so our Xmas has been nothing out of the ordinary.
There was some heavy firing today our big guns were dealing it out properly Xmas day or not. The 1st Pioneer Batt. are having a big spread tonight.
"Xmas night". Have been playing "Bridge" nearly all the afternoon, we made ourselves nice comfortable fixed a table up had quite an enjoyable time, this continued until tea-time, after tea, we started again played until Len came home with his party we then set to cooked some meat had a good supper, so ended our Xmas in France.
