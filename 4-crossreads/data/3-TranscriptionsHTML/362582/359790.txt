<p>1st A.G. Hospital, Ismailia. Egypt Feb 12th 1916.<br/>My dear Jane, I'm afraid this will not be a long letter because I'm too sleepy. I am just splendid again and getting spoiled &ndash; Chicken, fish, custard, rice &amp; toast is what I'm living on at present. My "little Mary" needs a good deal of care but matron is so careful with me, that I'm sure I shall be stronger that ever after this. She is most considerate about the work I do, too &ndash; come over every now &amp; then to see that I'm not too tired nor doing too much. I went on Duty on Wednesday but she has sent us an extra sister every day since. We are very busy but not nearly so much had work as we had at first also weather is beautiful. Last Tuesday we <strike>rode</strike> had a drive out to the Canal &ndash; Three sisters and a friend in civilian (man) clothes in a Garry with two Officers on Horseback</p>
