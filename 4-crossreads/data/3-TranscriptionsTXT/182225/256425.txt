 NOV. &nbsp; THURSDAY 2 &nbsp; 1916 
 Fine. Got into London about 7.45 AM &amp; went to the Regents Palace &amp; had breakfast &amp; then on to Auntie Florence &nbsp;I went down to [?} House, the Flying Corps Headquarters &amp; got a form for a commission. Auntie, M rs &nbsp;Angus &amp; self went over the Tower of London in afternoon &amp; it was very interesting to see all the old things there &amp; compare them with the modern articles used for the same purpose. I got the 8.15 train back to camp &amp; had to walk from Amesbury &amp; that 3 mile walk just spoils a jolly welcome spell.
