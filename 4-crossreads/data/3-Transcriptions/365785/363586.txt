<p>I'd like to talk, I've heaps I could say but one has got to keep silence on almost everything when it comes to letter-writing.  By the way you told me if there was anything we wanted to let you know; well my Dear, I've been using neeless socks as covering for the poor stumps both legs &amp; arms &amp; the numbers are grievously many, they feel the cold so, and find these things such a comfort, larger ones for legs but some not very long, &amp; various lengths for both arms and legs;  they are such a boon.<br/>I hav'nt really seen much of London as the days are so short and this place is about &frac12; an hour's run by a quick train.  There are not many such these days and there will be a big reduction from Jan 1 while it is announced fares will be nearly double &ndash; so I don't get up often &amp; by the time one as done a few odd &amp; ends of shopping its pitch dark, but I'm going to have a holiday when Mer. comes over &amp; have a fly round with him.,<br/>Fancy we have old Col. Martin here now, he came</p>
