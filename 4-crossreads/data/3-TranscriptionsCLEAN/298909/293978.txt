  
 Rail head, we had to march in the sand & it was a crime to either talk - make a noise or smoke, it was terribly heavy walking, it reminded me of  the Song  Deathless army - (Solemnly & silently through the night etc.) 
 We kept in touch with our Brigade by communication wires - we arrived at the desired Point at about 3.45 am & waited for daylight. Everybody seemed to be on pins & needles, & when daylight dawned we were all disappointed the blokes that were supposed to be looking for us had not materialised, at daylight our aeroplanes then got to work & located them going northward. We started about 4.45 & got home about 7.30 am - Major Moseley said we done so well we could have the rest of the day to try & keep ourselves cool. We spent most of the day in the Canal - We brought in with the Ambulance one fellow who took a fit. this was the only casualty - excepting for sore & blistered feet - Father King said the Rosary in his little isolated tent on the desert. I helped to swell the number by attending.
