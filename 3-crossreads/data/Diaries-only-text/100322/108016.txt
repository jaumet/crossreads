Ford car down to H.Q. 2nd M.F.Coy and there met General Cam Stewart with whom I sat as member of a G.C.M on an officer charged with stealing Govt. goods cycles etc. Brought Col. St Clair home to lunch and then returned to the same place where we sentenced our friend. Returned and had a short rest before dinner engaged on matters of routine. After dinner Selleck proceeded to take a Summary of Evidence in the case of Cowan Coy. A.P.Ms and all sorts of other people came too. I spoke my bit at about 11 p.m.

A busy morning. Heard several Orderly Room cases and awarded punishments. A fine sunny day. Our mess very funny with silence ? the naughty Jacky, Freddy Geo. now very quiet.
