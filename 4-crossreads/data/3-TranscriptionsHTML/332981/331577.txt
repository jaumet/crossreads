<p>Pilot came aboard, we left at 11 am and after a pleasant journey in beautiful weather, passing several large mines &amp; large towns we arrived at Ronet for water, away again to Namur running along side &amp; crossing the River Sambre were a large number of barges were moving about, we arrived at Namur, a very large railway centre &amp; which appeared to be very busy.</p>
<p>Between Montignee &amp; Namur the railway crosses the River Sambre 15 times, it winds about so much. On the journey I noticed a large number of German engines worked by German vrews &amp; each engine had a signboard with writing on it. Not to be detained return to Allemagne, Railway Material. There were German engines, carriages &amp; trucks everywhere, the German engine drivers had a white square sign on their arms. They are being used for bringing the rolling stock from Germany to the Allies which has to be handed over.</p>
