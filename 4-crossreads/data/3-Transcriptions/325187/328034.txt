<p>[Wednesday 18 October 1916]</p>
<p>Leave by 2.7 pm train for Dolly-   Walsall is a manufacturing town &amp; a black one.  Went to "Peg o' my Heart" at the Globe Theatre, with Dolly, she was quite happy at being left alone.<br/>It was very cold coming down in the train but fine.<br/>"Peg o' my Heart" is a street thing &amp; we both enjoyed it much all about "Ould Oirland"</p>
