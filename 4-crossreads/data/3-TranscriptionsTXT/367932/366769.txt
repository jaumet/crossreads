"We evacuate this week, be ready!" we could not have advertised it more.
Well - after all! We got off - we came to Lemnos on a very crowded boat, & went ashore on the afternoon of the 20th.  There was nothing ready - they had expected wounded.  We set to & pitched tents.  Next day was no good - it rained most of this morning, there was no wood, & very little water, we lived on tinned fruit & managed to cook a Dixie of porridge each for tea.
Lemnos is a fine harbour, crammed that day with shipping, but there is no town you cannot get a bath, nor a meal, so you can imagine how we felt, when we got marching orders again.  We each have about 100 lbs of kit up - so these route marches are no joke.  Its winter now & you want a fair kit - because - goodness knows where we are going to.  It might be Saloni-ka, but most probably Egypt - but no one knows we are at sea again, that's all we are certain of.  If its Alexandria we ought to get in about Monday 27th Percy must be there I hope he is - not a bad boat this she was behind us, in the first fleet that came over it seems a long time ago!
