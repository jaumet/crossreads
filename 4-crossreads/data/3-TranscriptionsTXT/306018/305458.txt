 September 1917 at dinner time.  Had a quiet afternoon in camp. 
 Sunday 16th Went into Ismailia after dinner, had a swim &amp; tea in there, bought a few little requirements &amp; went to the pictures which were very good. 
 Monday 17th Said my adieus to Moascar left by the 2 oclock train.  Left Kantara in the trucks, but got a good lie down &amp; managed to get a bit of sleep on the run out.  Got to Rafa just after daylight, had breakfast &amp; lunch there &amp; got a train on the loop line at 12.30.  The Regt shifted camp today &amp; it was dark before I found them.  The day was terribly dusty &amp; windy.  You could only see a few yards through it. 
 Wednesday 19th Had another dusty day.  Renewed my acquaintance with the Regt.  Things are not at their best.  Its a long way for water &amp; food is not too plentiful or wood to cook it.  A man will have to put up with it.  Canteens are here but prices are enormous now, so one will have to do a certain amount of starvation
