<p>38th Battery<br/>Australian Field Artillery<br/>France   11/7/18</p>
<p>Dear Mr Garling,<br/>Will you accept my very deepest sympathy about poor old Terry.  As a "brother" battery commander &ndash; he had the 37th - &amp; I the 38th  - I would like to express my admiration of him &amp; to say how much I personally miss him.  I think it is safe to say, he was the most popular chap in the Brigade &amp; as for his Battery well they just worshipped him.</p>
