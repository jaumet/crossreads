 My room mate is a Royal Scot, by name Capt. WEIR but no relation. Yesterday we went for a sail & had Tea at the Yatch Club. All the Clubs in Alex. have made us Hon. Members. 
 Examined by M.O. today, remaining for a few days yet - expect a good mail is following me up somewhere. 
 Posted Diary & photos yesterday. I wonder how many of my letters are lost these days.  Big mail has followed me - Mother (23/6/17, 27/6/17, 17/6/17) Day 17/6/17, Laura 16/7/17, 17/7/17. Wife one a week & more. Also for [indecipherable] & Photos very good & many thanks. Also Australasians.
