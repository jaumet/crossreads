<p>France<br/>8th April 1918</p>
<p>Dear Mr Garling<br/>As a great friend of your son Terence, may I offer you my heartfelt sympathy in the great loss you have sustained by his death &ndash;<br/>Personally his death is a great blow to me, as we had soldiered together through Egypt Gallipoli &amp; the Western Front and had become very firm friends indeed &ndash;<br/>I know how fond and how proud you were of him and how severe the blow will be to you but it will be some consolation for you to know that he came by his end bravely while fighting his Battery in one of the severest fights in which our troops have taken part-<br/>Again assuring you of my deepest sympathy<br/>Believe me to be<br/>Yours Sincerely<br/>Percy J. Ross<br/>Major 41st Bty Aus. F.A.</p>
