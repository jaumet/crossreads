20 June 1915Sunday 6 wks of action
Nothing of much note during the night only a little bomb throwing a heavy cannonade at Achi after dawn they gave us heaps of shrapnel both in the valley & on the beach & when Hal & I were in for a dip they infiladed us both from Kaba Tebe & Fisherman but no one was hit though, down at the Cape the Turks put in 300 8" shells in 3 hrs & got on to our transport department. I met Frank Carter today for the first time & also Merv Knights. Another 6" gun on the beach she is a beautiful model & ought to shake up our friends once opposite. The Engineers blew up one of the submerged barges. Church was held at the rear of Courtneys Post & it sounded beautiful to hear the singing between the reports of both rifle & gun & the conclusion all the troops sang the National Anthem & it was carried right along the line.
21 June 1915Monday 35 wks from home
We attacked per rifle all along the line to estimate the true strength of our friends over opposite but met with only a feeble response. Hal & I were up early after snipers & Hal got another notch after lunch I went down to the beach for the usual & just missed a Johnson it landed 6 ft away & didnt bust. I received great news down there the French had taken a mile of trenches & large bodies of Turks were reported (per aero) to be moving in a NW direction right into us, they took also an entire line of 2 trenches & held them. Mail arrived but I only got 3 papers. The Engineers finished the Pier today & it has been called "Watson Pier", oil engines have been installed for pumping purposes. Any amount of artillery from the Turks & high explosive stuff at that they have been trying to get on to the tunnel from Steels point but beyond giving our chaps some spice hunting they havnt done much damage. Bridge till 10
