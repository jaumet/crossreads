16-5-19 (Frid)Have breakfast in bed always at this place - it is the only meal they serve & catch train back to camp.
The countryside is a glorious patch of enclosed fields with yellow buttercup lawns & flowering white hawthorn hedges whilst everywhere trickles small rivulets.
I arrive at camp & no one knows anything of NME & I wish I had stayed in London as this trip has cost me 16/- & a fatiguing walk of nearly 3 miles to camp. After dinner I wander up on the hill which rises steeply in rear of our quarters.
The whole side is covered with primrose & daisy & a small blue flower a glorious coloured carpet of colour while as if this were not beautiful enough, every flower is connected with silvery threads of spiders forming a silken avenue stretching away to the setting sun. The scene below is beautiful.
All fields now covered by the young crops are carpets of vivid green below like a snake amongst the lovely winds with many a twist a little rivulet which somewhere perhaps becomes a river. The picturesque train (now normal length 10 carriages) in the distance with typical white steam - the hedges now irregular with over hanging boughs - here & there a thicket or copse and a plantation denser by its very isolation form a picture that one only expects to see in a book.
