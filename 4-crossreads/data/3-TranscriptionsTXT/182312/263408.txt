side of the Cunarder &quot;Saxonia&quot; on which vessel we embarked. &nbsp;She short-
ly afterwards moved out into the harbour and anchored for the night&nbsp;
so as to allow us to organise the troops before venturing out into
the submarine area, and as we had 3,500 men aboard this took some
doing. &nbsp;3,500 men does not sound much, but when you get them on a&nbsp;
ship - even a 15,000 tonner like the &quot;Saxonia&quot; - you will find that
they have to pack together like passengers on the Ferry Boats during
the busy hours. &nbsp;Everything being made ship-shape we put to sea the
following morning about breakfast time. &nbsp;The men had been told off
to their life boats or rafts and deck spaces were allotted where
the men were to parade on an alarm being given. &nbsp;These alarms were&nbsp;
given at least twice a day to get the men used to their positions
and so avoid confusion and panic should real danger threaten, in
fact them men never knew but what each alarm might be a genuine one.
Life belts were worn the whole time, but officers were allowed to&nbsp;
take theirs off whilst messing, but had to hang them over their
chairs. &nbsp;The only time the men took theirs off was when they went
to bed and then they were compelled to use them as pillows so as to
be in readiness. &nbsp;We had one night alarm - about 10 o&#39;clock one night
and our Company was the first to report &quot;All present and correct&nbsp;
on alarm station&quot;, the time being 12 minutes. &nbsp;When you consider
that the ship was in absolute darkness and also the narrow stair-
ways leading up from below, 12 minutes was quite a good performance.
There were numerous minor casualties through men falling over winches,&nbsp;
steampipes etc. in the dark, but nothing serious. &nbsp;Notices were
posted up warning men that should anyone fall overboard the ship
would not be stopped as by doing so, she would be a target for
submarines and the lives of 3000 odd would not be risked for the sake
