 and made them into bundl and slept that night . The next day we complet the raft all readi for launch , that night . In the afternoon we christen the raft name it " Success " . We read the servic from a prayer book which we carri in a veri solemn earnest way , sprinkl water on as we name it . I am afraid had we had anyth better than water it should not have been wast on the christen . About 8.30 p.m. we launch the raft on to the creek It was veri heavi and we had great difficulti in get it down into the water , Howev we got it out into about three feet of water . It certain look a success . One of us got on it and stood the strain but when the two of us got on it bare float . Certain not good enough to put to sea in . It was a huge disappoint . After a short consult we decid to pull the raft back to the same place so that it would not be discov , the follow day , and a search made . We did this and then move about three mile further along the beach . There was a well close by and we found an excel hide place right on the beach where we could see ship by day and if they came in close enough we could make a signal without be seen by anybodi on shore . We decid to stop there . The follow day we could see a larg villag about two mile away . We were just about run out of food so my mate suggest that he should go over to this villag and tri and buy some bread and chanc be caught , for we would have to give ourselv up in a coupl of day in ani case from want of food . About 9 a.m. he set off in the direct of this villag . He had not gone far befor he met an old man and woman ride on donkey , and he ask them if they had anyth to sell . They said they had not but direct him to the villag just outsid there were two old men prune grape vine . He ask them where he could buy certain articl . They told him to ask for a certain name , this man be the head man or Mahommedin priest of the villag and that he would attend his want . My mate went on to the villag and see a small boy ask for this certain man . The boy knew who he want and direct him . It turn out that this was his son . Howev when they met the old man want to know who he was . My mate said he was a German telegraph Mechan work on the line between Mersina and Selefka . The old man clap him on the back and said how pleas he was to meet one of his German brother . Then he ask what he could do for him . My mate repli that he want bread and egg as we had run out of provis and would not be abl to go into headquart to get more till this job was finish . The old man repli that it was veri difficult to get anyth there as there was such a shortag of bread . He said he would see what he could do . After bring my mate a cool glass of water from the well and a plate of fresh fig the old man went out into the villag to see what he could get . Short after he return
