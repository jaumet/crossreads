<p>Sohag</p>
<p>Revielle at 5.30</p>
<p>Stables as usual.</p>
<p>Horses tipped for tomorrow are getting a little extra attention today &amp; great excitement prevails as to whose stable is going to hold the winners, the money has shortened a bit, mine is now 2 to 1 &amp; Bill M is even money.</p>
<p>Messed around all day &amp; wrote letters. Pard &amp; Freddy went out to the catacombs on Push bikes, they saw the old mummy that we found when we were out there, they got home about dark tired out.</p>
<p>Played chess with Smithy &amp; others &amp; turned in at 10.10 pm.</p>
<p>CO received a letter from Downing who isn't having too rosy a time, Charlie also got one from Bob who also is up to his neck in it.</p>
<p>17 April, 1916 Monday</p>
<p>79 wks from home</p>
<p>Hopped out as usual</p>
<p>Set off to the Palms at nine as usual, horses in the pink of condition &amp; men eager for the days sport, got work finished early &amp; at 11.30 rode out with Jack Latham up on the back, on the way out he shot a couple of dogs with my revolver, led off to the course at 2 after the usual prelims we lined up for the first heat, my mount was as eager as fun, got a splendid start &amp; after a great go with Hal was beaten by a head for first. Mustards ran a bad last, the 2nd heat went to Charlie Cox on Algy with Billings second, in the 3rd heat Brown on  Larkins mare won with Goty a near second, the final was great &amp; no one could pick the winner. I had the inside running &amp; got a poor start &amp; only ran into 3rd place, Charlie Sting came off Waugh &amp; came well nigh to getting hurt but got out of it OK.</p>
<p>Wrote more letters &amp; turned in at 10 pm.</p>
