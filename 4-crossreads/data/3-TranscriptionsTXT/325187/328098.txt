 [Friday 22 December 1916] 
 El Arish   Paid all Ranks- Trawlers &amp; Gunboats came in this morning &amp; landed after sweeping up the mines.  The local Egyptians pretend they are glad to see us but they sent up 2 pigeons as soon as we entered. Infantry &amp; Guns arrive today but the 1st L H had the honor of being the first to enter the town. Already ships are arriving with horsefeed &amp; Rations.  The railway will follow.  I am back in my old job as Adjutant. The Anzac Division attack MAGDHABA tomorrow a stronghold of the Turks.
