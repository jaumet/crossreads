I now add a few remarks of my experiences and impressions. When the King and Queen came out from the Palace to take the Salute, that was a moment I had always long for, to see the King and Queen in the flesh, as I had so often seen them in the Pictures. It gave me great pleasure to stand "to attention" when the band played the National Anthem and the Officers saluted the King. I stood among the crowd for a while watching the Troops on the March and as each Divisional Flag with a Wreath on the top was passing the Civilians took off their Hats out of respect for the fallen. I then walked along the Mall where a number of White Wooden Pillars were erected decorated with Flags of each division and Wreaths and names of places were the Guards had fought. These were erected on the side of the road, from the statue and along the Footpaths were huge crowds running into many thousands and with the cheering and waving of Hankies and coloured flags made an impressive sight.
