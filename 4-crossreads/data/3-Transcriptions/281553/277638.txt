<p>Aug. 19th<br/>Lay in Lemnos all day, sailed at 4-45 p.m. in two boat loads of 1000 each.  Reached coast for dissembarking 12-30 &amp; started landing about 3-30 a.m. in pontoons of about 60 men.  Only ashore about 2 hours when enemy guns got range of our late ship which soon put her to sea.  Seeing the nature of the land, the earlier troops who have gained it deserve utmost credit, it seems almost impossible to take.</p>
