<p>May 6<br/>116.<br/>Real rain &ndash; big heavy splashing rain and then clear air, and clearness over the fields:  this last night.  This morning clear but dull leaden skies, and a heat in the air from a hidden sun.</p>
<p>Early &ndash; about 3 a.m., a great bombardment, and the early morning of yesterday another.  But the casualties from the line, keeping well down.</p>
<p>117.<br/>Turning in I read a short tale of Balzac's in "Christ in Flanders" &ndash; "El Verdugo".  It's a tale I've read of &ndash; referred to in some essay of Wilde's or some such writer &ndash; of a Spanish noble family &ndash; sentenced to death, meeting death at the hand of the family's firstborn.  That the line might be unbroken, at the commands of the whole family, the eldest acts as executioner.</p>
<p>It opened up a long argumenting in the cellar as to the most desirable method of death &ndash; by hanging or beheading, Les and self favouring beheading, the majority for hanging.  There is something grotesquely horrible about the gibbet and the disjointed marionetting of a neck-hung corpse.</p>
<p>The block is definite and clean from grotesquerie.</p>
<p>May 6<br/>115.<br/>Mail, T.L.S., May 2, and a Balaclava from Australia!  T.L.S. good in announcements but poor in reviews.  Francis Ledwidge's last book &ndash; posthumous "Last Songs" received with J. Stephen's "Reincarnation".  J.C. Squire's "The Gold Tree" announced in a limited signed edition of 500 copies at half a guinea!  Wrote to T.B.C. for it and Cardinal Gibbons' "Faith of Our Fathers", and to C.W. Beaumont a 20 F. note for "Tale of Igor" &amp; "The Little School" of Sturge Moore's.  (Payed today!)</p>
<p>Another half guinea book &ndash; books are the two volumes of Herbert Trench, "Poems:  with Fables in Prose":  no review but the publishers Constable.  Grant Richards definitely announces Waugh's Resentment and two books of S.P.B. Mais &ndash; "A Schoolmaster's Diary" and "Lovers of Silver", both at 6/-.</p>
<p>James Joyce is seemingly of the moderns, his novel "The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" broke the old orders in its title, and by a few reviews seemed good.  Two of his plays are now out, "Dubliners", 5/- and Exiles, 3/6, both by G.R.</p>
<p>Now "The Oracle of Colour" from Beaumonts is overdue:  but always books from him have been long delayed, then the charmingly written letters of apology accompanying the books at last are as enjoyed as the parcel itself.</p>
