 Went ashore &amp; by courtesy of the garrison Artillery  we were shown thro' all the galleries &amp; forts-   The huge rock is tunnelled in every direction &amp; has 2 years Rations stored.  Aerial tramways convey stores to the top-    it is not unlike a great big lion guarding the entrance of the  Mediteranean-  No ill effects of inoculation- The summit of rock is 1000 ft &amp; commands the  Algerian  Coast  I must not put on paper too much about the Armaments-  Tomorrow is a Bull fight but as I have no Mufti am afraid cannot go across neutral ground to  Spain  a big iron picket fence separates  Gibraltar  from  Spain
