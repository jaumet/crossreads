Our chief annoyance is having no place to sleep. No decent arrangements for the A.M.C. Slept on deck this night.  Reveille at 6 am    &  it made no difference to the boys, who are so tired. However we are soon made to move by the deck cleaners with a big hose. Excitement    &  a lot of speculation is aboard as to whether we are to put into Melbourne next day. 
 The calm weather gives place to a strong breeze with a promise of a rough sea. Man fell down the hold near wet canteen &  we carried him to hospital. Another man cut foot awfully with razor. Several stitches put in    &  sent to bed
