<p>the trench opposite to him was lightly held. Patrols were constantly out till dawn came at 3 a.m. when everything was quiet once more. Friday 21 June<br/>Nearly got  hit in the head by a bullet today; one of our 'planes was up &amp; the Huns were firing with their machine guns. I was just drying my face with a towel after shaving. &amp; was standing in the trench talking, &amp; I stepped aside as Sgt. Dwyer came along &amp; stood where I had been. There was a crack as a bullet fired at the aeroplane hit on the sergeant's steel hat, knocking a hole in it &amp; then falling off. What luck, eh, there was I without a hat on, so it would have gone through my skull. Had a sleep &amp; read all day, the front is very quiet &amp; only for the artillery you would hardly know there's a war on. We saw a big black dog run across No Man's land &amp; into the wood by Fritz's trenches today, some of them fired at him but missed him, I suppose he was carrying a message. The confounded rain came on again tonight, &amp; it was sticky &amp; miserable underfoot. I had to go with a party to 15 platoon, deepening &amp; widening a trench, &amp; it was a rotten job &ndash; you got wet if you didn't wear your macintosh, &amp; if you did wear it you could hardly use the pick &amp; shovel so not much work was done; didn't the chaps roar, eh!</p>
