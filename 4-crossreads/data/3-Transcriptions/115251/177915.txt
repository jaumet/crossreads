<p>To the Commander of HMAS Ship Australia</p>
<p>Sir,<br />In the name of three more prisoners I ask you kindly to submit to His Excellency the Admiral the following<br />We <u>four</u> prisoners are private business people from Herbertsh&ouml;he and never had any part whatsoever in this war.&nbsp; Only on Sunday morning we came on our own to the head quarters at Herbertsh&ouml;he to get pass-ports in order to continue our regular work.</p>
