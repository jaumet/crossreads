5 April, 1916Selhai [Salhia]This morning they turned us out at three oclock, & it was all bustle.  When watering horses we struck trouble & were delayed but got away shortly after six.  It was a long dreary ride across the desert to this place about 25 miles but into a fine camp here.  We have the lines down & the tents up & already are more comfortable than at Serapeum.  We have mess sheds here which are a boon after the sand.  I felt a new man after a good [indecipherable]& a shave
Tom was telling me how he was up before the Major this morning, he came along with the baggage on the train & it appears that he was doing a galloping stunt on a donk in the village here & rode express into a cafe where the Brigade Major was having some eggs etc.  the donc propped & slid along the floor knocking the B.M's table over.  Tom was told to be more careful in future.  I fancy the young beggar has been having a good time. hes wearing a vivid red handkerchief round his neck & I heard him tell Johno that he does not know how  it came to be in his possession
[General Chauvel moved his headquarters from Serapeum to Sahlia]
