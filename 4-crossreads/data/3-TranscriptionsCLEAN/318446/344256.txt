  
 March 24th On our arrival here - Kilo 152 where the 3rd Bgde. were camped - we were met by two hostile planes which were fortunately beaten off by our guns before they could do any damage.  I believe that yesterday our troops went out to Gaza from Rafa - which is now the front line - but I don't know if it is true or not. We have heard the A.A. guns shooting at hostile planes nearly every morning but they have been a long way off. 
 March 26th Great guns booming all day today - the real attack on Gaza is in progress. According to what I can hear there are 15000 turks there & we have either two or three Infantry divisions attacking.  The guns we have heard all day today must be the monitors as it is 50 miles away & otherwise we could not hear them.
