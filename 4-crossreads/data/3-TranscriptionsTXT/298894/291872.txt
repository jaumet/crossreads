Each one just a soldier with individual fadsHerbert is the captain & sings a decent songHe's made himself quite popularThough we haven't known him long.He's pretty good at tennis, in church he has some rankand serves the mess as treasurer, as experienced in the bank.
III. Greenwell is his neighbour, his place he proudly fillsHe's got a troubled stomach, so we designate him pills.He turns in pretty early & isn't long awake.He'll pass his time most pleasantly if sitting near a cake.
IV. Then we have Young Jonesy, a lad who's here to learn.He wants to get a cross or two then safely return.There's not much doubt about him, he's willing and he's bright.We'll one & all stand by him & help him inhis fight.
V. Brother Andrews - Padre bears a double CrossThe red one on his arm & the other - Life's great loss.Today he's just a soldier with a dollar clear a dayBut his precept & example preaches more than he could say
