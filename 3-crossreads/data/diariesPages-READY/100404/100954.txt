Saturday 22nd About one pm I was sent for to see a man in C Squadron and as soon as I saw him I at once rang for an urgent car, I took him to No 3 Hosp and just got him there and that was all for he died of Euremia shortly after. My Dr was out of camp. My brother arrived during the day from Serapeum looking well, his transfer has gone astray. We went into town together to concert at Anzac Hostel where he stayed for the night. I had a feeling something was wrong so returned to camp just in time to answer telephone to prepare report for post mortem.
