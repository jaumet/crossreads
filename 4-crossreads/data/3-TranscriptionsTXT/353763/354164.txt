Our men fell back & then found out what was up  -  The guns of the fleet should have searched that scrub before a man was moved  -  You see my circles by the side of the road - in the jungle - carefully concealed pits with a nigger in each blazing away at our men's backs & also niggers in trees shooting - of course these pits were rushed & the niggers bayoneted & the men in the trees potted one by one  -  One nigger was potted by a sailor man & fell over a limb  -  Up goes the gallant tar   -  & shoves him off - plump - on to mother earth - the last move that nigger ever put up= That's the tale of the Kabakaul scrap & our light regard of German strategy & foresight = A few more Germans & we'd have got simple hell   -  & a bit of the Boer war over again with its silly episodes of careless trust & want of ordinary foresight  -  Of course we win but life is chucked away needlessly  -  At least so the Fleet says & I'm a full blown Naval authority now   -  !!!!
