<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen Les, and he looks very well, how glad we were to see each other, why, it was the supreme moment in many, many weary months.&nbsp; Yes, I had notes from Les, telling me &quot;Slowly moving up&quot; - &quot;Soon will be near you&quot; - and I kept in touch through official channels with the movement of his Division.&nbsp; Then I learned that they had come within about twentyfive miles of our position and one fine Sunday while &quot;out&quot; of the trenches I decided to look him up; the decision was made at 1 o&#39;clock p.m., by two o&#39;clock I was provided with a pass and on my way; the first stage of the journey was accomplished on foot, three miles to the town of Baillieul where as I expected, a motor lorry was found travelling in the right direction, and then by changing to a mule cart and again to another lorry I was transported to the point on the main road nearest to his Division&#39;s billets, then by country roads I walked the next four miles and was so fortunate to get right to his billet and to find a knot of Divvy.Sigs standing outside; a figure detached itself from the group and walked towards me and then for the first time in two years I saw old Les.&nbsp; Of course we were feeling very enthusiastic and personally I would like to have given him a big hug, but for the sake of appearances we shook hands in a somewhat listless style and enquired very casually &quot;How are you taking it&quot; and agreeing too, in the same style</p>
