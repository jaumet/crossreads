 The inset copy of Defence S.380 of 20.5.20 is forwarded for your information:- 
 &quot;Commandant, 
 2nd Military District. 
 It is noted that some Districts in the course of correspondence refer to Officers and other ranks as Captain....M.C. and Bar, Major.....D.SO. and Bar, Corporal....D.C.M. and Bar. 
 2. The practice of adding the words &quot;and Bar&quot; to the designation of the Decoration to which the person concerned may have been awarded a Bar is incorrect. 
 3. For purposes of correspondence etc the designation of the Decoration only is to be used, even though the person referred to may have been awarded a Bar to the decoration. 
 4. It is also noted that Officers holding Brevet, Honorary, or Temporary Rank are signing official correspondence and orders as .......Captain and Brevet Major......Major (Hon. Lieut-Colonel) etc. This is not correct. In such cases the rank to be shown is the highest whether it be Brevet, Honorary Temporary or substantive.&quot;
