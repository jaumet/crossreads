<p>The saluting base was firm.  The Marseillaise sent the people mad and we were almost suffocated.</p>
<p>The whole route &ndash; and it embraced all the principle streets of the city were packed and the flowers were all along the way.</p>
<p>At the Station right on top of the hill we halted in front of a large French hospital:  here a French bugle band was playing and the music of it was splendid.</p>
<p>Champagne was the next order, and we consumed royally of it.  France was the general toast and "It"s a terrible war".</p>
<p>The march back was jolly tiring and by the time we got back to Camp we were dead beat but happy.  The break was a purple patch in a field of dead sand.</p>
<p>31<br/>At the fountain &ndash; where flags were being given out, Capt. Ross discovered he hadn"t one.</p>
<p>"For Christ"s sake let us get one", says he, "otherwise they"ll think I"m not patriotic", and he made a dive through the crowd.</p>
<p>Then outside left one of the four in front of me marching back had on his arm a jolly decent little French girl &ndash; who dragged a howling kiddy along with her.  Poor kid &ndash; Stan was having the time of his life but for the kid?</p>
<p>We halted.  The girl halted and the kiddie howled.</p>
<p>"Hallo Kid!" says a beautifully dressed and square <u>looking</u> woman on the pavement.  "You"ve got a very nice girly there eh?" "and is that yours too?" she asks.  Poor Stan!  He hasn"t heard even the beginning of that yet.</p>
<p>32<br/>Peter was talking to me the other day about Russian writers:  Trotski, Tolstoi, Turgenev and other names came up.  He summed up Artzstashof [?] in his queer English:  it amounted to this, "Artzstashof he like a painter who paints a mountain and some trees so it look like when you are way away from it what the mountain look like when you see it:  he not like a painter who make the picture more beautiful than the mountain.  He like the French painters who you see in windows here in Marseille."  Realism undoubtedly doesn"t appeal to Peter &ndash; though Post realisms do.</p>
<p>33<br/>On Monday morning so as to have money if we were dismissed in Marseille as we expected, I borrowed 5F. from Geoff.  Not being dismissed but marched back to camp I didn"t break it.  Bill was going out and was scouting out money so I offered to lend him a couple of Francs:  he had one and he gave me that &ndash; leaving 4:  2 he was to return.  Next morning he was going into town and I asked him to call in at Raemaekers exhibition and get me a catalogue.  He called in and paid for one to be sent on.  While he was in town and the night before the 5 note was too much for him and it vanished.  Geoff asked me to come into town just before lunch and I said I would:  got dressed and asked Bill for the 2F.  Poor Bill, he never got such a shock in all his life, he hadn"t a cent.  He went out and God knows where he got it but he came back with 5 more and he, Geoff and myself went into town.  Geoff handed me 1F. more.  Thank God somebody"s got some money.</p>
