had dinner at a flash restaurant then went out to Barry Island by train to the sea, here we had a good old time in the water it was the first time I had had a dip in the ocean for a long long time I can tell you it was splendid, after this we had a stroll round the beach saw so curious sights, such as girls undressing dressing on the sand no one seems to take any notice so I suppose its a regular custom, from here back to the city down to the Louis Caf one of the leading ones in the city, I had a dinner here last night I was invited to a picnic the Staff are holding tomorrow so my mate I are going to see what kind of a show they are pulling off we went to the New Theatre from here saw "The Belle of New York,"
