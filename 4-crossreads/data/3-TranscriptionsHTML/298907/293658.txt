<p>lovely &amp; green, lots of people come out here from the city, there is a fine restaurant &amp; garden here also, &amp; a walk though the grounds is something to be remembered.</p>
<p>Had another bonza afternoon, met our girls again at the 5 Ways, &amp; then walked down to the Botanical Gardens, they are very small but nicely laid out, after strolling round a while we selected a nice grassy little patch &amp; sat down for the rest of the afternoon &amp; done a bit of spooning, practicising of course for the time the right girl comes along, I have been very bashful &amp; shy in the past you know so I am rapidly making up leeway, I only wish I had started before for I can see what a good time I have missed, never mind</p>
