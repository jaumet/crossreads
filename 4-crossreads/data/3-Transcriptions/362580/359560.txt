<p>Dear Bella,</p>
<p>It's been awfully good of you to write such topping notes occasionally, 'specially as I've been rather remiss in not answering, hope you won't strafe me too severely, 'cos I love to get those letters from "Ilkley" in the little bundle of mail, &amp; hear just how you're all keeping.  Thanks so much for the Xmas card and your last letter dated 4th Jany.  Guess young Eddie's grown almost out of recognition by now, how does he take to games &amp; swimming, Bel?</p>
<p>Can just imagine the joy chez vous on Ede's arrival, what a gorgeous time &ndash; much falling-on necks &amp; crying into ones tea, hurray! what!  Was ever so pleased to hear that they were giving her the chance of going home, if anyone ever deserved it, Ede did, 'cos she's worked like a jolly Trojan under rotten conditions &amp; has kept cheery &amp; smiling right through &ndash; an absolute Briton &ndash; hope she has a ripping time.  It was positively "bon" (as the boys say) to meet her in London just before she sailed &amp; only wish I could have spent more time</p>
