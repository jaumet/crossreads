<p>When leisure came I wrote you &amp; also Turner &amp; I thought I should get a chance to-day to send part of my serial tale but its washed out  -  This morning I dolled up &amp; went on to the Flagship to see the PMO  -  Saw him &amp; then went down to the Sick bay &amp; saw all his contraptions  -  A very light bamboo stretcher</p>
<p>[drawing of a stretcher]<br/>with folding side flaps I liked muchly for use in ships, mines &amp; elsewhere  -  He showed &amp; examd  -  a Sailor at 29 with something wrong with his right eye  -  He seemed to me to have overused it in shooting  -  He was a very good rifle &amp; revolver shot  -  If it is so it's the first case I've seen of that sort  -  It's the Peep sight said the Sailor  -  His vision field was limited &amp; his pupil dilated to a medium size = o  -  Left pupil = o Color vision normal  -</p>

<p>We are leaving Rabaul to  - morrow for unknown parts &ndash; with the fleet &ndash; whole or in part  -  It's grand dry weather &amp; we are &ndash; as a company &ndash; all well  -</p>
