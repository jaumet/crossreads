<p>In the afternoon there was no parade.  I went on main guard at night.</p>
<p>Saturday 17th [Apr]<br/>Was let off main guard as there were too many warned.  There was a general clean up of the lines in the morning.  In the afternoon there was a buckjump riding exhibition but nobody managed to ride the horses.  A Squadron played C Squadron cricket resulting in a win for C on the first innings.</p>
<p>Sunday 18th<br/>Did nothing all day except stables.  It is pretty slow in camp.  It is impossible to sleep or rest as the flies are so troublesome.  Was warned for picket tonight.  B Squadron played C Squadron cricket, C Squadron winning.</p>
<p>Monday 19th<br/>Got ready for town police patrol.  About 68 men of the 6th are to put in a week at [indecipherable] Barracks.</p>
