<p>25 May, 1916<br/>Kantara<br/>At Stand to was told to be ready to leave at 5.30 for Rail Head &amp; to go &amp; get some stuff for the Squadron at Kantara &ndash; I had the requisitions in already - [indecipherable] &amp; I went  [down?] for two troops each.  Just missed the train but "jumped  the rattler" at 9.0 in spite of being told we could not go by that train   Got in &amp; bought the stuff but could not get out away so have  to stay the night</p>
