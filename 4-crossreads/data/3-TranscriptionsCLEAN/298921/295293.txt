  
 November, 1915 Tuesday 30 Letters are going to be few and far between now - Too cold & wet to write all is covered with snow but we will see it out. I am wearing Flannel shirt, Cardigan Jacket, Sheepskin Jacket Overcoat Macintosh Bear Skin cap & 2 pairs of soks in my brother Officers boots - We all wear the same boots if possible as they are warm for the new man when he goes on duty.  The "old man plain" on a winters night is nothing to this Peninsular. Odd Turks gave themselves up poor half frozen clad beggars.
