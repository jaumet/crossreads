<p>Australian mail yesterday. Got two letters. Was on guard last night from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. Weather was very dirty. My post at the forecastle, at the head of the steps leading to the crews quarters. Struck an old chap who knew the Bay and had quite an interesting yarn with him. It was fairly cold but I was lucky enough to strike about 1 quart of hot coffee about 12 o'clock. Then once again I faced the rigours of the night. When I turned in at 3 I slept like a log. To-day our coy was to have gone ashore but wind blew so hard that when we got into the boats we could make no headway. Tea was a bit miscellaneous to-night. There was a tin of boned mutton left over from dinner. Then there were pickles bread butter and jam. When we had nearly finished we got a surprise packet in the way of some rice &amp; currants. However our hospitality was easily capable of including it also. When I had finished and found there was nothing more eatable at our table I made inquiries at the next</p>
