 10/12/18 Caudry Awoke and up at 8.30. The Canadian Town Major presented us with a good breakfast. Lorryhopped to Le Cateau and there caught another which took us to Landrecies. Changed lorries here into an artillery column and went on to Avesnes. the country now began to undergo a remarkable change becoming enclosed. Very green and covered with hedges &ndash; just like Somersetshire. Rain commenced now. Made for 4th Div. When at Avesnes lunched and then went to Corps HQ where I found out the location of the battalion. Returning down the street met a YMCA man and had afternoon tea at their HQ. A 6th   Btl car drove up then and took me out to the very little hamlet of Bologne &ndash; not unlike Selles. Had a yarn to the General and then back to Mess. Bean spent the evening getting history from us.
