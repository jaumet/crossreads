  
 The Jealous Lover 
 I would take your little throat in my hands Slight to snap as a flower stem But I could not kill the light in your eyes It would still be found in the morning skies A valley pool or a turquoise gem 
 I could hush your voice with my finger's press Leave you a broken silent thing But the lilt of the bird in the green scrub heart The sough of the wind and your tones would start And your words in the soft rain sing 
 I could tear you out of my soul to day Learn to hate & curse you too Give my heart to the surgeon's knife But what were the use of a shattered life Bleeding to death for need of you
