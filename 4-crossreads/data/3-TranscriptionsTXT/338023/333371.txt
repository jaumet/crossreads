 [Page 178] 
 [Page 2 of the letter is part 2 of page 178] a despatch. My rolled g.coat &amp;    oil sheet  w.p. cape actually  saved me from joining the great majority and when they were disentangling me from my gear somebody went to a lot of trouble to wake me up &amp; tell me I'd topped the list of the Lucky. 
 Anyhow it was a great kick and what worries me most is that it blew my souvenirs to glory &ndash; they were good ones too, including buttons, a watch &amp; pr glasses which had only been in my possession 20 minutes! 
 It took me 8 days to get this far &amp; I'm expecting to be hopping round to-morrow or next day. After that I may

 Yesterday Austn RedX visitors called and left me papers, writing material etc, for this letter &amp; bless them, a complete toilet outfit including a tip-top razor. 
 Ypres is a good place to be away from &ndash; war there has got down to about the lowest possible hell of filth and black ruin. Theres not a yard of ground that has not been torn up by HE. Just at the part I got caught in there are only three foot tracks in a mile to get through the shell holes, many of which are from 10 to 30 ft deep &amp; half full of water &ndash; death traps full of death itself. Awful.
