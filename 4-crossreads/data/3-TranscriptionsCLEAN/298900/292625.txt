Saturday 2nd Feb 18   Frost disappeared today the sun coming out & making everything mucky through the thaw.   In the afternoon took a car to collect drugs at Outtersteene but took patients to Dranoutre, [indecipherable] & the C.C.S. at Nieffe on my way.   Had trouble with punctures but managed to get a new tire, our final mishap being a skid into a ditch through trying to pass a lorry on a greasy road.    Luckily we did not capsize & another lorry pulled us out without difficulty.   Collected my stores, a big load, chiefly dressings & returned to our station, Young street M.D.S. about 6 P.M.    Did some writing at night.
Sunday 3rd Feb   Had a busy day sending out dressings & supplies to the different posts etc.    Weather beautiful.   Practically no wounded coming through but a few sick.
Monday 4th Feb   Nothing of moment.   Weather good.   Have now got the station in pretty good order looking well & fit for anything.   Had a bath at night before a fire.   Tackled French again.
