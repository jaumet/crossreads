Friday 10 May
A couple of days ago a curious incident happened in the air on this front. Owing to a Frenchman being out of his area, not returning a Britisher's signal, he was shot down by the Englisher killed. Another Frenchman was brought down with a hole in his petrol tank. Both Frenchmen were good fliers. The Funeral of the Frenchman took place to-day from here, attended by Australian French officers men.
Quiet to-day. "B" beat "A" Section at cricket.
Saturday 11 May
Glorious day to-day we have been doing nothing but loaf round camp, playing cricket football. Rumour hath it that we go to the line again to-morrow, on the Strazeele front, right of where we have just been relieved.
