 September 1918. Tuesday 10 
 In Reserve. 4 miles from Peronne. Spent a very quiet day, writing letters, Home and abroard. Weather very miserable all day. Heavy rain made our gully like a drain pipe. Having quite a spell and now doing nothing else but sleep and eat all day Mr Mays censored my letters. Rumors of going out very shortly for a little spell, near Amiens. Read despatch in the London Times.
