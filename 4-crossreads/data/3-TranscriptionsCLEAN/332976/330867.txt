June 19171st.   We went out to the same job again this morning & returned at midday.   In the afternoon I went down with a sapper & made a survey of the trenches for plotting on the map.   The concert is still in progress & is well patronised by the Australians & tommies.2nd.   The section went carried on with the same job again this morning, but I remained behind & plotted the new trenches on the Ordinance Survey Map. 57c  N.W.3.There were sports held in the afternoon with the 8th F.C.A.E. & R.Es. which will be continued to-morrow.   At about 6 o'clock we had a heavy shower of rain & the temperature fell soon after.
