 Feb. 27 Saturday 1915 The Brigade on parade mounted this morning. Major Fuller &amp; party out of camp. Posted photos to Clem Taylor, Jefferies &amp; mother &amp; Maude. Went to Cairo, back 11. 0 am also letter to Maude &amp; Mother. 2 Battalions of Australian Infantry left under sealed orders for unknown parts today. Saw a large Wealthy funeral in Cairo headed by police, then 4 men carrying an elaborately worked cloth by the 4 corners, then the Parson followed by chorister boys in colored surplices, chanting, then the coffin richly decorated, no flowers, after which the mourners walked behind hearse followed by a number of women on carts drawn by mules, and all making a wailing hideous noise. The square cloth carried by 4 men signifies = asking for mercy for the deseased = a Greek idea.
