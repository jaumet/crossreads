<p>France<br/>25 April 1917</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. John</p>
<p>Just before leaving England I got three splendid letters from you, and I assure you those three old letters were the best friends I could have had today:  you see I generally get the blues when travelling as a soldier, goodness only knows why &ndash; it seems to make one realise each time how little one knows about the war, &amp; to realize how long it may last, and then in sequence I wonder when I shall get back to old Australia, and that completely does me in:  I've gradually got more &amp; more homesick, and the travelling brings it out:  it seems so useless spending days doing nothing, waiting on steamers &amp; trains, always crowded, &amp; always waiting for orders.</p>
<p>So being by way of an old hand now, &amp; knowing myself, I saved up your letters till now.  I'm well fed, comfortable fire, ink to write with and so on:  and I've read the letters &amp; got cheerful once more:  and the cheerfulness will last me on till I get up to the front &amp; have a job again to do.</p>
<p>I got offered two permanent jobs in England &ndash; and one out here as an A.D.C. [Aide-de-Camp] but did not take them:  a healthy fellow has no right in England, not doing A.W.C.</p>
