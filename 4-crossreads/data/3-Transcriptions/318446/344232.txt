<p>2nd Feb.<br/>El Arish<br/>The Turkish 'planes came over the other morning when it was very misty &amp; dropped about 10 bombs &ndash; two in the sea.<br/>On clear days they usually come over but are kept at a distance by our A.A. guns.  I got a fright last night, I had just blown out the light &amp; turned over when I thought I heard a 'plane coming.  I heard it for about 5 mins. but did not like to say anything for fear that I had what is known here as taubitis.<br/>Finally it became unmistakeable &amp; turned out to be one of ours.  Tonight I have got nerves badly as it is a brilliant moonlight night, the moon is practically overhead &amp; altogether an ideal night for them &amp; we were over there last</p>
