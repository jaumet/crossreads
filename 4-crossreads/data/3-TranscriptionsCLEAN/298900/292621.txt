class haircut & shave.  Had tea at the soldiers institute.   Met Major Beard just returned from leave by accident so brought him back with us.   Arrived home about 7 P.M. & packed up my kit etc ready for marching out as we were timed to start at 2.15 A.M.    Turned in at 9 P.M. to be called at 1 A.M.    Paid for my billet before turning in & consider that the majority of people in this village are an avaricious, grasping lot.   Besides what we pay for our billets they collect from the British Government and the slightest thing they can claim as damaged is also paid for by the same good Samaritan.   I really believe if the wind blew a fence down the people would put a claim in against the British Government.   Lovely weather.
Tuesday 29th Jan     Reveille at 1 A.M.    Had breakfast at 1.30 and marched out at 2.30 A.M. the lads all singing in great spirits.   Reached Samer in about 2 hours
