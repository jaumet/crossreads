At marquees 10 in each and am to be in charge of the lot with only me staff nurse & orderlies 1 to each ward. Much love again - I need not tell you anything about the conditions cos Mrs Dick will tell you everything. It's a scandal taking her from us & Mrs Morton. She has been nursing all the sick sisters and caring for us & fighting our food battles etc.We will miss them terribly. They have been wonderfully good to us & put up with all our trials & privations with great heart.Betha
