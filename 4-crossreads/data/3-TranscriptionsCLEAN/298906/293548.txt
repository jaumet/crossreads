  
 chased him a couple of hours & then lost him, this afternoon he was up before the Colonel & he gave him a DC.M, this is what always seems ridiculous to me they will go & punish a good man for the sake of wasters, & in 9 cases out of 10, the good man is spoilt for good, I know if I got in to trouble over a case like this & it wasn't my fault & they punished me, I would never soldier again, & practically all are of the same opinion on this point. Brought all our reinforcements up tonight & have got them told off in the platoons & huts. The days are getting noticeably shorter now, & are drawing in rapidly & I am not sorry for it will give us a chance to sleep
