<p>In a little village called Figheldean (and by the locals Fiddle-de-de) is a large chestnut tree and underneath is a blacksmith's shop.<br/>This is supposed to be the original of the Longfellow's poem, "Under a Spreading chestnut tree" and certainly it looks the part.<br/>Aeroplanes are as common a sight here as motor cars over our way.  It is nothing to se 3 or 4 fluttering over our heads at once.</p>
