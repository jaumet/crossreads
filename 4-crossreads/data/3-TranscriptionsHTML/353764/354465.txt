There are the Artillery Heavy Howitzers, Trench Mortars &amp; a continuous rattle of Machine Guns.<br/>We are Transporting hard out to Rail Head, from where it is taken on by Camel Trains.  We are raking up every kind of tin imaginable to hold water for the Troops.<br/>Am going to ride down to the Canal &amp; have a swim directly &amp; I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p>13/5/16 Saturday<br/>I had a rough trip last night.  I went out with 20 x 4 Horse Teams to move Wagons from Ordnance to Serapeum No 2.  The Heat nearly sent us mad but we had to stick it out.  I finally finished the job just 3 minutes too late to cross the Bridge, &amp; had to wait an hour &amp; &frac34;  for a punt to take the Horses across, &amp; then I had to cut the column in 4 to get them across.  I arrived back safely had some Tea &amp; went straight to Bed.</p>
