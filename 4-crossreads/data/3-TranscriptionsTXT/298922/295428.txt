 Thursday 12 April 1917 
 At Outpost tonight &ndash; enemy 6 planes bombed our Aerodrome. Our Machines flew out like a lot of scalded ants if you poured hot water into the nest. We have not got the best machines out here I'm afraid. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  Got some silk soks from Col. now General Meredith's daughter. General Cox is now our Brigadier. J.B. Meredith has the 4 L.H. Brigade. 
 Found a snake in our trench, scorpions are plentiful among the old Roman antiquities. Our Adjutant brought me a collection of wildflowers he had gathered. There are many different sorts.
