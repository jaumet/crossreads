<p>Monday 11 June 1917</p>
<p>Here's one &ndash; a subaltern of the 7 L.H. wanted to buy some fowls from Bedouin &ndash; unable to talk clapped his arms &amp; crowed. MEN on return to Camp would flap arms &amp; crow whenever he came into lines (not being too popular). Later a Patrol brought in a Rooster &amp; kept him alive till next day. Rooster crowed at dawn, shout from dug-out "STOP that row". Again Cock crowed "STOP that row" from the 1 dug-out. Then one of the Stable Picket rushed at the rooster with Bayonet saying "I'll cut your b- head off if you crow again" don't you hear the Officers order!!  The men are great wags &amp; generally score.</p>
