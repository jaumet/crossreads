In front of us were three warships the first reminders of war we had had since leaving Freemantle, and just to the right in the distance one could discern the town of Suez shrouded in an early morning mist. Soon, however, a fiery ball began to creep up over those bare sand hills giving everything a reddish glow and soon the curtain of dawn was swept away and we could see the entrance to the Canal and the town quite clearly.
