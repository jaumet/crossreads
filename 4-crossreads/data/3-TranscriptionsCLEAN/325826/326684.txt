Box Hill  15.7.15R 16.7.15P.S. Tell Wal when you see him please that I got a nice little spoon & fork set with my initials on it.   (Initials)My dear Father & Mother,I have not yet had to say good-by to my dear husband & we have still to-day.  We have found quite a lot of shopping & things to fix up in Melbourne & it is indeed a good thing that the boat was postponed.  We are going to have a few hours together in the gardens this afternoon & let everything else go.      I had a few lines from Emily this morning & she told me that you had rung up, Father, & were a bit better.  I was so very glad to hear it.     It is bitterly cold on the hands & feet here, one could almost cry out with the pain of it, & that is why my writing is so laboured.Rid has to be on board about noon to-morrow but when the boat sails we do not know.  I can't make up my mind yet how soon I will return, I am anxious to do so & yet dread it.Love to the boys & An & to your dear selves.Ollie.
