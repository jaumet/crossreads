 Got up early and went to Fountainbleau with YMCA Party. It is situated about forty miles from Paris and it is here that the famous Forest of Fountainbleau is. We spent a very pleasant hour in the quaint town. Had lunch in the Hotel Cadian. Had we not seen the Palace of Versailles we would have considered the Palace of Fountainbleau magnificent  Still it was a most beautiful place inside and contained beautiful rooms and beautiful pictures. The Palace dates back before Napoleon's time but its history is interwoven with the life of Napoleon. It is useless for me even to attempt to describe these places, they have got to be seen in order to be fully appreciated 
 We drove through the magnificent Forest of Fountainbleau in a Char-a-banc. The day was pretty hot and the cool drive in the shade of the trees was delightful. We had our Photos taken with the Maid of the Forest. This "Maid of the Forest" had a caf&eacute; near the Swinging Rock and she gave us an exhibition of shaking this rock. I could not move the stone but she, being as the saying is "like the end of a house" I would much rather have her standing on the top of the huge Swinging Rock than standing on the top of me  We returned to Paris at 6.p.m.
