Arrived at Steinbecque 4 AM, where we disentrained after a 58 hour train journey. Marched into village of Morbecque where we were billeted in huts (canvas) erected for the purpose. Whole of the country en-route, beautiful, people out in every town to welcome us. Now within hearing of the guns at La Bassee. Granted two hours leave during afternoon; walked a couple of miles into town of Hazebrouck; while there went into cathedral had a look around, very fine building. Fine church in practically every village. Rained very heavily during night; sheds we are at present in leak very badly, had an uncomfortable time for a few
