<p>14/3/18  La Basse Ville</p>
<p>Now on to No. 8* and while there got a few flicks of m.g. bullets that sent us close to the earth. Main guided us to no. 9 where things were rather miserable owing to the rain. The Boche evidently spied our wiring party out in front because he worked flare and m.g. together and sent his bullets kicking up the mud. Leaving here we followed the old torn up railway line right back to our trenches. It is all torn up and we had some terrible tumbles. Once, flattened in the mud to avoid m.g. fire, I got a kick in the face from someone in front. Called at D Co and then made direct back for the Batt H.Q.</p>
