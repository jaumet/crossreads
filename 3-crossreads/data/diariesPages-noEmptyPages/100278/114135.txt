16th Today is a beauty nice and sunny with never a cloud to be seen, but very cold, gives one a good appetite. 
Len has taken no 11 platoon away today on baggage guard so that means that we will be shifting tomorrow I expect. There was an issue of sheepskin gloves and socks this evening. 
17th Went to the pictures again last night missed the first sitting and had to wait for 2 hours in a long queque. This morning we packed up again and moved off again in motor cars.
