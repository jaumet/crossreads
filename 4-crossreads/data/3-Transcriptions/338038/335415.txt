<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>Since writing you from Exeter last week I have done a fair amount of travelling &ndash; My friend Read &amp; I left for Edinburgh on the night of the 2nd and had the 3rd &amp; 4th &amp; part of the 5th there, leaving for here midday yesterday &ndash; We had a wonderful time in Edinburgh &amp; think a great deal of it as a City.</p>
