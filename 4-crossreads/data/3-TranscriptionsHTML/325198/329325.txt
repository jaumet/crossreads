<p>30 June, 1916<br/>Katia<br/>When we left Etmaler this morning the whole desert was wrapt in a curtain of fog,  When some times we climbed on to the top of a sand hill we could see it stretching around us like a huge mosquito net;  The air was damp &amp; our clothes got quite wet  Travelling was difficult &amp; it took us a long time to get a proper move on  We got to Katia shortly after daylight &amp; made tea for breakfast  We will stay here all day I think &amp; will leave about 12 oclock to night.  The mare is fit she has eaten all the feed I brought  for her &amp; is now on some bakseech - Im glad she is eating well some of the horses are a bit crook &amp; off their feed already dont know what they will feel like to morrow after going all night.  My hands are sore the flies have got to a couple of places where I had bark knocked of &amp; they are septic,  Dont feel too good any way. The palms here are loaded with dates, I wonder if we will be here when they are ripe.  My mare has taken a fancy to them &amp; every green date that drops near her she snaps up.</p>
