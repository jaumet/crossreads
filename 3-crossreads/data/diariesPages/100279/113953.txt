I am writing tonight in a nice comfortable room belonging to the French people where we are billeted, there is a nice fire going in the room we have chairs lamps a table everything is nice cosy outside it is cold the hail is falling thick heavy, both combined makes one think of the poor devils in the trenches also of our fair far away homes, where at this present time the sun is shining it is now about 8 oclock in the evening here as there is nearly 10 hours difference in the time I guess the sun is shining alright, thats what we miss I think as much as anything the nice warm sun, we very seldom see it now when we do it is very pale sickly looking not the slightest sign of heat in it
