afternoon & I had to order the fish for dinner or breakfast tomorrow.  I got 4 lb. of plaice I like those fish very much then after this he bought a pint or two of shrimps for tea & at the same time had some to eat while walking down the street he's a proper character & cares no more for conventions than he does of a snap of the fingers, from here we went round & paid his works a visit & he showed us all his pumps engines & etc. he turns out great quantities of pumps, from the works to the office & here he had to sign a lot of papers & cheques & give some orders & then home to tea, & the rest of the evening we put in lounging in the easy chairs in front of a nice warm fire drinking good wine smoking cigars & eating fruit & yarning till tea time.  We had a bonzer bed & both slept till fairly late in the morning.
