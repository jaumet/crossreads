 That night we went to a concert given by the Pierrotts Concert Coy in an old shed, but in the middle of the performance an air raid took place and as usual the show ended and we went back to our dugout. 
 On 5th September we left our dugouts and started marching to the front line, as we were to hop over the following morning.  We got into position at midnight and lay out on the grass all night.  The Germans were now retreating, leaving machine gunners in strong positions to harry us and give us trouble as their infantry retired.  Also of course their artillery was giving us a bad time as it also retreated.  The Germans were now well on the run.  At daylight we started to advance without any barrage from our artillery and the German machine gunners gave us a hot time but there weren't many troops in front of us to impede our progress.  I never remember hearing so many machine gun bullets whizzing about before.  Of course not having any noise from our artillery seemed to magnify the noise form the machine guns.  We had very many narrow escapes but only lost a few killed and wounded.  My pal (Bob Ward) had his steel helmet knocked off by a machine gun bullet, but escaped injury.  He has his steel hat, with the dent in it plainly shewing, hanging up in his home in Brisbane.  By twelve o'clock we had advanced 2,000 yards and then dug in.  At three o'clock we got the order to advance and we pushed through the village of Tincourt, which was in flames &ndash; the Germans having set it on fire before retreating.  We established ourselves in temporary trenches in front of the burning village.  A few of the enemy, who were hidden in dugouts, came and surrendered themselves to us.  They were starving and ate ravenously of the food we gave them.  Their clothes were in rags and their boots worn out &ndash; no soles &amp;c in them &ndash; and they were also very dejected and downhearted.  They knew that they were losing the war.  What a contrast to our troops. We were well clothed, well fed and full of optimism as to the result of the war. 
 The next morning we were relieved and marched back to the reserve line.  That night we were heavily shelled with gas shells and had to don our gas masks. 
 The next day we marched back to the line near Tincourt and I had an opportunity of exploring the ruins of the town.  We were warned against German treachery when inspecting a village that had been evactuated by the Germans, but not much of Tincourt was left standing, nearly all of it having been burned. 
 We weren't allowed to take water from the wells until the Army Medical Corps had tested it and pronounced it fit for drinking (as very often the Germans poisoned the wells before retreating).  Once when some of our men were drawing up a bucket of water from a well in the captured village of Suzanne, an explosion occurred, but luckily no one was killed.  The Germans had a mine hidden in the well.  When opening the doors of houses very often explosions occurred as the enemy had contrivances fixed so that the opening of a door or the moving of anything would explode a hidden bomb.  Also near Peronne when some of our men went to bury the dead after the Battle of Mont St Quentin (which I was not in) when they were
