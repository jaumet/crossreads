 Jarman              ( cheerfully       jobs  & like them 
 Francis worked                            contented Poor Hunter is continually dodging his work to speak to me.  He simply hates his job. Had no initiation on board. 
 Heard that we may expect to leave for front in a very short time now.  Sooner the better. 
 Relieved Hunter for hour & half in evening & couldn't say I was impressed by the work.
