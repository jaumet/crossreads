17th. Travelled all night long in freezing carriages crowded. I slept on the rack as one could get a stretch there, it was still snowing when we reached Bologne we hopped off here went across, Tom Flattley I had some breakfast then we walked down to another station caught the Northbound train for soldiers, she was a cold ride in cattle trucks to Hazelbrouch where we got off again caught a train going to Baileul where they reckoned we would find our units, Tom I pooled our cash had some tea before setting out on our hunt, oh its nice coming home from your leave, you don't give a cuss how things go you are fed up with everything
18th After a long hunt I found the Battn last night, they having moved from down below, I can tell you I was pleased to catch them up, soon I was sitting beside a roaring fire having a good feed relating some of my Paris experiences to the boys it was quite late when we went to bed
