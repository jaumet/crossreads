<p>deal to do 12 miles with full pack &amp; rifle on but it is easy enough to do when one gets a bit fit.  When doing a big march the chief strain comes on the feet &amp; sometimes on the muscles of the legs, one good thing the roads are all very good about here.  I have just nocks off this letter to have a feed of steak &amp; onions which we get at the canteen &amp; we enjoy it properly too as we get so little meat during the day.  I have been stony broke this week on account of having to send some money away for photos but as Ken has a few bob I have been able to get my nightly supper.  I have about &pound;8 due to me in my pay book but can't get it as they wont pay us more than 30/- per fortnight but if we get any more leave we will have something to fall back on.  You had better</p>
