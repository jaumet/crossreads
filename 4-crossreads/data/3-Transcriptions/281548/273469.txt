<p>The harsh conditions imposed upon us by our German taskmasters in their haste to forge this link in the chain of communication between the Mesopotamia &amp; Palestine fighting-fronts &amp; their bases of supply, the time taken in the preparation &amp; execution of my two attempts to escape &amp; my many visits to Hospital, due to attacks of the Fever which was ever-present in Turkish prisoner-of-war camps; all these things hampered me in my attempt to keep a diary.<br/>However I managed to keep two notebooks, in which I jotted down the most important details of my sojourn in Anatolia, &amp; with the aid of "Memory's Diary" where the writing is not blurred but very distinct, I am able to fill in the gaps.<br/>The interest evinced, by friends &amp; strangers alike, since my return, &amp; the constantly recurring questions, suggested to me that this narrative might have a wider interest.  Hence this book.</p>
