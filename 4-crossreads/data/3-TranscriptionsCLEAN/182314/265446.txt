 To The O.C. "C" Coy 
 from Captain [P.J. Murphy?] 
  Report on N.C.O.'s of No 12 platoon.  
 Sir. 
 In accordance with your instructions and acting in consultation with Platoon Serg t.  Norris, in the absence of L t.  Shaw, I beg to submit my report on the N.C.O.s of No 12 platoon 
 X  Platoon Serg t.  Norris  
 An ideal platoon sergeant. Perfect control, smart & reliable always. In any ticklish job, I would recommend him in the certainty that it would be carried out as well as any N.C.O. could do it. 
 X  Sgt M c. Clure  
 A good reliable man. Lacks dash and initiative. If  asked  told to carry out a job requires too many particulars, as to how it should be done. Health not too good, would never recommend him to act as platoon Sergt.
