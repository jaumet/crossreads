Last night coming home from the trenches I took my boots off & walked the boards in my socks.Had a good long sleep during the day & just at tea time Mr. Page came round with an order that we were to proceed to the firing line at once & had to be at Rexham Rd at 6.15 that left us 1/2 an hour to have tea, pack, & push off in,  after reaching the firing line put my "reliefs" on. I then took "the watch" till 9. & nothing happened during the night. The majority of the men come off at day-light for they are too exposed.31st  What do you think of this  our sentries & the Germans exchange greetings any time of the day, we are both in full view of one another & it seems to be a mutual agreement for neither sides to shoot, we are only 60 or 70 yds away, & you can go out any
