 15/10/16 . An earli start , did a god 12 mile and billet near the villag of Aneek . Pass a veri picturesqu villag today , quit the prettiest I have ever seen call Cassel . It is perch high on a hill ; and it quaint red roof and tower make it look like the colour pictur of fairi citi . Besid it is the ruin of a grand old castl . Its great thick wall still stand , and it tower cover with ivi . A veri charm countri altogeth . Passed the even in town , a veri good place for tucker , and other comfort ; a pleasant day ! A pleasant world ! Return to camp and got a new blanket ; have two now ; am go to doss on the grass tonight .
