 First of all we gaze on the Pyramid of Cheop the largest of the 6 , which rear it head up toward 21 . March 1918 the sky for 400 feet . There are 5 other Pyramid of various size , and then the other wonder , the Sphinx . This must have been a veri beauti piec of work when it was first erect , as it still show sign of it , but a few odd thousand year will make a differ to anyth . The Arab also took us into sever tomb of ancient Egyptian King , and their wive and daughter . The carv on them was most interest and the guid pitch a yarn about each of them . One thing I notic in particular was that when give us the histori of the various Royal Famili . He would say this is King so and so and his wife and his daughter but no mention of the Wive or daughter name , so evid women folk did n't count for much in those day , but what a differ now . We also visit the templ of the Sphins and Campbel 's tomb . This tomb is the burial place of some great Egyptian princess , and was excav by Col . Campbel , whom it is name after . Her coffin can be plain seen . It is carv out of a solid block of blue marbl . After see all this we paid off our guid 15 disast ( 5d each ) and took a P.Ts . worth of tram ride to the Zoo . This is a fine place . There is a good collect of bird and anim , and the garden are beauti . We ran into a parti of Egyptian kiddi and they were veri interest in Billey gold tooth . I took a snapshot of them and Stan Wright took anoth , and I promis to send the teacher a pictur , if they turn out good .
