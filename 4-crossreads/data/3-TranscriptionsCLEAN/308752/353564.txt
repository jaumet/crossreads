  
 we board the car, & enjoyed a delightful spin for about two hours. The distance was about 40 miles, so you can imagine that on our arrival at the town we were feeling rather hungry. There is nothing like a motor trip in the early morning to give one an appetite.  Breakfast at some flash hotel, & then we strolled around the city, enjoyed walking in to different shops making little purchases, visited the photographers & the Y.M.C.A. At the latter I had a good game of billiards, the first game I have had since I left Australia. After dinner we strolled along to the third A.G.H. & arrived there just as a cricket match between the Hospital Staff & the team from our Unit was to begin.  Our team was beaten by 15 runs, not a great victory when one considers that the hospital team are continually playing & have a good wicket.  I met quite a crowd of friends at the hospital, a fair number of our Unit had obtained transfers down there, & it was like old times seeing them again. Invited to tea with the cricketers, & not being bashful I accepted the invitation. The match was continued after tea, & at times it was rather exciting. Supper was provided for the visitors, so once again I butted my frame in. Luckily the three of us obtained a seat in the lorry which had been ordered to convey the cricketers back to our Headquarters. The crowd in the lorry had a good time going home, singing choruses, & yelling out to anyone we passed. It was close on midnight before we arrived home again. I thoroughly enjoyed the day's outing, it was the best day I have had since my Paris Leave.
