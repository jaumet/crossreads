 7/3/218 Bailleul and pick up my hors at Hotel de Faucon but did not see the groom . Made for the Officer Club which is a good place and doe you well . Had a haircut shave here and then found Murphi my groom . Return to the Club where there seem to be a rather will cliqu of potter up who were inclin to get noisi and make a good deal of row . The old squar tower of the hotel de Yiel and the squar turret of St Vaast are distinct Flemish and in a shop up the street . I heard the Flemish patoi be spoken . Dine veri well at the Club and at 8 pm left there with Murphi for Warrington Line . An amus kid to talk to is Murphi full of gossip yarn .
