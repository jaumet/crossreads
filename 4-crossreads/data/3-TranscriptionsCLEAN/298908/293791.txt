  
 10th.  A batch of 60 odd men left No. 10 Camp this morning for Devonport, that's the first batch from round this part of the world. Went down to the pictures at Sutton Veney this evening time hangs heavily on our hands here, & a fellow has to do something I reckon this is the sort of place where they should start this educational scheme that the Army has been promised it would be a regular Godsend to a lot of men. Have had another trip to the dentists this afternoon & I'm hanged if he didn't pull out the fillings of one of my front teeth.  This makes the 3rd time this has been done in this Camp, each dentist that I go to has a cut at it. 
 11th.  A few more men were sent from here today on Aussie leave I wish my turn would come quickly. Got a few letters from home & etc. this afternoon most of them dated August or thereabouts.
