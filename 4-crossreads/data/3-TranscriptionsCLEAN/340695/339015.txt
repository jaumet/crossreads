  
 it was a cold trip I nearly froze. We passed through Amiens & Albert & eventually arrived at PERONNE our destination. We all managed to squeeze into a hut but put in a very cold night the ground was quite damp. Everything was frozen next morning & we had a little trouble in obtaining a snack. It was about 11 o'c when we arrived & we stayed there all next day & night & following day until midday then we were conveyed here the coldest spot I think on Mother Earth. All are in huts we are fairly comfortable with a stove but the icy wind from the north blows through the cracks. Messing arrangements are good we mess with D.H.Q. clerks 17.12.17. Snowed to-day for the first
