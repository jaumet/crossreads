<p>15526 Pte Vick<br/>France<br/>1/7/18<br/>My Dear Sis,<br/>Many thanks for parcel which I received yesterday. Have not finished the cigars yet or read all the papers. The cigars are just lovely. I met Fred Gale again. I do not know that you know him but he remembers you very well from playing at the town dances. Anyway I strolled up to see him with some cigars in my pocket  &amp; as soon as I crawled into his "bivvy" he brought a big birthday cake to light. We then went into a village for some champagne but could only get red wine "Vin rouge". Anyway we had quite a little birthday party wine, cake &amp; cigars. He wishes to be remembered to you &amp; also will give Vol his vote if the elections come off. Also received a parcel from the Blacktown Juvenile Knitting Club so I am not doing too badly.
