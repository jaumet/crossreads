<p>a new idea &amp; a good one as his duty is to see if there are any drugs lying idle &amp; if so to take them back.<br/>Had a visit from a man named Ede who enlisted with me in 1914.</p>
<p>Dimanche 19 Mai<br/>Collected drugs from Crouy,[?] a very warm &amp; dusty trip yet withal pleasant.<br/>Had a little excitement last night about midnight.  Fritz had been putting a few shells over very close to us during the evening &amp; About 12, landed one about 50 yds away right alongside the officers mess, killing a tommy who was seeking shelter behind a wall.  It was an extraordinary burst, throwing the man <strike>away</strike> 20 yds away &amp; a huge stone weighing 98 lbs right over a large 3 storey building to crash through a roof &amp; fall between 2 men who were sleeping on the floor, one of the men receiving only a superficial graze, an extraordinary escape.<br/>A gas alarm was also given but that was unnecessary &amp; I only lost about &frac12; hours</p>
