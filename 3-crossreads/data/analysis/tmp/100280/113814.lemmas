 It has been a glorious day again the artilleri has been veri activ , we halt quit close some of our 9.2 it was veri interest to watch to watch them lift up their black snout spit for the fire flame steel see them jump back on their recoil spring , then the gunner jump to the gun attend to her want . After we settl down Judd I went look for a canteen to see if we could buy anyth for tea , but we had veri littl luck for they were all sold out
