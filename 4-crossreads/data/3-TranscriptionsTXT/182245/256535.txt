 Fine &amp; cool wind blowing. Fixing 
 up horselines, harness hooks ect 
 &amp; exercising horses in the morning 
 &amp; cleaning harness in afternoon. 
 They are having one section 
 on duty per day to take up 
 amunition ect so we will 
 only be going up one day in 
 three. There was a good bit 
 of firing done during the day 
 but no shells came near us.
