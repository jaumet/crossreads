Turksshelled our rail head with big guns this morning - but we are camped a little back. We can bathe but are warned that sharks & mines are on the beach!!  Comforting.
Parcel of Plum Duff Lanoline Shaving Soap Sweets all arrived safely. Never send CHEESE. We get it issued like Oil in the heat - and Tinned Milk is not worth sending. All the above many thanks. I am being very well treated.
[The following crossed through.]  Am glad JOE had some good fishing at King on Hopkins, some day I hope we may go there together.
