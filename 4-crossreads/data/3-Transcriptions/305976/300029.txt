<p>Saturday July 27<br/>Grapes &amp; Melons are plentiful just at present. The fruit is very welcome after our long spell in the Jordan valley.<br/>Sunday July 28<br/>Rode to Jaffa today. Jaffa much altered since I was last there. The town has developed &amp; business is in full swing. We had a dip in the surf also giving our horses a swim.<br/>Monday July 29<br/>Took a trip to Richon to day. One of the prettiest little villages I have seen. The Jews seem well contented &amp; prosperous.</p>
