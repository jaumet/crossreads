What do you think of an Aroid? The arum lily is the type - 12 feet & more in height with leaves feet long & a stalk a yard round  -  Alocaria indica - growing in swampland  -  Then I found out a lot about Sandal wood  -  That wood brought the first traders to Fiji  -  Sandal wood & idolatory are as old as mankind  -  The Alung tree of Solomon's day was probably sandal wood  -  Joss sticks are sandal wood sawdust stuck in sand & lit & the sweet savor soothes the god whose earthen (wooden) form sits in unmoveable calm in front of his favorite scent - sandal wood incense & the scent of the wood & oil is linked up to sensuality in Hindoo & Buddhist in India & China  -  The passions of man & woman are reflected in the Godhood & the revel of the senses in odor & sweet perfumes links manhood, womanhood & Godhead  -
