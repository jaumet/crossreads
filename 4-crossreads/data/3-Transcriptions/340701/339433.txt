<p>Saturday 4-11-16<br/>Working in Roads.  Picking up Bricks.</p>
<p>Sunday 5-11-16<br/>Cleaning &amp; draining Fish trench.  Heavy Bombardment today.  Can see the Housetops of Bapaume in the distance 2&frac12; miles or 3 away.</p>
<p>Monday 6-11-16<br/>I believe out fellows captured two lines of trenches yesterday.  Fritz put 3 shells into a few yds of fish trench yesterday of course he sent others but none so close.  We did'nt go out this morning.. The 17th  were working on the Roads yesterday.  There was a wild rumor that some of them gave themselves up a few days ago.  We have had 2 days fine weather, very cold &amp; strong Breeze.  Our Aeroplanes seem to go up in any Breeze or wind.  Walked about 1/2 mile to see a tank yesterday.</p>
<p>Wednesday 8-11-16<br/>Had a very wet cold day yesterday, mud to the neck.  Also got a cold.  Weather conditions awfull.</p>
<p>Thursday  9-11-16<br/>After making dugouts all day we got 5 minutes notice yesterday to have our Tea 3.30 P.M. and go out to Flers on a night Tramway job.  My Boots like those of 70&percnt; of the Battalion are in pieces, my Heel is badly Skinned &amp; yesterday settled the contract.  I paraded</p>
<p>[See page 109 for the image of the following page]<br/>sick &amp; had my foot dressed.  But that can be of very little use untill I get new Boots.  Taubes bombed the camp for the second time within a week the night before last.  After we returned from Flers last night we found that Fritz had put a 8" adjacent.  when the First Taube came over one of his Bombs splathered our dug out with mud the same has happened with one or two of the shells.</p>
<p>10-11-16<br/>No duty yesterday. Sore Heel.  Taubes came over again last night.  Boys working out at Flers on Tram line last night.  Very cold &amp; foggy today.  Our boys &amp; the Germans on their respective front lines are up to their waist in mud &amp; stand miserably looking at one another.  There is no rifle fire.  Some of the men are so weak &amp; get bogged so deep coming out that the Artillery men put ropes &amp; things on their horses &amp; pulled them out that way.  The horses are having a terrible time.</p>
<p>Saturday 11-11-16<br/>Light duty yesterday.  Wood &amp; water jocy.  Taube over again last night with incendiary Bombs.  They are getting very cheeky.  I heard that our Anti guns got 3 yesterday but only seen one come down with a wing shot off.  Fritz is putting plenty of "Duds" about the camp.  He shelled the Boys on the Flers</p>
