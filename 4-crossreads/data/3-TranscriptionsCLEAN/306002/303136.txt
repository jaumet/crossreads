  
 9.5.15 him off.  I fell to sleep soon after the train started & did not wake till sunrise.  We arrived at Alexandria about noon;  had a dip alongside the wharf, then changed the few piastres I had into English money, bought a couple of cups of tea & cake from the Y.W.C.A. which is on the wharf, & very good & cheap & then we were marched on to the boat, after having our leggings taken away & given infantry pants & putties in place of them.  The ship moved away from the wharf at 7 oclock & I have never seen a happier crew.
