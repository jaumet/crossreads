 La . DIDDIE&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp; um 
 &nbsp; 
 Maud De Vere behind the bar 
 Thought she like to be a star 
 She did a turn somewhere in France 
 But the first time that she tried to dance 
 La&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; um 
 -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; - 
 She fell - &amp; broke her contract. 
 &nbsp; 
  Private Smith of the A.I.F  
  Pretended to be very deaf  
 Private Smith of the A.I.F 
 Alas, he was so very deaf 
 The doctors he had beaten off 
 Til at last he bumped old 
 Major toff 
 He fell &amp; came a gutser 
  And so he came a gutser
