poor Bill Carey had been killed he used to belong to our old Company H, the night of the charge at Pozeries, he left the Pioneer Battalion, joined in the charge with us, the day after we went out he was skittled.
This afternoon we were out on a route march with full packs up it is punishment for the number of drunks that have been about to punish the few, they punish the whole lot; thats a bad point I reckon in the military, to make the many suffer for the few but they did not take us far, we marched without Tunics, so we were not so badly off
