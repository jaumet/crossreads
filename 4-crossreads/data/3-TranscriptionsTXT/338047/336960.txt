1919MarchIt was then 8 pm by their clock, as they did not take any notice of the daylight saving stunt.  Old Jules would grunt "Bon soir" at us & his big dog Blak would grunt, & that would be all of his conversation.  Once he opened up & told me about the pigs he found in the trees in the forest.  (I think he was trying to be funny).  We showed the girls several different games of "patience".  Faddy would go outside & come in with some conjuring tricks with saucers, tumblers etc.  They called him "le sorcier" for a while, but after he appeared one night half inked, & apologised (or rather, got me to do it for him) next day, his name was changed to "le penitent".  I was called "le vicaire".  Sgt Shepherd (who occasionally came in) "le cure" - why I don't know.  Their fiances used to toddle in at times & glare at us but the girls did not seem to care whether they came or not.  They used to like to hear us sing so we would regale them with, Waltzing Matilda,
