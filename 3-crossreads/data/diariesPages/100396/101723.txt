Dear Chas,
I often wonder how you are doing. When I last heard of you: you were at Inglewood working I presume. I had a letter from mother the other day. also one from Ino written before I left Melbourne. I expect there are a few more for me somewhere or other.
I suppose the price of skins has not improved any yet. if you should think fit to dispose of them do so stick to the brass, I don't suppose I will want any for sometime to come. at present I am stony broke, but this is a common thing in a military camp. pay day will come round in a day or two. everything is counted in piastres here about 5 go to a shilling. at first one gets the idea he is only spending pennies. instead of 2  and so the cash flies. We arrived at the land of the Pharoahs on the first, after a splendid trip, spoilt only by 7 of our chaps kicking the bucket. pneumonia being the cause.
