 This side of the Wardan railway in years gone by had been cultivated  a little but the Desert has triumphed in the end & covered everything  even the railway has to be protected by fencing  Further out on the Desert the going is hard & the surface covered with small stones but transport once off the road has to be done by Camels Roads are made by laying Bulrushes & reeds from the Nile first then manure and rubbish - better roads are macadamised but the stone has to be railed a long way & then per camel.  We hear that the 3rd Regiment has had a bit of a scrap with the Bedouins, but news is unreliable-
