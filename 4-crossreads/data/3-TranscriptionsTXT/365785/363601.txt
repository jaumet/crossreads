War NotesLull in Military Operations
The communiques appearing this morning reveal a general lull in military operations on practically all fronts.  Russia has nothing to add to the minor moves reported from Galicia, Western Armenia, and Western Persia during the week-end.  Italy has apparently settled down again for the time being, after her brief but effective attack on the Asiago Plateau.  Apparently we cannot expect to hear much from Mesopotamia and Palestine at present, and if General Sarrail has any offensive plans for this year in Macedonia they will probably depend upon the future actions of the Russo-Roumanian armies to the northward.  On the Western front the British have only been concerned with raids and aerial combats.  The French, however, claim to have recaptured the greater portion of the salient which the enemy drove into their line during his recent severe attacks near Vauxaillon, south-west of Laon.  The heavy bombardments farther eastward along the heights above the Aisne suggest that the French have not yet experienced the last of these attacks to which their line in this region has recently been subject.  One item of news from the Western front this morning which should be noted is the appearance right up near the extreme left of the Allied [line ?] of British troops.  We are not told the strength of these troops who have appeared amongst the sand dunes above Nieuport, but it is possible that their presence might account for the artillery bombardment reported on this sector recently.
Intrigues and Plots.
To-day's cabled messages contain some unquestionable proofs of the extent to which the Central Powers rely upon intrigues and plots in connection with the conduct of the war.  The particulars regarding the Gerlach case, although reminiscent of sensational fiction, reveal an Austrian plot of the type which we might reasonably expect one belligerent to institute against another in time of war.  Distasteful as the work of spying must appear to all civilised peoples, it is nevertheless a necessary evil in time of war.  This being the case, it is not difficult to understand Austria's desire to learn the Italian military secrets, or her alacrity to take advantage of the methods employed in obtaining those secrets.  Spying and plotting are by no means confined to Austria, but in most civilised countries there is a recognised limit to the work of secret agents.  Germany admits of no such limit, and the intrigues and plots which she fomented in the United States long before President Wilson had even hinted at a break with Germany, showed that she was prepared to use against a neutral the same weapons which she would apply to an enemy.  The latest disclosure of her extensive plots against Norway is another instance of her absolute contempt for neutrals.  We have long ceased to wonder at her total disregard for
