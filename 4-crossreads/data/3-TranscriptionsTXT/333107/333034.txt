 Frid. May 3 The doctors took about a quart of Fluid from one of our chaps this morning. He seems to be pretty bad. 
 The doctor says he will fill in my Board Papers tomorrow. I commenced Letter 18 to M.S. and told her all about it. Perhaps I was wrong in doing so, as I am a long way from Home yet, and she will be awfully disappointed if the Board happens to fail. Gee! but I hope not. The very idea of being  Home  again makes me feel about 10 years younger. Anyhow I'm going to hope for the Best. 
 Bill Beards and Mic Lean came to see me. They were going on Leave. 
 No mail for me yet. 
 Sat. 4 The doctor said he would make out my Board papers today but he must have forgotten. 
 George Lawson came to see me and brought some Cigarettes. A Lady came round just before Tea and said "did we mind her leaving us a few eggs". Of course we said wib be delightful; and Eggs figured on our menu for Tea. 
 Wrote Letter 19.  Sun. 5 Corp. Carr came to see me today and promised to send some Jam and other good things. Food is not of the Best in this Hospital and a bit of a change will be welcome.
