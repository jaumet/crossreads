 I have received lots of papers from you from time to time, &amp; appreciate them very much indeed. It's a good idea to just cut out the interesting parts &amp; leave out the ads &ndash; saves a lot of weight. Read all about Anzac Day, but it was a shame it was marred by so much bickering &amp; letter writing, as to how to celebrate it &ndash; and not always in the politest of words either. 
 Glad you liked the photos, and only wish I had the camera here now. Could get some of the "dinkum" pictures, but no hope in life! Did you ever get that tin of negatives &amp; coins I sent home? I think I can get the address of the lad who took them, so if I do I will send it along &amp; you can drop him a note, enquiring. I don't think he'd pinch them, but he may have lost the address. 
 So long for the present, and don't worry. I'm OK. &amp; feeling good. Heaps of love to you all. 
 Your Son Alan 
 My address just the same as before.
