I have not had much time to go and see these places, for though we have not so much to do.   There are various things that keep us from getting far afield, and then we are not supposed to leave this village, if we are here next week I am going to try and find Jack his unit is camped about 6 miles from here I believe I have not heard from him for a long time but he was doing well in April.   I told Mother in one of my letters that I had met one of willies mates who spoke very highly of him.    I came down here under Some Tall Poplar trees to write soon after dinner, but, went to sleep instead   They are very pretty trees not the Tall Slender poplars that grow in Aus. but fine large trees with spreading branches.   They have been planted in long rows along the Ancre and look like big avenues.   There are other trees here and there amongst them elms, a beech tree here and there and willows, the latter are not allowed to grow
