<p>January, 1915<br/>Sunday 17<br/>I shall not become too soft I have my [indecipherable] Uniform C/- under my bed, to sleep on, but all hands are getting very fat. A detonator, dynamite, &amp; fuse were found in the Chart room ere we sailed, some kind German friend no doubt.<br/>Vaccinated for Small Pox today &amp; Church parade. "Skippers" I find are very human &ndash; We passed the "Port Macquarie" because one could not keep her place, &amp; ever since then her Skipper has been trying to pass us again, our Engineers enjoy the sport &amp; will not give way We are supposed to keep 800 yards apart, one boat behind the other &amp; 3 columns abreast.</p>
