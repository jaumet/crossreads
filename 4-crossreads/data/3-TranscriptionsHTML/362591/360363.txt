<p>the train 48 hours after us was snowbound 17&frac12; hours, but <u>we</u> - steamed into Ottawa, nearly 3000 miles distance from Vancouver, on time!  It is by such little signs that one knows that Providence is still with us.</p>
<p>They treated us magnificently at Ottawa &ndash; made me a P.C. of Canada &ndash; an absolutely unique honour for a stranger.  I did some fairly good work in Canada in several ways.  At Washington taking Niagara &ndash; en route- I saw the British Ambassador, &amp; two of the American Cabinet Gen. Scott &amp; Lansing &amp; Roosevelt's stock is steadily rising.</p>
<p>Please God we land at Liverpool tomorrow &amp; then to see what we shall see.  I shall do my best.  I am not sanguine as to results.  The Englishman still looks out at the world through the narrow windows of his castle.  But thank God he hasn't lost his courage nor his tenacity.</p>
<p>Today we hear that there is some talk about Turkey asking for peace, or thinking about doing so.  Anyhow Russia is coming on like the wrath of God.  I <u>know</u> she will get through.
