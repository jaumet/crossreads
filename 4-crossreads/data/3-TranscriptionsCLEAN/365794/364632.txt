  
 Sunday 18 August 1918 Church 9.30 a.m., very sleepy.  Miss Cheetham gone on leave & will go to Gaza shortly.  I hope Miss G. continues to alter all arrangements as to time with off duty, etc. & 1/2 days only occur once weekly. No home letters for 3 weeks & then 2 only for me. Orderlies continue to report sick & the personnel of British & nursing staff of Aust. sisters does not seem a happy combination. Laurie Rutledge is in G.9 (unknown to me).  Sand fly fever, looks well. Mr. William Ronia in D.3, speaks to me in passing to duty 8 p.m.
