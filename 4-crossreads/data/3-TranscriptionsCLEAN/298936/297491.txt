  
 December, 1915 
 Tuesday 7 
 Still shelling. 
 Howitzer started again in the afternoon & smashed a dugout near our ward. 
 I felt pretty " perspirey" laying helpless on my back. 
 Hurried orders to send walking cases to the sap, & stand-by stretcher cases. 
 3 more shells - whistling slowly towards us - the terrible suspense! 
 Then they burst further away & all was quiet again. 
 Egyptians mistook bomb for [indecipherable] & six brought in Hospital ship.
