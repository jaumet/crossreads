1919July nights.  The whistle was kept continually booming out a warning.  I heard another boat once, answering, but the fog was too dense to see anything.  It must have been very hard work for the officers & crew keeping watch through it.  The water was fairly calm but this heavy blanket of fog made things very miserable.  No Sun - nothing to be seen, & a continual clammy feeling.
Aug 5On 5th Aug the weather became warmer & we were at last out of the fogs.  We were paid 10/- each.  There was talk of a monsoon in the Indian Ocean, so we made south to escape it.  Towards nightfall it became windy & cold.
Aug 6On 6 august it was very cold & a terrific wind was blowing coming almost head on.  From the feel of it, it seemed to blowing straight from the South Pole, bringing with it sleet & snow.  The spray from the waves was turned to ice before it reached the decks.  Ice was hanging[Photograph of Table Mountain]
