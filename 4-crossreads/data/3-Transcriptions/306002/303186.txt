<p>12.6.15<br/>Sat. 12th.  Received a bonza mail to-day from Aus. &amp; England, also plenty of papers.  A Sqd. sig's were on duty despatch carrying from 1 to 5 a.m. this morning &amp; Maj. Lorrie (A Sq.) complained to the Adj. about his sig's doing Head Quarters work;  the Adjutant went to Nelson &amp; they had a proper argument, but it ended in us severing connection with H.Q. so I had to report to the S.M. that we are no longer on H.Q. so I suppose we shall be on a sapping party tomorrow, a few hours on the "banjo" will do us no harm, as we are getting quite fat &amp; flobby.  Everything very quiet to-day &amp; one would hardly think a war was going on.  The flies are very bad here &amp; we have a very poor chance of sleeping during the day on account of them.</p>
