the only thing that enables a fellow to carry on. Maffesoni Jun. nearly cut his arm off on the Docking Saw tonight. Finish war for him. He was going to have a finish fight with one of the others in a few days time - man proposes ---
23.10 WedRaining again. wet & miserable Had the petrol Engine & Dynamo on my own last night but had a good passage. Got the Petrol Engine (Japy Freres) on my own again. The little bugger settled her Governor so I had to control by short circuiting the Spark & manipulating the inlet valve Finally Bert fixed up the Governor after 20 Mins delay & she is now running O.K. The little bitch bushed her Governor again within 20 Mins & I had to put in the rest of the shift as a human Governor controlling her by short circuiting the magneto or operating the inlet valve
25.10 Friday Oh that darling?  Japy Engine. She ran like an angel last night, but tonight the little love is peevish. They dismantled the Governor to fit plates on it but one of them is a wee bit too long & Japy is making the most of this excuse to cause trouble.
26.10 SaturdayWent to Poperinghe today & bought a match Box cover & Compass. I will need the latter to determine the polarity of the New? Dynamo that they found in the Pill Box
