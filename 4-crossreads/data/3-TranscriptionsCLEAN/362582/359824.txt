Later - Received Belle's letter of June 12th, a few hours ago. Pleased to hear you have got the "Anzac" Paper alright. Dont you think it very clever? One copy is for Eddy & one to keep for me please. I'm very well & as happy as it is possible under the circumstances, if I could only be in England or France & know how my boy is doing, it would be much better. Suppose I shall get a letter in a couple of days if he is alright. I wish I could see you all & have a good talk about things but letter writing is very unsatisfactory. Dear old mother's birthday is passed & I was thinking of her & just picturing the morning - greetings & excitement. Hope Jess is all the better for her rest & that she had a happy time with you all. We shall have to teach Eddy to Salute went we return. (Jackson & I.) One never knows, I may want to life at home always -
