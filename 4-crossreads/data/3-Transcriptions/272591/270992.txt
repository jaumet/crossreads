I looked at one of Napoleon under a microscope &amp; it shows up beautifully &ndash; was almost like looking at a person himself. Also saw some fine water color paintings by various well known artists. There is also a good display of old time laces &amp; the old time furniture is something to talk about. Also saw a display of bronze figures by Rodin the well known Frenchman. They also have a display of materials of which the ancient Egyptian &amp; Mohammaden garments were made.
