<p>were at Imbros, we cleared out, got aboard a picquet boat (no less) and had the luck to strike "S.S. Partridge" just leaving for Anzac, so we all scrambled aboard, and arrived at Anzac 10 p.m.  When we landed, I made my way to our trenches.  Transport Southland torpedoed.</p>
<p>Sept. 1st<br/>In reserve trenches in day, and observation at night, in Somerville's Post.  Plenty of bullets and shrapnel flying about.  Arthur Gee, of our squadron badly hit in arm.  Feeling very sick.</p>
<p>2nd<br/>Very bad with rheumatism.  Sent down to 1st Field Ambulance and sent from there <strike>by</strike> to the Hospital ship "Salta".  Went on a barge with a lot of sick and wounded, but owing to the rough sea, the small launch was not powerful enough to tow us, and we broke adrift a couple of times, and went floating round the harbour, tossing and pitching like the Dickens.  However, we were finally rescued by the trawler 971 Rose and towed alongside the Hospital Ship, after tossing about for about 2 hours on a trip</p>
