30/12/18 Gourdinne
The people here nearly all wear the ugly but cheap wooden sabots and it is a custom to carry a kind of pannier on the back something like the Yukon pack. Did a round of the billets first thing this morning and found them pretty good all things considered. Two companies routemarched this morning and two went to hear Pat Gorman give a lecture on our History. Afternoon walked past the outskirts of Thy le Chateau and then over to the outskirts of Somzee. Densely populated country this and villages are frequently scattered all over it. Today we had to despatch about 20 men in all on different guards. The arrival of six Tommies to assist Bill Bailey provided some comic relief this afternoon. Officers bridge tournament after mess.
