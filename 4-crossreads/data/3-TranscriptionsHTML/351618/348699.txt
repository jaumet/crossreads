<p>at night. After dark I waited for the wagon &amp; met the horses &amp; Drivers coming back having left the wagon as Pole had been broken. It was the first misfortune since I arrived this time but was followed up later with another one more serious. I telephoned to headquarters about accident &amp; a Limber was sent down. On this I put some cases etc &amp; the balance was carried by the party. On travelling up a narrow road on one of the ridges the Limber was taken in too loose &amp; she turned upside down &amp; nearly rolled down the hill. As the Limber commenced to turn over I let myself go &amp; went down the hill till caught on some roots etc &amp;</p>
