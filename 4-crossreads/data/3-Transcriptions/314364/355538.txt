<p>Sun. Jan.19<br/>Another wet, miserable day. It's enough to drive a man to drink.  I intended to go into Weymouth today but it's out of the question. After Dinner <u>wrote letter no 3 to M.S.</u><br/>Mon.20 Another Boat Roll out &amp; I'm not on it, yet there are numbers of A class now getting Home, &amp; some of 'em haven't even been to France. It is raining again. We ought to soon be used to it.<br/>Tues. 21. It is trying very hard to keep fine. There's not much to write about.Dry Hash &amp; stew appear at Dinner time with unfailing regularity.<br/> Wed.22. "Lippy" &amp; McDonald are both retruned from Leave, &amp; now we have quite an imposing staff in the Q.M. store. After tea I went  iinto Weymouth to get my pants from the Tailors &amp; found the shops all closed so had to return without 'em.<br/>Thur.23. Archie Reed came to see me today. He is employed on the Education Staff at Monte Video. Got my Diary from Ms Sam &amp; letter from Ibby.<br/>Thur. Jan.23 (cont.)<br/>They also sent me a pair of Braces &amp; a Tie towards my "Civvy" outfit Ibby informs me that he is demobilised &amp; back at Business. Lucky Beggar. After tea went into Weymouth again. Got my pants went out to Westham. Saw Serg. Travill who informed me that I was on a Boat Roll whih made me feel inclined to give 3 hearty cheers.  Glorious news for my next letter to B.E. The weather is good. Very cold &amp; frosty &amp; dry.<br/>Fri. 24. Nothing exciting happened. Stew turned up for Dinner again, &amp; rain is not far off. Wrote a few lines to Mr Playford.<br/>Sat.25 Cold day &amp; drizzling Rain. Had quite a busy morning pulling Hut 14 into shape for Stocktaking. A number of Returned Prisoners came into our Hut today. They were in Germany a year &amp; say they received very rough treatment. Many of them died from starvation &amp; they say it is surprising to see how well the Huns are treated in England.</p>
