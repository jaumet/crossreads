The Sentry was not included in the Police, for on his return, he had the very great pleasure of seeing the Military Police Sergeant himself, in the "Clink" (gaol) & the Artillery Corporal had been removed
While staying at Weymouth, most of the Sentry's time was taken up with his friend H[dash] so that after the first two or three days it was very enjoyable.
The first Sunday spent at this Camp was utilized in having a beautiful Motor drive at the invitation of H[dash] during which on a journey of about 70 miles some very fine English scenery was enjoyed
During the course of the ride portions of three counties were traversed thus affording a series of Changing views & surpassingly pleasing varieties of scenery, now on the top of a hill, the landscape, from ones feet stretching away into the distance presenting a wonderful view of houses large, & small cottages partly hidden or apparently nestling among lovely trees & everywhere beautiful flowers & the greenest of grass. Leaving the hill the next experience would probably be a run for about a mile along a hedge protected road with shade trees in rows on each side, their branches quite interlacing formed a large bower immediately over the road itself.
A Motor trip through English scenery & on English roads is most enjoyable & gives one an opportunity of quickly gaining a fairly good idea of the beauty, the calm, & comfort of residential England, outside the Cities.
Every where, in England Scotland Ireland & Wales away from crowded & congested Cities the wonderfully green carpet of grass, the beautiful trees the profuse display of flowers wild & cultivated make the Suburban & Country places wonderfully attractive, while the appearances of the Houses of the higher & the Cottages of the lower, Classes impress upon one that solid comfort & calm & quiet enjoyment are much more studied here than in the younger but more pushing countries.
