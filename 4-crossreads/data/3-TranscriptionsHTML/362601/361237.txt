<p>16 July, Wednesday</p>
<p>F.<br/>Dull &amp; cold. I work all day alone. We have a lot of work. V.A.D's from the shore come aboard. I run ashore for an hour for dinner. I help myself in the Y.M.C.A. Work all afternoon &amp; go ashore at 8 pm to Concert Hall. I hear first song "Someday you'll know how much I love you. You'll be sorry you sent me away". I play for Highland Fling twice. We can't sail because we have such a terrible list to starboard.</p>
