<p>26 December Sunday  1915<br/>I am afraid my notes must be difficult to read &amp; in future will endeavour to write more clearly &ndash;<br/>And so we return to Egypt &ndash;<br/>You remember the saying "Having once tasted the waters of the Nile one is bound to return to Egypt" I hope the same may apply to the old Murrambidgee &ndash; I love the Gum trees but the Palms &amp; the Nile &amp; the Desert have undoubtedly a charm. Arrived Alexandria noon Bright sunshine blue sea &amp; all's well &ndash; The next move I expect will be Cairo &ndash;<br/>Transports Hospital Boats &amp; Warships all following each other.<br/>Arrived safely Aerodrome camp 5 p.m. Monday</p>
