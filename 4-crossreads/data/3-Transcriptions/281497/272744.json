<p>25th.   This morning we all had 5 minutes each with the squad &amp; drilled them as we liked for that time, that took up over 2 hours so we had a fair length of time at drill, after we finished we went &amp; had a swim in the mouth of the "Somme" there is a pretty stiff current running in her, but the water was lovely &amp; we enjoyed ourselves.</p>
<p>They are a fine lot of chaps with the exception of 1 or 2 who are inclined to be conceited &amp; know all, they will learn a severe lesson I'll bet before it is over they will come what the boys call a "gutser"</p>
