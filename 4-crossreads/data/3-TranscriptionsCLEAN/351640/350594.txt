Joe dear:/ 4-3-15. 10p.m.: A letter came from you today.  It was delivered to me about 1 p.m.  Many thanks for it.  The heading is "219 Macquarie St., City, 15-1-15., the journey therefore occupied about seven weeks.  The address on the envelope "Lieut Col J. B. Nash, (S.S.

L. A. B. Wade has done some good work for the irrigation settlements.  R.I.P.  It is to be hoped that a capable man will get his position.  The work to do is of great importance for the country.
You will have seen before now in the illustrated papers pictures about the earthquake disasters in the land of the Aboruzi [Avezzano earthquake, Abruzzo], Italy.
