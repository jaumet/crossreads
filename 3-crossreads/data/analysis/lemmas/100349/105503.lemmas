 30/4/18 . The gale has been blow for three day now . It is give us a most uncomfort time in our crowd quarter . We do not get much to eat and have a wash sometim ; we ship a wave occasion , and it make up for the defici of water . Mani of the chap are afraid the ship will capsiz ; she doe roll veri bad , But the old hooker is battl along at a fair speed . I like to stand for hour by the forward rail of the Promenad Deck to watch the fli spray and spume and swing with the ship as she roll over giant comber , that seem to tower over us one moment then , rush beneath the ship leav a great valley into which we sink . I think this storm is the most fascin thing I have ever seen . A good sailor was lost in me .
