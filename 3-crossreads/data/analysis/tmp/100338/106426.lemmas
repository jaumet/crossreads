On arriv at hospit which was the First Australian Gener at Sutton Veni , I was taken from the Ambulanc carri to the receiv room , where they took all my particular and then carri me through about 300 yard of Corridor to the Influenza ward No 16 . where I was bath , put to bed with hot water bottl and a good dose of medicin .

On Wednesday the 26th the Doctor gave me permiss to get up for one hour after dinner which I did . I continu to get up after dinner everi day until the 5th of March , when I got a fresh cold and was order back to bed , my temperatur again rose to 104.4 and remain high for a day or so , I also caught a sore throat . Today march the 9th I am feel much better , but still have a thick heavi feel in the head , and my throat is veri sore . Sinc I came to hospit I have lost over 14lbs in weight , But as I am now feel and eat better , I should soon begin to regain some of my lost weight . I have onli had two letter from home this last month I have had no letter at all from England . I suppos it is on account of March my address be chang that I have miss them . They have probabl been return to the Base Post Office at London . This sick has been the caus of my miss two boat to Australia . When I get out of here it will be anoth month of wait befor I will be abl to get attach to anoth Boat Roll . 15-3-19 Sinc the last entri my throat has been veri sore , for two day I was unabl to eat or drink anyth . The passag of my throat was complet block up , If I attempt to swallow ani food or drink , it would be forc back through my nose . yesterday the 14th of March the Doctor said he was go to put my case befor the Medic Board and have me return to Australia by Hospit Ship . That will mean that my return will be delay for a month or more . I am still confin to my bed , March but am feel much better and hope to be allow to get up soon . The follow vers is from Tennyson , I saw it in a book yesterday , and it struck me as be as near , and as good a descript of a battl , as it was possibl to give ?Oath , Insult , filth , and monstrous Blasphemi , Sweat , Writh , anguish , Labour of the Lung , In that close mist , And cri for the Light , Moan of the die , and voic of the dead . " This and the various nois such as the explod shell , Rifl and Artillari fire , make a modern battl exact what it is term ? ? A hell on Earth" . Today the 19th the Doctor gave me permiss to get up for a while , This will be the fourth time that I have been allow to get up , I hope I do not get ani more complaint to send me back to bed again . The weather outsid is veri cold , wet and miser , In fact the weather for the last week has been cold , frosti and wet on and off , The wet look as March if it was go to set in for good . I hope the weather will clear up and get much warmer befor I get out of here , or els I am afraid that it wo n't be more than a day or two befor I am back again . On Thursday the 20th it snow veri heavi , toward even a thaw set in and by nightfal all trace of the snow had vanish . On the 22nd we had some more snow , but it was onli slight not enough to cover the ground , It is veri cold outsid and even in the ward around the fire it is not too cheer . I amus myself and pass the time sit near the fire Smoke and read all the day . I am still wait for news of the sail of either a Hospital-Ship or Invalid-Ship . Until the 28th the weather continu to keep veri unsettl , Frosti and cold morn , windi and wet day March have been the rule . I have not heard from Australia for some time but as the Australian mail onli arriv the other day I should soon be get some . Saturday the 29th Last night the snow fell veri heavi , by morn the ground was cover with Snow six inch deep . Everyth look love The Hous , Hedg , tree and earth is cover with a beauti mantl of white , The earli morn sun shine on it make a big improv but it is a bit strong on the eye , The day is veri mild . It is the best day we have had this year . I receiv a parcel from the British red Cross societi , it was sent to me when I was in Germani , and was return to me from Germani through Switzerland after I had left the countri . I receiv it in rather a bad condit but take into consider the journey that it April 1919 has had , it was a wonder that it ever turn up at all . April 5th The weather for the past week has been nice and sunni , The morn were a littl frosti but otherwis it has been all that could be wish for . Sunday April the 6th I went for a walk to Heytesburi Villag which is about three mile distant from this hospit , I went on purpos to see a chap who was in Germani with me . It was rather a long walk for my first time sinc arriv in hospit , The walk was beauti and no doubt will do me a lot of good , I arriv home veri tire . The villag of Heytesburi is the same as most English villag , a cluster of cottag , two or three street , a Hotel and a well pump compris the place April When I arriv back at the Hospit I was order to get all my thing readi to move to Weymouth Camp at 9.30 in the morn . Monday April the 7th I left Hospit and was driven to the Railway Station at Warminst in an Ambulanc , From there I caught the 11am train to Weymouth . The journey was a veri pleasant one , and last from 11am to 3pm with a wait of one hour at Westburri junction for the train . From Weymouth Station I had anoth ride in the Ambulanc to the Camp . The camp is situat at Westham which lie just outsid the town of Weymouth . On arriv at the Camp I went befor the Doctor to be examin and afterward was allot to my hut , The Hut here are all fit with spring bed and is the best Camp the Australian have in the Unite Kingdom . April On Tuesday April the 8th I went befor the Doctor again , He sound my chest and gave me a thorough examin all over and alter my classif from B.2.B to B.1.B. He said that I was well fit , I did not argu with him becaus I have not felt to fit for at least 2 year . To-day Wednesday I am settl down in camp in No2 Compani line and am onc more a Soldier , do fatigu and attend parad , etc . Thursday I went to the town of Weymouth and had a good look around . It is a veri larg town and also kept veri clean . In one part it is not too nice , that is the end where all the ship come in . A line of steamer trade between Weymouth and Jersey . The ocean beach run right along the edg of the town , it is about two mile long , but onli one part of it which is about 400 yard long is fit for bath as the rest of the beach is all shingl . There is no surf whatev , the water is veri smooth when there is no wind blow it 's almost as smooth as glass . They have a nice promenad which follow the beach almost all round , It will be veri nice to come down here of an even . I will get some view of the prettiest place for a souvenir . I also visit Portland harbour which is next to Weymouth but not as pretti , Portland harbour has a larg breakwat built across the entranc to break the forc of the rough sea , and make it a safe anchorag for the Men-o-war . At night I went to what is call the stiff 's opera , but is in realiti the Y.M.C.A free pictur show . April On Friday it was veri cold and wet and toward even it came over veri foggi , but in spite of that I went to Weymouth for a walk along the Promenad , I did not stay long the cold soon drove me back to Camp . On Sunday the 13th Two other chap and myself hire a row boat , and went out for a row , It was love and smooth when we left shore , but after we had been out about an hour it start to cut up veri rough , we were about three mile from shore when we turn to come back , We had a veri hard struggl to get back to calm water , The wave and spray were splash all over us and was also come into the boat . We eventu got out of the difficulti but not befor we had got thorough wet . April On the 15th I again went to Portland Harbour , Sinc my last visit there has been two or three veri larg Warship arriv . The number of warship lie in harbour today is 24 of which nine are veri larg . I also visit the Fort at Noth , I could not see ani sign of the gun as were not allow to go insid . ? Noth Fort " is situat on the headland between Weymouth and Portland harbour . It also had a distant view of the big Convict Prison at Portland , here again I could not get much of what it was like it be on the opposit side of the harbour to me , What bit of it I could see was veri impos , it is situat on a veri high cliff three side of which run down to the water edg , Just a narrow strip of sandi countri join it on to the mainland . Saturday the 19th I again hire a row boat with two other chap and went April out on the water for a coupl of hour , The water was veri smooth which made row a pleasur . About three mile out to sea , one of the surrend German merchant ship was lie at anchor , so we row out to have a look at her , it turn out to be the ?Ponta " and is now be use as a belgian Relief ship , I judg her to be about 7,000 ton . All the Warship that were lie at anchor at Portland , steam out to-day for target practic , We could hear the sound of gun distinct but could not see the ship , They came back to harbour at about 5pm . I receiv a letter from Australia to-day tell me that my first letter from England sinc my return had been receiv . Thursday April the 24th everybodi left Westham Camp and move to Monte-Video Camp about 1 mile further away from Weymouth . We had the band at the head of the column , but for all the good it was they might have stay behind , It was absolut the worst march music that I have ever march to . It was imposs to keep step with it , it was also veri tire . I am now settl down in No 2 Compani and expect to be attach to a boat roll in a day or two . This camp is much the same as the last one for comfort , but not as good in other respect . Monday 28th April To-day I was select for a boat Roll for Repatri to Australia . If my name is not taken off the list beforehand , I will be leav on or about the second of May by the ?S.S. Leicestershire" , and should arriv home about the middl of June . I am go to report to the Doctor to-morrow becaus I have a slight rash break out on the bodi , which I think is ?Scabi " . I shall have time to get it cure befor the boat leav and therebi run no risk of miss it and be disappoint like I was when I got the ?Flu " PART VI MAi 1919 Friday May the 2nd I went befor the Doctor again to be examin final . I pass alright so am almost certain to be leav by this steamer . We had breakfast at 11.30 pm tonight and entrain at Weymouth at 3.30am Saturday morn enrout for Liverpool . At 12 noon we disembark at Liverpool the train took us right on to the wharf . Everybodi was on board by 6.30pm so we were abl to leav at that hour . But we did not start on the journey until two hour later . When I went to bed we were out on the Irish Sea and well on our way . Sunday morn we are travel veri nice , It is rather uncomfort on deck there be a nasti cold wind blow . Dure the day we pass out of the Irish Sea into the St Georg channel , We have a coupl of Paraven out on each side of the vessel to protect it from float May [rest of the page is blank ] [ This page contain a well drawn map entitl Chart No 12 , show the rout taken by the SS Leicestershir from Liverpool to the Suez Canal . It also show the locat of the ship on various date ] [this page is blank ] May contact mine . Monday the 5th saw us in the bay of Biscay with rather a rough sea on and mani men seasick , A sharp cold wind is blow which make it veri uncomfort on deck . Toward even both wind and sea die down a good deal which enabl the ship to ride much smoother , and also allow us to walk about the deck in comfort . Tuesday 6th To-day the weather is beauti and sunni , The sea has onli a slight swell from the strong wind of yesterday . We have pass two ship to-day one a sail ship and the other a steamer . At 10am to-day the Ship 's Log show that we have travel 640 mile sinc 9pm Saturday night . The two minesweep that we had alongsid for protect against float mine have been drawn in , we are now outsid the Danger Zone or mine infest area . At about 6pm we came in sight of the Norther May point of the Spanish coast ( Cape Finister ) at the southern extrem of the Bay of Biscay , Dure the night we pass out of the bay of Biscay and into the Atlantic Ocean . Wednesday the 7th of May . This morn we were pass ship wholesal , by 10am we had pass six steamer and one sail ship . At 11am land was sight , It was the high land on the coast of Portug and is about 20 mile distant on our Port-sid . We kept this land in sight most of the day . The next day we pass a good mani more ship and at noon we sight the South Wester point of Spain , And soon after we sight the coast of Morocco . in the afternoon we enter the Strait of Gibralta with the Spanish coast on our Port side and the Moroccan Coast on the Starboard . The various township along the coast were quit distinct to the nake eye . May At 6.30 in the morn we came abreast of the Gibralta rock , The rock stand out a good distanc from the mainland and is connect to it by a veri narrow stretch of land , It is honeycomb with gun pit and is a veri strong fortress , it command the entranc to the Mediterranean Sea . The action of the sea is crumbl it away in various place along the base . On Friday the 9th we are well in the Mediterranean Sea and out of sight of land , The crew are spread awn across the deck to protect us from the heat of the Sun 's ray , The next day Saturday we sight the coast of Algeria which we could see quit plain till after noon , when we lost sight of it again . Dure the afternoon we again sight land on the Starboard side , which afterward turn out to be a veri small island . Accord to the Ship 's Log , we have travel 2,500 mile May sinc we lefti Liverpool . It has been blow hard all day and is veri uncomfort on deck although the wind is not cold or the sea rough . It is veri hard to secur a shelter spot on deck to sit and read in , owe chiefli to the small of the ship for the larg number of troop that are on her . The weather continu to be nice and warm for the rest of the journey to Port-Said . We arriv at Port-Said on the afternoon of Thursday the 15th and anchor insid the harbour . As we enter the harbour we saw four French warship and one English , which were anchor just insid the entranc . They are a veri old class of ship . We are not allow to go ashor here , so I cannot say what the port is like , But what I can see of the town from the water May look veri nice , There are plenti of soldier on shore most Lighthorsemen . There is two other troopship in harbour as well as us , They have imperi troop aboard and I believ that they are go to England . In the even we were besieg with nativ boat full of the nativ sell all sort of silk and other ware . They ask you enorm price for thing that are worth onli a few shill , and if you are fool enough to pay it you can . You can general manag to beat them down a lot , for instanc if they ask you 30/ - for a length of Silk you can run them down and final purchas it from them for about [indecipher ] 5/-. We are go to take one or two Light hors Officer on board from here . At 5.30pm after we had finish take on all the fresh water that was want to last us till our next port of call May we weigh anchor and proceed on our way . At the entranc to the Suez Canal there are two wreck with their mast just visibl abov water . One of them was sunk in 1916 by the enemi . They suspect that wen enemi agent got on board somehow and place a time bomb down below , that was time to blow up when the ship was in the Suez-Can and so block the canal to ship , But evid they did not succeed becaus both ship are quit clear of the entranc , and to all appear , look as if they were lie at anchor when they sank . At 6pm we left Port-Said and enter into the Suez-Can . We kept go through the canal all night , A searchlight was use to light the way so that we would not run on the May bank , The canal is veri narrow and it would not be more than 100 yard wide at ani part , It would be non exert to throw a stone to the land from the ship . At 5am on Saturday morn we reach lake-bitt which is the largest of the three lake that are along the canal , We anchor here for an hour to let two ship that were come in an opposit direct through the canal to pass us . Lake Bitter is about 15 mile across at the widest point and is in place veri shallow . We left the lake again at 8am and proceed on our way through the canal to Port-Suez arriv there at about 12 noon and anchor just off from the town . At 2pm we weigh anchor and again start on our way , At nightfal we May had left Suez far behind , were in the Gulf of Suez with the land quit close on both side of the ship . The Suez Canal is a wonder piec of work and I should think that it would not be ani more than 100 yard wide from bank to bank , 50 ft deep and 90 mile long . From Port Said a road and railway line follow the right bank for a veri long distanc . On the Egyptian side at interv of from 5 to 10 mile there are signal station which communic the prevail weather condit on the Ocean , to the ship as they pass . At Port Said there is a statut of the Frenchman ( De Lessep " ) who construct the canal . that for everi yard of the 90 mile of Canal , one life was lost in construct . De Lessep who was so success May [this page is blank ] [a neat drawn map of the rout taken from Port Said to Ceylon , spell Cylon on the map . Daili posit are also shown ] May [this page is blank ] May in construct this canal , attempt to cut the Panama-Can through but fail , went bankrupt and die a pauper . The speed at which ship are allow to travel through the Canal is not to exceed five knot per hour . I was unabl to see much of what exist along the bank of the canal , owe to it be dark when we pass through the grater part of it . Along the Arabian side there are militari camp for a long distanc , The Australian Light Hors are in the major . After pass Lake Bitter I saw a lot of trench and barb wire entangl along both bank , which were put there to form defenc work to protect Suez Township and canal from enemi attack . The major of the countri on both bank is flat desert land with a fertil spot visibl everi now and again . I cannot say what Suez township would be like if inspect close I could not form ani idea by May what I could see of it from the steamer , although it look to be a veri clean place . Soldier seem to be in the major here also . Kakhi can be seen everywher you look . Camp and Militari hospit surround the town , There is also a lot of tree in the place and veget seem to flourish here quit well , It is not like the desert a few mile away where you can look for mile with scarc a sign of ani veget visibl noth but sand and sand . It has been boil hot all day and I have found it imposs to find a cool spot on the whole ship . Awning are spread abov the deck to protect us from the direct ray of the sun but even underneath these the heat make the tar blister and boil from between the plank of the deck . Fli fish and Porpois have been about the ship in veri larg number today . I amus myself May watch these fish and smoke . In the Red Sea Thursday 22nd of May Toward noon we pass a larg group of Island about 12 in number . They are call the 12 apostl and are situat veri close to the entranc of the Red-Sea and are in one of the hottest part of the world . At 7pm we pass out of the Red-Sea through the entranc which is call Hell 's Gate into the Gulf of Aden . These last few day it has been dread hot , the hottest that I have ever felt befor , It has been imposs to keep cool , The sweat has been pour out of me wholesal . I think that the entranc to the Red-Sea has been veri appropri name when they name it the Hell s-gate . In my opinion Hell itself could not be ani hotter . Shark and Porpois have been about the ship almost all day , And May to-night the Phosphorus has been veri preval in the water . The last few night the southern cross was to be seen veri low down on the horizon in a Souther direct . On Friday the 23rd we were well out in the Indian Ocean , The sea is veri choppi and a lot of the men have been seasick , I am alright myself but there is a lot more men on board , that look as if it would be a great relief to them if they could onli be sick . We have kept land in sight from earli morn until afternoon . The land was the North-east coast of Africa and it was on our Starboard side . At about three Pm we pass a small island on our Port side . Fli fish have been about in larg number , we have pass through shoal of them . Porpois also have been constant ahead of the ship . May The weather has cool off consider now , so I am take to open air treatment of sleep out on deck , If the weather continu to keep fine I will be nice and comfort , or if we run into a Storm or it come on to rain I will get wet , becaus I am right up on the Forecastle-Deck in the nose of the boat . It is much cooler up on deck than it is down below also the air is much more fresh . The Ship is get veri light now and has risen 5 ft higher out of the water than when we left Liverpool . At Liverpool the ship was draw 29 feet of water , now she is onli draw 24feet . This is caus by the larg amount of coal and water we have use sinc we left , The slight sea that is now run is quit enough to make her pitch and roll about a good deal . May Sunday 26th of May yesterday we ran into a fair heavi sea which made the Ship pitch about so much that it was necessari for the Captain to pump some water into the Fore-Castl well deck for ballast , After the tank had been fill the ship rode much smoother . At night we had some rain which wash me out of my comfort posit on deck and forc me to go below again , It was veri hot between deck and I could not get to sleep until after midnight . The Phosphorus was more notic last night than ever befor , probabl it was due to the heavi atmospher and stormi water . To-day it is rain hard on deck but the sea has not such a heavi swell as yesterday , I am go to write to Etta and to England to-night and post them when I reach May Thursday May the 29th These last few day we have had some rather sever Monsoon weather , The sea has been veri rough and the rain has been frequent veri sharp and heavi . This morn we enter the harbour of Colombo and 11am . The Cruiser Sydney and Suppli ship Platypus , with four of the surrend submarin were in the harbour when we arriv . No sooner had we anchor , than we were besieg by nativ bumboat . These craft are veri pecular , they have an outrigg attach secur to one side to protect them from capsiz , while the boat proper , consist of a portion of a tree trunk hollow out , with just enough room for one nativ and a box or two of silk or imit jewelri . The occup of these cano offer May you silk , curio , fruit and imit jewelri at enorm price , usual five time their real valu , and conclud with take one quarter of his origin offer , with an air of injur innoc . The harbour is form of three breakwat , enclos an area of , I should think , about 1,000 acr . In rough weather the wave break and reach to a height of 40 to 100 ft abov these wall . When we enter the water was not veri rough outsid , but the wave were then break fulli 40 ft abov the wall . The land look veri pleasant when view from the water . The love green of the veget is much more pleasant to look upon than the barren and parch shore of Port-Said and Suez : We were allow on shore form 2pm till 6pm and I had a good look round the Fort which this portion of Colombo May is call . I visit the Gordon Garden in Queen Street , and saw the Legisl Council Chamber and other Govern build which are situat almost Opposit the Garden . I also saw Queen hous which is the resid of the Govenor of the Coloni , it adjoin the Gordon Garden . Another interest structur is the Colombo Lighthous which is situat at the corner of Chatham St and Queen Street , It is unlik most Lighthous , this one be in the form of a squar tower , It also serv the purpos of a clock tower there be a clock fix about halfway up . Anybodi pass by , that had not seen the lantern alight , would never dream that it was a lighthous , It seem veri strang that a lighthous should be situat almost in the centr of town . The street of Colombo are fair wide and are kept veri clean , The hous for May the most part are veri old and are limit to one floor , They are chiefli occupi by nativ , who trade in curio , jewellri provis . The major of the larger place are big British merchant 's offic , and Busi place . The mode of travel in Colombo is chiefli by Rickshaw or Motor . In place they have the Electric tram run , but they are not often patronis by the European . One thing I notic here was the absenc of European in the street , There seem top be veri few British about at all . Although the sign and newspap are most in English . We are to allow on shore again to-morrow , so I shall be abl to have anoth look round , and if possibl get a souvinir or two to take home with me . The follow day Friday I again went on May 1919 shore was unabl to see round more of the town becaus I was due back on board at 2pm . I was also unabl to go into the nativ quarter , there be guard post on all the main thoroughfar into the suburb to prevent us from go into them . I would have like to go into the suburb , becaus I believ it to be the prettiest place of Colombo , also I should think it would be a better place to see nativ life than in the citi . Befor I left for the ship , I purchas a coupl of nativ ornament for a Souvinir . We left Harbour at 7pm and ran straight into rough windi weather , with a voyag of from 10 to 14 day to Freemantl W.A. The light of Colombo had vanish from sight befor I turn in . On the 31st of the month we were well out in the Indian Ocean and out of sight of land . The sea is smooth .
