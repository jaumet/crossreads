11th Nov Sunday Left France
Bean called for me with his car at 11 am and we ran through to Boulogne. We had a particularly enjoyable time in spite of the rains. The beautiful Avenues are ablaze with those gorgeous tints of Autumn, and the leaves thickly strewn on the roadways, were being added to by clouds of others falling. We had an uneventful trip to London (the voyage across Channel being very calm) where we arrived at 7 pm. I put up at my usual quarters in the Imperial Hotel Russell Sq.
