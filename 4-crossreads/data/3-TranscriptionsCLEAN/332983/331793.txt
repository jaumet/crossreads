Recieved a package of writing paper and envelopes from Vance also one paper from home. Today is again windy and dusty, a little rain would do good. The Asiatic coast a good shelling from the French heavy guns 10/9/1915 A terrific bombardment by battleships on the Asiatic coast last evening. French aerial torpedos used freely on the extreme right. As gun shooting from Asia to here. 6.30. Pieces of shells falling in our horse lines. It is a beautiful gun, all you can hear is a screech, bang, and then see a cloud of smoke and dust  It frighten a lot I can assure you. At 6.P.M. The Battle ships shooting behind Krithia Village. Rifle fire very consistant last night. 11/9/15 Cool windy and dusty, otherwise quiet. Rifle fire severe last night. A bit of a bombardment on the right flank. A bit of a dispute yesterday,  A  N.C.O. and five men sent on fatigue work over to the 42nd Divisional Artillery Head Quarters. The Non Com got annoyed
