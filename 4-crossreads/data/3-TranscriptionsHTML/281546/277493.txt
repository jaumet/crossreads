<p>Evening that the Wounded Man had Died, his Lungs had been penetrated and had Bled to Death. <br/>Sunday April 6th.  Being off duty all day and the Weather beautiful and somewhat warm I arranged with a Mate to pay Berck Plage, a Seaside Resort a visit, about 8 miles from the Camp. After a good Dinner we left at 2 pm for the Station at Quend and at 2-45 the Train came along and soon found room in a carriage. This Train as a rule is very long and always crowded, it only took fifteen minutes to reach Rang de Fleurs, where we had to change into a Metro Railway, which is a narrow Railway 3 ft 3 " in width, with light Rolling Stock, there were three Carriages, of 8 compartments each one seating 10 Persons, and a small Locomotive. A good crowd detrained from the Broad Guage and we had to hurry to obtain a seat, just before leaving at 3.30 the Conduteress collected the Fares <strike>at 3d each</strike> which was 3d to Berck Plage. After about a 20" run we arrived at our destination.</p>
