<p>FRIDAY, MAY 23, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine, with a few odd showers. 3 pts</p>
<p>Rode round bottom end with</p>
<p>Peter in morning and along</p>
<p>the trail I made yesterday.</p>
<p>The rabbits had been playing</p>
<p>all about it, &amp; taken lots</p>
<p>of the baits but only found</p>
<p>one dead rabbit. Round the</p>
<p>Hill paddock with Peter &amp; Linda</p>
<p>in afternoon.</p>
