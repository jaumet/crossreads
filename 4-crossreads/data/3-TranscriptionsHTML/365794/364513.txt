<p>Sunday 21st April 1917 [1918]<br/>3 weeks of April gone &amp; not once out in the sunshine of Egypt or enjoying the sunrises or sunsets!<br/>A day of quiet reading, sewing, patience playing.  No trace of Sunday here.  A khamsein blowing all day but very little dust at Choubra.<br/>At 12 m.d. comes little Scotch Sister Moore to tell me I have a negative and lucky to secure one first go as sometimes many "positives" occur.<br/>No trace of the M.O. at all.  Allowed up for 1 hour &amp; strange it feels to have tea at a little table instead on [of] sitting up in bed.</p>
