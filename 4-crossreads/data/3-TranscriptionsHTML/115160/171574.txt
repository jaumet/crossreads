<p>Dear Old Dad,</p>
<p>I see by the latest letters I&#39;ve just received that you have had a very rough time of it indeed. &nbsp;It has not appeared from previous letters that it had been so serious, but I see that you had pneumonia. &nbsp;I am very glad to know you have got over it, and I hope that the rest and plenty of rum and milk will have restored you again to good health. &nbsp;I hope you picked up well at Coonamble, and long ere you receive this, you will be boxing on in good style as of old. &nbsp;It will then be just a few short months before you will be retiring to enjoy the fruits of your arduous labours. &nbsp;May you be completly recovered and healthy to enjoy a good spell is my earnest hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might remember me to the Nesses when next you write. &nbsp;Is Willie married now?</p>
<p>Cheerio then, Dad, &amp; I hope you have a big smile up and able to blow the froth off a long-sleaver.</p>
<p>Your loving son, James.</p>
