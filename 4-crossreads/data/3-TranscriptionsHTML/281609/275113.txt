<p>4th Dusty &amp; warm. Hardly a gun spoke all day till about 6 pm when our artillery opened out. For about 12 hours the guns roared. Of course we did not have all the say for Fritz kept up a hail of shrapnel &amp; high explosive to our trenches. Star shells were soaring in the sky intermixed with our artillery signals. Our lads "hopped the parapet" at 2 am and gained their objectives with comparatively small losses.<br/>5th Beautiful day. Fritz continues to send shells into the town. Hundreds of prisoners captured during the charge march through the town under escort.<br/>6th Very misty. Shells were bursting in and around the town all night. Artillery duel kept up all day. Out to trenches. Plenty of bombs flying about also shrapnel.<br/>7th Out at trenches. Shrapnel &amp; smoke [indecipherable] flying about.<br/>18 pounders keep up demonstration all day &amp; occasionally the big guns would bark. Trip to Frauvillers. Gee! Had rather a "large night! "No bace pour moi"<br/>8th Dull. Artillery quiet. Plenty of bombs were thrown by both sides. Shrapnel was exploding</p>
