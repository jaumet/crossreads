22 December 1918   1919  SundayRafa.  Here I am back with the Regiment, if you look at Diary about Jany 9th 1916 You may see mention of our fight here & a GREEN TREEWe are now camped within 300 yards of it again.  All leave cancelled owing to burning of Bedouin Village but in a few months I hope we will be embarking it has been a great disappointment to all 1914 officers & their people- but Ill save money out here & be able to go strait to Bronte when I do get home-I have a Doctors Certificate to say I am unfit for active service enlarged spleen but if I may not go home, cannot do nothing so here I am.
