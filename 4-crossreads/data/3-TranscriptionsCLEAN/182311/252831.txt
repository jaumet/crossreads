 protective artillery box enclosing the attacked area in a fence of bursting shells; it was an inspiring sight, an awe-ing sight and it was a sight to inspire one with the greatest confidence.  Frank, myself and the Sergt-Major, then left, meeting a few of the lads waiting for us at the ditch, we strolled back, we didn't want to run  and  we felt  too  tired  ^  but not too tired  to start a song "And we really had a most delightful evening" then we climbed down over our own parapet and sat down in a dugout and thought sadly that though our casualties were light, there were some of our best that would suffer much pain, some too xx but only a few, who had left the regiment and would be buried in a quiet corner amongst many other noble lads who had died for Britain's honour. 
    During the whole of our operation Fritz had been strafing "No Man's," our front line and our communications, but when all were clear our artillery ceased, then the Germans, and soon a great quiet came over the locality.  This was our quarter share of the operation and similar though not equally successful work was carried out in both sides of our position, resulting in the successful raid reported in the enclosed cutting from a daily paper. 
   
 Yours sincerely,
