<p>St. Patricks Hospital Malta 5.9.1915<br/>Dear Papa,<br/>I am leaving Malta to day for England I dont know what my address will be but will write again later from there.  I expect I will be going back to Australia from there after a while as I expect it will be a long while before my leg gets right.  Had a bit of a drive round Selima, Valletta   &amp; Floriana the other day as I expected to be leaving soon.</p>
