<p>February 1915<br/>Saturday 13<br/>About 4 oclock this morning we were attacked by the 4th Batt as enemy. After exchanging shots with a small party of the enemy, we retired on the [indecipherable] position. The enemy were now advancing in numbers up the slope, but with the fire from our position &amp; the raking enfilade fire of the platoons entrenched on the opposite side of the waddy we repulsed them with great loss.<br/>About day break the enemy was seen retreating in good orders. We had stew for breakfast. Then marched away. Had a couple of hours spell &amp; did a magnificent charge against the fourth who were entrenched in front of us &amp; to right &amp; left of us.<br/>Marched back to camp had a good wash. Holiday for rest of day</p>
<p>Sunday 14<br/>Had a good nights rest last night. Slept like a king. There was no dew owing to a slight breeze which was blowing. The breeze was chilly. Grand weather all day. The lads held a bit of a concert about 8.30. I think to learn some new songs for the march. Tea and one biscuit per man was issued at 9.15 P.M. Did a 10 mile march. The night was dark but warm. Two more deaths this week in our Batt.</p>
