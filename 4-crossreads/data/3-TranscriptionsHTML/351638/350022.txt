Now unless we carried the Straits by a coup de main it was obvious from the start that our fleet would not be able to remain indefinitely off the coast because the Huns far away in the North Sea would be certain to send some submarines to assist their ally, and in addition there was always the chance of some Austrian submarines escaping the blockade of the Adriatic.
