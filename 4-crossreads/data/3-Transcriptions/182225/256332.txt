<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; TUESDAY 1&nbsp;&nbsp; AUGUST</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. The Battery was on duty. Bill &amp; Jack &amp; Self were mess orderlies &amp; as a lot of the Battery were getting their meals away we had an easy time. I got letters from Linda (2), &amp; Marj. Allison, also a wire from Mother to say that she would be in Salisbury that night</p>

<p>I doubt whether the wisest of us know what our motives are, and whether some of the actions of which we are the proudest will not surprise us when we trace them, as we shall one day, to their source. &mdash;</p>
