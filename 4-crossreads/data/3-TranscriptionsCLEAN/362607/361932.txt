 The Village Inn [indecipherable] down to the Church. It is out of bounds to Soldiers & therefore the "Boat out" us. You will notice the thatched  roof. There are 2 thatched to one Slate here. These Pictures were only taken recently as shown by the Soldiers in the Picture. There are very many steam engine Lorries used here with wide iron wheels. It is very wet in the winter but in a Hospital it won't matter. Route marching round the lanes is all right but the creeks & ditches are starting to fill up now & I guess the water is too cold to swim.  Love Harry
