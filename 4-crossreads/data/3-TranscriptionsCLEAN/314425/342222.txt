  
 other two Battalions in seperate companies with their own officers & N.C.O.s We heard this evening that General Jellibrand met the delegates and had a long talk with them, resulting that they would be supplied with rations and they were to carry on as a Battalion. Also that the Padre bought a large box of tinned fish to give the men their dinner. The men had a concert & meeting in the evening & the padre was vigorously cheered. 
 Sunday Sept 22. 1918. 1510 A fine day. We are all to return to the 37 today. The battalion is to be rebuilt & strengthened. Several including myself do not want to go back but rather remain here with this Battalion. The 38. Battalion is camped on the side of a ridge facing the ruined village of Allaines. Enemy aircraft were very active this morning. There was plenty of rain this evening & the ground is very muddy. 
 Monday Sept 23 1918. 1511. This is my birthday. [shorthand] I am 43 today. It is fine today but cold and windy. The companies here are having bath parades in fighting order. The sun crosses the line today going south & this moon is the harvest moon. I put in an application to the C.O. of the 38 Batln to remain here & to be transferred to the Transports as a farrier.
