 12/8/14 I was at my post in the coding office at 4 o'clock this morning by which time we were moving into S. Georges Channel. Now what was this to mean. From my window I saw a schooner short out from the New Britain side. It went merrily on its way as if battleships &amp; war were matters of no moment until a four inch gun barked angrily and a nasty shell buried its nose in the water about 200 yds ahead of her. You can make sure there was no slackness in "downing foresail" and in a few minutes, the captain comes on board. Evidently his explanation is satisfactory for he is allowed to go back to the undisguised regret of the ships company. Meanwhile, smoke is discerned to the southward and the  Encounter reports three of the enemy's cruisers. Down we dart to our stations, quivering with excitement but steady. Another false alarm, for which the Encounter gets a good "wigging", but there is something &amp; the same ship is told off to look into things. It is a tramp collier, the Zambesi which gives a plausible explanation, which Lewin accepts &amp; off she goes. But there is a flap on board the flag who cannot find such a name in Lloyd and the cruiser is hauled back again, this time to be examined properly. She is found to be a deep dyed traitor, for she is a British ship carrying German dispatches, wireless gear &amp; an operator for the German fleet. The skipper is brought aboard under arrest, a prize crew put on the Zambesi under Lieut. Garcia to be sent to Sydney and off she goes. Camberleys landed a party at Simsonshafen, set fire to the post office, &amp; flapped about a bit &amp; all is over. He must get out before dark, &amp; we must go too. I must not forget to add that the Encounter got a damn good talking to for letting this traitor almost slip away. 13/8/14 We are making our way now along the coast of Bougainville where the German fleet was last reported, but there is no sign of their presence anywhere &amp; we must return to Port Moresby to coal. The Sydney has only 200 or 300 tons in her bunkers &amp; we have only a few days supply. It is really very interesting running thro' these tropical seas. We had a close view of New Britain &amp; Ireland. Vast plantations of cocoa nut palms pd. by easily made out; pretty houses buried in tropical foliage &amp; grouped homely wise around a picturesque church. All sorts of coral islands &amp; reefs fringe the coast of Bougainville, which has the reputation of having the savagest natives in the whole Pacific Seas.
