C. says I need a thorough rest and recommends a warmer climate, and it's all I need &ndash; warmth and sunshine.  Matron fixes me up in an ambulance, hot water bags, rugs, and tucks a small bottle of whisky in when she says good-bye.  I might add that the driver will find that later.

Then from 21 a Sammy M>O. joins us and I keep him well employed with managing the slipping rugs.  I'll repeat again that there is something very attractive and lovable about the Americans.  I make for the Sick sisters at Abbeville via Peronne and Amiens. 
 Good-bye I did hope to mention Paris, tell a little more of Cannes and this present lovely place St Albans, but if you are not already tired of the scribble I will continue in my next. 
 Yours A Donnell.
