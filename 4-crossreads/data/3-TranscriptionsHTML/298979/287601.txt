<p>about 20 years of age with a badly wounded arm. Being quite boy his case is discussed (amongst the men) with much more interest Will the arm (Wing it is called by them) be saved? What will the "kid" do with only one "wing" to fly with? I hope they succeed in saving it?</p>
<p>Not a very long time to wait, the "Kid" is carried back. Now a quiet still unconcious form showing scarcely signs of life. His bed is situated right at the far end of the ward. They carry him silently but very gently past the whole of both rows of fellow wounded.</p>
<p>The process of transferring him from the stretcher to the bed is keenly watched. The Sisters &amp; Nurses again start to tenderly prepare to dress the wound. They know. Every other patient in the Ward props himself up as best he can &amp; with craned neck, eager eyes intently watch the process.</p>
<p>The bloodstained wrappings are removed a pitiable sight presents itself, the arm has been sawn off, right across the bicep, the protruding bone exudes natures healing matter to seal the exposed part, to await which, the flesh, to eventually cover it is seen to be tied back in strips upon the part above. It looks a sorry sight.</p>
<p>After doing what can only be done, in silence the Sister &amp; Nurses stand patiently watching. The stillness in the whole ward almost becomes painful, every man is trying to read the tense strained faces of the watching women for some little indication of what the result will be.</p>
<p>A slight moan escapes from the mutilated prostrate form upon the bed, a sigh breaks forth from one of the Nurses, a sigh of relief from pent up feelings, the Sister stoops to pat the pillow &amp; adjust the bedclothes &amp; turning with a wan smile very quietly tells the nearest men He is coming round! He will soon be alright!</p>
<p>Every one is very greatly relieved and in a few minutes the Ward resumes its ordinary condition, with good humoured</p>
