 dusting we got about 6 weeks ago. Aunt Mary writes regularly and sends papers, it was in one of them I saw Symons' name amongst the casualties. Poor Brusher is having a rather miserable time, it is a great pity he did not join an Australian unit, Egypt at least would not have affected his health. Even now in the middle of summer, it has rained every second day, it must be just awful in the winter, I dread being here then. Am afraid that we will have to put up with it, the War certainly wont be over. 
 With love to all your people from Yours sincerely Don
