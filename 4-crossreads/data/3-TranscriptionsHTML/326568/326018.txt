<p>May 6th<br/>10th.  After a very pleasant journey through the Mediterranean we arrived at Port Said at 3 p.m. this afternoon &amp; immediately began to coal.<br/>The "Karagola" about one hour ahead of us.<br/>11th.   All day coaling at Port Said where we have held aquatic sports.<br/>This evening at 6 p.m. we moved &amp; are now in the Canal, with "Karagola" some two miles astern.<br/>Port Said is not very impressive deriving its importance solely from the fact that is the N. Canal terminus.</p>
