<p>Extract:- "A Magic Stone" Robert Blatchford.<br/>"I love diamonds &ndash; love them for their beauty, for their fire, their colour, their sparkle, their distinction.   Rubies are splendid;   opals have mystery; sapphires remind one of the sea;  pearls are pretty in their purity.   But diamonds for me.   Diamonds are like stars and roses and peacock's tails and summer clouds:  they are royal;  they are alive;  they have souls;  they drink up sunshine like champagne, and then flash out marvellous and valiant dreams.   I love 'em."  etc.</p>
<p>There is imagination there!</p>
