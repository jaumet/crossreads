<p>August 1915<br/>Saturday14<br/>Fine   Quiet so far except for the snipers cracking now and again. Have just taught a dare devil Turk to keep his head down. Cannot say whether I knocked him or not. He was showing head and shoulders above the trench carrying sand bags for his parapet</p>
<p>Sunday 15<br/>Fine Lovely mornings, getting warm towards mid-day with cool evenings. The nights get chilly and we have to beware of colds. Our Batt. was relieved from trenches this afternoon by the 4th Batt.</p>
