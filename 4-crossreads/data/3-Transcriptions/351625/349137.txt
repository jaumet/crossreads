<p>good so that in all we are doing very well putting on condition &amp; getting in good nick &amp; would quite enjoy it if we were only near home.  Our leave has not come off yet, I don't think it will for a couple of weeks as next week we are shifting to another camp about 20 miles away to a place called &ndash; where the winter is felt less severely.  All the Australians are shifting &amp; the Americans I believe are taking our places.  The weather has been beautiful here lately plenty of warm sunny days but today we have had a change &amp; it is cold &amp; windy.  I hope it does not last although I expect in another month the cold will begin to set in properly.  On Sunday afternoon we went for a walk with Arthur over to the old villages where the village blacksmith under the chestnut tree &amp; the old church where the "Village Blacksmith" went, all stands today as it stood then, the whole village is quaint &amp; old</p>
