 SPECIAL HOSPITALS FOR OFFICERS (Lord Knutsford's Committee) No. 3 HOSPITAL - FOR ORGANIC NERVE CASES 
 EMPIRE HOSPITAL VINCENT SQUARE LONDON] 3.5.1917 
 Dear Major Scott-[indecipherable], I am sorry I have been so long in writing you about Lt Ferguson. I wanted to get Dr Head's opinion of him &amp; he saw him yesterday. 
 On going over him carefully it was evident that there was a large functional element in the motor &amp; sensory paresis. What I think has happened is that the local concussion  caused oedema of the cortex of the L. face &amp; arm area &ndash; with consequent affection probably slight of these parts. As you know he carried on for some time after he was hit &amp; that the severe paralysis of the Right side &amp; the Aphasia came on fairly gradually during that time &amp; was superadded on the organic effect. So the clinical picture that may have resulted from cortical injury (which is I think slight) is hidden by the functional paresis. The aphasia at all events now is not I think organic. 
 Dr Head has corroberated my diagnosis &amp; the prognosis of course is very good.
