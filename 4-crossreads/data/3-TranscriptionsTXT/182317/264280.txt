 Captain Brett Hilder, 183 Edinburgh Road, Castle Crag, Sydney. Telephone: 95 2677 7th January 1965 Dear Sir, I am compiling a list of the paintings by my late father, J.J. Hilder, who died in 1916, and endeavouring to list the present owners. I an old list of my father's is an entry of a sale to "Mr Justice Ferguson" of a "decorative panel" for  &pound; 5-15-6, and I believe that this refers to your father. I should be very grateful if you could give me any information about this "panel" which may have consisted in 3 or more small sketches. The date of sale was July 1911, through the agent Mr Albers. Yours sincerely Brett Hilder
