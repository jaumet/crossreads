<p>young for this life,  about 8 or 9 casualties occurred around the camp. The 8th have their usual good luck, escaping injury. At 7 p.m. the bearers move off. A Section again having to go to the further post which was about 5 miles away,  five squads altogether were to report themselves at this post,  only 3 turned up eventually, two squads got lost &amp; reported back to a rear post the following day.   It was'nt much good us working short handed. Our three squads did not arrive at their destination till 1.30 a.m. the next morning, a pretty rotten experience. Flares going up all round us &amp; the whistling of shells overhead trying to find a place in the dark,  luckily we were not called up so obtained a little sleep. Our home is a small hole dug in the side of a sunken road with a stretcher for a roof. At 9 p.m. Wiggins &amp; I took two walking</p>
