<p>Mr Carter said he would write again and see if he could do something for me but really I do not think he can do anything, so you might see what you can do for me with Mr C.L. Jones, when he arrives.<br/>While I was there I got some money, 12 pounds for myself and 5 pounds for Harry so will you  fix it up at Sydney when they advise you.<br/>While I was in London I saw Chec Chin Chow at His Majesty's theatre which was lovely and on Saturday went to Tower of London and saw most beautiful tropies of war and jewels and crowns of various Kings and Queens. To day I have applied for leave (12 days) and intend to go over to the Island and may leave here on Friday. When I come home Harry is also going on 12 days and we are also allowed a free warrant to travel.<br/>We are both in good health but absolutely fed up and want so much to come home to you all. But my dear people for God sake don't worry as we are doing all we can.<br/>So now will close with fondest love to all and hope soon to come home to you all.<br/>Bye Bye<br/>Believe me<br/>Your loving Son and Brother<br/>Ellis</p>
