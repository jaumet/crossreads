headquarters without of staying at the battery. We waited for a good while for a lull in the shelling but it would not stop so returned to the wagon lines, as we came away, late.
4th June 1917. Got up at 8 oclock. An inquiry was held into last night's episode. Result strafing of the NCO in charge. Left again for the battery at 10 oclock. Got up to Ploegstreet was turned back on another road because Fritz was shelling our road. Made our long way round reached the battery safely at 2 oclock. Dumped the goods off got a doss in an old gunpit for the night.
5th June 1917. Got out of bed at 11.30 proceeded to have some lunch. My word this is the war right enough here. Nothing but guns shells everywhere. Fritz peppers every part of the wood with all sorts of calibre. He is giving our Australian artillery little hell all the time. This morning 2 officers some men were killed in one battery. I shall be glad when we oust him out of this as he makes it too willing for us poor blokes. Went on duty at 4 oclock. While on duty Fritz started to shell the battery with heavy stuff. Result all the men had to clear off. I had to stay on in the dugout.
