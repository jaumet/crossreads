With the anxiety of  the Colonel to prevent a feeling of discontent gaining ground in the times of waiting that are ahead, a new activity is arising, & the enouie & indifference among a certain crowd of the Ambulance, seems to be passing.  The debates have no doubt helped to cause this, but the departure of our old friend Mr. Garland the W.O., who though as a sergeant on the Peninsular he was popular, was of late very unpopular, has had a good effect on the attitude of the men to movements for their good.
