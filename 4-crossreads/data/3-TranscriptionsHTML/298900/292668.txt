<p>the battalion &amp; fixed them up for the night but had to get two stables scrubbed out to make them presentable.   Turned in about 10 oclock after issuing some dressings to the 53rd.</p>
<p>Saturday 6th April<br/>   Called up at 4 A.M. breakfast 4.30.   C. section to move out at 5.30.   A &amp; B Sections to stand by to move out at 7.30.   Packed up everything &amp; had fallen in when orders came to stand by again.    Managed to find [indecipherable] extra rations so had another breakfast.    More sick arriving had to unpack again in order to attend to them.   Great aerial activity, large numbers of our planes being about, one of ours being driven down &amp; a Fritz being brought down in flames in our vicinity.   C. Section sent down for urgent supplies so went along in Car after dinner to see what they required.   Rather an interesting trip as I passed through the support lines &amp; [indecipherable] posts which had their complement of men mostly occupied in cleaning themselves up &amp; basking in the sun as it had been wet.  Straw from neighbouring stacks was availed of to make them comfortable.   Several dead horses lying about</p>
