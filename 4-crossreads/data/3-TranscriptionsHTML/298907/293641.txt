<p>Got a letter from Jacky Hayes this morning with some rotten news telling me that my old cobber &amp; pal Jock Mackie had been badly wounded &amp; had died before they could get him to hospital poor old Jock is buried somewhere round Hazebrouck &amp; the soil that covers him is surely richer than ever it was before, for Jock was above all a soldier in every sense of the word &amp; as true a chap as ever breathed it will be a long long time before Jocks old face &amp; figure fade out of my mind, that's 2 of my best cobbers killed now Reg Duke &amp; Jock &amp; still I am left I often wonder why the bonza chaps are taken &amp; such affairs as I left dosn't seem right, but I suppose a higher power than we poor mortals</p>
