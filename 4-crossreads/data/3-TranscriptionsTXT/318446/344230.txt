Anzac Police Corps, the latter coming off second best, the alleged reason being that some of the police reported two sisters - from 14th General for overstaying leave.  They are a low crowd any way - the Police I mean, most of them can be squared, & a lot of them are the worst cold footed scum of Australia.  I am glad they got it in the neck.  But I believe it means the end of Leave.Heard a faint rumour today of our next move.  Apparently three places to be attacked simultaneously, Infantry to attack Bir Saba & also Gaza & mounted troops to attack some place further south.  The 1st Reg. came in here yesterday, the Yeomanry taking over their camp.We did not go out there after all.
