<p>16th June 1917.<br/>Ambulance move off at 10 a.m. board the train &amp; arrive at ---- at 2 p.m. The trip was delightful the country we passed through was delightful. March to<br/>a distance of 3 miles or more,  rather severe in the heat of the day carrying packs etc.  The surrounding country is magnificent,  words cannot describe the splendour of it. The cultivation of the land is wonderful too. Met Albert Whipp,  he is now a Lieut. in  one of the Battalions, also came across Harry Crowdice, he was a constant visitor at the Balmoral Dances. We will now have a certain amount of training to do here &amp; indulge in plenty of sport.</p>
