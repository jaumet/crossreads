Chess tournament last night at the Y.M.C.A. I run straight through into the final. The final will be played tonight. Madame used to pay 25 Francs for 1000 kgrms of Good coal during the war. Now she has to pay 100 Francs per 1000 kgms (a little more than a ton).
29-3, Saturday
Won the Tournament. Miss Prior is now after my scalp, made me promise to play her a couple of Games this Evening. She took a Party of us around the Glass works this morning, it was a very interesting show. A heavy fall of snow early this morning 3 or 4 Inches, everything was terribly sloppy because it started thawing as soon as it fell. Seen the Doctor and got paid 10.30 A.M. The Doctor took no chances with me, gave me a very rough overhaul. One chap (A Coy.) came a "Gutser" to his very great surprise. He admitted having slipped but was quite certain that he was O.K. again. Beat M.M.P. (Miss Murray-Prior) at Chess in the evening also two other chaps who seemed to think I "Fluked" a win over them in the Tournament. These two fellows were much below M.M.P's standard.
31-3, Sunday
Paraded at B.O.R. at 7.30 A.M. with the Aussie Draft. Some Mademoiselles there were flashing their Hankies every now then pretending to Cry. At the station I met some of the 10/17 who are going back with us. As we started to entrain and also later when the train started the French women kids cried in real earnest especially when the Band played Good-byee because they know this song.
