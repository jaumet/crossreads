<p>19 September 1916 Tues<br/>Still raining &amp; like my bad luck I struck gas picquet lasting 8 hours. Went with [indecipherable] over to the Royal Fusiliers Canteen &amp; handed in the chip for 2 bottles. I finished up by feeling very groggy when I went on duty at 9 pm [indecipherable] very full in the mud.</p>
<p>20 September 1916 Wed<br/>Gas drill at 6 p.m. by Sgt Bell who had a few across his chest. Mr. Sutton filled one of my teeth. Tucker very crook. Several aeroplanes about all day. Had tea at an old estaminet in Valmertinghe.</p>
