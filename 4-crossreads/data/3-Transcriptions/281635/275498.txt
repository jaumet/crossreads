<p>around. Bought ppcards &amp; 2 books of views of Hull &amp; posted letters top Mother &amp; Amanda Cowling. Saw the monumental columns again &amp; found it was to Wilberforce in connection with the abolition of slavery. Caught a train at 11am &amp; travelled via Beverly, Driffield, Bridlington, Flamborough to Filey &amp; walked out to Muston arriving about 2pm. Uncle Will is away (they have sent for him) but Auntie &amp; Ida were home. Hull is a very nice clean city &amp; Bridlington seems a fine town. Saw Flamborough Head. Went to bed 9pm.<br/>5/10/18 Slept like a top in a lovely bed. After breakfast walked into Filey &amp; had a look around. Bought views</p>
