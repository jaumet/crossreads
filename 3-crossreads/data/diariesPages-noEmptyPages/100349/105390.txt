Very cold day. Were releived and went out via Delville Wood and Langueval to "Brisbane Camp" near Bazentin; or what is left of it. Will camp here for the night in Bow Huts. The slush was freezing underfoot today.

Saw Roy Lennon today, where he was working on the stone dump I must have been unutterably filthy for even he remarked that I had some mud on myself. Left "Brisbane Camp" and got a ride on a train as far as Meaulte; then we marched beside the Ancre as far as Ribemont. Went into good billets. Not a bad village this. Went to the bathhouse, and had a good bath and a change. Wonderfully refreshing makes one feel like a little rainwashed daisy.
