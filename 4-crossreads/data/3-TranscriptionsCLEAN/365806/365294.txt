  
 4 effect were taken by the majority as mere exaggerations made for political purposes. 
 I had a slight illness the other day, had to go into hospital, came before a medical Board, & was offered a commission.  However, an interview with General Monash & General Howse put the thing right, & I go to France.  Leslie Williams, who was doing my work while I was away, gets the commission - under Lance Addison.  Lockhart has been in England on leave very fit & well.
