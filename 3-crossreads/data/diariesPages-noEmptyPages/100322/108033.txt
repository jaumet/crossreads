Paris
before returning to hotel to pack up. With about 5000 a year Paris would be a delight ? the home of the wealthy. Rested and read until about 6.30 p.m. and then paid my bill and got myself and baggage put on a taxi for the Gare de L?Est. Took what will probably be the last look for a long time at the Opera and all the other old familiar places. Reached Gare de L?Est and got a place for Strassbourg. The carriage of this train (and many others now) was German and bore the Imperial arms. On French lines there now seems to be abundance of Hun material. The carriage splendidly comfortable and each passenger has much more sitting space than other nations seem to give. Latrine other arrangements all seem good. Each ?place" gives ample room only 2 on each side of the carriage. 2 French Majors A.F.C. Lt. as companions.
