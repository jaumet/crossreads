 NOV.   FRIDAY 24   1916 
 Fine but cold. I was much better & was exercising horses all the morning & I got my pass after dinner & got a car to Salisbury. Got to London about 8 pm the train being over an hour late so I missed Poss & Kieth Moses. Could not get a room at the Regents Palace so stayed at Cox's hotel for the night.
