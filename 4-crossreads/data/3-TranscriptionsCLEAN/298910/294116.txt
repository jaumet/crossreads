No Artillery firing only machine guns & rifles - very quiet behind the lines just as tho no war at all were on. Started evacuating from Bapaume to 6th Fld Amb at Pozieres by motor car service. A Zepplein reported brought down by gun fire at daylight near Amiens. 2 others escaped - heard they made a raid on Kent, England.
Monday  19/3/17
Cold & strong wind blowing - but fine. Went for a cruise about over the country that we have just gained. Perhaps no pen will ever tell of the hardships - of the tenacity of the dash - of the mud - of the filth of the last trench, before Fritz pushed off - what a Hell the last No Mans Land is - Germans & Australians lay there in hundreds - saw a Captain hung up on the entanglements - also a Lance Corporal who had died but not without his victim, who lay alongside him - Many souvenirs in the nature of Photos, post cards, etc were offering but as the weather had a bad effect on that class of staff, I preferred to leave it all alone.
