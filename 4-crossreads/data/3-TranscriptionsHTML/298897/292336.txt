<p>did not reach our destination until too late to buy anything. It also prevented me from getting back in time for roll call but  that did not matter much altho' next day the major, jokingly asked me what I was joy riding round the country for.</p>
<p>Wednesday 2nd August<br/>My day off.  Went into "Estairs" in the afternoon in a 'Ford' &amp; had to wait all the afternoon while it was being repaired.  The mechanics were not much class &amp; did not know much about the car, the vast expansion of the motor traffic being responsible for a shortage of good men.  Coming back I drove myself this being a treat indeed &amp; the first time for about 12 months</p>
<p>Thursday 2nd August<br/>Orderly Sgt for the day with plenty of work as the place was to be inspected by General Sir Alexander Godley.  I kept the chaps at it until all was spick &amp; span the verdict of the General being, splendid.  He must have <strike>have</strike> been in a good humour as he was most affable throughout the inspection.  Had a half holiday during the afternoon so managed to get a few letters written</p>
