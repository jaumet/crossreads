Pottering about a Camp is enough to drive a man to drink. After Tea I went for a stroll into the village. The country round here is very pretty. Beautiful shady woods and lanes.

The W.O. told a chap named Biddle, and I to report for duty to the Dentist's place. I am pottering around in the workshop making false teeth, and Biddle (3 F. Amb) is working in the vulcanising room. We get a pass any day we like so I went to the Sports after Dinner and from there on to Le Havre. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saw about 2000 Yanks march from the Boat to the Train on their way to the Line, and very well they looked. They carry very awkward looking packs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sun 22. <br>\r\nRaining again. Did about an hours work at the Dental Hospital and got another pass to the City. Had Tea at Y.M. There are plenty of Yanks in the City and they seem a very decent crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mon 23. <br>\r\nCold, wet day. Busy time at Dentists. They turn teeth out just like a butcher turning out sausages. It's a pretty constant Job.
