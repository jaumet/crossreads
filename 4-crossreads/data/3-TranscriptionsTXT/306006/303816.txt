12-4-17arrived at out destination at 3 oclock & took over from a yeomanry Brigade & the Regts split up, a squadron at each post about a mile apart & are digging trenches. I ran a phone line to A Sqdn as soon as I arrived & had a lively time doing it as Roger is very lively. I then ran one to C Sqdn & we were linked up everywhere in a very short time. A good many mud buildings are scattered about here these are now deserted, & are the home of "cockies" the country is undulating & practically the whole of it is under cultivation & our horses are having an exceptionally good time in consequence, a good many motor cars (armoured & otherwise) are flying about this part of the world; We met some tommies bringing in a captured Turk.
