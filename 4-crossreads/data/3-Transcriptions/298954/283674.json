<p>1918<br/>Sat. 31st Aug (cont.)<br/>Smithy inserted me into a smart (at a distance) green gown, a gorgeous but not overdone complexion, a beauty spot, much borrowed jewellery (I ransacked the camp for bracelets etc.) and a blonde triumph fresh from the hands of our coiffeur (a pre-war Parisian ladies coiffeur.)   In the second act "dressing-room scene" I waited with knees knocking together for my cue;  I didn't see a face in the auditorium &ndash; the conductor's chair was my limit of vision for quite half an hour whilst I waddled about and imitated Muriel Starr.<br/>Our "figures" are funny (or rather their making);  with the aid of several pairs of tightly wound puttees, a few old rags &amp; a scarf or two one attains Kellerman-like perfection.</p>
<p>Our "Dear Little Cottage" song was not bad, but could have been better.<br/>Williams and Limb in "Everywhere I go" were a bit slushy.   "Lies" went splendidly.   Newlbe should be George Robey instead a blue jacket.</p>
<p>In the 3rd Act (Freeman's flat) I made up as a peroxided 50 year old wreck of the "chorus dame" &ndash; a London landlady with a Past.</p>
