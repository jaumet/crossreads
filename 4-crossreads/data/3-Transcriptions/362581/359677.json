<p>17.6.17<br/>Dearest Eddy,</p>
<p>Have heard that you   &amp;  Mummie had a holiday   &amp;  stayed with Auntie Annie at Talbot. How did you enjoy it! Had some fun, I guess. Hope you are well   &amp;  strong now also going to school. We are having warm weather now but it is lovely after the cold weather. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses  From  Auntie Eadle.</p>
