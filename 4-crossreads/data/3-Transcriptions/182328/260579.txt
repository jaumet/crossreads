<p>own hot water plant. The baths themselves are big&nbsp;copper holders, about one yard square and nine inches deep, set in cement. These are quite useful and the men wash their clothes in them too. The warm water is used a great deal, as the other is exceptionally cold here now and if it is like this in summer, the winter water must be just next to ice. The Hospital and dispensary are nice airy buildings, specially the former which consists of one long large ward and the necessary attachments. It is small because of the big base hospitals for Australians at Tidsmouth, only 4 miles away, which serves for all the Camps round about for serious cases. Parkhouse is divided into 4 Camps, N<sup>os</sup> 1 . 2&nbsp;. 3 . 4, and ours is N<sup>o </sup>2 for Army Medical Details, in charge of Lieut Colonel Purdie. Each camp is almost complete in itself and has its own supplies of coal etc and the usual stores. All along the huts, which run in rows like streets, are wooden gratings and footpaths for wet weather, another Comfort for the men. There is a big hot air drying room for wet bedding, blankets, clothes etc. The usual little shops are close by and the YMCA people have two large huts for the men.</p>
