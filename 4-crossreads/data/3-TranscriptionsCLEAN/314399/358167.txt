Rain cleared in the afternoon & Violet, Janet & I cycled to Dunoon. Had an ice & bought some cakes & then came home. Went to Blairmore & saw the village maid (she isn't all there). 
 Friday 20 June 1919 Fine for a while so we started for Loch Lomond. Had to change boats at Kilcraggen & then to a train at Craigendoran We missed the train at 11 am & had to wait till 1.30 pm. So went into Helensburg & had lunch. got the train at Craigendoran at 1.30 & went to Arrochar & from there walked to Tarbett. The train trip was goodo. Beautiful scenery. Came right along two Lochs. Loch Loy & Gare Loch. Missed the boat at Tarbett so went for a walk along the banks of Loch Lomond. Very nice indeed. Got the train back & had to wait 1 1/2 hours at Criagendoran again. got a boat home tho. Had a most enjoyable day. Do me everytime. It rained very heavily all the morning but was nice and warm after lunch.
