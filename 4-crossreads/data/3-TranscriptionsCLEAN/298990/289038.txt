  
 Ypres 17/10/16 Up early and breakfasted and then walked out through Lille Gate to the railway dugouts.  The thick ramparts have  a breach in them here and a stone causeway runs across a broad and deep moat full of water. The country is then for some distance of a marshy nature and covered with bulrushes.  A good many brass hats were about.  A wet slippery walk across the fields but the day is a lovely one.  Reached 24th H.Q. and found Watson  returned so we sat as a court martial and dealt with 3 cases. Returned before lunch.  Just near the railway is a very full cemetery - the neat white crosses grouped as close together as it is possible to pack them.  Some acres of dead men.  Further on, almost hidden by grass was a smaller plot of rude unpainted crosses rotting into the tall grass.  In a dirty dingy farm outhouse were a number of duckboards and a notice over the door "Brigade Mortuary". Lying on one of the boards was a shapeless blanket shrouded body, all sewn up ready for burial.  One of the boys - his day's work over and a cipher from the military standpoint, no further use to the army.  Our guns in rear of the town were putting over heavy stuff some miles across and I stopped, listening to slow methodical whining progress of the shell.  The enemy was also planting some fair sized stuff into the town and knocked down some more of one of the towers.  This has been a fair and smiling city but now it is a stricken waste.  Furphies are becoming  substantiated and orders now commence to materialise.  Major Hugo Flecker A.A.MC has reported to relieve James to go on leave. Carl Thomsen left tonight for the Flying Corps and spent the evening in with me.  What a great brotherly feeling there is between all we old Yarra Borderers.  Only 3 of us left in the Regiment now.  Poor old Bert, Hughie, Biggsley, Percy Collins[?] Dangerfield & Retchford dead and others wounded.  Raining tonight.
