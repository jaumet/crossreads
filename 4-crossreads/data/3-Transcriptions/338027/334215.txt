<p>Sunday, 25 July, 1915<br/>A big party of us went over to the break water for a swim found that it was a favourite mixed bathing resort on a Sunday morning so we had a good time.  It is now settled that The Clan is to be a permanent Hospital boat and they commence painting her to-morrow.  Two of our late sisters rowed over to see us they are at 21 General and are going on to the Dunluce Castle.</p>
<p>There was a smart bit of work by the Austs at Gaba Tepe a party of Turks attacked &amp; were defeated in twenty minutes &ndash; 49 killed.</p>
<p>Monday, 26 July, 1915<br/>Well it is settled at last and the boat is to be a permanent hospital ship for they commenced painting her white this morning.  We rec. a small advance of money on our due and I went ashore &amp; had the most enjoyable day I have yet had in Alex.  I met my two swimming French friends and went to their beautiful home then I met an old Cairo Egyptian friend and he insisted on taking me to his harem.  I finished up at the Casino where six bonny English girls were playing.  Did not arrive home until small hrs of the morn.</p>
