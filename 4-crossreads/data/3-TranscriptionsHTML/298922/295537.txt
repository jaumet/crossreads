<p>Wednesday 15 August 1917</p>
<p>Big fighting is going on in France, "How long Mighty Father, How long". <strike>I feel ashamed of myself not wanting to return to the front still it has to be did &amp; this time next week I expect to be back.</strike></p>
<p>The expense of this place is borne entirely by the Red X &amp; they treat us very well indeed equal to any first class Hotel, with a Bathing Box &amp; Motor rides only not much liberty is granted &amp; all officers must be in to dinner at night.</p>
