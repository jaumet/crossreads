26 Aug, 1916And then he reached Et MalerAnd started his advanceBut found against AustraliaHe had no ------ chance.
He thought that with his riflesHe would easily get throughBut found that these were triflesTo old Man Kangaroo.
He brought up reinforcementsAnd snipers by the scoreBut found this to his loss meantOur rifles spoke the more.
He tried to get around us,But here he tried in vainAnd very soon he found usIn front of him again.
He cried out allah! allah!As through him cold steeled searedBut discretion more than valorSo Allah disappeared.
And Abdul taking AllahAs leader good & trueHe also did a 'yallah'From the wily Kangaroo.
