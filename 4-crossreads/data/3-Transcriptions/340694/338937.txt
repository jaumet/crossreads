<p>11-10-16<br/>Had some great games of cards last night. Geo. Veitch came down &amp; the Skipper joined in &amp; with the W.O. made a four hander.</p>
<p>Things are very quiet on this front no excitement at all lately, not even mail to break the monotony.</p>
<p>Am a constant visitor across the road for coffee, they are very nice folk. The only lad has just turned 18 &amp; he left this morning to join the Army. His mother is very much cut up so is Juliette, he was a nice lad.</p>
