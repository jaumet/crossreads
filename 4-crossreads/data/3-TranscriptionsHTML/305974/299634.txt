<p>31 Monday<br/>I don't think I mentioned before that pennies &amp; half-pennies are in great circulation here 3d pieces being practically extinct.  We do an hours physical drill before breakfast now, which at first <strike>seems</strike> was very fatiguing.  Stretcher drill indulged in in the morning, &amp; we were informed to prepare ourselves for a big route march in the afternoon, but we didn't go very far  when we had over an hours spell &amp; then returned.</p>
<p>1 August  Tuesday<br/>The weather now is beginning to get very hot a bath during the evening is a refreshing luxury indulged in by a great number.  We have a very boozy mob in the hut now. <strike>very seldom</strike> it is a rare occasion for some to come home sober.  Today was the first time I have attended a lecture since leaving Aust  Went on sick parade for dental reason in the morning</p>
<p>2 Wednesday<br/>Doing stretcher drill all the morning &amp; went on a route match during the afternoon.  Stretcher drill being given so frequently is getting intolerable to all, but the route marches are liked much better, we only go about half a mile &amp; lay down in the shade of a large hedge until it is time to come back.</p>
