evening we had a mock trial of the Editor of our paper, a matter of libel. It was the best & longest laugh I have had for months. Ellis & Billy were witnesses for the plaintiff. The plaintiff gained a verdict of 1/4  damages & costs.
I once said that I could go without meat. It is now over a week & I have not had a taste of meat.
We are to have "High Jinks" tomorrow as we cross the line early in the morning. At 5 o/c this afternoon we were exactly half-way between Fremantle & Suez.
I have physical drill & stretcher drill every morning & French lessons twice a day & bandaging at night between 7 & 8.
