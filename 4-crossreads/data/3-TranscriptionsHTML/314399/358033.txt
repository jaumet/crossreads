<p>Wednesday 5 February 1919<br/>Snowed last night &amp; part of the morning. Very heavy too.</p>
<p>Thursday 6 February 1919<br/>Very cold again. Everything frozen. Got a job of walking to Harfleur see all diggers saluted &amp; were properly dressed etc  None saluted as usual but sad to say I didn't correct them. Went straight into Havre.</p>
