The fruit season is in now, & my word it is something to remember- strawberries, absolutely some of the finest I have ever tasted- these price at from 3d to 6d per lb   Cherries are fine too & range from 4 to 7d per lb.Other fruits are dear especially apples, & peaches, generally about 7/6 per dozen.  Needless to say I haven't tasted any of these, this season.The weather has been very changeable lately & not a bit like summer.  The past fortnight has been very chilly during the evening & we have had far over the average rainfall.  As I write at present the rain is tearing down ceaselessly & the wind howling reminds one of the winter evenings.Another raid by German 'planes today.  We are getting quite used to them over in these parts now.I am keeping well & am looking forward to getting some good, useful work in when my transfer is finally settled.Until further notice please address No. 6359 Dvr J.L.W  c/0 H. Hammond Esq.  No5, Matham Grove,  East Dulwich London, S.E. 22.Must close now with love to all at "Cairnleith"Your loving sonJ Leo L. Waterhouse
