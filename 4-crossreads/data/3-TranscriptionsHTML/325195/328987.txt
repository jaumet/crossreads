<p>30.10.15<br/>Sat 30th<br/>Another fine, warm day &amp; not a cloud to be seen; I saw Claude Lambert tonight while coming on duty &amp; had a long yarn with him; Our trenches &amp; the Turks on Walkers Ridge are only ten yards apart now &amp;  tonight the Turks have been very busy throwing very powerful bombs wounding several lads  The heads on Walkers appeared frightened &amp; rang up the Artillery asking if they could get their support if required; A message was sent to all the Regiments at 8 oclock tonight saying a Turkish Officer was expected to surrender tonight, &amp; that he was to be well treated &amp; subjected to no inconvenience &amp; sent to Divisional HQ  I suppose he is one of our spies</p>
