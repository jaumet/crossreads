<p>Your letters are here three days under the month or exactly 27 days from your writing, those from Doffie &amp; Maggie were written on the 17th March which makes the delivery to me with the lapse of but twenty five days.</p>
<p>No date plums here, though they should flourish in this climate.  Must look for them.  Glad you like the stamps &amp; newspaper cuttings.  Shall expect the photographs.</p>
<p>My regards to Mr Fitzgerald.  It is pleasing that he and Mr Titheradge were interested in my remarks about this part of the world.</p>
<p>Mr Travers is a thoughtful man.  I like him.</p>
<p>Kitty appears to be in demand with the fiddle.  Has she practised lately?  Clever girl.</p>
<p>What a giddy girl Maria is to desire to go to the pictures.  Cheered you both up no doubt.</p>
<p>Rain is always welcome in Sydney.  Here no one thinks of rain except as a phenomenon, as a matter of fact when a shower comes everyone fears to be wet, each wraps up in a most wonderful manner, for weeks after the falling water is a subject for general conversation.  It makes me laugh.  Holman's holidays save him, or rather have saved him much trouble, several times, but it is <strike>likely</strike> probable that he will overdo it, then there will be the long &amp; expected disruption in the party; the result of which 'tis not easy to foresee.</p>
<p>Weston has not replied to my letter addressed to "The Orsova, Suez".  Sorry the idea did not occur to me, because a trip to the Canal could have been easily arranged.  Let us hope that the ship will dodge all the submarines between Port Said &amp; London.  Should I get to London I hope to see Mary &amp; Nellie Johnson.</p>
<p>Dick Arthurs suggestion to call on Barr Brown about the rooms was a good one.</p>
<p>My best wishes to the Bridges &amp; Macdonalds.</p>
