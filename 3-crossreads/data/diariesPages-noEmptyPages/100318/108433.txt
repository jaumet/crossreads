Edinburgh
After breakfast walked with Col Craig through the gardens fronting Abercromby Place and down to Princes Street where gardens commence just about where Scotts monument is. The old town and the castle are perched up on steep severe and rocky crags. Went up to the Westport and saw the scene of the Porteus riots and the Grassmarket. Crowds of kiddies playing about all barefooted and talking such broad Scotch that one could hardly understand a word of their talk. From here to the Food Office where the Colonel wanted to fix up some business and we then walked to the Trongate passing the medical schools and the Royal College of Surgeons. All the shops round here are full of books and surgical requisites. We went into the courtyard of the University
