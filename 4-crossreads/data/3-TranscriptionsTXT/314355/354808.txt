 May 20 151. "The Queen's Room" scene from Chastelard would be great in sepia and Blue in vellum, in the manner of the old parchment book I found yesterday, three other great parchment covered tomes of stiff tough paper, in manuscript, and near a hundred smaller phamphlet books &ndash; all about the 17 and early 18th Centuary are scattered amongst debris of broken boxes and tiles of the attack of the Cure's house.   "The Golden Asse" [Ass] would be wounderful in this manner. 
 Now with the two engravings of Armentieres, this parchment book is strapped in waterproofing, and till I can carry it to England I'll have to carry it without seeing it, the engravings as soon as we're back I'll try and send along to Mrs. H. 
 152. A 2nd M.Gunner in early before breakfast, and he full of good tellings:  his wound a through and through shell fragment of R.Am., down to square the M.O. to let him stay on duty. 
 The impression he gives of the first arriving here and advancing from Hazebruck [Hazebrouck] &ndash; of a travelling forward against stragglers and retreaters and refugees, of arriving by Nieppe Wood, and establishing posts, and an evacuating with no flanks, of evacuating their guns mounted on froggie barrows, along roads flanked at intervals by hospitable estaminets, of posts temporarily established by them, and a general skirmishing of all Flanders.  Then more "Tales of The Tommies" &hellip; 
 153. p.m. midnight. A second drawing of the back page of "Ghutz".  Basil promised yesterday to compleat it, and today had a mood for playing.  The day hot for sleeping, so tried my hand at printing, and tonight had to draw out another slate.  A. Bearers up to relieve B.  All the afternoon the first wearing this year of shorts lying in the sun. 
 Mail, letter from C.W. Beaumont of shortly sending along "Tale of Igor", "The Little School" and "Raptures". 
 May 21 154. a.m. Gas shelling over the 1st Batt. and its effect strange.  Am bad, terribly delirious, with none of the old gas symptoms:  all others comparatively light, only cordite the smell in the air, but gas heavily [indecipherable] with 5.9 H.E. 
 Pradelles heavily shelled during the night. 
 11 a.m. A barrage over the railway below us, and the road to H.Q.
