At 2 o'clock in the afternoon we were granted leave for the purpose of visiting the City of Capetown.  We first went on a march under discipline and returned to nearly the same spot as we left, and were dismissed to go wherever we chose, in or around the outskirts of the City, excepting the blacks' quarters which were forbidden to troops as out of bounds.  We had a most interesting day as we had visited the principal gardens, the Museum, and all the important Public Buildings.  I might mention that the Museum was particularly interesting in that it had a model of each of the African Black Races, in both male and female types; they were all of a different colour or shade in brown or black and had different pronounced characteristics in their physique.  Then again Africa is noted for its many wild animals, and the Museum has a good collection of each species.
The gardens are very well kept there, and are worth inspection, especially to Australians, as there are a good number of plants, flowers and shrubs which are not grown here. In the gardens just opposite the end of the main street of the City is the statue of Cecil Rhodes, the great founder of the Mining industry in the Cape Colony.
The population of Cape Town consists of many races including Malays, Russians, different breeds of Blacks, Jews, Boers, and a few British, comprising mostly, Englishmen.  The Jews seem to be mostly in the way of jewellers, tobacconists, drapers, and curio shops, while the coloured races do most of the rough work and unskilled labor.  The Britishers hold a good social rank among the population, as they generally hold high positions in almost every sphere of occupation.
On the next three days in which we spent there, we visited some of the outer suburbs by electric tram and by train seeing all the beaches and mountains that can be seen from a tower in the City itself.  One of the most interesting mountains was the Table Mountain on which we gathered silver leaves on our way to the top, which is flat as a table, hence its name.  Another range of hills called the Twelve Apostles with the Lions Head at the further end from the City, was well worth visiting.
