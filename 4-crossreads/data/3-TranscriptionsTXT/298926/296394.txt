Its very well to talk about the glory of the warAnd read about the trenches in your booksIt kind of interests you, that's the picture or the sketchOr a photograph you say "How fine it looks"
But stay behind that picture there is much that lies concealedThat escapes the passing glances of the fewWho scan with idle interest just to while away the hourBut say lads "What's it mean to me and you"
It does not show the tired minds that cry aloud for rest                                    And eyes droop protesting Nature's claim
