 "Boy" at the Adelphi tonight. 
 Went early to Laura's Hospital &amp; took her some Carnations &ndash; 6 Pink, 6 White &ndash; cost 5/-!!!, give you an idea of value here. 
 Laura could talk but her throat was sore. Met Brace &amp; young Charlie at Liverpool Railway Station &amp; went theatre tonight with Dolly &ndash; as you must think am not saving much L.S.D.
