<p>1/9/15  Scotian<br/>To the tune of "Three cheers for the Red White and Blue" they sing a song with a refrain "If the odd numbers don't mark time two paces How the hell can the boys form platoon".  Made arrangement for issue of 150 rounds and an iron ration to every man and had 3500 rounds belted up for our machine guns.  Some of our English officer passengers again "well oiled" tonight. One hiccuped "Bai Jove, you know, 'twould be a terrible thing to be torpedoed while you're drunk don't 'cher know!"</p>
<p>10 pm<br/>Darkness everywhere on deck.  All ports screened with blankets and screens of all kind.  We are still passing among islands.</p>
<p>2/9/15<br/>Fresh sea wet decks.  Issuing ammunition and rations to excited men all chattering for they think they realise war's reality at last.  Each man as he gets his allowance of s.a.a. goes into a corner by himself just like a dog</p>
