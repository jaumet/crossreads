<p>Some sweeping changes are taking place in the Regiment. Colonel Glasgow the Commanding Officer is going away to a higher command he certainly has proved his worth on the Peninsular as a good soldier and a born leader of men. We are all glad in a way to see him go up the ladder of fame but very sorry to think he is going away from the Regiment. From now on it will be a totally different 2nd Light Horse Regiment from the old original one. Our Regimental Sergeant Major MY Wasson. a magnificent type of soldier and a most highly principled man has now got the Star and he becomes a second Lieutenant we have no one in the Regiment to fill his place no one fit to take the position and in him going away we have sustained a serious loss</p>
