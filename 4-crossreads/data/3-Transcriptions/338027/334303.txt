<p>for generations this scene had for a background the beautiful blue of the Aegean Sea and beyond were a line of long rugged hills, then as if part of the play their came out of the cottage a girl with a water jar on her head and I was wonder struck for she was the possessor of the most beautiful face I have ever seen, such a face that seemed in harmony with the beauty of the surroundings it was a glorious beauty expression and shape her costume only showed her beauty to advantage, yet if you took this lovely picture out of its frame, it would be spoilt.  I am always a lover of beauty and this night I felt inspired to write as my soul directed, but my poetical reverie was soon lost when I rejoined my companions at the camp &ndash; often I feel as if I can write some thing that will make me famous then &ndash; oblivion.</p>
