<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>The Gap in letters now means that I am rushing my work and am naturally unsettled by the nearness of my release.  Health on the whole pretty good though it is difficult to get the right kind of food up here and I am forced to eat at the French Club, Ismalia to get soft grub.  I still swim a little &amp; feel the benefit of it.  Everything is closing up here &amp; there is a beastly left behind feeling about us all.  I am going to wind up in Cairo &amp; try &amp; get away in three weeks from now, not a long wait.</p>
<p>In the meantime I can only worry about my work &amp; look forward almost with trembling anxiety for our meeting.</p>
<p>I had a nice motor drive last night to Ferry port &amp; this afternoon I give myself "leave" &amp; go into Ismalia for a sketch of the Sweet Water canal.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
