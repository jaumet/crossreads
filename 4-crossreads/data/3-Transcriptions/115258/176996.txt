<p>awful destruction and havock wrought in the retiring turkish army by our low flying planes. Es Salt is a fair sized town, built on both sides of a gully with the road running right along the bottom of the gully and turks after hurrying back all night had tried to hide themselves with their guns and transport in the town during daylight, but our planes must have seen them there and swooped right down on to them, because the streets of the town and all the road leading out of it was strewn with broken transport and gear and dead mules and horses and Germans and turks everywhere - we had quite a job to get along the road, so thick was the debris. it was the same at the Sacassion village we camped near on the night of the 24th.</p>
