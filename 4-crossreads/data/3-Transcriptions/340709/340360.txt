<p>33<br/>knows Albert by sight. He is a little black piece of humanity about 24 inches long and he lives with his mother a short distance along our street. To my knowledge he has never been guilty of wearing a stitch of clothing, and he plays about in front of his residence the whole day. Should an officer pass down the street Albert leaves his play and stands solemnly at the salute. The officer is careful to make no friendly advances - Albert wouldn't stand that; he would be off like a shot to his mummy. Over at Grajat there are two children, Germans, named Blumm; the elder, Willie, being 6 years, the younger, Freda, 5. Our conversation with them is rather limited owing to our very meagre knowledge of German &amp; their equally meagre stock of English. They have now, however, changed their "Auf Weiderschen" to "Good Bye" &amp; their "yah" to "yes", which is encouraging. They will always come to see us off when we are leaving, &amp; squat on the side of the hill waving their little hands frantically till we are out of sight. Dear little kiddies &ndash; friends of the enemy.<br/>Thurs 15th : Another routine day; repairing boats; fitting out the "Penguin"; &amp; generally straightening up. About 8 o'clock tonight one of the Police reported that signals were being made from Commonwealth Bay to a point on the opposite side of the harbour. We took a few men in our No. 4 boat &amp; quietly dropped down towards the Bay where we remained drifting for about an hour. Nothing transpired &amp; we returned to the Depot satisfied that the Police were mistaken.<br/>Fri 16th : This afternoon we took the "Ramu" to Sian Bay Plantation in search of boats. We found 2 (whalers). As we were on the look-out for smaller craft we passed these over, though they have been noted for future occasions</p>
