<p>Friday 3 August 1917</p>
<p>No. 14 A.G.H. Here I am same old place as landed in this time last year, don't worry as only means a spell.</p>
<p>Before leaving Brigade Head Quarters I saw a good spider fight &ndash; Great big TARANTULA much bigger &amp; fiercer than the Australian sort. Are put in a TIN WASH TUB &amp; in 7 minutes one or the other is Killed. The 6th Reg. beat B.H.Q. but ours is undefeated now. He can eat a cricket at a sitting &ndash; the prize is a case of Beer.</p>
