Took rations and marched to a place called "Berke". A very long march. More Australian mail today. Leuit Lacy is now O.C. of the Company.

Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig; Commander-in-Chief of the Army in France; visited us today and made a hurried inspection. He is a smart figure of a man; though rather small in statue. There were an enormous number of troops at the "Bull Ring" when he came.
