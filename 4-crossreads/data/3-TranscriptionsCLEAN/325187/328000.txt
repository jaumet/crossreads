  
 [Thursday 14 September 1916] 
 With Dorothy.  Rang up Sir George Reid, Lady Reid asked me to dinner but I'm not going anywhere at night at all.  Just going along quietly. Not much sunshine & the days are short. I will send you a Cable if & when I get married. What a heap of letters must be following me up when they do come, I'll have quite an interesting day reading them all.
