<p>Friday 12<br/>Life is sweet when sweetness is on the menu, out here its slow, sour, stuffy and sad<br/>Saturday 13<br/>Believe me I'm looking for a war but I guess and calculate there's no war on about T.E.K<br/>Sunday 14<br/>575 art though weary art though languid<br/>575 dear brethryn let us sing<br/>In Cairo again beastly place</p>
