 Tuesday May 13.1919. 183 A beautiful morning. Early this morning Kangaroo Island was plainly visible on the starboard bow. After breakfast we were abreast of it and quite close to the shore. It was the first glimpse of Australia that we had seen in years and the sight was a pleasant one and awoke many memories of former years. Kangaroo Island is a large one, and very fertile. At 9.30 on the port side we could see other islands standing high out of the sea ne of which had a lighthouse on it.
