  
 Wed 5th June (cont.) Spend the afternoon lounging, sleeping, & so forth. 
 Do without afternoon tea today, being lazy, and at 5 pm serve up. Fried bacon (a thin shaving each.) Fried bread. Bread with treacle or dripping. Cocoa ( with  milk & sugar) 
 These luxuries are not always served.   We either play or watch football from 7.30 to 9.30 p.   More cocoa at 10 p & a walk round our odorous lake telling each other our sorrows beings us one day nearer "Holland or home." 
 Thu. 13th June. A big explosion at the Meser (munition factory) about six miles away across the river. 
 Swimming parties were taken out today for a swim in the river.   I went, of course. 
 Sat. 15th June. About 30 English "tommies" arrived today from East Prussia. 
 Poor devils!   Gaunt, hungry, filthy, & in rags. 
 Today is bath day, an Event of fortnightly occurrence.
