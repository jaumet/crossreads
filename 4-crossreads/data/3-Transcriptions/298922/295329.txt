<p>Still cold &amp; wet. I have plenty of Kit if a man can carry it that is the trouble.<br/>We are off again on another stunt in 12 hours &ndash; but hear the infantry are to be given a chance of some fighting this time.</p>
<p>Two A.S.C. men were killed by bombs yesterday. My house of Bags, oil sheet &amp; blankets lets in the wet but I don't take off any clothing you may be sure &amp; we had a Rum issue last night.</p>
