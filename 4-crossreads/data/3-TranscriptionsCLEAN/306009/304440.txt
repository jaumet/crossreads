Changed there for Montazeh where arrived at 4 p.m.  Journey from Cairo to Sidi Gaba uneventful - line passing between well irrigated fields of waving corn , & cotton bushes.  Between Sidi Gaba & Montazeh passed numerous fruit laden date palms & fig trees, Australian camp with horse lines, & a camp of French Troops. I hope to have a good time at the Conval. Depot. It is a big building right on the ocean, on the coast west of Alexandria.
