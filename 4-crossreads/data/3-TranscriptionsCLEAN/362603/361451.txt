7.  now & it is not likely that Our new C.O. who is a full Colonel is going to let His N.C.O's go away.  He is a clever Doctor & good disciplinarian & a N. S. Welshman so He is no fool.Major Grigor our first M.O. & our late C.O. is still with us but is now a Temporary Lieut-Colonel, a rank that He should rightly have had 12 months ago.  Oh Don't worry about Us as for cold or food.  We have a lovely room & the Tucker is much better than we got in Egypt.We have a Home from Home & I see no reason why we should not be here as long as we like to stay here.I am glad Bess can visit you occasionally.
