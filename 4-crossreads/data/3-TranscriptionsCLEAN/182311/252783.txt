 Bustard Trenches, 
  Somewhere in England . 
 October 4th 1916. 
 My Dear Ones, 
    This is just a few lines written from trenches, where we have dug, fought, slid, swum, splashed and been soaked through and through, and still enjoy the joke; today I've had a bit of a spell, and the first shave for three days.  We have lived under Active Service con-ditions here, worked the trenches by day and by night, fought an attak, dug hasty trenches and then retired from their counter attack and found the work very interesting.  I'll write at length on Sunday, for the present, all love 
    Harold.

 My Dear Ones, 
    This is Saturday, cold and bleak, the others have gone into Salisbury but I'm in my hut, I've just finished three hours work on my Lewis Gun School Note Book and now feel free to write to you, I havefinished work and now can take my recreation. 
    I am attending a local school on the new machine gun, and am anxious to get a first classpass.  Did I tell you that I qualified at the Ranging Course at Hayling, that was the ony standard and I believe I got very nearly the possible marks.
