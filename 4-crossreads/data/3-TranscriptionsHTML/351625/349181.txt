<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>Just a short letter to you on the eve of our departure for France although before you get this letter you will know we are there as we will cable to you in the meantime.  I told you in some previous letter of our putting in for a transfer to the 17 Batt. well the transfer has gone through &amp; we are going to form the seventeenth in France.  We were hoping to get sent to the 17 Batt. training depot in England if our transfer had come through in time then we would most likely have spent Christmas in England, but such was not our luck as we were on draft to join the 2nd when it came through so we have been left on draft but will form up the 17th instead of the 2nd.  Yesterday afternoon</p>
