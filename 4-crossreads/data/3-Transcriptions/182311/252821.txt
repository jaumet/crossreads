<p>DEAR PEOPLE,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve so much to write of, but so little that I may tell, however, your Harold has again been well in the thick of things and has again returned with a story that is well worth hearing, but one that I may not tell with any detail here, here are a few facts:&nbsp; I&#39;ve been over the para-pet again on a raid and one which received black headlines in &quot;The Times&quot; so you will see that it was of great import-ance, although my party&#39;s entry was foiled by wire and other obstacles, one of the three parties entered and did splendid work.&nbsp; Lieut <s>S</s>Fleighter <sub>^</sub><sup>39th Bn A.I.F.</sup> who lives in Vic.Avenue was trium-phantly brave and daring and will/I&#39;m sure be honoured for it; I expect he will earn the M.C., and he deserves it too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to be able to write this and perhaps my Dad will know his and I would be glad if he told him how well he behaved, coming out of it too without a scratch, though our casualties were by no means light.&nbsp; However, enough of shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;Bendigonian&quot; I see has printed the photos that I send them of my platoon and &quot;Life on a Transport&quot; they have enlarged them somewhat and so lost some of their definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sending you when they arrive, a set of cuttings from the English papers of the account of our little joke on the Germans, I&#39;m feeling too cold tonight to sit and write for long, for we have had a solid freeze</p>
