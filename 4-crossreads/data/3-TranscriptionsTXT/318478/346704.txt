[Drawing]Monday 24th Feb. 1919
The above is what we hoped to see on the 24th but the Jackalls seemed to have sent out notices & the nearest was 1/4 mile away & howling derision.  The sparrows almost as numerous as the fleas but not so friendly seem to think the trap was erected with the sole purpose of giving them food & shelter.
The weather improved on this morning and with my light horseman I footed it to a very interesting Turkish trench on a hill called "Johnson's Jollie" and there did quite a good correct study of a Spruce, the light horseman aforementioned, as a stiff.  It was quite exciting in that I had the right kind of man in right clothes and right ground.
