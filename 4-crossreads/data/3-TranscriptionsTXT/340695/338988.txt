there a few nights ago & had a royal time. For supper we had Roast fowl & macaroni washed down with stout & champagne what a feed we had. Joe sings very well & plays the mandolin a little. I think we must have sung right through the Old Globe song book & finished up with "The end of a Perfect Day". Coogan just back from leave is coming with me tonight.Received 19 letters a couple of days ago & 13 to-day they were held up somewhere.We have had some glorious days lately something like good Aussie weather.8-5-17 Sam Smith called to-night we had a great old yarn over old times our "Albums" much appreciated.
