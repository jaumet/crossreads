Dear Mum,
Here is Sunday afternoon again.  I have been sewing & washing Clothes (Hankys only of which there were 30) & washing myself & now I've 40 minutes before Tea-time I am going to walk to the village Church after Tea.  I've not been to the Kirk for months.  Ellis has gone out for a walk with a Sergeant & Dick is playing Tennis.  I have received your letters of 17.3.18, 24/3/18 & 31.3.18.  You have spoken about the banishment of snakes from "auld Ireland"
