<p>1919<br/>Apl 28<br/>started about 9 am &amp; went through Charleroi &amp; Chatelet, passing through an extensive coal mining district.  After leaving the coal district, we passed through very pretty country.  At Floreffe, a small town on either side of the road, a Belgian with a small donkey cart was unfortunate enough to pull his cart into the road just as our lorry was passing.  Our back wheel caught his cart wheel &amp; very nearly took it clean off.  He shook his fist at us as we passed from his ken &amp; for all I know may be standing there yet swearing.  Shortly afterwards we came upon the river Meuse a stream about 60/70 yards broad here<strike>looking at the photo now I think I  have made a mistake, s it looks a lot wider than that</strike>.  There were the usual barges on it, &amp; a towpath alongside.  We pulled into Namur but did not stop there.  Namur is a fair sized town like Charleroi, trams, parks, squares etc. but does not boast of suburbs.  We came outside the walls again (Namur is a walled town) &amp; went along by the river side pulling up at the Casino, turned into a YMCA.</p>
