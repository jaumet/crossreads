train about 10 am : the Aust YMCA supplied us with a snack at Exceter we were supplied with tea bun by the towns people : detrained at Plymouth about 2 pm after a very pretty train ride through beautiful country : left the wharf by tender onto our boat which looked like a zebra with its camouflage stripes : the arrangements seem nice there's a fare amount of room though She is only a medium sized boat : tucker is excellent Australian butter jam pickles meat etc if it keeps like this I wont complain at all :
