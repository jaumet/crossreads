to Le Harve by a short cut about 4 miles entrained righ away but did not leave untill late don't know just when as I was asleep In the same old horse trucks but they have been improved by putting seats along each side & a double row in the centre also a stove. Only a few in our truck 2 on a seat so had a good sleep. Reached Rouen at 7 AM (Sunday) & went to a rest camp close by the Station. Got leave from 10 till 1 & had a look at the main part of the town Some fine buildings & Churches. A large & very ugly group of Statuery at the end of the Main street does not seem to represent any thing in particular Nearly all the Shops were open allthough  it was Sunday A lot of Americans in this rest camp in fact there are all sorts & conditions of troops in it - One young Yank asked me if all our chaps could speak their language as well as I could. He was only a lad & had come from a country district. He sayed it was only 8 weeks since he had first joined up
