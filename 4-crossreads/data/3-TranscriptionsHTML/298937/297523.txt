<p>Sunday 30th January</p>
<p>Dispensing on &amp; off all day.  The first field rations have been served today, &amp; although we had a good dinner, tea was not splendid.<br/>Most miraculous coincidence this morning.  Met Buckle again, driving mule team into camp ground (barrack yard).<br/>He is still with the 6th A.S.C. &amp; is now camped at Maadi.  Then Sellars, whom I did not expect to meet for some time again (since I lost touch with him after leaving 1st at A.G.H.) is also camped at Maadi.<br/>It seems as if I am fated to meet Jack Buckle.</p>
