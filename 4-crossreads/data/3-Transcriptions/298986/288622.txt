<p>easyer to put up with.  Went to British Museum with Aunt S a most uninteresting place.  The chief value of a thing seems to be its age &amp; I cannot say a piece of broken stone with a plate on it saying it was someones Venue is of much interest.  If there are more than one statue of the same man they are quite diferent so they were not much in the way of artists.  I am a bit like J. Cesear.  Most of these old birds</p>
