wonderful canal which was fully 300 yds across;  well, even this could not stop our Advancing Troops. Much praise must be given to the work of the Tanks,  in many a tight corner, they saved the situation. During the day I counted 16 Tanks in operation. Another Relay Post was situated between the Tunnel & our R.A.P. which was very acceptable, as it made our work ever so much easier. An ideal spot for a Relay or Dressing Station, as it was all under the ground, just a maze of rooms & tunnels. No shell made could make the slightest impression on the place. A rush of patients occurred & we were obliged to ask some Yanks to give a hand & they did so without a murmur & worked well. As the hostile shelling was most severe we kept all the cases down in the rooms etc. till the next day.  It was just as well we did, as the next day the appearance of our surroundings told of a severe bombardment.
The following day the 29th inst, was an eye opener to all, Mr Fritz, the sly dog, had gone back another few miles & the atmosphere was very peaceful. Why our cars were able to come right along to the Relay Post & in fact when we arrived about mid-day, at the Post with another case, we found to our surprise that an Advanced Dressing Station had been formed there. This will prove to you, what a wonderful Advance our Allied Troops are making, they cant go wrong.
