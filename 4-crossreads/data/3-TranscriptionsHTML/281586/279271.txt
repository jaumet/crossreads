<p>Girt with modest robes of sacrifice<br/>Let us not mourn this Gory bed <br/>A challenge flings to all who see to raise<br/>A song not born of sorrow, but of praise.</p>
<p>3<br/>Of noble clay, and so we do not mourn<br/>But, in our pride of him<br/>(Who giving all, obeyed the voice,<br/>That, whispering down the dim,<br/>Vast arches of the Centuries, speaks to man<br/>And him lay down his life for another)<br/>Believe that far beyond Times finite span<br/>We shall again behold our brother,<br/>A soul uprisen from the Cumbering sod<br/>Renewed, Eternal, face to face with God.</p>

<p>The Monoplane<br/>1<br/>Swiftly and cheerily<br/>Swimming and swinging<br/>Taut wires merrily<br/>Humming a lay<br/>Way in the upper air<br/>Circling, unconquered there<br/>Bright in the morning glare<br/>Winging her way</p>
<p>2<br/>Surely and steadily<br/>Diving and wheeling<br/>Gracefully, readily<br/>Bearing the strain<br/>Down in a giddy reel<br/>Answering hard on wheel<br/>Then on an even keel<br/>Balanced again</p>
