  
 20 Thursday Rained very heavy all day. forecast very dull.  Very strong sea running  Was very sick nearly all day.  We are expecting to arrive in Colombo tomorrow, mostly the rumors that seem to leak out from somewhere always seems to come true, & I hope it does as we will only be too glad to set foot on ground again. 
 21 Friday Arrived in Colombo about midday.  Went ashore about 2 pm until 8 pm.  Enjoyed myself very much The Singalese people seemed very funny but biggest rooks under the sun.  Knocked about with Gordon Kennedy & Arthur Kilgour  had photo taken in Rickshaw, also took a photo of Colombo Port & of the "Kanowra" but they didn't turn out any good. 
 22 Saturday Coaling & watering operations commenced about 7 am, very slow.  Rather a hot day.  Got leave from 1 pm till 8 pm.  Went through one of the Buddhist Temples, also Cinamon Gardens & Victoria Park.  Had quite an enjoyable evening. 
 23 Sunday Very hot day, still coaling & taking in water I went ashore from 10 till 12 am.  left Colombo at 4.30 pm.
