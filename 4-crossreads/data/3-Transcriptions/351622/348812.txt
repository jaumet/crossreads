<p>Received letters &amp; photoes from Fos Crozier, Joy Sussman mother &amp; Val.</p>
<p>16 April 1916 Sun<br/>I have at last something to write down. About midnight last night just after I had dozed off to sleep I was awakened by the noise of a Zeppelin &amp; a few minutes later crash. He was on his deadly errand of bomb dropping. Luckily our building was not hit. Saw the damage done.</p>
<p>17 April 1916 Mon<br/>The sad news reaches me of poor old Billy Cobbin's death killed by shrapnel behind his gun. Another face Enmore will not see again. One of the best. The Zeppelin did not return last night. Met [indecipherable] from Illawarra Rd to night. All is well &amp; the guns are kicking up a hell of a row.</p>
