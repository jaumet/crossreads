 February 25, 26 immediate return to Australia.  Vin announces he's going in hut while we were breakfasting &ndash; carries to us "Mr. Poole regrets at not being able to say good bye personally".  A five minute's notice to Return to Australia!!! 
 February 26 189. Last night early Frank D. asked if I were going to try for the jobs open to Artists in A.I.F.  Saw Frank S. at O.R. and read particulars &ndash; three men wanted, one for H.Q., D.H.Q. and G.H.Q.  After three months at present rank, now rank of Lieut. and I dreamt last night of wearing larger stripes and apologising and defending my wearing them to myself. 
 But I intend to have a try for it, as does Frank D. and Shepherd.  I'll send the best sketches of sketch book and some more &ndash; one probably of the Hotel de Ville, Bailleul. 
 190. Morning a brilliant sun, now it's cold and grey.  All day long planes have been up, going and returning, last night a terrible bombardment. 
 Rumour of leaving here 29th.  Mail, Davis &amp; Oriole only.  "Father of The Forest" available.  Wrote today for Verhaeren's Belgium's Agony, and one of Aubrey De Vere's book of poetry. 
 191. A dozen times I've placed out those drawings I have &ndash; contrasting them and trying to see them impartially.  Lyttle sat awhile here during the afternoon, and I sketched him, that I'll include, and the profile I did of him two days ago, and I drew one out of a shell hole grave at Flers:  its cross was a rifle with two bayonets forming the arms of a cross &ndash; and a still mirror tied to the muzzle, deeply engraved with the dead name. 
 Tomorrow to Bailleul if the day's fine, and a sketching there of the church, the tower, gable and ugly porch.  Frank shewed me tonight his sketch of the Hotel de Ville, but it's too hardly lined and too ungraceful. 
 Basil at A.D.M.S. office could not procure any particulars but I'm woundering at the 'camaflage' note in the orders notice. 
 Yarning while with E. Green on Paris!
