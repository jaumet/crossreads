<p>Saturday 1 May 1915</p>
<p>This morning the roll was called, and we learnt for certain who our missing comrades were.  A roll call on active service is always a sad sort of affair, and this proved no exception.  The official list is then compiled, and the casualties are reported, the dead, the wounded, and the missing.  The thirteenth, true to its reputation as a <u>lucky</u> number, has suffered less than any other regiment, only a little more than 10&percnt; of the regulation war strength being hit.</p>
