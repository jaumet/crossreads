 To-day things were straightened up.  The Red Cross people by working night and day have done marvels, and we are beginning to see daylight.  Colonel Ryan, a Melbourne surgeon is on board, and under his direction and supervision the operating tables were occupied all day.  There are some fearful wounds to be dealt with including those caused by hits in the head, the organs, and the bones, I am among the very lucky ones merely suffering from flesh wounds.  I had them dressed this morning and am now feeling O.K.  In fact, for a man who is not badly hit, this is simply a rest - nothing to do and all day to do it in.  I am still on my back to give the leg a chance to heal but there is no pain.  Some are suffering fearful agony and we had about six deaths to-day including a patient suffering from pneumonia.  But the medical cases are few and far between, most of the lads having stopped some Turkish lead.  More wounded from shore to-day and the boat is now filling rapidly.  But we shall not sail for a day or two yet.
