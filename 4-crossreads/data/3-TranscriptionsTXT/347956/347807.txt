they are very large thin-skinned oranges; we were paid  1.0.0 to each man this morning & it was very acceptable as we had only drawn 25/- since we left Rosebery & the canteen is not as cheap as it could have been, to say nothing of the silver we paid paid out to the cooks for cups of tea & eggs & bacon  I believe I am still putting on condition & my mo. is progressing favourably;
just heard from the bridge that we are not to move into the wharf till to-morrow.  at 6.30 to-night Orvieto bade us goodbye & good luck & started on her way to England, I am satisfied we are far enough north as last night was quite chilly it was also showeryyesterday this afternoon & last to-night.
Sat 5thLast night was quite wintry here & quite cool enough down here on the troop deck with both blankets
