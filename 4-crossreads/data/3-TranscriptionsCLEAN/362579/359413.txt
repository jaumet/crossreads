number of little houses, that look like Bathing-boxes. They are right up high onto the side of the road. The women sit   & sew there. While the children play on the sand   &  smooth stones look like large pebbles. These huts are arranged ;ole cosy sitting rooms with the front opening on to the sea. It gives the place a very gay appearance. Have been busy to-day fixing some of my things to go on leave. We are fairly quiet. Fondest love   &  kisses   &  hope you are all well.  FromYours lovinglyEdith
