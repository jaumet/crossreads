 Rafa. 
 My mate Major  Irwin  is shot through the arm &ndash; this time I escaped. Without doubt the ANZAC Mtd. Division are a fine lot of men &ndash; we bivouaced last night at Sheik Zowabin for 3 hours to rest &amp; then got back to El Risa with PRISONERS. I &amp; Major O'B &amp; another had  a bottle FIZZ  on our return presented (&amp; kept for the occasion) by our Merchant in Port Said. After tendering Returns to B.H.Q. I shall sleep tonight. 
 My cob did well on Bedouin wheat, but had no drink for 36 hours!!!  Among Turkswe got several German Staff Officers but missed General  VON  -  I took a Belt off a Turk &amp; will get the BUCKLE silver plated  for Dolly . All ranks feel well pleased with their work &amp; themselves altho' we've lost a few good men.
