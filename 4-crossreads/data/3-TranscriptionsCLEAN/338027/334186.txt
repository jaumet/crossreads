  
 Friday, 28 May, 1915 Arrived in Alexandria and got off all our patients the slightly wounded & sick going to [indecipherable] the others to various hospitals, we were pleased to be back in a city again and read the back papers with interest.  After tea when  the last patient had gone we all had a massed parade under Helsham before the Col and demanded an explanation why we a L.H. F.A. should be on a hospital ship when our place was with the brigade.  The Col made a most unsatisfactory explanation saying it was not his wish etc and that he would rather be in the firing line, then our popular little Major spoke up and strongly criticised the Col and as much as said that if the Col would not he would apply to HQ. himself to take us back.  The Col was badly squashed and the men dislike him more every day.  Went ashore at night for a look round and a feed and then met a few of the drivers they are back now and are bivouacing at Victory Beach [?] Saturday, 29 May. The Majestic has also paid her toll in the Dardanelles we learn that the Triumph sunk [indecipherable] position that we occupied. After cleaning up fatigues we were all paid and went ashore and had a great time.  We met all our drivers and had a great reunion dinner.  They are all bivouaced at Ramleh and are having a great time surfing and swimming horses.  Alexandria is full of soldiers wounded [indecipherable] French Zouaves  English Aussies & N.Z. and American tars of the cruisers Caroline & Des Moines the Aust have no time for them and there have been a few fights.  There was a big French festival for the Red Cross to-day opened by the Sultan.  Cabled home telling I was safe. when we arrived back we found our boat had gone and we had to hire a bum boat and row out and find her.  There have been strong reinf. at the Dardanelles in view of the big attack this week.
