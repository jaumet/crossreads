My dear Judge
Just a short note before turning in we probably shift at an early hour tomorrow & are at present engaged in a favourite military passtime known as "Standing by." Shortly it means that everyone is made as uncomfortable as possible & wonders what particular piece of France he will be called upon to "hop over". After "Standing by" for about 36 hours a message generally comes instructing everyone to "resume normal conditions." It's a great life.
The weather lately has been glorious & we are all enjoying the training. The hours are very short - an excellent idea to produce good results - and the men are in splendid condition & spirits. My horse is looking very fine & is in good fettle. I have got a challenge from the C.O. over a scurry of 2 1/2 furlongs tomorrow. I think he will win.
I am on Bn Hd Qrs understudying the Senior L Major & have plenty of work to do.
I received a bundle of letters from you a few days ago including several postcards from N.Z.
Very sorry to hear of Keith being wounded, you are having a pretty hard time. I hear he is getting on alright.
Best, loveaffectionatey yoursC.R.Lucas
