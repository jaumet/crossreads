<p>4<br/>unless we go to England I wont want any now.<br/>Poor old Fred! Do you know I have not had a letter from her for about 3 months (I think it is). I think Alister Stobo is at the Aerodrome Camp Cairo &amp; will write &amp; give him a little good advice. A large Camel Caravan is just passing &ndash; So far it is a quarter of a mile long but I don't know how much more is to come. Au-revoir dear Sister mine. With very much love to you all.<br/>Your loving brother<br/>Fred</p>
