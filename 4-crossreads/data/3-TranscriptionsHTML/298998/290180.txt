<p>junction, attend the operating room only; I think it is fortunate for the patients <strike>that</strike> they are not allowed in the wards. A very nervous person would succumb to their treatment alone. They certainly adhere to the motto "Gott straffe" England. Subsequently my bandages were roughly removed and a dry dressing applied. I was almost enveloped in paper ere I was finished. I was indeed relieved when I reached my bed again.</p>
