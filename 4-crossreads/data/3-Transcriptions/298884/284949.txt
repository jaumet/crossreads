<p>morning at 0500 and went across to the camp where the men were. At 0820 I marched into Warminster with the second party being headed by our own splendid little band. Just before getting on the train tea &amp; food was served out by the Y.M.C.A. and the band played some more. At 1000 all hands got aboard one of the G.W.R. Corp trains &amp; were soon comfortably seated without too much crowding.</p>
<p>It had rained cats &amp; dogs prior to and whilst marching into Warminster but now all the clouds had gone &amp; the silver lining showed bright &amp; <strike>clear</strike> sunny. We stayed a short while at Bristol where we had a good view of the suspension bridge. Arrived at Exeter</p>
