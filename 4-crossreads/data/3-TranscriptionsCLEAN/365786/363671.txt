We saw a dummy gun made from a piece of gas pipe about 5 or 7 inches in diameter & two wheels from a native cart.  This was placed [see image for drawing] on the edge of the Canal & from the Arabian side looked like a real gun.  At Kantara we saw signs of the early fighting, for it was here the Turks made their abortive attempt to cross the Canal.  We saw the trenches & dugouts, the sandbag barricades & the station protected by earthworks & more sandbags.  It was our nearest approach to grim war.
