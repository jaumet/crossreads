<p>by a providential influx of Mutton birds  -  This Petrel goes North to Masthead Island  -  I know &amp; Masthead Island is off Gladstone in Queensland &amp; the Great Barrier reef starts or ends somewhere thereabouts  -</p>
<p>Thursday Oct 19 &ndash; 1914   Since I  last wrote nothing of note has occurred  -  The weather has been perfect  -  What a lonely sea this vast Pacific is!! Not a bird, not a vessel until we touched the Australian coast somewhere in the vicinity of the Seal Rocks &amp; saw the strong light to the North of it  -</p>
<p>I was up at 5.30 &amp; the morning broke perfectly  -  Our trip is ended &amp; all one has to do is to see to it that his mental horizon is wider &ndash; his knowledge of nature &amp; man <strike>improved</strike> added to  -  In my own case I think I can safely say that that end has been very fully attained  -</p>
