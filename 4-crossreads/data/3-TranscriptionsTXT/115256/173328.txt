 Wednesday 10 March 1915 
 To-day another divisional exercise was carried out.  The division was split up into two forces &ndash; the Brown and the White Forces, commanded by Colonel Monash and Colonel Braithwhaite, [Braithwaite] Chief of the Divisional Staff, respectively.  As per usual, no clear or concise scheme of attack was explained to the men, and thus half the benefits of the exercise were lost.  At any rate the 16th Battalion was ordered to attack the enemy, the 13th forming the second line of supports.  But apparently the enemy's mounted infantry carried out a flanking movement, the battalion wheeling round to oppose this force and thus forming a new firing.  Some of our troops suffered heavy loss, the umpire, in many places, ordering the casualty screen to be raised.  Amongst the "prisoners" captured by the "enemy", was our second-in-command.  However, our force was given the decision, and the return to camp was begun, rather earlier than usual.  Being a hot, dusty day, the men suffered a great deal of discomfort.  One thing is certain &ndash; we shall  have to regulate the rate of consumption of our water to the limited capacity our our small (for this country) water bottles.  I mention this because the water carts were rushed.
