 men of my own Battalion. Their quarters were in a deserted house on the bank of the Ancre, just adjacent to the bridge, on the other side of which, stood the village church. 
 May 28th:- Slept last night in the sitting room of the deserted home. One of the guard brought in some fine fish for breakfast. What a luxury! He had thrown a couple of hand grenades into the river, and "the catch" had floated up after the explosion. In this place we used all the plates and teacups found in the kitchen. Rudely disturbed at dinner. Fritz began to drop some 4.2 stuff into the village. Three shells fell within a few yards of the walls of our house. A fourth cut the roof  off  out and fell into the stream a dozen yards away. Fortunately the other shells passed over our heads. Reached La houssoye at 6 P.M finding the village deserted, as it was now within the range of Fritz's high velocity guns* and was regularly bombed at night by hostile aircraft. Slept in the trenches outside Lahoussoye. 
 May 29th:- camped in a wood with other sick men. Attended by artillery medical officer (Major Chisholm Ross). Ears very bad, nerves shattered. Cannot sleep tonight Enemy planes busy bombing the whole of the countryside. 
 * The troops called this gun "rubber guts"; the shell "plonked" in its target before the report of the explosion could be heard, emitting in transit a sharp weird scream
