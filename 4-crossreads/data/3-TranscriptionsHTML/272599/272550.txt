<p>1917 Friday 30 Nov.</p>
<p>I have not been able to keep my diary going the past month. Had a big rush of cases through the recent heavy fighting round Passchendaele. Y.M.C.A. temporarily turned into ward. <br/>Our average of daily deaths in hosp was the largest since it was established. There has been gigantic casualties. If our people at home knew all they would go mad: and the situation at the present time is very grave. The internal trouble &amp; unrest of Great Britain will bring about our downfall if it is not checked  Strikes &amp; revolts are too common  Russia is finished &amp; Italy hard pushed. If we can only hold together till America puts her weight into the scales.</p>
