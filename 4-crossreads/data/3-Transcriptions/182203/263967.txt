<p>Did I ask you for Agnes, Bessie &amp;  Vi's address. I thought I had them. Tell them I have not forgotten them but will write, give them my love. It is very hard to write on board ship, one cannot get a comfortable corner.<br/>I did not go to early Communion but must go to church parade. Hope you are all well  &amp; that I shall soon receive letter from you all. What was the Photo like? Has Moth &amp; Eddy had their's taken. Fondest love    &amp;  kisses<br/>From<br/>Your loving daughter<br/>Edith   <br/></p>
