Then one of his High Velocity shells went into the Ground about 10 yds away from our dugout. We were just settling down again, when the picket sung out \"Gas\". Then there was a wild struggle to find our Gas masks, and we had to wear them for about an hour till we got the \"All clear\". We had to move up again nearer the A.S.C. I rode the Bike, but it was a very dusty ride. We are camped on the side of a Hill, near a big stack of Fritz's shells of various sizes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a big swamp just across the Road, which is simply teeming with water hen. I had a good Bath and did some washing. The water was very cold. At night we had to move back to our old Camp again. Just as we were moving off a terrific thunderstorm broke loose. And it rained like fury. It was quite dark when we reached Camp, so we just had to crawl in under a Tarp, and sleep there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fri Sept 6<br>\r\nSlept fairly comfortable last night, altho? it was on the Ground. Fritz was quiet for once. We found quite a good \"humpy\", and moved the Postal Gear into it. My kit bag arrived from Base. There are plenty of good dugouts about. We are moving again tomorrow. They did give us time to settle down. I really ought to write some Letters, but with this continual moving about one doesn't get the chance. \"Sleep\" and I slept in a dinky little dugout on our own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a5301082\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 82]<br><br />\nMon Sept 2<br><br />\nFritz was over again last night and kept us awake with his Bombs.
