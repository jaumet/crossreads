Camel Corps of dead Horses Camels etc have left my own camera in Egypt but may get some prints. Topped up a few graves.

One station bred boy is worth two immigrants any day, both in Australia & here.  Come here & see!  Poor Mother I'm not running down the English & believe in the Crimson thread of Kinship but not Polo, Bedrooms, Baths etc in the Desert.
