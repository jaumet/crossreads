It is expected that the Turk will shortly give us a heavy bombarding as they are getting ammunition in from Bulgaria; This afternoon a report was sent in saying how many men in this Regt. 2 months &amp; how many have been here 3 months &amp; over, it looks as though they are finding out how many are going on this spell they have been talking of so long, I intend to remain here if I can possibly do it.
