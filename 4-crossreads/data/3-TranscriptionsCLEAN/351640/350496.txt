Can any one make reasonable answer?  Books might be written upon the subject and when one reached the end of reading them no answer would have been found.  'Tis like unto the earthquakes, the volcanic eruptions, the tidal waves, the cyclones, and heaps of other phenomena, for which there are physical explanations, treating of the happening.

"God".  - Yes truly, satisfying as it is and best for you and your colleagues, others must be forgiven in their desire to probe more deeply for reply to the questions, or I should write to test in sofar how far your answer can be analysed.
5 a.m. 5-1-15. Since we came north of the Equator I have been anxious to view the sky in the early morning.  Waking a little after 5 o'clock, I put on my slippers & kimona, mounted the stairs, reached the main deck, looked to the south and there saw the pointers and the Southern Cross, both standing out brightly in a somewhat clouded sky.  The morning star - wabun anung [ahnung] -, was a particularly bright blue planet straight above me, Venus.  The Northern heavens were too clouded for me to get a glimpse at the great bear, but some other morning this can be seen.  It is now about 12-15 pm. on Tuesday with you.  We pass Westward.
