<p>Just remembered this was Leap Year, but nothing doing yet- s'pose there will be after WAR<br/>Court Martial today 2 men got some rotten whisky &amp; threw their Rifle &amp; Clothes into a Canal, practically went Mad-<br/>MUMPS very prevalent in Camp 18 men out of this Squadron alone have gone to Hospital since we left Heliopolis.<br/>  Thank you for Pastoral Times &amp; Australasian- I am afraid there is going to be a bad time ahead for everyone to pay all the Taxation- but it is necessary- better pay up quick, &amp; finish the job then be finished- It's a like a big drought if we got the Backers &amp; the &pound;, S D we can see it through.</p>
