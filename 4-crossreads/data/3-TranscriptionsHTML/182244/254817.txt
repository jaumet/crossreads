<p>Which side will win?</p>
<p>When in charge of a Hospital at Abassia &ndash;&nbsp;700 patients at one time &ndash;&nbsp;&amp; I was in need of information on any subject, all required, in nearly every instance, to get it, was to ask on parade if there was any one present who had special Knowledge about the matter. Almost always some one would come forward after parade to put me on the right track. Languages. Astronomy. Geology. Mathematics, &amp; much else</p>
