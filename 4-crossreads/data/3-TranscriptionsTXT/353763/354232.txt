Wednesday Oct 7We made a bad start on Tuesday night we broke down  -  A tube in the condenser broke - shivered itself & we had to stop & signal the Encounter  -  We got orders to return to Ribaul & transfer to the Aorangi our stores & reserve crew  -  We turned back & proceded slowly for about an hour while the engine room people fixed up the condenser  -  At the end of that time back came the Destroyer Warrego & signaled as to how we were - Captain reported we were all right again & could get to Suva  -  Presently we were directed to turn round & rejoin the fleet  -  We turned round & we 3 - Aorangi Upolu & Warrego steamed ahead  -
Monday was a rotten day  -  Half a gale from the SE & a big rolling sea  -  Our screw was out of water a lot & we had to get along somehow trusting to the great Architect that nothing wd go wrong  -  Nothing did luckily & on Tuesday both wind & sea fell  -  In the aftn  we saw smoke ahead &
