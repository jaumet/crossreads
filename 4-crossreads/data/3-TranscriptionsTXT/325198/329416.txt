20 Dec, 1916BayoudPerce Barrow & 8 of the troop went out on a patrol to Ruesatt 5 or 6 miles out East.  I was with Parky, we had a very quiet & pleasant day.  The boys were nearly all on out Post when we got back & before we had tea it was dark. These days are beautiful; there is much more colour about now.  The skys are blue, & clouds white & fleecy, the sand has lost its glare & looks a soft greyish white; the mornings & evenings come & go attended with rich colour, not like Gallipoli with its glorious blaze at the rising & setting of the sun but quiet rich beautiful colour.  Just the difference between wild mountain scenery & quiet green grassy paddocks with sheep & cattle grazing.
