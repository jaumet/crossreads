  
 The heavy boom of big gun fire from the British front can clearly be heard. We are only about 50 miles from the trenches & believe the Boches occasionally send a taube over in our direction for bomb dropping practice (at the expense of the people beneath). I have seen both aeroplanes & airships cruising round yesterday & today but they are British & French machines keeping their eyes open for hostile aircraft and also any submarines that might come stealing up the channel. The place we are occupying is a hospital of tents formerly run by No.5 British Conval. Depot, we are about a kilometre from Wimereux railway station, 3 kilom. from Boulonge and a few hundred yards from the cliffs from where the English coast can be seen. We are surrounded by British General & Stationary Hospitals (& a Canadian) - about a dozen in all.
