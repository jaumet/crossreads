We spent our hour exercis walk up and down or play rounder etc . This routin was carri on everi day the same . Still get two meal a day never see meat or veget , but we did not lose heart as we thought it would onli be for a short time . There was a canteen where we could buy a few eatabl . We have sinc found out that they were make 2 and 300 on everi articl they sold . The canteen was run by the Command brother in law .
