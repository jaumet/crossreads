<p>an elbow rest.  In another part of our trench we keep a late Turk burried under a blanket, he is so late now that he has almost ceased to make his presence felt.  Another sight which you are likely to run into suddenly as you turn a corner, is the upturned face of a New Zealander who is lying across the parapet on his back with his feet towards the enemy.  Of course the body is absolutely black, as is the case with all of them by this, &amp; the meat is gradually receding from his skull.  Still nobody minds little things like that, the thing that does upset men is the abominable stench which hangs heavily over everything, &amp; the swarms of flies which crawl over &amp; stick to everything &amp; everybody.  With this disgusting stench &amp; practically nothing but bully beef &amp; dry biscuits to subsist on, is it any wonder that such an enormous percentage of men are going down with sickness?  They try as far as possible to keep the men in the fire trenches for only 48 hrs. &amp; then give them 48 hrs. fatigues etc. before going in again.  Our Company got in, however, &amp; stayed there for eleven days &amp; consequently suffered fairly severely.  I was unfortunately enough to fall ill the morning before we entered the trenches;  that night I started my duty &ndash; 4 hrs. on &amp; 4 hrs. off with 1 Company Commander - &amp; continuing this for 11 days did not tend to strengthen me, in fact on several occasions on the last day or two, I had to be helped up after sitting down.  It's a peculiar thing, that although dozens of non-coms &amp; men used to ask how I was &amp; advise a rest</p>
