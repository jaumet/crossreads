<p>Last night all the patients who were able to get about w/out assistance were installed in a large camp of bell tents (about 10 in a tent) which for men in all stages of mutilation is not good business.<br/>For breakfast we were treated to a boiled egg   &amp;  piece of dry bread   &amp;  a   <strike>dixie</strike>  mess tin of tea which we drank   &amp;  had filled about 3 times (a mouthful each) stew for dinner   &amp;  Bread   &amp;  marmalade for tea<br/>Some talk of removing us to night but it looks too rough</p>

<p>We had a variation in diet this morning, Boiled Bacon   &amp;  Bread. Bully Beef for dinner   &amp;  Boiled Egg for tea so we did not do so bad.<br/>One good thing we can get plenty of grapes here as well as chocolate etc.<br/>Went for a  <u>stroll</u>   to Y.M.C.A. tent to get some paper   &amp;  write home<br/>A big batch go away to the Base to-day so may not be here long</p>
<p>The little bay is so full of shipping you could not get another fish into it.</p>
