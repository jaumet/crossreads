<p>nearly 8 months after but the works had got corroded through jumping into the sea at Anzac Cove. However the Ship was soon packed up It was the P&amp;O liner DEVANHA She certainly was not a credit to the crack P&amp;O line. She was the dirtiest of old hellpacket outside or in that I ever saw. That did not matter I suppose. she had been used probably since the beginning of the war transporting troops wounded Etc. and she was in a most filthy condition But we were soldiers going straight into the firing Line right into death and disaster and so the dirtiness of the old DEVANHA did not trouble us much what troubled me was that after having a good time for 5 months in Egypt on good food. I was suddenly recalled to a sense of my surroundings by being suddenly put on bully beef and biscuits &ndash; ugh! Couldn't get a drink of tea that was the worst punishment. We just had to "pig it" anywhere on deck and do the best we could. Later on in the evening we steamed out of harbour and headed for Gallipoli.</p>
