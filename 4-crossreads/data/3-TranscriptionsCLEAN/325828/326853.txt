 My dearest Father, Thank you for your letter to hand on Saturday.  We have been extra busy lately.  Have lost 2 cases since Sunday (pneumonia) & another expected to pass away to-night. As far as I know  now hope to be down Thursday morning about 10 o'clock; don't wait any meals for me Father dear, as everything is so uncertain here just now. Excuse the short note, must leave conversation till I get down- too busy just now. Best love, Your loving son Leo
