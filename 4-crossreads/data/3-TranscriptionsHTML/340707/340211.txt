<p>81<br/>We hit the trail for Montmatre &amp; commence a series of wild drivings with a madman at the wheel who can not drive under 30 miles an hour &amp; so never can turn at proper turnings &amp; is so far past when he can pull up that we have no idea of proper turn.</p>

Clichy.</p>

<p>30-7-19<br/>Cleaning up again &amp; finally declare place clean. Brise cooks dinner &amp; dines with me &amp; then I go to her place for dinner. Where she puts buttons on my new coat &amp; sews up pockets, after a vain attempt to blacken the buttons</p>
