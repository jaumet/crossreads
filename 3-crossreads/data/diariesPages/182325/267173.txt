not in 1st Anzac area. In all cases of Bricks taken from Ypres application must invariably be made to the Town Mayor who will point out the exact places from which they may be carted.
Para 3 Level crossings Transport drivers with vehicle working independently are to exercise the greatest care in going over ungarded level crossings. In cases where clear view of the line cannot be obtained and where there is a second man on the vehicle he should dismount and report all clear before the vehicle is allowed to proceed. No driver should stop his vehicle on a level crossing but should when once started pass over without delay. In the case of vehicles travelling together in a convoy the Senior Officer or N.C.O. present will be responsible for the safe passage of vehicles over crossings.
