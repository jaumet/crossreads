you are all in the best of health.
I suppose you all know by now what has happened on the Western Front at the time I write this letter, but by the time you receive this it will be our turn and Fritz will get the biggest knock back he ever got in his life, for we soon hope to be mixing it with him.I have just had my name taken for Blighty leave again so I will send you a little Souvenir and a photo of myself. I am anxiously waiting for my time and I think I will go up to Ireland this time. I have never met Major Selwyn  King yet although I have tried hard to find him, but that on account of being in different Divisions makes it
