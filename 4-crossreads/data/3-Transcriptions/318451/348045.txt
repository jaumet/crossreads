<p>At 6.30 I took the service at the Y.M.C.A. &amp; gave an address on the same text.  There were about 200 men present.  We had a great time.  6 men signified their willingness to serve Christ.<br/>The night was very foggy but fairly quiet in the front.</p>

<p>Tuesday 19th<br/>Throat very sore.  Had a bad night.  Visited Trenches today.  Had lunch with Major Sneddon.  Went through A &amp; B Coys support trenches.  While I was chatting with Major Rodd the shells were bursting over B Coys support, shrapnel &amp; high explosives.  I was very tired when I got back.</p>
<p>Wednesday<br/>My throat is very sore still &amp; my back is aching badly.  I stayed in this morning.
