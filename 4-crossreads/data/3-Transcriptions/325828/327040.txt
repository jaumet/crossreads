<p>Medical Dept.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 29.6.17  A 11.7.17<br/>130 horseferry Rd.<br/>London S. W.<br/>3rd May 17.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Since I last wrote, I have received two letters from you under date 25th Febry, &amp; 3rd March, for which I thank you very much.<br/>We have been extra busy for some weeks past &amp; although kept going hard at it I like the work &amp; surroundings.<br/>Before I go any further I must tell you that on the 14th ult. I cabled per Agent General for &pound;12.  This duly came through &amp; I received it a week later.  I know you are worrying about my using so much Cash &amp; wondering <u>how</u> I use it; but I will explain as fully as I possibly can, &amp; you will be able to grasp the situation.  Whilst a Driver in France, &amp; even until I was down at Salisbury I was drawing the 2/- per day.  As soon as I was put on the Staff here I was cut down the extra 1/- a day Driver's pay leaving it at 1/-.  The allowance (subsistance) for men stationed in London is 3/6 per day, which brings it to 4/6 p.d.  Meals in London, &amp; food generally is an exhorbitant price, &amp; it is impossible to get a meal anywhere under 1/6.<br/>So you see that this 4/6 goes in food alone.  I think I stated in my previous letter that I have a room at HeadQuarters here in One corner of the Medical Dept.  For this the Military dock me 10/- per week, as likewise they do the M.O. (Capt. Shaw) &pound;1 for his two rooms (sitting &amp; bedroom).  I really can't grumble, as I couldn't get <strike>the</strike> a room in town as cheap &amp; as comfortable.  I have every convenience here</p>
