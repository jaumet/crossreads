  
 At Sea My Dear Aunt, We have had splendid weather since we left Freemantle. We did not get any leave there, only put in there to put two serious cases ashore. There is plenty of amusement on board chiefly boxing, wrestling, quoits, jumping  & concerts at night. Our food has improved & there is a canteen aboard, so we buy plenty of tinned fruit. Pineapple ninepence pears, peaches, etc a shilling. We are having a boxing tournament this week but I will let you about it later on as I have another week yet to finish this letter.
