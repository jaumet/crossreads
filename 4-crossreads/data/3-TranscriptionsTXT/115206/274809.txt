 August,1918 Tuesday 27 
 Bty Position ahead of Proyart. Weather showery. Fritz busy througout the day shelling any and everywhere, three calibres. Walked across to see a 17 inch naval gun captured by 3rd Battalion. A very wonderful large weapon for field work. Evidence shows that it had been blown out by the Bosche, and is now completely destroyed. My birthday I celebrated very quietly. Went out on Bdge line as far as new German cemetery near Poyart. The Hun shelling every little bit of the district and blew up several graves. The district was gassed very heavily, but we did not get much. Raining at night fairly heavy.
