<p>&amp; a view that covers city &amp; forest.</p>
<p>About 7 pm I return to meet Hendy [CMJ] Hotel Continental (expense (1500 to 2000 for 15 days) &amp; have an oporto, accompany him to his room &amp; then find I am too late to get dinner in my old haunts.</p>
<p>I choose an American grill room at the cheapest looking place hereabout. When I enter the lady in charge shakes hands. This seems ominous. I have chicken &amp; rice &amp; bread &amp; cheese, no wine only water Bill 8.50 fr + 80 fr tip &ndash; Ice cream costs 3 fr Salmon Mayonaise 7.50. Such is the price one pays in the city. It is a big expenditure for me if I desire to return to England &amp; purchase some clothes.</p>
<p>6-7-19<br/>Can get to sleep till nearly 4 At 5 am some mad singing enthusiast commence his practices. A funeral goes by then morning most of the mourners are in their ordinary working dress. Some appear to have just quitted their work &amp; without changing joined up This absence of dress is very noticeable especially when going for an evening stroll round about home.</p>
<p>Tonight I dined with Mde Brisson. Soup Vermicelli fish &amp; lobster, beef &ndash; beans &ndash; cheese &amp; cream &ndash; fruit with wine &amp; coffee &amp; yet these are poor people After dinner we talked &amp; I left fairly early for I am not in best of health</p>
