  
 September 1917 up & stopped him, & I believe, not a man of them got back alive.   We advanced a couple of hundred yards, took prisoners & a great number of machine guns.   The wire that the section put out last night & the night before had a lot to do with stopping his counter-attack.   We finished work at 2 AM. & returned home.   Fritz has been bombing heavily all 30th   Returned home 4 AM to Cafe Belge.   The section left Zillebeke Lake yesterday afternoon.   The Tommie Engrs have taken over from us & are moving into this camp to-morrow.   We are very tired after our spell but have had a very easy day.   To-night Fritzs planes came over & dropped a few bombs very near our camp but we had no casualties.   Our casualties in the stunt are as follows 10 killed 2 missing 20 wounded Lt Turner & Sgt Elliott are missing. (28th    I went out this afternoon with 2 sappers to test a well I found near Glencourse Wood & also continue the reconoisance.   We returned home at midnight.)
