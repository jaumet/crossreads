Not so hot - but still very dusty - On Guard - We got news - that we would probably have to stay here till about the 15th inst. We got paid - but instead of getting what was due about 250 pt we only got 50 pt, they also advise that we will only draw (most probably) 1/- per day in future - the Officers tell us that they are cut down by one third also.
Last night the lads wrecked all the Canteen & went mad generally - I laughed to see them cooking their own eggs etc at the Gypo Canteen - they pinched all fancy goods - to day their was a surprise Kit inspection to try & locate some of the goods they got nothing in our lines, they were too slow. 8/6/16  Thursday
Had the day off - Rather a pleasant day. Went for a swim - while marching along we noticed a despatch rider coming along the sand at the water's edge & next we saw that the horse had shied & both horse & rider were in deep water - Major Moseley & Capt
