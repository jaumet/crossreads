In the Trenches again but at a new Post called Y Redoubt - this gives the Horses a rest after their past 3 weeks hard riding. I am thankful as I have a Septic Boil which crucifies my leg when I move & means continuous foments daily. I suppose it's the Tucker.
Flies worse here but am glad to get off riding - while leg bad. The L.H. are a versatile crowd - can take their turn as Pioneers, Railway construction or Trench digging - etc:-
Comfort Fund sent the men tinned vegetables & Tobacco much appreciated.
