<p>out of action; made rather an easy day of it for us all.  On our return we were all notified that we were to be given pack drill at 5 pm, for an hour, for failing to fall in smartly at 2.45 AM, when preparing to leave camp; rather stiff at that time of the morning.  As usual we made light of it, &amp; the humorous side of it overshadowed the rest;  Very fine report from the G.O.C. who inspected us yesterday</p>
<p>Tuesday 23/5/16<br/>Old equipment &amp; leggings called in.  Issued with web equipment</p>
