7/8/18
Villers-Bretonneux
Hun shell set fire to a dump in Villers B and clouds of smoke went up to the tune of crackling SAA and heavier explosions. In all 20 supply tanks were destroyed by this fire. Soon after dark our tanks began to move up and all throughout the night they made a devil of low humming noise. The low flying aeroplanes which were to have screened the noise were conspicuous by their absence. Flares were normal. In the early evening the Hun enthusiastically dropped shells into his own front line ? much to the indignation of his infantry if his liberal display of flares could be taken as a criterion. After midnight infantry commenced filing on to their tapes and our companies withdrew to their ?A" positions clear of the barrage line
