Toora c k. Paddy Ryan came back from the hospital yesterday. Thursday February 28. 1918. 1305. I am two years in the army today, and over 15 months in France. It has been a long miserable 2 years &amp; I will be glad when the war is over and I am back in civie clothes again. I have had a great experience since i left Victoria, and although I dont like soldering I do not regret joining up. I have always done my bit, and have seen a great deal of the world and its inhabitants both good and bad. One thing I am certain of, the army has not an elevating or ennobling influence but rather the reverse. There is great room for improvement in various ways. For instance I heard to day that owing to the great number of leave men who went A.W.L. all leave has been cut down from 14 to 10 days and the leave delayed. This a rotten principle as it punishes the innocent for the lapses of the guilty. Again if a man has lost an article or has something stolen, he is often told to "pinch" somebody's. That is encouraging thieving, yet a thief if caught is severely dealt with. So thieves become cute and are difficult to catch.
