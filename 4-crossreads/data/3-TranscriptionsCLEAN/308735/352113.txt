Wednesday June 19thRained all night, settled the dust, moved off at 9.30 a.m.  moved very slow all day.  Arrived at Montierie (a suburb of Amiens) at 3.30.  Camped in a distillery for the night.  After tea went for a walk towards Amiens and had a look around the shell wrecked houses, everything looked desolate and deserted, seemed as if I was in a city of the dead.  Felt thankful that war had not touched Australia.
