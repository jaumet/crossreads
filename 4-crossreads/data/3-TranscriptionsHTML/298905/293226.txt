<p>Yesterday was pay-day here, I am going to draw as little as possible while here for money is no good to anyone while in the trenches, I would rather save it &amp; have a good time in a decent place.<br/>Last night a Zeppelin flew over our lines but too high to be seen, though we could hear the whirr &amp; hum of her engines quite plainly I suppose she was on a bomb dropping expedition somewhere<br/>I have run out of blue black ink so I have to fall back on this flash stuff.<br/>Bill Hunt got a nasty crack this afternoon from a mortar which fell right alongside him lucky he was not killed<br/>Plenty of excitement this afternoon for shells &amp; bombs fell very thick our guns levelled about 150 yards of old Fritzs tench when they finished it looked more like an onion bed, I'll bet he</p>
