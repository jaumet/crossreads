<p>5 June 1918 Wednesday (X to X crossed out)<br/>X I noticed in your letter all about Home am sure the big "Elm" being cut down will be an improvement &amp; also plenty of wood?  the Lawns must be an improvement too. X My groom Ebbatson has just got word that his brother won the V.C. in France &amp; a commission-   I must share in the reflected glory &amp; probably lose a good groom, but good luck to him!<br/>X Mutual Store parcel arrived safely, many thanks for vegetables &amp; Oleac-  Ill write K later on &amp; thank her I wrote Aunt Louie last mail before I knew re Parcel.
