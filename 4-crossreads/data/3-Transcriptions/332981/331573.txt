<p>station to return by the 8.25 passenger train.</p>
<p>We made ourselves very comfortable in a 2nd class compartment. Just before we started the Conductor checked tickets and as we had a 3rd class return, he charge us 3&frac12; excess for being in a 2nd, anyhow it was worth it.</p>
<p>At 8.27 pm the train started and after a lot of stops and delays we arrived back at 11 pm, 50 minutes late and soon was back in Camp after a pleasant time.</p>
<p>From Dec 26th to New Years Eve, things in camp was very quiet, nothing worth recording happening, there were the usual blowing of whistles at midnight on New Years Eve from the engines, New Years Day passed off very quiet, nothing doing.</p>
<p>From Jan 1st until the 10th I would work one day and off two.</p>
<p>On Saturday the 11th I was ordered to hold myself ready for a transfer to Calais some time on Monday, with a Fireman and seven other Drivers with their mates. I was again informed on Sunday</p>
