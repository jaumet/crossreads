  
 Aug 29 1 pm Sighted land, & 4 steamers, all the boys are excited after their enforced idleness. And we have seen practically nil for 21 days. Sighted table Mtn at 2 pm - about 50 odd miles distant. Arrived Capetown 7.30 & anchored in the Harbor. [in margin] (Capetown) 
 30 Came alongside early this mng. The Miltiades (a sister ship to this) is on our Starboard side & has Vic's & WA's on board. Table Mtn is close by, but don't think I'd like to climb it. Weather good, but misty. No sign of leave yet.  Later  - Came ashore at 11 am & go back
