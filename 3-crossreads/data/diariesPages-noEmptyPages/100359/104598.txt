evidently be doing before long. Stayed home and wrote to E C.
Friday 25th
Building new Latrines. The rest of the crowd are out Harvesting for the Farmers. This afternoon "Jacko" bought a bottle of wine and we cut the cake and drank his health. Quite an interesting little ceremony. At night we adjourned to the "Dive" a nice little room with red curtains and a piano. There are barrels for tables and stools to sit on and the place is quite snug. Jemmy Woods opened the ball by playing a few lively marches, then "Professor" Newton got to work and played the accompaniments to the "artiste" who sang. Son Alldis gave us "Mother Machree" Jacks" rendered "Simon the Cellarer" in an almost professional manner, Brady got through a very good monologue "Singing Soldiers" to the accompaniments of a lighted cigarette and Franks most sympathetic playing on the piano. Bricky Howard rendered "I don't want a girl from Cairo town" in his most touching manner. Then came a gap in the programme, which I endeavoured to fill by warbling the evergreen "Spanish Onion" Tra-la.de-la". By this time it was about to strike 8 by the old Church Clock, so we drank "Jacko's health to musical honours" For his "Jolly good fellow" etc. and finished the night's entertainment with "farewell" in which a number of Tommies joined and helped to make more noise.
Saturday 26th

Wrote to Lill, also posted letters to C E. and Nell. Got another letter from France. Went out to see Peter Hutchison at the Rest Camp which the 15th F. Amb. are running. He has had an ingrowing toe nail removed, but is otherwise alright. There was a "Caf" next door, so
