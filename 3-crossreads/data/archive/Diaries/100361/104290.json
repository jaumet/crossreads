About 11, just as I had finished having a Bath in the Drying Room, the S.M. of No 4 Coy came round and informed us that we were to be prepared to go aboard the Boat for U.K. at 3.30 am. This was the best news we had heard for ages. I shook hands with the W.O. and told him that if ever he was near my place in Sydney he was to come in and I?d give him the best drink of whisky in the House.

Got into Havre at about 4.30. Went to Crystal Palace and had Tea and bought some Tobacco. Then we made our way down to the \"Quai d? Escale\" where our Boat was to sail from. Met a number of WAACS on the way, who bade us an affectionate Farewell. Arrived at the Boat about 6.

As the lights of Havre faded away I could not help feeling a bit \"touchy\" as I've had some jolly good times in France, as well as some rough ones.
