  
 to cap off. We all had to go for a walk before turning in. 
 Wednesday 10th. Put on the Water fatigue which is rather easy so had a fairly easy time writing and doing some photos. A football match was held during the afternoon. N.C.O.'s & officers against the privates. The privates won. 
 Thursday 11th. The great event happened we were reviewed by Lord Kitchener. We were formed up with the second brigade & a few others & he walked slowly down the line, towering above all his companions. In appearance he has altered somewhat being older & not so virile, his face having a bloated appearance. We then formed up into a hollow square & he said a few words to us Australians, I am here to thank you today in the name of the King, the People, the Army, & myself for the good work you have performed. It has been excellent & although has not had the required effect, it has undoubtedly prevented the Turkish Army from helping our enemies elsewhere. The speech was thus very moderated & he described our work as excellent which describes things much better
