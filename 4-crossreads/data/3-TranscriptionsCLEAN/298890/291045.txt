  
 7 Thursday Twilight day with a fog.  Very fatigued felt very tired & cold.  Took double dose of cachets & nearly died in night.  Not able to do anything on play. 
 8 Friday Grey day.  Went to bank & fooled around on various office boy errands:  B. Kinred came at six:  we went to eat at Colonial restaurant thence to Coliseum - Very exhausted & cold. 
 9. Saturday Grey day & foggy.  Got home at 3.20  Had dinner & went to bed till six.  When Mlle. Bloust & Signoria Bambacioni came & stayed to supper to share our already pitifully inadequate food.  Miss Smith tried her plancheth board.  Seems to me it is infliction of thoughts of one who operates it.
