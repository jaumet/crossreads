 he gave us 75 franc to distribut among the crowd . Stan Wright and about 5 other of us went into a hous where we had a great feed of egg and chip , which we great enjoy , as we have n't had a decent feed for some day , ration be veri short , we left H.Q , at about 3 , and march about 2 mile to a big paddock , where the 8th Brig . were load up in Motor lorri . Gen Tivey and most of the head were there watch us load up . We dash off at about 4.30 but I 'm afraid that B.Sec. did ?nt make too good a shew . After a veri pleasant ride we arriv at the littl villag of Strazell , where we are billet at a farm . We are camp in a big barn on nice clean straw and were not long in get to sleep. Sunday 15th Arose about 7.30m and had a sumptuous Breakfast on bread and butter . Then we got order to "fall in " at 9.30 in full march order . Then we went for a rout march . The N.Z 's reliev us at our last post . They have just return from the Somm , where we are on our way to . The countri round about is veri pretti I would veri much like to write to M.S , but it out of the question , wors luck . After dinner Mac I went for a stroll through a coupl of villag near by . It is glorious countri around here , the old thatch cottag with their pretti garden , the wind mill blow round in a leisur manner and the fat cow chew their end and look quit content with their lot . It seem a rotten idea that we are here for the purpos of take part in a war . The tree are look well , and there are ton of blackberri grow along the hedg of which we had a good feed . It was too late for tea when we return so we went into a waysid cottag and a good feed of chip , egg , and coffe . I had a rotten cold and it tighten up on my chest at night .
