<p>Thursday 18 July 1917 [1918]<br/>Sat in garden &amp; enjoyed glorious green trees &amp; bright sunshine.  Slept 10 a.m. 3.30 p.m. then town &amp; fitted coat &amp; skirt Chemla's, very good.  5 p.m. ices at Groppi's and back to 31st per garry.<br/>Have Lt. O'Leary in ward as pt.  He is a V.C. &amp; has done wonderful things, now alas malaria &amp; whisky have him in their grip &amp; one feels sorry for so much fine stuff being wasted.<br/>Lt. Crosby Browne, T'ba, in ward.  Lt. Austin, 4th A.L.H. is another nice boy.<br/>Believe we really did some good in trying for more &amp; better food for these boys of ours so perhaps my trip here has been of use after all.</p>
