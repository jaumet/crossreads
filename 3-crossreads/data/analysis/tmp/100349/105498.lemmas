 The anchorag is veri treacher here so no leav was grant . I slip aboard a tender and stow away was ashor for an hour and a half . A charm littl port this . By a miracl I was not pinch when I return . I should say that the hill around here would be the home of jumbuck . A lot of cargo was tranship into lighter , and then we sail a 8.P.M. 19/4/18 . Steam along within sight of the coast all day . Arrive at Durban at 5.P.M. the harbour is shallow here but the wharv are decent . A white girl was signal to the ship from the breakwat , she is said to meet everi transport . The nigger stevedor are veri activ here , cargo and coal is fli everywher . Durban seem to be a fair size town from here .
