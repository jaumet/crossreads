  
 bombard every night and the echoes are remarkable the din is awful, we have a wonderful view of the sea and as the sun sets below Imbros the scene is beautiful we believe our brigade is coming round here for a rest and we are going to look after the sick.  Since the N.Z. took over old hospital two of the patients have been hit by stray bullets. 
 Friday, 3 September, 1915 Mistake beginning of yesterday [Thursday] Still off duty feeling rather weak most of our stores went around to the new site to-day the remainder will follow to-morrow.  We hear it is a rotten sight for a hospital camp providing very little shelter from shrapnel but we will see what it is like before condemning. 
 Saturday, 4 September, 1915 Still sick living on this soft diet makes one horribly weak, all men were on fatigues.  The camp is looking quite smart now.  The Beach road runs along the bottom and the only man that uses it is a L.H. Dispatch rider and he has to run the gauntlet of bullets every time he passes the sap, a Turkish machine gun waits for him and fires all round him but just crouches low & rides at a gallop.  A warship comes right alongside & bombards the Turkish trenches at Walker's ridge her fire is marvellous, her shells landing right in the trenches.  There is a report that a transport with part of the 6th Bde was torpedoed south of Lemnos but came in on her own steam, there were a few casualties, we are waiting anxiously for further news.
