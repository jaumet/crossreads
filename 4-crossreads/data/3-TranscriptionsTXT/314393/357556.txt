 During the instructions received on this day we were told that all monoplanes belonged to the 3rd Royal Flying Corps being exclusively used for contact work. The B.E.2. type of Biplane is also used for contact work, they being marked with two black strokes under the wings from front to rear &amp; from these also one hung black streamers.

When the Observer received the information he would answer by a blast on the horn then make straight for Battalion or Brigade Headquarters where he would deliver the message by means of a note, with a weight tied to it, to carry it to the
