<p>Almost 80 nurses are there &amp; some are very decent it being a refreshing sight to see a decent woman once more. I had dinner at the sergeants mess at No.2. was treated to drinks at the Canadian, visited the various dispensaries none of which do as much as our own &amp; all have a bigger staff. That of No. 3 has a Lieutenant Dispenser as well as various sergeants</p>
<p>Friday 10th September. Last few days much as before. One evening I accepted an invitation to have a ride inland a bit &amp; was well rewarded by doing so. I first had tea with my friend, a warrant officer of the Royal Engineers then round came the horses &amp; we set off. The country we passed was very interesting. Cotton was growing to quite a large extent as was also linseed, then grapes &amp; melon of all kinds were everywhere &amp; plenty of soldiers were making themselves quite at home amongst them. We passed a deserted Turkish village &amp; came on a herd of oxen specially reared for haulage &amp; a fine lot they were, numbering some hundreds &amp; all fine beasts. Next the old fellow guided me to a small river pointing out various turtles showing their heads till we came to some ruins dating back to the Knights</p>
