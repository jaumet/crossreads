my first night's sleep in a beautiful large Bed with clean white sheets, after my long journey, it was grand after for so long sleeping between Blankets and not too clean at that. I awoke at 8 am after feeling very refreshed and dressed & shaved and had a good hot wash, and then for a time for a half an hour on the Piano which I always enjoy. After leaving the Keys for my Room to be attended to, I went along and caught the Tube to Holborn where I intended having my Meals at the Y.M.C.A Rooms, which is very reasonable. The Ration Meals costing from 8d upwards according to what you desire. The Ladies there give their services voluntary and one is made very welcome and everything is served up well cooked and very clean. I must place on record my hearty appreciation of the kindness and attention shewn to the Troops on Leave, by these Ladies and Gentlemen whom  in some cases have been assisting for over 3 years, not only in this Club but in every one
