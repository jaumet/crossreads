<p>Feeling only fair again &ndash; Met Norm Hill &ndash; attached to the 5th F. Amb, also Geo Chapband &amp; Jin Ferguson who are S. Br in the 12th F. Amb. Jim Ferguson who was not too good was evacuated today. Had letter from Frank, Lill Gort &amp; Kit Lock. Sgt Plummer &amp; Sgt Duffy left the Field Hospital yesterday &amp; went into Amiens, they both got pinched &ndash; so expect them both to lose their stripes. Raining all day. Very quiet day &ndash; hardly any patients in.</p>
