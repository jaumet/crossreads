Wednesday 22 May
Kingcups, daisies and the "Bosom white of the hawthorn bud" are now making this district look simply glorious. Very hot fine all day. Johno came back to-day looking well.
Thursday 23 May
Windy gusty to-day.
An attack seems imminent on this front soon it cannot be delayed much longer. I have an idea the high ground of Cassel-Mont-des-Cats-Mont Noir ridge will be the objective. Troops are coming up this evening. Still morning runs, baths cricket, all day. The Bosch has been shelling about here a little to-day but Hazebrouck has been left alone.
