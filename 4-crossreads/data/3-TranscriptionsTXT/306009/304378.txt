 1915 July 11 Sun. Attended Evening Service at All Saints. Heard the British Military Band which plays  even  on Sunday evenings in the Esbekieh Gardens. Saw a couple of Battalions of Australian Infantry marching through Cairo streets, returning to camp after a route march &ndash; all wearing the shirt &amp; short pants. The Australian troops look far more tough than the other Troops &amp; better fighters &ndash; but they lack the discipline of the others. - Physically they are far superior to the "Tommies". The N.Z. men appear to be good all round.
