Small gardens they are but very gay and beautiful and we sat down on the grass under one of the trees and had our lunch and a good yarn.  Then Wal wrote you a brief note which I hope you received safely for you would be so glad of it.       I took two photos of him, but either the films were bad or the shop people spoiled them in the developing for the prints I have just taken off for you are cracked & bad & I might try & get better ones before I send them home to you.  All the rest of the roll of films are pretty good but just these special two that I was anxious about are crackly looking & very disappointing.          I am enclosing a few prints of some Rid took at Tel-el-Keber & here that he wanted you to see, but I am afraid those two of Wal I shan't have time to do now before the mail closes, and anyhow I fear they are rather a failure.     Well, about our last day together.  We had a peaceful little time there in the Gardens, until about 2.30 when we had to start back to town & Wal to leave me to go on out to the Aerodrome.          I had a note from him next evening from Alexandria saying that he had got away safely as far as that, & then another by the next mail saying that they were going to France, had General Birdwood & other high officials and 3000 troops on the "Transylvania."     I have not heard anything more from him though there has not been time to hear yet, but they must have evaded all submarines by this time & have reached their destination.             I wrote him a long letter the other day & will be constantly doing so now.     From Leo there has been no word yet, though there has not been time yet for a letter to come through.  Have written twice to him since he left & of course
