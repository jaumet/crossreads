<p>6 July 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>A very quiet night for once, a little rifle fire on the right after lunch we went for our usual swim &amp; afterwards went up for a view from Hill 701 Nothing much to be seen only the Turks (2 guns) sent a few shells after one of the trawlers &amp; destroyer, had tea, Turks sent 5 howitzers shells on to our positions from Courtneys to Hells &amp; beyond knocking the parapets about only succeeded in injuring 2 men &amp; then by burying them, we again went to 701 at 6 pm &amp; watched our mountain baty shelling the road (lyditte &amp; shrap) under the Gaba Tepe , an 18 pounder of ours helped the 6" Hows to silence the Turks 5 [indecipherable] (partially) the gunboat on our left was busy shelling our friends at sunset. Two howitzers were rendered fit for service under Capt Pace &amp; were to be put in position tonight. Two aeroplanes were reconnoitering over the Turks for a considerable time this evening.</p>
<p>7 July 1915<br/>Wednesday 47 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Things very quiet during night only an occasional burst of rifle fire &amp; bomb throwing. In the morning we paid a visit to [indecipherable] &amp; had a few shots at the loop holes, the Turks must have changed round for their men are very eager &amp; daring &amp; expose themselves but now they have lost a few they have calmed a little. Went down for our usual swim after lunch &amp; found the water rather leady as a couple of guns in the olive grove were throwing it about a bit. Our howitzers got on to them after a bit &amp; temporally silenced them. About 6 their 6" started to shell [indecipherable] with high explosives &amp; after they had put in about a doz they turned it up &amp; then the wounded started to appear, they got 10 altogether 2 seriously. A 11.2 gun shelled the M Gun Baty this morning but did no damage they appear to come from the direction of Maidos &amp; is of a fat pattern. An effort is to be made tonight to draw the Turks fire at 9.15</p>
