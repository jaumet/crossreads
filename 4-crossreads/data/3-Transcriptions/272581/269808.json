<p>January 1916<br/>place with  high white stone buildings  &amp;  several Australian Hospital of which the Palace is the biggest. On Sunday the 23rd I made arrangements with cobbers to go &amp; see the Pyramids. We set out about 10 am &amp; caught the tram to Ciaro  &amp;  then another tram to the Pyramids. When we reached the tram terminus we paid 2/- each for a ride on a camel as far as the Sphinx. On reaching the Sphinx we had our photos taken on the camels &amp; then hired a guide to show us round. First we were shown all the ancient toombs  of the old Kings  &amp;  every time we stopped the guide would wont to tell our fortunes but did not succeed. He then handed us over to another guide to show us through the Pyramids.<br/>We had to take off out boot's &amp; crawl through a small opening near the bottom &amp; then slide down a narrow passage about thirty yards long. On reaching the bottom of this passage we had to climb up another about the same length &amp; width. At the top of this passage is a big chamber about sixty feet square  &amp; about the same in height, It is supposed to be the burial room of the ancient kings  &amp; there is still a big granite coffin in the chamber. Right underneath this room is another only smaller &amp; this is supposed to be the burial place of the Queens. After having a look at this room we came out &amp; climbed to the top outside X which is 450ft high &amp; was a very strenuous climb.</p>
