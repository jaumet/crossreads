<p>the world forgets. But Devil may care to the last. Some of you tell today with pride aye &amp; brag of it here and there.&nbsp; How you scattered like Pathans side by side with dashing Devil may care. You were plucky enough in days gone by but you haven&#39;t the loving grace to look me <s>squarely</s> <sup>boldly</sup> in the eye, when you meet me face to face. Not that I want it; Heaven knows. Shabby with wear &amp; tear, little remains now, I suppose of what once was Devil-may-care</p>
