Dated 2 Sept. 1915. 194 words]<br/>[Report by Ashmead Bartlet on the second combined British/Anzac operations at Suvla Bay and Lone Pine, 21st August]<br/>Daily Telegraph  London  <strike>R.T.P.</strike><br/>Cable six section one stop    August twenty third stop   if we have failed in the great strategic scheme of getting astride the peninsular north of Anzac by seizing the hills round Anafarta and forcing the enemy to abandon his positions before Achi Baba and on the Kilid Bahr salient  it has certainly not been through want of trying stop  the original plan just failed as the most carefully laid plans will go wrong in war because the 9th Corps failed to carry out the task assigned to it namely to push through with a rush when the enemy was completely surprised and had only a few battalions picked troops it is true of Gendarmes to oppose the tenth eleventh and fifty third divisions stop  every possible step had been taken by the General Staff to insure the success of this dash and only one factor was lacking which caused the fatal delays on August eighth and ninth namely a veteran division of picked and tried troops such as the famous twenty ninth proved itself to be on that historic morning of April twenty fifth at Seddul Bahr stop</p>
