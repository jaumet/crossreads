  
 Tuesday 31 July 
 St. Omer this morning.  I followed a Ford Ambulance out  on  to Racquinghem.  This Amb. was carrying our Colonel.  I was given orders and directions as to where the different parties were to be billetted and then had to see that these instructions were carried out. Returned to St. Omer and arranged for Daily Papers. Now living in a barn
