<p>Friday 14 June<br/>Put into our own little hospital to-day with a temp. of 103 deg; and feeling much off colour.</p>
<p>Saturday 15 June<br/>Much better to-day &amp; temp. is again normal, but very stiff and sore.<br/>A big attack by the Bosche is expected to-night &amp;  troops are being moved up to meet it.  Our bearers are going up again as well some from the 2nd Field.  In fact I think our people have rather reliable information as to the German's movements on this front.  Even on &frac12; mile of front where we were, three divisions were identified in eight days.</p>
