12 Oct, 1916Hill 70The troop is in a very disorganised state owing to the number of boys away on leave  "Tom the Terrible" & Perce Barrow & several others are away for a week at Sidi Birsh [Bishr] "Lucky beggars" & some one goes every second day to Port Said for 48 hrs.  The chaps who are left  have counted their quids? over & over & searched every pocket hoping to believe there will be enough to go away on when the Sidi boys come back.  Some are doing the old "Sidi" or the Desert stunt at the schools & "Finish Sidi Birsh" is a very favourite expression down there just now. Drill is "off" thank goodness.  I only had one morning at it.
