<p>I would give anything for a good Australian Summer's day. I think I could relish any amount of heat now.<br/>I am forwarding with this letter a small packet containing a small bracelet for pet, and two small brooches for mother. One is our battalion badge with the motto "Strike hard" underneath. I intended sending it with my last letter but could not get it away at the time.</p>
<p>We frequently witness exciting aerial duels between artillery and aeroplanes. The shrapnel can be plainly seen bursting about the 'plane but although I have frequently seen 'planes surrounded by countless some of which appeared to be certain hits I have not seen a 'plane brought down. The shelling has the effect of frightening them off anyhow and keeps them from venturing too close.</p>
