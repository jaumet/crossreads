Found Mrs. Lund of 115 London Rd. Neath & handed to them my letter of introduction from my friend Norman Farquhar.  In conversation I ascertained that they came from Ossett the town next door to Dewsbury where dad was born.Arranged to have dinner with them.To Hospital for an hour.Dinner at 1 and chatted with family, Mr. & Mrs. & Miss Dora Lund.Back to Hospital again with biscuits & matches.One of the boys in the Hosp. died last night at Hosp. with shrapnel in lung.Left Hospital at 4.45.  Thence on to Swansea & had tea near Station.Leaving belongings at Y.M.C.A. took a run out to Skeret, [possibly Sketty] a suburb.Things noticeable were selling fruit by pound, the calling of peanuts monkey nuts and the true Welsh people who contrary to my imagination were a dark skinned people liken much like French people.  Their language was impossible.  After fruit supper I turned in.
Sunday 10thUp early and after a clean up had to leave before breakfast.The town was hardly awake when I passed thro' and Welsh towns have that name on Sundays.Travelled by 8.45 train to Neath.Left belongings at Mrs. Lund's & thence to Hospital with the New Zealander Barrington.  Took some fruit.
