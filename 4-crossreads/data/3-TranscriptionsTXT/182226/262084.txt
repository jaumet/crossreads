The sand is everywhere as the wind has sprung up, we were out digging in the morning & were almost smothered. In the afternoon it became so bad that we couldn't be taken out.
The sand flies about just like rain, cutting our face & hands not to mention filling our eyes & ears.
Gambling is going on hot & strong 50 piastre notes ( - 10/-) floating about all over the place. All is fine form. I am going easy myself as I have leave to go to Cairo tomorrow & do not intend to lose that over a game of cards.
