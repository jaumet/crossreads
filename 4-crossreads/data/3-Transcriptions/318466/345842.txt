<p>Wednesday 13 November 1918<br/>Rup went to Town for lunch with Mrs. Curtis.  Ede came over to tea.  Took her out to dinner later as the house was not exactly lively.</p>
<p>Thursday 14 November 1918<br/>Up to Aussie House for labels &amp; final instrons.  Back in afrn. &amp; packed luggage &amp; took same to Euston with Muriel.  That new watch of mine is a washout.</p>

<p>Saturday 16 November 1918<br/>Embarked at 12 noon on the "Balmoral Castle".  Beastly cabin so got it changed.  Not a bad ship.  Food quite good.  The MacIntoshes are aboard.  Beaucoup A's also.<br/>Embarked on the Balmoral Castle for New York.  The food on her is a great change to England's war rations.</p>
