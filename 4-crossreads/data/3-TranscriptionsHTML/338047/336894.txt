The top rooms were the same. I picked up a lousy looking blanket and Nesbitt and I dossed in a corner of the stairs. Two or three men came up and fell over us, but we were too tired to mind much.<br/>Nov 8<br/>We were up early next morning and had a rough wash in the back yard. Regarding the food, it was a case of "last in lousy". I got hold of the remains of some tinned stuff and a piece of bread. Some of the late risers got nothing. We donned our equipment and went over to the station again and reported to the RTO. I told him the pitiful story of being overcarried, and he gave me a pass for Nesbitt and myself to take us back to Abbeville also the information that a civilian train left at 10 am. We went around the town and saw the cathedral. It was remarkable</p>
