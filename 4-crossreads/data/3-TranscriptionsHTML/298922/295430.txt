<p>Saturday 14 April 1917</p>
<p>Turksshelled our rail head with big guns this morning &ndash; but we are camped a little back. We can bathe but are warned that sharks &amp; mines are on the beach!!  Comforting.</p>
<p>Parcel of Plum Duff Lanoline Shaving Soap Sweets all arrived safely. Never send CHEESE. We get it issued like Oil in the heat &ndash; and Tinned Milk is not worth sending. All the above many thanks. I am being very well treated.</p>
<p>[The following crossed through.]  Am glad JOE had some good fishing at King on Hopkins, some day I hope we may go there together.</p>
