Somewhere In France   27th 5 1916Dear J.Your letter dated 13.3.16 arrived yesterday also one from Mother & Bett. my letters are just beginning to arrive, here, a few days ago I received 7 and yesterday 5.   I think all Mothers letters have arrived now.  I mean those that were posted addressed to Egypt.   Thanks much for the present.   I will be able to change the notes here, and I fancy they are worth a little more than Aus. paper would be over here.   But just where to spend them, and what to buy is another matter if we were near one of the larger towns, way back from the firing line it would be easy enough but here the only articles worth purchasing are Luxuries that our Comisariat Dep. does not supply.   Such as Eggs, they are only 2 1/2 d each.    Preserved fruits 2/- per tin, in Aus. about 1/1 other articles are much the same.  Bar, Wines & Beer.   "So far as the brands of Wine stocked here in these Esta [blank] are concerned I dont  like them they dont come near the Australian article  Champagne, at 5 Francs, per Bottle is not too bad  But the 15 franc article is better.   But I can assure you that I dont go in for any.   "A Frenchy told me that it was no Bon for Privates, only for Officers meaning that a privates pay would not stand the strain, I quite believe him.   The French Beer you can purchase for 1d per glass, if you are very thirsty and there is no water about the stuff is just drinkable or some of it is.  I have seen a good solid beer drinker turn round after taking one mouthful and leave his Beer on the Table.   at one place they stock an article which they claim is English beer.   it is certainly a better article than the other, but I fancy only English in name, but it is 3d per glass, only small glasses at that, so what is a man to do when I want a drink - go for the 3d article.
