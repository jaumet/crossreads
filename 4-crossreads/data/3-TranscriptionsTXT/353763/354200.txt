Australian detention depots while plantation & store are left to guide their own destiny  -  We went off to the old Upolu & put in a quiet eveng  -  At 10 pm a rifle shot rang out & soon another  -  A boat had evidently not answered our challenge  -  The night was murky dark & you mustn't go fooling round a fleet in the dark in war time I can tell you  -A native policeman here was challenged by a sentry on his approach & cleared out at the double instead of standing still  -  A bullet ended his career promptly for the sentry - quite rightly - shot him dead =Talking of prisoners here is a funny thing  -  At night a lot of Germans are locked up & guarded by acting native police & in the morning they are let out  -  The Germans then run these natives don't suppose (They're not the regular police niggers) all the day & again at night are collected - marched to barracks & locked up for the night by their servants  -  Masters by day - Serfs at night & vice versa  -
