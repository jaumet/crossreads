<p>My Dear May,<br/>Just a few lines to let you know I am still going strong over this way. I'm sending you this P.C. as a souvenir but of course we completed our 1000 days some months ago, abut that makes no difference, this is the card.<br/>Well May I'll have to ring off hoping all are well as this scrawl leaves me at present<br/> I remain<br/>Your loving Uncle<br/>Clarence</p>
