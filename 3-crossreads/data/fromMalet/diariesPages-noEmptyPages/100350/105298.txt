29 Had a good spell all night and was properly in need of it. Everything pretty quiet along our front this morning. Sgt Parsons beginning to break down in health, but insists in remaining with the boys. One of our aeroplanes flew over enemy lines dropped bombs this afternoon and had no sooner retired when a German Aeroplane came over our lines and dropped 2 bombs one fell into the sea and the other killed 3 mules. Warm weather and water still very scarce.
30 Stand to arms at 4 this morning. Went for a dip after breakfast Turks put in a few shells on the beach wounding 4 men. Our Monitor French Battleship bombard "Achi-Baba" this afternoon. German Aeroplane came over our lines again this evening and dropped bombs steel darts about 3 inches long but did no damage.
31 Very quiet all night. Parsons myself took a tour round "Walkers Ridge" after breakfast had a good pair of glass,s could see Turks gunners working their 10 Pounder gun against our trenches at "Quinns Post", Hard to distinguish enemy trenches from our own now, as they are so jumbled up. Especially at "Popes Hill" where it is a mass of trenches. We witnessed a grand but deadly sight this evening on our right away down South were the Turks attacked our lines. The air was alive with bursting shells of all calibre,s, the rattle of musketry was deafening. Got quiet again after dark.
