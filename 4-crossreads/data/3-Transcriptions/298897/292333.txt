<p>Tuesday 25th<br/>Orderly Sergeant again &amp; same duties as yesterday.  The worst part of the job is getting up to wake the men.  More mail arrived which gave me 5 more letters so that I am well satisfied.  My rank of Sergeant was confirmed from the 22nd inst. The other two in the same section being left over till next day.  Why, I do not know unless 'twas to make me senior to them.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th<br/>Orderly Sergt. Again &amp; was kept running about a good deal.  Had a couple of patients in who had been in "no mans land' a full week wounded.  One was much exhausted the other looking quite well &amp; strong.  Two more arrived later &amp; gave a tale about subsisting on 3 biscuits the whole time but their appearance belied their statement.  They probably were in some deep shell hole or such like place &amp; were afraid to move until forced to.  There would be plenty of rations about of the dead, sufficient to keep them strong.</p>
