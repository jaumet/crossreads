<p>Paris&nbsp;on the 6th August</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I write to you this letter from Paris. &nbsp;I have come back here for you have perhaps seen in newspapers the class 1920 was about to be called.</p>
<p>I shall go as a soldier probably in October or in September. I pass the revision at the end of this month.</p>
<p>There is a long time ago that I received news of you and I am thorougly surprised</p>
