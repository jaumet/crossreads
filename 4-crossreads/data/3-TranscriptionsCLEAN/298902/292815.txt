  
 Monday 23rd Dec.  Men who sailed from Australia up to June 1915 have been called for & will leave here on the 26th so I am being left badly.  Word has also come through that the Ambulances are to be cut down from 3 to 2 sections so I'll be busy returning to ordnance, 1 Sections equipment.  Today the Colonel gave me a   Tuesday 24th  free hand in regard to running the Christmas dinner for the unit, said I could buy what I wished and make what arrangements I thought best.  'Tis very difficult to get anything extra as food is so short and altho. an effort has been made to supply turkeys, the number is so small as to be of little value.  However I set to today & managed to locate a few fowls, potatoes, cabbages, celery etc & with extras which I can supply from Comforts I hope top put up a very good dinner.  My idea is to have a good dinner with the Sgts to wait on the men, then we would have our dinner at
