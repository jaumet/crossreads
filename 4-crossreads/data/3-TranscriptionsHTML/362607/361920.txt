<p>Dear Dad, Mother &amp; George,</p>
<p>This is the sort of Country we live in. I have not been out to see it yet as we are not allowed to leave before 5 &amp; it is then too far to walk. Dave &amp; I set out last night but after 30 minutes walk nothing was sighted so we returned back &amp; went to the Pictures. I may try for an afternoon off soon &amp; go to Salisbury. I believe the Cathedral is fine. We are doing well &amp; having plenty of rain so that the cabbages will grow. The leaves are beginning to fall now so very soon the winter will be on us. We do not notice the cold yet. Everything seems to be just going on the same. We don't think that we ought to be having Hot Weather. Harry</p>
