<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Saturday 18</p>
<p><strike>Thursday 16</strike></p>
<p>Spent a rough night on deck in the rain but overcame the difficulty by wrapping myself in a waterproof.</p>
<p>The nights are getting much colder now, &amp; the days cooler.</p>
<p>Usual parades &amp; drill with the addition of allotments of places &amp; duties by lifeboat &amp; a lot climbing around discovering falls &amp; man ropes.</p>
<p>If a torpedo hit us I am willing to wager that only half the boats would get away, for the difficulties of a list would require far more organisation than we have.</p>
