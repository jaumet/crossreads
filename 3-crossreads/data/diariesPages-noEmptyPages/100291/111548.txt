April Sunday 1 1917
"Camp" in a ferment this morning Bugle blew reveille at 5.30 a.m. parade quarter-hour later. Orders out to strike camp remove it to Aveluy other side of Albert 6 miles distant. 
Such a removal means a prodigeous amount of work. All patients (scabies) had to be shifted, tents marquees pulled down much heavy loading. Work hard till tea time. Turn in early.
