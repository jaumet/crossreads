 Arrived at Alexandria at 4.30, berthed alongside the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers later the Connaught Rangers came into port. 
 The natives get dirtier & lower in cast all the way along, the best class of Natives are seen at Suez, at Port Said, they are much the same only dirtier & at Alexandria they are just scum. 
 We only managed to get onto the wharf & saw nothing of the town. 
 We left for Cairo at 8.30 & arrived at 3 a.m. 
 When we got into camp we slept on the ground just in our ranks. 
 We are camped at Heliopolis 8 miles from Cairo, you can see the Cheops Pyramids from here.
