 is quit close to our camp . I sent my pay book away this morn to England to have it audit so as I can see how I stand . I have just been think of the last artilleri duel I saw that was the other day , the German began it on a love morn lob the first shell on to our trench did not stop till they had got rid of 4 or 5000 , I do n't suppos 1 % of them done ani damag to either life or limb , in spite of the skill of the German gunner the accuraci of their gun , but the gun on both side put you in mind of a choir , where one sing the other answer 's away they go for all they are worth .
