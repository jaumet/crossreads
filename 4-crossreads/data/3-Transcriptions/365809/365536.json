<p>(2)<br/>I am getting rid of all superfluous kit, anyway and intend travelling very light from now on. Just at present I am the most unpopular officer I should say in the squadron. I have been inoculating for typhoid and, like the cook when the ration and issue is bad, get black looks from all and sundry &ndash; more marked because my own dose  (a bono fide one too) did not affect me except to a slight extent locally.<br/>A good many of the men have had a bad trip with it &ndash; probably because they' re a little run down after their recent turn on the line whence we have just come for a spell.</p>
<p>I am afraid there is a big chance of our having some malaria trouble &ndash; the mosquito is here though in small numbers at present and the Salonica troops have the parasite. Prophylactic measures &ndash; directed towards the prevention of mosquito breeding have been adopted for some time with excellent results but unfortunately you cant get them all &ndash; the country farther N where we hope to go has always been malariel.  I don't fancy it &ndash; will ever be very bad though &ndash; like it was in Salonica.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson and yourself<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>Ronald J. Hunter</p>
