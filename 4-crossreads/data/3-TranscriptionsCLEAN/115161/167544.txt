course they were terribly surprised) with the result that the whole hut was squirted with a most evil smelling liquid, which succeeded in getting into our lockers and staining our clothes.
When we turned in that night only a few of the vermin attacked us, but the awful smell of the stuff prevented us from sleeping.
These vermin I understand breed very quickly, I should imagine they do as in a few nights they were as bad as ever , but we never complained again, we got used to them, but the awful smell I'm sure we could never have stood again.
The next day I was put on "fatigue" duty. This was a job which required the utmost vigilance on my part. I had to clean-up round an officer's tent. Only just round one small bell-tent. During the whole of the day - from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. I succeeded in picking up no less than six cigarette buts, an empty match box, and a couple of pieces of paper (one was an unreceipted bill I fancy). I had to carry the rubbish in a sand-bag and tip it into a box some hundred yards away. Most of my time was taken up by springing to attention and saluting the many officer friends of the one which occupied the tent (I've no doubt they all called with the one object, viz:- whiskey). I didn't get one myself, but I often got a whiff of it as they passed out.
Of course this job got me thinking again, wondering what picking up cigarette-buts etc. had to do with slaying the enemy. I'd had no drill at all so far.
One afternoon my wife and daughters called at the camp, so I naturally wished to show them over. Will you believe me I went to no less than nine officers for permission, and not one of them seemed to know if it was allowable. The last one I saw however, said that he didn't think it was permissable, but that if he were me he would take the risk and show them around. I did not. I didn't want to be crimed.
