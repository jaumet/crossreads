<p>August 1915<br/>Sunday 22<br/>Fine . An English howitzer battery behind our lines is pumping high explosives into the Turks trenches and also shrapnel on to where they think the enemies' guns are. The enemy replies with shrapnel from his quick firers, doing no damage.</p>
<p>Monday 23<br/>Windy Threatening rain. Turks threw bombs a treat last night to no effect though. Our chaps have them thinking seriously when they throw a gun &ndash; cotton bomb on to the Turk's trench. We left the trench again at 2 PM to go out for 48 hours rest.</p>
