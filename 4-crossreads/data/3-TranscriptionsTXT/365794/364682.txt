Saturday 6 October 1917Rain & gusty day.Our boat begins to roll once more but no swell.  Still we sail N.W., sun now sets well to port side & up towards nose of boat.Drawing animal competition held 8 p.m.  Animals wonderful & awful.  As usual most of competitors told each other before guessing time thus rendering "we's" out of the running.Today we crossed the equator, moderately cool with showers & strong head wind blowing.Having a sense of humor helps one immensely as for instance - one sister tells me she is cousin to Lady Warwick or thereabouts & is holder of letter from F. Nightingale.  2 others (just trained) lay down the law about private nursing, tact, etc., & are "bored stiff" by diagnosing their friends diseases.  One listens & wonders.
