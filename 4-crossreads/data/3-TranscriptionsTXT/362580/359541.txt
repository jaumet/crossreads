 The weather is getting much warmer but to-day has been delightful. 
 We have not heard anything of a move for us yet, some fighting has taken place not very far from here but we have not got any of the wounded. 
 Oh, I just hate to think of the poor wounded fellows.  How I wish this war would end.  I'm very much afraid this letter is not very interesting 
 Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. 
 From your loving sister Edith.
