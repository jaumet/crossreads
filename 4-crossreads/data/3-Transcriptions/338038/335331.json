<p>Getting through this stunt, we are expecting to go out of the line again for a few weeks which will be very pleasant at this time of the year, weather warming up nicely &amp; no rain for the last fortnight.</p>
<p>Will drop a line again later when opportunity presents itself. Meantime with all hopes for your's and the dear Mother's health &amp; with love</p>
<p>I am your [affestace?] Son<br/>Terence</p>
