  
 wanted badly as had had no dinner, cost 87. wine and coffee extra. Completed the night by going to the Olympic Music Hall some very good turns. Bed 11.30. 6th Nov. Wednesday  Up at 8A.M. had a glorious hot bath & then went out without breakfast. Visited the Hotel D'Lena where our Pay Office was but found that I could not draw pay without getting my pass stamped at the barracks. Had breakfast and a haircut here then went to the Barracks for the necessary stamp arriving back at 12 o'clock when I drew 14 making my wad about  26. It was raining hard so decided to leave Paris & go to Nice that night . Had lunch in the Boulevard Haussmans 6 Francs, then went by bus to the Gare du Lyon where after some trouble I booked a seat in the Rapide, the express all 1st.Class, tips being necessary. Returned to the city, visited a couple of places, one being d'Eglise St. Sulpice. Returned to Hotel paid for my room 14F.& 1-50 as luxury tax.
