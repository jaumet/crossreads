<p>in the Galapagos group, where we completed with 1250 tons of coal, the remainder of the fleet patrolling outside whilst we took in the coal. This was carried out in turn by each ship. These islands have rather a barren appearance. There are a few cattle, and on Chatham Island there is a small settlement. The water here abounds in turtles, sea - lions, &amp; sharks. Frigate birds &amp; pelicans are very common. The evenings here are the best part of the day, for the sunsets are extremely beautiful. and the sea is literally alive with various forms of life. Sea lions gave short husky barks and turtles flopped about everywhere. Very little fresh food was to be had here. We were still without potatoes, &amp; we were substituting rice. Butter had become rancid, &amp; even matches had become scarce. We kept lamps lit in order to economise the latter. Various sorts of fish, names mostly unknown, were caught here, but these&nbsp;had to be cooked immediately for they became bad in an hour. However one was glad of even a little fresh food, which was a welcome addition to the tinned fare on&nbsp;which we lived. The opportunity was taken here to buy 4 bullocks, &amp; our butcher accompanied the Paymaster to cut up the beasts on completion of the deal. According to our Paymaster the natives&#39; method of killing a beast was extremely crude, it being, as far as I could gather, a series of furious onslaughts with chopper in hand, made by one of the settlers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
