<p>After dinner I go to Merry Grill a cafe full of life &amp; jollity. Here dancing, singing, love making, drinking &amp; gaiety unrestrained gladden the heart of this weary soldier Everyone is so natural that gaiety infects even my sluggish English blood There is no forced laughter or idiotic &amp; clumsy attempts to appear gay. They are naturally gay &amp; enjoying themselves because they are expressing their feelings &amp; not because pleasure is a duty.</p>
<p>I am quite at home in this atmosphere &amp; enjoy myself immensely. One pretty little Dutch girl Lessy Bongen Rue de Brabant 216 contributing much to my pleasure because I am Australian.</p>
<p>During the night I wander round in Madrid Cafe in Rue Pont Neuf &amp; Queen Victoria in 40 Galerie de Commerce (Rue Heuve) La Gaiete &amp; Bruxelles Remesse but return to Merry Grill which I leave at 2.45 am though the crowd is still there. Among the crowd are two French aviators &amp; excellent fellows they are. The night has been one of the pleasantest I have passed &amp; though I had no money I <strike>saw</strike> had a lot of fun.</p>
