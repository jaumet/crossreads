 I will try and send you a telegram from our first port of call but don't be supprised if you don't receive it as I dont think that we are going to be allowed to land and I will have to try to get somebody to take it for me. Sunday morning was a bit of a change for us from Easter morning I guess;  however it was not so bad here as by working hard at stables all the morning they let us have part of the afternoon off and I took 2 letters out of my mail bag to celebrate the occasion.  I have written an awful lot of letters by this mail and I am affraid there is not much in them but it will start people writting to me.  I wonder how Bill Graham is getting on; Beverage has gone and he developed mumps on board now.
