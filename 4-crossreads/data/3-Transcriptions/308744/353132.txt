<p>further dimunition in the amount of co-operation they might expect from their air service. It read "As long as the English use two seaters which are superior to our machines in climbing capacity, successful activity on our part is very much in question owing to the impossibility of the single seater even to attempt to make an attack on higher flying and better climbing two-seaters, and owing to the impossibility during the attack of the enemy, to take over the attack ourselves."</p>
<p>It may be noted here that, at this time, the enemy was equipped with 'Rumplers' (two-seaters) fitted with Mercedes engines of 260 Horse Power. ; L.V.G.'s  (two seaters) fitted with Benz engines of 260 H.P.  Halberstaters (two seaters) Albatross D.Va. Scouts, with 160 H.P. Mercedes engine. These two-seaters were about equal in speed to our Mk. 111 Bristol Fighters, but were invariably out-manoeuvered.  Our pilots had good opportunity of judging the comparative speeds of these machines in the numerous 'running' fights they were engaged in, for in the majority of cases, if the enemy succeeded in getting a clear run, the combat developed into a stern chase. On a number of occasions enemy aircraft were hunted right back to their aerodromes where they landed under fire from  our pursuing machines.</p>
<p>MARCH OPERATIONS:  Throughout the month of March the territory East of the JORDON engaged the major part of our attention. In preparation for further operations in this sector, the whole of the country East of the river and South of DAMIE to KUTRANI was reconnoitred continuously all roads and tracks were fully reported on and photographed. The AMMAN-ES SALT-ZERKA  area was visited on 26 occasions, 4 reconnaissances of the DAMIE-ZERKA area was visited on 25 occasions, 4 reconnaissances of the DAMIE-ZERKA-ES SALT area was made; while the MADERS-KUTRANI-KASTAL sector was visited 8 times. Those reconnaissances involved non-stop flights of from 160 to 220 miles over very mountainous country. The Western area NABLUS-TULKERAM, KALKILEH &ndash; was &ndash; reconnoitred on 10 occasions, but no developments of importance were reported here, practically all activity being confined to the Eastern Sector.</p>
<p>During the month 23 photographic reconnaissances were carried out, in the course of which 194 square miles of country was covered. These photographs were chiefly of roads, caravan routes and tracks between ES SALT and AMMAN, and an overlapping series of the KAKON defence system.</p>
<p>A good deal of bombing was done, 17 raids being carried out, and 7,598 l.bs. of bombs dropped. Early in the month hangars and machines were reported at  KUTRANI for the first time. The aerodrome which was situated close to the Railway Station, was bombed on the 4th  with good effect by pilots, Lieuts. A.V. Tonkin and R. Burton escorted by Capt. R.M. Smith M.C. (Pilot) Lieut. E.A. Mustard (Observer) and Lieut. T. Taylor (Pilot) and Lieut. W.P. Cashman M.C. (Observer) Aspect photographs of the aerodrome and station were obtained.</p>
<p>While on a reconnaissance near JILJILIE on the following day Lieuts. E.S. Headlam and C.N. Watt (Pilots) and Capt. T.C. Macaulay, R.A.F. and Lieut.  E.B.S. Heaton (Observers) in 2 Bristol Fighters, were attacked by 5 Albatross Scouts. The combat was indecisive.</p>
<p>Pending an attack upon the HEDJAZ RAILWAY at AMMAN, the bridge of DAMIE, the crossing over which enemy reinforcements to this area could be expected to pass, was bombed on the 14th again on the 20th., twice on the day of our attack on AMMAN, the 21st and finally on the 26th  and 27th when operations were in progress. This was the first occasion upon which 230 lb. bombs were used on this front, the largest bomb available previously being 112 lbs. One 230 lb. was fitted to a Martinsyde machine, flown by Lieut. F.W. Haig. He visited this target on 3 occasions to reach which the machines had first to fly over the Judean Mountains and then descen[d] into the JORDON VALLEY, the target being 1,000 feet below sea level: Other officers who took part in these raids were:- Pilots:- Capt. S.W. Addison, R.A. Austin, M.C., R.M. Smith, M.C., Lieuts. H.S.R. Maughan, A.J. Morgan, R.S. Adair, J.H. Butler, C.S. Paul</p>
