<p>number of guns also a lot of our old Somme positions recaptured such as Grevillers, Le Sars, martinpuich, Pozieres etc. all in 5 days. Went to bed at 10.30 P.M. the other crowd leaving then!</p>
<p>Tuesday 27th Aug.<br/>A quiet day with a few casualties from an 8th brigade push. News still good, he's falling back not being at his own leisure as it was during the old Somme days. Fixed up my store in the morning &amp; went along to the M.D.S, for dressings etc as several back dressing stations had been cleared out &amp; all the stuff brought forward, a wise move &amp; economical, I came across a lot of the stuff I handed over to the 3rd Fld a week or so ago. All prepared now for a stunt on a large scale but latest is that it may not come off. Letter received today from Syd very sad, he wrote it after our retreat &amp; was straining to enlist but still recognises his duty to himself &amp; family rather than to his own inclination. My letters from home are all typical of the writers, I know exactly what to expect before opening them. Syd's mildly political with mention</p>
