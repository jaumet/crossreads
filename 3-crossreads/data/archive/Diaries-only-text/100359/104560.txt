Saturday 17th 
The sun rose about 3 and we woke up and gazed on the land we were leaving. It was looking real well too. All the land around was under cultivation and the crops were looking well. The natives get to work early. They were busy gathering their crops and taking them to market, loaded on camels and donkeys. The girls and women were kept busy drawing water. We saw some fine looking girls tripping along with water jars on their heads. The Arabs on these outlying farms are much superior to the crowd that hang around our camps. We arrived in Alexandria at about 5 a.m. The natives met us with chocolates and cigarettes, as usual, and a new stunt they had changing money, which must have been a god thing for them. We went aboard the "Transylvania" at about 9. She is a fine big boat, but has a very bad name among the troops as a "starvation ship" There are about 3,000 of us aboard. And there is not too much room. We are all issued with Life Belts which have to be worn all day and slept in at night. Tea was the first meal we had aboard. It consisted of bread and butter. Not very "scrumptious" but a pleasant change from Bully Beef and Biscuits, and tea to drink. It was so hot and stuffy down below that we was allowed to put our blankets on the promenade deck. Last post was blown at 7.30 and "lights out" at 8. No smoking after tea is the hardest part. But, of course its better to do without a smoke than strike a match and attract a bloomin? hun submarine. Alexandria is a fine town, what we saw of it. The Harbor is full of shipping of all kinds. There are scores of yachts and little boats flying round. It puts one in mind of dear old Sydney. We soon got to sleep as we were tired out after our train journey.
