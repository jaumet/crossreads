<p>Sunday 31 March<br/>Still particularly quiet on the front, but it is said that there is a raid coming off to-night.  There is a German Labour Battn. holding the line opposite us. This month has been a month of wonders, &amp; the Ludendorff Offensive which now is twenty five miles deep from La Fere to Montdider, &amp; now the Germans are ten miles from Amiens &amp; can shell the Amiens-Paris railway. Prisoners are 70000 &amp; Guns 1100, according to Berlin &amp; in my opinion &amp; in spite of expressions to the contrary, the British High Command was caught napping. Then the new era in guns, the shelling of Paris from 75 miles distance, is a wonder to be wondered at.</p>
