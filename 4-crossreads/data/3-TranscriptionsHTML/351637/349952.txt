I had long forseen that such a course was inevitable, as the country has lost all confidence in him over the mistakes made by the navy in the early part of the war, his foolish uterances in public speeches, and above all the great Dardanelles fiasco. Now had Winston just left for the front quietly he would have at least earned the respect of the public and a good deal of sympathy. But this is not in his nature, and he chose instead to make a dramatic exit by delivering a farewell addres in the House on Monday November 15th defending his actions, and severely criticising both Lord Fisher and Lord Kitchener.</p>

I had intended to write a reply to the Prime Minister's speech, but my illness prevented me from doing any work at the time. But now feeling better I determined to haulWinston over the coals. I worked for the next two days and on Thursday November 18th sent in my letter to "The Times". On this day it was announcedmthat Winston had left for the front, amidst a chorus of acclamation on his patriotism, from the press.</p>
