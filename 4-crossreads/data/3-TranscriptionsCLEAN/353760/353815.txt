January 9, 1086.Two letters written:  one to Mother, one to Ron.  No mail in.
87.No papers today:  so the wild thing is told us - the papers have been suppressed in France by the Military - their contents are too startling.
From the Divy P.O. though, it's simply owing to mail falling back one day.
What will the next news be:  surely Lloyd George's speech should lead somewhere, by earlier speeches, if Germany had offered her speech first a haunting refusal would have been answered.
I'll to Swinburne, his "Songs Before Sunrise" beat Peace Talk - and a hundred conferences have been held here today - into cocked ridiculous rubbish - if there exists such rubbish.
January 1988.A day of pure dopiness.  A thaw set in during the night and mud thinly slimes the frozen ground.
Yarning awhile with George E. of M. Forrest - whom it appears Basil B. knows, and with Toby of the old Cairoian days.
No mail, and I'm looking forward to Pearse's "Rebel Sings" - the 2nd vol. of his collected stuff.
January 1189.This morning found the mail of yesterday with Les F. at the D.R.S.  A letter from C.W. Beaumont and a regret that "The Tragedy of Nan" was sold early last months.  A list of Cuala Press Books included "Selections from the writings of Lord Dunsany" - so wrote for it and for James Stephens "Five New Poems" - imagine & hope it's a "Flaying Flame" Chap. book.
Posted two letters to Mother and to Ron.
90.Payed:  so drew only 20F.  Cabled home for Twenty pounds - in hopes of a Paris leave.  Posted to Mrs. Hadley the two Beaumont Books - and parcelled ready the Moreland and Cuala books.
No mail today - where I'd anticipated the January "To-Day".
Rain in the air, and a poor grey day.
91.Rusty T. around this afternoon - & talking of our forming a book club:  to each, say, twelve of us, pay in 5F. and 2F. each pay:  to each be given the opportunity of listing books.  A meeting to be held shortly.  It is a good idea, and with the Motors carrying is a solved problem.
