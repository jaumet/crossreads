<p>harbor at Colombo, only a large breakwater built across the bay behind which the ships anchor. The port is a very busy one, while we were anchored,  ships were coming and going almost every hour. Since leaving we have had an exceptionally calm and cool voyage, and if the mythical gates of the inferno are no warmer than the realistic one at the entrance of the Red Sea they wont trouble me much. We have had a nice breeze all the way from Colombo and I havent felt the heat at all, but I daresay by my next letter I will have a different tale to tell of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>Tell Clarry and Percy that I will write them both a long letter as soon as I get properly settled down in Egypt. Will sign off now Ida trusting that Mother and Father and Aub are all in the best of health, with love. Your loving Bro<br/>Gordon</p>
<p>Don't forget my number 1647</p>
