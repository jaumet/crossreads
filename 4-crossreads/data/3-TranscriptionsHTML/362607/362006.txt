<p>Dear George,<br/>Will answer your letter later on. Have just a few minutes to get into bed before Lights Out.<br/>I am going to play Hockey this year instead of Football. It is a good game. I still  ride the Bike to Salisbury. It is O.K. as long as it does not rain or snow. I would not attempt it then.<br/>Had a letter from Fitzhough last mail. I have answered it. Give regards to all the Boys &amp; Remember me to OJ, Jim Ryan etc &amp; Mr Love.  Best wishes to all The Miles. Lily &amp; Her Mother &amp; boy &amp; yourself.   Harry</p>
