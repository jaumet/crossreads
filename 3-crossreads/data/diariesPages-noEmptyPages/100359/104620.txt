Monday 16th
Reveille at 7.30 Breakfast at 8. Then we fell in on the Parade and those who were short of any underclothing had their names taken. After this we spent a very interesting hour in recording our votes for or against conscription. I think from what I hear that the men at the front will vote "no" and that Billy Hughes will get rather a shock, when the results go back. Bricky Howard was tried this morning for a very peculiar crime. It appears that while we were at Armentieres, he threw a live bomb into the Dispensary where Maudie Newell and a few others were. Luckily, it didn't explode but it frightened about 10 years growth out of ?em. He was let off with 10 days. 2nd Fd.Pt. But in the opinion of B. Section he should have got 10 years, for not pulling the pin out. After dinner we went for a route march through this very pretty country, and we enjoyed it very much. Had another rotten night, thanks to my cold.
Tuesday 17th 
This morning we had breakfast at 7.30 and as we have no parade, till 1.30 we got busy getting our packs ready for the March. Fell in outside our billet and marched to Parade ground where we fooled around for about an hour before marching off on our way to "the Somme" It is some time since we had our full packs up and their weight soon brought out the sweat on the manly brows of the 8th. We passed a beautiful chateau quite the finest place I have seen in France. The grounds were surrounded by a double row of trees and there was a glorious avenue about 300 yds. leading up to the chateau and the gardens and lawns looked fine. The chateau itself is built of bricks painted white, with a red tiled roof. We arrived at "Baileul" about 4.30 in the pouring rain and it was mighty cold too. Women and Kids were selling cakes and fruit and did a roaring trade as we were all very hungry.
