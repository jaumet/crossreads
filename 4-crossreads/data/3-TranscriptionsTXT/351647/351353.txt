 Field 3 March 
 Dear Mrs. Jack, 
 Of course you'll be calling me some of your high toned names &amp; in a way I deserve it as it is quite weeks since I last wrote but I simply haven't had a show.  I simply had to let letters slide. 
 You see I had a big job on &amp; simply had to go for dear life night and day. 
 Had eight assistants, had six of them in a big dug out &amp; 2 down here (where I sleep) &amp; as I had to slave drive to get the job finished I couldn't sort of set a bad example &amp; write letters or the staff would have  started  reckoned it was an easy job &amp; started writing letters too &amp; it would have taken weeks to finish.  It rather worried me &amp; I used to feel rather dead every morning. 
 However the work is practically over, 6 of the assistants have departed, some I'm afraid with bitter thoughts towards me as I lost my temper at times &amp; said biting &amp; sarcastic remarks.  Just blew off at them so to speak.
