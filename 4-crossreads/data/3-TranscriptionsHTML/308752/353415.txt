<p>February 1st 1917<br/>Who should I meet to day but Lieut. Grieves an old school mate of mine. He is in charge of the baths which were close at hand,. He kindly gave me a new set of underclothes. It was a great relief to be free from <u>chats</u> once again.</p>
<p>February 2nd 1917</p>
<p>Great news to hand this morning. <u>A. Section Bearers</u> are to report at a Rest Station which our Unit has taken over. All were pleased with this order as we are going well away from the Straffe. It was rather a pleasant walk our <u>packs</u> &amp; blankets were <u>carried</u> for us/   arrived at our destination about 1 p.m. The Rest Station is a big one, over a thousand patients living there. I suppose we will all  be doing nursing duties, I can see plenty of work ahead, but is a home, no stretcher bearing etc-, during the night bombs were dropped from an aeroplane near the camp, no damage was done.</p>

<p>It will be quite unnecessary for me to write up each day for the past six weeks, as the same old routine</p>
