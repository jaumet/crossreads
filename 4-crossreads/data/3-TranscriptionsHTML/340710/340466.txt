<p>10th August 1915.<br/>We have just come through the hardest and fiercest fighting we have had yet.  Its started on the 6th inst when we attacked at Lone Pine, a position which was said to be impregnable.  Right from the beginning it was practically hand to hand fighting all the time.  Our Brigade had the honor of the attack and everything worked out as arranged and we reached our objective without a great number of casualties but holding on was the trouble, the Turk came time and time again but we drove him off but their bombing was very severe and our trenches became crowded with wounded.<br/>Further up the coast at Suvla</p>
