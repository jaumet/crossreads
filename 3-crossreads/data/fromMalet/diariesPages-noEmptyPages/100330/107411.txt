arrived at the Hospital my attention was drawn by a Corporal who pointed out Fritz in the light, as soon as the Search lights picked him up, what a cannonading there were, Anti Air Craft Machine Guns were fireing from all directions. The Shells were bursting all around him, it was a beautiful Sight, The aeroplane in the light looked like a huge Silver Bird gliding along, he was making straight for the Hospital then he turned and made for Poperinghe soon was lost in the dark. Having shown my Order at the Hospital I was directed to a Motor Car the Driver brought me back to the Depot for the Sick Man. On our arrival at the Depot, there were great excitement two of Fritz's Machines could be heard up over head, they dropped several Bombs in the Bush then they were picked up by the lights off they went dropping Bombs, One Bomb exploded in the Royal Engineers Camp 268 Company Killed 5 Tommies wounded 20 others, rather a strange thing the 5 who were killed ran out of their Tent when
