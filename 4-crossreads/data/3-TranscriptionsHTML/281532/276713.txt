<p>29/9/18 Marquaix</p>
<p>Dawn was heralded by an intense bombardment which dwindled off into the sustained rattle <strike>of</strike> &amp; rumble of the heavies later in the morning. A fine clear day. The bivouacs turn out to be not so bad after all &ndash; dug in to little banks and sunken hedges round a hillside. Many of the men slept on the grass and pulled their trench shelters over themselves &amp; their blankets. General Robertson was round and said the Americans succeeded in their attack this morning after a little trouble on the left. A very large gun of ours is firing from the railway near Marquaix this morning. A few big shells came to hand from Fritz occasionally. Took a walk up on to the high ground near the camp and got a good birdseye view of the countryside. On the horizon was smoke of shell bursts.</p>
