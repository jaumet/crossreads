 Return to London visit Mrs Caper 
 Clapham Common

 Off to Birmingham tonight stay for the night at the Grand Hotel. Birmingham is a very busy place, but is made up of nearly all industrial houses. Some of the suburbs are very nice

 Walk round the Black Country which in the vastness of its works is a revelation to me. See Lea-Brook Wednesbury Bilston Smithwick have indeed an interesting time.

 Back in London. Stay at Strand Palace Hotel.
Thursday 12
 At the Opera this evening. Tristram Islode at Drury Lane which is gorgeous. Go to camp at Perham Downs tomorrow.
 Tea with Mrs Capes, Clapham Com.

 In camp at Perham Downs. It is pretty rotten being back in camp after having the last two months in luxury comparatively.
 However things are not too bad the food is eatable.
