town of Vignacourt to an aerodrome which is used as a theatre. Electric light and painted scenery. Lecture by General Sir Francis Younghusband KCSG, KCG on Thibet and the Himalayas – a fine interesting talk from an elderly man who knows his subject. The ‘drome was crowded. Generals Wisdom and Martin were also there. Afterwards a fast canter home passing through the Forest of Vignacourt now getting its desolate winter look. The ground mist rising from the Somme valley was like wreaths of fog. It was dark on reaching the Chateau at 5 pm. Sat in the anteroom of the mess and read papers and wrote until mess time. A day of outdoor work today and a keen appetite and tired muscles are the result. The chestnut tugs like the devil. Warm fire very agreeable this cold night.
