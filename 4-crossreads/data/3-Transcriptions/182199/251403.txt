<p>My dear Uncle Phil</p>
<p>It is with the deepest regret I am now writing to you to give what few details I have been able to gather about poor Laurence&#39;s death. &nbsp;We were attacked on the morning of the 19th inst:&nbsp;by the Turks about 4 a.m. and it was about this time &nbsp;roughly&nbsp;that Laurence was killed. &nbsp;I am told that Laurence was - in keeping his men in good spirits and directing their fire - exposing himself and not in the least&nbsp;worrying about any danger. &nbsp;When daylight came the enemy were able to direct their machine guns on us &amp; it was then I understand Laurence met his death. &nbsp;I never heard anything about it until the following day, so was awfully cut up at not having a chance of going to the funeral. &nbsp;I went down and saw his grave &amp; on it was a bunch of wild flowers which the Padre told me had been placed there by the men of his company who I might mention were very fond</p>
