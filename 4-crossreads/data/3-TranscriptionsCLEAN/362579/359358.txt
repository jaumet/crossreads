  
 snaps,  some are very good but others awful (Do   &  me in our Kiminos). 
 I think we shall be happier here. The girls   &  matron are brighter - It is not such a pretty spot but healthier. The other one was fearful damp   &  cold - made me feel very throaty but better already. 
 Had a note from Norman yesterday   &  he was leaving for Australia next morn.
