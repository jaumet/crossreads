a mad old letter isn't it.  I must collect myself.
Merci beaucoup pour votre trois lettres (yes there were three not two, 39, 40 & 41).  You really are a brick.  I'm sorry if my letters don't arrive regularly & up to time but believe muh I do write to you every chance I get & with ma petite merc much much oftener than anyone else.  The mails are mad both ways I think.  Things are fair as I said it has been freezy again but today was a thaw, a real spring day & the feel of spring is here.  I want to write music badly & simply beautiful things that no one has ever thought of before have been hurtling through my nut & I have had to go & talk about pay books & allotments to wives &c. &c.
Things are still good with us but its no good talking of them as by the time you get this lots it will all be stale & lots more will have happened.  At present things our way look pretty good and promising.
