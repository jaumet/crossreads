<p>1st March (Wednesday)<br/>Very warm. Stretcher drill in morning, heavy work that made us too tired to do anything in afternoon. Luckily enough we were not asked to. Today a list of Cairo leave came out but unfortunately I have to wait till near the last. Orders were issued this morning with reference to respecting the graves of fallen men and we were warned not to touch the various burial places. As usual some ruffians are bound to hunt for curios so it has to be stopped in future.</p>
