  
 [Friday 19 May 1916] 
 Marched out at 3.30 AM & saw a sight I have not seen since Elands River fight- rows & rows of dead horses & Camels -graves of Turks & Yeomanry- at  Quatia  Camp equipment & love letters Captured 12 sheep & 8 Bedouins but noTurks. [Following paragraph is crossed out] Everything left in the Yeomans Camps- Blankets Helmets &  Polo Balls !!   Golf sticks!!  great Tables & ovens & Whiskey & Champagne bottles & we poor devils can hardly get drinking water carried it is not to the Credit of the Regiment.  I have  NOT  mentioned 12 Hours in the saddle, could hear Warships bombarding further up the Coast but I must be careful what I write. Some of the Photos & letters were disgustingly indecent.
