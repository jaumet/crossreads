<p>Zeitoun at last, filthy dirty &amp; tired. Ate tin of officer's biscuits oranges &amp; apples &amp; even cucumbers. Down to the railway we tore &amp; emptied the lorry &amp; then I struck guard. Craige was left at the camp. I was feeling hungry too, but could not get relieved, so I got on another transport &amp; went back to camp, to find everything in chaos. Men were everywhere, &amp; nothing could be found. I had lost my gear and could not find anybody Well, in a case like this, there is but one thing to do &amp; that is to look to one's self &amp; hang the gear. I got two biscuits &amp; a cup of tea after a lot of begging &amp; then turned into bed before more trouble came. My eyes were bloodshot &amp; so sore that I could not close them, &amp; my hands were cut about a lot. Our beds were thrown out any where at all. Mine in the stables. I slept more soundly than I ever did before &amp; awoke at 5 am'</p>
<p>4/3/16<br/>To start work again. after breakfast of the eternal bully beef &amp; biscuits  we marched down to Zeitoun siding &amp; began loading trucks. The amount of gear was enormous &amp; filled two train loads whilst we were there. Naturally the officers must have their pot palms &amp; lounges  &amp; these made a big heap. We had to burn our gear that was not absolutely necessary. 5 inch howitzers &amp; field ambulances wagons galore.</p>
<p>At 11.30 we tore out of Zeitoun bound for Tel - el- Kebir. There was no stop all the way except at Zag-a-Zig for water. Cattle trucks were our apartments &amp; were fairly rough too but one does not object to these things when there is some object in doing so. At 2pm arrive at Tel-el-Kebir &amp; begin to unload. Have a row with Ryan over  guard, Take guard from 8pm to 10pm. Clouds of dust flying about, no bread no tea, in fact, nothing to eat &amp; not even a drop of water. Feel dirty &amp; hungry. After 10pm I crawl under some old tents &amp; boxes &amp; go to sleep, as I find late on a stack of  picks  &amp; shovels.</p>
<p>5/4/16<br/>Awake 6am &amp; find nothing to eat again. Flies crawl over us in thousands &amp; torment us</p>
