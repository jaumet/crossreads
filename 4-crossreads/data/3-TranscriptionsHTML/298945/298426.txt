<p>Chip<strike>p</strike>illy was pointed out to me yesterday   Facing the line (that is looking towards Peronne) one has bare hills at the back, in front, &amp; on the right; while on the left is the valley of the Somme a kilometre away, &amp; just beyond Cerisy. This is wooded along its whole course as it flows away towards Peronne, &amp;, in addition on this side it has a line of cliffs following it &amp; then receding &amp; running at right angles to it &amp; in front of us. Between this line of cliffs where it runs in front of us beyond the opposing hill, is the village of Chipilly. It is possible to mark its position by the wrecked roof of the church which is just discernible on our left front, in a fold of the opposing hill. <strike>Round about</strike></p>
<p>From this village to the wooded hills on the <strike>left</strike> opposite bank of the Somme, represents the section where the Germans made</p>
