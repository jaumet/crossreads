<p>The following day I am appointed mess-orderly. This duty is one which gains for you the respect of your fellow-men, and admiration also if you can manage to &quot;snare&quot; an extra loaf occasionally. The duties appertaining to the position comprise the fetching from the cook-house of the &quot;dixies&quot; containg stew and tea&nbsp;(a &quot;dixie&quot; I might mention is a large military saucepan, with a handle over the top). After the meal is over the mess-orderly has to carry the said &quot;dixie&quot; to a set of troughs and thoroughly cleanse them both inside and outside, having first emptied any balance remaining in them to the tanks provided for&nbsp;that purpose, and then return the &quot;dixies&quot; to the cook-house, the cook inspecting them, and I can tell you the cook is a particular sort of chap. The poor mess-orderly has to rush around then and wash himself, and be on parade the same time as the other fellows. No excuse is made for the time it takes him to carry out his duties. Only one tank of hot water was supplied at this time, and about 30 or 40 mess-orderlies were requiring it at the same time.</p>
<p>I held this position fo a week, and no-one seemed very keen in trying to get the job from me. By the end of the week my dungarees were just a mess of grease.</p>
<p>A fellow was crimed if he returned a dirty dixie to the cook-house.</p>
<p>My first day as mess orderly started very ominously. The tea at breakfast had no sugar in it. The stew at dinner had no salt in it. Being of a superstitious nature, I wondered what the third thing wrong would be.</p>
<p>Soon after dinner we were all called out to the parade ground and fell-in as usual. The Officer-in-charge then told those of us who occupied hut 18 to fall-out and proceed to the said hut and collect our belongings including the blankets, and bring them out with us to the parade ground and fall-in again. This being completed he told us to fall-out on the left, then form two-deep and we were marched down to hut Number 14, as 18 was required</p>
