<p>January, 1915<br/>Monday 25<br/>Out of sight of land again. The Red Sea is between 80, &amp; 100 miles wide here, &amp; the Arabian Coast is a hostile one.<br/>We pass several P &amp; O boats en route Australia &amp; Singapore &amp; I wish I was able to send you greetings by them.<br/>Nights are very bright now &amp; heavy dew falls &ndash; We have lost the Southern Cross &amp; have instead the Great Bear &amp; the North Star.<br/>Regret to say 4 of my men refused to be vaccinated &amp; must be sent back &amp; replaced by others.<br/>Later above men changed their minds.</p>
