<p>31st.    Last night a most wonderful thing happened to me a messenger came down &amp; said that Capt Mackenzie wanted to see me I thought at the time that it was something about my second stripe he wanted, but when I got to him he told me the Colonel wanted to see me at Headquarters at once, what on earth is the matter now I thought; as I went round, arrived there I reported at once &amp; the Colonel told me to wait a little &amp; he would see me, there was another chap waiting there also &amp; he had been sent round for the same as I had after a little time the Adjutant came outside &amp; called me in, I entered</p>
