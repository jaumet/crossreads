<p>grow in the Laboratory &amp; I arranged to have a marconigram sent on after us with a report. In this way we got a message 800 miles out from Capetown reporting the names of 6 "carriers" who were promptly isolated on the poop deck aft. We had 2 other cases which developed later but anyway by the time we reached England the health of the troops was excellent &amp; I think we were jolly lucky to get off so well.<br/>I do not think there is anything in this letter needing censoring. With Kindest remembrances to you &amp; Mrs Ferguson &amp; Dorothy &amp; hoping <strike>to</strike> you are all well, I remain Yours sincerely M M [indecipherable] Sinclair</p>
