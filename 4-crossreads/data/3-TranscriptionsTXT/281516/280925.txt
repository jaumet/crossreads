All men left on fatigue rising at 3 am and all was quiet here during the morning. Furphys that we move 10 miles north up towards St Eloi are confirmed and we commence preparations. Went to Batt H.Q. at 3 pm and then came back with Curinow and Andrew. Some shells burst round Andrew's dugouts and then over the communication trench we had just come out of.
Some complaints about the rations again more especially the breakfast owing to shortage of bacon. Each man is entitled to 4 ozs and our issue yesterday included large bones in the weight. This is not much good to the men who have to go out and work on a comparatively empty stomach. Intend having Groves up tonight and discussing the matter.
Paraded young Payne, - the little jockey boy aged only 16 who has been getting the into trouble a bit lately. Some older men who ought know better delight in getting the young devil drunk and are going about the right way to spoil him. I gave him a good dressing down about getting a bad character that would make his parents ashamed of him and it is to be hoped he pulls himself up.
The coal issue here contains a good deal of sulphur and gives off fumes when burning. The smelly poison gas is not a smell of chlorine but rather one of sulphur.
All information here commences as furphy and more often than not comes quite true. Two persistent rumours have been going round 1. that we are to be withdrawn & form a mobile reserve. 2 that we march down to trenches 10 miles north. The latter is quite correct but still an official secret. A week before anyone knew of the evacuation of Anzac, the rumour to that effect was strong & Tel el Kebir named as our next camp. All quite true.
