I can hear the heavy firing quite distinctly down on the "Somme" the vibration in the air is easily felt everything seems quivering
Have had quite a busy day what with booking inspecting all the firing bays arranging for the supply of bombs etc. getting the fatigue partes together, making a dump for the "crater snatching" partys tools cutting the barb wire into proper lengths for tonights wiring party over seering a lot of the little jobs inspecting all gas helmets I have had scarce a minute for myself.
28th. D Coy had 1 man killed 2 wounded last night on their wiring party, Dave Mason I put ours out, got in safely.
