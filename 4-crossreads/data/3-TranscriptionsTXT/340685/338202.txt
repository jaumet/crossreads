thinking about.29.6.16 Party of infantry working for us all day and they were a very lazy crowd. Our dugouts are going to be rebuilt soon and we have our eyes on a new one ready floored and very comfortable bar a leaking roof. Got a paper to-day and very good news in it of the Italians and Russians. Germans fired a few shells to-day presumably with the idea of getting the range of some guns that have been giving him trouble. Had a chat with Tonkin our section clerk to-night and he seems to have had numerous parcels. Photos of his sisters - very chingy.30.6.16 Usual routine. Party of infantry working - same crowd. Shifting dirt for the trenches. Our men advanced 350 yards at La Bassee and also at the other end of the bend thus straightening up the horseshoe bend. A big naval gun assisted in the preliminary bombardment for the first time - said to be a 14" gun. In the evening about 6 the air was full of our planes 18 going off towards Lille probably for a raid of some sort. They got shrapnel pretty hot but I saw no one hit. The planes were supposed  to be mainly big new Vickers Battle planes. In the evening till dark I made myself a stretcher of wire netting and hessian and went to bed tired. We are moving our dugout one lower down vacated by Sarre & Linton. It is quite ready but has a leaky and not very thick roof. Didn't sleep too well.1.7.16 Had to take the side supports off my bed to make it fit the doorway and finished it to-night and it is very comfortable. Worked hard all day shovelling while the infantry of the 2nd Batt loafed. They go into billets at Fleurbaix to-night & Higgy shook them up on their loafing. Paid at 1 o'clock. After tea hustled round and moved my belongings and now everything is spick and span. Another fleet of planes went over about 7 and hovered above the German lines for about 15 minutes 7 went over and all returned they being under shrapnel all the time. A taube which was up was attacked by one of our planes which was unsuccessful in heading Fritz off and he descended safely. Very interesting though short duel. Taubes been active all day over us as it was such a fine day. After shave and a good wash went to bed and read my letters. Got 4. One from Eileen, Kathleen and 2 from mother
