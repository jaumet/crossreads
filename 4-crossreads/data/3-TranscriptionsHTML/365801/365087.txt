<p>pals for the sociable whisk.  Eric Fisher dug him out &amp; fetched him along.  All the officers of a certain battalion whose back hair we were parting with 18 prs for a few weeks when they came out were great stickers for this battery &amp; as they are in the next billet in reserve for a bit are keen on coming &amp; watching when we are beefing it in.  I am pleased to say that much of the infantry don't regard us as a fancy corps &ndash; no mans land is very narrow where they were and its anxious work knocking Fritz's parapet but their Col. who is a fine cove &amp; loves his men used to sool me on &amp; chance it.</p>

He told me some time ago that Ferguson J's son Capt. was killed the day before in a dugout &ndash; after he had been flattened 3 or 4 times by blast of big shells without his nerves showing a trace of it.  Jolly hard luck wasnt [it].  I feel most awfully sorry for the Judge.<br/>Oh, Weston is the Doc for a battalion just come in on front.  Masters was sleeping in his dugout &amp; told me about a Yankee Doc. Weston?  Yes, I will be up there soon as I came to see the Colonel &amp; will look him up &amp; in fact I am</p>
