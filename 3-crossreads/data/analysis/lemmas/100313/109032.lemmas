 6/1/18 Queen Hotel Penzanc Arms at Newlyn and there had some fri ham potato bread and cider for 1/5 and the good wife said the food question was acut . Had a look round Moorab Garden and Market Jew St . in Penzanc . An ordinari countri town this as far as one can judg . Sunday and wet have combin to make thing dull and as it doe not look like clear up I decid to leav for Taunton in the morn . On the Esplanad about 3.30 a fair number of peopl were promenad . Outsid one shop notic a coupl of dog bowl mark R.S.P.C.A! ! A dull grey sea roll in , dull low cloud , headland cliff hid in mist , such are my day 's impress . Dine at 7.30 in that solemn state so dear to the Englishman and then turn turn into bed earli .
