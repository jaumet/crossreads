1917 APRIL
22 SUNDAY
Fine & beautifully sunny &
warm. Cleaning harness
all day. Leave was granted
in afternoon to about 40%
& most of them went to a place
called "Desveres" about 6
kilos away. I got news from
mother that Alan had been
missing since 14th of the
month. I only hope that he
has not had any serious
accident, but has only been compelled to land in the
Hun lines. Lord grant that
thats all that has happened
He had just gained his
captaincy & been recommended
for the Military Cross. Its
rotten how all the best
are taken.
