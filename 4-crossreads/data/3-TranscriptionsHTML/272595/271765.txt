<p>23rd   Good news from Palestine this morning &amp; once again the "Aussies" are in the limelight theres scarcely a day passes without them being mentioned somewhere or other.<br/>Got a letter from Len today saying that he would probably be going home to "Aussie" by the end of the month, he's lucky enough for anything &amp; all I hope is that he gets away, I am making every effort now to get back to the Batt. for I would get mine right off.  Went over to the OTB. this <strike>morning</strike> evening &amp; while there a big argument rose as to when certain units were entitled to put their chevrons up it ended in a bet &amp; I am holding the money &amp; also wrote to Horsferry Rd to have it settled.<br/>24th.   Bright &amp; lovely morning but the afternoon has been a failure</p>
