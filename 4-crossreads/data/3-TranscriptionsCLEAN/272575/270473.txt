When I wrote Last acknowledging your letter, which had just reached me, enclosed in one from Overstrand, I did not have time to reply in detail, or to give you very much information, except that I was O.K. and on my way to the front line looking for stoush.    That was sometime ago, and as you will see by the above address conditions have changed a little, for my part, but it will not be for very long.   "I suppose I had better, tell you what Little there is to tell, as briefly as possible, so I will start at the beginning.   After writing that note, we handed, our packs over to the Q.M.S. and cleaned our rifles, and did various other little things, that were necessary, before moving up, we moved off that night, and hit the Line about, 11.30 P.M. after struggling through mud, which our Reporters would describe, as "Adhesive, and of a sticky nature"    "The boys have quite a different method of naming it - We took over our part of the Line, and settled down to enjoy our stay there, which we were told might be of six or seven days duration, we felt as happy as a mud-lark would, if you put him out in the middle of the Sahara, in midsummer, I remarked before that we settled down. - That was correct we went knee deep in some parts of the Trench, and eventually had to evacuate and only hold the drier parts.   Twas was great fun ..
