<p>Monday 7 May 1917</p>
<p>This morning we all went through GAS fumes with Helmets on a suffocating business. Enemy bombed Hospitals during night &amp; Killed &amp; wounded many. From the Outpost here today I could see the train leaving Beersheba. We will have a lot of hard fighting ere we enter Jerusalem. As a chance occurs I'll post this. <strike>Love to all</strike></p>
