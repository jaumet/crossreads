<p>We are abreast of Marybro (Double Island) as I write this &ndash; Sunday eveg or Monday morning seems about our time &ndash; all being well &ndash;<br/>The more one reflects the more one sees that the Pacific is washed out &ndash; The Grantala is discharged &ndash; The Submarine AE2 has gone home &ndash; All Imperial!! Naval men (Why Imperial, why not British?) have been recalled &ndash; One destroyer only is in Sydney we believe &ndash; No war ships are here &ndash; What on earth is left for us to do? Nothing save dull, deadly, ordinary routine &ndash; I'm off =<br/>Talking things over with others I touched on a point that many agree with &ndash; Is it a good thing to denude Australia of its fighting men in toto? &ndash; especially of its volunteer crowd &ndash; we can &amp; may do it but is it advisable in a young land which wants population? &ndash; Why not compel the villages of the cities of Great B &amp; Ireland to drill &amp; fight &amp; save our men for their own country &ndash; There must be tens of thousands of hoodlums at home who should be rounded up, trained &amp; given a fighting chance &ndash;</p>
