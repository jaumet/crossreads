  
 When England calls for men!  More men! each day. I would be base were I to bid him stay, But I am just - a mother - Lord, and oh! It simply breaks my heart to let him go - Because I'm human, Lord, my tears must flow. But joy and pride reign o'er my grief to-day, With words of cheer I'll speed him on his way. For they across the sea, they need him so, Oh, son!  To save my honour, you must go!
