28thLeft the base in charge of a draft of 94 men and the 3 officers for our Reinforcement camp.
29thReached the Rein. Wing here at Pernois about 90.30 A.M. and handed over my draft.
30thThe weather is very hot and muggy.  Went off today to see the 4th Army School of Cookery.  Had a first rate meal and went into Abbeville, had tea at the officers Rest House and returned after a long dusty and hot ride in a motor lorry which has been out since Mons and had seen about 12 years on London Streets before the war.  It is wonderful the amount of work which can be got out of these old busses.
