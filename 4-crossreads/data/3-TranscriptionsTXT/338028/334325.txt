 Sunday 4th June Alongside us is the 1st L H Bde transport camp and some of my old mates are there, we have some great yarns of old times, finished my send off and built the dispensary, then partitioned half the tent off for a hospital and put two patients in it. Swam twice in the canal, we do not care if the reg. does not come back for a month. 
 Monday 5th June As soon as we awoke news came of a terrific Naval Battle in the Nth Sea, in which we did not come off too well our losses were about equal but we lose some fine ships including Queen Mary, details are not yet to hand. 
 Went for a ride to Kantara, heat became awful, one of the hottest days I have yet seen in Egypt made our swim more appreciated. 
 Tuesday 6th June The sweet water canal runs alongside us and the Indian Lancers catch enormous fish Bream 4 and 5 lbs weight, they give them to us and they are delighted, walked over the weir to-day. We now learn that the German High Seas Fleet was driven back on to its own mine fields and lost a lot more ships besides those reported.
