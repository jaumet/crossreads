<p>1918<br/>Aug<br/>One evening we heard a plane making a queer noise, so looked out of the dugout. one of  our planes bad engine and was just over our joint about 20 feet up. He made for a nice sloping piece of ground, but when he got close, he saw that it was full of barbed wire. he touched the earth &ndash; bounced and touched the earth again right on top of the next line of barbed wire. It caught his landing wheels and tipped him straight over. he was about 500 yards away from us by this time. We ran up but by the time we had arrived he had crawled out from underneath the machine. Lighting a cigarette he walked away saying that a lorry would call later for his bus. Some of the troops immediately crawled under the fuselage to see if any souvenirs were to be procured. One wit tried to remove the clock by unscrewing the screws with his knife. Just then an officer turned up and he had to desist.<br/>26 Aug<br/>On 26 August we packed up again and started</p>
