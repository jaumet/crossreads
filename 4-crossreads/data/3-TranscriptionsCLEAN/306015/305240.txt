 June 30.   Too wet for parade.    Alan & I took a short walk around the camp.   We examined an old aeroplane, a six inch reserve howitzer and a four-wheel drive motor lorry, by way of curiosity.   The evening again found our happy family, like sardines, in the tent.   Heavy firing continued all night. 
 July 1 Sunday.   Church Parade in the open-air.   The day was cold & inclined to be wet & we stayed in the tent most of the time, "arguing the toss" about one thing and another.   After tea I went looking for Fritz bullets etc. as souvenirs "de la guerre".   There are hundreds of German bullets, shells, bombs, etc etc everywhere & I only wish I had some means of sending them home. 
 July 2   Drill again, in fact , "interum iterumque"
