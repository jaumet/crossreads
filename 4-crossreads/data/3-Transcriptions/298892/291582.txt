<p>6<br/>Larkhill,<br/>10th September 1916.</p>
<p>Dear Mother/.<br/>I received your last letter while we were bivouaced at Shrewton, about 10 miles from here, and it came as a very welcome surprise, I had no idea any mail would be delivered out there. It is something unusual for the A.M.C. to be compelled to attend route marches and this was only the second one on which we accompanied the infantry.<br/>We set out on Wednesday a lovely morning for exercise - brisk and cold - and we soon worked up a grateful warmth. We each carried our lunch, a slice of bread and cheese, in our knapsacks and ate it by the roadside. At arrival at our destination the infantry had to start trench-digging, while we amused ourselves pitching our tent and attending a few unfortunates with blistered feet and chafed legs.<br/>That night we were called out at 9 p.m. to attend an imaginary night attack on the trenches. We marched about two miles off without making the slightest noise and then spread out and advanced on the trenches in extended order like an army of phantoms. Everything is done without the slightest sound. Anyone talking is immediately reprimanded and one who coughs out is more severely dealt with. When any orders are required they are passed along the line from mouth to mouth</p>
