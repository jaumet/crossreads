Capt Mckenzie came back from England this morning we were all very pleased to see him, I hope he takes over the Company, though I can't complain about Mr Edgely he has treated me alright, but Capt McKenzie is a rare sport is very popular with the Battalion.
Had a short lecture this afternoon on danger of frost bite for the temperature at present is very low something like 10 below zero if you don't keep moving something is likely to happen.
Took over Battalion Orderly Sergeant for B. Coy tonight they are short of Sergts.
Made out a complete nominal roll of my platoon today this involves a fair amount of writing
