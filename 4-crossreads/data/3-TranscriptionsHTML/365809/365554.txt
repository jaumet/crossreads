<p>Dear Mother and Father<br/>There is really nothing to write about and being now in a sppt where nothing is likely to hit me except perhaps a motor car in the street. I feel inclined to get rather less keen than ever on writing letters.</p>
<p>The school goes on swimmingly. We are doing everything, Drill, Musketry Bayonet fighting, Tactics, Court Martial and all. The time seems to go very quickly, each week end we are free from 12 on Saturday till Monday morning. This week I went up to London and went to a theatre. Listened to a raid alarm and came back on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>I see Beiers a good deal. I was to go and dine with him and his little wifie to-night but it had to be postponed till to-morrow He is dining with me on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The weather here has been perfect and the place is awfully pretty.</p>
<p>Rochford is having a splendid time. He does about half an hour's work a day. Nothing else.<br/>Best love<br/>Your Affec. Son<br/>C.R.Lucas</p>
