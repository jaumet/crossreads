Many blondes among the clean looking quietly dressed and natural complexioned girls. The men (many squareheaded) wore good civilian clothes, though one officer was in uniform and carried a sword. Noticed several older men with cheeks much disfigured with duel scars - the number of spectacle wearers is alone remarkable. One sees few children under 5 and no babies. The infant mortality is said to have been very high. The Opera was Mignon which was excellently staged and acted and the music was lovely. Dined at the crowned Officers Club and then returned to Dom Hotel to write and bed.
