23/2/18 Selles
Called by batman (Charlesworth) at 7 am and at 8 was abroad to see B D Coys ready to match off to the rifle range at Lottingen. Then round to the mess for some breakfast. At 9 am held orderly room and tried a few cases of AWL and overstaying leave. Then did some writing prior to attending conference at BdeHq. Rode down there with Carrick and saw General Paton and Colonels Brazenor James. A good and interesting conference rather different to some we have attended. The General had some figures of interest re man power. We also while here fixed up the question of previous Brigade Sports. Back to my billet for some lunch
