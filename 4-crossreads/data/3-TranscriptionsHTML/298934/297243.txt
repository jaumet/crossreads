<p>Thursday <strike>8</strike> 29th April 1915</p>
<p>Joined my own bn. &amp; dug in.  Men joining bn. from all points.  Reorganising.  Many of my pals dead.  Tommy Bell, a sig., was struck with shrapnel early on Sunday.  Tommy Glew through back of head &amp; into r-eye.  Moved out of our dug out to another spot.  We found by experience that it was too exposed to shrapnel, spending a very bad 10 mins.  Worked late &amp; made another dug out.  Just as we finished Bert Travers was picked upon to help dig another trench in the firing line.  Woke up midnight, &amp; got equipment, on to move but told we should move in the morning so went to</p>
