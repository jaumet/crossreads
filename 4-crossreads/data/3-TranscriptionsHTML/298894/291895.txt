<p>amongst the New Zealanders I walked to the next camp called Zeitoun another mile off after enquiries was fortunate enough to find him as sergeant major in the A.S.C &amp; very cocky &amp; comfortable looking as usual. He was of course very surprised to see me as I was him. Back to camp for dinner and as no ration yet issued  purchased some outside. Then I decided to go to mens camp to see Will D. &amp; arrived out there about 5 oclock &amp; had my first sight of the Nile &amp; pyramids on the way out I passed a huge swarm of grasshoppers huge in size &amp; so thick as to form a cloud.    I had no pass but managed to pass the guard &amp; found Will at his tea &amp; joined him to his great surprise.  After a good yarn I returned to Camp once more coming in the back way as before.</p>

Men lead the way singing the [indecipherable] comes next followed by some women folk  At night was conducted round the native quarter &amp; witnessed sights innumerable.  Dancing Singing etc.  quite 2 miles  I passed of dens etc all with their solitary women of different nationalities from black to white.  Returned at night to find some of our chaps sent to their various units</p>
