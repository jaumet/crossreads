<p>I stayed at Southmead 6 weeks.  One afternoon when I was convalescent I went out to a party with twenty other Australians.  Mr. Holman gave the party in his house, that was how Eileen found me.  They used to come up to my ward after that to see me.  After that I went to the Convalescent camp at Epsom and spent 2 months getting my shoulder massaged and my teeth done.  I also got them to treat the old bad leg with electricity which didn't do it any harm.  I had my furlough and here I am dying to get away again, by jove I'll be a useless brute when I get home, the army is spoiling me for hard work and staying in the one place.</p>
