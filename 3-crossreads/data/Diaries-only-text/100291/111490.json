Feb. Sunday 4 1917
Nothing of import happens. The usual shelling takes place. I'm put on to help in Dressing Room as far as back allows. Still sore painful to move about. More changing over of posts. Remainder of B Sec. changed places with A. 
Heavy frosts still continue, this possie is a cold miserable hole. The dugout is wet our rations scarce.
