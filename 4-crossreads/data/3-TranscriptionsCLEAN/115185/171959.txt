pain and death & loss of dear ones - the nations are purified and then again one remembers the tremendous amount of immorality, in thieving and injustice to thousands - and the wasters of humanity left and the flowers of manhood taken. It all jumbles up in ones mind and thinking and judging and deciding and thinking over again goes on without end - and one turns thankfully to ones manual work and the petty daily sorrows and worries of those one is working for - glad that there is always work waiting, that thinking and deciding are unecessary - that one must sleep & wash & make one's bed daily - now salutary to the mind are these necessities.Well I must stop writing or else you'll be bored. I wish Lady Allen was here.Your devoted daughterBetha
