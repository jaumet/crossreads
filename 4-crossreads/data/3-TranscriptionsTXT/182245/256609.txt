 4 WEDNESDAY 
 Fine but dull &amp; we had a 
 storm of sleet in afternoon 
 Cleaning things round stables 
 ect all morning &amp; we went 
 up the river (Lys) &amp; grazed 
 the horses for a couple of hours 
 in afternoon. Pay parade 
 in eveninv. We are paid 
 at the rate of 1 franc = 8&frac12; d &nbsp;&amp; 
 all the civilian people reckon 
 1 franc = 10 d &nbsp;so we make 1&frac12; d  
 on each franc. I got two 
 letters from father 26 th &nbsp;Mar &amp;&nbsp; 
 6 th &nbsp;Feb. &amp; a letter 26 Jan &amp; a 
 &quot;Bulletin&quot; from Linda.
