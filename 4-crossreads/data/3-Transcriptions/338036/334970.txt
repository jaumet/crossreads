<p>Saturday 20th [Oct]<br/>Before the MO this morning.  Still to continue with the wet dressings.  Wound looks very much better.  Played house in the afternoon but no success.  This was the first occasion of my playing this game.  Met a 10th Brigade &amp; got a full account of 12th Oct hop over.  It was hellish.  Cut up before our barrage opened.  As it was raining they put on their waterproofs &amp; 'very ' lights reflected on them &amp; put Fritz wise.  The best walking part of battlefield was up to the knees in water. The Hun used the Red Cross for all manner of things &amp; sniped our stretcherbearers down.<br/>Cinema at night Charlie Chaplin in Dough &amp; Dynamite.  Not too well tonight, stomach trouble.</p>

<p>Wednesday 24th<br/>Barney Oldfield of Bradford is some nut &amp; his quaint sayings often tickle us in tent before turning in for the night.
