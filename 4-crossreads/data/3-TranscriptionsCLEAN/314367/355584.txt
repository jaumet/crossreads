  
 I lunched & went to the beach & to Anthony's & did my own - 2 white suits - 2 white shoes 4/6 per pair leather soled - cheap & good when well whitened - Helmet - Several other small things & then I had finished - I dined & to my room & reread in the SMH the tale of the Sydney & Emden - you should get Rawdon to read that aloud - I know the Sydney & some of the officers. We had a naval dinner on the Upolu at Rabaul - The Emden put up a good scrap but a hopeless one against a superior class of vessel - It's curious that no other ship came up & chipped in for they were all on the same job of convoy - Australian troops in Egypt - not quite good enough yet for Europe - The spring will see them fit - My idea of England as the cause - indirectly - of war shows up even here - you can't get even the best men in Australia ready for European warfare under months & months of training & during that time the strain on our few veteran troops must be enormous - The Encounter is off Garden Island - Destroyers &  Una gone out & we follow - Rabaul is I think our place - We've no war news here on Garden Island - Well now dear I think things are pretty right for you at G.I. - I hope your cheque has come.
