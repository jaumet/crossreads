<p>the Drains because Fritz was all over the Camp &amp; we expected a few Bombs to drop, but Fritz was not on a Bomb Dropping Expedition so there fore no harm came to us. This Aerial Display was the best we had witnessed up to date, &amp; we all enjoyed the fun. There is no mistake Fritz has beautiful machines, they appeared to us to be like Large Dragon Flies bearing down on their prey. &amp; as their colour was of a silver Grey they glittered beautiful in the Sun, we could distinctly see the Black Cross on the planes. Eventually all the other Balloons were hauled down, Fritz had 7 Machines taking part in the Display. After the Excitement abated I went out for a stroll until Bed time &amp; then turned in.<br/>Sunday 8th/7/17-<br/>After Dinner my chum &amp; myself decided to take a stroll into Poperinghe, so we dressed &amp; as the weather was unsettled &amp; rain had fallen making the Roads in a terrible condition as the Traffic at all times</p>
