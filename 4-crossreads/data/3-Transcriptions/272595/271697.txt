<p>enjoyable days of my life in her company we all went bathing for a start &amp; had a rattling good time teaching the girls to swim &amp; shoot the breakers which on this beach are pretty good, it was a lovely sunny day so after we came out &amp; got dressed we all laid about in the sand &amp; the girls all let their hair down so as it could dry, this was how I came to notice my girls lovely hair I should certainly have thought it was false otherwise, her name was May Devereaux, after we had our dinner we all went for a stroll &amp; during this I took a few snaps with my camera to help keep alive &amp; fresh a happy &amp; clean day, we strolled about till 9.30 which time found Miss Devereaux &amp; I down on the "Pebbly Beach" this is a most remarkable place all the pebbles are sorted out &amp; laid in nice rows</p>
