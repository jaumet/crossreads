<p>This happened between 5 and 6 P.M. My first time at the Battery firing line today, Our wagon line is about 1 &frac12; miles away things very quiet<br/>8/7/1915<br/>Still fine rather hot, no shells flying about, plenty of flies, The whole of the infantry are being relieved, the artillery, just our luck is staying here 6.30 A.M. First shell over, The unfortunate R.N.D. is suffering again, high explosives in amongst them. Saw a hole made by a Turkish shell supposed to be 16 in. 10 feet across, and 5 ft 6in deep, They believe it come from Chanak. Went to ordnance for a Naval 3lb gun, not ready, it is going to be attached to the 2nd Battery, what for I don't know<br/>9/7/1915<br/>Nothing much doing, another 5,000 troops landing, the 29 Division leaving on 13th Horses suffering from the effects of ticks, a large number here. A few shots in the R.M.L.I and K.O.S.B. lines a few men wounded Some heavy shooting in the firing line. In the Naval Division, 19 men wounded and three killed, by one time shrapnel, the only one out of about a dozen that done any damage</p>
