Dear Mrs Fry
I am very sorry indeed to have to tell you of the death of your son 1340 L. Cpl Fry 13 Bat. Australian Imperial Forces who died here this morning from the result of Abdominal wounds.
He was brought in here very badly wounded and in a very collapsed condition but though the Surgeon and sisters did all they possibly could for him he never improved and died at 6.45 a.m. this morning.He will be buried in the Village Cemetry of Warloy by the chaplin
With deepest sympathy
