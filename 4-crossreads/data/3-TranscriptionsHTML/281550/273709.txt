<p><u>November</u></p>
<p>Germans did not have any objection so I took the next day off as well, I think that they weer too depressed with the last few days war report to worry at what we did.</p>
<p>On Thursday the 7th of November the first signs of revolution in Germany had sprung up. The Marines at the Kiel-canal revolted and are causing a lot of trouble,</p>
<p>There has been some street fighting. The trouble was caused through forcing the marines to go to France to fight in the trenches. To-day the 8th the trouble has spread considerably,</p>
<p>In Hamburg the soldiers are fighting against themselves, the marines are fighting against the Police and soldiers,</p>
<p>Looting and robberies are being carried out in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Whole companies and Battallions</p>
