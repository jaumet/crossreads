 Friday 18 January Weather dull. A walk to Neuve Eglise &amp; look over the ruins.  The place has been much knocked about since June '16 but is not shelled much now, since Messines Ridge is in British hands. 
 Saturday 19 January This morning a balloon at Neuve Eglise broke away from its moorings &amp; floated away over the Bosche lines.  The observors came out in parachutes, &amp; our anti aircraft guns tried by very rotten shooting to destroy the sausage in vain. Weather cloudy.  Heavy bombardment on the right.
