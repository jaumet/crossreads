  
 cap of a shell, any how it is hard to say what was the real cause only it was a very regrettable incident & very sad, & I trust that it will not be my lot to witness such a scene.   As there were not much to do I finished at 4 Pm. 
 Friday 11/1/18 & Saturday 12/1/18 was also quiet, with the exception that I was relieved at 2 Pm (14 oclock) at the same time the Paymaster arrived & paid all hands.  I walked back to camp & cleaned myself & dressed & had some Tea when another chum & myself caught a Troop Train & went into Poperinghe & later on to St Omer for 2 days leave.  As it was my long shift off I intended to have another good time away.   On arriving in Town at 5 Pm Saturday we both went along to the Tivoli Theatre & reserved a seat & at 5-30 we both went in & got a comfortable seat & at 6 pm the Variety show started to a packed house.   It was a very poor show & badly managed & after a while the boys started to go out.  Anyhow as we both had plenty of time we stayed till the finish, the Singing & Acting was very poor & not worth mentioning.     It was over at 8 Pm & we just managed to get a drink in an Estaminet nearby & then we both went along to the Y.M.C.A. opposite the station to put in time until the Train left after Midnight
