I have seen strawberries too but even they are 7d per lb. On Saturday I met Billy Ali in Salisbury.  We had afternoon Tea together & had a bit of a sing song at a Friends House then Billy went to the Pictures while I went to my other Friend's House.  You might think that this was not quite the nicest thing to do, but it was a mutual wish that we should separate.  I am going to run over on the Bike to see Him Some afternoon.  Young Milton Townend was over to see us on Sunday.  We did get a shock.  He is with the A.M.C.
