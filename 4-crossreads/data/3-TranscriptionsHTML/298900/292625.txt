<p>Saturday 2nd Feb 18<br/>   Frost disappeared today the sun coming out &amp; making everything mucky through the thaw.   In the afternoon took a car to collect drugs at Outtersteene but took patients to Dranoutre, [indecipherable] &amp; the C.C.S. at Nieffe on my way.   Had trouble with punctures but managed to get a new tire, our final mishap being a skid into a ditch through trying to pass a lorry on a greasy road.    Luckily we did not capsize &amp; another lorry pulled us out without difficulty.   Collected my stores, a big load, chiefly dressings &amp; returned to our station, Young street M.D.S. about 6 P.M.    Did some writing at night.</p>
<p>Sunday 3rd Feb<br/>   Had a busy day sending out dressings &amp; supplies to the different posts etc.    Weather beautiful.   Practically no wounded coming through but a few sick.</p>
<p>Monday 4th Feb<br/>   Nothing of moment.   Weather good.   Have now got the station in pretty good order looking well &amp; fit for anything.   Had a bath at night before a fire.   Tackled French again.</p>
