January, 1915Sunday 17I shall not become too soft I have my [indecipherable] Uniform C/- under my bed, to sleep on, but all hands are getting very fat. A detonator, dynamite, & fuse were found in the Chart room ere we sailed, some kind German friend no doubt.Vaccinated for Small Pox today & Church parade. "Skippers" I find are very human - We passed the "Port Macquarie" because one could not keep her place, & ever since then her Skipper has been trying to pass us again, our Engineers enjoy the sport & will not give way We are supposed to keep 800 yards apart, one boat behind the other & 3 columns abreast.
