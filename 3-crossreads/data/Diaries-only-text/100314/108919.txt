and then walked up to the O.P. about 400" up the trench. It was a fine sunny morning and the enemy was plastering hard into the rear positions round the Ploegsteert Wood. The batteries were firing hard and the shells were humming over with splendid regularity. Walked over to see Mackinnon whose men are in breastworks on the edge of the Wood and having a quiet and easy time. On the edge of the Wood is an old camouflage tree one time used as an O.P. Went to bed after lunch but did not sleep much and about 4 o'c the General came in to say that G.H.Q. expected an attack on us tomorrow morning. Left with McCartin, Smith and Sergt Tripp for the front line at about 9 p.m.
