These were lower and the gunners had evidently taken a wider sweep. We heard one strike the mud a little to one side.  Another seemed to pass my legs, another over my back. The fourth seemed about a foot from my right ear. It seemed to say "Buzz! or "Biz". The man next to me went in. As soon as I heard the pop pop of the next burst in the distance I jumped into the trench. "Hullo Fritz got you bluffed too" "Yes said I laughing" when the last one buzzed in my earhole & said "Biz" I got the wind up & didn't fancy that kind of Blighty". I could stick it till then. When out resting the second Bdge used to camp at Berr Barracks Locre. So often were we there that we knew every foot of the shops houses and people in it. How well do I remember the little old fashioned chapel on the rise in the centre and the "egg and chips joint" & and the little estaminet (i.e. restaurant) near it, where the "diggers" used to go in the evenings after parade for a feed of "oefs" and "Pomme le terre" for which the Belgian girls charged three francs!
