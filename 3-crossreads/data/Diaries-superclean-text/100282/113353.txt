Jack Hayes I have been discussing what we are going to do where we are going to go, when we go on "leave" to Paris, we have quite a lot of plans but I'm afraid they won't all be carried out.
Received a few more details tonight also supplied a guard for Hqrs.
21st The Coy was on parade this morning but it was mainly physical jerks football, in the afternoon there was a match between B C Coys. The former won easily.
The troops put up a fine stunt last night, some of them never got home til nearly morning, old Digger was showing well, he came into our joint where we were sleeping poured some beer down Bill Bradleys ear, old Bill jumped up in a terrible rage, I thought he was going to kill "Digger" but nothing came of it, a reprisal raid Digger called it, for some of the stunts the Q.M. Staff have been putting up on him.
