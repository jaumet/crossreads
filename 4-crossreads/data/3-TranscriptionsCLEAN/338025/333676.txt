  
 Wednesday 2nd may 1917 Leg stiff went up to Doctor. No duty for two days have to report to the Doctor on Friday morning. After dusk our guns started a very heavy bombardment, which was kept up all night. I am told that the great push starts tonight. This morning the Boys took most of our "Donks" up the line to the batteries as they were short of horses.
