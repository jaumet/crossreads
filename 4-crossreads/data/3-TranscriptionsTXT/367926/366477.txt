My Dear Aunt,
I have received your very welcome letter you seem to think I am quite a frenchman to be able to speak the language well enough to write it, you would be surprised how little the opportunities are to even speak to a french person, especialy where I am now, if I am not mistaken I think I have only seen at most seven french people, now that is saying a lot in France, also; nearly every one goes they mostly speak English.
