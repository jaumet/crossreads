Thursday 1 November 1917Matron determined I must say "rabbits" first thing on Nov. 1st but fear I forgot.  Feeling much improved.  N. Superintendent is a charming woman, pretty grey hair & more friendly towards these "awful Australians" than some are.Once more my chest and back are examined but as temp. is improving this is the last time & I now am recognized as being on the mend.  T. 100, P. 84 all day.Horror of horrors.  Miss Ralston & her friend Miss Dean come to visit me!  I state what I think of them sending me here in this condition so trust she will tell her dear L.P. as they were both to blame.  Now I read & Cobbie brings me the loveliest roses & buys sweet n. gowns.  Marge Woods & her friend F. Best visit me & former implores me to get to No. 14 A.G.H.  Wisdom says, leave things in better hands than yours?
