inside was a note from the lady donor & an address. He paid 1/6 for this lot – it was only intended for some wounded man in hospital. Several cases of [indecipherable] goods – pyjamas, dressing gowns, hospital slippers & socks, white shirts, rugs, washers & towels were broken up to-day & handed out to able bodied men who fancied them. It was in no way a case of need – just that the goods were handy & the men had recently been paid. Thus, while the people responsible could make good fellows of themselves by giving away the unwanted stuff they could also grow richer by charging small sums for the most useful articles
Incidentally the canteen being short of everything, prices for such things as are yet in stock have been raised about 200 % . We ask where does all this cash go to?. A soldier can buy anything but his discharge – at a price, but he often wonders who makes the profit. Hell will be overcrowded with Military administrators & charity Committees!
Our advice to the women who want to help the soldiers: Dont waste your time & money working to make riches for a lot of rogues – send what you want to send direct to those you know or those someone else knows & will tell you of. Preferably, let your donations be in cash, registered in the post.
