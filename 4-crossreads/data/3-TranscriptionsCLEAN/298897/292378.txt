  
 & horse vehicles all going through a sea of mud.  A large number of German prisoners were employed on the roads mostly a poor lot of men, the worst of them being shown our chaps perhaps to demonstrate how easy they might be overcome.  All night long I could hear the motors going & trains shunting there being no cessation in the traffic.  The weather was bitterly cold & the men with only one blanket had a bad time.  Had breakfast at 8 AM next morning 
 Saturday 21st Oct We left Dernancourt at 11 A.M. wending our way through the everlasting mud & being blocked every few yards by the huge transport on the roads.  Motors were passing in their thousands without exaggeration & we, the new troops marching in the same time the old troops coming out made a tremendous mix up  We passed "Albert" & went on to "Fricourt" now nothing but a name, no buildings now standing.  The railway extends pass here to the trenches.  Our march of 4 miles took us 3 hours to perform owing to the traffic.  Here I had my first view of the German dugouts we had read of.  The entrances went down very steeply to a depth of 20 ft or more into perfect rooms lined & floored with wood.  In many they were lined with green & red cloth picturing framing round the sides & Electric light throughout, absolutely. luxurious.  These dugouts were plentiful many extending into one another, all dry & fitted with beds, shelves, pegs etc.
