 We arriv Malta 21st March . 23rd March we go into Dock and it was found necessari to put 13 new plate on the bottom . April 9th the submarin depot ship Adamant arriv with submarin E 11 , 14 and 15 . The follow day they left for the Dardanell . We came out of dock April 16th . April 18th we go outsid the harbour for a trial run everyth is satisfactori . We leav for Lemno the same even . After a fair good trip we arriv Lemno April 22nd and go alongsid the Adamant . The follow day we were fall in on the upper deck of the Adamant while the Captain of the Adamant read out a recommend from the Admiralti on AE 11 's good work , both for record steam and for escort the second conting from Australia , onli spend a few day in harbour dure the 12 month she had been in commiss . In the 12 month we had steam near 40,000 mile . He finish up by say that we were recommend for 7 day leav at the first opportun . After this we were order to get in one month 's provis and be readi to proceed by 2 p.m. the same day . By this order we had a good idea where we were go ( Dardanell ) . After take in provis we cast off from the Adamant at 2 p.m. , and lay off from the battleship Queen Elizabeth while a wireless offic came off to inspect our wireless to see that it was correct : then we proceed to Tenedo arriv there 6.30 a.m. 23rd April .

We got through - anoth case of " Aust will be there " but did n't get back . We cast off from the Swiftsur at 1.30 and proceed to the entranc of the Dardanell , it be our object to get as far as we could on the surfac , without be seen by the searchlight and befor daylight .
