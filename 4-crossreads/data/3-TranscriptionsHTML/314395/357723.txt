<p>known, the study in expressions was priceless and any man's best cobber would have killed him on the slightest provocation.  Now we are faced with four days idleness, and if someone is not murdered before it expires I'll be surprised.  Your motto of "Grin &amp; bear it" however is always best under adverse circs. &amp; I accept it.</p>
<p>I was very grateful to receive your wire of welcome at Albany, and also received another today just after I had wired you telling of our enforced stay.</p>
<p>While writing this I have received your letter and sincerely hope your proposed holiday eventuates.  Re that affair, I will have a talk to you when I get ashore, and we will come to some arrangement.  I will be on the lookout for you at Albury and will wire you when I am coming through which will probably be Tuesday.  Many thanks for putting Mr. Deane on my track, I will look for him.</p>
<p>Now to face the four longest days of my existance.</p>
<p>With my very best wishes<br/>Your affect. Son<br/>George.</p>
