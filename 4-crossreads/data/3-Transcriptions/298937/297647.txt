<p><strike>Today</strike> Yesterday at 2 p.m. the five of us went to Marseilles.<br/>It is about 6 miles from here (Sant&eacute;) to the centre of the town.<br/>The most remarkable thing about the town is that nearly every other woman is in deep mourning.<br/>Soldiers there are in plenty &amp; among them one sees a great number of decorations.  Some have four or five medals &amp; the majority have the strip of gold braid on the sleeve, denoting a wound received in action.  (? service)</p>
