<p>Dear Ted</p>
<p>Your letter to hand a couple of days ago which you wrote Sept 2nd   &amp;  was pleased to hear from you   &amp;  to find you all fairly well leaving me OK you should have received a couple of letters at least from Egypt from me before you wrote that one the mail they went with arrived as I had an answer from one I wrote home   &amp;  two or three elsewhere I also had one from old Alick he said he had a letter from you   &amp;  you had no complaints   &amp;  enjoyed reading it so I answered it right away so I don't suppose I will   <strike>not</strike>  get another from him for a while as I have not wrote to him much I am sorry but any how he tells me he has a go job</p>
