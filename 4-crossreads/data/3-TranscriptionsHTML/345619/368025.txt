<p>On Active Service 3/3/17<br/>My Dear Ruth<br/>Thank you very much indeed for the box of cigarettes which reached me safely amidst the shot &amp; shell at a time when I had run out of smokes, so you can imagine how thankful I was to get them.</p>
<p>I am still alright &amp; in good health, but have had many narrow escapes at times. Give my love to your Mother &amp; Granma &amp; Mrs Charlie &amp; say I often think of the time I spent at Rooty Hill with you all</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Horace C Lovegrove</p>
<p>[Printed:]<br/>At the request of the Authorities: In thanking your donor, please do not mention your unit.</p>
<p>The smokes sent with this postcard were supplied to the Tobacco Fund by Martins Ltd., 201 Piccadilly, London, W.</p>
