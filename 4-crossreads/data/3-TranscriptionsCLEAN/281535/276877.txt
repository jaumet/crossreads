Marcinelle11/3/19Sweating black faces - an awful existence. Long hours & poor wages are causing intense dissatisfaction and unless demands are granted a revolution is promised after our Army is pulled out. Coming up to surface again discomfort to ears was again felt. Visited the engines - all electric and all made in Charleroi. All black we had a group photograph taken and then a good bath and glass of beer prior to saying au revoir. Spring is here. Today on the trees is the first green blush of buds. Walked up the street this afternoon and had a shave. The present strength of the Brigade is such that amalgamation into one big battalion is now the next pressing consideration. Evening went round to Jack's billet and find him on the mend.
