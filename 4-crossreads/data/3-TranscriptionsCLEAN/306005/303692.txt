Met Jessie as came off on the same boat & landed on the Wharf by the Railway Station & as the Nurses were to go to Abbassia I decided to go too; could not find a carriage to take me to Suez & cut  the two mile out on foot in good time, found the photos hardly ready & arranged for the photographer to meet me at the train with them, got the C.O's watch & drove back to Tewfik at the gallap, called at the Savoy
