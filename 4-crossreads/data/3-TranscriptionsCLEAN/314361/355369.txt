  
 had a look through the village. It has a very interesting old church, we went inside & listened to the organ. Like all churches that I have seen in France, it has plenty of color about the inside & full of statuettes. In France coffee seems to take the place of tea, tea you cannot get, except at Millitary canteens & such but coffee is sold every where, they have these estaminets, (coffee houses) every where, you can get in these places, wine, a light sort of beer, & coffee. There is an estaminet, next to our billet, we are often in it, last night I was surprised at the way some boys, from ten to thirteen years could drink beer, it seems quite natural to them. The children in this part of France are a queer lot, they are an unpleasant lot, & continually pulling us for pennies Later 10.45 P.m. Today I received a parcel from home, in it was a pair of sox from Trix. This afternoon I rode in to Armentiers, it is the best city that I have been in, in France, the streets are not quite so narrow & poor looking. There is an impressive solemness about the streets
