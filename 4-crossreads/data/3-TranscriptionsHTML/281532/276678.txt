<p>1/9/18 Mt St Quentin &ndash; Peronne</p>
<p>Chance shells into our bank wounded King and A.N. Smith &amp; 12 of "Ours". 8 Vickers gunners also wounded. Outside later I met two German officers one of whom spoke very good English. He was Lieutenant of a company stationed in Peronne and he had been in England in 1912 &ndash; a very decent jovial chap with glasses. He said our chaps surrounded them this morning and mopped him up. Their orders were to hold the place at all costs. He thought this was to be their winter line, knew nothing of doings except on his own front and had been opposite us at Herieville just two weeks ago. He said people in Germany were quite confident until our recent pushes when they felt that they could no longer hope to win. Conferred with the other C.O's and Brazenor decided</p>
