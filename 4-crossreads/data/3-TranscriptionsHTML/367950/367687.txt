<p>bearing of 252 &deg; from here. Wilson and I heliographed to them this morning. The telephone is installed now from Brigade to us and to the various regiments of the Brigade. Plenty of low scrubby bushes on these sand dunes now and &ndash; clean sand &ndash; more sand &ndash; and still more sand &ndash; Sand in the tea, soup, in the mouth in the clothes, blankets, boots, socks and in fact everywhere it is possible for sand to get. We chew sand at each meal and when I was at the school of Signalling I went to a dentist in Cairo and it cost me &pound; 2/10 to get my teeth repaired in consequence of so much sand-<br/>I suppose I shall be busy here surveying the whole outpost line the Brigadier and all Commanding Officers were out this morning viewing the positions for outposts to be placed. A Bedouin arab was brought into camp this morning by some of our patrols but I believe he is one of our intelligence branch of which we have quite a number who get periodically "Captured".</p>
