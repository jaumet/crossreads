<p>Monday 12 November 1917<br/>Now 15 days off duty but tomorrow I go on in office.<br/>Sewed all morning &ndash; 2 p.m. went to Cairo with S. Watson, did quantity of shopping &amp; visited Headquarters &amp; paid in &pound;10-0-0 instead of banking it, then drew Pt. 6000 leaving balance.<br/>5 p.m. tea at Groppi's, 3 p.m. took a garry to Ordinance stores &amp; drove over the beautiful Kasurel nil [Kasr El nil] bridge &amp; saw the old Nile rolling along &amp; gardens green &amp; lovely.  Took a snap of the bridge.<br/>Very tired &amp; so lonely, this latter feeling is the worst part of my life just now.  Sitting at table with V.A.D's who talk shop &amp; no friend to exchange a few gay words with.  Never mind, things will change some day I know &amp; meanwhile <u>patience</u>.</p>
