the sand becomes intense as the sun gets high in the sky. Far overhead the eternally wheeling kites (a species of hawk) the scavengers of the desert chirrup overhead.
Sunday 31st Jan. 1915
I have just returned from church parade. Altho I put down in my attestation papers no religion I am classed on my identification tag which we all wear round our necks as Presbyterian. I tried the C.E. crowd but find the best sleep is with the Pbty's. Church is compulsory here. 
A few nights ago I spent a night in the native villages. These are most interesting. The watchman ?Safir? with his old snider polished up like silver his [indecipherable] of blank cartridge showed us thro the village in each case. 
We got into their houses for boiled eggs coffee a rare privilege with these arabs especially at 2 3 in the morning. Our entrance into these places received with wild barkings from the hundreds of pariah dogs who run to fro on the flat thatched roofs. They look so funny peeping over the eaves yelping. There are no chimneys the smoke escapes thro the thatch after filling the room with acrid smoke. 
Today is hot clear we have not much to do. Ive applied for a pass to go again to the pyramids. There is no Sunday here
