<p>Those Huns have such d-d artful means<br/>of blowing you to smithereens<br/>With floating mines or submarines,<br/>There's an explosion &ndash;<br/>The vessel shudders, then careens<br/>And sinks in the ocean.</p>
<p>And there you are at dead of night<br/>With neither land nor ship in sight<br/>In water twenty Fahrenheit!<br/>However strong<br/>One soon becomes a stalactite<br/>And can't swim long.<br/>It's just a shilling to a pound<br/>If you're torpedoed you're not drowned.<br/>If not &ndash; there may be sharks around,<br/>You know what for?<br/>Of course your body may be found<br/>If washed ashore.</p>
