December 1915Thursday 2Rather sharp morning but warm after about 10 oclock. One of our 8th Bn. Shot himself in the foot but whether by accident or design has not yet been decided. The Turks bombarded the Lonesome Pine position nearly all day last Tuesday and caused over 200 casualties on our side besides damaging the trenches.
Friday 3Dull but Warm. Our artillery got very effectively on to some Turks in a Trench on our right front. The 18 pounders did considerable execution. I made a banjo out of telephone wire a few tin meat keys, pieces of deal and an old tin.
