In the evening I attended a Pierrot show which was most enjoyable,  all the artists were professional,  it was a treat to hear some music.
29th October 17.    30th October 17.Winter has started again in earnest, cold & bleak,  a great country I don't think. In the evening I attended Church,  the following day another 18 letters arrived,  the answering job was a contract but I eventually got it done,  over 30 letters to answer, surely you sympathise with me. Visited a small town in the afternoon to see Stan. Hedger,  spent the afternoon with him & a good old yarn we had too. He looks the picture of health,  he told me that I looked likewise. In the evening a small party of bearers attended the show & spent a very pleasant evening. I was surprised to see Bub Brown in our Rest Camp,  he certainly looks as if he wants a rest. On returning to our billet I was informed that I was attached to the Orderly Room, a fine job, it will do me.
31st October 17.Dinner given to the bearers, very enjoyable believe me.  In the evening the Night Birds gave a concert which was well appreciated. My worthy cobber's voice was in good trim as usual. The O.C. made a pleasant speech to the bearers. You will not find many Units who have pleasant times like these.Les Hall & Broadbent (Arthur Broadbent's cousin) called to see me today, I am continually meeting fellows from Mosman I know, the world is a small place after all. The former has just returned from Blighty, his second leave. Our second leave should start very shortly. I have now to report that the job of answering 30 letters is completed. Five times I attended that Pierrot show during the week,  it helps to break the monotony.  I forgot to mention that I noticed Bob Bull's grave whilst attending the funeral the other day. He was an old school chum of mine. Mr Cousins knows him well. (you might tell him please.)
