  
 Whilst here the usual camp routine was carried out a number of men being evacuated owing to the malaria contracted in the Jordan Valley. On Aug 25th the Regt left Solomon's Pools marching to the Auja bridgehead where they relieved one Regt of the 12th Cavalry Bgde (Stafford Yeomanry). Night observation Posts were established & Patrols sent out daily to watch any enemy movement. 
 It was reported that a continuous wire fence had been erected in  front of the enemy defences. A Patrol was sent out to verify this, and although they had great trouble in avoiding the enemy trenches & met with a pretty warm reception they gained the object viz [namely] that a continuous wire fence existed from the Jordan to F.3 also between F.5. & F.6. It would appear that there is a gap roughly between F.4 & F.5. through which the patrol advanced. This gap was held by strongly manned trenches. The Patrol crossed several empty trenches but the firing came from behind these. Apparently the intention of the enemy was to cut off our patrol from the opening in barb wire. On the Patrol withdrawing they were shelled by an enemy 77mm gun & reported back to camp with 1 man & 1 horse slightly wounded.
