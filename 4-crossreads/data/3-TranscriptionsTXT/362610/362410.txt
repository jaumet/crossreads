 Thursday 13 July 1916 Heavy shower about 7 o'clock in the morning &amp; once or twice during the day we had light drizzles, but not enough to check the march. Nothing much doing in the morning, &amp; after a very early lunch had to get all gear ready for a move at 12, subsequently altered to 1.30. Moved in a general SE direction over undulating country which gave beautiful peeps of landscape, through the usual fields &amp; villages. Cuttings showed that the surface formation was chalk, &amp; this on the roads, worked up into a fine dust, made marching somewhat unpleasant. Altogether it was a stiff march &amp; I felt about done at the end. The men stood it well but a number of them knocked up, &amp; for the first time during this series of marches, men fell out from "A"Coy. Reached Allonville about 6 o'clock to find it about full of troops belonging to our brigade, &amp; soon settled down in our billets, this time ours being in a small room belonging to the village blacksmith : the boys were in barns &amp; sheds &amp; were comfortable. There are not very many shops in the place &amp; what there are were besieged by men vainly trying to purchase goods, the small stocks carried being very rapidly depleted. Glad to turn into my sleeping-bag early &amp; slept well.
