I dropped you a short note from Ol's &amp; was under the impression then that it would be the last mail to Australia for 6 weeks.<br/>Our business in Cairo was to get our Black Kit bags out of store in Cairo; this was a good enough omen that we were moving out of the country &amp; rumour had it that our destination was France, &amp; this was strengthened by the fact that we were all issued with the latest gas helmets with the patent air-valve in.  I found Ol without much trouble &amp; needless to say she was greatly surprised to see me.  I had to report during the afternoon, &amp; meanwhile Ol sent Walter a telegram to say I was in from Serapeum &amp; that we would be out after tea.  We went out to Heliopolis &amp; hunted Wal up &amp; the three of us came back to Cairo.  After supper we saw Ol home &amp; then I went back &amp; slept with Walter.  He very</p>
