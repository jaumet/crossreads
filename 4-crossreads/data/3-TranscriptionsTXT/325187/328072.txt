 [Saturday 25 November 1916] 
 Still anchored at  Salonika,  went ashore for an hour, it is a pretty town of many colors filled with a Cosmopolitan crowd of Soldiers &amp; Cut-throats.  A big Roman Wall &amp; Tower show the old City  now surrounded by Tents Stores Haneaks &amp; Soldiers-   Olympus is covered with a Cloud like Table Mountain &amp; mule tracks lead over the mountains- ( Following paragraph is crossed out) Police are everywhere &amp; it is not wise to express your opinions  Many gunboats in the Harbour have their guns trained on the town a Hostile Plane flew over but did not drop any bombs- as usual all lights are out &amp; we are not allowed to even have a Concert in the Saloon
