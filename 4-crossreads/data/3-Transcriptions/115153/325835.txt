<p><u>MY EXPERIENCE IN THE A.I.F</u></p>
<p>I must first of all describe how I came to join the A.I.F. Well I had often thought of "joining up", but the fact that I had two brothers there before me kept me back for a time until I was granted my annual holidays from the City, and came up to the country where I came in contact with a pal of mine, when we both decided to go to the City and enlist.
