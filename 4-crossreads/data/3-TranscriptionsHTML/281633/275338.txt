<p>I don't know how the concert got on because I had to look after the lighting unit.  The Engine was "Tres Malade" &amp; gave me an anxious time.  Ditto every night until the</p>
<p>28.10<br/>Had a look over the Weaving Factory at Flixecourt today.  Seen them making carpets of all kinds, some kinds of Braid &amp; Jute, Canvas, Calico etc. (Saint Freres).  I had a tooth stopped yesterday after two temporary fillings.  The Dentist had about a company waiting for his attentions.  He gave me a rather painful Quarter of an hour.

<p>31.10<br/>The Engine has been getting overhauled and altered ever since I came on it with the result that I have to learn over again the possies for the best mixture, speed control, &amp; Timing.  In addition I struck a new trouble last night.  The Engine flywheel is 3'3" in Dia. &amp; the Dynamo Pulley is 7" in Dia.  The distance between pulley centres is 24'.  At just the right speed for the Engine the Belt develops a lateral swing &amp; plays hell generally.  At any other speed the Engine will stop after about 10 min.</p>
<p>1.11<br/>Visited the Bat. yesterday.  Although they have been out for nearly a month &amp; have received a number of Gassed &amp; wounded men back, their Parade state is only 422 now.  No. 1 Platoon A Coy. draws rations for 12 men.  While at Villers-Brettonaux the full strength of A Coy. on a working Party one night was 14 this number on later nights was gradually increased to 27.  They only went out on alternate nights about this time.</p>
<p>2.11<br/>One can get some surprising results by calling one of the Gordon Highlanders "The Kaisers Bodygaurd".</p>
