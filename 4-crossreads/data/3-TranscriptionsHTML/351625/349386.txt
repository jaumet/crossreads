<p>the difficult task of the boys &amp; bore it all.</p>
<p>I bid your Son adieu, all the time I was in Hospital I was thinking of him, I wrote him several times &amp; before I left I heard from him.</p>
<p>I have been anxious about him since as I heard he was badly wounded (I sincerely hope this is not the case) would you kindly let me know as I would like to meet Bob on his return.  My one ambition when in Hospital was to get back to make some return to those boys especially your Son for whom I thought the job was so strenuous.</p>
<p>Until I have the pleasure of meeting him, would you kindly accept my sincere wishes for his safe return to you, &amp; you may well feel proud of a Son who has not only rendered valuable services to his country, but to a comrade when in distress.</p>
<p>With kind Regards,<br/>I remain, Yours Sincerely<br/>F. Bailey, Pte.<br/>2nd Battalion.</p>
