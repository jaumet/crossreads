  
 No. 2 General Hosp. Mena. 4.4.15. Dearest old Mrs., I was pleased to get your letter dated 18.3.15 - poor old Mrs down in the dumps because you didn't get a letter last mail - well old girl I can assure you I wrote - I haven't yet missed writing to you each week.  I told you in my last letter that I had received the cigar lighter - I have not yet received the Easter egg.   I note that Trix is leaving you on May 13th - I suppose she is beginning to fret about her family poor old Trix; I think she is quite right to return if she is worrying about them.  Capt. Ross is one of our officers what about him?   He is a very self important young gentleman.  He is a son of the lunacy specialist in Sydney.    Of course I read the book each night & find great comfort in reflecting that you are probably reading the same page at about the same time as I do.   I went to service at Mena House Chapel to-day (Easter Day) but it was a very cold comfortless affair.   I have just sent you a cable addressed to Westborne Grove P.O.   "How do very fine best love"   I hope it reaches you all right.
