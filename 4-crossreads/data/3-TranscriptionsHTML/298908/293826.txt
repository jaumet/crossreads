You should hear the crazy noises they produce it's the fun of the world, pipes are all very well when played by an expert at a distance but when a mug gets hold of them at close quarters well the result is better imagined than described, puts me in mind of 20 cats fighting &amp; screaming together with the howls of a dog thrown in for balance.</p>
