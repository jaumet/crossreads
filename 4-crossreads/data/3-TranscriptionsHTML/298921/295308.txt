<p>1915 Wednesday December 15<br/>Some of the men who were putting [indecipherable] brought back 'Chestnuts" &ndash; I missed them in my Dug out &amp; found this morning when I went to put on my sheepskin waistcoat that the mice had hidden the Chestnuts in it but left <u>all the bad ones</u> in another corner of Dugout and yet the bad ones were not broken. How did they know! Today the Turks hung a dummy man over their parapet &amp; it was not until a good many shots were fired that we took a Tumble.</p>
