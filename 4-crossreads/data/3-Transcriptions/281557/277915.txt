<p>Thursday June 29th <br/>billets: showery day: a few planes up in  between the showers: had a general clean up during the day: packed up &amp; relieved by the 16th about 10 pm: marched off &amp; got to these billets about 1.am (Friday) pretty stiff march after our long spell off marching: there seemed to be something doing round St Eloi way by the look of the coloured flares &amp; the gun flashes: these billets are not too bad:</p>
<p>Friday 30th June<br/>billets: fair day: got to sleep about 2 am: the 6th Bgde had a raid &amp; it was on just after we got out of "Erq": I hear it was a success so Fritz is having a rough time taking things all round: parade 9.30 &ndash; 12 noon &amp; 2 - 4.30 pm under Capt. "Fussy": If ever there was a mad hair brained hoodlum it is him: he is a military crank pure &amp; simple: all this parade "muck" is no good for us we don't want to be parade soldiers we want to do our bit of fighting &amp; then get out of their khaki for good: planes very active after tea there were twenty one of ours in one bunch &amp; some new immense ones were up there: the firing line is about six miles from here &amp; shells very seldom get this far: Alf &amp; I had a walk along the road after tea &amp; the country looks well the oats &amp; wheat looks splendid &amp; they will have a splendid crop: a big Aust mail was delivered &amp; I got none: it</p>
