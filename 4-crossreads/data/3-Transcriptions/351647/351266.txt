<p>I haven't seen a piano since the night at Tunbridge Wells.  Mrs. Johnston sent me another parcel of eats the other day, wasn't it great of her, I think shes a brick.  The contents were so welcome.  I get so full of bully beef stew &amp; bread &amp; jam &amp; tea.</p>
<p>Well I must flee.  Do you ever hear of Alison &amp; Duncan now.  I heard Duncan had got a commission.  I haven't heard from Joe Kirby, one chap told me he had gone to an Officers training school.  I hope he gets one too.</p>
<p>So long, love to the Boss &amp; Mac &amp; Graham &amp; yourself.</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Wilk</p>
