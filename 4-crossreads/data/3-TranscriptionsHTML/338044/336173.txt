<p>Wednesday next</p>
<p>26th June:- Monday<br/>To-day is not so hot  A few of us at least have plenty of work (I &amp;  Legge, far too much in comparison)  There seems to be a further delay in departure  - to-day we hear of several drastic changes amongst our headquarters in London re being sent out to rejoin their old units. How pleasant a prospect for us. It will suit me however, so long as I get to England first  Shall be quite satisfied to go to the front then  As a matter of fact, this is what I have sought all along.</p>
<p>To-day at 1 pm 101 &deg; . To-night at 9 pm 91 &deg; &amp; at 10-30 pm 89 &deg;   Much cooler</p>
