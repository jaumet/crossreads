<p>What a marvelous thing wireless telegraphy is  -  Our man tells me he cd  -  hear the German cruisers talking last night  -  They are somewhere in the Pacific but where? There was a buz that a German gunboat had shelled Wilhelm Haven yesty  -  but it's only buz  -  Every German wireless station in the Pacific &amp; Indian Ocean is in our hands  -  Their capture was imperative &amp; the first operation of our war down here  -</p>
<p>We had some press news to-day but both allies &amp; Germans seem to us to be holding their own  -  The crumpling up of the German right is good of course but it only meant that the G.R. was too extended &amp; they went East to join their centre  -  One N.O, has bet a bottle of champagne that Bill throws his hand in by Xmas  -  On the contrary most of us think Bill will raise us two by then  -  Excuse this poker dialect  -  The NO's way of expressing himself leaves much to be desired but you grasp his meaning in its entirety &amp; that's his main point =</p>
<p>Saturday Oct 3<br/>Still nothing doing  -  Had my morning swim at the pier in wonderfully clear water  -  Then breakfast  -  I get up at 6 &amp; have a biscuit &amp; tea &amp; then swim  -  After breakfast I took a stoker over to the Grantala  -  He has been giving a little trouble</p>
