<p>Friday, 4 May 1917</p>
<p>WADI-GUZZI</p>
<p>Cairo was rather upset on a recent morning &ndash; it woke up to find some (Australian of course) soldiers had climbed up the Statue of MOHAMET ALI &amp; put a nosebag on the horse!  This is erected in principal Square of the city.</p>
<p>My horses are doing well on good grazing. [The following sentence crossed through.] S'pose after the war they will fall into the hands of the Remount Depot &amp; get their tails &amp; manes chopped off &ndash; this is the first thing a Tommy does with a horse.</p>
<p>We are camped in a big water worn rugged Donga or WADI about &frac14; wide down which the water has run for many centuries down to the sea.</p>
