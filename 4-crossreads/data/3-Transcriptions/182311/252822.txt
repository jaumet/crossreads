<p>for over ten days, the ice is in places five inches thick and skating is much indulged in by the boys, snow has been lying about all this time and muddy roads and flats have frozen hard, and then the roads are being pounded into fine dust and so blown about and still it freezes, the newspapers say it&#39;s the worst and longest frost that we have had in Europe for very many years, but we are standing it well, very well too, for &#39;tis our second winter and I suppose our blood has thickened and our bodies have become cold resisting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well now I&#39;ll close, I&#39;m still going strong here in France and no regrets and not suffering at all from Nostalgia (I think that&#39;s another word for Homesick) but at the same time the sooner this job is over the better I&#39;ll like it.&nbsp; Don&#39;t worry about the opinion my boys hold for me - I&#39;m their father - their big brother and their pal and just as I on my side look after their interests and help them, so they consider me part of their possessions, why the other night in returning to our own trenches (I always make a point of being last and so seeing if anyone drops and can get him in) I found four secreted in a shell hole watching for me to get in safely, good of them, that.&nbsp; No, every man has his streak of gold, I find it and endeavour to polish it and give it greater value to the whole nugget, it&#39;s the best way - it&#39;s the only correct way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With heartiest wishes to all,</p>
<p>HAROLD.</p>
