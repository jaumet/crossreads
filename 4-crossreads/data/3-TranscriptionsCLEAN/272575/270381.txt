  
 my idea of a healthy job, not much, there are some reinforcements here in this camp.   Glad I'm not in their lot, a lot of the old hands have not got much time for them, - I am expecting word at any time now from you or Mother to Say when Harry is leaving, if he does not leave before Xmas, dont forget to Send along his Regmtl No. No. of Regmt, and what Battn tell him if he gets half a chance to collar any sort of a Staff job to take it.  I believe Eric Elder is on the Pay Staff at Barracks near Perham. - they want clerks, badly some of the men they have are real proper muddlers, guaranteed to tangle a set of books up in a week, and give a competent bookkeeper, a fortnights work untangling them.  - Yesterday the voting for or against conscription.    nearly all the old hands are going strong for  NO .   a few vote yess. but I fancy NO stands a big chance.   for my own Part I favour  No .   I would have voted  yess  at the commencement of the war but not now if the Government has only just waked up.   well its is too late.   Australia has done her share   Hughes may talk of Dishonour, or anything else he wishes.    he is rousing the boys here, and they are against him, but that does not matter.    As the English People think that he is all that a Politician should be and they hold him up as an example to their own.   Politicians.    Such is life   Prophets & Politicians have no honour in their own countries.   I am very much in favor of Hughes & his Policy myself, but he is late trying to bring in Conscription   now I must ring off.  I dont know just what I have written, but I have written, and must, write half a dozen more letters as soon as Possible    Much love to all at home.    some for relations & friends from your Loving Bro     Chas G.P.
