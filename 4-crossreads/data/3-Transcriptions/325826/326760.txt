<p>3.  let me interrupt myself, for since I wrote that word the servant came &amp; handed me a letter that absolutely amazed me &amp; I'll tell you about it.  It was in Leo's writing &amp; was re-addressed here from Alexandria.  When I opened it I found that it was from Ma'adi and dated 11th. January, 11th January if you please &amp; this is 13th April, doesn't it make one mad, and yet it is just like them over here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In it he acknowledged my first note &amp; the socks I posted on arrival &amp; mentioned his whereabouts &amp;c.  Also he gave his new address "Driver" &amp; without Reinforcements &amp;c, so that explains all the difficulty I had in getting letters &amp; telegrams to him when we came to Cairo and tried to find him.  I have looked carefully at it &amp; it was addressed correctly c/o of Rid and posted or stamped on 14th. Jan, so that all the delay has been in the post.  That is a sample of the sublime postal arrangements over here &amp; I have heard of one or two others from acquaintances that are nearly parallel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was going to tell you when I was interrupted so "interestingly" was, that the day before yesterday an English mail came in &amp; one or two people here had letters so that I immediately began to watch hard for one from Rid for that is the mail that would bring their letters from Marseilles.   There was also an unusual Australian mail delivered &amp; there wasn't a thing for me by that either &amp; I knew there was a week before the next English mail &amp; ten days for the Australian so I retired, a saddened , chastened woman, do you think I'll survive it?<br/>Now I want to talk to you again about that cable you sent me and about my future movements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I badly wanted to send you a return one right away but then remembered that I might only have to send another to countermand it if I did anything too hastily &amp; I have hoped as the days have been going by without</p>
