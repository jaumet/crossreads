 8/11/17 Pari of the Sacr Coeur . It was not the best of day for a birdsey view but better than last visit here . The whole citi lie spread below and strang to say it is from this distant place that one receiv the best idea of the grandeur of the Eiffel Tower . This enorm church itself , with it Oriental look , doe not appeal to me much . Inside a servic start , a priest lead recit of the Rosari . Now pass down the long stair that lead from this high hill . Near the bottom sit a dirti long grey hair old man with a cockatoo ? he was there last time and appar doe not move all day . What an exist ! Took tube at Les Abbess back to the Opera and went down to Brentano for a book . Where is there a street to match Avenu de l?Opera ? From Tuileri came by tube back to the hotel . The Pari tube is wonder and today and yesterday has cart me mani mile from one end of Pari to the other .
