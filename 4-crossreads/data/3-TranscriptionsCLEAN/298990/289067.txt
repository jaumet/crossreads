  
 Longueval or Delville Wood 8/11/16 Slept well and warm and got up about 9 am intending to go up to the trenches but Major Mal. Smith dropped in to live at our place and told us that the Battalion has moved to a new place  further forward and that poor old McCormick was blown to bits last night.  Head arm and a leg blown off God rest him.  Very cold all day but mostly fine. Stayed in & wrote letters and read.  Our planes active all the afternoon but much in trouble from the wind flew like wild fire before the wind over the enemy's lines but had to slowly battle back against the wind so slowly that at times they appeared almost stationary and so afforded a good mark for anti - aircraft guns.  There have been about 3 heavy stunts today in the artillery line besides an incessant steady undercurrent of rumbling. Mud remains bad and mules passing are thickly caked with it and their tails appear almost solid.  Gas balloons up late in afternoon when the wind had dropped.  Fierce and continuous bombardments all night and a few shells landed near us.  Taubes active and flew all over us. 
 9/11/16 A good warm sleep.  Great air fights this morning in a bright blue sky.  Many of our Planes and Taubes up and much bombarding by anti-aircraft guns.  Our planes avoid the Taubes and seem to leave them to the guns.  Muddied all or tents.  Poor tired exhausted devils started staggering in all covered with mud and full of tales of hardship from the front line.  Many dead from heavy shellings sustained there and some men fell and lay in the mud too done up to proceed further.  Made tea and dispensed rum to the poor chaps and made arrangements for tentage.  The aircraft of Fritz is looking up and doing good work.  Dead lying round everywhere.
