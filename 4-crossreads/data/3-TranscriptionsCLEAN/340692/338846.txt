  
 you can picture me trying to get on my wet boots in a little hole that it was impossible to stand up in, & every minute of the delay the mud & water rising, covering my only blanket & groundsheet.  I felt at the very depths of discomfort & despair. 
 I got through this night somehow, but there were others to follow that proved equally as hard, when I have laid stiff with the cold, aching with fatigue, & preying for the daylight. 
 We experienced rain, frost, snow, & ice on the shell-hole water an inch thick, & worse than all these, an all conquering condition of mud & slush.
