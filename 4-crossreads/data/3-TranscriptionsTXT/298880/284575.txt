The Perfect Day-When you come to the end of a perfect dayAnd you sit alone with your thoughtsWhile the chimes ring out with a carol gayFor the joy that the day has broughtDo you think what the end of a perfect dayCan mean to a tired heartWhen the sun goes down with a flaming rayAnd the dear friends have to part.
