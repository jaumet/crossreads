 be the onli one who is keep an eye on the men , this made me wild and we had a pretti heat argument I can tell you howev at "knock off " time he was as friend as anyth with me . I had a row over a fatigu parti one night at Ypres with this same joker . Old Fritz sent over 2 big shell today ( 12 inch ) one lob right on the edg of the road just miss a traction engin and a motor lorri , it dug a hole in the ground easili 10 ft deep and 18 across it and as round as a cup she was a love , the other was rather more excit for I ll swear it did not miss our hut by more than a foot it land right in the drain in front of our joint and by good luck it never explod , if it had it would have blown our hut to piec , it just as well
