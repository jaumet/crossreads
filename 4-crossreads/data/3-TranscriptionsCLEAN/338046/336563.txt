1917 Aug 26He had been up to Scotland and had had a very good time with his relations. On 26 August - reinforcements for the 29th and 31st Battalions arrived. They looked a fairly big lot of fellows.An aeroplane was booked to come over to our camp, so that signalling between 'palnes and signallers could be explained. We all went u[p on top of Australia hill and waited for it.When it arrived, it did not land but did a lot of stunting, which at the time, I thought very clever. The pilots sent several messages on his hooter and at length dropped a message with two red, yellow and blue streamers attached. The message was to the effect that the wind was too high to allow him to land.On 1st September Bill Collins, Myall, McKee and myself went to Wilton (see photo p 140 should have been inserted here)
