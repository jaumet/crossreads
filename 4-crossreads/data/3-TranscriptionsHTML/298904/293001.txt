<p>The 9th Army Corps were the ones that suffered, they were on low lying ground &amp; in some places they were flooded out &amp;amp drowned, altogether they lost 200 men counting frozen &amp; drowned cases, that will give you an idea of the severity of the storm.<br/>The Turks we had good reason to believe suffered even worse than we did, for scores of them gave themselves up &amp; they told some terrible tales of course you must take every thing you hear with a grain of salt but they must have suffered terribly for they were not near as well equipped as we were, in fact many of them had no overcoats &amp; waterproofs were almost unknown among them</p>
