<p><strike>In Cairo again, with usual result.</strike></p>
<p>Wednesday 12th Jan 1916</p>
<p>Volunteers called for Special Guard &amp; decided to go.</p>
<p>Arrived at Fraz (15 of us in all Sgt &amp; 2 Cpls) about three miles out of Cairo at about 2 pm  Huge railway siding containing immense coal stacks &amp; oil stores.</p>
<p>Am not feeling too well, but appreciate the chance of getting away from Gizeh.  Difficulties with rations owing to their not having been forwarded.  Men hungry &amp; cold.  Also blankets have failed to turn up.  Corporal of night picket on oil shed.  Very cold, but Soudanese watchmen, quaint fellows, help us with a big coal fire which we sit round</p>
