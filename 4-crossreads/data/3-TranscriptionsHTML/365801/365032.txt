<p>[Type-written letter from Gen. William Birdwood to Lieut. Col. John Lamrock]<br/>1st Army Corps, France<br/>4th June 1916.</p>
<p>My Dear Lamrock,<br/>I am so glad to have the opportunity of writing to congratulate you on the C.B., [Companion of the Bath] which you have been awarded for your good work in command of the [20th] battalion at Anzac.<br/>I have been so sorry not to see you recently, since the bad time your battalion had in the trenches.  I came round them as you know the following morning, but missed you then, and again missed you the next time I was round.  I trust, however, I shall have the opportunity of seeing you before you leave us, as I should like to be able to say goodbye to you.  [hand written note added]  I hope you will come &amp; see me if you can.</p>
<p>I well know how disagreeable it will be to you to leave us, but I am sure you will not misunderstand the reasons.  The more I see of this war, the more is it impressed upon us how essential it is to have quite young men in command of battalions, and with the very best will<br/>and /</p>
