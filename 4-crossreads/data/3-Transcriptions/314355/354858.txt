<p>June 21<br/>224.<br/>In the afternoon saw Scott &ndash; the Divisional Artist (he's from the 50th Battn.) with his easel set by the General's hut, and sketching in the huts of H.Q.  Though at first I decided against going across, in the end I walked over, and spent a good yarning with him, his sketch was roughly outlined, and a groundwork of green massed worked in.  I think his rough work is full of richness, and his detail is good though his style appears almost impressionistic &ndash; after Brangwin.  I mentioned the pool in a full sun day, and its bathers:  he is waiting for the day.</p>
<p>Ken to St. Omer so a walking alone to the Marie Cappel farmhouse for supper, full of Tommies:  but I was hungry.  Waiting one confidentially leaned over towards me, "Ohoi Chooum, do 'e billong to 'ochi' company?"  I denied it, denied "B" and "C" Companies, out of his pocket came an old letter, slowly he read through it, then carefully folded it so that only an address remained, and he handed it across.  On it was a name and number &ndash; a Wilson of the 30th Bttn., "My sister met him two years ago, and' I'm lookin' fohr heim!"</p>
<p>Later they were arguing:  but they were all arguing on the one side, and each definitely stated our warr hopes, one turned and asked if I thought it would be over this year, and I was outside the pale, one moon-faced youth held awhile his eating of chips and eggs, and pausing reflectively combed with his fork a pale golden moustache.</p>
<p>I went out furious at Tom's map mania and came back smiling.</p>
<p>Heard Loughlin tell the General that Cutlark was here:  so will look out for his accountings from Patrol reports.</p>
<p>No mail.  Eleven days now since writing to Davis &amp; Oriole and 8 to the T.B.C. and Smiths at Paris.</p>
<p>June 22<br/>225.<br/>Home mail.<br/>From Mother:  April 7, and enclosed from Geoff of April 4, and a letter from Betty enclosing five snapshots, of Mother,</p>
