 Not feeling too bright after the "cratur" last night. Didn't get up till dinner time as I had a thick head. At lunch time we got a free issue of beer given us by the Major. 
 I rested all the afternoon & had a game of cards after tea. I got to bed at about 10 o'clock & slept like a top. I have a bit of a cold just now but otherwise I am very fit. 
 It is very hard to get winter clothes. I only have a shirt & my jacket & it is very cold if you are out at night as I often am.
