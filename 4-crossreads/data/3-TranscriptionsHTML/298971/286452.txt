<p>From our post tonight we carried about 17 cases in a few hours, distance 1&frac12; miles.  We are all exhausted.  Infantry with us say it's the hardest work ever they were asked to do.  Two of us found cover in a hole with a stretcher across the top for shelter.  We sat in here all night without any sleep.</p>

<p>At midday moved out to Goose Alley again.  Nearly blown up on the way.  Shells landed all round us when near Flers.  Rush of cases during.</p>
