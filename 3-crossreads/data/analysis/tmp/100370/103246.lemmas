 " as we pass , beneath our feet , we felt the timber crack" . About 12 or 15 feet of the pontoon broke away . Then the forc of the current carri the poor struggl team underneath the bridg . It was most piti to see the desper struggl for life they made . The one I was ride , a big hors just on 17 hand high , must , I think , have broken his leg , for poor old " Babi " as he was call was onli seen onc . My other leader " Ludd " made the gamest struggl I have ever seen . He was too far down the stream to be abl to reach him to cut his har , and twice I thought he was give up the struggl . I must confess I felt a big lump rise in my throat as I watch him . He stretch his head out along the water and lay still , sink gradual . Then a mule rose alongsid of him , and got clear of it har , and perhap encourag a littl , poor Ludd made anoth desper effort , and struck clear of his har . In a few moment will hand had hold of him at the bank , and thorough exhaust he was haul ashor . The mule too made an exceed game fight . Out of the team of six , one mule and one hors was lost . I am as free from possess now as it is possibl to be . Cloth , blanket , ration , all lie at the bottom of the Jordan . Fortun , a short time ago , I got an old gas mask haversack , and decid to carri my diari in it and alway on me , so I have save that , but all my photo near two year collect are gone , togeth with curio . Howev , we were all extrem thank to escap with our live . Fortun , the mule decid to go over on the off side , which gave us a chanc . If they had come over on the near , we would undoubt have been into the river , and under the struggl hors at that . This morn twelv enemi plane came over again , and bomb us , but did no damag . But they are tri to the nerv , even though they do miss with their bomb , becaus one never know when they will score a hit , and there is alway a sport chang [chanc ] of the score be veri much against you .
