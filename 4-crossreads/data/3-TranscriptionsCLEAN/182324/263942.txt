of the "brutes" that rode at such a fearful pace. I often wonder what some of those old people would think if they could be suddenly brought back to, say, George St at 5.30pm.

Well I suppose there is no help for it but to "Carry on" & do our best
I leave here on Sunday morn so will be in Sydney on Tuesday but I cannot see my way clear to make an appointment until I arrive as I do not know how long we shall be there before we go to Melbourne but I will certainly do my best even if its only to see you to shake hands with you & we will look to a better opportunity in the near future of cementing our acquaintance better & now again thanking you for the copy of the "Yandoo" with kindest regards
I remainYours SincerelyRH Wynne
