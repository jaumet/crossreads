 Fricourt, Mametz, Wood  21/12/16 past Bernafaye and Trones Wood until we found ourselves right among Tommies only and commenced to strike French dumps and noticeboards so we concluded we had come too far and turned back. Struck a "Town Major" in a German dugout many feet below ground a decent English chap who directed us aright. The back round Bernafaye Corner past a big A.M.C in an old system of trenches and saw many chaps being carried to ambulances with feet swathed in bandages. Turned in on to some duckboards and found the 21st in huts and reconnoitred there. The ground around pitted very much with shell holes but Dame Nature is putting her green mantle over all to cover the scars. Returned the same way and reached camp after dark. A few big shells went hurtling over and burst with loud crash. Odds and ends to fix up during the evening. Dr. roused out to nosebleed &amp; crook in guts!!!
