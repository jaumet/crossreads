  
 6.7.15 Tue. 6th.  When going for a swim last night we reached the beach in time to see the 16th Btn. of Infantry on their way to Lemnos for a spell;  the Turks gave them a send off with a hail of shrapnel as far as their guns would carry, do not know if they suffered any casualties or not, the shooting seemed bad.  A new 6 inch Howitzer was also on the beach.  These hills are now covered with guns & most of them have not fired a shot so far.  Signalling practise again to-day, a good deal of artillery firing has been going on this afternoon.  I inquired this afternoon if there was a parcel for me but was told there was none with this mail, so perhaps I shall not get the writing material after all.  The Turks dropped some large shells on Steels Post about 6 oclock this afternoon which did considerable damage.  Smithers, Penny & I went for a dip again this evening.
