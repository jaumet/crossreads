<p>Dad always talked of Sulby Glen Marie  &amp;  I rode to the bottom on Sulby side   &amp;  rode  &amp; walked  right to the top of Snaefell. It was a glorious day   &amp;  we had a lovely time although it was rather severe on Marie who is only a girl after all. The view was lovely &amp; thought of riding to Ramsey  &amp; back that way but we tossed for it as it was late   &amp; we came back Sulby Way. Dad will perhaps remember Tholt-e-Will on the way down. The Glen Waterfall half way house was closed so we had to wend our way round the high road  &amp; it was pretty rough through being so little used since the war started. We had Tea in the Village on the way Home  &amp;  were very tired when we arrived home.</p>
