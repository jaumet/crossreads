<p>Had dinner straight away and hurried to underground and soon got to Alhambra show. Only fair Elsie Janis best but not wonderful and some stories at the end. Dot has a very forced and annoying laugh. Back by underground and decided to act the same next day. Back to Imperial and got room alright and bed about 1 after taking Dot home. Day cloudy and some showers.</p>

Cloudy all day and some showers in evening</p>
