  
 they of course carry no lights. The submarines have been very active here lately sinking 8 & damaging one vessel in one week they were of course only small vessels but they were mostly [indecipherable]vessels carrying firewood etc. Could they repeat this performance often we would feel the pince as all water, firewood, food etc has to be brought to us. Other vessels sunk lately included one with a large mail , the "Silver Ash" I believe & one which had New Zealand A.M.C. & a few nurses aboard but the real truth of these matters we seldom get. Song service at night in which I joined heartily  & afterwards listened to a first class address. Monday 1st November A very easy day & just as well as I had a bilious attack. It is always the same when I shift camp, either the excitement (if any) or the new water or a little of both brings on a little constipation. Walked to a village in the afternoon & bought some figs & leeks, these or spring onions I enjoy very much & never miss a chance of getting some . Received an issue of one pair of drawers & a cardigan jacket, very acceptable this cold weather.
