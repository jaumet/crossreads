<p>Thursday 15th Aug.<br/>Before turning in I had a sponge down &amp; soaked my dirty clothes. Spent a fairly good night being disturbed a few times by the bombs &amp; guns. Washed out my clothing which I had soaked over night &amp; in general put things straight. He shelled the village heavily during the morning &amp; it was decidedly a very unhealthy spot, we being very close up and under observation as a Canadian was using the attic as an observation post. After dinner we received orders to pack up &amp; move immediately. Apparently the stunt was off or not necessary, so we rapidly packed the stuff &amp; by means of the cars shifted it back to our camp near Caix. Had a narrow escape with our cars during the day, one caught fire but it was got under before being damaged. We were all back at Caix before six o'clock &amp; had orders to move out at 10 P.M. Just on dusk we were ordered into the trenches &amp; for two hours were very pleased to stop there as he was bombing heavily &amp; sending shrapnel over, big stuff which [indecipherable] at our wide trench cover. At 10.30 P.M. the order was given to turn in &amp; as the worst of the bombing</p>
