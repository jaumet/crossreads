the Camp is seething with discontent & only wants a little match to start the mob going, they can't do what they like with the Australians, all the men swear they are not going to go on parade & I only hope they stick to it.  Had a very small Dental List last night & I soon finished, then Lindsay & I went for a walk down to Sutton Veney, it is lovely over here of an evening strolling down the leafy & flower strewn roads & lanes.  Our usual medical inspection & classification was held today, I went up before old Von Hagen as one of the examing Drs here is commonly called he marked me the same as before B.I.A.2 he gave me a haul over with his instruments  I am getting much stronger now & am beginning to feel very fit, only I am very weak & sweat freely.
