  
 [Card] From Lance Corporal T. Taylor Australian Expeditionary Forces, On Active Service Abroad, To My Dear Mother With Best Love 
 For the sake of those I dearly love, And in the cause of Liberty, I've left my southern sunny home, And crossed the wide and trackless sea. 
 Heaven guard and bless you, dearest one, Whilst I in foreign hands may roam; Though I am absent in the flesh, My tenderest thoughts are of my home. 
 Good luck to you whilst I'm away; I know the parting cost you pain; My earnest prayer from day to day is God be with you till we meet again.
