<p>Sunday 25th<br/>The extent of the advance towards Cambrai so far is that the Hindenburg line has been breached and our troops have advanced to a depth of 6 miles on a 12 mile front. About 200 tanks went over without any artillery preparation and the infantry &amp; Cavalry poured in through the breach The Germans were completely taken by surprise We have taken about 10,000 prisoners &amp; 100 guns &amp; the fighting continues, very desperately I had a service this morning with the 2nd Battalion It was bitterly cold &amp; not at all pleasant A keen strong wind is blowing</p>
