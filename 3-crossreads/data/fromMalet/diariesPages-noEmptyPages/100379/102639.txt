14th January 1917. Got up at 7 had breakfast. Reported at 8 o'clock for ration fatigues on the HQrs stores. A hard job. Unloaded 7 lorries of oats 5 of hay and loaded up all the Divisional G S wagons. This was solid going from 1 till 6 tonight. Somewhat tired on it. Walked back to billets went to bed.
15th January 1917. Early morning stables. Shifted our billets lines to Strazelle. We are now billeted in an old mill, and a very rough concern after the billets we have had in the 25th. We hope to move up to the line tomorrow. I am wishing this comes to pass. Ha d a feed at Mlle Madeline's had a few drinks. Went to bed in our new "doss".
16th January 1917. Early morning stables. Spent a cold night in our new billets. Didn't move up to the line. Fooled about the lines all day. Issued with our rations today. Went down to the village for a bath. We leave for the line tomorrow sometime. At last our turn has come. I am rather glad it has. Hope I sleep warmer tonight.
