<p>Monday 7 [6] May 1917 [1918]<br/>Yesterday I got a peep of the blue Mediterranean &amp; lovely it was to see the sea again.  Matron arrives 9 a.m.  "Regular" sits on bed, asks age, father's name, etc., pats me &amp; departs.<br/>10.30 a.m. M.O. businesslike.  Well sister what have you been doing with yourself?  Examines abd., tongue, feels pulse, orders mist (mag. sulph. I find afterwards to my horror) &amp; departs.  12 m.d. Miss Oram once again stands at my bedside 4th time since I came to Egy. &amp; 3rd hospital.  Not so uncomfortable a visit as usual as M.O. says cooly, "she will not be in long I think" &amp; to my joy she goes.  No. B.O's, mag. sulph. 7 p.m.<br/>M.O. visits, wastes no time on any of us yet is just the correct man for this I imagine as is absolutely businesslike.</p>
