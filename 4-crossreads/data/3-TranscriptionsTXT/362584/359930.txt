 Dear Mrs Ferguson 
 I was greatly shocked to hear of Arthur's death. We were very close friends, &amp; had known each other for many years, as we were at School together, fellow Students together at College &amp; brother Officers in the 25th Infantry. 
 I shall miss him as one of my best chums &amp; as a friend that anyone would be proud of. I sincerely sympathise with you in your sad bereavement. Kindly remember me to His Honor &amp; to Dorothy &amp; convey my sympathy to them.
