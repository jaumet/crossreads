However we got over without being seen and after climbing a steep rocky hill we sat down and had a good rest, wet through with perspiration  After half an hours rest we moved off again and after going a mile I discovered that I had left an acyteline lamp behind where we had rested.  We had this lamp made so that we would be able to signal from the coast it was useless going back to look for it as the country was so rough so after much swearing we moved off again.  The country here was very rough so we had to keep resting about. midnight we came to a deep gully.  We were climbing down to cross my friend was leading the way, about three yards ahead of me, when I set a large stone rolling down on top of him.  I struck him on the foot and of course the result <strike>much</strike> more bad language.  However we managed to climb down without further mishaps but we had the worst to come for when we started to climb we had practically a sheer precipice in front of us.  However after hanging on by our toes and finger tips we managed to reach t the top without mishap: then we had half an hours rest.  Then we moved off and had another hours travelling.
