<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. 22.9.16<br/>5th August 1916.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>You will forgive me if this is a short note but I hear there is a mail leaving for Australia tomorrow &amp; there is just the slightest chance of catching it.  Last Sunday I found out where Walter was &amp; went out to see him.  I was thankful to find him quite well, &amp; so far A.1. as I had heard he had been wounded.  He was quite himself &amp; I thought he looked better than I've seen him for some time   He paid me a surprise visit again this afternoon, &amp; said he was on the move again tomorrow.  I understood him to say he had forwarded a cable to you stating he was O.K.  Very busy these days.  I have received all your letters to date 1st June for which I thank you very much.  Quite summer weather here now more like Egyptian than anything- very hot in day &amp; very cold with often a heavy dew at night.  Wal showed me a letter from you dated June 14th in which Ol had just reached home<br/>Trust she is well, unable to write her this mail.  Must also thank Anna for her interesting letter of June 1st &amp; must at same time congratulate her on the results of her School Exams.<br/>Arnold Hazlewood has been knocked but I don't</p>
