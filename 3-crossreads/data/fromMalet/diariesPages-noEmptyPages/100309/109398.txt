12/6/17 Paris
in their just and righteous anger and tearing into little pieces the selfish sensualists who did so much harm. Our guide amused us by saying that at one place "Marie Antionette used to make her extravagances". We saw some excellent mosaic work. One table represented the labour of 25 years ? the most exquisite design done in the tiniest pieces of stone fitted cunningly together in intricate design. On coming back to the entrance we went across to the Grand Trianon which we found closed but a little backsheese to the dame of the Guardien and a little flattery to an old gentleman who is conservator got us in being officers. Our guide was much perturbed because I made to tip this venerable conservator. These Trianons were the country houses of the king queen where they could live in a more homely fashion than in the immensity of Versailles palace itself. The Grand Trianon is quite as large as an ordinary palace. The rooms are all masterpieces of carving and painting. Here is an enormous vase of alabaster carved deliciously into intricate designs and patterns. In spite of its size there is an air of lightness about it.
