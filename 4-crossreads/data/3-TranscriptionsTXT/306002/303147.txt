15.5.15as he was walking along the path.  Negus was following with his rifle on his shoulder, the rifle was splintered & Negus only grazed.  Lieut. Nickoll received a bullet through his cap & the bullet grazed his head;  a good many of the lads have been scratched but not bad enough to put them out of action.  Cameron was scratched down the shin by a piece of shrapnel.  The sniper that got Lovett slightly wounded 5 men in a few minutes but they found out where he was hidden & poured in a pretty warm fire where he was, & we have heard nothing of him since.  I still have a rather bad cold & can get no medicine for it.  Wylie Woods died this morning.
