  
 (Napier) The bandage on my hand got saturated by Petrol which caught fire while I was looking for Lamps. My hand was burnt somewhat before I could extinguish the flames & worst of all the burns were superposed on the Septic finger. As a matter of fact I could'nt extinguish the flames but had to tear the Wadding Etc off including much skin. Result sick parade again. 
 Friday 7.12 The exhaust of our Napier ends in a Bath house. Two Tommies were in there on Tuesday having a bath & were later carried out unconscious having been overcome by the Gasses from the exhaust. Last night I was very sick & Giddy vomiting Etc & had to leave the engine room owing to the same cause. We developed a surprising load about 4.45 & blew about 5 or 6 Fuses untill I fused the circuits up to a point which nearly forbade Blowing altogether. I put the fuses in on the line circuit & 3 of them blew in my hands as soon as I made contact. 
 Sun. 9/12 Small Generator fitted with new fuses at Hasebrouck. Installed again 6.30P.M. Engine ran hot at about 9.00. Shut down. In the meantime we were working on the German Dynamo. All field coils repaired & replaced. No volts [small wiring diagram] opened each side of shunt field in burn [small diagram]. Generated O.K. (Series field disconnected) changed over one side of field. About 2000 Volts [small wiring diagram]
