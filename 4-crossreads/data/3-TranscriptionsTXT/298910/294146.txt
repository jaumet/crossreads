 Slept till midday &ndash; then got up &amp; had some dinner. Raining all night &ndash; cleaned up slightly in the afternoon &ndash; Bert Trail and I went for a stroll through the Village of "Faurelle". Our Division seems to be moving up &ndash; so expect we shall have to go in again. Got a Gas alarm about 2 am but nothing eventuated. Fritz shelling the Main Dressing Station all day &amp; night, several motor cars blown to pieces &ndash; one Sergeant killed &amp; many injured. Heard Fritz had retaken "Fresnoy", having used some new Gas on the Canadians.

 Very warm &ndash; dull to drizzling rain. We are camped alongside an Aerodrome and it is most interesting watching the Planes ascend &amp; descend. Wrote a long letter to Aunty Lyons. Colonel Manifold &amp; the A.D.M.S. addressed all the Bearers of the different Field Ambulances, he said he conveyed the highest compliments from General Gough &amp; General Birdwood about the way we worked under heavy fire
