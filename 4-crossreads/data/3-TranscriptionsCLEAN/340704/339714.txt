We then went into action dismounted. Fighting very hot. Our men dropping fast. Got a bullet thro my tunic singlet and cardigan - just grazed my right shoulder. Arm useless for a while. Company still advancing. Arm got better so I advanced in their track on my own. Plenty bullets flying round caught up to my section. Opened fire at 1100 yds. I was in charge of No.3 Lewis gun. My gunner shot in right arm alongside me. Joined up No 2 gun. Range now 500 fought all day under frontal and enfilading fire. 4 men and 1 officer shot 15 yds away from me. Several of our men wounded . Sgt P K Foster killed. Final sustained attack all along the line and Turks surrendered at 4.45 pm. 
 Came back to camels 31/2 miles away. Taubes had bombed the camels continuously several camels killed. My sections total 1 killed 8 wounded. Coys total 2 killed 1 officer and 16 men wounded. Moved off in the darkness back to El Arish.
