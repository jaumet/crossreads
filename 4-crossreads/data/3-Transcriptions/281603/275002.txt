<p>&amp; strengthening our position of a night.  Our stay only last 52 hours there  &amp; we were not troubled much although he tried to find our position with artillery, trench mortars &amp; machine guns but we only had four casualties in the company.  It was well into the night of the 1st of March when we were releived by the 5th battalion &amp; then moved back to dug outs in the maize.  We stayed six days there &amp; during that period I was able to have a good look over the ground which fritz first evacuated &amp; it was no wonder he did so for his 1st 2nd &amp; 3rd lines where simply torn to pieces by our artillery &amp; his dead were very thick everywhere &amp;  he had mines set everywhere too but luck favoured us &amp; all of these were unloaded without suffering any Casualties.  We were relieved from this position on the night of the 7th by the 20th Battalion &amp; moved back to Bazentin camp No. 2 &amp;  turn in about midnight all completely tired out for we had had a fairly strenuous time without much sleep the past eight days.  We moved off next morning however but our march was not far &amp; we went to Marmetz camp where we stayed a few days &amp; was able to clean ourselves &amp; felt much better.  On the 16th   we again moved off &amp; went to the village of Dernancourt &amp; it was my first visit to a village since the end of January &amp; we were able to buy plenty of food &amp; lived high during our stay there.  On the 21st we marched to billets at Ribemont &amp; on the 25th played the Brigade Trench  Morter</p>
