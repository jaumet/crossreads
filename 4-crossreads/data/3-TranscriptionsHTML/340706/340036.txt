<p>as there are about 12 men to be paid &amp; here this takes about 3 hours.</p>
<p>19-3-19<br/>Have decided to go quiet this week in order to amass cash &amp; have sworn off drink. Lecture to night on Rhodesia which was very interesting. Land abounds in parts &amp; wild animals &ndash; land is good but little is agriculturally used cattle raising being the main industry. Fences do not exist. Land is freely given but somehow I dont fancy going there. In fact huge wealth is necessary to make wealth while the climate is not exactly nice for a white woman.</p>
<p>If farm fail you cant hire yourself to next neighbour for manual work is left to the blacks who are given a small piece of land in return for so much labour.</p>
<p>20-3-19 Thurs.<br/>Usual routine &ndash; went to town with Mansell.</p>
<p>21-3-19 Friday<br/>Usual school with a lecture in evening by Mansell on his air experiences.</p>
