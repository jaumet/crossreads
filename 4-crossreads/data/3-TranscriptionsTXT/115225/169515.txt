Dec 31st  Jim stayed in bed till noon, Joe & I walked down to the barber at the station & had a hair cut & left our razors to be honed. We walked into Bailleul & had tea at Marie Louise's Joint & Frank & I went to the Dons at the concert hall. they were very good - we met Joe & Phil again at 8.15 P.M. & walked home to Park about 7 Kilo's. had a snack & waited up to see if we our guns were going to wish Fritz a happy new year. as we heard they would but nothing happened & we went to-bed & there ends the year 1917 - During which time I came to France & got quite a bit of experience, & have been from Rouen by lorry up through Amiens & Albert Doullens. St Poll. Bailleul. Dunkerque & back to Poperinghe & Ypres etc finishing up the year round Bailleul again. we have been parked during that time with eleven different M.T. Columns, attached for rations & dicipline -
The winter so far has been very mild, with practically no snow & January coming in like a lamb, will it as they say go out like a lion?
