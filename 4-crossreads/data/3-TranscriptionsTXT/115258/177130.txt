I left Port Said by the mid-day train on Saturday. Harold Thomas came up to the train to see me off. There was not anything of unusual interest on the trip up. Going down along the canal to past Kantara I was noticing the miles and miles of barb wire entanglements put on the Easten bank put there in 1915. To think that at certain intervals right across Sinai as far as El Arish there are similar defences, with hundreds of miles of wire, and also netting roads everywhere; I wonder if they are going to roll it all up - and if they do I hope they wont use us for it. It is wonderful to watch see the difference l in the le irigation land at the different seasons of the year, when you come through in the train. Although the country is all cut up into little 'chinamens' plots, and which are each worked independantly it seems to be the datteur to do certain things at certain times
