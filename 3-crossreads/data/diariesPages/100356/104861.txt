Revielle as per usual
All preparations are now complete for the move, all stuff is packed.
The Dorsets arrived today a scratchy scraggy lot they are too their horses are like ponies I'm hanged if I know what they intend doing with their swords. They are camped down on the new site where shelters are to be erected without delay, the timber is arriving daily. I had to take a lamp (gas) which Pard has just finished out to the hills for a trial left here at 6 it was rather a climb at night but it worked OK. was easy reading for those in camp the distance was about nine miles, left at 8 got back home at 9.30 tired out also got another puncture.
Bed at 10.50 after meeting last train.

Reveille as early as usual.
Packed all our traps today for the move tomorrow made arrangements for the cessation of the Signal Service, got instructions later to send 2nd class Telegraph set to Assiut cells to Qara.
Dorset crowd came down to take over the local lines of communications, they are garrisoning Sohag with 1 squadron, their H Qrs being at Malwadi 30 miles North of Assiut, our Tele station is to be cut out as they have no operators to do the job.
The wireless chaps are to go with us to Kantara are there to join up with the Squadron of whom we have heard nothing for the last 3 weeks.
Bed at 11.30 did the late run to the train.
