<p>modification of Shipways, for giving hot Ether for anaesthetic.  Heads much bucked over it.  Still a few things to do mainly for purpose of eyewash, in case A.D.M.S. etc come round inspecting.</p>
<p>Jeudi 9th Mai<br/>Very few cases coming through.  Prepared the weekly requisition in the morning.  Alterations carried out that I wished in my section so that it will be stronger in the future and easier for me as I now have a full corporal who knows his job well.  Major Furber now with his unity, rather strange as we came away on the same boat together from Australia.</p>
<p>Vendredi 10th Mai<br/>A few extra cases through as the result of raiding otherwise line very quiet.  Weather beautiful.  Engineers have now completer making the cellar gas proof &amp; are doing same with Dressing Station.  Completed fixing up of operating theatre, it now being very up to date.</p>
