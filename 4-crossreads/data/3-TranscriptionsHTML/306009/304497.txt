<p>1915<br/>Nov. 11 Thu.<br/>There are two islands in the Nile at Cairo &ndash; Gezira &amp; Rhoda. Gezira (Arabic for Island) is the larger &amp; one of the prettiest parts round Cairo  &ndash; it is joined up to the Mainland on either side by two bridges. Rhoda is rather a bleak looking spot &amp; is also connected to the mainland by 2 bridges on either side.</p>
