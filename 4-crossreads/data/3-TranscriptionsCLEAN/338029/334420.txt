The Campaigner
There's a heavy hearted laddieWeary and worn to-day,Now in his third year battleBiding the grim fate's sway.
Two years since the proclamationWhen impulse led him throughConventions hard unto a heartDiscipline never knew.Only one's heart, and not the worldKnow of the drill squad's test,When youth revolts at harsh commands,Recruits may know the rest.
An April day the palid dawnFound heroes all in rank,Sickly grins hid fluttering heartsFacing the unknown blank,Some were maddened by blood's desire,Scorning the hail of DeathSome remained to succour matesWatching their final breath.
Strong men recoiled at sight of blood,And weak turned into strong,And nerves beat drill & heart beat brawnWhen days just crawled along.Sickness and strain sent many toA shell free other land.Some saw it through but only fewObeyed Retreat's command.
