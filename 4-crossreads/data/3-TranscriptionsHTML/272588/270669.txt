<p>Sunday 3 March<br/>Dull with drizzling rain.  We went to A.D.S. to-day at Woormezeele to work on completing dugouts.  Very little is left of the village &amp; some graves about mention Oct. 1914, 1st Battle of Ypres.  I walked up to St. Eloi, of which nothing is left.  The country is rather hilly &amp; our people hold most of the high ground. Artillery lively in the afternoon but no casualties came through.</p>
<p>Monday 4 March<br/>Another visit to A.D.S. on fatigue work on dugout, placing concrete slabs on the top.</p>
