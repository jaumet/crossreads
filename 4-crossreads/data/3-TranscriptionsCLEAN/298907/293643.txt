  
 attack the Germans made on the Australians 3 days after I was cracked, our lads put up a great stunt & fought Heine to a standstill & beat him badly. 
 Another stab with the needle today & tonight my left arm is paining dreadfully & swollen almost to bursting point, & we have to have another one yet in a few days time to complete the course. 
 Hopped on a car after tea this evening & went for a ride down town & a bit of a walk through the streets bought a few cigars so tonight I am enjoying a smoke. 
 Put a little piece tonight in the Head Sisters Autograph book & also several of the nurses. 
 3rd.  Am getting on finely had quite a long run down the town
