  
 You can now stop sending me luxuries - old girl - Please don't do it any more - I have everything I want now. Another case of food & an enamel plate from Graham. I gave him 30/-. A plate will be a high luxury & will signify the grandeur of the C.O. 
 Owing to the censor work being too heavy on Capt. Smith, I am going to relieve him of some in the morning so cannot write more this mail. 
 Burdett - Tinson - Lawry all O.K but G.H. of Tumut away sick (8 officers absent altogether.) - - - - - 
 I did not hear how Clark got on with his appendicitis. Gibbs of Warrawee is well. Holliday's Bulletins come regularly & are very much prized. Have lots of writing paper now & envelopes. Have not seen Graham this trip but had letters from him. 
 I hope plenty of young men are enlisting, they seem to want plenty of pushing out. I think they will all be needed & wish there were a few more here - Enclosing some yellow lupin seeds of wh. there are such lots growing here. 
 22nd I often wonder if you get the photos I send you from time to time or have they been confiscated. 
 Your letters to me (just arrived) show you had letters from me from Alexandria. 4 leaved shamrock from Kit - - - Would like to see Phil in his soldier jacket. I did not get any tobacco from the Sun fund - nor con's socks - nor chewin' gum. Don't worry about more.
