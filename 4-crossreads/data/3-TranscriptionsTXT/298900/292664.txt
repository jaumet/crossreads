Went to a Communion Service today & no wine being available the service was carried on without my first experience of such a service.
Tuesday 2nd April     Very quiet, weather good.   Usual sick through during the day.  More hockey during the afternoon, my team winning 13 to nil.    New Zealanders are running the local train (narrow guage) as an Ambulance train, quite a decent stunt.   Bread very scarce, we being on biscuits the last 2 days.
Wednesday 3rd April   Usual routine, showery weather.   A very large number of soldiers in the village & thousands passing through daily some with splendid bands & troops looking well.   Two games of hockey today & won both my team being unbeaten so far.   Feeling very fit from the exercise.  Heard today, official on Tuesday, that General Gough of 5th Army had been relieved of his command, we had this rumour a week ago, one of the rare occasions a rumour came true.     Certainly the 5th army did not do well at all & its good to think that it was from faulty leadership rather than the squibbing of the men.
