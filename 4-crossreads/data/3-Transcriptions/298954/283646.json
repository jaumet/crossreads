<p>1918<br/>Tue 21st May<br/>Farewell trip to the Roblinsee swimming.   (I have grown to love Furstenberg and the Roblinsee and almost dropped salt tears into the limpid lake.)</p>
<p>Evening with Frampton, Clarke, Balfour and Ansell.</p>
<p>Wed. 22nd.<br/>A very mournful breakfast with James at the unholy hour of 6.15 am.   Dear old James almost wept into the cocoa, and Collinson (my orderly) acted as though attending my obsequies.</p>
<p>Quite a crowd <strike>attended</strike> gathered at the gate to Farewell Jago and I, well forward being Frammy in negligie (very much so.)</p>
<p>To leave their beds at such an hour showed such genuine "palliness" that I again almost sobbed.   (Isn't this a tearful page?   Tears have been about to be shed in the Roblinsee, in the cocoa, down my back, and at the barbed wire gates!)</p>
