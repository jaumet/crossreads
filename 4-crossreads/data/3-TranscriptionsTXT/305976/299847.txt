judgement by heads. They are only stirring up strife & trouble. Disturbance in camp which may have ended disastrously only for some level headed Officers. O C of camp I was told conspicuous by absence.Friday April 6Our OC took us out to hills & we had a yarn to fill in time. Pity he was not in O.C. camp position. Although stern, he is just & in my opinion a born leader. Left for dear old Sydney at 7pm.Train absolutely packed.Saturday April 7A very cold journey across. Was one change at Albury station from one train to other. Packed in like Rabbits for export. Have come to conclusion some people are of opinion that Soldiers are Cattle.
