<p>August 17 Saturday 1915<br/>Posted letter Home. Working all day.<br/>The Natives have a loving regard for our Prickly Pear. They so care for the plant that is not only grows to a Great Height, but the fruit is as large as a Quince. I wondered what the people of all shades &amp; position stood around different carts standing in the streets &amp; swallowed as fast as the Hawker could manage, Fruit rich and Lusious, &amp; thoroughly enjoyed by all, until I found it to be the Fruit of the Pear. The hawker stands at his cart &amp; rapidly peels the outer skin as the buyer swallows the fruit.</p>
<p>August 18 Wednesday 1915<br/>Working all day. Heard a rumor that the Post Office Staff would be transferred to England in a few weeks. Corporal Grice returned from Cairo, also the Staff connected with the wounded parcels.<br/>Received another letter from Home dated the 11th July "alls well"thank god.<br/>It is just lovely to walk along the breakwater after sun set for an hour or two, the cool ocean breeze gives one an appetite. I like to have a drink of boiling milk after the walk. 1 piastre per glass.</p>
<p>August 19 Thursday 1915<br/>Received letter from Victor Convas. Working all day. Plenty to keep one going, as long lists of wounded are arriving from hospitals.</p>
<p>Among the many sad letters that we look at during our day, sorting, one particularly came under my notice. A young woman in Victoria had been ruined by one of the soldiers now at the front, &amp; after waiting some time for a letter &amp;receiving none she wrote one of the most hardened &amp; awful worded notes to him, that a woman could put together. It made me shiver to think that a woman could put in words, the dreadful things the letter contained. Doubtless the man deserved it all.<br/>August 20 Friday 1915<br/>Working all day today feeling better &amp; stronger. Another batch of men off to the front today. Just heard that Dr Verge of the 6th Regiment is in 17 Gen Hosp suffering from Dysentry. A large number of men who are convalescent are being sent to Lemnos Island to clear the Hospitals &amp; Homes here, &amp; Cairo, for further wounded.</p>
