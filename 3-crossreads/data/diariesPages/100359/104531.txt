We started off again at about 12.30 after having had a spell for an hour and a half. The Band struck up again and we started off to Moaska, about 8 or 9 miles away up to this time we had fairly solid ground to march on but now we got into the loose sand and it was jolly hard work plodding on, over the boot tops in the soft sands and the sun pouring on us. We scattered out across the desert in squads, doing the best we could with our limited supply of water. Some of the poor beggars were quite delirious. One chap we came across a Sergeant kept singing out for his mother, he had torn almost all his clothes off and was rolling about in the sand. We picked him up and almost carried him for about 2 miles when we came across a corporal of the same Company, so we left him in his care and made the best of our way into camp, as our water bottles were empty and we could do no good, besides being almost beat ourselves. Billy May and Stan Wright carried the packs of some of the fellows for a considerable distance, but were mighty glad to drop them again. It was pitiful to see the hundreds, or I might say thousands of men lying about
27.
in all attitudes, all singing out for water, and we hadn't a drop to give them, some of them had erected shelters by fixing their bayonets on their rifles, sticking them in the ground and tying their waterproof sheets to them. Out of 5 thousand men who left Moama that morning only 300 or 400 managed to last out the distance, the remainder being scattered over the desert.
