<p>Bulford<br/>16-1-17<br/>Dear George,<br/>Your letter of the 14-11-16 has just reached me   &amp;   I am glad to learn from it that you have had a good time   It is as you know now a lovely place for a Holiday.  At whose place did you stay?  Yes, the Ferns down Leura beat the Lot but the Best pass that I visited was the National Pass.  Did you take on the Baths at Leura.  I wonder if Son Barry who was supposed to have taken up a Dental Practice on the Mountains ever takes it on.  I never saw Medlow Lake   &amp;   did not know that it existed.  I never went beyond Leura   &amp;   have not even been to Govett's leap.  You don't have to take the Train for snow over here.  It has been freezing for the last 3 days   &amp;   ice lies about everywhere.  I think it is going to snow to-night.  It falls so soft that you never know anything about it, but Gee when it starts to thaw ugh the cold   &amp;   the muck   &amp;   slush.  Yes, Alf Cohen is nice but they are all nice, Arthur Burnie it's just the same.  I am very proud to have such a fine lot of cousins I can assure you.  Our English Cousins are fine too.  I have not seen the Grimsby ones but I write a letter every week.  Jennie is my own age but is just a girl in Her ways.  Marie has had to amuse herself all through the years &amp; has dozens of Hobbies or rather accomplishments.  She is a Botanist, Poetess, Naturalist, dairymaid, cook, singer, musician, house-keeper, I think</p>
