<p>[1 Jan. contd]<br/>I cleaned my bivvie out &amp; got the sand out of it, shook the blankets &amp; made it tolerably wind proof .  Then I made my bed.  Spurway &amp; I had tea on bully &amp; bread &amp; marmalade, &frac34; loaf  bread, 1 tin bully &amp; &frac34; tin marmalade.  The wind has not blown away our apatites thats one thing- Im comfortable now tucked in the blankets with my feet stuck in a long mail bag which I pinched.  This is verily the life  What a bosker New Year!</p>
<p>4th Thursday Jan<br/>The year has not improved a scrap, wind &amp; rain &amp; duty, Patrol monday, Observation post Tuesday, picquet Tuesday night &amp; all day Wed, then out post at night, &amp; did'nt it rain, blankets got wet &amp; I couldnt dry them to day, have to go one short to night, orders to put an extra one on the horse.  Wet blankets to sleep in its Bosker.  Last night A squadron went out after some Beduions, I heard some shots while on out post last night.  They made a small capture.  Brien again hurt his back yesterday &amp; had to be taken away to day he seems pretty crook, cold as north pole</p>
