(31)that the enemy advance guard had reached to a position about three miles in front of us and was resting and reorganising.  Scouting 'planes of both sides were now active flying about getting information.
An old trench system (made by the French at the beginning of the war) was converted by us into fairly good trenches but our dugouts were very rough and crude - a sheet of tin or a door from one of the houses in the village with plenty of straw on the bottom of the trench - these were our shelters.  Later on we made several visits to the houses and had our trenches decked up with cushions, window curtains &c.  Our trench was only about 100 yards in front of the town.
In the afternoon Germans were observed in the village of Sailly Laurette (about a mile in front of us) and a patrol of British cavalry was sent out to dislodge them, which they did with only one casualty to themselves.  It was the first and only time that we saw cavalry in action during the war and it was a fine sight.  The country where we were was really beautiful.  It consisted of green fields and crops of wheat &c.  Flocks of sheep and cattle (which the French hadn't time to take away when they evactuated the village) browsed on the hills just in front of our trenches.  The ground was free from shellholes and the absence of noise gave the place more an aspect of peace than of war.  This was all to be changed within forty eight hours.  We were very tired after our five days marching &c., and all slept well that night - not a gun being fired (we or the Germans had no big guns up ready to fire).  Of course we kept watch as usual.
Next day we explored the village which contained some fine houses well kept and beautifully furnished.  The lovely clothes and family treasures (paintings, statues &c) were fine.  The Mayor's house was very nice and contained a fine piano.  The cellars were also full of wine - we filled our water bottles with it and also brought many bottles back to the trenches.  Nothing to my mind is more refreshing than sweet red wine, especially when our drinking water was generally bad.  We got back to our trenches when it was dark and time for business.  Had a quiet night.
The next day was also very quiet and we could walk on top and in front of our trench without being fired on by the enemy.
Four days had now elapsed since the Germans had sat down to rest and reorganise after their great advance and victory.  If they had kept going, instead of resting for these few days to reorganise their army, they very probably would have captured Amiens (which was their objective - 11 miles away) as there were practically no troops to block them.  But by this time we had many guns up ready to fire and also plenty of troops.  The Hun now thought that he would resume his victorious march and capture Amiens, but he didn't succeed as his opponents were Australians who repeatedly hurled him back as he made his attacks.  It was Easter Saturday, 30th March 1918, the nicest day that we had had for over a month and the sun was shining beautifully.  All the morning things had been very quiet - not even a gun being fired.  The only noise was from the aeroplanes as they cruised about the skies.
