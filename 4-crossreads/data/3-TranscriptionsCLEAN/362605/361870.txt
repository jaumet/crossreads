lovely fruit that you were buying & eating, but I hope to share them with you & also to taste our fruit from our very own trees this summer.
I was astonished to hear of poor Marion's death.  It is an awful occurrence when she was so young & all the world before Her.
What rot about Billy getting married.  Billy Allison is here in this camp with me & is my constant companion as ever, & is no more married than I am.  I shall not be marrying.  I have met one Girl here that I would have married, but everyone writing, "Don't bring an English wife out", deferred my action, & I have lost perhaps the best woman that I have ever met.  It does not matter very much though.  I can be quite happy, single; I shall have to work very hard when I get back & I shall not want to be running about with Girls anymore;  I am past that stage now & have my own hobbies to occupy my time fully & contentedly.
