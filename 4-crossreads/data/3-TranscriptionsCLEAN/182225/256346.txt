 1916   TUESDAY 15   AUGUST 
 Fine with a few showers during the day. I went down to the dentist in no 16 Camp in the morning & he took a tooth out & made a hell of a mess of my jaw doing it. I did a bit of gun drill in afternoon. Our battery went out on the horses in morning & made a holy show of themselves. About a quarter of them were thrown. Got an Australian mail & letters from Jo, Father M rs  LLoyd & Linda
