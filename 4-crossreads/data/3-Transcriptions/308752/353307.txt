<p>the streets were strewn with bottles, furniture, stores &amp; goods from the shops. Things were so bad I believe that now every shop is closed &amp; if more than four Australian Soldiers are seen approaching the natives etc. flee for their lifes &amp; lock the doors of the shops etc. We read about the terrible Germans,  <strike>Australians,</strike> the <u>Australians</u> are now following in their footsteps. The other day the 31st Battalion from Melbourne were marching along, when a little native about 10 years old approached one of the men, asking him to buy cigarettes.   The hoodleum (he cannot be called any thing else) grabbed a big tin of cigarettes from the kid, the native naturally thrust his arm out for the tin, when he received a big gash in his hand from a pen knife &amp; told to go to --- hell. The hand was afterwards treated by one of our A.M.C. Doctors. This is only one of the numerous cases that has occurred since my arrival in Egypt. There is no need to treat the natives like dogs. <strike>would not be at all surprised to see a native rising any day, but</strike> The English &amp; Indian troops tell us that the Australian soldiers are excellent fighters, but no discipline. Eric arrived back to day he looks A.1. I think 17 pages is quite enough so must close with much love<br/>From your only son<br/>xxxx Langford Colley-Priest<br/>&amp; your mountain son Eric.</p>
