has turned out as faithful an animal as one could possibly find.Every morning he wakes me at about 5 am by neighing loudly, being picketed close beside where I sleep. Even now he is watching me as he chews the Hay which I generally throw him of at night time.The Guns are again going 19 to the Dozen so I suppose it will be a long time before I get to sleep.This is our 4th Day on hard Biscuits, there being no fresh Bread available I can tell you it is rotten. All my gums are sore with the Hard Surface they present which has to be chewed a lot before it can be swallowed.

Great news has reached us, viz that the Australians after a gallant furious Battle have expelled the Germans from Poizeires occupied the High ridge which is the dominating position of the Picardy District.If they can successfully hold on to it the Artillery can get into position big things may be looked for in the immediate future.The weather still holds good it is to be hoped that it will continue to do so.B Cousins went to Hospital today I fancy I have seen the last of him this side of Australia as he is a moral for a return trip.
