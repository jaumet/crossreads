<p>had been watering their horses.   Just before I reached the 4th Bn. I met Bill Graham of the Pioneers he was surprised to see me for he thought I was in England, a few minutes more &amp; I had reached the 4th Bn. &amp; they showed me the way to Hqrs.   I went past them &amp; round the back way to the town were I left the boys, the roads were in a horrible condition &amp; it was raining nearly the whole time &amp; I was wet to the skin by the time I got back I took the bike back to the Engineers &amp; came down &amp;</p>
