<p>12.5.15<br/>comfortable, several New Zealanders were wounded &amp; a mule killed.  The bullets have been whistling over us but they cannot touch us here.  At one oclock we came along a valley in which a road has been made;  in several places we had to double passing dangerous points &amp; soon arrived handy to the firing line &amp; made ourselves as comfortable as we could on the side of the hill:  one of our boys was shot while going for water.  Twenty odd men a day are sniped off here &amp; the noise of the rifles, machine guns, shrapnel &amp; hand grenades is deafening.  We boiled our quart pots &amp; had tea early &amp; were soon dug into the hill &amp; fell to sleep despite the noise of the firing.  My cold is still bad &amp; cannot get medicine.</p>
