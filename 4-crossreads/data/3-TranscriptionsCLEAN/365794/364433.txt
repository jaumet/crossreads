Friday, 1st February 1918Rose 7 a.m., breakfast & then Palace Gardens & beautiful La France roses gathered - walked to Bella Donna's house, shopped, then sailed away on the Nile till time to pack & so ends one wonderful week in the "land of long ago". We watch the sunset from the garden steps & say farewell perhaps forever to one friend who must off to the war again so soon.  Train 7 p.m. dining car meal Pt. 30, sleeper Pt. 75 (i.e. 15/-), all comfortably fitted up & very smooth travelling.  In my purse I have Pt. 46 when leaving Luxor, arriving Cairo Pt. 14, but it is enough & the coin well spent in learning so much.  Assouan is never fading for its beauty & Luxor with its wonderful temples.
