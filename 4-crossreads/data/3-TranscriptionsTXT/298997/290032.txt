 I was searching for wood in what remains of the trenches  before after  above Irish House &ndash; they are so battered that in places, the hollows are in front or behind the trenches, which are filled up, &amp; the barbed wire is battered down, or covered with upheaved soil &ndash; I dragged some old  remants  remnants of sacking from what I thought might be posts among amongst some wire &amp; found a skeleton, of what by his clothes was a Tommy.  He must have fallen in an attack, against the wire, which he seemed to have grasped.  I hunted up a padre, &amp; told him about it, so that he could arrange for the burial.
