  
 1918 Mon. 11th Feb. The "Lyric Lambs" gave a concert tonight in the Juniors Mess-Room.   (The "Juniors" is now, by the way, in a deplorably filthy condition.   The stewards have taken advantage of the present excitement to suspend all work). 
 The guests sat on rolled-up hammocks on the deck;   the fortunate owners of hammocks on the top now reposed gracefully therein during the performance.  These latter had a habit of accidentally flicking the ashes of their cigarettes on to the heads of those below (the cigarettes are made usually of any sort of paper and a mixture of dried tea-leaves and "nigger twist.")   The "Lambs" were resplendent in somewhat mildewed gold-laced uniforms.  The "orchestra" consists of a violin with two strings, a banjo, a flute and a mandolin. 
 The mandolin-player is the only one who can play.
