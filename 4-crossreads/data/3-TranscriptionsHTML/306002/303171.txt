<p>1.6.15<br/>was shot on Sunday morning.  Last night a good many New Zealanders came &amp; camped at the bottom of Popes Hill.  At dinner time to-day Major Granville told Sergeant Mack to call for two volunteers to go up the valley between the Turk trenches &amp; our own.  Fletcher &amp; I volunteered, we are to go after dark &amp; do not know yet what we are to go for.  We went into the trenches at 4 o'clock to relieve the men now in 24 hours in the trenches &amp; 24 out is the daily "menu" here.  Soon after going in Maj. Granville &amp; Lieut. Kater came along &amp; gave instructions of what we had to do after dark in Dead Mans Gully, we have to explore it &amp;</p>
