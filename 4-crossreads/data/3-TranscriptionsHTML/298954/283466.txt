<p>1917<br/>2nd June (cont.)<br/>I found the Capt. standing at the door of the Chart-house with the Chf. Engr.  He repeated his instructions to do nothing, so I asked for, and obtained, permission to destroy the wireless station.  Then followed a busy half-hour smashing up the work of the last fortnight.  I first put the codes, logbook etc overboard.  The complete receiver was wrenched from the table and followed the papers.  In fact, when I finally closed the Wireless Cabin door and slipped out to see the Hun boarding party coming towards us there was very little of the gear left.</p>
<p>By this time we had, under instructions from the 'plane, steamed in towards the raider, which steamed slowly round us.  A launch was coming towards the "Wairuna": it came alongside at the after well-deck &amp; a party of armed sailors, led by an officer, swarmed over the side.</p>
