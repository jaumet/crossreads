7/6/16.
Reveille at 2 A.M. Marched out of camp, and entrained at Etaples. It was my first ride in the truck marked "Hommes 40. Chevoux 8". Travelled via Bolougne Calais. Did not travel very fast. "Bluey" McMasters fell out of the train and had time to run after it and catch up. Arrived at the railhead, about 3 P.M. Detrained and marched to where the Battalion is in reserve to the "Bailly" sector. Am billeted in a deserted farm house, not far from the firing lines, as I can see all the flares that illuminate "No Mans Land" at night. The Germans are using a curious rocket far behind their line. They look like strings of flares and they rise to a great height. The front seems quiet and is nothing like what I expected to see. A dispatch rider has arrived with orders for us to go and reinforce the 11th Battalion.
