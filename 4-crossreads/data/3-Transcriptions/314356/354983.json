<p>December 7, 8<br/>27.<br/>A reported conversation of two evil geniuses &hellip;</p>
<p>M.J. Hay.  But if we stop them going, they'll probably kick up a row and write to the Minister for Defence &ndash; a Hughes!</p>
<p>Mj. M.r.II.  Well we'll have to chance that!</p>
<p>"What a crowd!"<br/>"What a crew!!"  G.B.S.</p>
<p>December 8<br/>28.<br/>From Mother &ndash; things are crook!  Maurie and self away to Chatelat this afternoon &ndash; and a finding there of no money for Blighty, and up to the Chateau tonight after money find here awaiting &pound;12 from Tabb'd --!... Mac.</p>
<p>December 9, 10<br/>Brussels<br/>29.<br/>Midnight, and back from an evening spent at the Opera &ndash; Thais &ndash; with a wounderful Thais and a splendid [indecipherable] [Palemon ?].  Arriving Brussels 5.40 we'd just time to book seats &ndash; separately in different parts of the house.  Met there Jack M., Elk and another of the Amb.  After to the [indecipherable], disappointing but good beer there.</p>
<p>So to bed.</p>
