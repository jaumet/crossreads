  
 a large Cathedral to watch the Orphan Boys & Girls going to Sunday School they were all dressed in black the Girls from 4 years to 14 years wore black Silk dresses with straw hats trimmed with Black Silk in tucks & they look very pretty, their sweet faces blended well with their dresses & the boys wore back Serge Suits with black caps with shiny peaks & they all looked well which shows that the Authorities look after their child folk, the Elder Folk also were in large numbers going into church, after satisfying our curiosity we went along further, we promenaded the streets until close on 4 Pm having spent the time very pleasant we made our way to the Station & into the Y.M.C.A. for a Cup of Tea & chocolate & had a rest. Our train soon came alongside the Platform & we were soon seated, it was fairly well crowded & started off well to time & after several stops to put down Soldiers we arrived in Poperinghe at 6 Pm & walked steady back to our Camp where we had Tea & a chat to all the boys inquiring where different Battalions were, having brought a list of the 3rd & 4th Divisions with me, I gave a lot useful information
