  
 Tuesday 19 June 1917. 
 Reveille at 5 a.m. Went up on deck and land is now to be seen on either side. We are now in the Straits of Sinai. Land rugged and of a limestone sandy formation no vegetation. Speed slow and boats to be seen the whole day. Through these Sts we passed Sinai and were then in Gulf of Suez. Arrived in Suez harbor at 6.15 pm. Launches came alongside with naval & military officers. 2 aeroplanes were circling over a number of very large oil  drums  tanks on coast & apparently guarding them. Dropped anchor at 7. pm. In harbor is a sunken boat with bridge only showing. A pretty sunset noted. 
 Disembarkation tomorrow morning.  
 (Another case of C.S.M. at 11 pm?)
