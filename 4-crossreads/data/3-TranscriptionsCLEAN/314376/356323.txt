  
 12. fine place. 
 When I was at Liverpool the accommodation for the men comprised of huts of which there were about 30 in all and when it came to my turn to shift I could note they were starting to put spring mattresses and bedsteads arranged so as to accommodate 4 men at once. We used to hold Church parades on a Wednesday mostly. The Sunday Parades were cut out on account of most of the men going to town for the week-end. As a matter of fact it was most difficult to secure men sufficient to fill a guard those days. 
 This was only because at the time the men were more accustomed to civil-life than soldiering and wanted their week-end at home. This has altered much as time went on now we don't seem to mind
