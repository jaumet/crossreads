<p>Well, Mrs Dunlop, my good looks got me the job of representing our lot amongst 25 officers from the Division.</p>
<p>As the rendezvous had been bombarded by Taubes fairly often, we had a couple of our planes overhead all the time to see fair play.  Later on, the trophys of guns, mortars &amp; machine guns captured in the last "stunt", were inspected as they stood in a village square, close by.</p>
<p>Dr Douglas left here to-day as he is returning to Australia. I had dinner with him a week ago &amp; he told me Dr Horsfall was away with the Navy. It must be hard on him with his partner going away &amp; leaving the practice to locums. At least I should image so. It is a wonder he did not wait until Dr Douglas returned. All ranks were sorry to lose the "wee" captain &amp; his major told me that he was one of their best officers. I hear that Drs Eames &amp; Dick are listening to 99, 100 in The Old Country still.</p>
<p>We have had quite an epidemic amongst our captive observation Balloons the past week. The Huns consider we are too inquisitive &amp; over comes a couple of their "planes".</p>
