<p>front &amp; not here"? Said he "SS Prince Abbas sailed past 1 hour early without orders". I said "y' thats the way you allow yr.[indecipherable] communication, its no wonder we all complain so". However he sent us to Afternoon Tea in the saloon &amp; the purser gave us cabins of the best &ndash; a steward brought hot water &amp; etcs.</p>
<p>About an hour after I had a bath &ndash; was just about to shave when in dashed the adjutant "looking for you everywhere &ndash; thought you'd gone ashore &ndash; the Prince Abbas we stopped along the coast &amp; brought back &ndash; going in 5 minutes. So I knew then I had time for a shave etc &ndash; washed my one handkerchief &ndash; repacked &amp; went aboard the 5th boat since leaving the shore. Rutledge had 4 parcels &amp; I had the 3 &amp; everywhere one had to climb up &amp; down ships sides &amp; move ships in relays.</p>
<p>After an hour the Abbas sailed &ndash; got dinner on board. French Company. Tipped the steward &amp; got a cabin.</p>
<p>At 10 that night we arrived at Anzac &amp; stopped 6 miles from the shore as the Fr. Egyptian Capt didn't like the shells closer in. At 2.a.m. the Dr. Major woke us &amp; said a lighter of the men was just leaving but would we care to wait till light. We preferred to wait in comfort. Some rats feasted on my chocolate kept for the shore!</p>
<p>At 11 a.m the trawler Lock Esk came &amp; after carrying away one gangway to pay the Egyptian Skipper out for something, got alongside. After most of the wounded men were put on I climbed down by the rigging of the trawlers &amp; began to get our 7 packages down. Rutledge had all his cases (1 being Knox's) on the Abbas &amp; I was below with his goods &amp; most of mine when a German submarine appeared about 50 yds off.</p>
<p>The skippers yelled &ndash; the ropes cut &ndash; the other gangway was carried away in a shower of splinters &ndash; the Greek crew of the Abbas chucked fits on their various decks &ndash; the Egyptian Capt. crossed the bridge 3 times before he cld. find his engine telephone. The Lk. Esk backed &amp; the Abbas with Rutledge &amp; my Knox box disappeared in a cloud of spray to Imbros Island &amp; was not heard of for 24 hours &ndash;</p>
<p>My Captain returned to the Gascon &amp; put back remainder of wounded &amp; after arguing the point with him, I went on board her &ndash; the 7th boat in the journey. The submarine had not appeared again but had she come alongside, I shld. have jumped on the 8th boat &amp; driven a boat hook through her. The Gascon not so good as the Sicilia &ndash; but I got lunch &amp; met a nurse friend of Olive's named Durham from Sydney Hospital.</p>
<p>About 4.30 the Lock Esk recovered &amp; came</p>
