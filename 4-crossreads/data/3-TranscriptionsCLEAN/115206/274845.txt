  
 October 1918. Wednesday 2 
 On right of Bellicourt behind Nooroy. Weather warm and fine. Walked over and repaired Bdge Line, Fritz particularly busy shelling Bellicourt village. Cavalry came back from Le Catelet, not having done too good owing  to the amount of wire and m.g. nests, yet to be cleared by tanks. Visited the St Quentin Canal and viewed the supposed boiling down chamber used by the Bosche to extract the fats of the human body. Personally I consider the place has been a cook house or something of the kind. A fair number of tanks and armoured cars going up.
