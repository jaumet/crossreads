 1918 June 5 Wednesday Travelled per train to Wymiss Bay in the morning thence by boat across to Rothesay - up through the Kyles of Bute as far as Adrishaig via Tarbert & Tin-En-Bough & other places. This is a very beautiful trip mostly through narrow passages with the hills running right down to the waters edge on either side - timbered mostly along the foothills with flowers intermingled & dwellings built here & there & nestling in beautiful surrounding with the hills behind mostly grassy on the sides & rising & terminating in rocky crests. Altogether very beautiful arrived back about 7 P.M.
