<p>To Lt Cousins<br/>A relief is anticipated for tomorrow night. In view of the large amount of material to be moved bring in all guns &amp; material to your dugout. Stack all bulk S.A.A as safe as possible behind dugout, don't forget to camouflage it &amp; let me know the amount. Get all guns, spare parts, condensors etc &amp; 2 belts per gun also into cover at your dug out.</p>
<p>The remainder of the belts &amp; boxes to be brought up here after dusk where it will be dumped &amp; camouflaged, so as to facilitate quick move out as soon as any order comes through. there may be a faint chance of a move out during the night.</p>
