 My dear Mrs Burrows. 
 As Sergeant of the platoon of which your husband was a member, I wish on behalf of the men to express their deepest sympathy to you in the loss of your husband. 
 I wish also to express the deep regret that is felt by all the men of the platoon, at losing a friend, who was both a soldier and a man. 
 He was a grand soldier and a good comrade. He had greater experience than most of us, as a soldier, and used his experience to help & cheer the younger men with us. 
 Concerning his death, he was killed almost instantaneous by concushion from a shell which burst where he was lying, so suffered no pain. 
 Hoping God will help you to endure your loss, and that you will remember he did his best -  He died for his friends, I remain Yours in Sympathy J. W. Nunn Sgt.
