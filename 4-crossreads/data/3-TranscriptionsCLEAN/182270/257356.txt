 THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1919. 
 Fine & cold. Reported at 
 20 Belgrave Square in the 
 morning & got my marching 
 orders to go to Sutton Veny 
 tomorrow.  Went round & 
 fixed things up afterwards 
 & got a big mail at the bank 
 & packed everything up. 
 Went round & said good 
 bye to Dot Brunton 
 after tea.
