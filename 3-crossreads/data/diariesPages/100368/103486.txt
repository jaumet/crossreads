In spite of the fact that this fire has been burning two nights and a day, there is a tremendous amount still to be burned up yet. A large number of bottles of beer and champagne etc. were destroyed last night. These belonged to our officers. Such luxuries could never be allowed to common rank and file Oh! No, No. Ordered to take our packs down to the shelter and to parade there at ten thirty to-night. Put up a notice on our dug-out "Apartments to let" Apply. When we come back again. A large number of troops with muffled feet passed on their way to the beach, to embark. A beautiful moonlight night and the sea nice and calm. As we waited quietly on the weary hours passing away we were provided with music from the gramophone which had only been in use in the officers mess previously. The one tune that was the favourite and was played over a few times was "the Rosary". A copper had been placed near the shelter and our cooks made cocoa for us. The floor of the shelter was covered with hospital mattresses and on these we all lay huddled to-gether till the time should come for us to depart. Strange to say not a shell has been sent over to-night. The slightest sound made us prick up our ears expecting every minute to be heavily bombarded.
