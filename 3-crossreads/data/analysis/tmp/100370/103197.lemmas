 countri of Judea . It is a most interest sight to see , the small patch of land , some as small as twelv feet squar ( about ) which the nativ have cultiv . These patch which lie like dozen of small terrac of green , all the way up the mountain side , repres the onli visibl soil , among the ancient , time worn rock cover and crown these height , and have onli been made workabl by dint of much manual labour in clear them of the smaller stone . For centuri , like enough , they have been there , hand down from father to son , each in their turn wrest from these pin point fragment of fertil a labori and precari live . These hill inde , save for the beauti flower thrust their delic stalk up and the sunlight everywher , show natur in her ugliest and most sullen mood , bare bristl teeth man effort to her children 's effort to gain a livelihood on her face . No effort of imagin could call them beauti . They are too rug and stern for that . Just after we commenc our climb , on the right of the road we saw a broken stone pillar , I suppos near two feet in diamet . Sever fragment of it were lie on the opposit side of the road . On one of the larger block were trace of a time worn inscript . We had halt a few minut , and tri to make out the inscript , but onli some letter remain , but enough to make it Roman origin clear . This was what were the letter we could deciph , I.M.P. Caesar . But it is veri worn , and even some of these letter we had to guess at . But there it stand , a monument at one and the same time , to the genius and power of the men and Empire whose legion in the dim past march this way , and a silent testimoni in it ruin of the frailti of earth pomp and power . As the column ruin lie , where onc it rear itself one so the glorious Empire whose progress it mark has long sinc crumbl into decay , and ruin .
