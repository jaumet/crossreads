 Saturday 25 January 1919 Just got a letter from Debrett, England, asking for particulars as to education, birth, etc. etc. for insertion in re D.S.O. Jim Ayre has a job in Cairo, he sent me some Australian letters he had got &ndash; best rumour that Neilson Mills is going to marry Mrs. Ainslie!!  This from Frank Chase who came into my Brig. for a yarn. Cold better, may get leave to Cairo tomorrow, this does me good. 3 Australasians arrived together, many thanks for sending same &ndash; also local paper.
