 Lyon 27/3/16 Daybreak show a pleasant countrysid full of small farm , the countri most dens popul , the farm hous be continuo and gather everi few mile into substanti town . The tree were elm , poplar all were just break into leaf although we pass mani wood that were not even sprout . The Rhone is a fine river and was swollen , run a swift current . Alder and other tree line the bank . Cultiv divid the hillsid and valley into small block all beauti neat and trim and tree plant in row . Lyon is a fine citi and some good bridg span the Rhone there . At factori we pass German prison were work under the guard of French tomme . Soldier are on guard at public build c. After the glare sand of Egypt , this beauti green land is enchant . Trim littl meadow " not with dais pie " , but with primros violet jonquil spangl the grass . On the orchard bough black bird were sing . Blossom of all kind made the orchard gay . We now branch off up the Soan and notic some peopl wear a local costum much like the Greek . Upon the Gare Lyon we saw some sentri wear the steel helmet . If we had been pass through here a week or so henc the place would have been still more enchant as the tree would then be cover with their leav . The poplar is a veri popular tree . For mile we seem to be go through suburb , the hous some of them veri old were close togeth but each had it garden or small meadow surround it . Once we pass an enorm cut which was so larg that one had doubt whether it was not natur .

Walk the countri road and in the street all the women appear to be in black .
