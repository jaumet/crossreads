Thursday 23 January 1919RafaThe Two Up School keeps me awake till midnight each night.  I gave my Batman a 1 for pourboire and he won 33/-/- in one night, some other poor devil lost!  Very cold & Bronchitis bad.  Trying to write up History of Regt. but with Drill Orders & interruptions it is an impossible task.  We are supposed to give men Technical Training for after-war life.  The Lectures are a farce given by Amateurs who are very nervous & the men feel it is sort of "Trying it on the dog" business as no one else would listen.
