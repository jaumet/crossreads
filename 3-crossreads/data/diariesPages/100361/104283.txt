Mon Oct 8. 
Drizzly wet day. "Matts" went away yesterday. There was no French class again tonight. Madame must be "Boker malade". Gee: I'll forget what bit I learnt. 
After Tea wrote France and Arthur, and sent Xmas Cards to Dave and Ruth.
Tues 8. 
What rotten weather. Did some washing today but I'm hanged if I can get it dry. There are all sorts of rumours floating about. Austria and Turkey are said to have "thown in the Towel", but it's not official.
Wed 9. 
Got letter from Mrs Sam yesterday. Am has been made Srgt. That's what "gets" me. Here am I bumming around the Camp, unfit for the Line and I've got no bloomin? chance of promotion. "Oh: it's a lovely war", I don't think.
Thur 10.
This is a great country for Rain. They never ought to be short of water, yet they sometimes are. The war news continues good. I really think the war will end in my time.
Fri 11.
No French class again ? Madame is ill. Gee: I'll just about forget what little I learnt.
I really must try and write some Letters. I'm hanged if I seem to get ant time to myself lately.
Sat 12. 
The sun actually shone for a few minutes today, Glory: Alleluia: 
Got some more Mail today. 2 from M.S., 1 from Mother and a tract of some kind from some Society in Sydney. Very kind of ?em to take so much interest in me, I'm sure. Lill sent me two lovely snaps of herself, one holding the wonderful Baby. Gee: B.E. does look bonnie. She's the sweetest kid on this old earth and I do believe she knows it but tells me she is "Just an ordinary Person". 
Had Vapour Bath and donned clean change. Put in for Leave Pass for tomorrow.
Sun 13. 
Went into Havre. Intended to visit Art Gallery, but no one seemed to know where it was. Bought some P. Cards to send Lill. Had Tea at a Caf near the Sal Army 4.20 but came away still feeling hungry.
Wrote Letter 41 to M.S.
