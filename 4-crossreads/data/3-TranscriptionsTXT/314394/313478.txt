 1st September. Visited G" Company special R.E. 3rd. Corps and witnessed experiment with 2 inch Trench Mortar bomb filled with WHITE STAR GAS. I sent in a report to C.R.A. regarding the experiment. Lt.Pinder fired 4 rounds from Heavy gun in 1 1/2 hours excusing himself by saying it took a long while to get the gun into action and the telephone would not work. 
 2nd. Gave a short lecture to the officers on the WHITE STAR GAS and also mentioned discipline. 
 3rd. At 4.45am. after heavy artillery bombardment the 4th Australian Division (13 Bde) attacked Mouquet Farm as well as other points. The main attack was against Mouquet Farm. Mouquet Farm was occupied by us and the dug outs entered, they were found to have steel doors. It is quite uncertain how the position stands at present. Some say that our troops have been driven out, others that we have taken it again and holding onto it. Casualties heavy on our side. Went to WARLOY and obtained acetylene lamp. Canadians relieve 2nd Division.
