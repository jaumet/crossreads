Had a letter form Rita today & it has cheered me up wonderfully.Scrimgeour tonight promised to give me a recommendation when I leave, but no news of the result of the applications I put in a few days ago.Am progressing slowly with the Latin.Have come to the conclusion after a great deal of thought on the subject of late, that if I get back safely it will be urgently necessary for me to strike out in some new line & specialise in order to progress a little more quickly than I did.A little more application & diligence
