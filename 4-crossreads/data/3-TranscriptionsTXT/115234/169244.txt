 Come listen to me &amp; Ill 
 sing you a ditty 
 Of three little damsels 
 from London&#39;s fair City 
 To Codford they journeyed 
 air raids to escape 
 But rather I think 
 they came down on the make 
 ___________ &quot; __________ 
 Do they want us to lose 
 the war 
 Grim landladies sniffed 
 when apartments they sought 
 No thanks not for mine Ive 
 had enough of your sort 
 So sadly the girlies 
  bought  three tickets back  bought  
 Do they want us to lose 
 the war
