<p>13/7/17 Beaulencourt<br/>Another perfect sunny day with cooling breezes. Day devoted to drill in the morning and the necessary culling out of the contents of the packs preliminary to our move which takes place on the 24th. Paton comes here &amp; Watson goes to his Brigade almost tout de suite. Mixed programme in the morning including bayonet exercise to keep the blood lust going. After lunch a route march Villers au Flos &ndash; Reinecourt &ndash; about 4 miles and they were all out to it by the time we finished up. The day was warm and the men soft showing that we want much more of this before we can get up to the old standard. Indeed the standard will have to come down owing to the number of crocks we now have in the ranks. Old deformed chaps many of them &ndash; the flower has been weeded out of them. Conversed with Col. Craig and Leon Barbier during the evening. The old doc. looking very old and worn.</p>
