<p>1919<br/>May 12<br/>We were issued with two blankets each.  The sea was very calm, so the majority of the men decided to sleep on deck.  I slept on the boat deck.  About nightfall a thick fog came up which prevented the skipper from entering Southampton at night &ndash; which he wished to do.</p>
<p>May 13<br/>When it lifted in the morning we found ourselves anchored in the stream outside Southampton.  We reached the wharves about 9 am.  The Aquitania &ndash; at that time one of the largest boats afloat was just opposite us, also the Suevic, one of our troopships.  We had breakfast in a shed on the wharf provided by the Army &amp; Navy Canteen.  The train also, was waiting for us on the wharf, &amp; after breakfast  we got aboard.  The country was looking very dry, as there was a drought, ie &ndash; no rain had fallen for six weeks &ndash; terrible.  Anyhow the ground had begun to get big cracks in it like one sees in the back country, after a long dry summer. We reached Weymouth about dinner time, &amp; marched through the quaint old town</p>
