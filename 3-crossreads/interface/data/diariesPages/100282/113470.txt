Court Martial case.
Ceaseless bombing raids were the order of the day with our planes last night. Just one continuous stream of them going backwards forwards.
While Len was down on the Court Martial case this morning an "order" came round saying that he had to report at Battn Hqrs "full marching order" at 2' oclock for the purpose of proceeding to England to go on the Instructional Staff, you may guess how glad I was, for he will be practically safe for the duration, surely the war will be over by the time his six months up, so one of us will be sure to return, besides he has earned his spell he is taking a German rifle a lot of souvenirs of mine with him I gave him a few of my surplus francs to carry on with, we have always shared our money since being in the Army Len I are the best of pals I shall miss him greatly for a while Mr Traill did not like Len going in one way for he is a jolly good N.C.O.
