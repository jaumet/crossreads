  
 1918 Dec 18. by the way) On 18 December, my leg had apparently healed up, and I was marked "Convalescent Camp". As I was doing work for the Sister, she did not want to lose me, and decided to hold me till after Xmas, so she she held back my card. The very next day, my leg swelled up again, and broke out in the same place - evidently poisoned. Sister Soden used to attend to it, but I could not see the Doctor, as I was supposed to be in Le Havre. She had instructed me to duck out the back door as he came in the front ,but several times, I was within an ace of being caught. The Sister got me to go down to Abbeville twice to get her things. One of the lads wanted me to buy him a razor, and gave me 20 francs, but I thought I could get one easily for 12 &#126; 13 francs. They had some at 12 francs made of hoop iron, so I had to go the whole hog and pay 20 francs for a razor worth about 5/-. Dec 24 On the afternoon of 24 December some of the men in our ward were feeling pretty well
