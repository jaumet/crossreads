After getting rid of the pack I suddenly decide that I will have a run down to Littlehampton for I find that I can catch a train that will give me time to get there and back by 2.10 tomorrow so I sent a telegram off went down to the station taking all my souvenirs with me for I am going to leave them down there, am just in time to catch the train reach Littlehampton by 11.30.
