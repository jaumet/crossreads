10/11/17 near Ypres
A cold wet day very raw nipping. Mud dirt everywhere. Stayed indoors and read and wrote letters. Up the line the battalion is in support and is having a quiet time about 4 casualties up to date. Eitelberg, one of our originals, who was posted to the 23rd. was killed on reconnaisance. Today we had charcoal braziers for the first time. At dawn there was a hop over somewhere on our right and the big guns were active thumping away at distant targets. Our chaps have been doing good work in the way of bringing down Taubes or keeping them up at a respectable height by their bullet barrages. Some Australian mail came in today. A dirty life this after being on leave. Food covered in black smuts from charcoal fire served up by dirty unwashed servants. Really we have some villainous looking devils in the AW.
