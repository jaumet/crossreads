  
 Sat 15th June (cont.) At the Franco-American concert in evening.   Our "stalls" party included the two Mcs, George, & self.   Bob has a liver and grunted his refusal to come.   The audience was delightful - scarcely an Englishman there.   We aired our French - I deftly worked into the conversation sentences I had just looked up in "Connor's Phrase-Book".   The concert was an improvement of the English effort of a fortnight ago - or perhaps we are in a better mood.   The orchestra opened with a "Carmen" selection, a "Signorita" warbled, a "Mademoiselle" chansoned, two hopeless Yanks gave "Yaacka Hula" & "Chinatown".    We had a midnight picnic on the beach later - the four of us consuming much ersatz-lemonade & biscuits & having a concert on our own. 
 Sun. 15th June A most pathetic mass this morning for the sister of Lieut. Tellier - the girl was killed during an air-raid on Brussels last week.   The poor devil completely broke up at the close of Mass. 
 At vespers and rosary again in evening with the two Macs. (I'm getting quite devout recently, n'est-ca pas?)
