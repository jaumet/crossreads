  
 30 January 1918 Wednesday(X to X crossed out) Finer, but very cold only another month of Winter. Boils still bad under arm otherwise fit. X Rather sorry to hear from wife that No 14 A.G.H. is being moved to Port Said so she will have to go there. No immediate chance of me getting a Base job at present, but we are spelling for a month here yet & much may happen in the meantime. X Mails from England take much longer than mails from Australia at present. We see no Turks here  at present  but can hear the Artillery mainly.
