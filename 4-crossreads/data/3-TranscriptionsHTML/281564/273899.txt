<p>[Drawing of an alligator entitled "As we saw an alligator (art unalloyed")]</p>
<p>Monday 26th Oct<br/>Hoisted up the wireless pole.</p>
<p>Tuesday 27th Oct<br/>Went on outpost at the cross roads for a week with Cpl Clancy, Wakley, Hynes, Drummond, Tonkin &amp; Steer ("Dags" for short) The post is in a very beautiful spot where the road runs through a narrow fringe of cocoanut palms lying between a belt of massed swamp undergrowth &amp; the waters of the haven. On the other side are the many tinted stretches of the virgin forest &amp; arising into the mysterious clouds which ever hang their poisonous folds about them, are the blue coast ranges &ndash; the "on top" of the long shore Kanaka.</p>
<p>The spot though beautiful could by no means be called healthy for the waters of the swamp teem with mosquitoes which nightly ( &amp; daily) terrorise the inmates</p>
