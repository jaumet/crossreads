 21/9/15  This climate no good to me. Egypt for me &ndash; never in finer trim than while there and the hard training suited me. Dugouts unhealthy &ndash; cut out of clay and underground they are damp and like cellars and the damp can be seen up the walls. In winter they will be streaming with water the soakage of the hills round about; the water filtrating through graves. 
 22/9/15   Better, but still not too good. Atkinson 23rd killed. Ellerton went mad when two men killed one on each side &ndash; quite insane now. This is no place for the highly strung man. Lone Pine a hot spot among bombs but we head the casualties here in this section owing to artillery getting to us. Only separated from Abdul by a steel plate with two loopholes in it at Pine. On Field Court Martial at Brown's Dip all afternoon, returning with another officer got lost in the maze of trenches and came out again exactly where we started from! This in broad daylight. San Macindoe Foote still in Egypt with a sore finger. Turned in early and had a good rest &ndash; should have been most annoyed had Abdul attacked. 
 23/9/15   Up at stand to &ndash; for an hour in future The coldest morning yet with a wind like ice. Sea very pretty, all flecked with white horses. Shrapnel whizzing very close here this morning probably guns a long distance off with consequent very steep angle of descent. Went down to niche in hill and stood there watching our shells bursting on enemies trenches at right angles to us. No bad shots every one bursting in their trenches. Watched there until "moved on" by their snipers bullets
