<p>4th D.A.H.Q.<br/>30-1-1918</p>
<p>Dear Vernon,</p>
<p>In going through some old files of mine I came across the attached notes issued to the Battery Commanders of my old command, &amp; have sent a copy on to you hoping they be of possible assistance should you or your Section Commanders have the opportunity or need for a quiet "talk" to your young officers.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>W.L.H. Burgess.</p>
<p>(Lt. Morris File herewith also.)<br/>WLHB</p>
<p>[William Livingstone Hatchwell Burgess, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.  In 1914 Burgess was promoted to Captain and then Major.  In 1916 he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and in 1917 to Brigadier General of the Royal Artillery 4th Division, a post he held until the end of the war. He was described by General W.R. Birdwood in a letter dated 17 March 1919, as being of "exceptional ability and character."]</p>
