<p>we saw Bill Fitch sitting against a concrete wall for safety and he said as we passed, "Where are you going", We said, "up Forward", and he said "Youre Stiff", shortly afterwards a shell landed right on the wall and we never saw poor old Bill after. He was put down as missing but he was killed, blown to bits.</p>
<p>When we gained the top of the Ridge Bill Morris stopped and looked, and then said "How we are going to get through that I dont know". We stood along side of him and looked at Glencorse wood. It was simply one sea of bursting shells and we had to go through to find C.H.Q. or get lost.</p>
<p>I will say Bill Morris was one of the gamest men ever walked and he just said, "Come on", and away we went. We were all loaded up with gear but I never felt it and at times I could just see the others ahead</p>
