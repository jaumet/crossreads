<p>16/9/18 Cappy</p>
<p>It was a beautiful fine day. We marched to Divnl Sports near Eclusier and they proved a great turnout. The tote and Tatts-sur-Somme were busy &ndash; a crowd of gamblers. The great event of the day was the Band Competition well won by 4th Battalion We crashed on the music - being first the men were nervous and had no wind. There were some fine bands here. The 21st were second. Some nurses arrived and Birdwood Monash &amp; Rosenthal were also there. Fell in with and yarned to some of the former and then drifted on to some of the latter. Some good fancy costumes. A lovely view from here today over the surrounding country. Returned to camp about 8 after a day full of varied experiences and very enjoyable.</p>
