 16th. Have been skating again this afternoon got on real well had only 1 buster the whole time, & while there this afternoon I bought a pair of splendid skates a chap sold them to me for 12/- they are  Wilcoxs  "Winslows" make and a pair of beauties they are too fast at present if anything for me they run like greased lightning seems funny don't it being in hospital & yet able to go skating like fun, the old chap who looks after the skates at the rink knows me alright, calls me the mad Sgt.
