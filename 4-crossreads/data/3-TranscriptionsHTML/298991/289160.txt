<p>Saturday April 21st<br/>Very quiet. Fine day. The food problem in England is getting very bad, pretty near in every line. We have been cut down the half slice of bread for dinner, that is the only way it has affected us.</p>
<p>Sunday April 22nd<br/>A lovely day. Put in for a "walking out pass" with another fellow here this morning. Got pass from 1 pm till 7.30 pm. We decided to go to Norwich, which is about 3 miles away. We walked about a mile, then we hired a rowing boat (cost us 2/- for the afternoon), rowed right into Norwich via river, tied our boat up &amp; had a good time in the town, it is a pretty big place. My word there are a terrible lot of girls there, &amp; with the hospital suit on &amp; blue band on your arm, <strike>you</strike> we got a good reception where ever we went. We rowed back via river, &amp; got back to Hospital about 6.30 pm very tired, but both declaring we had had a very good afternoon.</p>
<p>Monday April 23rd<br/>A fine day, as we are to go away to the Australian hospital tomorrow, we had to draw our kit this evening, &amp; after a lot of waiting &amp; humbugging about we eventually got it. One of the nurses pressed my tunic for me. Feeling very crook this evening. Of course the usual row &amp; tricks went on tonight, as when there is anyone going away..</p>
