<p>train which left about half an hour late the first train being full of officers.   Had a snack at the station, tea &amp; bun our last being a sandwich at the Canteen in Boulogne.   Reached London shortly after two oclock &amp; marched to Horseferry road where refreshments awaited us and splendid treatment otherwise, quite different to my previous experience.   In fact "going on leave" is now a glorified Cooks Tour whereas before it was worse than a nightmare.   Left my spare gear in the Pack Store &amp; swapped my old hat for a new one in the clothing store, did not worry about my other gear as I had a good Uniform at Dartford.   We then took taxi to the National Hotel where I had a bath &amp; clean change &amp; then booked seats at the Haymarket to see "General Post" a first rate show with a war interest.   Had dinner at the Hotel &amp; turned in well satisfied after a yarn with an Aussie.</p>
