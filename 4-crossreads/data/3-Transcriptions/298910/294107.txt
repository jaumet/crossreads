<p>The Whole Ambulance was supposed to move forward some three miles &amp; open up a Main Dressing Station &ndash; the order seemed to be cancelled later &ndash; or perhaps our gains are not as great as anticipated. Wounded men tell us that the 10th Batt men are in Bapaume &ndash; practically no resistance? &ndash; supposed gains along the line are from 1,000 yds to 5 miles. Got a batch of 50 reinforcements.</p>
<p>Monday  26/2/17</p>
<p>Quite night &ndash; Slight rain &ndash; Fine day mostly &ndash; Planes &amp; Balloons up in the evening &ndash; All reinforcements sent on to relieve posts &ndash; Poor devils were nearly scared to death at the prevailing conditions &amp; Fritzs barrages. Fairly busy &ndash; Very heavy Artillery firing throughout the night &ndash; expect good news after it. Nothing official of our gains yet.</p>
<p>Tuesday  27/2/17</p>
<p>Dull day &ndash; fairly warm &amp; dry &ndash; Got news that Bapaume is not in our hands yet, but have taken the Villages of Pys &ndash; Serre &amp; Miraumont</p>
