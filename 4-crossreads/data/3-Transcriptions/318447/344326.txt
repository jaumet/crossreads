<p>Nov 16th<br/>Outside Jaffa.</p>
<p>The last two days have been very quiet, we did not get woken up by shells after all, as the Turks departed in the night.</p>
<p>We stayed most of the next day at Deiran eating up big on the wheaten loaves of bread which we bought there, &amp; then came on to Ramleh which is a large but very dirty town with only one or two large buildings in it. We passed through that</p>
