<p>Saturday 15 September 1917<br/>The day has come!  Left home 8.45 a.m. &amp; when shall I see them all again.<br/>Boarded the Ayrshire 10 a.m., parade in saloon, roll called &amp; payment made where asked for.  Mine not taken.  Sisters 27 in all, happy looking &amp; bright.  Dr. Barry &amp; Mr. Rev. Birch, Sister Ralston in charge.<br/>Draw lots for births [berths], mine 16 port hole.  Took snaps of both Heads as we left &amp; a final view of "our beautiful".  Under weigh 11.30 a.m.<br/>By 1 p.m. dear Sydney's shores had faded and except for a dimming coast line all day nothing but sparkling blue sea with scarcely a roll round us.  No trace of seasickness for Florence.  So ends first day.</p>
