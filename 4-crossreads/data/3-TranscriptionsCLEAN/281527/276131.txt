 Went over to Quesques and saw the dentist Pottinger. The day was a lovely one and there was a good frost. All the roads were hard and ice was on the ponds but the sky was clear and cloudless and we had bright sun. Rode to Colonel Brazenor and others who were inspecting high ground suitable for a training area. The land here is moorland and from the top of the ridge there is an extensive sweeping view for many miles. A great basin full of snug villages and farms formed a splendid and memorable sight as everything was bathed in golden sunlight. We rode back then and I lunched with Brazenor at his billet and then we both went back to Bde.H.Q where I handed over commission of the Brigade to him. It was such a fine afternoon
