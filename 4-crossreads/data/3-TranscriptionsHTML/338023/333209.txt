<p>One is an epileptic, another was found to be not all there &amp; guilty of bad habits. Fancy sticking such men into the cook-house, simply because they're no good as fighters! Our own special cook is a chap who never cooked an egg in his life &amp; did not know how to cook spuds before he enlisted. He's proud of the fact &amp; reckons that if the war lasts ten years he may, in that time, learn to boil mutton. He gave us some the other day garnished with onions which had been fermenting for a week or so in wet bags. When the orderly officer came round, he found the mob, armed with sticks, surrounding a big stake to which the dixie was chained &amp; fixed with a padlock. When he roared they just explained that the thing was wild &amp; they'd fixed it so it wouldn't bite him. He crimed the lot for "disrespect" &amp; we had no breakfast. These jokes are funny afterwards, but one feels up to any sort of devilment at the time.</p>
<p>Am enclosing a photo (?) of the "The Knuts". By the way, did you see Kerrys about the ones I had taken? I left the receipt with Mother. If they're any good I could do with a couple of Post Cards here, as Lois will be sure to ask for one &amp; Bill Simpson, who is "out" through an accident, has asked for one to take back to Brisbane.  Bill is all white &amp; the Knuts are sorry to lose him. He was the head comedian of the company here &amp; Addison Rd.</p>
