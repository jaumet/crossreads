<p>July 19<br/>272.<br/>A day of general successes, the 9th Div. &ndash; and the S.A.s leading attacked and won Meteren &ndash; capturing 7 officers and 259 O.R.  Our Left Brigade quick to follow, and joining the S.A.'s won to their credit, 90 prisoners, 10 M.G. and M.W.  And from the Aisne-Marne Front, still word comes of the French advancing and official capture of 6 last night over 14000 prisoners &amp; 200 guns.  Midday's rumour brought the prisoner tally to 17000, and tonight to 22000.  But since the confirming to last night, no wire has arrived to the present.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the S.A.s Pool, the yarning was of possible "Blighties" on the taking of Meteren:  it was the stunt they were drawn for during their last turn in, but unfavourable winds and weather had held the attack, they went in yesterday, and their stunt was today.  My hope above all is that 'Sandy' will come out when they are relieved.</p>
<p>Our casualties for the day below thirty.</p>
<p>July 19<br/>273.<br/>Mail &ndash; from T.B.C., M.T.H. Sadler's "The Anchor" &ndash; a continuing of the Portrait of Laddy McAllister &ndash; the continuing from "Hyssop".</p>
<p>Down from Liverpool in 1915 &ndash; Hyssop I bought at Dymocks, and read in the night at home on leave:  and I placed it with McKenzie's "Sinister St." that I'd read earlier in the year.  I'm hungry to read it through &ndash; but must ration it to last to the arriving of Hauptmann's Vol. 1 of Plays, or the return to George from Eric G. of "The Way of all Flesh".</p>
<p>Interrogated Boche tell of no offensive &ndash; then of the day of their travail the 24.  But I'll back our side, and the Frenchman Foch.</p>
<p>274.<br/>Commences today a fourth <strike>day</strike> year of wasted days.  But I've seen beauty in Egypt, in France and in England and the greater beauty of our Island's men.</p>
<p>Four tonight of the 1st Batt. &ndash; I met them on the rail by the fields, and left them with a memory ful of the Gods of Australia.</p>
