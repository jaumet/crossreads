was such a dear old thing. 
Our worthy Sec. Payney has arranged a soccer game with the Welsh Fusilies, who arrived
23.
March 1916.
Yesterday and are camped near us so we are looking forward to an interesting match.
Sunday 19th
Church Parade, all of the 8th Brigade with the exception of the gallant F.Amb. paraded in their helmets and colours. Our helmets have been in the SM. Store for about a fortnight but they are keeping them for the flies to blow before issuing, as they do everything. The soccer match came off this afternoon and the Royal Welse Fusiliers were beaten, 2 goals to 0 Ben Harris, the cook of A. Section, scored both. I wrote a long letter to Lill using the new green envelope for the first time. Also sent a field Service card to Mother and one to Kath. We dug a trench round our tent to-day, as it rained very heavily last night and almost washed us out. Bill Lancaster, Payne and I missed Church parade as all our clothes were wet.
Monday 20th 
Stretcher drill, jolly warm work. Water cart in use at last. 79 horses and 30 or 40 men in the transport, yet the poor cooks fatigue have had to cart water.
Tuesday 21st
On Cooks fatigue. It's not a bad job now the water fatigue is cut out and A. Section were inoculated on Monday and our turn comes again tomorrow. One good job, it does ot have so much effect as the last lot.
Wednesday 22nd
Innoculated again, by the time they have finished innoculating, we ought to be immune from every bloomin? disease under the sun. They issued our crowd with helmets to-day, but they didn't have one big enough for me, so I've got to wait.
