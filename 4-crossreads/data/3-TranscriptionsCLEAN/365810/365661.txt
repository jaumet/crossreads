Amongst the people at Monte Carlo were Marian Crawford, son of the author, a Baron Leman, ex-consul general for Holland in Greece, Constantinople and Salonika.  His American wife who was with the red cross throughout the first Balkan War.  The Playles who were through the San Francisco earthquake.  An English ex-consul general in Italy & his family & the Williamsons, authors.  They were all most kind & hospitable to us.
With kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson & yourself & best wishes for a happy Christmas.
Yours affectionatelyWalter MacCallum
