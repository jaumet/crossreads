paring to fire the next salvo, tells me that there is no hurry.  And

and just before the shot should reach its mark some wonderful
machine sounds a hooter in the foretop at which everybody directs
his glasses at the target just in time to see eight geysers rise up

fired I was drinking tea with the Gunnery Commander in his cabin -
his work was over, it was the duty of someone else to take the ship
back to harbour.
     On another occasion we were out for a bit of work in
repelling night attacks of submarines and other torpedo craft.

at their work both in conjunction with the battle squadrons and at
their own evolutions and I must say that to a layman like myself
the work of the destroyers possesses more thrills than that of the
