<p>Gallipoli Peninsular<br/>Feb. 16th 1919</p>
<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>We are at last under canvas having moved over from Chanak to Kilid Bahr spending an afternoon and night at a Turkish Hospital camp, now occupied by the French.  We moved on yesterday with the full marching outfit mule teams <strike>in</strike> and limbers, pack mule, chargers &amp; the whole issue;  quite a picturesque little lot and we are now camped on ground <strike>on</strike> occupied by the Turk during the operations.  It was a great disappointment to learn that the 7th L.H. and the Canterburys had returned to Palestine, but fortunately there are two L.H. officers still left with a small unit engaged in grave registration &amp; photography &amp; they are doing everything in their power to assist us, so that in a few days we shall be properly fixed.</p>
<p>While camp was being established yesterday afternoon I rode with Bean &amp; Wilkins over the Turkish trenches across no mans &amp; along the front of ours, &amp; one gets the situation at a glance.  At one place only about 30 yards between the opposing jacko &amp; us,</p>
