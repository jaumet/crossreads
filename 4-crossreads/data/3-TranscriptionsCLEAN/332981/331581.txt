  
 Several brought petrol tins & were filled with hot water & the tins put in on the fire & boiled up in a few minutes. We had to answer all sorts of questions about what time the train will arrive in Calais, & what is delaying us & so on, an answer was given to each. As my time was up at 9 am I was relieved about 3 miles from Charlerio, I turned in to bed at 10 am still outside & had a good sleep. On waking up at 7 pm I found that we were at Mons, we were to pick up another train of Belgian civilians for Arras but being so late, we missed them, we lost the leave train at Charleroi owing to having to go back to Montignai for coal. 
 After leaving Mons very slow progress was made all along & being relieved after being on again all night, I was asleep when passing through Somani & along to Arras, we were delayed some time in Arras, having to wait several passenger trains to pass. 
 The town of Arras from the station is very much knocked about & in an awful condition, also the country from Somani to Arras is a wilderness,
