Sund. 3rd Feb. 1918The following extract taken from an article in "Aussie", the new A.I.F. paper, shows so clearly the difference between Paris & London that I am quoting it in full:-
"Paris is magnetic - electric.  It thrills.  London impresses the visitor by its immensity, the density of its crowds, its complexity, its stolid commercial air;  its beauty, its art, its lighter side must be sought.  But from the first glimpse of Paris one is strongly influenced by its beauty, its vivacity, its spirit of camaraderie.  Immense, commercial London interests & bewilders.  Pleasure loving, artistic Paris charms & elates."
