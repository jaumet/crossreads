  
 May, 1915 Monday 3 Just received long letter from Daisy dated 28 March & yours of April 4 with Grazier & Australasian, so glad to hear all is well at home - I posted more snapshots - some of myself, hair cut a la jail bird & moustache you can hardly recognize. Went Heliopolis where all our wounded are from - Sister Myra Nyse also there poor girl 13 weeks in bed from Pneumonia. You will have news in Australia of Casualties long before we see the correct list -
