 342 The only chap I met this stint I knew before was Dooli Banks.  He was one of the party come down to inspect the new constructing Medical Dugout, to the N. of Flers.  Just the same old Dooli, the Serj., a bit taller and a typical Australian &ndash; slight look sheepskin &ndash; but he"d stuck to his old felt &ndash; damn the shrapnell. 
 343  Dec. 17 Duty now on evacuation staff.  24 hour shifts.  First 12 hours about half a dozen cases, last about 30 cases &ndash; to be taken down from line to railhead for C.C.S. &ndash; through mud, slush, over a light rail, and mud, slush again. 
 344 Yesterday during the early day read essay of R. Louis" [Stevenson], "Some Aspects of Robert Burns &ndash; a fascinating study and finely written.  Another incarnation of Jake"s &ndash; Robert Burns.  As Stevenson writes of Burns so I should want to write of Jake. 
 Dear old Jake, to you I owe more than to any other chap I"ve yet met &ndash; and to him by his influence my being in the 1st Field. 
 But Jake &ndash; now more than ever before do I realise how absurd it would have been for me to aspire  with you to the O.T.C.  To take the interest necessary for a commission in range, shell fire bombs.  Somehow it is more than I could ever manage.  Yesterday we were yarning round a brazier with one of our auxiliary men from Flers and the unaffected interest Syd took in the conversation fascinated me. 
 345 Heard yesterday that Bob Smith had applied for transfer to A.S.C. &ndash; then that he"d some time ago lost his leg.  Bob was one of those physically beautiful types &ndash; a symphony of the surf &ndash; cleanly proportioned as a bronze of Prometheus [?] a stern and nutty brown body. 
 346 Tonight letter form Mother, and amongst others one from Clair.  Here"s an extract from hers &ndash; following an account of her brother being killed at Pozieres &ndash; "C.J." has been awfully good to me, he has done all in his power to cheer me up and help me to forget my sorrow, he has a new motor bike and is getting a side car &ndash; then you will hear some thrilling accounts of our trips, especially if it breaks down in the middle of the bush and I have to get out and push. 
 347  19 Dec. Field yarns and tales, on the boys return will be dull and colourless without the enlightening bloodies, etc. &ndash; colourless that is beside the Aristophanean accounts of encounters and episodes that are the daily subjects in the huts and dugouts. 
 348 Today Syd went down to the Rest Camp at Buire and brought back with him parcels for the half section &ndash; and then for me one from Mat with John Oxenham"s "Bess in Amber" and one from Mother with a seaman"s cap &ndash; from Paris and Australia and one of gold from Merridens &ndash; three books &ndash; The Private Papers of Harry Rycroft, Vanity Fair and The Egoist, and I was so bankrupt in literature that I was painfully wading through David Copperfield &ndash; 533 pages of close type. 
 Thus now I stand after 3 small parcels.  A Gold sovereign, a book, and 3 pairs of sox.  To the high Gods, to Mother, Mother and Merridens high thanks.  And I"m forgetting two letters, one from Elsie again &ndash; on card &ndash; and one from Jake. 
 349  Dec. 20 There"s an old grey horse behind just this side of the temporary prisoners compound &ndash; 200 yds. above us.  Fritz has been shelling us since early this morning and the horse is still standing there, now with his ears [indecipherable] back a still as a statue, now straining at his tether, and not windy whizz, back with a horrible jerk up his head. 
 350 Today, in place of the theory, the practice of building.
