<p>The airservice absolutely delights our chaps now it being so decisively in the ascendant.  Rain late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Sunday 21st July<br/>Made up requisition for weekly supply of drugs.  Very quiet.</p>
<p>Monday 22nd July<br/>Collected drugs at Crouy.  Took the Q.M. W.O. with me &amp; made a day of it by going to Dados as well.  Had great difficulty in getting dinner at Picquigny<br/>owing to the new French rationing scheme.  At last we met an old dame enamoured of the Aussies because of our work on the Somme &amp; she made a special effort &amp; gave us 3 eggs potatoes &amp; peas for 2.75  Arrived back at 4 oclock &amp; a splitting headache.  Whilst away the huns had brought one of our balloons down &amp; we brought two of his down.</p>
<p>Tuesday 23rd July<br/>Wet nearly all day.  Issued supplies all day.  Air service quiet.</p>
<p>Wednesday 24th<br/>Quiet &amp; rain.  Nothing doing.  Rather an important event in the history of the unit was the arrival of our 1st Yanks.  36 of them belonging to the 129th</p>
