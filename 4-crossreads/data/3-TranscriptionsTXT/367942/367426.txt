The proper name of the camp we don't know but I believe it is not Fuchsberg.23rd AprilWe are still waiting arrival of the Kommandant, two officers have arrived but they know nothing or say they don't.30th April7A.M. Marched out of Nethermore to station raining & blowing. Noon Had a meal at Hanover. 10pm. Arrived at Clausthal Camp starting to snow & bitterly cold. Officers had an excellent meal awaiting us, first since leaving Heidelberg.Clausthal was in pre-war times The Peacock Hydro, the rooms in the main building are fine but of course we were put in the huts, six in a room, not bad, but bitterly cold & no fires.1st MayWoke up to find everything covered with snow, which gradually melted during the day. This place is right up in the Hertz Mountains about 2500 feet high & most of the time covered with mist. The outlook when clear is beautiful. The camp overlooks a lake with hills & woods beyond, making a pretty picture.
