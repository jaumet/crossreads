<p>December 1917<br/>Monday 3<br/>Still at Enab &ndash; Turks shelled road and dump. I had narrow escape going to water shell passed very close and burst 10 yds behind me. No damage<br/>Nothing doing, very cold north wind.</p>
<p>Tuesday 4<br/>Went from Enab to Regt with despatches expecting to get parcels but was disappointed. Regt camped on nice spot 9 miles back near village of Artuf.<br/>We have fire every night and Tommies and Scotchmen flock round and yarn over past experiences. Londoners very humorous, Surprised at us pinching wood and cutting olive trees.</p>
