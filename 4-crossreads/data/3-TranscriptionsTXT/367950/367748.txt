We could have gone on as most of us had sufficient rations for at least 24 hours but the horse feed was the trouble so we were unavoidably delayed and consequently reached Maghdaba several hours after sunrise  daylight. The Turks got wind of our approach about 7 a m and Von Krasse or Krans promptly bolted so we missed the biggest fish of the lot. Maleesh. We will catch Von "Iron Cross" yet. A Turkish Doctor we captured told us that it was the happiest day of his life he said that there was a great deal of internal trouble amongst the Turkish forces themselves and the Germans and Austrians and there was no money and supplies were difficult to obtain and transport.A significant fact which I noticed the other day was that although the Turks fought gallantly - up to a certain point - and then had a white flag handy to hoist. That white flag was always handy they had it with them.
