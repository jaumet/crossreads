<p>1915<br/>June 20 Sun.<br/>A big school at Giza (Saidieh School) has been converted into a Red Cross Military Hospital &amp; is being run by civil voluntary aid. I had a look over the Hospital this afternoon.<br/>Suddenly received 100 fresh patients to-night &ndash; First for a fortnight &ndash; our hopes of getting away from Egypt dashed to the ground &ndash; Hurrah! They are only to stay for the night &amp; to-morrow &ndash; Now even more hope of getting away from the land of the Pharoahs.</p>
