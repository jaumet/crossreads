  
 13 - us huts for the winter. As long as my tent stands the winds & blizzards I'd just as soon have them. They say Kitchener was through here in a motor yesterday - but I was in bed and did not see him. I believe this new General Munro wont move without a much bigger number of men. I suppose the war lord has come out to see what can be done. This is I know a very boring letter. I'll tell you what I did today, just to give you a detailed account of my life here. I went off duty at 7.30 am. The morning was grey - the harbour beautiful like glass with its extraordinary variety of shipping - lying quiet in the wonderful grey tints. Anxious captains were bringing transports in once more to harbour and safety. Hospital ships everywhere - the rest I must not mention - we are on a sort of peninsula and I see the harbour both sides as I walk down our main street to our lines. My orderlies walking up and down to & from the quartermasters stores and carrying water to their wards. Day sisters coming on duty - all now so familiar a scene. I leave my coat etc in my tent and go to see Capt Lloyd who is asleep - and has had a fair night -
