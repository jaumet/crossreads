8/1/18 Taunton Bath
a fine view of the whole of the valley of Taunton Deane backed by the Quantock Hills on top of which a Wellington Monument is prominent. In the valley is the town with three square towered churches not unlike that at Roque . Between ? a land of hedges and little farms. This must be a great sight in springtime. Embowered in the wood on the side of the hill is one of the "stately homes of England". Followed the road round right back into Taunton and had a lunch before catching the train for Bath. The railway skirts the coast after leaving Taunton and we found ourselves in land lightly snowcovered. Entering Bristol there is a gorge with prominent suspension bridge and from the train can be had a good birds eye view of the city. Landed at
