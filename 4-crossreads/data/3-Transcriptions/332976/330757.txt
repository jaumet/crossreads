<p>November 1916<br/>27th   We had a very heavy frost last night &amp; the water is covered with ice.  About 10 A.M. the sun came out &amp; the weather has changed again.  Large quantities of Cupolas for dugouts arrived here to-day &amp; are being taken out to the supports to-night.  This afternoon about 3 o'clock we witnessed the sad plight of one of our own planes.  He caught fire in a duel &amp; was forced to decend.  The pilot handled his machine magnificently but hit ground about two hundred yds from us very hard &amp; destroyed the machine.  The [pilot] was killed himself but the observer escaped injury.</p>
