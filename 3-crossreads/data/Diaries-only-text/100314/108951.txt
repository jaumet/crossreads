father. Held Orderly Room where there was a rather deplorable case of a man deserting through nerves ? something the Army takes no account of. Walked down to BdeH.Q. and there saw the General who discussed the projected stunt out an event re which the utmost secrecy is being observed and yet my own men have been discussing it for days!. Returning, our archies were potting away at an odd enemy craft overhead. Saw James and with him discussed the latest ?developments of the tactical situation? and then had tea with Braithwaite Coy. Went down into the Catacombes and talked with the men. They are wonderful take them all round. These chaps undergo things in the way of discomfort that make me have a great admiration for them.
