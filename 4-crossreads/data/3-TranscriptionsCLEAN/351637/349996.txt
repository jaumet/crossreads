  
 of bringing the war to a successful conclusion by gradually wearing down Germany's colossal military power. I have taken the liberty of writing very fully because I have no means of knowing how far the real truth of the situation is known in England and how much the Military Authorities disclose.  I thought therefore that perhaps the opinions of an independent observer might be of value to you at the present juncture.  I am of course breaking the censorship regulations by sending this letter through but I have not the slightest hesitation in doing so as I feel it is absolutely essential for you to know the truth. I have been requested over and over again by officers of all ranks to go home and personally disclose the truth but it is difficult for me to leave until the beginning of October. 
 Hoping you will therefore excuse the liberty I have taken.     Believe me     Yours very truly     E. Ashmead Bartlet     The Rt. Hon. H.S.Asquith      10 Downing Street.
