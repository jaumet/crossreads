"D" Camp Mametz
1/4/17
Fell in at 9 and marched down to Becourt for church parade and presentation of medals and ribbons by General Birdwood. The men all clean and looking well dressed in greatcoats and drill order hats. Gas helmets slung over everything and hanging at the left side. Marched along sloppy roads until we reached some high ground near Becourt. Passed many Hun prisoners on the roads doing fatigue work. 
The Battn formed up in mass and we soon had a Brigade square with about 2600 men on parade. A good view in all directions. Albert's fallen statue and trees and untouched ground on slopes in rear. General Birdwood and staff came on parade and service proceeded. Rather interrupted by the curiosity of a flying squadron the noise of which quite drowned the preacher's voice as they circled overhead. After service Military Medals and ribbons were presented to the men who had won them. General Birdwood made an address and gave the latest war news. Marched home to camp again. Battalion officers mess now
