  
 my lover but please don't think that it troubles me much, my life is full of interest   &  I get lots of fun   &  enjoyment out of it. One thing I shall not think of ever settling down to a Darby   &  Joan existence. What say you? I'm afraid you won't know your daughter Edith when she returns, she looks on life quite differently to a few years ago. 
 Am getting very aged - Oh me. Well, am afraid there is no news to tell   &  it is dinner time so Hope you all had a Happy New Year   &  we shall all be together next Year. 
 Fondest love   &  kisses From Yours lovingly Edith 
 Love   &  kisses for Eddy
