  
 at hand were cup, two plates, a mop & sheet.  We succeeded however and since most of the orderlies were sea sick we were detailed to work until midnight as relief. After dark did not feel so well. Sighted Kangaroo Island about dusk (South Australia). 
 Thursday 4th Awoke with a feeling of sickness but ate breakfast and during morning improved rapidly.  As day wore on the sea became calmer and the seasick men became better. 
 Friday 5th Sea quite calm again & felt very fit.  Food of late has been very good including haricot beans, peas, fig pudding, cinnamon pudding, etc. 
 Saturday 6th Tom Trollope not too good probably influenza.  Was placed in hospital at night. Had two short spells of physical drill. Yesterday passed another troopship A.66 close enough to hear whistle of men. For 24 hours ended noon today we did 317 miles & for previous 24 hours we did 296 miles. Have been in the Bight for that period so the weather has not been too bad. Threw overboard a bottle containing address etc. 
 Cancelled.
