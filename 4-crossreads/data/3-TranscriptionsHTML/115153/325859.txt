<p>German Plane shot the pilot of the British Plane in the wrist, the consequence of which forced the British Airman to descend.

Crowds of soldiers, who were camped nearby, rushed to the assistance of the men and soon extricated them, and stopped the engine which was still driving the broken propeller.</p>
<p>After we had been in Scotts Redoubt about a week, we moved on to Cinque Ports Camp which was situated about one mile nearer the trenches again. This camp was adjacent to a railway siding where a large quantities of war material was stored, and consequently we were shelled fairly frequently during our stay of about 5 days.
