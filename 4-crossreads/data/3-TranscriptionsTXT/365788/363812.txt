 We will have to have another Christmas when I come back I am too far away. Please kiss your two dear daughters &amp; the fine son for their loving Uncle. We get plenty of Tobacco issued to us &amp; some Cigarettes. Lately I have given up pipe smoking &amp; taken to Cigarettes only. Very much love to you all &amp; with best wishes for a Merry Xmas &amp; a Bright New Year. Your ever loving brother Fred
