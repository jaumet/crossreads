advise him to go by lorry, the more I tried the more determined he became to tramp it, so I eventually agreed with him, that walking was after all the one exercise that we required.)
The distance was about fifteen miles, but had it been fifty it would have been just the same, we should have walked it.  A more determined or stubborn fellow I never came across, but at the same time a better chap never walked.- (unless he had to)_ -.!!
On passing the guards which were placed on the frontier of France and Belgium we experienced no difficulty as the "turned up hat" was at once recognised and no questions asked.  We were allowed to pass without being challenged.  There were two Belgian and two French soldiers on guard at these points whose duty it was to see the passports of anyone passing over the frontiers.  It was hardly likely that many would be going the way we were unless obliged to do so.  It certainly would not be on a pleasure trip!!
We passed through Poperinghe on our way and stayed there and had a decent feed, and duly arrived at our destination early in the evening
KRUISSTRATT.
Ye gods! what a place (if it ever had been one), nothing but ruins everywhere.  Struck me at once as being a pretty hot place, and as things proved, I was not very far from wrong.
Adjoining Ypres, in fact a portion of the place, it seemed to be a kind of storage depot for shells and bombs after completing the job they had been sent over for by the enemy.  I had heard bombs fall before this time, but for the consistency and painful regularity commend me to this place.  Shells were continuous, and bombs at night, ceaseless.
We occupied a position on the main street, in a portion of a ruined house, the covering being just a sheet of galvanised iron.  This was our office and sleeping quarters.  All round were horse-lines, and the enemy was ever trying to reduce this means of transport, so that at night we had anything but a cheerful time.
