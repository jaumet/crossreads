However I reached the Batt. it was not so bad as I thought it would be for the boys welcomed me back heartily. I am not skiting when I say that they think a fair bit of me for I have always acted as fairly squarely to all sides as it was possible for me to do I am sure I have very few enemies. I reported at once to our "orderly room" here I saw the Colonel Major they were surprised to see me, they knew nothing whatever of us being recalled, however the Colonel said he would make a note of it.
