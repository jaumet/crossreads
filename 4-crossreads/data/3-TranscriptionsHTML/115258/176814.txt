<p>I am sending you the photo Bill &amp; I had taken in Jaffa. The chaps reckon that its not bad considering. You see we both had headaches and wanted a cup of tea and we had to keep our hats on because our hair had not been brushed for about a month etc. I am also sending you to-day a registered envelope with 15 films in it and my last years diary. A chap has just come and said that an Australia mail would be in to-morrow. I hope its true. I was very cloudy up in the mountains round Jerusalem so I could not take many photos, but I bought a big book of photos in Jerusalem and will sent it home to you as soon as I can get something to wrap it in. I will go over to the Y.M.C.A. now and see if they have any card board. Love to Father and the boys&nbsp; yourself Mother. I am Your loving son Robert C. Wilson</p>
<p>P.S. I am also sending you an envelope of cards that the monks gave me on the Mount of Temptation also a photo o Jim Ayre.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Took my diary up to Mr Tomlins to be censored and he would not let me send it saying he can get it home much safer by sending it to his sister and getting her to sent it home by some returning chap from the 14th. Its jolly good of him and I&#39;ll do that</p>
<p>P.P.P.S. In the registered envelope</p>
