 I tripped or caught my foot in some broken &quot;duckboard&quot;, and fell, hoped that on rising I should discover that I had at least sprained an ankle or broken a leg, but the fates I imagined were against me, nothing happened. I still continued to feel well and strong, and quite able to carry on the good work. How I envied those fellows who were being wounded not very badly, but just enough to get them to &quot;Blighty&quot;. But I, wish as I would, always bobbed up bright and smiling, and do what I might, nothing happened to get me out of it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; They say that everyone has some form of madness, my special lunacy took the form of cold water. I must have cold&nbsp;water. No! oh no! not for drinking purposes, I never did and I don&#39;t think I ever shall be an adocate for &quot;water drinking&quot; (unless it is diluted), I certainly am of the opinion that cold water is necessary for the healthy upbringing of plants of all kinds, but as a drink solely, for human consumption, it is a failure, it produces no vim, it has no &quot;bite&quot; it has neither a pleasing taste nor an exhilarating effect.

Yes! I&#39;m afraid as a drink by itself, water is a &quot;wash-out&quot;. For cleansing artlcles, for garden purposes, or for travelling on, water is good. It&#39;s a mighty good thing for us that water occupied so much space, between Australia and England, or I suppose we should have had to &quot;route march&quot; the distance by stages.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; No! my lunacy took the form of cold water for bath purposes. I have always, during and since my early boyhood, had a cold bath (or failing
