13.6.15Sun. 13th.  Church Service was held this morning here in the gully.  Stan & I were too busy writing to attend.  The warships have been firing pretty constant all day.  About dinner time a Turkish gun picked up the range of the New Zealand observation post on the hill right over us & dropped "lydite" shells onto it, & the trenches in the vicinity with monotonous regularity, throwing sand bags & earth in all directions.  We are within 200 yds. of where the shells were dropping & got a fine view of the proceedings from our dug-out & we were quite close enough for observation purposes.  I generally have to fight our acting Q.M. Sergeant when drawing rations before getting our full allowance & I am that used to it now I feel disappointed when I cannot find something to raise an argument on.
