 23 April 1918 Tuesday (Whole page crossed out) Yesterday sent most of Troops away to J- &amp; I rejoin my Regiment today- very hot in J. Valley &amp; am disappointed about leave &amp; poor Dolly too still it cannot go on for ever &amp; she must be a brave soldier's wife. I think our Brigade are coming out of the front line for a rest so may get away then- All my love to you at Home.  F.W. Always glad to read Diary it is a record when printed for me too.
