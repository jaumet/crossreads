 The Bedouins are reaping their corn all along the flat country of the Jordan valley or plain and Boaz &amp; Ruth are scattered all over the landscape also donkeys, arab horses, camels &ndash; pictures by the mile, but the everlasting sense of duty forbids &amp; I stick to "military interest".

 We move on to Jisr Benat Yakub a crossing of the Jordan about 20 miles above the Sea of Gallilee day after tomorrow &amp; then on to Damascus, Amman, Salt &ndash; and home!

 Yours Ever G.A. Lambert (Capt.) Official Artist C/o H.Q. A.I.F. Cairo
