<p>January 1918<br/>on Tuesday Captain Todd turned up &amp; I went round to the National Hotel &amp; had dinner with him and a Lieut Philip from the same Battalion.  We had champagne &amp; quite a dinner.  After dinner they got a box at the Kursaal &amp; we heard the "Scamps" in the "girl on the Train", enjoyed the show.  Captain Todd &amp; Philip I saw a great deal of when in town.  We had a motor ride to Helouan one afternoon &amp; afternoon tea at San Giovanni  Went out to Briggs one <strike>aft</strike> evening Todd charmed them all with his playing &amp; singing.  On Saturday afternoon the 3 of us went to the Races.  I did no good but the other 2 won.  Met a French lady friend Madame Bannarow on the lawn.  Another French woman was with her.  They made us take afternoon tea with them.  She was taken with Todd's Croix de Guerre, &amp; wanted me to bring him out to see her at her home in Helmich.</p>
