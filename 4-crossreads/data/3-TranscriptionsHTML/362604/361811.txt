<p>the Firm per Mr. Eric.  I shall reply as soon as possible.  I spent last Thursday afternoon at a place along the front called Nice-Havrais.  I climbed up a zig-zag path about 500 feet &amp; had a general panoramic view of Havre.  The sea was pretty rough &amp; the numerous small craft in the Bay were tossing about like corks.  I spent the evening at the Y.M.C.A. with Ellis at a Band Concert.  <u>On the 13th</u> Ellis &amp; I moved out of the hut which we occupied with our two Sergeants into one by ourselves.  It is ever so much better fitted &amp; more comfortable &amp; we are alone which is a God Send.  We are as happy as can be now.  The old number you see how it still follows us about.</p>
<p>Well, my Dear ones, I have very little news.  We are both well &amp; if you have not seen Mrs. Thomas, don't tell Her that Ernie was ill.  He is quite O.K. again.  We are sent to Hospital with the slightest sickness here.</p>
<p>Best Love to you all,<br/>Harry.</p>
