<p>10-10-17 This last week has been bitterly cold necessitating a fire (an old oil-drum). One thing, Fritz leaves us alone these wild nights &amp; we are able to sleep peacefully.<br/>We are moving tomorrow up near Ypres, but we will be well protected the Skipper tells us, in bomb proof shelters. We will be camped in a pig stye &amp; we lads in a cowshed &ndash; sounds interesting.<br/>11-10-17 Moved to-day to H15 C58 (Sheet 28) in a fortified farmhouse &amp; we are camping in a pig stye which has been cleaned out &amp; sand bags arranged 3 deep up the sides &amp; on the ceiling. It is black as night all day a very cheery place.<br/>17-10-17 Still at the old farm. Fritz comes over every night dropping bombs. Some of them delightfully close but so far have caused no casualties.</p>
