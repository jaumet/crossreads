  
 at 7 pm Fritz put over a very heavy barrage & caught a Mills Bomb dump about 150 yds from us - immediately there was a cry of Stretcher Bearers - Mick Shean - E. Hand - C. Griese & self doubled down & had to pull out 7 fellows who were all badly cut about - what with the Shrapnel over head & the exploding bombs - we all expected to go up any minute. Repeatedly saw two Infantry men throw themselves forward with a sandbag in front of them & toss boxes of bombs away - some  say V.C.'s have been given for less  - I have noticed many brave deeds done during the last few days, but all done as a duty & no hope of any recognition. Suffice to say as a fitting finale, my squad came thro without a scratch & I don't think I ever said a more fervent little prayer of thanksgiving. We were relieved by 3rd F.A. about 10.30 pm we marched back to "Veaux" where Capt Minty very kindly arranged to take us up in motor buses to a Camp consisting of a few tents on the road to Bapaume on the left of "Favielle", we rolled in dog tired about 4.45 am - and had the first decent sleep since Friday night.
