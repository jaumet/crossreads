<p>cap of a shell, any how it is hard to say what was the real cause only it was a very regrettable incident &amp; very sad, &amp; I trust that it will not be my lot to witness such a scene.   As there were not much to do I finished at 4 Pm.</p>
<p>Friday 11/1/18 &amp; Saturday 12/1/18 was also quiet, with the exception that I was relieved at 2 Pm (14 oclock) at the same time the Paymaster arrived &amp; paid all hands.  I walked back to camp &amp; cleaned myself &amp; dressed &amp; had some Tea when another chum &amp; myself caught a Troop Train &amp; went into Poperinghe &amp; later on to St Omer for 2 days leave.  As it was my long shift off I intended to have another good time away.   On arriving in Town at 5 Pm Saturday we both went along to the Tivoli Theatre &amp; reserved a seat &amp; at 5-30 we both went in &amp; got a comfortable seat &amp; at 6 pm the Variety show started to a packed house.   It was a very poor show &amp; badly managed &amp; after a while the boys started to go out.  Anyhow as we both had plenty of time we stayed till the finish, the Singing &amp; Acting was very poor &amp; not worth mentioning.     It was over at 8 Pm &amp; we just managed to get a drink in an Estaminet nearby &amp; then we both went along to the Y.M.C.A. opposite the station to put in time until the Train left after Midnight</p>
