Hills 1.How can one say the feelings these letters bring - sometimes it seems impossible to bear the awfulness of it - alone & yet there is of course no one in Egypt or this side of the globe in fact to whom I can utter one word.Spence still at home in Aust. & if only he will come through Cairo what will it be to see one of my own again.1/2 day & went Cairo, shopped then Church 6 p.m. & gained a little comfort in its quiet peace.Whist drive 8.30 p.m. very enjoyable, A.S. Club, home in garry with Mr. Dowling & Jack Andrew, nice boys both.
