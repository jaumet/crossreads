  
 May, 1915 Saturday 1  May & here we are still, posted snapshots home yesterday & also sent some to H.L.A.  Last night went to the Opera for Belgian Relief funds. The Boxes are reserved for Harem ladies with Lace curtains in front through which they can see but not be seen - All officers went in honor of our Allies & great enthusiasm was shown - Seats - cost 2/-/- each!!! plenty of use for a man's money -  I could send you much news of our men at the Dardanelles but the Censor would block it - I am sure - so send Love instead.
