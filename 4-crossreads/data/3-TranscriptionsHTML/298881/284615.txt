<p>Herissart 19/7/17<br/>Today is the anniversary of our Fromelles fight last year. Yesterday morning the14th Bde did a route march to Corby a distance of about 10 miles and billeted there for the night. Last night the streets were full of soldiers scrambling, staggering and singing. A disgraceful scene and the soldiers were Australians too unfortunately. They have absolutely no hold on themselves when the drink is about. The remarkable thing is, however, <strike>every</strike> hardly a man fell out on the return journey though there must have been some very sore heads amongst them. It has been excellent weather for marching during the past week.</p>
