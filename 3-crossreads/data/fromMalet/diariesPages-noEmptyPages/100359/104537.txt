Tuesday 4th 
Wrote to Lill. We pitched one bell tent for a couple of sick men, then laid our blankets out on the sand and slept peacefully till about 7.30 next morning. Our white Bags are not with us, and we haven't any writing paper so I cant write home.
30.
Bread and Jam for breakfast and Tea. Our stores were arriving, so we were soon hard at work again pitching another camp. We set up a cookhouse, pitched tents, dug garbage pits and were jolly buy making things comfortable. Phil May and I were told off to cart stones on a stretcher, to fill up a pit for fouled water. We had stew for dinner, and the usual ration of cheese and jam for tea. Our water is brought by canal pack for the Batties, but we have our own water cart and are allowed 2 water bottles full a day to drink and also to wash in and also to do our washing in, so it set us thinking for a while. Now we wash ourselves first, then wash our socks and things in the same water, then we strain the dirty water through a bag of sand and then the rinsing.
Wednesday 5th
Another busy day pitching tents, filling sand bags and making latrines. I wrote Home to Lill on some odd pieces of paper, which I got from the orderly room. Payney and I were told off to put sand bags under the stretchers in the hospital tent. We had bacon for breakfast, and curry for dinner. The afternoon we had to ourselves, and after tea we had to do a quarter of an hour each at digging a hole in the sand to drain away water and bury garbage. Then our days work finished.
