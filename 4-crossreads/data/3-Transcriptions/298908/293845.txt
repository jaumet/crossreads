<p>would have a good chance of getting on the next draft for Aussie.  I am dying to get home &amp; out of this country.  I have an idea that most of my furlough will be spent in New South Wales for apart from home there is nothing whatsoever to keep me in Tasmania.  I have very little time for what people I do know there outside my own relations, but I suppose a chap will know whats doing when the time comes.<br/>I chatted our O.C. for a pass this morning.  I want to get out early &amp; go to a little village down the line.  He is going to fix me up &amp; I am going to take the risk &amp; if I get caught outside the boundary I won't fool Bristoe our O.C. who is a jolly good chap whom we get on with.</p>
<p>10th.  Well I had one of the most enjoyable days that I have spent for some considerable time yesterday afternoon.  Miss Nissen &amp; I went out to Yelverton 11 miles by rail from Plymouth, here we were met at the station by her</p>
