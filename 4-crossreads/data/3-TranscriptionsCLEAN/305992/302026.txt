by some of the officers on arrival at Alexandria. She has disembarked all her cases & sent by rail to Suez transshipment per Kanowra H.M.A.H.S. to Australia.A cargo convoy left today in charge of the American yacht North Star formally Vanderbilt's yacht & trawlers they were attacked by subs a few hours out. The North Star fought same & the convoy returned to Alexandria escorted by trawlers & none the worse for their experience.
July 21st Sunday9 am Left our moorings & went to dry dock for cleaning ship's bottom & painting. Also both aft shafts drawn out, also propellors taken off for repacking. The ship's bottom examined & found distinct dents in plates for a matter of a hundred feet from port side to starboard where we had struck a submarine & sunk one a few month ago off the coast of Sardinia. The impression on the plates under the ship's bottom as plain as if the marks had been chiseled out by man. The marks of the rail of the conning tower very visible & plain.
