made up my mind to attend sick parade yesterday, in fact I was walking over to get a form but thought better of it & turned back. In the afternoon Graham came to see me & nearly persuaded me to transfer into the E&M. but I thought better or worse of it later.
Tuesday 5.2.18 Beautifull weather the last two days. The winter has quite gone. I forgot to mention that Graham is at Hyde Park Corner. His plant lights the Catacombs, Hill 63 load 18 Amps. Staff 12 men. Are we winning

While there Graham showed me through the Catacombs. H63. He said they could hold 30000. They were worth looking at anyhow. Came back through Romarin & made the acquaintance of a Postman named Renee who lives near the church at La Creche. We had several drinks & he invited me to his home. Its surprising how Fritz lest Romarin alone considering its possy & the No of people living there.
7.2.18 Wet & windy. The Japey had a fit of the Sulks last Thursday evening & refused to start, the subsequent proceedings were rather amusing. Not being on shift I took post as an   obser Observer. Froggy as usual got very excited and sweated a treat. He walked around her climbed over her & crawled under her absorbing
