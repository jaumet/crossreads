<p>resumed its normal shape. Another thing the NZ's can show the Australian points on is the interest the flagship takes in the transports. Every morning the flagship of the NZ convoy would call all his convoy up &amp; after wishing them "Good morning" (by radio) he would give the warnews &amp; any other messages &amp; replies that may be of interest. The Australian method ---------Cq (all stations) Orders for the day (given) War news will be sent during the afternoon. (too tired now?) The war news I would often get at 3am from a warship perhaps up at Bombay in India or else from Aden. An hour later another message would be sent cancelling the previous one &amp; issuing another which often had to be altered again. I am not prejudiced against the flagship nor anyone in particular, but never-the-less the way orders were issued, was disgusting, also, on the flagship the "heads" (wooden I think) had a special room for this &amp; another for that, &amp; a special stall for so &amp; so's horse &amp; something else for so &amp; so. To cut a long story short there were enormous sums of money wasted in carrying out each officer's particular desire, instead of giving them a good serviceable room</p>
