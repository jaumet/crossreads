<p>10.12.15<br/>Fri 10th<br/>Was on duty from 10 till 2 last night &amp; Meredith had a stand to Arms &amp; man the trenches order issued at 10 o'clock just to see if we could get out in reasonable time; We did not know at the time that it was only one of the Colonels little fads &amp; we sprang to it; But the C.O. wants to be careful &amp; not repeat it unless he wants to get into rows with the men Every night all the men have to be either in the firing trench or else in the supports, night about in each &amp; during the day time they all do 6 hours pick &amp; shovel work making terraces (to camp on during the winter) tunnelling &amp; keeping the trenches in order &amp; although every man gets to his place as soon as he can at ' stand to Arms' it is not likely</p>
