<p>Taking 18 empty Camels down to Khan Yunis tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.  Tanks crew reckon that we attack tomorrow morning mais juoi je ne pense pas.</p>
<p>16th April<br/>Deir el Belah<br/>I think we attack tomorrow morning.  St. L &amp; I have a job of taking out a convoy of 80 camels in case of emergency to anywhere that they may be required &amp; as the officer in charge is Irish &amp; town-bred &amp; from all accounts is a bit of an idiot St. L. &amp; I have been studying maps &amp; compasses all the morning with a view of nursing him.  It is now dark &amp; we have had no orders yet;  I hope we shall spend a peaceful night.  It wouldn't be much good us starting in the dark for none of us could find our way.  I suppose tomorrow morning they will lift the lid off hell.<br/>Today we put several H.Es. into Gaza.  Must have been an 8 or 9" gun I should think.<br/>If no orders come for us</p>
