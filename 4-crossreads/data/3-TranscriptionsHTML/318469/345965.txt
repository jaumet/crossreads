<p>drawn.  Some Cross &amp; Blackwell strawberry jam had been drawn when some of the boys thought they saw a golden opportunity &amp; so took 4 tins apricot jam &ndash; the bane of our existence &amp; while the Q.M. was absent exchanged them for strawberry.  But there were development as S. Mjr of 2nd F Coy had witnessed the deed promptly reported the happening to our Q.M. who again reported to our O.C. when there was something doing  - the whole Coy had to fall in &amp; the tent our tent was searched &amp; the jam duly found.  However after getting a good rating from the O.C. who duly emphasised the fact on the perpertrators of the dastardly deed that if he were to push the matter they would all get 6 months hard labor, ordered the jam to be returned &amp; the incident closed.  Looked on as a huge joke by the boys!  Was over to "Tommy" Ordinance this morning.</p>
