have not yet got their voices back, & on all sides one hears whispering men & a good deal of coughing. We have played cards each evening lately to pass away the time. Col. Durrant arrived during the week & took over the Bn. - Col. Marks went on leave today to South of France & Italy. I have practised revolver shooting this week with fair results, splitting a beetroot three times out of four shots on an average of 20, 25 or 30 yards.

We had two football (Rugby) matches yesterday "C" Company defeating "D" by 3-0 & "A" defeating B by 9-0. Our men are practising for Bde tournaments. I bought for "C" Coy enough straw for sleeping on but some getting muddy. I tried to get more today but was unsuccessful as there was none beaten. The farmers are all covering their beets for winter feed for stock.
