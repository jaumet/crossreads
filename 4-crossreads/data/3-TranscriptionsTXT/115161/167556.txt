 This is the state of things that I discovered on my return to camp on that my last night, for some years, in Western Australia. 
 I did not sleep in my usual place, and I did not cover myself with my own rug. I was so overcome with the effects of saying good-bye (yes! I fancy I had one or two also) that I really failed to notice anything out of the ordinary, until the following morning. We mostly complained of headache, owing no doubt to the excitement of the past few days!! 
 We breakfasted early, packed all our belongings in the correct military style , and at about 10 a.m. on Wednesday the 20th. September 1916 we fell-in for the last time in camp. 
 The camp commandant addressed us, telling us that our training was complete, that we were the finest body of men that had left&nbsp;the camp, that our &quot;marching and soldierly bearing&quot;, (I raised myself to my full height) was the envy of every other unit in camp. He had no doubt learnt this speech off by heart - the same expressions being used as each unit left camp. He finally concluded his address by wishing us good luck, God speed and a safe return. He felt confident that the fifth&nbsp;reinforcements of the 51st. battalion would uphold the traditions of those who had gone before them, and would make a name for themselves. I think we gave him three&nbsp;cheers, and then with our packs and all the impedimentia required, finally fixed on our backs (and anywhere else anything could hang), the Blackboy Hill Military Band, took its allotted place at the head of the column, the order was given to &quot;Quick March&quot; the band struck up a fine tune, and amid cheers from those remaining in camp, we marched (and marched well too) to the station. 
 We had left the camp, and we were sorry. 
 We had continuously growled to get away from it, but now the time had come, we were loth to leave. 
 Such is human nature. You crave for a certain thing, and when you get it, it loses its charm. So it was with us, we were sorry to leave the old camp, in which after all we had had a jolly good time.
