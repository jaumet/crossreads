 Hospital London 18 Oct 16 My dearest Sister, Your letters are rolling in every week - had a batch several days ago, from yourself Mother Dave &amp; others. I suppose you are surprised that I am still in Hospital &amp; will think I was more than "slightly" wounded - but really my dear my wounds were only slight &amp; I cannot imagine why they wont heal up - my system must have been in a bad way. Had another operation on my right leg yesterday - nothing serious - the Doc cut out the crook part &amp; sewed it up - so wont be long now. I have had a fine fly round London this last five weeks, am very glad I had my money sent over - what a fine opportunity, too good to miss -1 may never get over here again. We met the well known Labour leader John Bums in town the other day, he took us over the Houses of Parliament, he was very interesting explained everything to us. Am going to have tea
