<p>3<br/>The NSW artillery have arrived here from Helles during the time I was at Lemnos. I went over to see them but most of those we know are away. Rex Rabett had just left about an hour before I got there &ndash; for a spell. Olding away sick, and Callaghan away in Alex on Special duty.<br/>Saw Col Christian and Cunningham both of whom are very fit also Capt Thompson whom Father would remember. It seemed like old times to see them all again.<br/>Have heard no word of Reg since Kenneth had the letter from him from Alex. Maurice Ferguson went off sick some little time ago. &ndash;<br/>I found a card from Sis (Aug 20th) and letter from Ted (Aug 26th) waiting me on my return and was glad to hear they were all well. Sis was kind enough to send me some cigarettes &ndash;<br/>Glad to hear Pete has given up the idea of coming away with the force. It will be better for him to let this chance go &ndash; I am afraid our many Friends will think ill of me for neglecting to write more than I do, but it must be put down to lack of time or weariness that such is the case. However I hope you will remember me to all the river friends especially</p>
