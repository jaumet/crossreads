 20th December 1916 Gererat Wednesday Our aeroplanes are out early this morning and circling around &ndash; of course there is no Taube &ndash; Big lot of Canteen stores being distributed very cold this morning and heavy dew. S S M. Fanning has come back to his Squadron as S.S.M. and R.S.M. Crane officiates as the R.S.M. Expecting a move out into the desert shortly. 2.30 pm. Sudden order pack up &amp; get! now for it! pack all saddles and get rid of all spare "dimmage" and now [4.45 pm] we have the saddles packed and ready to put on. The 3rd L. H. Brigade camp came past the camp at 3.30 and they state that they are going on. Which means that they are going only as far as possible probably El Arish if there is not too much opposition. El Arish is reported to be clear of Turks but don't know how true that is. I believe every one on our side is moving. The next few days will be busy. Hope we have plenty of shells &ndash; and plenty of aeroplanes for the daytime. Have just drawn 2 days rations shall certainly be out all night it will be like the old reconnaissances we took part in at Romani.
