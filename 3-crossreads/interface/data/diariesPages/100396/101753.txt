The weather is becoming warmer here. I should not like to be here in summer, it does not suit me here if it would only rain now again things would be better.
One great thing we have here now is a place where we can get for 4 PT. a warm bath. the scheme was thought out by some enterprising Frenchman the Baths have only been open a little while it's a wonder no one thought of it before there are plenty of picture show music halls. where one sometimes has the luck to strike a good programme. also shops of all sorts where you are asked to pay 4 times the value of each article.
