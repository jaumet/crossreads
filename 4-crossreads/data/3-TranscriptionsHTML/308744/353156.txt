<p>After our triumphant entry into DAMASCUS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at dawn on October 1st, it was found that the remnants of the Turkish Armies in PALESTINE and SYRIA, numbering about 17,000 of whom only 4,000 were effective rifles, had fled Northwards  in the form of a disorganised mob, without transport or the equipment necessary to enable it to offer any serious opposition. It was thereupon decided to further exploit our success and on the 5th the Desert Mounted Corps moved on to RAYAK, which was occupied, without opposition, on the following day. At the aerodrome here, which had been used as the German Aircraft Repair Park the remains of 32 aeroplanes were found. All but three had been burnt before abandonment. They included many of the most modern type, and it was learnt later that a number of them had been taken there for repairs after being damaged in the serial combat with our machines, but could not be got ready for the air in time to be flown away before our occupation. Others were damaged by bombs when the aerodrome was raided by eight Bristol Fighters on the 2nd.  A vast amount of aircraft stores also had been burnt.</p>
<p>From here our cavalry moved up the RAYAK VALLEY, capturing in turn HOMS, HAMA and finally ALEPPO. The later city, which fell on October 25th was 300 miles from our former front line, and our cavalry to reach it, had covered 500 miles between September 19th and October 26th.</p>
<p>In the meantime our forces operating in the Coastal Sector continued its advance to BEIRUT and thence on to TRIPOLU. This was greatly facilitated by reports made on all coastal roads, which were reconnoitred and photographed by our machines. BEIRUT was occupied on October 8th and TRIPOLI five days later.</p>
<p>Hostile aircraft made their appearance on October 19th for the first time for several days. Two Bristol Fighters: Pilots:- Capt. R.M. Smith, M.C., D.F.C., and Lieut. E.S. Headlam, Observers: Lieuts. A.V. McCann and W.H. Lilley &ndash; attacked an enemy two-seater about 25 miles South of ALEPPO. The enemy machine succeeded in landing in some open country, when the pilot and observer got out and ran about 300 yards, and held their hands up. Capt. Smith thereupon landed and 'taxied' up to the enemy machine, into which Lieut. McCann fired and Very's light and set it on fire: Capt. Smith then took off and returned to our lines. The German pilot and observer stood by and watched the performance. For this Capt. Smith was awarded a second bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross and Lieut. McCann was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.</p>
<p>Our machines at once set out to locate the aerodrome from which these enemy aircraft were then operating. This was found on the 22nd near MUSLIMIE Junction, about 12 miles North of ALEPPO, where 8 enemy two-seaters were seen. At daylight on the following morning one Bristol Fighter &ndash; Lieut. S.H. Harper (pilot) and Lieut. W.H. Lilley (observer) which had remained at HAMA overnight, flew to MUSLIMIE. Two of the enemy machines were met and forced down on to the aerodrome, where there were four other enemy machines out in the open, apparently just preparing to take off. Lieut. Harper then went down to 200 feet and attacked the enemy machines with bombs and machine gun fire. Several bombs fell within effective range of the machines. Three hours later Major S.W. Addison (pilot) and Lieut. H. Fysh D.F.C. (Observer) escorted by Capt. R. M. Smith, M.C.  D.F.C. (pilot) and Lieut, W.J.A. Weir, D.F.C. (Observer) who took off from HAIFA at dawn arrived over MUSLIMIE and found the enemy aerodrome deserted. The remains of several machines and stores that had been burnt were seen from the aerodrome.  When the place was occupied by our troops a day or two later, the charred remains of the machines and five fuselages were found there.</p>
<p>An Armistice with Turkey came into operation at noon on the 31st.</p>
<p>NOVEMBER: Following upon the suspension of operations, a comparatively small amount of flying was done.  The chief occupation of our machines was the maintenance of an aerial despatch service from HAIFA to ALEPPO and intermediate centres of importance.</p>
<p>A special reconnaissance was made on the 13th to locate our</p>
