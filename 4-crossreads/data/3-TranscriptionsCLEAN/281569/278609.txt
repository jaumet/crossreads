 The remounts we brought in yesterday behaved very well during the night. At 9.30 the Brigadier inspected the Brigade & saw that everything was OK for the move this week which had been postponed to Friday. I went into the Savoy with a urgent to Gen Faire re remounts but could get no satisfaction, came out in a hurry & went to the review which was nothing like the ones of old. Mick M has got 6 months furlough to Australia & Steel 12 months in the afternoon I rode one of the remounts he gave me a rough passage what with aeroplanes & eagles, it was none to pleasant for either the horse or I. Stiny, Hal & I went down the town after tea called in at the Studio got our photos, had a feed as per usual & a bath which was highly appreciable. The C.O. rode the Doug into town in the afternoon & succeeded in getting our money much to our gratification, Pay in the morning. Bed 10.30

 74 wks of soldiering 
 Nothing of much importance through the day the mounted men had a full marching order parade, I went into Cairo early & did my usual round of visits getting back in time for dinner in the afternoon Charlie & I went for a spin out El Marq way we warmed the bikes up on several occasions & they stood up to it good-oh although perhaps a little too much valve rattle, Hal & I went down the street after tea & called in at the Russian studio, collected photos & said goodbye to Roalic  who has promised to write he also promised to send ouy photos of he & his friend had another bath & got home about 10 tired and ready for bed. Our horses were realloted today & I now have a big upstanding bay mare 161/2 hds high the largest & fastest horse in the troop I've named her Lev in remembrance of its late owner.
