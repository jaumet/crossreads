"Crash" Crash" Crash" they came. I could hear the swish of the last one as it was falling just behind the Train. That was our last narrow escape. We reached Boulogne &#64; 4.0AM. . It is now 11.30AM and the 5.0AM for Calais has not arrived yet. I took the liberty of Boarding a leave special that left Boulogne at about 3.30P.M. and came to Steenwerck myself, at Hazebrouck the M.Ps made me get off & get into another but as soon as they left I climbed in again & sat down with a prisoners guard the M.P.s thought I belonged to the Gaurd & I got through O.K. The Railway Traffic is rather disorganised owing to Fritzs rapid advance on Amiens. 
 Thursday 28.3.18  Some of our mob who were in Bailleul came in today. Fritz made it too hot for them. He is coming through like a house afire on the Somme. The latest report is that he has got Dernancourt. 
 Bell (Will Stewart's friend) got his head blown off by a Bomb at Bailleul the other night. 
 Friday 29/8  All the French Boys about here over the age of 16 have    to go  been called up. I believe they go on munitions or reserve line work. Things must be very serious alright. 
 Saturday 30/3  Very quiet today. There
