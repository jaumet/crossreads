of 92 stretcher bearers in the Bullecourt that only 11 were not hit. My squad is no more. Two were killed outright one had two legs blown off. The chap who took my place was not hurt. I wonder if I would have come out of it but anyway it has turned out for the best. Had I not got appendicitis I would have been in the stunt as my hand was better by that 
So glad you remembered my birthday I hope you got the card I sent you. I was confirmed Monday night it will give me more strength to believe in Him for really dear I have learnt many things while I have been in France the seeds that were sown in our young life have just began to spring up. Why one can't help but believe in God after going through one or scraps never knowing whose going up next. Look I must not write like this as you will think I am very depressed I really am not but then its makes you serious when so many of your pals go under. Well dear old Sis I will close now hoping that you, Vol and N are in the best of health all happy contented, sending you my fondest true 
love from your ever loving brother XXXXXXXXX
