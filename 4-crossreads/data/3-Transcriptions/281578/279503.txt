After carrying up the food &amp; partaking of ours, we began digging again about 10.30 p.m. About midnight a chap carrying a big thermos stumbled on to the trench we were digging in the dark, poor beggar was lost, he had been carrying stew to B Coy's posts out in front, &amp; lost his way trying to get back.

Wedn 15 May Knocked off digging at 1.30 am &amp; went down for the dry rations &amp; tea, they were carried back &amp; handed out before daylight.
