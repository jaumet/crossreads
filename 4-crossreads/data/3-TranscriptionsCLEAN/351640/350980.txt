How lovely the bowl of wattle must have looked, that you brought from Cronulla as a trophy to the motor drive, Mrs Parsons took you. She was kind to you. Fancy wounded men in Australia when you were passing along George Street. I fear me that you will have plenty more during the coming months. Yes many of the men who arrived went through my hospital. I received a letter from one who lives at Summer Hill, he found a newly arrived daughter ready to greet him. There are none braver than the medical men and the priests. God bless them. Many thanks for the copies of the S.M. H. and other papers. Sir John See was very fond of Jim. I hope that both of the boys will have good fortune wait upon them.

Desireable sites every where for residences. You had a very good stand for the stall on Australia day. Hope that you did well? Tell Maria to beware of Nuts? Silly girl to chance them once more. An experiment probably to find if she were growing more resistant to them. Not so. How good of Mrs Franki to think of us and make the covers for the milk jugs, just the thing I am wanting at the moment, when they come they will be made use of, it is said by residents that Septbr. & October are the worst months for flies. My regards to all the Frankies. My love to the Adams girls. How is the poetess? 
 Kitty dear: Very sorry dear to learn that you had been troubled with [so] 
 ["Australia Day", 30 July 1915, was a national fundraising day " an offering of gratitude - a pouring out of love from our hearts, and of money from our pockets, money to provide comforts and nursing assistance for those who have fought so valiantly" (Sydney Morning Herald, Saturday 31 July 1915).
