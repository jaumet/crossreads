<p>13/4/16</p>
<p>Thurs 13th<br/>It has been a very disagreeable day a strong wind blowing &amp; a little dust with it;  Today is Eric Dowlings 20th birthday &amp; we are celebrating it tonight by having a little feast;  Butter, Dowling McFarlane Cameron, Trickett, Les &amp; myself run a mess between us &amp; live fairly well;</p>
<p>Kamel who professes to be a Christian &amp; was in England studying for a Dr when war broke out, now runs the Canteen here in Camp &amp; is out to make all he can, sugar in the Canteen is 5 PT a lump &amp; only 3 &frac12;  in the village alongside us; condensed milk is also 5 PT a tin, &amp; Kamel can hold his own now with any of the troopers in a swearing match;</p>
<p>The Colonel had a nasty ride home last night &amp; was in a bad humor when he got there as he ordered Granny out of the Mess &amp; prohibited all gambling &amp; shouting in Officers Mess</p>
