he told us that we are the best infantry brigade in France. He is rather a decent old bird this Leslie; even if he is a Canadian.
1st June 1916.
There is a divisional competition pending, and a contest was held in the Battalion this week to decide which Company would represent the 3rd Battalion; in the competition between the crack "coys" of the other battalions of the Brigade. The winner of which, will represent the first brigade in the divisional Competition. The scheme is to decide which is the crack infantry company in the 1st Division. My Company will represent the 3rd Battalion in the Brigade Contest next week. It will mean hard work, but we will pull it off for the glory of the good old 3rd. Was paid 40Francs.
