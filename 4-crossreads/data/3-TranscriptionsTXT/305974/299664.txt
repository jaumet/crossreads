 13 Monday There is word that the bombardment is from here right up to the sea on the whole of the western Front.  It is a very bleak day.  We are all packed up ready to go up into the trenches.  We left Ribemont about 1 pm &amp; marched to Dernancourt a distance of about four miles.  The roads were exceptionally muddy in places.  Received a letter from home &amp; one from Doris also a  letter  Parcel of cigarettes from O. Turner. 
 14 Tuesday My word the German prisoners are made work, road maintenance generally.  They seem to be well looked after though.  We fell in about 8 am &amp; marched to Longueval.  It is absolutely the worst march I have done in my life.  We had to contend with being blocked up with traffic, mud, etc.  We are now about 4 miles from the line.  Fritz put up a good few big shells on a hill about 300 yds away. As we were coming in I saw the Prince of Wales going back on a horse. 
 15 Wednesday One of the big shell burst in a tent belonging to the 13th Fld Amb. killing one wounding two.  It was an exceptionally cold morning this morning, nearly Freeze a person.  Fritz is still shelling the hill.  Detailed for road making all day.  We have to take about 15 inches of cloggy mud off the road &amp; put down metal, it keeps a fellow very warm this weather.  Everywhere about this place there is about 12 inches of mud.  Very cold evening.  Most of the fellows are living in huts I am in a dug out.
