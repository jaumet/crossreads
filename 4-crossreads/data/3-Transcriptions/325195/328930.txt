<p>7.9.15<br/>Les and I went for our daily dip, our tin of Curry is nearly finished, so we worded one of the Indians for some to-day. The Indians had no powder but gave us some curry grains &amp; told us to call tomorrow for curry. After we had finished swimming we decided to go around to Anzac to see if we could buy any eggs from the sailors, but our trip proved a failure; a German Taube flew over us to-day &amp; opened fire with a machine gun on some of our positions this is the first machine I have seen with a machine gun mounted on her. A fatigue party was sent around to  B.H.Q: for Canteen Stores this afternoon. This Regt has been having a fairly rough time of it here doing fatigue work etc. A pinnace off one of the war boats was raised at Anzac this afternoon, it had been sunk close to shore.</p>
