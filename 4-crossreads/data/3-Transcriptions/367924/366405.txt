<p>they lay the dead and let the Hawks eat them. They have a lovely [indecipherable] gardens here. I wish I had known I would have brought more money, then I could have bought some lovely things here, to send home.</p>
<p>I have sent a Photo of the 9th A.L.H. to Nell for you to get, I am sitting on the end of the stool. That was taken in the last port we was in. My word I will be pleased to get some news from home again. I expect you will have had some of my letters by this time. I hope so at any rate. If you send any parcel to me at all put in a box of <strike>Euth</strike> throat menthols jubes also a tube of Anaglesic Balm I have found that very usefull several times lately.</p>
<p>We have a fine Leut in charge of us, one of the very best. We do not have to do much work only two hours a day on board. There is not much happens on board a ship to write about. There are six ships all travelling together with a Man of War for escort, so we feel fairly safe. I keep taking En&oacute;s Fruit Salts to try and keep in good health, it is three Shillings a bottle on board. It is just as well I keept two Shillings a day other wise I would be always broke, it is surprising how quick money goes.</p>
<p>W. Batts brother is on board with us also Dick Parnell and one of the Hams from Tambellup. Remember me to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Delaney also Tommy Norrish's lot. We are only allowed to write two pages now, because of the censure having to read them. I suppose I might see Jack Norrish soon now. Has Uncle Johnny come over yet. If you see H. Prisse any time Remember me to him.</p>
<p>I saw five Hospital Ships in the last port we called at, they look very pretty of a night they are light up from Bow to Stern with either Red or Green lights about a foot apart. Well I must close with sending you my best love and best wishes and Remember me to the Boss also all friends. I expect that you are having some fairly hot weather home now. How was the bush fires this year.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your loving Son</p>
