  
 [1st Aug. contd] good & it was still raining & as I had  a bon by head I stopped in bed.  The news which subsequently came thro was good & we learnt that an advance had been made on a 15 mile front to a depth of 4 1/2 miles in one part and the villages of Bixchoote, St Julien, Hooge & other places were captured & 5000 prisoners & 8 guns.  Rained has interfered with further action.  Germans had counter attacked but we have regained all the ground lost.  Our party returned after being on duty about 50 hours without a spell in water up to their knees. 
 Thursday 2nd [Aug] Raining like billeo all day. 
 Friday 3rd Still raining, some cases of rheumatism & bad feet the results of standing for hours up to their knees, began to come in.  I got up out of bed today & did a little work feeling  a bit dizzy at first. 
 Saturday 4th A queer sight met the eye this morning.  Some of the boys clothes were still wet so they were issued with a pyjama suit each & altho it was raining & very muddy, the boys still carried on with jamas rolled up to the knees & slippers on their feet. 
 Sunday 5th Walked to Ballieul & had a hot bath in a house
