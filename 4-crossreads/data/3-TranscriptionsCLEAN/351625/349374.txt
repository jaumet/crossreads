  
 Alcester is about 5 miles from Stratford on Avon, the country about is very pretty, we were trying to get leave to go to Stratford but couldent, you have to be in every evening a 6 p.m. & they are very strict about us being in to time.  I was up before the head at the other hospital on being in 8 minutes late but of course nothing was done to us.  I think I have just about given you all the news so will say au revoir with best love & kisses to all. 
 From Your loving Son Douglas 
 P.S.  will be writing to father soon. Doug.
