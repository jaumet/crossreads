<p>Saturday 13 March 1915</p>
<p>Nothing particular to note to-day.  Much to the annoyance of everybody, the 13th was ordered to carry out a forced march during the morning, while the other battalions, on account of yesterday's hard day, were permitted to rest in their tents.  And a forced march it was;  for during the morning, we must have covered at least ten miles, and that over very difficult country.  The sandy nature of the ground makes walking very hard;  hence everybody is developing most remarkable leg muscles.</p>
<p>One incident of the morning called forth a short address from the Colonel before we dismissed for the afternoon.  Our second-in-command had given a certain order, and was hooted for his trouble.  So the Colonel, with righteous indignation, complained of a certain lack of discipline in the regiment, especially as we were on the verge of an active service campaign.  We were congratulated on last week's work &ndash; the most strenuous of the battalion's existence &ndash; by the divisional commander and by General Birdwood, but, at the same time, we were reminded how necessary it was to overcome that one serious weakness characteristic of all colonial contingents &ndash; a lamentable lack of discipline.  "Military discipline is going to win this war, and that only, not brillancy, in skirmishing and shooting," concluded the Colonel.</p>
