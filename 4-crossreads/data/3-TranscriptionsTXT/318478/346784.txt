 The charm of writing with a black leaf as it was called, what time I earned my " living " (Why?) at the age of 12&frac12; years, is that one can review, next day, one's mistakes.

Today or rather tonight &ndash; tomorrow to be accurate (0100 &ndash; 25/7/19) &ndash; I sit in quite a good room which is smelling of paint, it is true, but not my paint, thank goodness, with half a suit of pyjamas on my silly old weather beaten body, after having got rid of or having  lost  4 charming guests, male, and one or two of 'em got away with sincere introductions to Chelsea.

 * Original lost &amp; found &ndash; tissue mistaken for original of Duplicate book, explanations later.
