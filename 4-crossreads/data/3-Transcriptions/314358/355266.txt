<p>5<br/>Of some of those pictures which will for ever facinate and disturb me.</p>
<p>It is so easy to say 'I will' do this, yet how difficult it is?  It is only when we stoop to collect that we find the loss.</p>
<p>Memory, after all, retains not everything, nor is there sequence in her treasurery.</p>
<p>I find the brilliant beast is forever lost, while little drab fragments are left, and even those are scattered,-missplaced, or fractured</p>
<p>How can I assemble and re-set the scattered pieces? The few drab fragments are quite insufficient. I shall, perhaps, after many moments of labor, do no more than set up in misplaced sections and broken disjointed lines, corners of those vivid tessilations of a moment which flashed in their terrible splendour and were gone.</p>
