<p>up to what is known as the advanced base, so my guardian angel isn't about for me to appeal to. Headquarters has been here before and on that occasion a shell hit the clock tower of a lodge at the gate entrance. The lodge was in use at the time as the sergeants' mess and several of them were killed. The tower is lopsided and battered but manages to keep from falling down.

From above no one would know the ground was disturbed.</p>

Headquarters calling for my work, to see if, on the strength of it, I was to get my com. He was as usual, sympathetic and said they couldn't expect much for the short time and in the circs. "Anyhow", he said, "we'll fight 'em." He at once rang up H.Q. and ordered a room for me and I am going to get as busy as I can, so as to finish a few more sketches, though this hurry up is the worst thing for work.
