<p>22/4/17<br/>Favreuil<br/>The Padre had arranged some services as the day is Sunday but orders for a 2 Brigade stunt cancelled everything. From 9.30 we practised our attack with flags as barrages close to camp but owing to lack of explanation to officers it was not too good. Some of our new subalterns are miles removed from the high standard of old days. After a hurried lunch everyone fell in at noon and marched over to a field between Sapignies and Bullecourt. Two brigades were there and stunted &ndash; fine sight to see the attacking waves going over the green slopes. The barrages were represented by Light horsemen. On every side a fine vista of gentle sunny fields and woods. Were it not for the ruined villages one would never know the Hun had been over it. Reached camp at 5. Mess at 7 with 7th Brigade band playing. Hostile air craft active today and one was only a few hundred feet overhead early and neither m.g. or our fire could hit him. Later he crashed with phosphorus one of our balloons. Heavy outburst of guns about 8.30 out in front, a menacing growler is the 18 pounder</p>
