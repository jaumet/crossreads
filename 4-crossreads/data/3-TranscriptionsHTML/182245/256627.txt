<p>1917 APRIL</p>
<p>22 SUNDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; beautifully sunny &amp;</p>
<p>warm. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>all day. Leave was granted</p>
<p>in afternoon to about 40%</p>
<p>&amp; most of them went to a place</p>
<p>called &quot;Desveres&quot; about 6</p>
<p>kilos away. I got news from</p>
<p>mother that Alan had been</p>
<p>missing since 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of the</p>
<p>month. I only hope that he</p>
<p>has not had any serious</p>
<p>accident, but has only been compelled to land in the</p>
<p>Hun lines. Lord grant that</p>
<p>thats all that has happened</p>
<p>He had just gained his</p>
<p>captaincy &amp; been recommended</p>
<p>for the Military Cross. Its</p>
<p>rotten how all the best</p>
<p>are taken.</p>
