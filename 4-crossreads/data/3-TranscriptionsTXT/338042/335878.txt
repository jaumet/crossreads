 May 22nd The "Anzac Coves" journey to "48 Squadron" R.F.C. and prepare hall &amp; stage for the night &ndash; Oh what a change from London &ndash; A very old "unshapely shed is our new theatre. At 8.30 p.m. with our "English Programme", we open to a large audience of Australians. Pommies. Canadians &amp; Americans. The show theatrically speaking is an absolute "riot". For first time I recite, "If" (by Kipling. After the show we are most kindly spoken to, by our Organiser &amp; Officer, Major Churchill, who is leaving us in a couple of days.
