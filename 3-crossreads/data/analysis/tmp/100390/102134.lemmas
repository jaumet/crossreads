 ?1915 I often long to see the kiddi if onli for a littl while ? There are few soften influenc in this game as you may guess . I got altogeth in the last few month 2 Lone Hand and 2 paper . ( 1 Tabl Talk 1 Herald ( Melb ) ) for which mani thank I think in fact Im sure I acknowledg them as well as the tobacco pouch for all of which Im veri grate . I just saw a funni littl incid one chap has got a darn duck in his tent . A littl pool with rock round it the pool made of canva in which the duck swim . If you were in this game you ?d realiz what a mad thing this is . Yarra Bend must have lost a few when we left . Men here do all sort of crazi thing . If a chap has a looney streak it come out in soldier
