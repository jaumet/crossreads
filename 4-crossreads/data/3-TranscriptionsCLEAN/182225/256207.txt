 1916   MONDAY 21   FEB. 
 Fine & hot. Foot slogging in the park all the morning. The O.C (M r  Campbell) delt with a petition we all signed & gave up to him, asking him to remove Sargent Major [Fulkes?] as we thought he was not competant to drill us. He said it was open mutiny to send up that petition, but he just treated it as foolishness, which it was. If I had read the thing I would never have put my signature to it. 
 Got late leave and also got the early train to Sydney. Got my watch glass put in at Hardy's and asked P.S.&B to get me a box for Wednesday night at the Criterion. Had late leave & Linda & self went to the Cremorne Pictures  Went home in the 11.35 train to Marrickville
