<p>in the ruins of the sugar refinery.</p>
<p>While cleaning my equipment I noticed that my gas mask was punctured in several places, and many bullet marks were visible in my tunic and breeches.&nbsp; I was glad that after all I was a small man.</p>
<p>We wondered when we should be moving further &quot;back&quot; for our anticipated rest.&nbsp; We were soon to know, when we were to move and in which direction.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXV1.</p>
<p><u>A DISAPPOINTMENT.</u></p>
<p>As before stated we felt sure we were moving away from the front for a spell.&nbsp; Of course we don&#39;t.&nbsp; The authorities apparently imagine that we revel in this kind of sport.&nbsp; However we keep on smiling, we may, some of us get a longer rest than we expect before long.&nbsp; Anyway what&#39;s the use of worrying?&nbsp; We are content so long as only mud and our good luck sticks to us.</p>
<p>After remaining in this village for&nbsp;two days, we are ordered to prepare to go forward again.&nbsp; We wonder what has happened.&nbsp; Had the enemy retaken the position which had cost us so dearly to gain? and had our relief been driven out?&nbsp; No! this could not be.</p>
<p>Well!&nbsp;we all march off again observing the same rules as before leaving the ruined village about 9 p.m. and after a few &quot;spells&quot; arrive at a new position, adjoining a railway line, soon after midnight.&nbsp; Our company was escorted to a fine &quot;cutting&quot; in the hill, with very high banks on either side, and good dug-outs which had lately been occupied by the enemy.&nbsp; We congratulated ourselves on our good fortune.&nbsp; Naturally we spoke too soon, for after we had been there for a few minutes only it was discovered that we were in the wrong place.&nbsp; We moved further along to a spot on the railway line which was all flat country.</p>
<p>Here we have to make our own dug-outs, and not much time is wasted as&nbsp;the enemy occupies the hill a very short distance in our front, and we must get&nbsp;out of sight before daybreak.</p>
