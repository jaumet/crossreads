<p>out of the Harbour and set sail for Tasmania (we know not which Port).</p>
<p>A great day with plenty of warm, bright sunshine.&nbsp; If this Winter, it is going to be dreadfully hot in Summer.</p>
<p>I am now in charge of the Isolation Hospital, but luckily there are no patients.</p>
<p><u>July 19th</u></p>
<p>With strong wind behind us we put up our greatest mileage - 275 for the day.&nbsp; Two patients</p>
