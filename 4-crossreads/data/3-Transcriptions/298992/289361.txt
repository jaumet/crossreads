<p>Dearest Mother,</p>
<p>We are getting very near the end of our journey. Crossed the Line a few days ago, and should be off Aden next Tuesday. Then we have 4 days run up the Red Sea, and shall probably disembark, and take the train to Suez. on Saturday, a week from now.</p>
<p>It has been a glorious trip ever since leaving Albany. The sea has been perfectly calm, and the boat just seems to glide along. She is a lovely steamer, and the largest I have ever been on, for a trip. In Hazel's letter I told all about my luck in getting a <strike>de</strike> cabin to doss in, and as far as I am concerned, I may be a Saloon passenger, except for the tucker, and that hardly comes up to Saloon standard, though personally I have no complaints to make. We get plenty of fresh meat &amp; vegetables &amp; soup besides prunes &amp; figs, rice &amp; plum pudding. Of course there are always some growlers everywhere, and we have some here, but I think they are a long way in the minority.</p>
