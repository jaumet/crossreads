10th August:- ThursdayAwoke late (8 am) and after a hurried toilette & breakfast reached Hdqus at 9-10 am. It was rather cold & raining (the first rain I have seen since last Christmas in Egypt). Cleared up later on to a nice day. Lunch at Salvation Army as usual which cost 1fr 25c & a good lunch too. Am feeling very unwell & done up & even worse today. Determine to see the doctor & get a few days off duty. This cold & the continued rough living has pulled me down thoroughly. After tea take a long walk with Sgt Lake around the hill overlooking Rouen commanding a fine view of the town. Some very nice residences & clean streets & the air is beautifully clear. A cup of coffee awaits me at home, & after a chat (in French) to Madame    & Madamoiselle, go to bed rather late
