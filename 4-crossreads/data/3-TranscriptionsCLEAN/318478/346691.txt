The cook is grudgingly acquiescing in the building of a new cook house, though he would much sooner use one established in 1915 by Jacko across the gully & submit to the Asiatic flea bug & louse & carry water & grub about a hundred yards than get into something new and efficient - hence the war.

Lambert A.I.F. War Records Section C/o 28th Division Chanak.  Messages & letters come over with the rations.
