 Argument with Egyptian boot black. Got garry to National Hotel. Leaving there drove to Madame - a most beautiful residence. Dinner & several wets at the Petrograde where I met Charlie Holt. Later on at the same place dropped across Clyde Smith & Sgt Deery. Got a list to port which resulted in loss of great coat. Met Italian officer at the American Bar. Very sick coming home saw Arnold Markey in train. Arrived back to camp at 2 am next day. 
 17.2.16 Suffering recovery after the night at the same time stretcher drill on the desert. Major Aidy takes command of B. Section. Swim in the canal much better.
