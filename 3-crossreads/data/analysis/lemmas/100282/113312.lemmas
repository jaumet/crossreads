 reserv my opinion until some futur date , as it no good be predjuic Saw a Regiment of Canadian march out through Ypres this morn with their colour fli 4 Sgts an offic were escort to it . 3rd Frank Forder I had to re-organ the Coy this morn , cut the establish down from 4 to 3 Platoon caus a bit of grous but one has to expect this of a disagre job . Jack Hay I chat the Capt about let us get away togeth on Pari leav , he said he would do his best for us when we came out of the "forward area" . A German plane came down veri low this morn , there was a fine rattl of machin gun , but I think he got away safe . Everi man in the Compani has been issu today with a set of 8 button catch to sew on his overcoat , copi the French again , the idea be to loop the overcoat up so keep it
