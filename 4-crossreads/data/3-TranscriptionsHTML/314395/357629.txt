<p>gas burns.  The latest gas is invisible &amp; has no smell, and one does not know it's over until seized with a fit of sneezing or else gets burnt by it.</p>
<p>Bryant Sheehy came to see me about a week ago, and he is looking splendid.  He has filled out a good deal.</p>
<p>I hope soon to visit some of the friends of the Husband of my Father's Sister;  as we are not very far from a certain town <strike>where</strike> mentioned in a couple of the addresses he gave me.  Furlough to England has started again, and I expect to go in about two months time.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br/>Your affect. Son,<br/>George</p>
