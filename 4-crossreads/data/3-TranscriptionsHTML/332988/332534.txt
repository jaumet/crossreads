<p>Presently at an altitude of approximately 8000 feet, two black specks could be seen closing in on him and the rattling of their machine-gun could be heard. A few moments later the Hun plane was afire and cork-screwing giddily down. The man had jumped or fell out, and a dark body was seen shooting earthwards. The plane broke in halves and fell some distance away from its former occupant. Another of the "missing".</p>
<p>"Dinkum" Rest<br/>Three weeks later, travelling partly by motor-bus and partly by marching the 1st Division reached the town of Deves. This town is situated about 20 kilometres from Boulogne. It was just the place for a spell from the trenches as Fritz never bombed it. The morning parade used to fall in on the Market square, afterwards marching out on the parade ground. The town's people had never seen Australians drilling before and made us very welcome. Generally route marches and foot-ball and sports took the place of Physical training. Some days we went by Companies to the Cement Works had a bath in the warm water there, washing our clothes and drying them around the huge revolving cylinders of the works.</p>
<p>After seventeen days spell tje Division marched out and up towards the Flanders Front.</p>
