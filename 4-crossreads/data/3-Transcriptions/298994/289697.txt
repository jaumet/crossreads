<p>Another 5 miles of hard going and we were comparatively safe again We stayed the night at a camp, known as Wheal Camp. We did look pretty objects the next morning with the slush &amp; mud!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we had orders to be ready to move off from our camp at 1.30. We embarked in motor buses to a "new home" or billets This was Sept 1st 1917.</p>
