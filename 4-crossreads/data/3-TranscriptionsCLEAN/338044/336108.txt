  
 3rd Nov:- Am feeling rather ill this morning & was same during the night. Parade sick at 6 am when names are taken  &  we Parade again at 8-15 am    &  are marched to Dispensary, where after a good wait I get a dose of Bismuth & no duties for the day. Slept after lunch until 5 pm &  so missed having my medicine at 4-30. Arriving at Cairo rather later than usual I met a few friends &  again went around the Arabic quarters, afterwards having a donkey ride. Imagine my surprise on dismounting to see a friend - an old Pal - Pelham de Mestre, who I thought to be still at the front. He returned with Malaria & is now on duty at Intermediate Base, Cairo  Now visit his quarters, where we have some refreshments &  I return home late
