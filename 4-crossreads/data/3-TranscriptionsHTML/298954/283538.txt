<p>1917<br/>Sat. 20th Oct.<br/>There are no signs of life whatever, although Martin says there is a settlement on one of the atolls.</p>
<p>The Germans did not send out landing parties here, as at Sunday Island, Waigiou, and the Maldives.</p>
<p>The "Hitachi" followed us in and tied up alongside;   the decks well filled with passengers and our ex-companions, now attired in spotless garb.  They <u>do</u> look disconsolate at the thought of again partaking of "Wolf's" hospitality.</p>
<p>Webb in particular;   on the night he went aboard the Jap. ship he amused the gloomy groups on the "Wolf's" poop by playing "Pack up your troubles in your Old Kit Bag" on the "Hitachi's" saloon piano and singing it in a cracked baritone.</p>
<p>He needs someone to sing it to him now.   The stewardess and "the Deluge" sent very scandalous rumours about each other back to the highly delighted crowd aft.</p>
