London is a long way off from me.I am going to Meteren" tonight to have a look round.The weather is very unsettled it is raining hard which makes things very unpleasant, but one naturally expects this.The Farm where I am staying now is called Moolenacher is on the road to Meteren".It is a secluded little spot is approached by shady lanes with hedges on either side is very pretty in effect.The Guns are beginning to boom again after a pretty quiet time. So far today the aeroplanes are inactive.

The weather broke this morning so far it has turned out to be fine. Last night in company with the F.S.Sgt I went for a stroll through several villages viz, Fletre, Strazza Rue Croix . They are all rural villages in this Department are all very pretty. It is fine to walk along the Roads all bordered in by hedges crops of a lovely natural green, the country makes it hard to believe that fighting is so very close.There was an artillery duel last night but we are all becoming used to it now lose no sleep over it.They were sending up Star Shells they were very pretty when they exploded with the dark sky as a background.
