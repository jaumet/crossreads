<p>Well, Mother its not often I am stuck for news, but I really have nothing to tell you just now. Am quite well, and feeling ready for anything that happens along. Have written often to Joan &amp; Dulcie &amp; received a long letter from Aunt Soph, a few weeks ago. Coleridge dropped in to see me lately, he is in the 45th Battalion.

Many Happy Returns of 17th June for Hazel, &amp; you can get her something nice for me.</p>
<p>Heaps of Love to all the family,</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
<p>Alan.</p>
