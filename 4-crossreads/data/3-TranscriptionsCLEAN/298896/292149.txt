The day started cool but warmed up & I appreciated the rest. No word of moving yet. Our 1st Div. total of prisoners is now 2000 with 60 officers. Elsewhere we are pushing the hun back & all appears bright.
Sunday 25th Aug.Passed rather a poor night. About 10 P.M. one plane bombed our camp with grass cutting bombs. The nearest to my tent was 30 yds another 45 yds & the air was thick with dirt, dust smoke & the smell of powder. Two horses were wounded, one of which we had to shoot during the day. Dozens of planes were over & it was a continuous hum overhead for a couple of hours, quite the reverse of a comforting noise. Rumours of a move again. Had one swim only as have a touch of neuralgia. Sent a req. in for signature. Transferred to a dugout during the day, also wrote some letters. A cool change in the weather with rain.
