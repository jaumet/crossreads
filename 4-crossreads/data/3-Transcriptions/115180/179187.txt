<p>again. Daddie has just said &quot;When is Ellis coming &quot;again,&quot; I am saying, oh, he will come one of these days, for sure, we know, it is very quiet here, and a long long way to come, so that Siddie knows he and you come home just as ourselves, come when you wish we are happy to have you with us, all this you are sure about, so I will dry up, as folks say.</p>
<p>Harry boy it is absolutely lovely here at present, the trees are fairly well leafed, and the hawthorn, gorse, lilac and wild flowers are perfect. I have been to Kirk Michael with Uncle to day in the little cart for some timber how I wished you had been with us. Marie was house keeper, and tomorrow we, (Uncle &amp; I) are off to Douglas. Uncle, will remain but I am returning in the evening. We do miss you Harry boy, your little thoughtful kindnesses to us al,l touch our very hearts you are so ready to help, &amp;</p>
