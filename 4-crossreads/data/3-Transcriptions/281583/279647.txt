<p>Both days were occupied in moving up to Belgian Front area &amp; once more we are sleeping to the accompaniment of the thundering of big guns. It is not quite so bad as the Somme but there happens to be a heavy battery close to us &amp; when they fire salvoes which they do regularly right throughout the night it shakes our bivy.</p>
<p>We are all camped in Huts built close to the ground for warmth &amp; it resembles a Rabbit Warren to look at it. We have a large stove in the centre of our hut &amp; it is great to make toast on &amp; for warmth. We are living well &amp; altogether I think that we are as comfortable as ever we have been. It goes without saying that the ground is always swamped, being in the low parts of Belgium, or Flanders as it is called, but this difficulty has been overcome by laying duck boards down &amp; digging trenches  underneath, so that the water runs</p>
