<p>17 February, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>Picquet to night but I did not have a bad time as I did not follow out orders to the letter indeed when I suggested to Joe Woods that he &amp; I would work together as mates on the same shift he told me point blank that if we were to work as mates that we would split the shift unless on the first.  Any way we happened to draw first shift, 8.30 to 12.0. The Orderly Officer came around at 10.30 so Joe &amp; I tossed to see who would go to bed &amp; who would stay on until 12.0 &amp; I won.</p>
