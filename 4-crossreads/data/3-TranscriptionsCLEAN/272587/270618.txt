  
 Nov 10th  Beautifully fine day but place is still muddy.  Shelling is not severe & very few casualties have arrived.  A German aeroplane brought down in flames a few hundred yards away.  Living comparatively well.  Nights are now drawing in & it is dark from 5 to 6.  Baupaume is distinctly visible & seems only a couple of miles away. Nov 11th   Still good weather.  Shelling not too severe though Fritz livened up this afternoon & night.  A raid by a party of bombers failed & everyone of the party were wounded or killed.  We had a trip to between trenches for a patient. Nov 12th   Last night was very busy & we had three stiff carries a piece.  Shelling more severe than usual.  The part we went to between lines was just in front of Guedocourt wood where there is a dug out in our occupation.  Jack Tweddel has died of his wounds.  Baupume up to this morning has not been bombarded but now the tower is missing & the bombardment of the place has commenced. Nov 13th.   Move back with the division to Longueval again   Relieved by the 4th Division.  The illumination mentioned on the 6th inst was caused by a successfull raid by German planes on a French munition dump.  Damage 1,000,000.  Percy James has been mentioned for work done in the stunt a few nights ago & Blondon & the W.O. have been decorated by M.M. (2nd for ?)  Heavy shelling last night.  Coming out this morning I noticed some men getting "tanks" ship shape, oiling, etc. so this with the fine weather lately seems to portend another big move. Nov 14th  Awoke this morning to hear all the batteries in the dist in action.  The heaviest bombardment I have heard since Pozieres.  It transpires that the German line was taken in places and the ridge (commanding Baupume) & three villages have been taken & are holding.  Prisoners are coming in.  Our plat. was shelled as usual to-day & three men killed.
