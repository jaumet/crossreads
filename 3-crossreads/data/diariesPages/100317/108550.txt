very close to knocking his place out. Then to Sparrow and found him asleep and then on to see Harricks. Put him in charge of the raid arrangements came back to H.Q. for lunch. There was nothing doing in the afternoon or early evening. Relief of 7th Bde passed at 10 p.m. for up forward. Just outside a 5.9 killed 2 and wounded 6 others. One died at our door. Sent out a stretcher party and brought them in. MacMahon, our doctor, was busy dressing them and making them comfortable. Some were badly hit and making noise as much from shock as from anything else. After we had got rid of them there was no further excitement. Everything on the front continued very quiet until near midnight when our guns went on to their nightly work of counterpreparation
