  
 45 We arrived at Rubempre safely on the 5th & left again on the 8th. 
 The night before leaving three of us arranged an impromptu moonlight excursion into the country. All the heads were well out of the way so we commandeered the Napier Car & set-off. The party consisted of Jim Lean (Driver) Art Mitchell (Cook) & myself, a merry party & ready for anything. We soon boarded all untensils & eatables, also a box broken up into portable peices, as firewood is very scarce in these parts. When a tree is felled every chip is picked up. 
 Well we were soon whizzing out into the country & drove across a field (wheat)
