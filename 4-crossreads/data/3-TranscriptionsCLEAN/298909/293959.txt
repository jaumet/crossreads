  
 This is only one instance of M.O. indifference or callousness. 
 19/4/16  Wednesday 
 Very cold last night - Very fair day. 
 Corporal of a Picquet all day. Rumours that there is heavy fighting on the Canal. A lot of men are moving off. We heard that owing to the delay in leaving Zeitoun Camp - my name was called at Telekebar for Artillery & not being there to answer it was crossed out.   Needless to say I am very disappointed. This is a very large Camp. I think I would be right in saying it is 5 miles long - so it is hard to imagine unless you see it what numbers of men are in Calico City - They style this Camp third line of Defence - Rumours of a lot of casualtys amongst Australians in France - also that no more transfers from A.M.C will be considered. 
 The Flying Squadron alongside us - condescended to give us an evenings music on the Band, we all appreciated & broke the monotony.
