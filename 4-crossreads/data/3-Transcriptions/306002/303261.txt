<p>24.8.15<br/>would have been enteric fever if they had not been inoculated.  Between 20 &amp; 30 men are sent away from the 1st L.H. Bde. every day &amp; the Lensters average a good many more than this.  At Major Glasgows request only 50 men of the 1st L.H. went onto Popes Hill to-day &amp; 40 2nd L.H. came out, all that came out <strike>ver</strike> were sick &amp; they look a sorry lot some of them can hardly walk, a large mail came in to-day.  Stan's long delayed parcel came along with this mail, also a parcel of cigarettes &amp; Tobacco from Edie, we now have more writing material than we know what to do with.  Fighting seems a thing of the past just at this particular spot but things are lively both to the North &amp; South of us, a dry thunderstorm came over us this afternoon but no rain.</p>
