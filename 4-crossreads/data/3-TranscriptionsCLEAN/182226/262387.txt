  
 Friday 31 December, 1915 
 Went into Valletta, De Mattos & Sheen, two friends of mine managed to get a few shillings which was nearly all spent. 
 Coming home we met two nurses & took them home to St Patrick's Hospital. 
 Were too tired to see the New Year in so we went to bed at 11.30. 
   
 Turn to January 1 st  in front for continuation.
