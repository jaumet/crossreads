<p>the last troops to leave Anzac.  It sounds all right now Mother, it made us straighten our backs there.  At 2 oclock a.m. the 9 men and Cap White came in from the left &amp; then &ndash; our No 1 outpost-position &ndash; &amp; Walker's were the last 2 trenches manned.</p>
<p>The last hour dragged a bit, but at last about &frac14; past 3, we got the order, to get away &ndash; Just as we were filing out, they blew up Walkers &amp; a big gun.  Of course the Turks thought, something was up, &amp; started firing = that was all right, as long as they fired, they were not charging &ndash; so we jogged off down the sap.  The Turks were doing rapid fire at empty trenches all the time.</p>
<p>There was not one stop, we went straight to the beach, &amp; out on to a punt, and in no time were heading for a transport.  It was wonderfully managed, everyone got off, only 3 casualities, and they were, from stray shots &ndash; it was a fine piece of work getting us off safely &ndash; it was sheer hide &amp; bluff that got us through.  The Turks never thought we would attempt such a thing.  If we had posted up notices</p>
