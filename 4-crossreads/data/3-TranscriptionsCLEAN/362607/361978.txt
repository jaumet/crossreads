  
 Bulford 7.10.17 Dear George, Another view of lovely Bournemouth. Every sea side Resort has its Tower Clock on the Pier Head. You will see the Tower at the Bottom of the Cliff. I took a snap of the Pier from the Rail where you see the man Walking, but I do not know how it will turn out yet. I had a swim & went out for a row for a couple of Hours. Winter is on us again. I did not ride to Salisbury. I could have had no hear, hands or toes left if I had done so. This place is not a bit bigger than Manly but it has a dozen Hotels like the Pacific  but surrounded by lovely gardens & lawns & Tennis lawns etc. Electric & Cable Trams to all the surrounding Districts too. Shops as big as Whites & Stewarts put together. Well, George there is no news at all. This is only to let you Know that we are both doing well. Regirds to all the Boys & to all our Friends round about.  Your loving Brother  Harry
