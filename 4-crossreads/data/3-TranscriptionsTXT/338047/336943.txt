1919Janyout on the floor with a girl, so tried it out on my own with some of the other mugs in the room adjoining where we could hear the music. A Picture show was started in a bottle factory down the road.  The place had been used by Fritz as a theatre, & the stage & seats were all fixed up.  Those who were running the show got hold of a dynamo & a steam engine (originally Fritz's) & set them up.
Feb 4On 4 Feb I obtained leave to visit Charleroi.  I caught a leave bus at Batt. H.Q. at 9 am & did the 45 kilos in it.  We arrived at Charleroi about 12.30 pm & I went round to the YM for a feed.  (Extract from letter 12. 8.2.19)Things are terribly dear here.  At the YM it cost 1 franc for  a cup of coffee & 3 cakes.  In the shops - 1d bars of chocolate are 1 franc, boots - 100 francs & everything else in proportion.  After lunch I walked around the market place looking at the stalls & cheap jacks.  One man was running pins & needles into himself, but he couldn't get an audience.
