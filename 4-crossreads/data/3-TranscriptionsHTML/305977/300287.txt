<p>had no sun.  Our guns opened up a lively bombardment on Thursday morning &amp; there was a great roar for an hour or so.  I received 2 parcels from mother, one of which contained a muffler &amp; sox.  On Friday we removed out on to the extreme right &amp; now have to man Wilson's Outlook our furthest outpost where there is a fair bit of bomb fighting &amp; which is constantly shelled every day.  By day we improve the trenches.  Saturday was a very cold day &amp; the ground was wet slippery from the day before.  Was out at Wilson's Outlook at night &amp; it was the worst night I ever experienced since joining.  It came on  to snow about 11 pm &amp; we had nowhere to sleep.  At 8 am we came out &amp; had breakfast &amp; after that turned in.  It snowed nearly all day Sunday &amp; it was bitterly cold &amp; windy at night.</p>
<p>Monday 29th to Sunday 5th Decr<br/>The snow ceased Sunday night, but Monday was a freezing day in</p>
