<p>casualties &amp; damage to our trenches.  Just below our camp there is a notice board &amp; while Sap Lalor was reading some orders on it a shell land a few ft from him lifting him about 20 ft &amp; landing him through a blanket roof on a Q.M's Store onto the floor some 8' below.  He was rather badly wounded but it is thought that he will get over it alright.</p>
<p>17th<br/>Fairly heavy bombardment this afternoon more casualties &amp; damage to our trenches.  Our Artillery is doing good work.</p>
<p>18th<br/>As usual on the Sabbath as much work as usual.  Nothing of interest.</p>
<p>19th<br/>A good deal of shelling from Enemy doing some damage to our trenches causing some casualties.  Our Artillery replied I believe with good effect.</p>
<p>20th<br/>Fairly heavy shelling from Enemy early in morning &amp; again in the afternoon.  Our Artillery was fairly active too &amp; appeared to be getting well into the enemy's trenches.  Usual exchange of rifle fire and bombs.</p>
<p>21st<br/>Nothing fresh today except that our Artillery put in more than usual.</p>
<p>22nd<br/>It is thought highly probable that the enemy will make an attack tonight &amp; every precaution is being taken to give them a warm reception.  Our Howitzers gave them a particularly warm time today.</p>
<p>23rd<br/>The expected attack did not eventuate last night.  Every preparation had been made to give them a warm reception but beyond that a good deal of firing about 1.30 a.m. nothing occurred but Artillery is busy again today &amp; the enemy has put in a good deal too this afternoon &amp; also fired some very heavy bombs.  One shell 75mm fell amongst our dugouts but luckily did no damage as it did not explode.</p>
