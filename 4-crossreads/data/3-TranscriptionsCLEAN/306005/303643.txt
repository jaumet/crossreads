13-13-16Wed 13thI received orders this morning that the 8th Royal Scots were to connect on to our line as they are well digging between us & Bde. I took a ride to Bde just before dinner & camped at the Scotties camp on my way back & found they had connected on to the 127th Brigade line as it ran right by their Camp. Tomorrow is to be a big Field day & we expect to see something interesting here; Major Smith in charge of a Troop from C Sqdn is going to El Arish tonight with Engineers to try again to find water, he took his 3 Sigs with him & expects to be away 48 hours. I was given 3 more supernumeries from A Sqdn today.
