 9/8 /19 Durban My impress is that civil must be good for these peopl as their nativ condit is littl abov that of brute . Civil , howev bad , could hard still further debas them . At 4.30 we caught a train back onc more notic the jungl , some monkey in the tree and the sugar cane plantat . In general the dull colour of the landscap is much like Australia . Visit the fine Durban Club and then dine and wine at Twine Hotel . The shop along Durban street are verandah in Aust . Fashion . Visit nativ market again and found them all close . The mosqu lit up tonight . Coal still in full swing at the boat but no sail till Monday .
