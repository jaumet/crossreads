<p>night.&nbsp;It was on this occassion that I bought several presents to send home.&nbsp;On 28th&nbsp;did my first shooting with Lewis gun on the range and did fairly well.&nbsp;29th my feet were very bad so I paraded sick and was evacuated and taken by motor to 36th casualty clearning station at Heilly. Here I was attended to and put in a marque to sleep on a stretcher.&nbsp;Once you are given your quarters you are directed to the mess room</p>
