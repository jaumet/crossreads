<p>We are still uncertain of our movements;   no one seems to have any definite information to offer as to when or where we go.   The air is of course thick with rumours, but I do not pay much heed to anything unofficial.   I have just purchased a helmet &amp; find it a great protection from the sun.   I don't think the Luxor trip could be done without a helmet.   The mosquitoes are just eating me up in spite of tobacco smoke &amp; the smoke from a heap of gum leaves that I have been burning in the tent (we have gums galore here) so I must end up this epistle &amp; crawl; in under the shelter of your indispensable mosquito nets.   Au revoir old girl with best love to all &amp; hoping you are all happy &amp; well,<br/>Yr loving husband<br/>Will.<br/>I enclose photos of two of the Cairo mosques.<br/>W.H.R.</p>
