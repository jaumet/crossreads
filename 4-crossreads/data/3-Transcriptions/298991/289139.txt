<p>Friday February 2nd<br/>Owing to the kitchen being shifted this afternoon everything was head over heels. Everything was very quiet during the day. A German airoplane came over this evening &amp; dropped two bombs not too far away, close engh for my liking.</p>
<p>Saturday February 3rd<br/>Had a quiet morning, but was kept exceptionally busy this evening. We put through about seventy patients in about two hours, including 22 Scoties. There were four of the Scoties severly &amp; dangerously wounded, it appears that two Coys were carrying "Mills bombs" in sand back, when the pin came out of a bomb &amp; set the rest off. One was blown to pieces (he was due for a months furlough tomorrow through long service). The weather is getting much warmer, &amp; the starlings are <strike>beginning to</strike> arriving here in mobs too, a good sign of spring. There was a concert &amp; a bit of a cinema held in the recreation hut tonight. I did not go.</p>
<p>Sunday February 4th<br/>Each day that passes spring is noticeably coming very quick. Rather quiet all day. All stretcher cases (wounded) go right on to the Casualty clearing station, both by Railway &amp; motor, this means less work for us C section of this ambulance &amp; four out of a section had to go up to the Advance dressing station as reserve bearers for the stunt tonight. The 13th Battalion went over at 9 pm &amp; took their objective. The prisoners are said to have given themselves up very easily, some even had their blankets &amp; overcoats rolled waiting to go over &amp; meet our fellows to give themselves up, they declared they knew we were going to have a pop over, but did not know the time, &amp; that they were utterly sick of the war, in all about 250 prisoners were taken. Both the 13th &amp; 14th Battalions lost heavily through the German shell fire. Keeping very cold. Shifted into another tent in the opposite corner of the camp very convenient place.</p>
