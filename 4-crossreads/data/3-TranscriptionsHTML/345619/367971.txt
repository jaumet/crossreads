<p>[New letter written on YMCA paper.  At the top of each page is printed "In the Field" and Burrowes has added the word NOT so it now reads NOT In the Field]<br/>27-10-1918</p>
<p>Dearest Woof<br/>I have been very glad to get some letters from you lately, and today a parcel came that Mum said was from Frank, but had a washer in from Frank, and one from you, thank you very much for it, they will both be nice when I am having a bath, and also when I have a wash, as I only have one leg to stand on, and It is hard to wash</p>
