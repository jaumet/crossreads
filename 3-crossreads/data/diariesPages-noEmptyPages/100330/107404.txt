The place was crowded a good programme was presented including a Charlie Chaplin Film, a very laughable one after coming out I went along for the Colours Fritz started shelling the Town, while I was waiting in the shop the Lady in charge went along to get some milk into a building while she was coming back a Shell burst close by some Bricks Mortar fell on her injuring her severely, some Australians handy rendered First Aid summoned the Motor Ambulance she was taken to the Civilian Hospital in Proven a few miles away. After seeing the Lady in the Car having my colours I left came back to Camp.
