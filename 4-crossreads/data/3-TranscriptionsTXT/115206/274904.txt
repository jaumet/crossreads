 Wembley. Bristol and Wembley Oh! What a life. Travelled up town caught 12.7 pm for Bristol, returned after a wild goose chase, to Wembley, per District tram and boot. Arrived home at 1 am quite a respectable hour, and felt absolutely exhausted. After such a tiring day. Wondering whether old Smithy got a bad. I hope he did.
