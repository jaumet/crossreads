 PALESTINE, KHAN YUNAS 
 Clive Weston is my Quarter-master Sergeant  it is hard to keep him sober & the day will come when he will be broken. I have wet-nursed him for his family's sake. The old REG. arrived here.   Enemy bombed our arrival. 
 Left the sand & the Desert. Country here good. Barley crops & wild RYE, CROWFOOT, OAT GRASS LAMBS TONGUE, MUSTARD, COUCH GRASS, & VETCHES, with QUAIL among it. 
 Enemy here. He occupied SHELLAL & we shall fight him 3 days or so, so it is rumoured. Flowers everywhere, fields of POPPIES, DAISYS, etc. it is springtime here. I reckon good sheep proposition or Meat country.
