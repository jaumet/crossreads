<p>There are a great many frogs to be seen about here. They spring up from around ones feet in all directions.</p>
<p>August 15th. Thurs.<br/>The feast of St Marie is being celebrated to-day. The people are going about in holiday attire and the church bells are ringing at various intervals during the day.</p>
<p>August 16th. Fri<br/>Walked round by Neuf Berquin in the afternoon and in the evening went round by Stenwerck. Passed a very tall crucifix surrounded by tall trees.</p>

<p>French civilians are making a practise of coming to the C.C.S. to have dressings and wounds attended to, much to the annoyance of the M.O.'s.</p>
<p>Aug 20th. Sun.<br/>A raid took place and the men who went over did not find anyone in the trenches but on their return to their own trenches they were shelled and had a good number of casualties.</p>
<p>Fritz is becoming wide awake to these raids now-a-days. When there is a raid on he is clearing back from that part of the line, and when the raider returning to there own trenches he lets them have it with a vengeance.</p>
<p>There seems to be more losses than gains in these raids</p>
