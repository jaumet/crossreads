<p>9.1.18<br/>Route March again as part of training.  Section Officers reporting great improvement in general march discipline.<br/>Instructions received from Division that Corps Circular regarding protection of huts against bombs was to be carried into effect.  Indent for necessary material submitted and general survey of the camp made with the idea of fitting the work into existing trench.  The Corps Circular referred to required a 2'6" wall with a 4' clearance between wall and trench, supplying earth for same.  It was decided that the best method of construction would be a wall completely encircling the main group of huts as the space between would make a wall between them useless.</p>
