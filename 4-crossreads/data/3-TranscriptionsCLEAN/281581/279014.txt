  
 conception of a Palestine village. Its streets are mere typical alleyways, dirty, dingy and smelly, here and there arched over by a building, and very similar to Jerusalem. 
 Johnson my indispensable batman who swears and speaks amazing Arabic, kept the army of small boys which followed, in our wake, at peeping distance. There is quite a fine Greek church erected to St.George, and its interior IS a remarkable display of tawdreness and show. After taking a series of pictures we returned to Dieran.  We stopped at the old Crusader tower at Ramleh on the homeward journey, from where there is a transcending outlook over the country.  The run through the budding orchards, lit by the low evening sun to Dieran is always fresh and pleasant. I exposed 20 plates and took 600 feet Cinema film.
