<p>Later &ndash; Received Belle's letter of June 12th, a few hours ago. Pleased to hear you have got the "Anzac" Paper alright. Dont you think it very clever? One copy is for Eddy &amp; one to keep for me please. I'm very well &amp; as happy as it is possible under the circumstances, if I could only be in England or France &amp; know how my boy is doing, it would be much better. Suppose I shall get a letter in a couple of days if he is alright. I wish I could see you all &amp; have a good talk about things but letter writing is very unsatisfactory. Dear old mother's birthday is passed &amp; I was thinking of her &amp; just picturing the morning &ndash; greetings &amp; excitement. Hope Jess is all the better for her rest &amp; that she had a happy time with you all. We shall have to teach Eddy to <u>Salute</u> went we return. (Jackson &amp; I.) One never knows, I may want to life at home always &ndash;</p>
