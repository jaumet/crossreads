29.4.15Thur. 29th.  Mounted parade & went to the junction of the canal, had a sleep there at dinner time & were back in camp early.  After tea Arthur Welch came over & we went to Heliopolis, & saw a Red Cross train come in loaded with wounded Australians "mostly the 10th Btn.", they were as pleased as punch & were mostly wounded on the legs & arms.  They were fighting Sunday morning last & done some good work.  The 9th Btn. of infantry were cut up only 23 men & 3 officers answering the roll call.  Returned to camp at 10 oclock very interesting time.
