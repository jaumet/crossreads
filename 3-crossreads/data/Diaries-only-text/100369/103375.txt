go along and becoming very fertile and beautiful. Fruit growing in abundance, peach, fig, oranges, lemons, etc. and each place has an almost complete irrigation system of it own. Water is procured at various depths almost anywhere. The wells are generally sunk on the top of a hill which means of course an extra depth, but also assures easy irrigation of the slopes surrounding it on which are the orchards. 
The water is drawn in most cases in wooden buckets on an endless chain. On the horizontal beam on which the buckets run is placed a huge double wooden wheel connected with rungs (like a circular ladder) at intervals of about 15 inches. The end of the windlass beam is secured to a substantial cross beam, supported on rough masonry at either end. Underneath it another large beam (all of them are a foot or 15 inches in diameter) is half buried in the ground and secured by the masonry. Into these two cross beams, top and bottom, circular holes are cut, into which an upright is fixed as an axle, on which is fastened a wheel similar in size to the double one on the windlass beam, but single, and fitted with spokes instead of rungs. A long wooden lever is also secured to the upright, to which a camel is attached
