<p>You have to climb up a little way to get to the opening which is only a small hole and then you go in a long way through a narrow passage and you have to double right up.<br/>After a bit you get to a wall which is very high and narrow, the guide lit some magnesium wire to show me (and made me pay 2 1/2 Pts.) then we started to climb up a narrow passage of polished marble, as slippery as glass, you have got to hold the guide's hand and you feel you want to wash yours for a week afterwards.<br/>When you get near the end of the passage you it gets bigger and you can see where mummies we taken out of the walls and then you go through a narrow passage again to the Kings chamber.  His name is up on the wall just before you go into the passage.<br/>The kings chamber is right in the centre of the Pyramid and is a tremendously high and big place, the guide lit some more magnesium to show me (another 2 &frac12; P).<br/>The ventilation is the wonderful thing &ndash; the air is quite fresh in there and there is a passage for it to come it on the other side from where we came.  The guide explained to me how it worked but I could not understand him.<br/>In the middle there is a big stone vault where the king's mummie was. There are tremendous big granite stones in the walls of this chamber; there is no mortor between them and one tremendous stone runs right along one wall and they say weighs 40 tons.<br/>over</p>
<p>P.S.<br/>Will you send my sub for the Fortian.<br/>You are supposed to pay in advance &amp; I think I owe for last year but it is only 1/6 a year.  I would like to have it sent to me just to see the list of chaps who have come.  Mr Yarnold sent me his paper before I left. I suppose I ought to subscribe to it, that's 1/- a year I think.<br/>I expect that he would like my name for the list too.<br/>The boys &amp; Aunt Katie might like to hear about the Pyramids &amp; I could not write another account so you can send them this if you like.</p>
