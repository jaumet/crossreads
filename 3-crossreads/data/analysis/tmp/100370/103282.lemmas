 who , by their courag and cheer sacrific , carri the day . We did not get an opportun of see the citi except from a distanc . In the morn we move on again . By the side of the road as we journey we saw the shatter remnant of a tank , a mute wit to the fierc of the fight here on that ill-fat 19th April . That even saw us at Belah , and the next morn we start for Rafa , reach it about 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 22nd . Here we are to stay for an indefinit period . Feb. 7th 1919 The old year is gone , and the second month of the new is on it way , and we are still here at Rafa . But we will not be long now . It is pretti certain that we move from here for Kantara about the 19th and the first or second week in March we should sail for dear old " Aussie" . That will be a glorious day . It will be worth all the hardship and struggl of the past few year to know one is homeward bound .
