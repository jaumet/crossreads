When first I returned from Egypt your Red + Committee here & people asked me to address this meetings, I felt that I could not - I am not used to speaking in public & as I lived a private life in Egypt I was afraid my personal reminiscences might not be of sufficient interest to strangers - however the President Committee pointed out to me I realized that anything connected with Egypt would be of interest & as my husband & only brother were there & I know how keen I was in finding out about them & how little I could find out before I went there so I felt feel it my duty to do my best to tell others the little I know of Egypt.  come tonight & tell you about it  For who is there out here who has not some dear one over there?We arrived in Egypt on May 10th & left Pt. Said the following day for Cairo at noon.  The distance is 148 miles, 5 hrs.  The train line runs parallel to the Canal as far as Ismalieyeh.
