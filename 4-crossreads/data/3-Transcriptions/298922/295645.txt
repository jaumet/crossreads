<p>Wednesday 12 December 1917</p>
<p>Calm &amp; smooth, only 2 steamers in convoy we are never lonely with small escort &ndash; my 3 weeks leave in England has run into a long space. RATS are plentiful &amp; the Goanese get <u>a bonus</u> for all they kill each day. Goanese are really Portugese settled on an island near India. <strike>As soldiers they are not worth much altho' our allies.</strike></p>
