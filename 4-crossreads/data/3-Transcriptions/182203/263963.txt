<p>only done 4 hrs in hospital. Suppose Dorothy  &amp; I shall be on Duty next week. We have had a number of cases in hospital    &amp;  the Major was saying that a number of the poor fellows would have had pneumonia  &amp; most likely died, if they had not been nursed. We had two very bad pneumonias last week but they are going on splendidly now &amp; shall go on with us. The others are mostly influenza &amp;  suffering from Vaccination. <br/>We had a lecture from the Chaplin on General French last week but could not hear him very well &ndash; one thing we heard was General French &amp;  John Wesley. how they came together I cannot see. Oh, the old chaps name is Rowe, he was the minister of Perth. W.A. church &amp; built all those buildings that made the ground so valuable, so he says. He knew the Harmers &amp; said dear old Mrs Harmer was a "Saintly Woman." I did say her son had married my sister. He is an awful old   <u>Woser</u>.</p>
