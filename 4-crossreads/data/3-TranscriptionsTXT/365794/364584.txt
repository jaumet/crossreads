 Monday 1st July 1917 [1918] All Beila nurses on duty &amp; once again "Willow".  S. Moore &amp; I are working in same hospital.  Jealousy will soon be rife if any promotions come up. Miss Cheetham promises my V.A.D. may stay but S. Allardice is poor style to help, sits around etc., these women are more friendly than the British but wish they would not burst into our bedroom, etc., &amp; would be a little more stiff sometimes.
