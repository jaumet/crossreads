<p>morning. Part of the journey was over lovely roads then we reached the desert &amp; ploghed through deep sand. On arriving at camp we had tinned fish issued then turned in for a few hours sleep. It was very cold &amp; we all felt it at first.</p>
<p>Wednesday We were placed in one of the messing sheds.. Having no rations issued we went to the canteen &amp; after struggling for half an hour managed to get some bacon &amp; eggs fried in olive oil for 3 piastres equal to  7&frac12;d. After that I had a bad time. A terrible headache came on and lasted till the afternoon. The Doctor not arriving I decided to see Cairo so went off about 5 oclock by tram a distance of about 3 miles from Abbassich camp where we were situated. Picking up some chap who had been here sometime I saw <u>things</u>. It seems to me impossible to find a worse city for open vice. Soliciting goes on in the open street. In doorways, a few yards apart there would be several standing about surrounded by soldiers. From balconies they hung over &amp; called to passerby &amp; soldiers could be seen through the windows. Then passing up narrow alleyways we saw hundreds of such sights. Dancing exhibitions to be seen from P&frac12; upwards. Then dotted here &amp; there are drinking shops combined with a Vaudeville show. No charge to enter. Some turns fair others quite impossible. We had quite a good fish supper for P.6 &amp; returned to camp about 10 P.M.</p>
<p>Thursday 25th. Decided to find out where our corps. was encamped so walked to the next camp about 3 miles off, Heleopolis by name but found the 4th, Field Amb there. Then thinking to find Lance</p>
