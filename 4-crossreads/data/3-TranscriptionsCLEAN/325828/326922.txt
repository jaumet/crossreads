 My loved ones at Home, Since my last letter of 16th inst to Father, I have had your two letters of 19th & 26th of March for which I thank you very much.  I received them 2 days after I wrote- just too late to be able to answer them.  I have also received the package of films that you sent Father dear, but as we have had to hand all cameras in they will have to be put away until some future date.  Your other birthday parcel also came to hand 2 days ago.  Thanks to the splendid packing of it it reached me in first-class condition.  Thank you all so very much for all your loving kindness to me & good wishes Probably due to the air, & perhaps salt air getting in to them, the Tin of Griffith's chocolates were quite crumbly at the slightest touch.  The mere touching of them in taking the outside paper off was enough to break them in crumbs, but the flavour wasn't affected at all & they were very acceptable All of the presents were very useful indeed, & I do indeed thank you all for them. By the same mail there was another parcel for me addressed to my right number & name
