<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left the money where it was; but I thought as it was out in orders I was pretty sure of getting away with him.  I am sorry Father dear that you should have been troubled about it &amp; then my not require it after all.<br/>Rid &amp; I have had several talks about my getting with him as <u>his</u> batman; I am not sure whether the exchange could be effected; but I am inclined to let matters stand as they are for the present for <u>2</u> reasons.  I am at present only <u>attached</u> to D.H.Q. and so long as I am only attached I draw my Driver's pay, but as soon as I am <u>transferred</u> to D.H.Q I drop the extra 1/- per day.  This 1/- a day is not to be despised these days, &amp; of course if I was transferred to the Artillery I would drop it straight off; as in that Unit, Gunners <u>only</u>, &amp; not drivers are allowed to be Officer's orderlies.  I have no idea how long I would be <u>attached,</u>  as some men have been attached for close on 12 months.  What I propose is this:- let things stand as they are at present; as soon as I am transferred to D.H.Q Strength apply for a transfer to Rid's lot.</p>
