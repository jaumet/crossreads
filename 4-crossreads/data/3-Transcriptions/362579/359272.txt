<p>We are hoping three of us get it together, we shall go to Blighty (England)   &amp;  stay at the Ivanhoe Hotel where most of the Aust. Sisters stay. Only get about 12 days, so cannot say if I shall be able to visit any of the counties, shall have a try.</p>
<p>Be sure to address my letters in future to C/- Miss Conyers. My movements are so uncertain.</p>
<p>There is nothing to write about this week, have not been into Doullens, so no p.cards to send Eddy. Hope that darling is better   &amp;  keeping stronger. I must try to send him something from England.</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
