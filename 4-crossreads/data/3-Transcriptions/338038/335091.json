<p>too solid here. As a matter of fact this Camp, (Mena) has been condemned for Summer use, and all the remaining troops must be out of here by the end of April. I fully expect Alexandria will be made the base for all troops not going on immediately. There are several good camps there, namely Chatby &amp; San Stefano which are right on the sea front and quite cool.<br/>We have lost Richards from our section, he has been transferred to 3rd F.A. Brigade as Orderly Officer to Colonel Rosenthal. His place has been filled by a Captain Webb, from Queensland who came over with Reinforcements. Sorry to lose Richards but the newcomer seems a good sort. Parker has arrived and has been posted to No.3 Section under Captain Madden.<br/>I have this week posted home my photograph album and also a small box of cigarettes for Pat. The<br/>II</p>
