<p>[13 February 1916]</p>
<p>1.30 A.M. "SAMALUT"<br/>We got a surprise start yesterday morning at  5 A.M. orders came that the Natives had been firing on the Train from <strike>LUXOR</strike> so the whole Brigade was ordered to entrain by midday.  Here we are now <u>South</u> of Cairo instead of going North to Mersa Matrue on the Mediteranean  I am glad as the Coast air never agrees with me<br/>X <strike>The Powers that be never seem to learn much </strike>X  We are carting about great wooden Troughs for Watering the Horses, not collapsible with bands as we use in Australia at the Wells- Then the Head Ropes are always eaten by the Horses- We know that Tarring saves them yet cannot get it for love or money.<br/><u>"Here endeth the growl."</u></p>
