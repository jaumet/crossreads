 Have just done a 24 hours picquet in a large evacuated town &amp; have also had our much appreciated bath &amp; are now dwelling on a pay then we will be set.  I had a very nice letter from Daisy a few days ago, I am enclosing it for you to see.  I also heard from Arthur a few days ago, he is still well, has been transferred to the 35 Batt., reasons I dont know.  I have not heard from Bertie lately, I expect Ken is visiting them all by now &amp; having the time of his life, lucky dorg.  There is no leave to Blighty these days
