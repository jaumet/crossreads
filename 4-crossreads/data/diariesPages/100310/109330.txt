Billjim
After Bullecourt a private of the French Mortars was transferred to us for this reason. In the action a German was calling out to be killed and so be put out of agony. This chap obligingly despatched him with a clasp knife. What they really objected to though was his cutting off the finger of a Hun officer because there was a good ring on it. The gentleman was not quite dead. This chap should go far in this battalion!!

Our bombardment is said to be so hot that many Huns have gone mad under it. Late one night a half screwed lanky Billjim presented himself to the R.T.O Aveling ? an English officer ? with what was palpably a faked order for beer. "Please give bearer a petrol tin of beer. Lieut. H.S.Wank." The R.T.O said "Do you think I came down in the last shower! Even if you did have an officer called Wank he would sign Lieut after his name and not before!" Billjim:- "Now Sir you see its this way ? our officers ain't as well educated as you Tommies". Tom:- Jack was funny last night. He says this is Russian beer. I says "yer mad it's French beer. He says "It is Russian beer- it rushes through yer!!"
