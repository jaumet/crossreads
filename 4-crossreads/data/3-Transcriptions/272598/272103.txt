<p>La-Gourge in the evening &amp; for the first time I had the pleasure of hearing a fife &amp; drum band.</p>
<p>Saturday 16.9.16<br/>Much cooler than usual.  Walked to Merville during afternoon, about 6 Kilos &amp; returned through Neuf Berquin about 7&frac12; Kilos; long but pleasant walk.  Distribution of honors took place at Merville just prior to our arrival, consequently the town was full of military men of high rank, also a good number of men who had received honors.  Met five Tommies who had received the Military Medal; they were 5 of 27 who came back from an attack made by 670 on the Somme on July 1st last.</p>
