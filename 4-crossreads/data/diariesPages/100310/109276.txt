Close order training during the morning. Had a talk with Major Watson of Divnl. Signal Coy and the one and only Henry Crowther. At lunch time we had some sandwiches and ate sitting in the long grass. The air today was remarkable clear and distant objects appeared very close to hand. In the afternoon went for a route march via Blendecques ?Arques but Rodda had made a miscalculation in estimating the distance and we landed home too early. Perforce had to order an inspection of feet to fill in time. Rumour that we remain here for another three weeks. Some shells were landing into Hazebrouck during the afternoon and a Taube was flying over Blendeques.

Uneventful. Usual close order work on parade ground. Afternoon half holiday. Hay fever and plenty of work to do. Resolved to put the acid on at the Orderly Rooms for a while as Drunks and A.W.L. are getting too frequent. Leniency does not pay.
