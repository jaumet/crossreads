<p>in this Diary only applies to the lower cast of Egyptian. An Egyptian funeral is also a very noisy affair. Spent usual pleasant evening.<br/>Wednesday August 8th<br/>Went into Cairo on a round of visits to various Mosques. Inspected one which we were told was 3750 yrs old. We saw the vaults, gardens and the roof &amp; some of the walks were inlaid with Gold &amp; Carvings. One place was shown us by Guide which consisted of an air tight room where prisoners were shut in &amp; smothered &amp; then on being taken out were thrown down well into Nile. We also visited Mohammed Assan Mohammed Ali &amp; Blue Tiled Mosque. All of them possessed luxurious Carpets, windows of coloured Glass beautifully matched &amp; massive Marble pillars</p>
