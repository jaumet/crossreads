<p>Hubert Harris [killed Gallipoli 31/7/15] position since he was killed. It is very sultry to-day and looks like a storm. Yesterday it also blew up like a storm and we had a sprinkle of rain only. If we get anything like a rainy season here we shall really be in for a bad time. It is quiet today except for Beachy Bills sending a shell over occasionally &amp; a rifle Bullet cracking here &amp; there. Lower down where the new Division landed the Cruisers are sending a few broadsides ashore. The outlook on to the water looks very dull owing to the threatening state of the weather. Sergeant Turton went away today.</p>
