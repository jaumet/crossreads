<p>&amp; one could not help noticing the swarms of rats that infest the ruined city, save for the echoing footsteps she is as silent as the grave &amp; reminds one of a city that has been overun by a big fire, nearly all the buildings have the interior burnt completely out &amp; only the walls are left standing &amp; they all show great gaping holes where the shells have ploughed through, there are 4 buildings in there that one must notice, the first is the ruins of the lovely "Cloth Hall" the next the Catherdal which has only the front &amp; walls left standing &amp; they have got quite a startling lean on them</p>
