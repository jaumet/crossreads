Our plans bye-the-way were far from completion as all we had obtained from the German girls so far had been a map giving details of the roads of the country between us and Holland &#126; so with the hope of getting more particulars we resolved on visiting them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Our sentries, who were posted indoors, counted us before "lights out" and didn't worry us until the time came for "up stand" as they used to call it - otherwise "reveille".
