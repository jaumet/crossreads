Had a good dinner, then went on deck. We were taken to the hospital  & it is wonderfully fitted up for a    hos ship hospital. The matron is a charming woman. &  we all love her & wish she were to be always with us.The other nurses uniforms are not nearly so well made as ours, & the indoor dresses are not all one color, some are grey, much lighter than ours, & some are almost blue. Matron is very annoyed about it. They are a very noisy crowd from Sydney but the New Zealand ones are very nice & we all think will get on very well.Slept soundly all night, up at 7.15. a.m.  Breakfast at 8.30.p.m.  &  am up on deck now. Will add more later on. Am feeling splendid enjoying every meal, it is very calm. Sister Newton is very well today  &  gave us a great treat with singing    &  playing this afternoon. Cannot say where we are but send letters to Sister Thistlethwaite   1st Aust. Gen. Hosp.   Egypt. Hope you are all well  & happy. I am feeling splendid  & sleeping soundly. Fondest love  &  kisses. From your loving daughter.Edith
