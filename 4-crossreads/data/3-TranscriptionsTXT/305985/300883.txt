 THE H.Q. SIGS  DR 
 Id like to tell you all about the H.Q.Sigs. DR. Theres only twelve of them just now but yes by jove they are the finest lot of sigs you know and capable my word.

 Now lets take Sol the corporal we'll put him first cos he is just the man who is in charge and busy as can be He does not take a watch at all well damn it all you know you cant expect it of a man who runs the blooming show. He gets your tucker and your drink  I saw him once bring up an egg and one whole tin of milk and mix them in his  sup.
