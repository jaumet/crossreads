curses of those who have been doing their share, but I will let them go.   They are a crawling lot of Back Street Sergeants and Corporals with a sprinkling of stars amongst them.   When out on Furlough I was in London for a couple of days but did not see much of the city.   I was on my own all the time, as none of my mates that I was with in France and Egypt are here.   I met a couple of Boys I knew in London.  one was on his way to Scotland, on Furlough and the other had only just arrived in London.  I left London on Saturday night just as the Zepps were getting busy    I did not see any of the Searchlights, or hear the guns, but I saw a few people nearly running mad in their hurry to leave London and escape The Zepps.   one woman charged down the Platform and got into a Manchester carriage.   Then out of that, when told where it was going, declaring that she would go somewhere.   She would not stay in London to be blown up.   When the train arrived at Brum. I had a look out it was about 3 A.M. and cold and foggy so I stayed where I was at Stafford.   I was supposed to change trains
