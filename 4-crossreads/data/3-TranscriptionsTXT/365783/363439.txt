 Mena 13.4.15. Dearest old Mrs, Your letter of 1.4.15. arrived yesterday &ndash; glad to hear you received stockings etc all right. I was in Town yesterday &amp; on my return found your cable on my pillow "Overland almost impossible prefer Bibby liner Warwickshire leaving Liverpool April twenty ninth to other lines cable yes or no"   This morning I sent you cable "People here say no difficulty crossing France enquire fully &amp; decide yourself welcome"   While in Town yesterday &amp; before getting your cable I made enquiries at various shipping offices &amp; from some people at the Continental who had heard of others who had recently come across France I judged from these enquiries that there would probably be no difficulty in getting across France &amp; for the reasons stated in my last letter I regard this as quite safe.    I presume from your cable that you made enquiries &amp; that you considered that the overland route was almost impossible &amp; that the trip by the Warwickshire would be quite safe.   My further cable of to-day was just to show you what I had learnt &amp; to emphasize that I would much prefer you to come across France.
