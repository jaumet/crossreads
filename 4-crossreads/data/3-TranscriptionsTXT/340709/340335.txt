The "Sumatra" has been requisitioned by our people and is to be utilised as a patrol steamer. She will be armed with a 12pr & a maxim gun. The steam yacht previously mentioned is also to be armed (3pr Hotchkiss & a maxim). The "Berrima" is constantly crowded with niggers all engaged in some way or other, either as porters of in some similar capacity. Our men have taken a great fancy to them and load them up with all kinds of trinkets and goods. It is no uncommon thing to see them with a cambric flag (Union Jack or Red Ensign) across their shoulders & the lid of a tobacco tin fastened thereon. Some, however, are more elaborately decorated, being decked in a red sarong and a Jack-tan cap with HMAS AUSTRALIA on the ribbon. Give a nigger a twist of tobacco, a trinket & a bit of Kai-Kai (tucker) and he will work till he drops.I have mentioned previously that Lt M--- refers to the Naval Reserve as the "Panto Navy", but for the quintessence of opera bouffe nothing can equal Rabaul.

With the "Australia", "Sydney" & "Melbourne" away, the AE1 lost, & the "Yarra" practically a non-entity we are in some trepidation lest "Our Island" should be again wrested from us. We are to coal tomorrow; accordingly we are looking forward to a dirty day.(See opposite page)
