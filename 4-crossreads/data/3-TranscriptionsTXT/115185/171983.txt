  2 &nbsp;by me in Egypt but I&#39;m too stupid to write tonight. Col Jamieson looks splendid. it will be nice to have him near me for a bit____ 
 A number of sisters are going back on transport duty and I shall send a packet of letters with a trustworthy one for you &amp; Father to read &amp; keep for me. I cant carry them round. The girls are very interesting and a few from active service men though short, give impressions of the trenches etc at Gallipoli. I shall also try and write a decent letter to send you. I received no letters from you by the mail which left Sydney about 27th Feb. &nbsp;about the time our troops played&nbsp;up a Liverpool. I was awfully dis-gusted to hear about it. I have not actually seen any papers about it. I hope it has been exagerated and that Father&nbsp; did not &nbsp;help to quell the mob with his Shelali. I am anxious not having news of you &nbsp;am afraid my letters from Lemnos during the evacuation were held back as other peoples&#39; were. I&#39;m glad I sent the cable on arriving here.
