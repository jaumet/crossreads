there are not too many in England. The band played us out for nearly 3 miles during which time we passed through a succession of Camps, there are thousands of troops round here.
It was a very tiring march into the railway station at Le Havre for we had a fair load up had not been used to carrying our packs for some considerable time, they cut into our shoulders I can tell you. You would laugh if you could only see the class of apple's they are selling round here for that matter England too, they charge 2d each for apples that you would only feel to pigs in Tasmania, scaley, grubby, sour colorless things they are, do you know I have scarce seen a good apple since leaving Australia, with the exception of the imported fruit.
29th. Started our train journey at 4.30 this yesterday afternoon, the country looks splendid right through, we went round by way of Amiens, Arras branched off at Aichet-le-Grand, followed the fighting area right along
