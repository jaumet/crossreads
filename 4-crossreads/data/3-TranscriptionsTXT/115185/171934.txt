8 - say he was carried off the transport semi conscious. His wife died shortly before leaving Sydney - and he told me that he never missed her so much as during the evacuation. It was only two weeks before his death. I think he has a mother and in Sydney. I'd like to tell her about him - but I'm sure Geoffry Street will write to her. He writes good letters too. He was his adjutant. He is at Tel el Kebir - and I sent him & Major Coltman a wire on arriving here - not knowing the latter was dead. Mrs Knox who is living near here & asked me to tea, is the wife of our old friend of Melbourne's Son - Lt Col Knox. I saw him - he has gone to the canal now - one of those fine big boys we saw at their home outside Melbourne - a nice man. His wife is very like our Rosamond. She has left her children in Melbourne and is doing Red X work here. Captain [indecipherable]'s wife & children at Helouan. I saw him too. He's the one in the English Reg. who married his cousin. Capt Edgar  Stephen is here in this hospital
