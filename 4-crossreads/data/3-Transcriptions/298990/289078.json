<p>Front line (Flers) 18/11/16 Snow fell about 3 am in powdery flakes and covered the trenches in a coat of whiteness.  Ferguson moved off about 3.30 for his new position.  At 6.30 a very heavy strafe started on our flanks and enemy pumped much stuff past us &ndash; some rifle fire and machine gun tick-tacking but nothing doing on our immediate front.  White flag has been most extensively used by us to bring in our wounded from No Mans Land &ndash; the aftermath of a recent charge.  The snow remained on the ground nearly all day and looked like coarse frost &ndash; the thaw setting in everything became mushy and sloppy.  The poor devils of men &ndash; their hardships make one's heart bleed. They crouch up together in the trenches huddling under waterproof sheets.  The German trenches opposite us are said to be even worse than our own.  Heavy cannonade in the afternoon and the earth shook with many and repeated concussions of heavy shells.  Low menacing rumble extending to our right.  The surrounding country is a torn and tattered mass of troubled earth in muddy heaps.  The trenches and their parapets are full of Lewis magazines S.A.A. rifles equipment and a thousand and one other things.  Our wires frequently cut but still communication was maintained.  This dugout was built by the Germans and is of standard size, the timbers are all cut to fit and dovetail into each other.  At about 3.30 pm went round our front from flank to flank an experience that was not very enviable.  The Huns were shelling heavily and making the landscape take on the appearance of a ploughed paddock.  The thaw had set in after the snow and the clay sides of trenches and saps were exuding moisture and making everything awfully slippery and unpleasant.  Going left from Battalion HQ to reach the terrace we commenced to see dead men lying on top of the parados.  How shrivelled and "light" a dead soldier looks as he stays sprawled out  ungainly face downwards.</p>
