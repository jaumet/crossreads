  
 June 1915 
 Tuesday 29 
 Arrived in Grafton on Home Leave. 
 Little steam children up at wharf one platform to see last of me. 
 Saw Ed. of examiner with Rita & went home to tea with her. 
 Chat with Major Blumer whose son turned out to be wounded in thumb. 
 Rita played Chopin's [indecipherable] as an only piece & on that account I shall always remember it. 
 Time too short for such a long parting ahead Good bye to Rita for how long?
