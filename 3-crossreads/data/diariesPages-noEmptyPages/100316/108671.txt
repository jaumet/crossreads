20/5/18 Montigny
Another lovely summer day. Bourke the T.O. was wounded last night in a barrage and got a fractured leg. Both he and his orderly were found this morning lying wounded and the horses dead. Busied myself with the question of promotions and will be putting up some N.C.Os. for their commissions. The question of honours and rewards is also a one that requires going into. We had an early dinner and I rode out into Franvillers . Found that not a tremendously satisfactory amount of billeting had been done and had to butt round myself. Saw Colonel Travers (D.S.O. bar) of the 26th at Mess with his officers and yarned with them. Then took a walk around the trenches which are wide and full of quite good bivouacs. Met a little French kiddie whose Mother (a nice woman) I had been fixing up domestic arrangements with as she is the patron. She is going away tomorrow as a refugee owing to the shelling. The little boy is 4. I asked him where his Father is and he said "a la guerre." Ah! la pauve petite, son papa est mort sur le front depuis trois annees. A good air fight took place just about dark, but it was too high up to see the distinctive colourings. The road Amiens ? Albert is now being covered from lateral view by camouflage.
