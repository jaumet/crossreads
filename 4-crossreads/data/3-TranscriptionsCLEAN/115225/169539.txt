Mar. 11th  Beautiful day. Budge came back from Paris leave last night so I spent the morning hearing his experiences - we did'nt go out to-day - I went to Steenwerck in the afternoon & bought writing pad etc.
 
Mar 12th  We did'nt go out again to-day - lovely day - Joe & I walked up to 18th battery in the afternoon & we went to the pictures at the park in the evening - Joe got some tucker from 1st A.C.T.S.C.
 
Mar 13th  We took an engineers party up to Wychatte (on left of Messines) &  waited all day for them, we took a walk all over the joint. looked at the mine craters etc. Fritz came over & left a curious trail of smoke in his wake which  stayed in the sky & did'nt lose its shape for one hour.
 
Mar 14th  We went to Strazeele on "roads" came back & hauled stone from Bailleul railhead to outside points. It rained all last night & this morning but cleared up in the afternoon. heavy bombardments on both sides at intervals
 
Mar 15th  Did'nt go out to-day. We cleaned the lorry in the morning - fine day
