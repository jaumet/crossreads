<p>Towards the end of the day the majority of the Coy were half-drunk so some of us went round &amp; smashed as much grog as we could lay our hands on champagne wine or beer it all went to same way, its a regular danger you know to have such a lot of stuff lying about &amp; you never know the minute you may have to fight for your life, &amp; half witted men are more of a hindrance then anything else, how they swore &amp; cursed when they heard of this but it sobered them up a bit, the day was still frightfully cold &amp; we had our work cut out trying to keep warm, however at 7 oclock we fell in &amp; started off to complete our "outposts", we were going to lengthen &amp; wire them so as to make them stronger</p>
