<p>[On letterhead of John McLaughlin &amp; Son, Solicitors, Union Bank Chambers, Hunter Street, Sydney]<br/>Jn. B.<br/>7 November 1916<br/>My dear Judge:</p>
<p>Herewith letter of the 19th August you asked me for, also a cutting which will be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Geoffrey has, perhaps, fortunately been wounded &ndash; he received a shell splinter in his right leg.  He had just had his first ten days spell, and on return, apparently had forgotten the way to keep out of the road.</p>
<p>You need not trouble about forwarding these, as I will send up for them some time.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br/>J. H. McLaughlin</p>
<p>His Honour Mr. Justice Ferguson<br/>Judges Chambers<br/>Court House<br/>Sydney.</p>
<p>Encl.</p>
