<p>[Monday 11 December 1916]</p>
<p>Rode on Patrol to some old Ruins on Mediteranean, built of White marble big columns that no Camel could carry so evidently brought by boat from Italy by the Romans. The ruins were an old Church with <strike>St John</strike> [ image of cross] Maltese &amp; plenty of bones &amp; skulls.<br/>The Altars were tiled with marble slabs held by Copper which now was only Verdigris- (few Beads)  Further on a deserted Bedouin Fishing Village, boats Nets etc:- &amp; Quail Nets for catching these birds when they flight.  Plenty of old Shark heads <strike>A[indecipherable] Tubs</strike> etc etc:-<br/>We also came across another old Aeroplane of ours which had been shot down near <strike>Al Arish</strike> months ago; now burnt.</p>
