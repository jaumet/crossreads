<p>job I am not doing much riding these times In fact I have only had two rides since I came to this place over 5 weeks now. I am trying to get to Zeitoun for the next course of telephone work. (advanced).</p>
<p>This day last year was the day on which the famous 3rd Brigade made their name at Anzac. I have been thinking of it all day.

A little later on I shall try and give my own feelings and thoughts &amp; experiences when I landed. which was 16 days hence.</p>
