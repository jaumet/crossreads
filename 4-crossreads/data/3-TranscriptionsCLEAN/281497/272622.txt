 Our chaps made another charge today & cleared the Germans from another trench, they still continue to come in, one fellow they questioned reckoned Germany had control of the seas & that England was nearly done, they reckoned that Germany would win in August I saw plenty of their black bread & tasted it, it is sour & heavy to the taste I would not care to eat it at any rate. 
 The dreadful fire slackened down a lot tonight thank God
