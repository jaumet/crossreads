  
 1915 May. 20 Thu. On my own all day & kept pretty busy until 10 p.m. To-morrow (Friday) is the week day on which 12 different Hospital returns have to be made up so that I shall have something to do to-morrow. I find the clerical work very interesting & not at all monotonous as one does not get into a groove. Colonel Sir Frederick Treves (King's Physician) visited Gezira Palace to-day.
