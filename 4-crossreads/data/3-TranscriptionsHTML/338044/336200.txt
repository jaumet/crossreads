<p>wharves, passing hundreds of German prisoners en route, big fellows    &amp; surly looking. We also saw several of these prisoners yesterday morning, some working in the camp &amp; more marching to their camp. Many more prisoners working on the wharf. Hundreds of shells, several big howitzers, &amp; motor transports are unloaded on the wharf &amp; hurried up to the front straight away. We pass some of these 6" Howitzers on the road. "Little Tich, going to see Bill" &amp; similar inscriptions on them   Of course many of our fellows felt like pulling out a bayonet &amp; using it on the some of the surly Germans on the wharf, but it's not the game  Hundreds of German big guns are distributed around the wharves, of all calibres, these having been captured recently during the big push. The usual delay of some hours occurs here again &amp; we have time to get a fair view of the town, but we eventually embark at 8 pm, guards are picked &amp; I am on life-rafts guard &amp; must sleep on deck</p>
