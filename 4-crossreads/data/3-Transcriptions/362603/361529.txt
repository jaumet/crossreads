<p>2.  Soldier's Club for Manly.  Manly will always be up-to-date I think.  I am glad that You met Ewen Gillies.  I am surprised &amp; pleased to hear that Elsie is married.  She is a very nice Girl too, quite one of the best.  Your Birthday Greetings came a month too late.  But what does that matter.  I do not think for one second that You could forget me on that Day.  I have the Wattle &amp; the Rose.  Does the rose have a nice scent?  It has a very heavy pungent smell now.<br/>We were sorry to hear of Dad's accident.  He aught to have been more careful.  I am always ready for a buster whether it is getting off a revolving staircase like we have at Charing Cross Station, or getting off the footpath onto the roadway.  Glad to know that He is getting on alright.  How are His scews, Mum?  Is He still Troubled very<br/>much?  What the devil did You put ascetic acid on Dad's back for, after You had scalded Him?  We only got one parcel so far, Mum.  That was the one I have told You about which contained the Pants &amp; Socks.  Tell Us more about how Dad &amp; George got to work during the Strike.<br/>I noticed where You say that George &amp; Lily walked to Manly to see the Pictures &amp; had to come Home in the Rain.  I have set out in the Rain &amp; walked 3 &frac12; miles just for fun.</p>
