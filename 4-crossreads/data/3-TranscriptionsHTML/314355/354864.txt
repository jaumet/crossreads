<p>June 25, 26<br/>229.<br/>A Dull day of little jobs, and no mail.  Frank up from the Amb. with a proof copy of No. 6 "Ghutz" &ndash; and a good number:  in fact the best of the collection.</p>
<p>June 26<br/>230.<br/>A good day.  Scott in the hut all the day till six, working at his oil-sketch:  I am in an official drawing &ndash; in the R. Corner at the table opposite Mac.  At six away with him (Scott) to La Kreule, to Ambulance Billets, and a happy yarning there with half a dozen - Ellis, Clarrie, Frank D. and others.  Nick and Toby with a Baseball Team.</p>
<p>Mail there, "The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" and the 1st Impression of Alec Waugh's "Resentment" &ndash; in its 3rd edition.</p>
<p>Also T.L.S. of June 13, and the damned educational supplement of June 20, write to them tonight.</p>
<p>Sketched this morning from a Post Card, a back cover design for Ghutz.  So far Basil hasn't sent me up my copy.</p>
<p>Post away tomorrow "William Blake" home.</p>
<p>Called in at Pioneer Transp. and saw Vin Davis awhile.  The same Vin, and the same manner of charm.</p>
<p>June 27<br/>231.<br/>Back, by the pool, after a long walk alone, by Hondeghem, to the M.D.S. and on by S.A. Scottish Camp.</p>
<p>Comes memory tonight and wondering:  lying this afternoon for a while in the sun, a memory came of the men who are dead, and names passed in my mind, and faces of old friends, calling from the old past a hundred happenings.  Jackie and the gold and blue of Bondi, and he the leader of a dozen pagans of life.  At Woollahra P.S., Jackie was in the band, and from Jack Fraser I'd heard of him, and seeing him, I wanted to know him well, that was in 1906 &ndash; or before.  Then I came to know Jackie well, and to envy him his passionate live and easy happening living.</p>
<p>Jackie is dead:  buried by Hill 60.</p>
<p>And Gil Homes follows, Bondi again, and Gil fresh from the showers, standing wet in the sun, a myth-paen of the sun and the surf.</p>
<p>Gil is dead, in Mesopotamia, and Ernie, and Paddy.  Freddy Flowers, and N.H., Norm Reed, and Snowy, Dick Seymour and Mark.</p>
