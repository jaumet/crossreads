<p>Saturday<br/>12/2/16</p>
<p>Rather hot all day &ndash; sea moderately calm, the the old Wandella is rolling badly, I fancy it must be on account of the large amount of water she is carrying, swaying from one side to the other. Have a concert on board every night &ndash; mostly hymns. Have plenty of boxing bouts. AMC boys have quite a rep in the boxing line. On average there is a genuine all out fight once a day, only last night a fellow had to have 6 stiches in his lip.<br/>Pneumonia patient a lot better.<br/>Have arranged for self &amp; 3 orderlys to throw in 2/6 per week each for the Head Steward, as he is looking after us so well. Get anything we want, Fowl, pudding, etc.</p>
<p>What appears tonight in the west as a planet of about the 4th magnitude is really a grand sight although I think it is the garden variety of evening star that shines on New Farm. Most amusing at 3 am &ndash; the engineer must have had too much steam up as they started blowing off &ndash; talk about</p>
