This morning all is well  -  The Destroyers are all out patrolling & AE2 is going to lurk there & see how she gets on  -  She is outside the reef just now  -  We expect the Fleet back today but we don't know definitely  -
The news came thro that De Wet had turned dog on the British in S. Africa  -  This was greatly resented after all the kindness & attention he had from the British  -  I did a 2 hour walk yesterday aftn  -  I saw our well known Silver Eye - Zosterops coerulescens - probably - the same species   -  quite nice to see such a well known chap  -  It reminded me of home  -  I also found the nest of a small bird - probably a fantail  -  The nest had 2 eggs  -  I wouldn't touch it  -  The small red throated but black backed mother was most anxious about it & few around me just like a fantail will  -
