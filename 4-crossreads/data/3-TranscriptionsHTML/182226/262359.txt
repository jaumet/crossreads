<p>Friday 3 December, 1915</p>
<p>Sent to Gozo. Up at 5.15, a breakfast by candlelight &amp; a drive down to the boat in the grey dawn. It felt like being at the fitout again.</p>
<p>Our boat left at 6.30 &amp; arrived at Gozo at about 8.30.</p>
<p>Our quarters are in barracks in an old fort here. I have been put in No 3 Section.</p>
<p>I am with a New Zealander who knows Ernie Kennedy in N.Z.</p>
<p>The name of the fort is Fort Shambray [Chambray].</p>
<p>Did my weeks pay at cards.</p>
