exceedingly commodious and to our surprise was quite a busy shipping centre with something like 2 miles more or less of wharfage.The only defect is with regard to the entrance which is very narrow, & artificially deepened, & protected by a stone breakwater.
We were somewhat chagrined when a yellow flag was hoisted to the mast-top, but our doubts were soon dispelled , for the medical authorities exempted us from quarantine & down came the 'dirty yeller'.We went alongside the wharf & coaling commenced immediately.We were granted leave from 3 to 10.30 P.M. and spent the time till then in watching the blacks on the wharf; they were an endless source of amusement to all the boys.
