27th January 1917. Woke at 8.30 Had breakfast kept ready for going on duty. Duty happened to be up at the first line trenches. Walked up to RL arrived at the trenches at 2 oclock. I felt rather shaky on it. It did not turn out at all what I thought about the trenches. Desolation quietness abounds everywhere at present up there. We reeled out our wire got into communication with RL through them to our Battery. I had my first baptism of fire while at the phone. It was a lively 10 minutes or so I took refuge in a sniper alcove which did not afford much cover. Anyhow I was dead scared while it lasted and am sure a heavy bombardment must be awful. Our Capt arrived at 3.30 it was too late for any "strafe" so we left the works out came away via Japan Rd Willow Walk (a series of trenches which communicate with the first second third lines)! I was very tired hungry when I got back had a good tea. After tea fixed up the stove started our first fire. Thus ended one of the most eventful days of my life.
