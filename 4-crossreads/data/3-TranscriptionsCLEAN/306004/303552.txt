6.10.16(about 14 years old) & some Mounted Military police rode up & ordered us to come out we did so after we had finished our swim. we were lucky in getting down early as later in the morning the Military Police started collecting their clothes when they would not come out; A roll call at 6.30 & 12.30 daily has to be answered to see no one is absent   we received our passes to Alexandria from 2 PM till 11 PM this pass does us all the time we are here. we were given our passes at 1 oclock & did not wait for lunch but made tracks to catch the first tram, about 50 donkeys were waiting for us & Laney, Lindsell, Bains, Todhunter
