 Minia  Camp. 
 Over 100 miles up the Nile from Cairo The old adage "Here today and gone tomorrow" is very true and verily with us lately it has been well proved. 
 We had made a very nice comfortable Camp for ourselves at Beni Salaam and with the exception of the soft sand we were very well off & did not feel inclined to shift in a hurry. But " the best laid plans of mice & men" Etc as Burns says is also true for lo & behold on Sunday morning I was awakened before Reveille and told to put a messenger and one signaller for telephone duty
