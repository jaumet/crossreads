  
 Monday 15 January 1917 [1918] Once again we begin Monday & now Reid (orderly) has gone thank heaven! - rude & no conscience. 1/2 day & went Pyramids, saw Sphinx for 1st time at sunset - there that mystic face is looking out towards the sunrise as it has looked for 6000 B.C. (so guide says).  Palm read & after sitting down all of us in the sand & putting 5 piastres in the line drawn he says, long & happy life - life gets better from now on. A gentleman (2) love you, etc. - marry in about 7 months, go home in six. All the same old take but while he tells it, I adore the sunset sky.
