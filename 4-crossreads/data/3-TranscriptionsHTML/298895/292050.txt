<p>nowhere have I seen the same amount of shrapnel used as here.  Shrapnel cases &amp; pellets absolutely covered the ground &amp; in one place were so numerous that they were used to form<strike>ed</strike> a road.  Many dead germans were still to be seen in the last stages of decomposition &amp; skulls were numerous.  After viewing such a battlefield one is convinced that nothing on earth can withstand our attack providing the artillery is sufficient.  Met a couple of tanks being salvaged one the "Cr&egrave;me de menthe" being rather an historic one.  Brought home some driving bands etc &amp; a German bayonet.  "Thiepval" itself has disappeared but a mound with cellars underneath still remains &amp; is all that is left of what was once the Chateau.<br/>Friday 20th April<br/>Last three days being changeable weather wet cold &amp; fine.  Played the 8th football &amp; won 16 to 6 thus upholding our record &amp; that of the 1st.  Good news of our stunt at Arras &amp; that</p>
