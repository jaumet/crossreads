<p>London. Aug. 28th, 1913.<br/>My dear Alan.</p>
<p>It was a very great pleasure to have your famous long letter of 9th July; I would like to send you a long one "in reply", but you can guess there is not much time to reply to you individually, much as we want to.</p>
<p>We just loved all the items of home news you gave us; especially we loved to hear that Rollo is getting on so well. He will talk quite plainly I expect; I fear he no longer a baby when we see him again. We shall feel awfully eager to hear if you <u>do</u> go to the station in Central Queensland. I wonder what Father &amp; Mother think about you going on the land? Do try &amp; write me another chatty letter with all the news.</p>
<p>I very much hope it may be your lot to take this trip some day. There is so much to learn &amp; enjoy in the old land; &amp; all so wonderfully interesting. Only one always wishes one had been more studious &amp; read more, so as to understand better &amp; enjoy more intelligently. History especially comes in, in England; indeed I may say in Europe, where everything has historical association.</p>
<p>When you are a big rich squatter in the years to come, you may bring the wife &amp; family for a trip to see all these lovely places. (I am quite sure you will "make good" if you set yourself to try). This card gives an imperfect idea of this wonderful gorge between two high mountains, with glacier at top.</p>
<p>Many thanks for birthday wishes &amp; heaps of love from Aunt Edie.</p>
