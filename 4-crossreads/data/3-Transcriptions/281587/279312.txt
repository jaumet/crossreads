<p>say that while travelling in the glorious sunshine here, and sleeping under the stars at night, I have enjoyed a meal of bully and biscuit, with a mug of billy tea, better than any meal I have had anywhere.  Shortly after dinner we began to get into rocky country, and also in an incredibly short time, the sky clouded over, a cold wind rose, and there were ominous signs of approaching rain.</p>
<p>The rapidity with which the weather changes here during the wet season is remarkable.</p>
