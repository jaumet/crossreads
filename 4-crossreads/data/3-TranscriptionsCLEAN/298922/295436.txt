 OUTPOST HAGILI 
 On Outpost all last night again, night & day is so mixed up. I am not sure of the date. Our horses have not been unsaddled since MONDAY & of course none of us have even washed since then.  We have not made a success of our attacks.   I went into a Bedouin Hut. The consequences have been catching FLEAS ever since 1000's of them. They do not bite so much as run about. Very dusty from Divisions moving about.  Joe's  glasses are most useful & save my eyes a lot. This Agricultural Land is much dirtier & cuts up more than the pure Desert Sand.
