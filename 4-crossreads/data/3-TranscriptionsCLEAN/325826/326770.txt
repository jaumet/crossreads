I shall go up to Box Hill (O.V.) for the best part of the time the boat stays there of course.          I am talking quite as if I am coming & I don't know yet for a certainty if I am, but it seems the most natural thing.     If I should be able to get any little mementoes to bring home for various people I haven't the faintest idea what one does about duty, but perhaps if there isn't too much to do in the garden you might be able to meet me- I should like you to wear your usual town hat the one without any ribbon and the dark band that looks something like grease, if you could. But really, perhaps you could advise me in that same letter to  Melbourne  Fremantle what sort of things are dutiable & whether it is wicked to try & hide them or best to put them all together, though the "all" might turn out to be awfully sickly little for they are such robbers here and charge me such ridiculous prices when I try to buy anything & I know it is so because of what other people have said they have paid for things.  As for silks & things like that that I heard were so cheap here, I have priced them & could get just as good and very similar cheaper in Sydney-the mad things.       By the way Father one or two questions that you have asked me before I must answer for very shame's sake & I am sorry I have forgotten each letter.  One was about the French dictionary, but I won't describe it to you because I shall be giving it to Jobber when I bring it home: perhaps I had better though while I am speaking of it in case anything should prevent me coming though I fully intend to give it to Jobber.  It is called English-French Conversational Dictionary & is published or written or something by Richard Jaschke, that is the only name about it.  Mine is the second edition.  I hope An hasn't got one when I get home because this really is a fine little thing & I won't need it any more.
