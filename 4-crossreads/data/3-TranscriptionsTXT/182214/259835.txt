our C Section who came from South Australia & joined us up in Melbourne left us for another part of the canal. & later on left the 8th F. Amb for good & became B Section of the 15th F. Amb. Strange to say the New S. Wales boys were not sorry to lose them as they did not pull well with us, later on they said they would rather have not left the 8th. All this time Darky Hill, Alf Poulton & I were cooking for the officers & Hospital of above 60 patients & we had a good time, I might state we had a fine quiet time here & all the enjoyment we made ourselves, exercising the Indians mules was great fun we got thrown off very often indeed still we enjoyed our little outings in this fashion & we liked our Indians Comrades very much
