  
 Here met by several mine sweepers & Destroyers which the latter led the way & piloted us through the mine field passing 1/2 a mile off several transports ashore at Cape Helles which had been purposely ran ashore when they tried to force the Dardanelles.  The River Clyde & a French large cruiser was there ashore fast & hard & appeared otherwise intact, seval other steamers sunk.  The forts & excavations & dug outs plainly visible.  Seemed to be badly smashed by heavy Naval shells.  Plainly seen were the crosses marking the spot where thousands of troops lost their lives during this sad landing & failure of 1915.  The British are in possession of the forts & hundreds of guns could be seen piled up closely together, the former Turkish Artillery used against us at this particular spot.  Again very heavy guns mounted on wheels are there brought by our men during the recent occupation.  The River Clyde special large openings made in her side could be seen plainly & she appears today as if nothing had happened within a few yards of the shore probably much nearer than she had grounded formally during that sad time of 1915.  We steamed up the Dardanells at 15 knots.  The destroyer 86 leading at 2 p.m. off Chanack.  Forts plainly visable, Best part of the houses blown down, large dents & holes in the hills & soil done by heavy shells.  There again on the opposite side is seen several large transports sunk & beyond refloating.
