I had a note from Neville saying he was coming back to England. So I hope he sees his mother. Please give Edith & her children my love - and Cousin Lily & Percy. Major Lochardt Gibson says he has met them in Brisbane. He is such a courtly old man - and very kind & thoughtful to me. They much love my heavenly mother - I just think of you always with the greatest tenderness and gratitude for all your affection and sweet thought - and writing letters to me. I do value them. Remember me to Mrs Ed & Lizzie & Maggie. Ever your devoted daughter Beth McMillan
