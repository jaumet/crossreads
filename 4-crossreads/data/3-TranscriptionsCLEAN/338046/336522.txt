  
 1917 May was transferred to B Company, and joined a Regimental school for budding NCO's.   We had a fortnight of it and an exam at the end.   All our legs were a bit stiff owing to the extra quick marching that we had been indulging in.  I, with about 39 others, out of 40 passed the exam. One man got a stripe out of it.   The rest of us came a thud. About this time food began to get scarce in England.   In Wilton School of Arts there was a notice:- "Owing to the scarcity of food, will you kindly have only  one Tea  in Wilton today."   So we cut out our usual three feeds and confined ourselves to two.   Over in Broadchalke church one Sunday, I found a soldier playing the pipe organ.   Just as we arrived the old organ blower reniged, so as I had blown a pipe organ before, at Seven Hills church, I  volunteered to take his place, and we had some fine music.   Getting back to the food.
