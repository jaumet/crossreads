Rumour that a big push is to take place tonight orders are that we are not to leave billets on any acc. 
12 midnight. Are standing by ready to go out in motors to trenches. Hope to do my duty as one should. Wounded beginning to come in, We go out in last car arrive Albert at dawn. Ruined town. Taken farther out per motor then walk into battlefield. Such a scene of desolation. Set to work stretcher bearing at once. Heart shaking bombardment, horrible sights. War in all its hideousness. "Casualty" corner. Stack's Poat . Carrying backwards forwards. The horror of those first few hours. such a revelation.
