  
 (or what's left of it) of Villers Bretonneux, & it was a very strange sensation, as we passed the spot where we had such a rough time last May. As I looked on the scene of our trenches there, where shells use to fall thick, & thought of the awful time we had carrying rations through it all, it seemed strange that all could be so quiet now. It shows how far we have pushed the Hun back lately. We set off for Corbie from Villers Bretonneux, Lord, weren't we tired & footsore. We went past familiar spots where we used to put up barbed wire, & dig, tc. & now well clear of Fritz. A lorry took us about a kilo to Corbie, then we walked to La Neuville, & finally hit our destination at 12.30a.m. Think of that, you cold-footed "stay at homes", started walking at 8 p.m., finished at 12.30a.m., & yet we were out to have a rest. Civilians who haven't done these army tramps, lumping rifle, equipment & gear, can have no idea of the utter weariness we felt. We had to get any shelter we could, & 5 of us got under a tarpaulin. We only had waterproof sheets, no greatcoat or blanket, & lay down in our clothes. Golly, it was cold. Wednesday 21 Aug. There wasn't enough breakfast
