Very little transpires just now beyond night and day work at the Galleries completing. The Exhibition is a magnificent display of photographic technique and is well partonised. The color plates are the great attraction - they are superb. The colors are accurate, and project wonderfully brilliantly on the screen. They merit and receive great applause. I am asking that this set of pictures be sent to Australia and retained for the National collection of War Pictures. 
Great speculation and anxiety exists as to whether the Germans will reach Paris. It is the topic of conversation. Things don't appear as bright as they might be.
