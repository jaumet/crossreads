very successful only two of lads killed. They brought back a number of Prisoners, some of whom were only lads of 16 yrs - also got a lot of information - Our point is already too far advanced - so gain nothing taking his trenches yet. Sgt Holt who was killed, was just about to get a Commission & had secretly inherited 12,000. He died in our charge, so we had to t6ake charge till Padre & M.O. took all particulars etc. Had very little sleep.
