Revielle as usual
The 2nd Bde went out on the stunt today, they are making for Bir-el-Abd more to the left again the plane has been reporting men camels there continually for the last few days so the 2nd are going to fix matters.
No mail on the skyline yet, its 8 wks now since one came to light so there ought to be a batch in any day now.
All hands have been going to bed early lately on account of our last stunt we can't seem to get over it catch up with the sleep.
