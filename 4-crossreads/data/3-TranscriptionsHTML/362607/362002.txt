<p>Dear Dad, Mother &amp; George,</p>
<p>Just a P.C. While I am waiting for dinner. I came down here on Duty last night. I am going back in the 2 pm train. I have been all over the place &amp; seen all I could. I will send other  Pictures &amp; write at length when I get back to Bulford. I slept in a lovely bed last night. It is rather unusual too. I generally pitch &amp; toss all night. I sp a few Hours in Exeter on the way down. The Cathedral at that place is grand. I do not think this town possesses one. There is a R.C. Cathedral opposite.  I'll go &amp; have a peep afterwards. Don't think I've turned religious, Cathedrals are often the only place worth seeing in some towns. Must hurry now so will wish You all health &amp; happiness. Love from Harry.</p>
