 almost all night.  Today hot.  Capt. Staley with us again.  The Generals two horses shod today, last shoeing very unsatisfactory, waiting until I come back from dock.  I now hear that I was to have stopped at the D.A.C. for a time to have a spell, but the strings were pulled, and I was taken on the strength of Bty., and the Farrier who take my place supernumery. 
 23-5-1918 Dirty windy day, nothing doing.  Very few enemy planes about last night. 
 24-5-1918 Raining all day.  456 rounds of ammunition to Battery.  Today is as cold as an Australian winter day.  Some heavy Btys in field near our horses lines, likely to draw crabs (enemy fire).  Capt. Staley is showing, had about 18 or 20 men at office this morning, for being absent from early morning parade.  Two of my shoeing smiths amongst them.  He awarded them two horse piquets.  In this Bty. shoeing smiths don't do piquets.
