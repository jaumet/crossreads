<p>[21st  Dec. contd]<br/>&amp; bro Ernie.  Raining all day.</p>
<p>Friday 22nd  Saturday 23rd</p>
<p>Some peculiar sayings drop out sometimes and one today was typical.  Word had come through that the Commander in Chief of 2nd Army Corps would be in District today &amp; the men were told to keep an eye &amp; be careful to salute.  Consequently one of the boys came into the billet at a great pace &amp; announced that the Commander in Chief would be 'prowling' around today.  Prowling has it.<br/>Very clear day &amp; great aerial activity.  Saw some rare fighting in the air.</p>
<p>Sunday 24th  Christmas Eve<br/>Went into Armentieres in the afternoon with Corps Chas Hamblin &amp; Joe Nankevil &amp; had a good look around notwithstanding that aircraft guns were crackling all around us.  After tea we adjourned to YMCA &amp; spent the evening singing Christmas Carols &amp; Hymns &amp; subsequently listened to a natty little sermon by a South Australian.</p>
<p>On return we were surprised to see Col Maguire waiting with a load of 'Comforts' &amp; each of us received a pudding &amp; packet of things from the Comforts Fund (Each packet contained packet cigarettes (Peter Pan) small tin tobacco, Tin boiled lollies, writing pad, playing cards &amp; some nuts).  I also recd letter from bro &amp; parcel from Mrs Hodge of Crookwell.  The Colonel shook our hands all round &amp; wished us merry Xmas.</p>
