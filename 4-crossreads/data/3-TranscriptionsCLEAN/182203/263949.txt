  
 Miss Graham came with us in the afternoon to Coast Hospital. All of us met Matron at 1.30.pm  & took tram for Coast Hospital, had a very enjoyable time. It is a wonderful place on the coast about 9 miles from Sydney  & a most interesting tram ride. We had afternoon tea there & saw all over the different buildings.  Got back to Sydney  about 5.p.m. Went to Grahams, had a cool drink  & then hurried down town  & did a little shopping. Had tea (oysters & coffee) & then walked around the streets looking at the shops. Then we two (Dorothy    &  I) had a nice hot bath at the Grand Central, paid 1/- each. but it was worth it. Went back to Kyarra, & our last trip around Sydney. Slept fairly well that night. Steamed-up at 6.a.m.  & sailed out to Farm Cove at 7.30.a.m.  Had breakfast & then went on deck to watch the other nurses. A small steamer came along side of our boat, with 25 more sisters from New Zealand  &  Sydney. So we are 40 nurses altogether. After the nurses were all on board the boat went back to wharf  & brought over about 500 soldiers  & they all were very happy & lively. It was very exciting, cheering, singing & waving of flags. The Cove was very gay with rowing
