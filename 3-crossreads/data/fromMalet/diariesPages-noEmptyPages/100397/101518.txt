Somewhere In France 5.3.17
Dear Betty. yesterday I received a packet of letters. five of them from you and Mother. I was very glad to know that Mother was out of Hospital again. You must not let her try and do too much. Last night the weather changed and there was a good fall of snow. when we got out this morning, the place was white everywhere. it had to be shoveled up into heaps in the lines, after dinner some of the boys started snowballing but the snow had commenced to thaw, so the battle did not last long. A french woman was carrying a basket of washing up the lines and somebody landed a snowball in the basket then the band played, as you can well Imagine. now there is hardly any snow to be seen once it starts to thaw it does not last long. Soon there will be plenty of slush about but it will soon dissappear, as the ground is very sandy. I was down at the YMCA writing room just before dinner trying to write but my hands were too cold I could hardly hold my pen.
