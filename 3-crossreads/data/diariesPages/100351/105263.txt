Permission granted us to make tea. This was a Godsend. Never did tea taste so good. Water & wood scarce former not too clean, but when hot the drink was Nectar & now I have an new interest in surroundings 50 yds. Over parapet there lies one of our Aeroplanes brought down by Germans. Charlie & I intend sneaking out to-night & looking her over. We did so & collected some souvenirs. Order came at midnight to prepare to move to support of our A & B Coy’s. McMahon buried 11 P.M.
