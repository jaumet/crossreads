<p>(No water and all parched and thirsty) to find water returning 3 am<br/>21st<br/>Stand to 3.30 am and move out to Sqn being met by Sturman.   Return to redoubt and erect doing good work.  Move off and again wind in and out the deep gorges and bridle paths.  Have some stiff climbing to do.  Water scarce.  Raining.  Arrive at end of Judean Hills and look down over the Dead Sea and plains of Jericho.  Wind down on the plain and set out for Jehrico.  Turks shelling the horses from the other side of the Jordan.  Five Taubs appear low down and evidently intend bombing but when scattered as we soon did his mark disappears and they go away &amp; return and we again scatter. Water in a lovely stream of water and have a big drink.  Move on to NZMR and erect for press only.  Turks shelling all day.  Tired out and very sleepy we retire to our bivvies made of any old thing to be found. I make one of two [indecipherable] sheet iron just big enough for one.<br/>22/2/18<br/>Out taking few photos down a creek.  Raining intermittently and windy.  Bread issue so soon.  Beautiful view over plains Jehrico Jordan and Mts of Moab.<br/>23 leave Jehrico 6 PM and return via the Jehrico Jerus road.  A long dreary ride.  Road blown to bits in places.  Ascend steadily</p>
