  
 From Paddington I went by tube to Picadilly & into the Trocadero for lunch, pretty flash you know for this is one of London's leading restaurants & things are done in style there, you go into a lovely big hall & there little page boys meet you dressed in brown suits & bright shiny buttons all over they take your hat & stick & give you a ticket, then there is a manager or something at the entrance & he takes your name if the restaurant is full & when your turn comes calls out your name & a sort of shop walker guides you to your seat, pulls the chair out & when you stand close to the table pushes it under for you & you sit down, then along comes your waiter dressed immaculately in black & white & puts a menu all French on your table takes your order & away he goes.  They wait on you hand & foot here in fact almost feed you, then when you have finished they bring your account along on a silver salver
