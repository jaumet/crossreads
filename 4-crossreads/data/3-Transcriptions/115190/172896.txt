<p>seek the advice of an old campaigner who fixes them (curse him).&nbsp; At sunset we saddle up and are away again.&nbsp; It is nearly as bright as day &amp; would be pleasant but for the dust.&nbsp; Hour after hour passes &amp; my knees are getting sore rubbng against the wallets.&nbsp; I silently curse the man who strapped them on.&nbsp; We turn a corner sharply &amp; I look back along the road we have traversed.&nbsp; One long line of horse-men as far as the eye can see - the regiments are behind us.&nbsp; Now we catch up to a dust cloud in front &amp; discover it is a camel water transport.&nbsp; It takes us two hours to pass that transport, &amp; my knees are getting worse.&nbsp; I am in agony.&nbsp; &quot;Halt&quot;!&nbsp; &quot;Dismount&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;Pass it along&quot;.&nbsp; The welcome order comes along that we halt for 10 minutes &amp; we are to overhaul our leather gear etc.&nbsp; Thank God.&nbsp; I struggle <sub>^</sub><sup>frantically</sup></p>
