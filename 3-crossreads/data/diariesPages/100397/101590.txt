progress, and most of the men have gone down to watch it .. so I am quiet for awhile .. I have not heard of Jack Howell for sometime, now, we have not been near his Div for a good while, I saw Jim Elder when on the March but have not seen him since we settled down here .. I still have the addresses of People that Uncle H. sent me. I fancy there is only one cousin, Rex Rigby  I also have the address of the R.F.C cousin but I dont think that it is very likely that we will meet .. though one never knows. Now I must finish with much Love to all and a Special Share for Yourself from your Loving son Chas.
