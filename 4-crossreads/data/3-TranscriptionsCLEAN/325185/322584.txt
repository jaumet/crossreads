 Dear Father Arrived here yesterday morning.  Had a very fair trip there was a bit of dirty weather on the coast but didn't last very long.  I am storekeeper now also have the smokeroom & bar. Mr White the Chief Steward left on a three months holiday in Dunedin.  Mr Buchanan is chief now & Mr Anderson 2nd. I was given the store & smokeroom.  Will be a  bit better off now than before as it means better wages also will make a bit out of the bar.  The other boys are a bit jealous of me for getting the position.  Not that it is troubling me what they think about it.  There won't be much in it for a while as there are not very many passengers travelling just now. 
 They say things will be better when we get on the Sydney Wellington run.  It was pretty cold in N.Z this time
