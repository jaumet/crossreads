<p>&amp; sent back to Germany daily.  I obtained a huge bell found in the ruins of a Cathedral at Bulgaria which had been blown up by heavy artillery.  The bell has Belgarian characters &amp; weighs 100 lbs. with a crown on the top of it.  The same made of bronze.  I gave it to our Captain &amp; suggested he should pass it on to the Sydney Museum.</p>
<p>27.12.18<br/>8 a.m. off Varna having steamed slow so as to be there at daylight.  Heavy fog prevailed so we had to drop our anchor &amp; await the fog lifting 4 miles off the minefield which is off the Port of Varna.</p>
<p>28.12.18<br/>8 a.m.  Fog still prevailed &amp; we could not see beyond a few hundred yards so it was too much of a risk to run &amp; try &amp; pick up the bouy which the British torpedoe boats had laid to mark the narrow channel of 400 yards wide for a distance of 11 miles.  At 2 p.m. the fog cleared &amp; we sighted two British mine sweepers a distance of 1 mile away, they being on their way to Varna to clear the minefield &amp; like us having anchored until clear weather.  At 2.30 p.m. we hove up &amp; proceeded to Varna picking up the small marks laid down in the shape of bouys, passing within a few hundred yards of the rocks laying near the land.   We proceeded to the harbor &amp; made fast at the wharf at 4.30 p.m.  Hundreds were down of the Civilian &amp; Military population of Varna.  We found out after that we were the first British troopship there since the war began.</p>
