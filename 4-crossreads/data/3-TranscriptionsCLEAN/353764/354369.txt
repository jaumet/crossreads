At the time of its completion there was a drought in the land & one day on going down to put the final polish to its head, they found a hole there, & full of water.  They maintain that this was put there by the Devil to tempt them & are afraid to go near it. I saw the hole (it is about 10ft square by 20 ft deep so you can imagine the size of the Sphinx the body is about 200 ft long & 80 ft high. We next visited the underground Temple which is a marvellous piece of work, it is built of Solid granite piers.  Where they got them goodness only knows. 
 Looking across the Valley of the Nile you can see the old Egyptian Cemetery & on the Hill the hole where the Lions used to come out of & devour the people. Lots of people went in but we did not go as it was a bit too far. We next drove back to the Nile & had a look round there & finally returned to Camp after a very enjoyable time.  I might also mention that we had Camel & donkey rides, & had our photos taken
