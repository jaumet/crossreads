 Wednesday 30 
 Met Fothergill on way to catch train & delighted to find he would be a companion to Brisbane for he goes to enlist. 
 Would give anything to go to Rita again but it cannot be. 
 Rev. Ware up at station & two acquaintances to say farewell. 
 Once again leave Grafton Station but on more serious business than ever before. 
 Rather inclined to be bluish although the stark fact of parting from Rita is deadening as [indecipherable] a numbing of feeling stayed [indecipherable].
