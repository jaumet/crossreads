 Slight shower of rain during the night made everything sloppy & uncomfortable. 
 Had to go off sick today just a touch of dysentery, I hope to be well again tomorrow. 
 They are putting a fourth man in our happy home, it will be a bit crowded. 
 Have been put on a rice diet. Wrote home & to Jessie Chisholm, Tom, Mrs Parsih & Phyliss today. 
 Have been pretty crook & off duty, had a good nights sleep.
