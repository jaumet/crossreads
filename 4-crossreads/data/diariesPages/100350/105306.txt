14th Snipers busy early this morning enfilading our trenches. Turned out another very warm day. Water supply slowly improving. Turks shelled our bivouac for over 2 hours this afternoon killing several and wounding others. More Troops being landed at Suvla Bay the enemy being pressed back in some places. A great many of our lads being struck down with sickness are being taken to "Anzac". After dark I crept out over the parapet and recovered 2 Paybooks and other belongings from two of our dead comrades who fell in the advance. Snipers "possies" pretty close to our firing line, got to be very cautious.
15th Warships continue to shell 971, and Turkish Field batteries at "Anafarta". Several of our lads wounded earlier in the campaign returned to Battln to day. Sick list growing daily. Troops preparing for another dash at 971. Heard this morning that our 1st Division made an attack on "Lone Pine" to the right of "Anzac" and were successful, but lost very heavily. Capt A. Snow a splendid officer of the 1st Battln who had previously won the Military Cross was recommended for the CV.C. He died from wounds. Several of us run a risk this afternoon and went for a dip to get some of the dirt off, Turks got a Machine Gun on to us and we were off in a twinkling all escaped unhurt. Went into trenches at 7.P.M relieving D. Coy.
