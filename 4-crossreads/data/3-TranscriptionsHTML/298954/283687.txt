<p>Arrived back for dinner at 6.30 p (Dear old Burgess had dug up some spuds &amp; baked 'em with bully beef,) and then I had to rush away to my histrionic labours at the "Hip".</p>
<p>Fri. 8th Nov.<br/>Events are moving rapidly.   The Emperor Karl has abdicated &amp; an armistice has been granted Austria.

Whittaker, Smith.<br/>go to Schweidnitz.<br/>Ted and old Freestone (of Fryatt's ship, the "Brussels") go to Wanbeck, another party &amp; myself (as R.S.T.) goes to Clausthal in the Hartz Mountains. (where Captn's Saunders &amp; Donaldson are.)</p>
