<p>Stables as per usual<br/>The back mail I spoke of yesterday came to hand &amp; included 20 letters for me 6 from Nell 8 from home &amp; the rest from friends including Mac &amp; F Coles.  The sale went off OK considering the times in the [indecipherable] 16 men Sgt Masters and myself went for a 10 mile ride on Harold's horse. When I came back Bert [indecipherable] brother was back from Ch mas &amp;stayed to tea.  After tea I filled in my time writing letters to home &amp; Nell.  I did well for Xmas cards &amp; got 6.  Mitch 7 Larkin went over to [indecipherable] and after being robbed by several guides &amp; niggers saw the interior of the Great Pyramid.  Frank climbed the Pyr and after Bert had taken a few photos.  The [indecipherable] are not proving too good.  At the A tent this a//noon was a Christening of 2 ships.  Bed 9.30</p>

<p>Stables as usual<br/>My turn to sleep in then return to my squad they are getting on finely but one man Cunningham is down with measles &amp; now am one man short but expect to replace him within a day or two as it is I have two new men who are even now showing promise, maps are claiming all my attention at present both making and reading my private one is nearly complete.  In the afternoon carry the squad on a step further after tea the fellows were put on lamp work but the work is shockingly done and tomorrow night they go back to group reading after work play cards with the Regt N.C.Os and one is very funny with his opponent he continually hands over his cards consequently he euchred him 6 times.
