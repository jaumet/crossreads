 10/9/17. The order to proceed to the forward area was cancelled. Spent another week in training. Lieut Smith was killed by a bomb from an aeroplane guess my promotion will hang fire again. Went over to La Motte. Reconnoitered the Chateau La Motte where General Birdwood is. Saw some peaches growing on a wall; swam the canal that separated me from them, and sampled them, for they are a novelty. They were good. 13/9/17. The Battalion moved today. Went up to the Dominion Lines and camped in Huts. This is familiar ground we were here last year. 16/9/17. We are in reserve to the 2nd &amp; 3rd Brigades. Have position in deep dugouts in what was once the old Hun line.
