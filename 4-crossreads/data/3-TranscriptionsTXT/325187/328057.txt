[Friday 10 November 1916]]Anchored alongside wharf at Gibraltar to repair damage done by Storm, am not posting any notes coz I doubt if mail will go quicker than we will-.  Inoculated once again for cholera we go from here to Malta & then a week to Alexandria.Hope to go ashore this afternoon "Gib" is honeycombed with galleries & big guns & a good deal of shipping is in the bay- all Nationalities  We owe a debt of thanks to our Skipper for pulling us through the storm-New life boats are to be provided here.Went ashore & bought papers etc-  At night Gib is very pretty with powerful search lights looking across the bay - we have coaled & taken in fresh water
