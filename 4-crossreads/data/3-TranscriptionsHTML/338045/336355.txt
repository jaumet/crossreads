<p>7 am. Find out now that not feeling too well. Very little to knock me up. Quiet morning &amp; Lily Schwerer arrives at hospital at 3 pm. After looking around the wards &amp; theatre, have tea &amp; take a walk, still drizzling rain (miserable day &amp; night) pulling up a Churchyard. Rather romantic, love on a tombstone. Anyway does me &amp; a good time, after which set forth home. Having schemed to get out (No Pass) have trouble getting in. climb the fence about a mile up the road &amp; after many falls in mud, over prickly bushes etc, eventually roam in, wet &amp; muddy &amp; get to bed.</p>
