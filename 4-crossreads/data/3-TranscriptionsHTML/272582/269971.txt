<p><u>Boots, ankle.</u>  <br/>226 pairs have been drawn from A.O.D., 132 pairs have been returned unserviceable. There are at present 20 pairs in the Q.M. Stores (serviceable and unserviceable). Under Routine order by Inspector General of Communications, No 177 d/d 1/10/16, and Base Routine Order No. 3097 d/d 4/12/17, a second pair is authorised for L of C Troops. Therefore it will be seen that the number drawn is more than accounted for by the second issue and those remaining in stock, but this fact is accounted for by some men being in possession of a pair of lighter boots, not obtained through military sources, and thereby not drawing the issues entitled.<br/> <u>Jackets. S.D.</u>  <br/>108 have been drawn from A.O.D. 11 are in Q.M Store, the balance have been issued to replace those rendered</p>
