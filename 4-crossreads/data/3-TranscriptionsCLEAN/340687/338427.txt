May, 1917. Thursday 3Fine day but unpleasant dry wind. Up at 8 and cooked breakfast and cleaned up and ran engine in morning. Slightly better & pumped tank about 1 ft from top. Officer round yesterday & intends to close this point. Pumped again in afternoon and only would go for about 1/2 an hour & also cleaned carburettor. Went to pictures. Change of programme in evening - Very good. Read some surveying before bed.
