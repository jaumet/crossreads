A site for a million ration bakery is being sought for in or around Rouen. Major Prior O.C. 1st Fld Bakery has been over a good many proposed sights. Today I went on the route to Pavilly and selected one place. The water Supply could be met here, but this site may present difficulties in haulage. It was as previously mentioned intended to build this bakery at Calais. Machinery and ovens have been on order for some time, and are now complete.
