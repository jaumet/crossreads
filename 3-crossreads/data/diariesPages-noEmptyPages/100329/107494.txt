for Gallipoli at 7 p.m. 20th Bn left behind on "Saturnia".

Saturday 21st Aug. 1915

General clean up – ship now in a far cleaner condition than when we boarded her. The latrines are now fit for use & the ship is habitable.

This morning I have counted over 100 ships at anchor in the Bay – Mudros Bay as it is called. It is a circular bay of good proportions. The shore line is mostly tenanted by the military & seems as far as I can see from the ship to be under cultivation – fodder etc. About ½ mile (?) inwards the land rises by a series of gradual declivities & so the whole has the appearance of a huge basin. The mouth of the bay is narrow & is protected by booms & nets. The channel for entrance is narrow. Hostile ships, underwater craft etc are absolutely debarred from entering. The bay forms an excellent base.

Left Mudros Bay 5 pm for Gallipoli on S/S "Osmanieh". Great send off through lines of British, French & Russian battleships & cruisers. Noticed H.M.S. "Agamemnon".

Visibly impressed by speed of "Osmanieh" – travelling 18 knots easily. Did 26½ knots on trial speed. Belonged to Khedivial Mail Co., passenger route Alexandria to Constantinople. All lifeboats slung out & life belts ready. Boys in good heart, singing & laughing in chorus. The beginning of what we have longed for during months past is now at hand. What will the end be. Victory! Yes. Victory or nothing.

Arrived at Gaba Tepe Anzac (Gaba Tepe a few miles further south) at about 12 pm
