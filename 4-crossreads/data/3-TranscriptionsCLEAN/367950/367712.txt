  
 Have just given the horses their 7.30 feed and now for bed.  Wilsons mare  Wilsons mare Lady Barratt by name got loose the other night and caused hell's delight by galloping all around the camp over everything and everyone all the picquets attempt to catch her failed. She is the worst horse in the whole regiment when she does get loose.  Last night again she slipped her head collar and went careering around through the camp the unfortunate Sentry on our lines going frantic we told him it was simply impossible to catch "Lady Barratt" but the poor fellow had to make some sort of attempt as part of his duty. She kept each sentry busy as they came on duty. But the amusing part of it was She would persist in galloping at racing speed (and she  can  travel too) right through the officers bivouacs upsetting buckets etc in her mad gallops. The bivouacs by the way were just palms sticks stuck in the ground with a few bushes around and on top to keep the dew off and the officers were afraid to go to bed for a long time thinking she would collide with their frail shelters Some one  said   yelled "who owns that horse"?
