  
 [Sunday 14 May 1916] 
 1st L.H. Arrive 10 AM Busy fixing up Camp once more 120 in SHADE inside a Tent last week- but better than the cold. We can carry very little kit & it pays to have a few articles of the  very best  quality only- the good PANTS.  [Following paragraph is crossed out] My only regret is that I did not punch the Yeomanry Officers head.  They are mostly blue blooded Lords. No mails are to go to England or Australia for a fortnight Saw young Allanson today- & many men that I have not seen for a long time. Captain of the day today.
