 August, 1915 Friday 13 My wound is a little more serious than I thought.  101 Temp today &ndash; Xrayed &amp; a bit of bone out latest instructions to irrigated &amp; dressed 3 times a day [indecipherable] back for a week but I have [indecipherable] not writing too thankful to be here &ndash; Just heard that Col Stodard of 2 reg &ndash; L.H. was killed Col Rowall 3rd L.H. died in boat. Our Brigade is "Mafish" X but we all feel now that we did our bit.
