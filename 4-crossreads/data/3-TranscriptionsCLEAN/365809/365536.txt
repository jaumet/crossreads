  
 (2) I am getting rid of all superfluous kit, anyway and intend travelling very light from now on. Just at present I am the most unpopular officer I should say in the squadron. I have been inoculating for typhoid and, like the cook when the ration and issue is bad, get black looks from all and sundry - more marked because my own dose  (a bono fide one too) did not affect me except to a slight extent locally. A good many of the men have had a bad trip with it - probably because they' re a little run down after their recent turn on the line whence we have just come for a spell. 
 I am afraid there is a big chance of our having some malaria trouble - the mosquito is here though in small numbers at present and the Salonica troops have the parasite. Prophylactic measures - directed towards the prevention of mosquito breeding have been adopted for some time with excellent results but unfortunately you cant get them all - the country farther N where we hope to go has always been malariel.  I don't fancy it - will ever be very bad though - like it was in Salonica. 
 With kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson and yourself Yours very sincerely Ronald J. Hunter
