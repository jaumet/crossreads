<p>Sidman  for King and Strain and going down to Horse lines to-night for trial to-morrow.  Welcome change.  Fritz's artillery very active to-day.  Fine warm day.  Set out after tea at 6.15 and walked down to Brasseye camp taking several short cuts.  From there on to Pioneer Farm and drivers arriving about 8 soon after dark.  Saw Brenner and got a space with Sidman and King on floor with drivers.  Bed about 10 but couldn't get to sleep till about 2 in morning.  Heavy bombardment on our front of gas shells all along by our tunnels and our guns replied.  Two heavy guns also firing.</p>
<p>18.3.18<br/>Got up in good time and rolled blankets and went out at 9 with Thomas &amp; Jensen and the others.  Went through La Clytte to a camp a little further on to left.  Not very many for trial and two were well guarded and handcuffed together and we were first on list.  Very short trial as each pleaded guilty and we left shortly afterwards and arrived back after 20 min. walk at 11.30.  Had dinner at 12 and in afternoon after a spell on grass in sunshine went up Mount Kemmel.  Excellent view to Merrin, Roulers, Ypres and Warneton but rather a bad mist.  The H.V. gun opened on us and one shell fell just behind observatory.  Kemmel</p>
