Tues. 16. Wrote M.S. Letter No 4.
Fell in at 9 & after standing around for about an hour in the snow, were dismissed. This is an old Flour Mill where we are billeted. There is a waterwheel near by & the noise of the water rushing over the wheel sounded just like the surf at Manly. After Tea we went to a Show organised by the Aust. Comforts Fund. They had a fine big hall & the 13th Band to play at intervals; but their show was absolutely rotten. Colley, Priest, Mac, & Stan Wright also went & they also had the same idea as myself that the "Night birds" was far better in every way.

Wed. 17. Glory: reveille at 6. A foot of snow on the Ground & more coming down. It was mighty cold turning out, but it had to be done. We fell in at 9 & marched away at 9.30 The country looked very pretty, but it was sloppy under foot & made the walking most unpleasant. 
Franceâ€™s Birthday
We arrived at Becordel about 12.30 & B sec are camped in the same tent that we were in last time. Our blankets were carried on the waggons, which made our loads much lighter to carry. The 16th are still in charge of the Rest Camp & the 5th are still across the road. We got some hot Tea & had Dinner with the Rations we had carried. The Guns are banging away merrily & we are going a bit closer to them tomorrow. Got long Letter from Ruth B
Murphy, Townshend, Lancaster, Sgt. Roberts & [Prisst?] went away on leave to Blighty. Lucky Beggars. We went to Bed early as there was nothing doing.

Thur. 18. Fritz put a few shells over near us last night just in a friendly sort of way. It was very cold in the Tent & very few of us got any sleep. Reveille blew at 6 & we had Break at 7. Left Becordel at 9.46 & marched through a foot of snow to the A.D.S. at Bernafay Wood.
