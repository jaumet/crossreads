October 1st 1916.Sanitary job still going strong. Met an old pal of mine today. Joe Punch (once a member of the Cammeray Cricket Club)   He left Sydney 8 years ago & enlisted in Queensland. Received the sad news today of the death o Eric Conolly   I can hardly realise it.
Sunday 8th October. 12 months today since we left Sydney for Melbourne.
Thursday 12th October.Shifting again on Saturday 14th. have no idea where our destination well be. It may probably be to our winter quarters. For the last week Fritz has been very quiet I believe our guns found his battery, & blew it to pieces. A bright prospect in front of us (I don't think). When we leave on Saturday we will carry as well as our packs, two gas helmets, one steel helmet & a blanket.,  some weight. One cannot realise how heavy these articles are unless they have been through the ordeal.
