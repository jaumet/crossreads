<p>Sunday 19 September, 1915</p>
<p>Very tired only had about 3 hours sleep. It was a lovely moonlight night, one bullet hit right in the opening of our pit &amp; a piece of barbed cut the boot of a man I was talking to in the trench.</p>
<p>Received a letter from Mrs Parish with some little trinkets from Australia Day which I was glad to receive.</p>
<p>Had to go &amp; get the mail with the O.C. It was a long climb &amp; I had quite a lot to lug about.</p>
<p>Had to move to another shed but we have fenced off and have&nbsp;little home which has the same name as before.</p>
<p>Cigarettes issued today. A&nbsp;mate of Bernie Norteses came into our new house, his name is George Ball.</p>
