about 2 miles away across the sand, here we found 5 poor devils suffering from Sunstroke & effects of the heat, they were all unconscious - We done what we could to give them relief & brought them in two sand carts - We were just about done up ourselves - a fellow must do a job like this across the sand to really understand what a hard lot a stretcher bearers lot is. About 6.30 pm I took sick & had an awful night - had got a touch of the sun - I nearly went mad, was vomiting blood.
18/5/16  Thursday
A lot cooler - I felt very weak - Drilling till 9 am - Then went for a swim - The Tent next to us are always arguing with each other - they got into holts to day & one fellow had two stiches put in his eye & another was out for a long time, having been hit with a tent mallet - Charley Chaplin knock out was not in it.
