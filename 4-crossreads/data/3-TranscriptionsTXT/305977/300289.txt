 Monday 6th Decr to Sunday 12th The weather during the week has been quite warm.  Things have been fairly quiet except for a few bombardments &amp; artillery "hates".  On Tuesday we got some mail, both English &amp; Australian.  I received a parcel from a cousin Miss Sutherland &amp; also  letters from Doug &amp; Uncle JD.  Also wrote letters to mother, Doles Blair &amp; Miss Sutherland.  A lot of troops have been withdrawn during the week.  On Thursday several warships bombarded some new Turkish gun emplacements &amp; it proved the biggest bombardment I have yet seen here.  Our squadron were out at Wilson's Lookout on Monday Thursday &amp; Sunday.  Jean McCarthy of
