Had a fairly liberal issue of rations this morning we want them badly too we also had 14 pair of clean socks per platoon not enough but better than none at all I suppose This morning Len I received a fair batch of letters they cheer one up considerably when things are miserable. Aunt Carrie especially is a very cheerful writer I must say all Aunties have acted tip top to Len I for they all write regularly send lots of parcel's, while I am afraid they do not hear too often from us, of course we have not the inclination nor time for letter writing I'm sure they understand that part of the business.
This book is nearly in pieces for it has had a very rough time has been knocked about all over the place but so long as it hangs together till it gets home that's all I care for it can be recopied again.
