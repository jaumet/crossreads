 The house &amp; outhouses take up 3 wings &amp; the stables the other, being built in two story's.  Scotty &amp; I have a large comfortable room.  Dick Hooper &amp; Toby Williams another, Wilson a small one, Kay &amp; Fisher another.  Starnes, Seddon, Chaildecott &amp; Lieutenant Crawley-Boevey &amp; old Wilson have small ones to themselves.  The officers occupy the top floor &amp; the Sgts the lower rooms. 
 We have got a large mess room also the Sgts.  I was elected Mess President today &amp; am arranging with a cook who swears he once cooked for the Shah.  Got the old devil new clothes &amp; cooking utensils.  Scotty has built a fairly decent cookhouse &amp; is now arranging to build another to bake bread, as one of the Sgts. thinks he can make bread from sour dough in lieu of yeast.
