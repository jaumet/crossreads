My dearest Father & Mother,I have to thank you all very much for your loving birthday wishes to hand yesterday & also for the parcel containing sweater, shirt & envelopes which arrived by to-night's mail.  It was very good of you & I appreciate your kindness.  The sweater will be very useful as we had our first frost (a black one) last Monday.  The shirt, Mother dear, is a nice strong one, & will come in very handy.  Please tell Walter and Anna that I will write to them separately on Sunday as I am kept busy now.There has have been some articles in the paper ("Telegraph") about the drought having broken etc, simply because of a bit of rain on the coast & one or two places inland.  Here we   are worse off than ever we were.  We have three four dams on the place & three out of these are dry & the other only has about a fortnights supply in it.  When this gives out we will have to go about 2 1/2 miles to water the horses & stock.  We are feeding every thing now, including the sheep, on hay & straw mixed.  The sheep have knocked off dying like they were, & the stock Inspector who was out here last week said that inflammation of the tummy was the cause of the deaths, due of course to the dry feed.  The green shoot on the grass soon died off as we got no rain to keep it going.I got rather an unexpected birthday present yesterday
