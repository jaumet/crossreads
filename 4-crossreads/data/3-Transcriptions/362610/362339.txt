<p>Wednesday 3 May 1916<br/>A fine day. Dressed &amp; stayed in the tent, in the afternoon going across the railway line to watch a football match, Officers &amp; NCOs V Men; the latter won by 9 to 6. It was a good game, the C.O. &amp; Adjutant (Lt. Chaffey) of the 2nd Division coming down to watch it. Just as it got dark Prescott &amp; Moy were called away by 2 sergts. who had noticed peculiar flashing of a light on the other side of the embankment about 20 yds. from Headquarters. It proceeded from a small hut facing the decollate sand dunes &frac34; mile away, so the party rushed the place. The operator of the light at once took to his heels, but after a chase over the football ground &amp; ploughed potato field was run to earth &amp; brought back to H.Q. a prisoner. Of course nothing further was heard of him but it is almost certain that he would be dealt with as a German spy. This is the tale as told by Prescott &amp; generally believed until the truth leaked out that the "signal" light came from the cottage. They made up the yarn to compensate for their disappointment.</p>
