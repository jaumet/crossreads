 This afternoon I took a train ride from Pont des Briques to Hardelot on the sea, south of Boulogne. It is a fine watering place with a nice beach, tiled promenade, tennis courts etc. The houses are modern billetsvillas and look very nice.
 The wood, planted in the dunes is fine mostly of pine trees. On the route is an old castle where Henry VIII lived while the Field of the Cloth of Gold was on. A fine old house in Pont des Briques is where Napoleon 1st planned his Austerlitz Campaign 1805-6.
 In fact the whole place abounds in historical interest. At Ardres (Sept 16.) the Camp of the Field of the Cloth of Gold
