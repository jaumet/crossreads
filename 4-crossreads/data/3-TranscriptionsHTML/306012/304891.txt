<p>Wed. 8th May<br/>Weather good, plenty of work, plenty of artillery activity but no big "hop over" from fritz.  The <strike>latter</strike> last mentioned is expected at any time.<br/>The "tommy" in a Labour Company of the B.E.F. gets a rough spin.  Every man to qualify for this Corps must have some disability, flat feet, defective vision, hernia, bad teeth, etc.  The result is that they are always ailing and large daily sick parades result.  He is a despised man, rarely receives decent medical attention &amp; is usually a down-at-heel looking individual as no-one worries about keeping up his equipment.  We feel sorry for these poor beggars straggling along the roads in bunches of 30 to 60 with pick or shovel on shoulder.  And yet they do good work.  Some-one must make &amp; repair roads &amp; bridges, and dig trenches</p>
