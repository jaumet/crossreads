  
 we have "orders" to remain in our dugouts as much as possible for the rest of the day, so that accounts for me writing at such length. I have nothing to do & I can't sleep so I might as well put the time in writing. Last night 2 German runners lost themselves & walked into B. Coys trench  they had been sent round it appears to find out how many men had been recommended for the Iron Cross in their regiment & got lost on their way  a very easy thing to do, both these runners wore the Iron Cross." There is a most tremendous amount of Tasmanian jam being used in France now, where ever you go you will see it & it is of a very fine quality too. Have almost recovered my voice I haven't been able to speak above a whisper
