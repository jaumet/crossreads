 it was worth it. 
 Saturday 3rd Feb. &amp; Sunday 4th Nothing of note to recount. Usual cold prevails with no sign of a thaw. Duties same as days preceding. Guns still very active some specially large ones making themselves felt. 
 Monday 5th Feb. Nothing of importance doing. Great rumours about concerning American attitude over Germanys U-Boat manifesto. I annoy quite a number by refusing to believe that America has already declared war &amp; that Austria has asked for a separate peace etc. Personally I save myself a great deal of worry by refusing to believe or even think about anything until it is official &amp; don't they flare up when I start putting such questions as Who told you? Did you see it yourself etc. Tis taken as a personal slight.
