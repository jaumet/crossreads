<p>And I know just how 'twill be,<br/>When the evening shadows, deepening<br/>Shall bring in eternity</p>
<p>3<br/>Though the Sun go down for ever<br/>I have his unfailing Grace<br/>And the Shadows darkly creeping<br/>Cannot hide His blessed Face<br/>For "they shall not walk in darkness"<br/>"Who follow me, said He, <br/>And Glory of His Presence<br/>Shall go down the Vale with me.<br/>When the Shadows, darkly creeping<br/>Shall bring in Eternity</p>

<p>"The Past"<br/>"It is a well known fact that many men who had been in Holy Orders previous to the War, and enlisted, have thrown away altogether all profession of faith  Some it is known, have been through Hospital even as Padres for venereal disease</p>
<p>The Past<br/>They march before me in solemn array<br/>These ghosts of my buried years<br/>Ghosts of the days when I served the King<br/>And knelt at His throne with tears<br/>At the foot of His Throne with tears</p>
<p>2<br/>Knelt at His Throne with tears for those<br/>Who were as I am to day.<br/>Wandering, wandering, out in the Gloom<br/>Afar from the narrow way.<br/>The straight and narrow way.</p>
<p>3<br/>The Ghosts of a thousand Sermons pass<br/>And gibe at me as they go,<br/>And whisper, and whisper, stealing past<br/>Of bottomless pits of woe<br/>Of death, and pain, and woe<br/>4</p>
