 OCTOBER &nbsp; TUESDAY 31 &nbsp; 1916 
 Fairly fine. Got up to Edinburgh about 9 AM &amp; had a bath &amp; breakfast at the Caledonian Hotel &amp; got a room there. Went out &amp; saw mother afterwards &amp; gave her a great surprise. We went round town afterwards &amp; got some Xmas presents. Went out to Tarnhouse in the afternoon &amp; saw Alan. I came in with him in the sidecar &amp; we got a box &amp; all went to see the &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; in the evening. It was good. Went out to Redford Barracks &amp; saw&nbsp; Alan &nbsp;Keith Moses &amp; Bill Tucker. Keith came to the theatre with us.
