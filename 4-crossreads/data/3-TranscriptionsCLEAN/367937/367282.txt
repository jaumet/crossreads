  
 I was supprised that you had not got any letters from me by 17th July. I posted them about 1st June so hope you got them soon afterwards. Your letter is No. 8 17th July 1916 The papers I received were two Guardians and 2. S S. Journals the others were Australations from Alan. Your letters are all rather funny now as you all seem to think we are in England instead of the desert but it is not really as bad as when Colin wrote to Miss Smith because now there are no sand flies or mosquitoes and Abdul has come and gone Finish I hope Father's cold is alright again though I suppose it is long ago! I was glad to get a letter from Aunt Katie from home saying you looked very well; you see I can believe her whereas I could not be quite certain if only you had said it. There is a rumour on that after to day no letter is to go for three weeks - don't know whether it is true but the section is making hay while the sun shines and are all writing hard; we are an awfully happy family and have been telling each other what to say & all signing the letters & all sorts of tommy rot. They have church parade every Sunday here now - I was not able to go last Sunday as I was on guard but the Sunday before I was able to go and stayed for Communion as well - Yes I read my Bible pretty often Mother dear! I cant do it every day but I read it as often as I can. Stella Writes saying she has sent me a parcel; so we are all eagerly expecting it - It is funny when West & I are out with the troop we get talking sheep and almost forget where we are - it feels like riding out mustering again at home instead of plodding through the desert - Things must be looking up some at home I guess with "Arawata" and the car! Eh what! Love to father and yourself Mother I am Your loving son Robert C. Wilson
