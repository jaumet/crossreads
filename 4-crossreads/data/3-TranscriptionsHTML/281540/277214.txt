<p>10-10-15<br/>Swim at beach off a water barge,  All stores wet and tangled up with gale and piers damaged.  Barges in many case thrown broadside on up the beach and waterlogged a terrible mess and a blow to their neatness.  Constructing a new terrace about 30' up cliff and stacking some stuff there.  SAA Carts and other vehicles (hundred) in line along the beach nearly all awash to axles</p>
<p>Gaba Tepe looking its best by growing dawn ---- viewed from sap opposite Indian Camp.   Hospital ships changing places<br/>Quiet morning here in trenches and continued all day until about 1645 when our Islamic friend started to get closer inch by inch in his underground digging until we were much afraid we would have to blow him up  Orders flying round and kept at work here until knowing what to get on to next.</p>
<p>At 1900 their tunnel seemed to take a turn away from us judging by sound but on the morrow it is hoped to break right up inside, push a force up and take the C &ndash; with cold steel, under cover of the night and then command place.  Quite a far amount of rifle and machine gun fire tonight and the dead eerie sound of bursting bombs everywhere around us  Bed Aired at 2142</p>
<p>11/10/15<br/>Rain and cold for the hour's "stand to" but grapped a towel at "carry on" woke Doctor and got a glow up walking briskly through saps down to the beach.  Had a good brisk swim but appeared to be shortwinded.  The tug up the hill on the return journey is a killer but whole operation from leaving here to getting back is 1 hour. Clean</p>
