<p>1.8.18<br/>Burkitt woke us at 7 for graves and told us we were moving in aftn.  Breakfast at 9 and had to get up and prepare for moving although very tired.  Dinner at 11.30 and moved down to Horse line at 1.30 relieved by 29th Division.  Marched down and very hot and camped in open air.  Kit inspection at 6 and I have very heavy pack with blanket.  No news except move about 1 in morning to La Kreule for motor lorries to <strike>Hazebrouck</strike> near Saint Omer.  Rumours of spell but mostly to go down for stunt on Somme with other divisions.  Tried to sleep but couldn't get any sleep at all.  Bombs were dropped fairly close and fairly cold.</p>
<p>2.8.18<br/>Called at 1 and started at 1.30 and marched to Hazebrouck, Godewaersvelde Road by railway and caught lorries.  Fairly comfortable and no time to wait.  Good journey but very roundabout and arrived at Henringhem [possibly Hondeghem] at 5.50 &amp; got some cocoa &amp; biscuits at Comforts Fund.  Marched to about 4 kilos from village &amp; some trouble with No. 3 about billets.  Spent all day cleaning up etc. &amp; had to move again to new billets, not very good and very crowded.  Got 2 hours sleep in <strike>evening</strike> aftn. and then went down to Wardeckes [possibly Wardrecques] on bike for ride.  Home at 9 and to bed very tired.  Slept well and had to get up twice.  Some rain till 3 o'clock.</p>
<p>3.8.18<br/>Fine but cloudy.  Up at 6.30 and prepared for drill order at 9.30.  Did an hour's rifle drill &amp; dismissed.  Read in morning &amp; going to St. Omer in aftn.  Caught lorry in and had to change a few times.  Not much doing and walked about all time.  Home by 8.30 and to bed about 10.</p>
<p>4.8.18<br/>Up at 7.30 for breakfast and</p>
