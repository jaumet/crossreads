<p>support lines, we must have gone 8 miles, are now within 500 yards of Fritz. All the Ambulance bearers are working together &ndash; 8th do 8 hours &ndash; the 14th do 8 hours &amp; the 15th do 8 hours, as we have to carry patients back some 5 miles we work relay posts of 8 or 12 at posts &ndash; it is very heavy work bearing here &ndash; it is impossible to get along at all in the trenches &ndash; so we carry on top 4 or 6 men to a stretcher &ndash; you slip this way &ndash; then that &amp; by trying to dodge one shell hole you fall into another. &ndash; It is quite true to say over nearly every yard of ground there is a shell hole, some of which you could bury a horse &amp; cart. It is enough to turn one up the nights &ndash; the unburied germans the partly buried ones &ndash; which are easy enough to see by some portion sticking out &ndash; the stench also is cruel, on this account we very seldom used a Fritz dug out as some of them are full of dead &amp; the entrance thrown down. The Germans were in this spot exactly three weeks ago &ndash; Any amount of Souvenirs to be had, but unless small &amp; light the weight kills a man on the forced marches we had had lately &amp; we have no chance of getting them away. About &frac12; mile away is a wrecked tank &amp; coming</p>
