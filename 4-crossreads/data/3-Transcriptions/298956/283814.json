<p>also killed and ate it.  My word weren't we hungry.  I was a bit luckier than the others.  An old woman was good to me.  She used to give me a plate of Buttermilk soup.  Now and again also a few potatoes.</p>
<p>On the 4th May I received my first packet of bread from Denmark.  It was mouldy green but I kept it.  On the 6th May, a Sunday, Bill Brookes an American, and myself bought a piece of soap from one of the Englishmen with us.  He charged us 5/- for it (the price the Germans would have paid for it) and got away from our barrack without being seen and went to a house we know to change soap for bread.  The woman offered us a small piece of bread for it, which we refused and told her it wasn't enough.  She had beat us before on the same thing and we wanted revenge, so when she went inside to get more bread, we stole a pot of jam each.  When she came back she looked at the jam shelf and we were getting ready to run if she said anything, but she didn't notice it, but she gave us a jar with a half loaf of black bread.  We went away and made for some woods, and there sat down and finished out pot of jam and about half the bread.  We then made for home and made a bread pudding with the mouldy bread and the jam and water.  We intended it for my birthday, 7th May, the next day, but when it was cooked we couldn't see it stand, so we ate it straight away.  It tasted good to us.  The next day, my 16th birthday, I went into a hut to warm the coffee (ground acorns) for breakfast.  It was about half past seven.  Up went a patent coffee pot full of boiling coffee.  All this went over my face.  Oh I was a pretty looking creature.</p>
