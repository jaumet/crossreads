<p>[26th Aug. contd]<br/>Down into the next valley &amp; in due course arrived at Senninghem where the people apparently had never seen Australian before.  An incident here.  I pushed into an estaminet to purchase some fruit.  Three Tommy Segts were sitting down &amp; we [were] possibly billeted there.  As soon as the lady of the place caught sight of me she hustled me out in spite of my protestations.  She though I wanted beer and the hours for liquor are 12 to t &amp; 6 to 8 daily.  One of our boys got annoyed at this &amp; told her in Australian that we have burnt down places for less than that.</p>
<p>We dragged ourselves away &amp; were chatting to a NZ outside and suddenly the old dame came rushing out &amp; could not do enough for us &ndash; inquiring whether we were staying in the village etc.  Her sudden change of mind was phenomenal .  However we ended square there as we left the village laden with 2 hatfuls of apples for a franc &amp; distributed them to Tommies on the road.  One Tommy on guard though couldn't be induced to pick up two we threw him.  In time we arrived at Lambres &amp; after some trouble got an excellent meal at Caf&eacute; Francais &amp; waiting for the Boulogne train to arrive we got some papers &amp; caught the midget train again.</p>
