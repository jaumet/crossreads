 Sunday 9 December 1917 Off duty 2-5 p.m., went to Mouski with S. Brown (E) &amp; loved it &ndash; shopped on Sunday for 1st time &ndash; 2 napkin rings, Pt. 5 each, drove home &amp; duty alone 5 to 8.  This I like as peace reigns even if Matron does extensive &amp; interviews every pt. &amp; asks temp. etc.  C. Grant very helpful &amp; nice answering questions about pts. &amp; telling of his woe at losing cases with secondary haem. as has been the case so often.  No church for poor me today but hymns of the nicest &amp; most soothing at 11 &amp; 7 p.m., so must be content. My acquaintance grows with these sisters.  Yesterday had 3 invitations out with them &amp; am so glad as it is human life one enjoys &amp; not this cold stiffness that have had ever since leaving Australia.
