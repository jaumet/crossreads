  
 fellow. I went to Confession as opportunity offered. 
 16/7/16  Sunday Went to Mass at 6 am at the Church opposite our Dressing Station - Our Interpreter said Mass. No sleep last night, going as hard as we could, with 2 Doctors - Before going to Mass we had a lull & then started afresh, by 9 am we had handled some 150 Patients, some awful cases, men not recognizable, several cases of noses blown right off, to say nothing of fractures - shock etc. Had two cases of shock in particular who were painful to watch, just a bundle of nerves & ready to cow at the slightest noise. 
 57th & 58th must have lost heavily last night. The Germans blew our very poor parapets down in several places & treated them to Gas, Aerial Torpedoes - Plum Puddings - Mortars - Shrapnel & the full variety of their stock. Unfortunately the only backing they had was the 15th Artillery with 18 ponders & they took hardly any effect, in fact
