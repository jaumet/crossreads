<p>Before us lies an adventure unprecedented in modern war.  Together with our comrades of the fleet, we are about to force a landing upon an open beach in face of positions which have been vaunted, by our enemies as impregnable.  The landing will be made good by the help of God &amp; the navy.  The positions will be stormed &amp; the war brought one step nearer to a glorious close.
