<p>Attended Church Parade this morning &amp; am spending the rest of the day lounging about.<br/>The weather is frightfully hot &amp; seems to strike right through the Tent.<br/>To-morrow our Fellow Comrades in Arms leave us &amp; to this end we are holding a rather convivial kind of party to-night tendered to the W.O. &amp; 6 Sergeants who are going with the men.  I suppose it will last until the early hours of the morning so I am going to have a snooze now.<br/>Fierce fighting is proceeding in France.  Ammunition Ship blown up in Port-Said.</p>
<p>28.2.16 Monday<br/>We had our beano last night &amp; I have a very sore head to-day through same.  They are all departing to-day &amp; are having their last meal in the old camp to-day.<br/>It is hard to part with them, as I have trained them all to the best of my ability &amp; am proud of them.<br/>Lieut  Brigden called on me today from Ferry Post on the canal where he is situated.  To-day we heard that 13 Transports left Suez bound for the Persian Gulf &amp; all loaded with troops.  This means that there will soon be something doing</p>
