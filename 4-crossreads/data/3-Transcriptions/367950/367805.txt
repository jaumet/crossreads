To explain: I saw in several shops which have ivory carvings for sale a piece of pure ivory, the exact size and shape of a tennis ball with <u>eight</u> balls carved inside it. I saw plenty with 5 and 6 but the one with 8 balls inside was the most wonderful The thickness of each ball would be about 1/16 of an inch in thickness and each one was not only cut out but beautifully engraved. The last one (the eighth) was about &frac14; of an inch in diameter like a small marble each ball was separate, each moved at the touch These wonderful ivory balls are made by the Chinese who alone possess the secret.</p>
