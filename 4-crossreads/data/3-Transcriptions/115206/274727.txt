<p>June 1918<br/>Thursday 6</p>
<p>Battery W.Lines.  near Pont Noyelles<br/>Weather beautiful. Received a packet from Mrs Felton, a letter.<br/>Very pleased to read that BIlling M.P. was acquitted. Seems there  is a sorry state of affairs in the English aristocracy. <br/>Visited and sang at a concert in the open, near 113th Hows [howitzer]  Waggon Lines. Quite a good concert, no lack of artists. <br/>Ran across Robbie, North and Theo Meillon. Smith arrived from Guns for the afternoon.<br/>Scottie Malcolm went up to the guns</p>
