<p>Tues Mar 26<br/>Fierce fighting continues. The war news is very serious, but everyone seems confident.</p>
<p>Wed March 27th<br/>Germans capture Albert. This time last year we were there, at Bellevue Farm, and it is hard to realise that Fritz has it again.</p>
<p>Thurs 28<br/>Bill Beards and the Cook went on Leave. Flanagan cooked the dinner and it went off fairly well. Very wild night.</p>
<p>The Battle is still raging in France, but our chaps are holding. Fritz back a bit now.</p>
