<p>Saturday, 27 February, 1915<br/>Cleaned saddlery in the morning.  I gave my girths &amp; saddle flaps a good softening this time.</p>
<p>I went on French leave into Cairo and had a game of tennis at British club then went to tea at Mrs O'B and spent an enjoyable evening arriving home  at 2.30  am, as the  police [military police] all turn in after midnight.  Preparations are being made for a departure shortly since some of the infantry are going this week.  The Allied fleet bombarded the Dardanelles yesterday and forced an entrance.  This looks as if we may go to Constantinople, and remain there as an army of occupation.  I hope not as we all want to see the front.</p>
<p>Sunday, 28 February, 1915<br/>On M.P. all day and as soon as I went out I sat down and did some writing including a letter home.  I had some friends out to see me and after Retreat went home with them.  I returned home very late and was chased by military police on 2 occasions, but I gave them both the slip.</p>
<p>The 3rd Brigade left for Alexandria to night, and I saw them off.  No one seems to know where they are going not even their officers. Some say the Dardanelles, Syria, Jaffa, Alexandretta, Marseilles, Brussels &amp; Southampton that is our present position.</p>
