Stayed indoors all the morning but did a short promenade after lunch - the scenery is uninteresting though. At 4 and again at 5 held conferences regarding our forthcoming march and other matters. At mess Abercrombie came in and started his usual fierce arguments. A merry meal was mess as always. Afterwards to my bureau and find that now I have 23rd. as well as my own matters to attend to. The incoming of the "Time" afforded reading matter enough till 8.30 and I looked in at the Picture YMCA show.
