Went to bed after a brace hand gallop over the field and slept until about 10.20 when Hunt brought some breakfast . Then slept on till 1 pm when the C.O. return from an F.G.C.M. in the afternoon put the whole battalion through wire travers with mat and the keep of their wave after passag of obstacl .
