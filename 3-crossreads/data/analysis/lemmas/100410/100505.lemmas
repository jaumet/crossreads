 ( 3 ) Blind God , who gave the world it 's fair , Swoon sea and ardent sky ; Fashion it with everi rare That could dazzl human eye ; God , who gave me all of these , Help me do without them pleas . Giver of the light and flower , Run stream and forest tree , Help me through the heavi hour , When I think what other see . God , Who took my sight away Help me do without it , pray . The Cost Take back the honour and the fame , The victori we ve won , Take all the credit from my name , If this can be undon ? Let him , my friend that use to be Somehow be given back to me . Do n't mock me with the pride of it , The glori of his death , I onli know he sigh a bit - I felt him catch his breath . O God , if miracl can be , May he be given back to me !
