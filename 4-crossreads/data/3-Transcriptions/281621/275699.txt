<p>Sunday 20<br/>Since last Sunday night I have been in bed in B.4 Ward &amp; looked after O.K. The nurses, VADs are very good</p>
<p>Monday 21<br/> &amp; the sisters vary. The head sister told me off a treat a few days ago for getting out of bed, but Sister Dobson has already introduced me to a very nice friend, who I think will be a lasting friend, Miss Jelly. The Officer in charge of the ward is Sir Alfred Pearce Gould a very eminent surgeon. <br/>The weather lately</p>
<p>Tuesday 22<br/>has been wet &amp; thundery, but now it is again beautiful. Our ward is decorated with very nice flowers tulips, roses &amp; lilac. A character of an outback Australian occupies the bed opposite to mine. He knows Burro[indecipherable] &amp; is a typical shearer &amp; the way he speaks to the head sister is very amusing.</p>
