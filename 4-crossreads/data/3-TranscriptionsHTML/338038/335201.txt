<p>Our old Colonel R. is going strong and as enthusiastic a soldier as ever. Saw Rex Rabeth in Cairo  He is getting on allright and should be back to duty before long &ndash;</p>
<p>Well, Mother dear, we seem to be just where we started in Egypt over 12 months ago, and lets hope the next scrap we are in will be something better than Anzac. 12 months seems a long time to be away from home but the coming home will be all the better when it comes.</p>
<p>I do hope Mum that your sight is improved since your letter. You must, if you havent already, go and have your eyes tested, and try and get some glasses to suit you.</p>
<p>I must say goodnight now as my correspondence this week is unusually large.</p>
<p>With fondest love, I am your Son Terence</p>
