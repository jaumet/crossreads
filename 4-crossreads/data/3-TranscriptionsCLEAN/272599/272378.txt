 Heavy rain last night, also continuance of heavy bombardments. Duties as usual. A very cold raw windy day. When will the weather take up?  Here we are in the middle of April & tis as cold & wet as at Xmas.  Sunny France  --- where is it? Its the sorriest, dreariest place in the universe just now at any rate here at the front.
