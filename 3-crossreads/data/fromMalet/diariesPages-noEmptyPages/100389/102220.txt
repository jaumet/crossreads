rouge met us and handed us coffee & cake. It was well appreciated and as we were leaving, the whole train gave them a hearty cheer. The name of this place was Palaiseau. Versailles was reached by 5 pm and after a few minutes stop we rattled on till we reached Epluches arriving at 7.20. We stayed here about an hour leaving at 8.30 pm.
Practically the whole of the populace was around us asking for "souvenirs". RL
At 10.30 pm we passed through Criel one of the biggest stations on the line and at 5 am on the 14th inst arrived at Abbeville, where we detrained horses and vehicles and left for camp about 2 miles distant, arriving about 8.45 am. I was indeed sorry to leave the train as I would have liked to go on forever. 
In the evening Andy O’Neil & I went up the town, but as we were both leg weary did not stay long.
15th Gee whiz! though it is now mid-summer, it is bitterly cold which is quite a change to the intense heat
