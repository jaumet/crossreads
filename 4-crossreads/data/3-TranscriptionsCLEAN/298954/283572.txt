 The prisoner's trust in the British Navy has been sorely shaken by the safe return of "Wolf" to Germany, but despite the irritation the tension has now lifted - all are glad that the issue has been decided in some manner.   The strangest thing is the attitude of the German crew - they seem by no means delighted at the proximity of the Fatherland. 
 And naturally, since they will be drafted either to other raiders or to submarines after a short holiday. 
 "Wolf" is pushing down the coast of Schleswig-Holstein. 
 She is quite unescorted - many fishing craft in the offing. 
 What is apparently the mainland is clearly visible on our starboard beam.   It is a clear, bright wintry day - the little red roofed towns with their windmills and fir-tree backgrounds are quite free from snow.
