<p>see you some day &amp; tell you all about me. Hope my different friends are not troubling you, if so write &amp; let me know. Mind you keep on the telephone &amp; pay for it out of my money. I cam manage very well with my pay, hope to be able to save a little soon. Trust you are not feeling the hard times too much. We have just heard good news. The French &amp; British have advanced 12 miles in France, hope it is true. I'm sending a few photos with Sister Ralston, keep them until I return &amp; I can explain them. Think I have told you all the news &amp; my arm is very tired &ndash; Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all &amp; hope you are all well. From your loving sister Edith.</p>
