<p>you have scratched through them.<br/>Wilkie Hickson was hit with shrapnel but I think went to Malta.<br/>Geo. Henderson another of my sergeants and my chemist in Newcastle was hit here.  I gave him my card to send you, if he goes your way.  If he does I know you will have an eye on him.  I'm lost without him.<br/>I hope Will is keeping allright &amp; that B.C. is happy amongst her mates.<br/>I am at present A.D.M.S. of this division.  The other chap got sick and went off so I am running the show.  I rather hope he won't come back.  This is a nice change and gives me a chance of a [indecipherable] work, but after we lick the Turks I'm off however.<br/>Best love to you all<br/>Your affect'n uncle<br/>Joseph L. Ruskin</p>
