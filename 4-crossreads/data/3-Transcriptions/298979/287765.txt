<p>"engineers" &amp; quietly pointed out how things were.</p>
<p>Two other men had taken the youngsters places &amp; were working away as fast as possible, when this working Engineer, notwithstanding the presence of the officer, came walking along &amp; called out, Here! What the devil are you doing! Do you want to break that pump! You know you can't go to a shop &amp; buy another? What idiot told you to work a pump in that silly manner! Stop at once! I'm responsible for that!</p>
<p>He then showed how the stroke must be a very slow one otherwise the plunger will not go to its full length &amp; it would be impossible to lift the proper weight of water. Of course all the men had a good "hearty" "grin" but the officer simply turned &amp; walked away. When the pump was "handled" in a proper manner the work was not nearly so laborious &amp; the amount of water lifted was just doubled.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes after this incident the officer came back &amp; very officiously called to the youngster who had insulted him &amp; taking out his note-book, wanted to know his Name Number, Battalion etc. These were given.</p>
<p>Do you know where your battalion is? said the officer<br/>Yes! said the youngster.<br/>Where? asked the officer.<br/>In the line, not 200 yards away! said the youngster.</p>
<p>As the Battalion was really better off there, than where the workers were, &amp; were certainly having a much easier time in the line, the officer who could only send the youngster back, would not do so under these circumstances so he pocketed his insult, &amp; the youngster remained one of the party till the end.</p>
<p>It did not take long for it to be noticed &amp; remarked that this officer would never go up into the trench when there was any shelling going on, but after it had passed &amp; was miles away on the right or left, he would not only come up into the trench but would mount the steps &amp; stand up on the parapet &amp; striking an almost Napoleonic attitude, would gaze quietly &amp; serenely at the distant shelling</p>
