  
 22 May, 1916 Katia  11.0 am We saddled up & moved off at 7.0 this morning - it was the usual old bustle but we are getting used that now.  Joe Woods did not come with us this time Harold went with the Signalers who are short of men.  We came on here to Katia & watered our horses & have had an early meal as we might have to go out on Out post any minute.  I hear that we move of from here at 7 or 8 this evening it will be a bit better travelling at night.  There is a nice breeze blowing & it is nice & cool in the shade of the palms.
