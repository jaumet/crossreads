<p>France 25 April 1917<br/>PART VI &ndash; 1st. January, 1917, to 25th. April, 1917<br/>On the Somme &amp; rest periods.</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>Tomorrow being Anzac Day, I thought that it would be a good idea &amp; most appropriate to copy out the 6th Edition of the Diary, as the 2nd copy also dated from the 1st January to Anzac Day.  It scarcely seems 12 months since we had that Sports Meeting at Duntroon Plateau, &amp; what an eventful year it has been.  It all seems like a dream &amp; hard to realize the trying ordeals that we have experienced since the 25th April 1916.   This Edition will be much shorter than the others, as for about 9 weeks I was at our Rest Station, &amp; of course there was nothing startling to report from this quarter.   Just the same old routine day after day.</p>
<p>Beautiful Spring Weather has greeted us for the last 5 days the Sun has been shining with all its splendour.   It is very pleasant to have such beautiful days, after the miserable &amp; cold weather that we have experienced for the last 6 months.  The weather at present, makes a fellow think that after all, lifes worth while.<br/>Love From Langford.</p>
