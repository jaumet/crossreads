 I wish you could see me in my GAS MASK like a Teddy bear will send you a photo if possible &ndash; all ranks are issued with them. 
 Night march on SHELLAL infantry attack GAZA at dawn. 
 Arrived SHELLAL 5 A.M. My Squadron left Flank Guard. Good country &ndash; large quantity of cultivation Barley &amp; Wheat &ndash; Grasses including all I gave before plus BARLEY &amp; TIMOTHY Umbrella &amp; Couch. Just been over to the 6th L.H. to see some old friends. They tell me they will meet me in the Hospital Clearing Station tomorrow &ndash; Cheerful.
