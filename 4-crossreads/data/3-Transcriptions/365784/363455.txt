<p>My dear Mrs Langer Owen</p>
<p>I have been talking to an officer, a Sydney man named Olding who has just returned wounded from the Dardanelles.</p>
<p>He, like others here, complains of the terrible sufferings of our men on their way back here after they have been wounded. They come in ordinary transports &ndash; This officer came back 3 days ago with a shrapnel wound in the head. On his boat The Frankonia (a Cunarder) were 1346 wounded men 3 doctors &amp; 26 orderlies were all the medical help for these poor fellows. On arriving at the shore from the trenches, tunics shirts etc were cut away to allow of 1st aid being rendered. On the boat the men wore their bandages &amp; blankets as there were no pyjamas or shirts for them &amp; of course you may imagine very many got no attention at all. They were 3 days &amp; 3 nights enroute. Now had we a hospital ship &ndash; &amp; a quick boat or rather several much could be done.</p>
<p>They need these ships badly for our men, &amp; they could be fitted up here. Also in the trenches they want notepaper &amp; envelopes, pencils (indelible) cigarettes match lighters</p>
