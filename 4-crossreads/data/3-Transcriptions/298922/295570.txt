<p>Monday 17 September 1917</p>
<p>Alex:<br/>Today I spent at the MOUZAM Gardens, &amp; in the Orchid house. Alexandria is having one of their best "seasons", all Greeks etc. have made much money &amp; spend it on clothes etc. - &amp; jewellery. Every Hotel &amp; Pension is full <strike>from</strike> of people from the interior or far away as the Soudan.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]<br/>Letter from Dolly today dated Aug. 30th. She did not know I'm on my way home. I was never so impatient at delay &amp; for two pins I'd go into some Camp for duty but a few hours notice is all we get. Am reading Romany Rye &amp; getting a lot of letters written I owe.</p>
