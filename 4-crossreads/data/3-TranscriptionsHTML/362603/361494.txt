<p>Bulford<br/>23.7.17<br/>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,<br/>I am Orderly Corporal To-night &amp; have to get all the Defaulters to work but I have left them to carry on while I write to You.  I also sneaked away &amp; had an Hour at the Cricket Nets.  On Friday last I had to give evidence at a D.C.M. at Hurdcott.  I had left my Bike in Salisbury so I got the Train there &amp; rode the 7 miles to Hurdcott &amp; back.  I was pretty sweaty when I arrived back at The Close but after a wash and a cup of Tea I was right.  I was on Duty then I sat down &amp; made the Two girls mow the Lawn while I overseered.  I rode Home at 10.15 pm &amp; some coon took me a short cut which turned out to be 2 &frac12; miles further.  It was a nice ride though.  I have a nice lamp on my Bike &amp; The trees melt over-head &amp; the Hedges are 20 feet high most of the way Home, so It was just like riding through a dark cavern nearly all the Time.  It only took me 70 minutes to ride the 12 &frac12; or 13 miles.  I was unlucky on Friday though, Eric Hynde one of our Club mates was over &amp; He asked Ellis a question while His back was Turned &amp; when Ellis turned round He nearly dropped dead.  Reg. Keirle was over to march to a Funeral on Sunday.  He</p>
