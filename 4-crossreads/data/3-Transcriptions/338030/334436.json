<p>where I was, completely uprooting a huge tree, with a diameter of at least 4 feet, which came down with a crash. Pieces of dirt, etc., fell round about me. We got the order to shift our horses to a safer place for the time being.<br/>On Sunday night, 15/4/17, we were hauled out of bed at 10 p.m., harnessed up our horses and proceeded to the battery, where we stood by till 7 a.m., in case the Germans hopped over, as the infantry at this point was not strong enough to repel an attack. I had breakfast and got to bed at 8 a.m., but was pulled out at 11.30 a.m., and after harnessing up our horses, stood by the guns till 6 p.m. I then went to bed (as it is best to get a bit of sleep when possible) but was pulled out at 1.45 a.m., to shift the guns, which we did before daybreak, arriving back at 6.30 a.m. I had breakfast and went to bed, but was pulled out at 7.45 a.m., to take a load of ammunition to the guns, arriving back at 10.30 a.m. Turned into bed, but was pulled out at 1.45 p.m., to go for a load of ammunition, arriving back at 4.30 p.m.<br/>We got rather a bad spin of food here, as we were only issued with a very small quantity of bread, and biscuits were unobtainable, and the nearest place where anything could be  bought was Albert- about 20 miles away, so you can guess that we felt the pinch.<br/>On Tuesday night, at 11.30, we were pulled out of bed to harness up and stand by the guns all night, in case the Germans hopped over. Unharnessed at 7 a.m. next morning.<br/>Every village that we come across has been destroyed by</p>
