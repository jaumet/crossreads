Dear Miss Clark
Just a note while I have the chance.  We are out of the line resting and staying at a farm.  We have had grand weather lately, sunny days & cool nights.  Green is everywhere, and the scenery is pleasant, but further up towards the line, there is ruin all round.  Farms & Houses smashed to pieces.  I wrote to you from England.  I hope that you receive the letters.  Write when you can and I will do my best to answer your letters.  They are things we look forward to very much.  I got 2 letters from Mary when I was in the line facing the Hun, and I was very glad to get them.  I hope that you & your Sister & Mother are well.  Give them my best wishes and I hope to be able to see you all when we get
