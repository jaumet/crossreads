Sunday 1 December
A walk round the Station there a scene of desolation wreckage is to be seen, scarcely imagined. Trucks railway lines are thrown yards away it is the greatest bit of destruction I have seen.
Monday 2 December
Fine day I took advantage of it to run into Muageuge, the great Frontier fort of this district. It is indeed some fortress the ramparts are very solid indeed. The streets are narrow the town old fashioned.
