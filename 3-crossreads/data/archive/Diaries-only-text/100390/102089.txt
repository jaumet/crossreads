Nothing else of note ? dreary routine our horses more unfit each day. 
We are now on Army rations Bully beef biscuit. The latter hard as the Kaisers heart. 
Our men gamble persistently ? sometimes all night the destroyers torpedo boats [indecipherable] to fro. Pinnaces dropping boats full of troop passengers. 
[Hand drawn sketch of several boats in convoy.]
Nothing else of note except that tomorrow I may go ashore to the island.
