<p>was too good an opportunity for scribbling a letter ot two to miss&#151;so I did not see the sports. In the evening however, we had a double Quartette, "The End of a Perfect Day", ditto "The Soldier's Farewell", both beautifully rendered.<br/>Then some parodies on Dixie Land, etc., then "If I had a thousand hearts", by an American we have with us. There were also solos, duets, and recitations, and scarcely an item was below the high water-mark of the first two that I have mentioned. There was no piano; yet in the quiet twilight, the men reclining on the grassy slope by the side of the creek, bordered with hawthorn and brier roses, there seemed to be something in the voices that a piano would have almost marred. I wish you could have heard them. I hope someday we shall sit on the same grassy bank and talk of the old times.<br/>SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE,<br/>15th June,1916.<br/>It is 10 a.m. Monday. Just about midnight last night had a sudden call to go out to the gun pits in charge of several wagons of ammunition. We arrived home again about 3.30 a.m. and then found a big lot of ammunition from the D.A.0.waiting to be unloaded into our now empty wagons. We got to our beds somewhere between 4 and 5 o'clock. In consequence, we have this morning off. I have just finished breakfast, and not a bad one either. It is the salle a manger (a mixture of kitchen and dining room on a farm) of an old farm where I am seated, one of the biggest farms round here,(that is they own about 20 acres and do not live in a mud and thatch cottage).</p>
