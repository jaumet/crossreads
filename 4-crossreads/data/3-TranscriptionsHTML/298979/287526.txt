<p>knew nothing &amp; would do nothing.</p>
<p>However the officer eventually was directed to where most of them could be found &amp; he mustered up about 100. As there was still a huge stack of stuff to be shifted &amp; as we had previously helped the Pioneers to build the Railway line, about 50 of these who were also "hanging around", were joined up &amp; the Stuff was loaded on to trucks &amp; sent down over the railway to be carried at the end about 200 yards.</p>
<p>In the course of this line there were three, only three, trees, but after the first truck had been loaded &amp; sent on its journey it was found that the line had been laid to pass so close to the trees (with a field on either side) that the truck had clearance, but not the load. By prising, pulling &amp; canting, the load was forced past the first tree but had to be unloaded at the second.</p>
<p>As this was one of the "spots" exposed to Machine Gun fire, which with one further on, had been responsible for 16 Casualties amongst the Pioneers up till then, the unloading &amp; reloading of that truck was quite a "lively time" &amp; if a man could not find a place between the load &amp; the Machine Gun post, "his lace had come undone" &amp; wanted refastening, &amp; it was rather surprising how long this took &amp; how many had become loose. As the load became less, the speed with which the material was taken off was wonderful. The truck was then pushed past "the spot" &amp; reloaded. A messenger being sent back to warn the loaders of the trucks to follow, in order to avoid the same troubles.</p>
<p>The truck was shoved along merrily till at a fairly level patch after passing the third "Obstacle" the truck ran off the line through the rail spreading because the joint was not properly screwed "home".</p>
<p>We soon found out why! This</p>
