 Feel O.K.  Shoulder better.  X Ray again for 2 plates.  Dr Harvey took my photo showing spots.  Warned that I am going to Harefield some time this week.  Visiting day.  Mrs James and Mrs Humphries called again with usual nice things, which were greatly appreciated.  M.O. decided that it is better to leave the pieces of shell in face and head as to remove them would probably cause more trouble than leaving them there.
