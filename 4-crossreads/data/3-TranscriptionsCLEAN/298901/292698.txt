  
 It was wonderfully interesting as I saw large numbers of French troops moving up to the line amongst them being the famous Alpine Chasseurs, France's crack troops.  The were dressed in dark blue & wore tamoshanter caps, being a smart & young looking body of men their officers also being  a fine looking lot. I listened to their bands for some time which were playing as the troops marched by, they using a step much quicker than ours.  The trumpeters were particularly good, brandishing their instruments with great gusto. In equipment they much resembled the German, in such things as entrenching tool in particular & their machine guns appeared to be the same, they being carried on light mules.  A few British troops in the neighbourhood did not compare well with these fine fellows & it was distinctly cheering & heartening to see such fine men available at this stage of the war.  Bought some papers, U.S.A as well ,also
