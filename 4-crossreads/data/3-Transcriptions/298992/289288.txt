<p>With reference to the Radio-gram re the collection by Samarai Branch and Nelsson &amp; Shedden Woodlark Island of 25% on all Brisbane and Cairns freights. &ndash; I did not get this message till after our departure from Samarai, and consequently could not inform Mr. Aumuller of it until our return from Woodlarks.</p>
<p>I understand that Mr Kennedy has written you fully telling you how satisfactorily the cargo was discharged at Woodlark Island. Most of the Timber was floated to Boi-Boi, to be transported to the sight of the Wireless Station as required. The "Annie" &ndash; which we towed up from Samarai with us &ndash; took all the cement in her holds thus protecting it from the weather. We were fortunate in not having any rain to hamper the discharge of the big cargo, otherwise we might have found it difficult to have got away on the Saturday.</p>
<p>We missed the "Matunga" at Samarai, she having sailed on the Saturday previous to our arriving there, also the "Misima" which we saw steaming away as we came abreast of the Island.</p>
<p>Twenty-one tons of Coal were dumped on the Wharf at Samarai for the "Misima" before we went to Woodlark Island, and another forty-nine tons on our return, making in all 70 Tons,</p>
