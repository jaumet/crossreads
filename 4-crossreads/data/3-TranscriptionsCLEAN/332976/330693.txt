April 19166th   The Engrs are doing the fatigue and guard of the ship to-day & I am Sgt. of the guard.  The weather is clearing up considerably but the wind is very cold.We are now 150+ miles off land & don't expect to see land before Colombo.8th   We sighted land unexpectedly this morning & passed the "White Top Rocks" at about 1 PM and Cape Lewin about 7.30 PM.  The sight of land came as a surprise to most on board as it was rumoured yesterday that we would keep too far out to see it.  A steamer passed us on the Starboard side about 8.30 P.M.
