(Another washout)<br/>Last Sunday a number of our aeroplanes left Kantara for the purpose of bombing Al-arish.  They met with a Hot reception &amp;amp; though in force could do very little good owing to the High Explosives used by the Turks.  2 of our Planes had to come to the ground &amp;amp; were destroyed by our own Men who afterwards got back safely.  Our Machines at present are very much inferior in size &amp;amp; power than the Taubes, &amp;amp; can only travel 60 miles an Hour at full speed.
