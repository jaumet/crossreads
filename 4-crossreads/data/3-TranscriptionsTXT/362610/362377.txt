Saturday 10 June 1916Storm clouds during the morning, but a fine day, the afternoon being specially good. Work of the school continued, live grenades & bombs being used & found very interesting. At 4 o'clock Leo came over bringing a mail that he had just received, including home letters dated 17th April which were most enjoyable : my own have probably gone down to the base so I may not receive them until after coming out of the trenches.
