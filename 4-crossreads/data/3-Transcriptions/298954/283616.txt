<p>Thu. 4th Apl (cont.)<br/>I welcomed Monsieur to our humble abode and we both set to on a pile of potatoes brought up by a filthy Russian orderly &ndash; supplemented by "Milkmaid Brand" cocoa and milk.   Then we slept-soundly.</p>
<p>Fri. 5th</p>
<p>Lieut. Astor, of the French Flying Corps, (my stable-companion,) and I spent today locked in our room with nothing to do but talk to each other in my ridiculous French and broken German.   Astor does not speak English.   He "crashed" when raiding on the Front &amp; has been in hospital at Hanover for months.</p>
<p>Sat. 6th<br/>We found out today that this depot is where all officer-prisoners are kept for interrogation purposes, after which they are drafted all over Germany, usually via the prison-camp-proper in this city, which is situated in the Stadt Garten as an air-raid screen for the Grand Ducal Palace and the city of Karlsruhe.</p>
