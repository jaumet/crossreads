  
 Princess St. we purchased a few postcards and two Glengarry badges which I forwarded - one to home & M.B. We missed the run of Eric & Bill and finding our way back to house we left our parcels and proceeded again to Railway Station to met Bill's brother Tom from Glasgow and his sister Kate from Newcastle.  Went to wrong station - Princess St. instead of Waverley and met Miss Edyth Wilson a singer from Chatham - Joe was also with me. Leaving Station at 7.20 we proceeded later on to Braids Hill Rd. and saw numerous people playing golf.  An excellent view is also seen from top of Braids Hill. Returning about 10 p.m. I was introduced to the newcomers and chatted until 2 p.m. [a.m. ?] Wednesday 26th To town with boys in morning to East Coast Railway Office to make enquiries re tickets. Posted the two glengarry badges ("Cairn-gorrum" [possibly Cairngorm] stones).  Walk thro East Gardens and saw Scotts Monument and the Flower Clock which of course keeps proper time.  Dinner at Victoria League Club.  Very enjoyable Selections from phonograph. Met Kate and Eric together with Kate's friend Fanny Moss (of Scarborough) who is employed at Jenners a similar place to Farmers in Sydney.  Thence by motor to Forth Bridge and was very well pleased by the size of bridge.
