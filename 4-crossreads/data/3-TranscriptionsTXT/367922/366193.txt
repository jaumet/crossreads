4.at all. I cannot tell you how I would love to be in the march into Constantinople/
Out bous are leaving to-night at 12 o'clock for Alexandria, and I daresay will go right on then to the Dardenelles. Of course a lot of this is only conjecturs and rumour, but the main points are right. It is quite on the books that they will be camped at Alexandria some weeks in which case I shall perhaps get a chance to join up with them again. I only trust it is so, though its a poor chance.
Tommy is not going. He has had a shift to the Orderly Room at Headquarters, amongst the "nobs" and I do not see very much of him now.
Am enclosing a little poem I happened on.
The cuttings were more than welcome. All the lads round about me had a great old time as well as myself reading them.
I have been a very long time over this letter, and if it does read a bit disjointed, remember that I am not quite myself to-day, and cannot help thinking of my not being in with the boys when they strike "trouble", probably in a few days.
I have not had a letter from Mother or Dene or Hazel yet. Ask them to write. You cannot imagine how we look forward to mail day here. It's almost the only bright spot in this awful place.
Give my very best love to all the family, and don't worry. I'll be alright soon now.
Your loving son,Alan.
