<p>We going to be good little boys &amp; do what daddy says &ndash; if he wants us to coal ship, transfer cargo, launch boats, stoke fires or swim ashore &amp; duck for the tall timber on the other side the ramp &ndash; well we're to do it &amp; say nixsy. Fact is we've been poking borak at Fritz for being bottled up, blockaded etc . Now Fritz has got it on us good &amp; strong &amp; its us to sit back &amp; [indecipherable] low.<br/>There are this evening, just 20 ships in. There is a 35 knot beauty outside &amp; we dont want to see her.<br/>13th / [indecipherable] Another big Frenchman, much stained &amp; battered, just in. She looks bad &ndash; very sick.<br/>Other ships in offing.<br/>1.30. There seems to be a sort of fleet arriving. One more of the boats that left on the 4th ran in at dinner time. She was followed by a castle boat (well filled) a mail boat and a Britisher. The latter is some ship &amp; should be equal to any Deutcher afloat.&ndash;  a Great cruiser of the latest, light but mighty dangerous looking.<br/>Other arrivals during afternoon &amp; evening &ndash; a Shire boat, two Cays Steamers and a big ship of the Marathon type. Three small colliers brought the total of our harbor ornaments to 31.</p>
