me to finish, so I brought the engine in put her away signing off at 1 am. I was not required for duty again until Saturday at 2.30 Pm when I did a shift on the yard shunter until 10 Pm when I again signed off at 11 Pm remained off duty until today Tuesday April 30th when I signed on at 12.30 Pm on a Banking Engine up to 4 Pm was not required so remained in the siding. After a period of nearly three weeks of quietness, there being nothing of interest to report, as I had been dong Local Banking Work had a good time, working 8 to 10 hours at a time, I now start to relate an another somewhat startling experience. On Friday May 17th 1918, I was booked on a run to shunt the Balloon Siding near a village called Campain left the Depot at 1.30 arrived there at 2.30 Pm as there were no work to do, we made ourselves comfortable in a shady spot as it was fairly warm. At about 4 Pm we went over to see an Observation Balloon brought out of a Hanger, which is really a very high shed to be tested in the Air. The O.C. went around examining the Balloon then the boys in charge of the ropes allowed it to rise the O.C. climbed into the Basket the Balloon which was also attached to a cable on a Motor Car was let up in the higher the O.C. was testing the rope gear, after satisfying himself all was correct the Balloon was returned to the hanger
