<p>Thursday 16 January 1919<br/>Rain again last night but the sand absorbs it.<br/>Dolly now writes she thinks she would like to sail next month for Australia &ndash; will cable you when she does &amp; hope it won't be too hot in Deniliquin for her in March.  Nothing definite re myself but I have hopes of being home by then.  Not much chance of our sailing together.<br/>Played a game of Polo yesterday, am not much good but like it very much.</p>
