Eggs are very dear 2/6 per dozen &amp; Butter in Francs 20 Centimes for 1 Kilogramme which is a little over 2 lbs. Oranges were 5 C too dear. It was very amusing to see the way they handle the Rabbits, of course they are born in Captivity &amp; they sit in open baskets &amp; not a move out of them, they are handled by their owner &amp; replaced again &amp; they seem quite contented n their baskets. Fowls &amp; ducks have their legs tied &amp; are placed on the ground. Clothes are in some cases are laying on a canvas covering on the ground &amp; dust &amp; filth is blowing all over them, the owners don't seem to mind. They pay so much for the use of the grounds from 50 Cents</p>
