  
 391 And Charlie is the only one left out of his - The specialist told me that I'd be able to pass the army test when he was finished with me - He also told me that Lord Roberts used to be one of his patients and that he could only see out of one eye - He is a charming man and bucked me up considerably 
 It is a beautiful day here and I wish it was last Saturday over again - I enjoyed every minute of the week end I had with you and hope to repeat it when I get fixed up - I had a letter from Winifred Ryrie this morning, she is coming to see me when she goes to London - I also had a letter from Aunt Maria which must be answered at once - I'm writing to Aunt Isabel today - I wont write any more just now - my eye is watering like fun - Thank Lea Joker for her kind regards in your letter and Bobbie thank her ever so much for her love and message in your letter - I think of all three of you often through the day - Take great care of yourselves - my love  to Ann and R and Mrs Watson - all my fondest love to you both - Ever your devoted brother Gib
