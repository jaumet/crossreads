<p>Leaving here for the streets I encountered such an infernal din as I never heard before. Every kind of noise making instrument seemed to have been concentrated in streets &amp; whistles &amp; etc add to enlivement. [Hacman] voices are too weak to be heard in the din</p>
<p>The fireworks display contains fire portraits of King &amp; Queen &amp; beautiful rocket displays but cannot equal the display on the other side of the channel. Then English display cost &pound;20,000 the other must has cost &pound;100,000 or more</p>
<p>As room is not certain to night &amp; stretcher is all I can expect I do not go home but try RAC &amp; am advised to go to Savoy Baths which I do. This is really a Turkish Baths but the cubicles used to recline on are used for sleeping apartments by night, a cooker is kept on premises &amp; breakfast can be obtained so it is as good as an hotel.</p>
<p>My word I have slept in some queer places since leaving Aussie.</p>
<p>20-7-19<br/>Leaving Baths at 12 30, I do not know what to do &amp; decide to visit Madelins friend Miss Gallagher &amp;</p>
