<p>31<br/>me.</p>
<p>I remember an incident in the huts that I became concerned in, a certain chap in our hut became a corporal. He wasn't liked very much among the men and they took no trouble to conceal their antipathy to him. The same chap wasn't cleanly in his habits at all. He was thrown into the river at Liverpool because he wouldn't have a bath. He in his turn did all that he could to make the most of the position and used to order the men about.</p>
<p>One night, coming unexpectedly into the tent I found him with a gun in his hands, also a bullet. He told me that he was about to commit suicide and that my coming into the tent had just prevented him &ndash; the perpetration of the deed. Thinking things</p>
