August Monday 27 1917 
Duties per usual. Full day on. Heavy work. Tumble off to bed as soon as relieved. Some very bad cases in ward. Likely to be some deaths in a day or two. 
A fine specimen of a Londoner, Diss, by name lies like a log with a fractured - spine. He is one of the finest built men I've ever seen only 23 too. The waste pity of it.
