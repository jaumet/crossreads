<p>consequence of such a fine, &amp; he did, &amp; he said he would remain where he was.</p>
<p>The Sentry was afterwards informed by Machine Gunner J[dash] with whom he came home to Australia on the Hospital Ship Ayrshire in July 1917, that every one of the 129 men (left behind) who had paraded sick (&amp; he was one of them) had been forced to go through some hours physical drill. This order came from the same Staff Captain who had drilled the sick men at Fleurbaix, he knew better than the Doctor what was good for men parading sick after an action in which the Captain took no part whatever except as a Staff officer in a dug out miles back</p>
<p>The day following this "physical Jerks" medicine M/Gunner J[dash] had to be sent to Hospital thence to England &amp; eventually to Australia M/G J[dash] did not know how the others fared afterwards, but <u>that</u> kind of "medicine" gave him his chance to get back.</p>

He examined the first man then turned to the Sentry. After the examination which seemed very satisfactory as the sentry appeared &amp; was strong &amp; healthy, the Doctor asked for full particulars of whence he had come &amp; what he had been doing during the bitter winter,</p>
<p>The Doctor became very interested &amp; sat on the end of the bed listening to the details as to how the Advance had been carried out, but when the Sentry explained that he could not understand why it was so difficult for him to walk</p>
