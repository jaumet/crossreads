12/6/17 Paristhe doors (together with the justified expectation of palm oil by our vinous conductor). We went first into the Royal Chapel which has a magnificently painted ceiling in 3 parts. Ascending through a passage we stood on the balcony used by the royal family. To attempt to describe in detail what next we saw would be quite impossible as it is beyond description. Every inch of these wonderful rooms is either carved or painted. The wood work of the walls is chiselled into thousands of designs. Paintings by masters are in every room and on every ceilings. The old conductor spoke in terms of extreme unction as we went from one room to another. 'C'est la salle a manger d'la reine Marie Antoinette'. "C'est le cabinet de travail de l'Empresse Josephine, la premiere femme de Napoleon le premier". The Salle de la Guerre is a small room full of the glorification of war. The walls are carved into representations of golden armour and mighty warriors and the paintings showed victorious battles.
