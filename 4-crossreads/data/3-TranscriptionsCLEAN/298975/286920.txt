  
 order given out. Was that we would be in at 2 PM later it was changed to 4 PM. About 4.30 all troops were fallen in And I had to bring 3 sentries with fixed baynots to guard the companion way. We were still a good distance out, so were dismissed. Then later Assembly sounded & we fell in again more hunting up sentrys The troops were again dismissed & we anchored out in the harbour at dark. 
 Saturday 14th I was put in charge of The Guard & no other N.C.O. was put on. So have had to stay up all night
