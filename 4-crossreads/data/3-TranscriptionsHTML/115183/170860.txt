<p>(94)<br/>yourself notice and plenty of cocoa and biscuits, It was now about 6 pm. Then from Eecke we went on to Godewaersvelde a fair sized village behind Mt des Catts. Here we stayed for the night, sleeping in barns full of straw at a large farmhouse.</p>
<p>The next morning 28th Sept we moved off after a late breakfast arranged at the COs request and marched by a very roundabout route to Steenvoorde a large village having a very fine church indeed. From here after a halt we marched on to Winezeele where our billets were to be for a short time while resting.</p>
<p>Winezeele is only a small village and not of any note. We were quartered here in the barns as usual but I preferred the floor of a large farm wagon and some clean straw. We had arrived at dinner time and spent that afternoon and the next day, the 30th Sept at 9 am we were taken by motor lorries back through Steenvoorder through L'Abeele and then the town of Poperinge, with it's square pretty church and town hall to the large town of Ypres. Our section was taken through the town out towards the line along the road to Zonnebeke</p>
