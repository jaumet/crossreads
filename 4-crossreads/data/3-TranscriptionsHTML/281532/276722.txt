<p>3/10/18 Nauroy</p>
<p>A fine day. The 5th &amp; 7th Bdes attacked this morning on a front of 6000'. The prisoners came past fairly early and stray wounded ones also continued to drift past for some time. Took H. Smith and went forward to the ridge between Joncourt &amp; Estrees to have a look round. A splendid birdseye view from here. Down in a hollow the pretty little village of Niancourt was burning. In front was the village of Beaurevoir with our barrage on it and the troops just entering it. Between Beaurevoir &amp; Pont Choux was a road along which transport was getting away to the rear at the gallop &ndash; there seemed to be gun teams pulling out. Smoke and shell bursts spoilt a pretty landscape. Hun planes active and plenty of balloons up &ndash; one was burnt down by our planes. Artillery retaliation slight. At Noon ordered to move up &amp;</p>
