<p>again sent a few shells in the close vicinity of this camp.<br/>There was an inspection of all the mares in the Transports yesterday, with a view to picking out all suitable for breeding. Two were selected. This looks like as if the Government expected the war to end soon.<br/>Just as we were going to dinner the Transports got orders to move to a new camp near the Battalion &amp; not very far from our old camp at Hamel Hill. We hastly packed up and got everything away including the G.M. Store &amp; our tents up before dark. We had fine weather for the shift and only about 2&frac12; or 3 miles at the most to go. We passed through hilly country all the way along a winding road, we passed several new weather board Estaminets which the enterprising Belgains erected for the mutual benefit of the troops and themselves. The scenery was very picturesque farm houses &amp; camps all the way, interspersed with Estaminets, and at one place we passed within a few chains of the French frontier, a long pole finished <strike>about</strike> near the end &amp; weighted marking the barrier which was used in peacetimes to intercept traffic by the customs. Now it is pointing heavenwards &amp; all &amp; sundry may come &amp; go as they please.</p>
<p>Wednesday August 8, 1917. (1101.)<br/>This morning Bill Murdock &amp; I built or rather dug a latreen &amp; then built a cook house. We scoured the country for parts and wall plates. We did not get it finished to day.<br/>This morning we were paid. I received 30 francs, &pound; 1.2.0.<br/>Before dark it started to rain &amp; we dug a trench around our tarpolen tent.</p>
