<p>Bread strike begins so procession march along George St. I talk outside shop with sympathiser. I nearly buy a fight on tram Home.</p>
<p>Write to Ida Dunn.</p>
<p>16 September, Tuesday</p>
<p>Go to Welcome Home. Awful pianist, awful songs. "The Irish Washerwoman" nearly kills me &amp; brings me out in a sweat. I respond &amp; play Auld Lang Syne. Meet Tom Proud.</p>
