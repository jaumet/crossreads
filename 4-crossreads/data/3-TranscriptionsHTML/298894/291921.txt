<p>The day was interesting as we witnessed a fine bombardment.</p>
<p>Tuesday 18th.  About 4 A.M. we left the Dardanelles for Imbros &amp; anchored in a bay containing several Battleships &amp; transports  Here the SI. came alongside &amp; we discharged cargo into her.  Hay etc.</p>
<p>Wednesday 19th.  Was on fatigue duty in the morningay etc.</p>
<p>Wednesday 19th.<br/> Sending up hay &amp; oats from the hold.  We sailed for Cape [indecipherable] about 10 A.M. &amp; on our arrival began to take on wounded. There had been a strong attack by the Turks, quite the heaviest engagement since the first landing.  The Turks only managed to storm one trench but were bayoneted &amp; driven out again.  They suffered heavy loses, our fellows having the upper hand throughout.  It started about 1 A.M.   the Turks creeping up &amp; at dawn they made their effort.  I hear that the stench from  unburied dead is awful &amp; until our chaps advance it cannot be altered.  The arrangements for wounded on this ship are splendid a marked contrast to our last.  The Doctors with coats off, buckled to &amp; the cases were treated immediately &amp; refreshments were distributed to the men.  It was very gratifying to see as our last experience was awful, some of our last wounded are here again, it seems hard that immediately on their return they catch it again there is one consolation they will get proper treatment.  Our unit is not being utilized for the wounded the work being carried out by the Light Horse, 3rd, &amp; New Zealanders. There are so many A.M.C. men aboard that there is not work enough for all.</p>
<p>Thursday 20th,  Still taking on wounded &amp; familiar faces still</p>
