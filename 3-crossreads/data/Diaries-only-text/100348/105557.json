Went on a washing parade to the Etaples laundry. Had my clothes washed in soda and soap, wished I could have got into the mixture myself. Bill Brew has been taken to join the Pioneer Battalion he is the first to leave my clique. Still Raining, we are lucky that we are camped on sand dunes. There is no mud.

Drew Gas helmets from the Quarter Master. Went to the "Bull Ring" for instruction in their use. They are very uncomfortable to wear at first and take some getting used to. For the flannel fabric they are made of is soaked in a strong solution of Hypo and ammonia, and the fumes are very strong. But they are invalueable so no one minds the discomfort.
