<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>My address is Sgt D.B. Fry No 9 Officers Training School, Royal Military College, Duntroon, Federal Territory. So far we have been working awfully hard with reveille at 5.30 and lectures after tea. We go hard all day with only &frac34; of an hour for meals and always come straight off parade to meals, except tea, when we get off at 5 &amp; tea is 6.30. All the states are represented here and there are a fair number of returned men. The college is strictly out of bounds. Today, Sunday, we have been on fatigues all the morning but this afternoon some of us are going for a stroll up Mt Ainsley when a great view can be had.</p>
<p>The programme for next week is a snorter. The last Depot School was nothing to it. Love to all</p>
