<p>FEBRUARY 1917</p>
<p>26 MONDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; Sunny most of the&nbsp;day</p>
<p>&amp; nice &amp; warm. I was stableman</p>
<p>for the day. Capt Campbell</p>
<p>inspected again in the evening.</p>
<p>Serj. Major. Paton (or commonly</p>
<p>known as Satan) took</p>
<p>charge of the waggon&nbsp;lines</p>
<p>instead of Serj. Macintosh, much</p>
<p>to everybodys dissapointment.</p>
<p>We had to turn out &amp; get</p>
<p>ammunition at 8 pm but</p>
<p>were&nbsp;back at 10. A team</p>
<p>went up &amp; brought our</p>
<p>gun back to its position.</p>
