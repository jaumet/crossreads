  
 27/7/18 London which appears to be entirely devoted to the sale of fruit and flowers. It was long after the busy hours here and there was really not as much to see as at Les Halles in Paris. The opera (Carmen) commenced at 2 p.m. and the theatre was a good one and appeared to be exceptionally well equipped with exits. The last time I saw "Carmen" was at Rome and the English version today was far more enjoyable. Webster Millar was Don Jose, Doris Woodall Carmen, and Desiree Ellinger was Micaela. The conductor of a fine orchestra was a very young chap named Harrison. There was only a short pause between acts and most people did not leave their seats. One could not help being struck by girls
