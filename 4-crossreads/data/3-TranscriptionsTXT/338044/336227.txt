 Boulogne is a dirty place &amp; typical French fishing town, all cobbled streets   Legge &amp; I take a tram up the hill. Coming back to the hotel find Pal comfortable in bed. We have a long discussion over all our doing &amp; sleep well 
 4th August:- Friday Sleep in until 8 am &amp; thinking it later, do things in a hurry. Breakfast at the hotel &amp; a few of us go for a tram ride to the beach. Here are many Bathing-boxes   a good many girls are bathing, but the beach is not very good. Return to town &amp; pack up our traps, get to the station &amp;  secure kits. Our bill for the hotel  7 francs 50 centimes for room  &amp; breakfast each. A French soldier, who is on leave but now returning to Verdun is pleased to find me speaking French &amp; we have a regular great chat. At last we leave him &amp; a great deal of waiting around the station until about 2 pm. A canteen is here but of a very second rate. A cup of tea (or rather a basin) a few buns &amp; sandwiches suffices for lunch &amp; we take in a stock of ginger-beer
