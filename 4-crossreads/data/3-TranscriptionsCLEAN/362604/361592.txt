  
 duty trip to Lewes so as I have to go down to see Dave to-night & want to write to Auntie Annie & Bess I will ask you to remember me to Mesdames Keirle, Dobson Stephen, Bunting, Doyle, McConnell & to all their Families & also to the Parkes Family.  To my cousins & Aunts new & old, we both wish you to give them our greetings & well wishes. 
 Best Love Harry
