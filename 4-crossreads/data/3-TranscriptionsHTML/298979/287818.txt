<p>suggestion that a good chorus should be started. Away they would go! singing at their "top" but long before the second verse was through members of other sections would have "pricked their ears" &amp; started a song "on their own", so that before long the whole of the sixteen sections including even the (Babbling Brooks), cooks could be heard for hours.</p>
<p>Sentimental songs were given a "good hearing" this night &amp; the better known choruses were sung with great gusto.</p>
<p>The "comics" which did not seem to sound quite the same as formerly were only so half heartedly rendered that there would be quite a pause afterward. A very awkward pause that could only be broken by some two or three repeating a chorus again</p>
<p>But it was after such songs as "There's a long long trail", which is one of the Battalion marching tunes, &amp; the "Old Folks at Home", that caused a noticeable shake or quiver in more than one voice &amp; furtive glances were cast to see if any of the other men had noticed. After such songs it was more difficult to induce a man to start a new song, probably he was not sure of himself, but the rousing chorus of one of the other sections close handy would brighten them up at once and "all would be merry &amp; bright".</p>
<p>For at least a couple of hours the spirits of the men were on a constant rise &amp; fall &amp; often the fire in the brazier, or on the cement floor, would purposely be allowed to become dim till a startling demand for "more wood" would "shake" those nearby out of their almost undesired reveries.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken about the war not a word about the attack, not a word about the past, or the morrow.</p>
<p>Every man knew he was assembled there on his own invitation or volition simply to bid good bye to some of his comrades, who would "Go West" during the next Twenty four hours &amp; thoughts seemed to be passing through each mind, I wonder if its Tom's turn?, or Bill's? or, Whose is to go?</p>
