  
 picked up an arm by mistake (but noting these horrors it is all over now) I told you I drew a sketch of our position showing the Island of Imbros & the warships etc:- [indecipherable] some day you might with me to help you paint me a picture of it as  you did for Joe - I still have it in my mind & may attempt it this afternoon but I'm tired now -  All in my love little mother
