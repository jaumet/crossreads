Fatigue work getting wood.
Had a real good wash in fresh water, first decent one I have had since goodness knows when.
The Turks have rigged up some new guns & gave one of the guns of our mountain battery hell, about one hundred shells in all. Their shooting was excellent. They have also raked up a heavy gun from somewhere. It sent shrapnel down Monash Gully & got a couple of our chaps.
There is a constant growling from the guns of the fleet on the right & we are expecting big things to happen there shortly.
Went & had a yarn with Capt Fitzgerald. He is well. Found out that Harrison & Maxwell are both wounded. Also that Capt Fitzpatrick made a very poor showing.
Had bacon & two eggs for tea. It was First Class.
