The despatch riders horses was hit in the fetlock this morning by the snipers, they are getting a good few horses but the riders always seem to escape: The Turks opened up a very heavy fire at 4 oclock this afternoon right along the line, & directed all their Artillery on the trenches about a mile to our left, an attack was expected when the bombardment ceased, it lasted a good half hour & and our war-boats were very busy dropping big shells amongst the Turks. We received the oder to stand to arms some time after the bombardment commenced  but there was no charges made & everything was normal at sundown: Quarter Master Sergeant Easterbrook has been made Sergeant Major in Wrights place, Wright having received a commission.
