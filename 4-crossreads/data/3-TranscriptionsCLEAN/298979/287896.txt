 After recovering from the ear splitting detonation & the terrible vibration & scraping away the covering of mud, a glance showed a great hole made by the shell just three feet away. 
 Of course every man in that trench & the one close to it was startled & calls arose Any on hit?

After the first shock of the explosion was over each man was called but the second relief man who had been stretching himself did not answer. 
 He was then seen to be quietly lying right across his own position at the end of the little trench, with his head & shoulders on the parapet & his legs on the parados. He looked as if he was sleeping, peacefully sleeping, without a single mark of scratch.

 After the momentary calm of this discovery had passed attention was turned to the others. 
 The Sentry's partner's wounds were examined, & he was congratulated
