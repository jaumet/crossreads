<p>going to meet Dave.  Why He'll give you all the "good oil" about us &amp; you will not stop talking.  But still His own people will naturally want Him all to themselves for the first few days &amp; it would be better for you to go &amp; see Him some days later.  I have not had a letter from "Sal" Niness but I think she is bonnie from the way Dave speaks of Her.  So George is taking up Tennis &amp; Dancing.  They are two fine recreations, probably the two most enjoyable (next to Surfing) of all.  Oh, Mum, the English People are right enough morally.  They are frightfully dull in the Country &amp; are a d&mdash; worse than dogs on a Country road to a Cyclist.  But the City folk are just the same</p>
