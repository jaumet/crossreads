The period under report has been occupied taken up with what may be described as a general action. Some warning of the possibility of this was received from two sources. G.H.Q. passed on to us information received from the aerodrome that a large force of the enemy were about 228 land in with four steamboats and a number of small boats off the shore; HMS Triumph reported that there was a movement of troops from North and East of Krithia west along the coast.
This information was thought to be sufficient indicative of a possible attack in force to warrant sending a warning out to the troops to be on the alert. This warning reached the trenches at 10 p.m. and resulted in all troops being prepared for the heavy fire attack made at midnight, and for the actual series of attacks which commenced at  4 am shortly after 3 amThe troops under my command were disposed during the night as follows &ndash;  Main PositionNo.1 Section - 3rd Aust.
