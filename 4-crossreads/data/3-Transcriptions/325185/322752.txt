<p>now but are going back again to the Somme again shortly. If they could only take the Germen artillery away from them we would have them back to Berlin in a very short time. Man for man well we could walk clean over them. All the fellows that were at Galipoli say they would sooner six months there than two hours on the Albert front so that is a pretty big comparison isent it. Of coarse they hadent the artillery fire there. Has Olga Giles received any letter from me yet. Have written three letters to her from France. Also wrote her sister I think it was Moa Giles answered her letter I hope they receive my letters. Can't think of anything else to write about.  Father so shall close will write again shortly Love &amp; best wishes  from your sincere son  Clyde</p>
