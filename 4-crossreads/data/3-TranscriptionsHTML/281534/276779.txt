<p>8/1/19 Gourdinne<br/>Rode over to Nalinnes to Bde.H.Q. and there attended a Conference presided over by the General on certain questions of reorganization in the Army. Had an interesting yarn to James and others and then came back. Horse very fresh and bucking and prancing on the slippery roads. The sun came out and the afternoon was pleasant and mild. There was a great go at football between B &amp; C Coys. A good crowd there and the barracking was very keen. No sign yet of Pat Gorman returning and I told Bde H.Q. that I would not consent to his going off on any other jobs in future. The officers essayed a small dance this evening but only 1 M'selle turned up so they made couples among themselves &amp; waltzed to band music.</p>
