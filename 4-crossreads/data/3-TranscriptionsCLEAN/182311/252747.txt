On Transport "Runic"
24-6-16.
 
"Who hath desired the sea -
   The sight of salt water unbounded."
Was Kipling seasick when he wrote that?  For by the same token there were about a thousand lads on board a transport on the second night out who certainly did not desire the sea.
   Yes, and for a few hours I felt the same, I who had sailed a small "topply" canvas boat, and who had yachted in the bay, was seasick; however, it was short but very merry, or rather violent while it lasted, I ate without restriction and quite lost the good of two meals only.  Possibly I could have escaped had I been very careful but as is my habit I went down amongst the men on the troop/deck trying to make them comfortable and then it happened.  I know now one very good reason why our Les wanted me to wait until I had/my Commission for the difference in living conditions is very marked.
   I've one a good deal to make our men in "A" Coy comfortable, in fact the organization of the routine has practically been left to your humble son and I've put forth every effort to make them comfortable, spending my time below on the troop deck until I had a headache, even trying to get them their issue of beer.  Some of my chaps were pretty bad so I used to smuggle them down some oranges.
   The food for every rank is 100% better than in the Australian Camps and now that the boys have their sea
