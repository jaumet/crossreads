Turn Back
Wed. Mar 13
Got Letter from Ruth B. Wrote to France.
There is a Concert on tonight and all the money is going to a woman who married one of our fellows, and when he found she was about to give birth, he cleared out to France. It turns out now that the man is already married and got a wife and 3 children in Australia.
Sunday 19
Com. Letter No 13
Fine day, but showery. After Lunch went into Warminster with Roy Knowles. Had Tea at Town Hall. Went for a stroll beyond the Town. Very pretty country and quaint old House.
Attended Evening Service at "The Minster". Very fine church.

It was a very nice Service and I quite enjoyed it. The preacher "put over" a good Service on "The Marriage Service" which was most interesting.
Got back to Camp about 9 after a pleasant day.
