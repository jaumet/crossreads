<p>1915<br/>Mar. 1 Mon.<br/>Think I have got measles &ndash; very prevalent among the Troops &ndash; Face &amp; body marked with slight rash, tired feeling, face burning &amp; rather irritable.<br/>Attended meeting in Melbourne Y.M.C.A. at 7.30 p.m. when 6 of us connected with the Scout Movement in Australasia decided to form an Australasian Scouts Association in connection with the Australian &amp; New Zealand Imperial Forces.<br/>I have got measles alright but I am not going to report it or it is quite likely that I should be left behind if No. 2 G.H. makes an early start.</p>
