<p>MONDAY, JULY 28, 1919.</p>
<p>Rained nearly all day. I went</p>
<p>into town early. Saw Kemmis</p>
<p>re plans and he is calling for</p>
<p>ammended tenders with certain</p>
<p>things cut out. Clyde came home</p>
<p>&amp; I had lunch with Marj., Olga, &amp;</p>
<p>he at the Wentworth. Met Linda</p>
<p>and [Sleepy?] at Farmers for afternoon</p>
<p>tea, also Bobbie M<sup>c</sup>Millan.</p>
<p>We got home for dinner.</p>
