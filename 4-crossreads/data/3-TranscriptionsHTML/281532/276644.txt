<p>to us will fall the first blow of the stunt when it does take place Went to dinner with General Robertson at 6th Bde H.Q. in the evening when Cols. Brazenor and Duggan were also there and our cheery quack Doc Simmonds. Dinner was a merry meal although our old waiter Victor (of Savoy fame) was much missed. His death has here left a gap. The war seemed afar off as we dined but soon after, the crash of the antiaircraft batteries and a rattle of Lewis guns told of an air raid in progress. Walked back to our camp with Duggan. A splendid moonlight night with sweet scents of the summer in the air. In the moonlight faint fingers of searchlight beams were looking out for "Jerries" planes.</p>
