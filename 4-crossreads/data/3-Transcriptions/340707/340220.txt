<p>of the part where the houses were built before the level of street was taken &amp; still exist at night, the street is alive with rats. In fact almost any street in Paris has its rats by night owing to garbage systems.</p>
<p>Garbage here are placed out in street at night &amp; are then visited by cheffoniers miserable creatures half human who overall the garbage for [indecipherable] &amp; do not pick up the litter they have made. The garbage cart comes along some time before the morning. No wonder the plagues used to kill off Europe 600 yrs ago when sanitary conditions were not so good or rather less worse.</p>
<p>In Rue Monge coming home one night with a girl time 9 or just after dusk, an old dame rushed ahead into first doorway &ndash; it was closed &ndash; &amp; standing upright soon a sound of rushing water was heard &amp; the old dame laughs &amp; made some remark.
