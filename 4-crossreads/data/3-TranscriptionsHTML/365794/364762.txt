<p>Monday 24 December1917<br/>Busy for Xmas day &ndash; "Connaught" scheme is red shades, plants &amp; flowers, very effective though &amp; strangely enough, the pts. in their blue suits &amp; the white ward &amp; quilts carry out the "Red, White &amp; Blue" well.  Off duty 2-5, town &amp; shopped, without doing much, then duty &amp; shook hands with L. <strike>Allenby</strike> Wingate &amp; rec'd gracious word &amp; a card from them both.  C.G. very nice &amp; very scotch.<br/>I find only 12 men to cook for 1500 pts.<br/>C of E Padre is coldly friendly like the rest.<br/>Absence of home &amp; love &amp; weighing very heavily these days.</p>
