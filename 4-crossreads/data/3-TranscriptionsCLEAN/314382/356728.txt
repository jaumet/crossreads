  
 for Weymouth at 10 pm and we tumbled into our train, very very tired, with the prospects of a 4 hours journey before us. At 4 am next morning we arrived at Southampton & remained on the station & wharf, combined, until 6 am. 
 Tuesday 24th: - Although feeling extremely tired we went aboard a hospital yacht, the "St David" elaborately appointed for use by officers only and donated by an English Lord. 
 At 11 am with happy hearts our unit was marched to the rest camp lying 1 mile out and there began an encampment which I knew was to be extremely pleasant for the park surroundings were glorious. I thought that Southampton was as ideal a spot as one could wish for to spend a week or so in and I hoped that I should not be disappointed. 
 The night was quietly spent for all were too tired to do anything but sleep and we did until 9 am next morn. 
 August 25th: - A beautiful day. Parade held at 10 am & the glorious news announced that leave may be given us in a few days. The rest of the day was ours and advantage was taken to explore the Common on which the camp was pitched and the general verdict, was, that of all public reserves or parks we had seen, this was undoubt-
