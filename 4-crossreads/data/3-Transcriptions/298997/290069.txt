<p>we went in with bayonets fixed, and Happy George (Capt Steen, our Company Commander) riding ahead on his horse.  We were in artillery formation, of course; but the sun had not gone down, and Fritz must have got good observation of us.  It looked as if someone had gone mad; but the idea that prevails is that we were out to create a diversion for the French, on our right, by making Fritz think we were to attack, whereas the attack was to come from them.  It didn't, but it may have been anticipated.  We were somewhere up towards Strazeele.  Of course the Germans shelled us as we were going down a hill-side and made things unpleasant.  When the shell hit us, I had dropped out to fasten my equipment, which had worked loose, &amp; was just joining up again when the shell landed. There wasn't much feeling about it; I don't know whether I was knocked off my feet or not, but it seems that all that was left of the platoon were the four Lewis Gunners, who were the last "four", Phil Knight, (the second sergeant) &amp; myself &ndash; who should have been were the shell hit.  I have since heard that seven were killed &amp; eleven wounded and that Bob Humphries &amp; McKye were both killed.  Humphries always used to say that</p>
