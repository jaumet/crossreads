<p>No thrills</p>
<p>Sunday 20th<br/>Rained this afternoon cooled the air a bit. A boat has showed up on our near side flank otherwise the Port beam. It is our chief excitement. The usual cheerefull lot said it would pass us in a few hours but it has been about the same place all day. In fact the same boat was sayed to pass us 2 days ago.<br/>Padre lectured on The Microscope Band at night   Usual services</p>
