<p>Tuesday 31 July 1917</p>
<p>Had a funny experience last night. Two of our Secret Agents came thro' our lines. Dressed as Bedouins they showed the Officers where they carried their messages etc. &amp; also took off Turbans &amp; exhibited 5 or 6 Turkish sovereigns. After satisfying myself they were genuine I gave them a Pass sent them on to D.H.Q.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I was rung up on Telephone &amp; accused of taking a Turkish Sovereign from one of the Agents. This is an old Oriental Confidence trick that works with our Officials <u>sometimes</u>. This time they drew a blank.</p>
