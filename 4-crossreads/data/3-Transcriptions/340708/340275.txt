<p>August 1917<br/>Thursday 9th<br/>Finished up bombing early this morning &amp; then started shelling again got very close to the Hospital at times so we are going to shift the hospital in the meantime we are drafted to various C.C.S's.   Myself &amp; a lot of others went to Baillieul it is pretty close to the line &amp; we are surrounded by aerodromes so we are in a dangerous place.  The hospital is part of an internal [indecipherable] Lunatic Asylum.  There are 1400 Women in it of all nationalities so there is not much fear of him shelling us.<br/>Friday 10th<br/>Fritz commenced the day by by sending over a lot of stuff into the railway station &amp; bombed all round us this evening.   We have great entertainment watching these aeroplanes as there are thousands here</p>
