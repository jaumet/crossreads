<p>14/11/1915<br/>Weather dull. Sunday. Like more rain. 12.30 P.M. Shells coming over, High explosives, we were getting hell for half an hour. Never saw such luck, one shell fell about 2 yards from a string of horses, another went over our lines just missing our horses and burst in the road. About 12 or 15 shells over altogether, all percussion. Then they started some time shrapnel, and wonderful to relate, as far as our lines are concerned, no one hurt. The Asiatic guns are having a rap at us. The French 9.2 are answering them shot for shot. The 1st Battery had a couple of 4.7 in their horse</p>
