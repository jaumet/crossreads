<p>One of the men received a box of Christmas gifts and papers including an "Evening News" dated Nov 8th and "S M Herald" dated Decr. 1st. The former contains a picture of the gun "captured" (God bless us!) at Rabaul by the Australians. This is the gun mentioned in my diary on Sept 21st but as usual no mention of the Naval Reserve is made, though it was the men of my own Coy (No. 2) who "captured" it. The "Herald" is even worse. It states that "the occupation of Fredk Wilhelmshfn was carried out entirely by the Military". Then I couldn't have been there after all! I pinch myself &ndash; I am awake! I re-read my own diary &ndash; and I find an entry that the Naval Guard consisted of 31 men under Lieut Read. It is too deep for me, and if I think any more about it I'll "bust".<br/>6 pm, nearing Sarang : The "Gabriel" is not so bad after all for, though she certainly carries plenty of top-hamper, she behaves very well in a sea. During the past week or so North Westers have been blowing strongly (it is now the N.W. monsoon) knocking up a lumpy sea. The appearance of one or two of our passengers reminds me of the steward who came up to the pale looking individual in the Saloon saying gruffly, "You can't be sick here!" "Can't I!" said the other with miserable conviction.<br/>We expect to reach Sarang shortly where we will anchor or the night. Then heigho for Alexis where our letters from home await us.<br/>Closing Diary to catch mail.</p>
