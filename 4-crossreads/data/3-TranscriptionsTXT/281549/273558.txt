clean. There was a lot of nice scenery to be seen at a few minutes walk off the camp. The Kiama Blow hole was the main attraction, The Kiama Lighthouse which throws a green light to sea is situated on the headland on the North side of the Camp.
On the afternoon of the 19th I was granted Final-Leave till the night of the 24th September I spent my leave mostly at home. When I returned to Camp I was not granted anymore leave till the night of the 6th of October when I was allowed a few hours off.
On October the 6th I left Kiama Camp for Sydney. I had previously been allotted to the 21st Reinforcements of the 13th Battallion while at Kiama. Well I arrived in Sydney in due course & we were all quartered at the Show Grounds for the night, I was allowed a few hours leave to say Good-Bye to everyone at home.
At about 5 am the 21st Reinforcements left the Show ground & were marched through the city to Dalgetys Wharf at Millers Point where we embarked on the S.S.Ceramic belonging to the White Star Company.
