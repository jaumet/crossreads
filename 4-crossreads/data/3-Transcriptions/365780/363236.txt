<p>found to be the battleship Sydney. When we..were in the reef we were going between Islands and it look beautiful sights. We were escorted on to Palm Island by the Sydney before we reach Palm Island the Sydney left us and went for coal at Townsvilles. We were on our own till we got to Palm Island and we found the Encounter waiting for us. Well we drop our anchor and stop at Palm Island a week. The Sydney returned again in two days.<br/>   While we were there we had boatracing and we had great concerts a nightime to fill in the time. We were sent ashore for a little shooting and the boat could not reach the shore and then we had to get out and puddle in all our<br/>and kits. When we were on shore we receive 5 rounds of<br/>bullets which I made 15 marks. Then when we were returning to the Berrima we sighted a boat coming in towards us and it stop till it got mails from us. In 2 days we receive a few mails and the store boat from Townsville with stores</p>
