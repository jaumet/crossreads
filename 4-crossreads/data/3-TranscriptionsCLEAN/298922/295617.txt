 Capt. Brace came round to Berners Hotel & told us Laura was O.K. I went Waterloo & shifted Baggage to P. & O. & then entertained 3 of Dollys friends at the Australian Club, not my pleasure but theirs, am glad to see our men are doing so well in Palestine & feel I should be there. Here the Restaurants & Theatres are always crowded with a pleasure loving well-dressed crowd, even on air-raid nights.
