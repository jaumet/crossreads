<p>Tues. 6.  We are only occupying one Hut at the A.D.S. now &amp; today got orders to move, so I saw Capt Farquar, the Eng. Chief &amp; explained things to him.  He said there was room for us at Waterlot Farm where the Engineers are Camped, so we packed up our Gear &amp; moved into a Big Tin Hut which holds 20 men.  I am camped in a dugout next door with 6 of the Engineers.  They have a stove there &amp; it keeps the place nice &amp; warm.  After seeing the sapper party off at 9.30 I went to Bed.</p>
<p>Wed. 7.  Yesterday Serg. Morris came along to see if we wished to be relieved.  Of course everybody said "Yes", as it is no joke to go 14 days without a hot meal.  About 10 a.m. I went back to Bernafay to arrange for a cook to be sent out.  When I arrived Serg. Jeffreys informed me that the Col. had sent in for me to go back to Bellevue Farm &amp;  take part in a Concert.  Bert Hunt was told off to take my place in charge of the Fatigue Party.  I had Dinner with Billy May Roy Knowles &amp; party.  After Dinner I went out with Bert to explain the working parties etc.  Then I packed my gear &amp; went to Bernafay.  Boarded the Hospital Train about 8.  Arrived Becordel about 9.30 &amp; walked on to Bellvue Farm, about 2 miles.  Arrived there about 10.30.  Slept in the Cook's Tent with Jack Kitson.  The Concert had come off that night, so I was too late.</p>
<p>Thur. 8.  Slept soundly till about 9 a.m. when one of the Cooks brought my Break. to me in Bed.  Buttered Toast, Tea &amp; Bacon which was quite a Banquet after doing 14 days in the Trenches.</p>
