Good swim with Drummond and Major Smith Remarkable appearance the cliff presents running up from beach. A mass of dugouts terrace on terrace. Fires puffing about.
Quiet morning. A slack day in the interior economy of Regiment Feeling ill with influenza which is alright up till about noon but after that makes me very miserable. Turned in at 1400 and slept a feverish sleep until 1700 worried by flies and "nervy" sudden explosion of shells and big guns waking me up with a start frequently. Hope to be alright soon.
Soil here is a limestone formation my dugout is pretty well hacked up out of limestone. Being on slope it is always like a tomb, chilly and damp, and it catches every gale off the Gulf of Saros and Aegean Sea.
In evening went into question of C -- . Engineers will explode a mine at 1400 today. They can hear Abdul working a few feet away so hope to blow him to hell before he does the same to us. Later two men are to creep out climb up side of the C ? inspect interior and report what is there. Rather a ticklish job as the C ? is garrisoned and any head poking over the top is likely to be blown off at once without further parley. However they only have 4 yards to crawl as they will emerge from a secret underground tunnel Returning they will be exposed to rifle and machine gun fire at about 100 yards range but there are no lack of volunteers for the job. 
Rain came on during evening. Place sticky and filthy Sea roaring. Rain driving in on blankets while asleep. To bed 2130
