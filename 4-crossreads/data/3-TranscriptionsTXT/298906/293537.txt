a feather, not that I won't pay a decent or fancy price for a meal, but this was downright robbery, however we said nothing, paid up & walked out in disgust, feeling that we had been done in.After this another chap & I went down to the Municipal Baths, & had a good clean up & etc, & then a look round Southampton, in my opinion she is the finest laid out town I have seen so far she has bonzer wide streets, plenty of trees, fine big houses which stand well back in nice flower gardens, a good train system, & the cleanest town I have ever seen, such a contrast after Le Havre, Southampton is well worth a visit.
