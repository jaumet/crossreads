<p>FRI. Nov.  30.  Got an awful shock this morning when Georgie brought me a Bottle of Stout.  I ought to soon get well now, what with that &amp; the chicken.  Serg. Fowler got marked for Furlough today.  Stan Wright did not turn up.  I guess London is proving too attractive.  Com. Letter 45.</p>
<p>Sat. Dec. 1  There is a lot of talk about another Hosp. Ship returning shortly &amp; it is causing much excitement.  Capt. Fox our M.O. is flying round making out Board Papers.  He's got everybody guessing.  Finished Letter to Lill.</p>
<p>Sun. Dec. 2.  Capt. Fox made out Board Papers for nearly everyone in the ward.  He marked me B2b, but I am not holding out much hope.  Sgt. Fowler is going away tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mon. Dec. 3.  Fowler went away this morning &amp; Sailor went to London with him.  The Board came round &amp; examined us.  Capt. Fox pushed my Case a hard as he could, but I only managed to get B1b, which ought to mean a few months in Blighty, so I must consider myself Lucky as I never expected to get a Board at all.</p>
