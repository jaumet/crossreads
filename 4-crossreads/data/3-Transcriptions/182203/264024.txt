<p>message Sunday-morning, he rang-up &amp; invited me in for luncheon. That morning (Sunday.) one of the sisters from our hospital had asked me to drive into Alex. with her, so we had just left went Mr.C. rang-up. We did not return until 12.45 so I rang-up &amp;   told him. He said he could wait for me, so I just got the Gharry &amp; drove back to Alex but he had a mighty long wait.
