<p>lad in my ward just now with overstrain of heart &ndash; Cpl F. H. Jones of the 20th; from 42 Coltenham St, Glebe, his mother lives in Cobargo &ndash; he helped to carry poor Arthur in; a large shell &ndash; 5.9 he thinks &ndash; hit the dug out &amp; Arthur was killed instantly. He was buried next day in Bois Grenier burying ground: Lieut Evans of C Company took charge of his watch &amp; other effects.</p>
<p>Probably you have all particulars about him already, but if I see any patient from the 20th I shall ask to see if I can find out anything you might wish to know. Jones is very short of breath owing to irregular heart but is improving &amp; I hope in time</p>
