<p>I am enclosing a snap of Bert Brian from Burwood who is an old Pal o' mine.  We met in Havre &amp; celebrated the occasion by having the snap taken.  The other chap is a Croydon Boy named Honniball.</p>
<p>The Colonel won't let us come Home &amp; neither will the Demobilisation Staff so we are hooked for a few months longer now. But we will leave no stone unturned to get Home as soon as possible</p>
