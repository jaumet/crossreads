 My dearest Dad. A few lines to you. I asked Gibson about the money you sent &ndash; he had spent some of it on kit for the commission but some is still in the bank. He evidently has not had any alcohol since he left N.Z. and is very fit in that way. I'll write you anything I hear or see about him. So don't worry any more than you can help. The girls are delighted at his being here, and will be able to visit him
