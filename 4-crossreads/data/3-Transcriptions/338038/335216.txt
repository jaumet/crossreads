<p>40<br/>Tel-el-Kebir<br/>Egypt 6.3.1916<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>I was expecting to be able to give you my change of address by this time, but things are still very unsettled &amp; it is quite on the cards that I may have to go back to the 1st Division. The General commanding the Artillery of the 1st Division says he must have more of his original officers &amp; has ordered the return of 2 other subalterns &amp; myself while Colonel Rosenthal commanding this Divn refuses to let us go so the matter is in abeyance. I am still acting Adjutant of the 11th Brigade and if I remain will in all probability get my Captaincy, whereas if I am recalled it will be as a Subaltern. There is a conference</p>
