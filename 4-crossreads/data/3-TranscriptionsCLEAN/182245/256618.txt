 APRIL 1917 
 13 FRIDAY 
 Fine & fairly warm. Got word 
 in morning we were moving 
 out of the position at midday 
 & we had to have everything 
 packed ready. We moved 
 off at about 3 pm & went 
 round through Steenwerck 
 to some waggon lines 
 about a mile the other side 
 Our gun team stayed behind 
 & brought the gun on later 
 We are on our way down 
 to S t  Omer, for some open 
 fighting training I think. 
 I was on picket at night. 
 We left a very good home 
 when we left "Jesus Farm".
