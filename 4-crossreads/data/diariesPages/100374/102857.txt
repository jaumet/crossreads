Paraded at six oclock and moved off at seven to A. Camp near Alex. Rain fell during the evening.

We fared pretty well with regard to food in this camp. Nine men occupy each tent.

When one gets in amongst a crowd of men the same subject always crops up namely despicable talk as regards women. The conversation may commence on religion but it invariably finishes up with women.

Owing to the way in which some of the men are behaving when they get out on leave only twenty five per cent are being allowed out on leave at one time.

A little Indian soldier had made a fireplace in the open just outside one of our tents. He was baking a scone on it and out of curiosity a few of us had gathered round to watch him. It was very interesting to watch him knead the dough and then place the scone on the girdle. One of our number, we always find them in our midst, one of those who play jokes at other peoples expense, put his foot on the iron. This roused the Indian’s anger and he went and told the S.M. It appears that an Indian will not eat food touched by an unclean person, that is a person who is not of the same caste or religion as themselves, hence the anger of the Indian when the utensil which he was using was touched by an unclean person.

Went to the Soldiers & Sailors Institute in town. At this place
