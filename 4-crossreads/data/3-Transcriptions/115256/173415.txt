<p>Australia's Army</p>
<p>Oh! a soldier's life is free from care,<br/>He revels in cake and ginger beer;<br/>For the law makes us all teetotallers here,<br/>And a soldier mustn't get balmy.<br/>We're not very clean, I own;  but then<br/>A wash isn't very easy when<br/>There are only three taps to a thousand men.<br/>It's a way we've got in the Army.</p>
<p>We get as you know the princely pay<br/>Of five bright shillings for every day;<br/>And I for one, would willingly say<br/>Such a rich reward would charm me,<br/>Were it not for the fact, which is sad but true,<br/>That it's always a fornight overdue &ndash;<br/>I swear that I'm not deceiving you &ndash;<br/>It's a way we've got in the army.</p>
<p>As the A.I.F., of course, must eat,<br/>We get 'dixies' loaded with wholesome meat;<br/>But they seem to think that I'm so replete<br/>That any more food would harm me.<br/>For I always find &ndash; and I'm not alone &ndash;<br/>That all that is left is fat and bone;<br/>So I cuddle my empty plate and groan &ndash; <br/>It's a way we've got in the Army.</p>
