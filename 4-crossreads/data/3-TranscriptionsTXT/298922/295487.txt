Tomorrow the G.O.C. inspects us, much cleaning of accoutrements etc.;  moving Bivy I can see the Store ships landing stores by lighters this side of GAZA, the same as we did at ANZAC. I get 2 [indecipherable] a day & enjoying them. "Bombing" Classes are now popular as the sea coast swarms with fish & one bomb well thrown into a shoal returns many. Did you get a MILLS BOMB I sent by Pearse of the Comforts Fund. I told him to leave it at McKinson & Lavenders office, Sydney - nil load. Had dinner with the Gunners a SOMERSET BATTERY.
