<p>April, 1917. 2nd after Easter. Sunday 22<br/>Day fine with some wind. Up at 9.30 and after cleaning spent day in writing, washing &amp; various duties. 15th F.A.[indecipherable] moved in and I saw Paternoster from Gawler. 15 Brigade also in Mametz camp. Rumours of Australians going out for 6 weeks spell and then to Armentieres. Also war will be over before we again go into trenches.</p>
