<p>8.5.15<br/>Sat. 8th.  I had a bad throat last night &amp; bought a gargle from Fletcher &amp; my throat is still very bad this morning.  Arthur Welch came over soon after dinner then went to Town &amp; returned about sunset &amp; took some letters &amp; photos to post for me as I believe that our letters are being censored when posted in Camp.  Fell in to answer the roll call at 8 oclock &amp; every man was issued with 150 rounds of ammunition per man.  We were also issued with knapsacks during the afternoon.  <strike>&amp; the signallers with leg</strike>.</p>
