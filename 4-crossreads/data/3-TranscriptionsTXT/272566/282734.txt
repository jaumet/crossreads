 Thursday 20 December 
 Snowy and frozen ground. Sun shining all day &ndash; Beautiful weather but rather cold. I took a day off and this afternoon two of us went for a long walk through Cremarest and Bellebrune to La Capelle.  At this place we had a fine meal.  Only French Forestry troops live here &amp; civilians, of course. Returned through the Boulogne Forest to Wirwignes and hopped straight into bed.
