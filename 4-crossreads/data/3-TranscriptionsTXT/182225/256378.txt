1916   SATURDAY 16   SEPT.
Fine. Out with the range takers ect in morning & got away at 12 pm with Warren in a car. But the thing broke down half way to Salisbury & we had to get another car. Got up to London about 4 pm and picked up Alan & Ike Moses & John Wilkinson & a lot more. Went to see "Romance" at the Lyric but it was a real good thing spoilt. We had supper somewhere afterwards & got to bed.
