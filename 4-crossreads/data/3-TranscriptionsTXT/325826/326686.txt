 Box Hill. Melbourne Friday 16.7.15 R &amp; A 19.7.15 P.S. I meant to say that the boat left at 20 to 4, not such a long wait as I had feared.  Initials.  Yes, thank you Father the manuscript arrived safely yesterday.  Initials. My dear Father &amp; Mother, I was very glad to get the home news when I came in this afternoon from seeing the "Demosthenes" off.  Father's letter was here waiting for me.  I hope Le will get on well &amp; all the colds &amp; "unwellness" in the house disappear, and that very soon. Rid went on board a little before 12 just before the troops went on- about 2000 there were, they said.  We were all kept behind barriers at the entrance to the Pier, about 5 minutes walk from where the boat lay- a big crowd of people there were &amp; it was only just when the ropes were thrown off &amp; the boat was about to leave that the barricades were unlatched &amp; there was a mad scramble along the wharf to try to reach the boat before she got quite away, to wave the final good-byes.  Doris &amp; I ran our hardest &amp; just succeeded in getting a good look at Rid &amp; a shouted message from him &amp; the boat had gone!  But I had a lot of waves from him after, as she passed quickly out, for we had arranged a special sort of wave.  Everybody has been very kind indeed here &amp; I will try &amp; be content to stay a little while, though I feel terribly restless &amp; want to get home.  Still I am going to try &amp; remember that "A lowly heart that leans on Thee is happy anywhere." Forgive brevity, but I find it hard to write at length. Much love Ollie.
