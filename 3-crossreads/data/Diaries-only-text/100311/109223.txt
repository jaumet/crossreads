For their attack the 4th. 5th. Divns. struck dreadful conditions as heavy rain squalls started during the night towards morning there was a bog in all directions. At 6 a.m. we had reveille and it was the devil packing up gear etc. in such a crowded place. At 8.15 moved off to the station and found some delay with the trains but managed to get away eventually about 10 o'c. About Reninghelst a pleasing change comes over the country but the touch of winter is on everything and today is cold and raw. The hopfields are now bare. The monastery of Mont des Cats stands high on its peak and is the home of the Trappist monks. Marched by muddy roads to our old billets outside Steenvorde. A pleasant girl who speaks English served us with coffee and bread butter. Groves and others reached us from B.
