<p>look at a man &ndash; a patient with a small intractable ulcer  -</p>
<p>I saw him over the side &amp; wished him no end of luck in chasing up the Scharnhorst &amp; Gneisenau &amp; wished moreover I could see the scrap from start to finish  -  I'd love to see that forward turret unmasked &amp; her 12 inch gun talking thro her long mouth piece  -</p>
<p>I wrote a note to the wife at Glen Innes but she musnt yet hear about our ships &amp; their position &amp; the loss of AE1 &ndash; at least not from the front &ndash; a good colorless letter with lots of health in it is the correct one in war time  -  Naval officer's letters are not censored hence one must be doubly careful  -<br/>I'll note one thing more &ndash; to  - day &amp; that is that our concert here is to break up  -  Evy  -  ship has an appointed job of work  -  Starts tomorrow  -  Frederick Wilhelms Haven on the coast of New Guinea is to be collared - the German war ships to be followed</p>
