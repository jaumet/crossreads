Tuesday
Rain thick mist. Scratch for breakfast. Fall in for moving off at 9.30. Stand about for 1 hr. Move off slip slide down hill up another, falls guffaws. Main road. Block off traffic. 5 yards stop. most tiring, slush creamy mud. Immense convoys the "pomp circumstance" of war. Mud bespattered horses men. This is the side that has no charm. Took till 4 p.m to make 2 miles. Pass thro? Fricourt, Montbaum Mametz. Camp in Mametz wood.. search for dugouts. Such confusion of holes amp fallen trees. Manage to get into a warren make ourselves as comfortable as damp smelly hole would afford. Back to pre-historic times. living in the ground. Beaucoup bombard all night.
