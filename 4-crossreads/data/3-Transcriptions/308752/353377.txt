<p>&amp; enjoyed a good hot meal. All the bearers about 104 all told, were completely done du, this almost past human endurance, &amp; I am surprised at myself sticking it out. My feet have been wet almost the time were in the trenches.  It simply poured in torrents on our way out of the trenches, all wet through. Good news to hand, that we ill rest here for the night. Came across Les. Hall from Cremorne, Tiny O'Brien &amp; Ern. Snashall. They were very kind to me, gave me some dry underclothes, &amp; a good tea. I appreciated their kindness extremely.</p>
<p>8th November.   We are to remain here at least a fortnight, this is very unfortunate at the mud about here is almost as bad as that we experienced in the trenches, &amp; we are still in range of the German guns.  9th November.  12 months to day since I left dear old Sydney, I often think of good old "Braemar" &amp; the great kindness you both gave to me. It is only when a fellow is away from home like this that he realises what his parents are to him   God Bless you both.   A great number of men who were on board the "Beltana" are now alas missing, it is cruel to think that we ill never see them again. Good old Captain Ward is in this hospital, so I visited him on the anniversary of our departure from Australia. He is one of the most popular Chaplains we have, he has had rather a miserable time for the last fortnight, conducting burial services. A great surprise sprung on us to day, we are given some work to do making roads. This is a bit too hot, we deserve a rest, but of course it is a way they have in the Army. L.W.C.  10th November still working no rest for the weary.  In the evening I jumped on a Red Cross Car &amp; travelled</p>
