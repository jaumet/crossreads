  
 I'll wind up with a little true yarn - Bumpus & I were on the quarter deck - 3 men came up & saluted - What's up said B - "Its about a box - Sir - Who is the owner? - Sir" - Right-Oh said I - I'm a T.P. I'll hear it - A had a box - B says he'll give 5/ for it - Right says A & hands over box - B hasn't 5/ just at the moment but says he'll pay - B has box - In mean time C meets A & says he'll give A 10/ for box - A wanted B to return the box on the grounds (1) that he wasn't paid - (2) that he'd get 10/- for it in place of 5/- - Whose box is it Sir - please??  Judgment  - C washes out - Transaction is between A & B - B owes A 5/- Carry on - Arent they funny, just like children? - Quite satisfied - they went forward - A ship like this is a big doll's house - you get to know each dolly intimately & each dolly gets to know every other dolly - go easy & they are the simplest crowd to me - the most sociable & most loyal to their mates - Officers & Ship
