<p>Chief of the General Staff,<br />Melbourne:</p>
<p>My reasons for deporting G.F. Teufert from Rabaul were fully set out in my despatch to the Minister, dated 21st October last, an extract from which I now attach.</p>
<p>I also enclose herewith a translation of a letter dated 4th October from Teufert to the Officer Commanding the German Warship &quot;Cormoran&quot;, in which, among othe things, he states his willingness to place his vessel, the &quot;Siar&quot;, at the dispisal of the German Navy if required. &nbsp;This letter has only just come to my hands, having been obtained by my Officers at Eitape. &nbsp;I sent a copy to Colonel Pethebridge on 27th ultimo (see copy of letter to him also attached hereto).</p>
<p>Under all the circumstances I consider Teufert a dangerous man; he is a dominating factor and exercises great influence over others in German New Guinea to our disadvantage. He would, in my opinion, be a disturbing element to the&nbsp;British Administration, and is not a man who would respect any oath of neutrality.</p>
<p>I,&nbsp;therefore, strongly advise that he is not released, but remain interned in Australia to the to the end of the War.</p>
<p>Colonel</p>
