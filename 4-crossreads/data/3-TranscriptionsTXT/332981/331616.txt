van as all hands was so comfortable having plenty of room.
After changing our beds and kits and making ourselves comfortable, we all had a good rest, and was not required until 8 am this morning Saturday Feb 15th.
Our next destination was Caudas via Arras with a long train loaded with German Gotha Aeroplanes, under an armed guard. We left Somain at 8.30 and arrived at Arras at 11.30 am where we all had dinner in the van, and now at 1 pm we are waiting for our Pilot before we depart. As I take over at 6 pm I intend having a sleep during the afternoon.
At 1.30 pm we left Arras and made a good run to St Pol and after waiting for a Pilot which was supplied which was supplied at St Pol instead of Arras. We left St Pol at 5.30 and did not stop until Doullens was reached at 6.45 where I took over and after a few minutes run arrived at our destination Caudas where we left the train in the siding and was piloted into the R.O.D.
