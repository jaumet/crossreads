  
 can sweep the gullies. The "Tommies" seem to leave their dead lying anywhere near line & we had to start burying their leavings as soon as we got here - Consequently so many "Unknown British Soldier" graves about the country. 
 Sat. Nov. 4th: - Relieved by "B Coy" early this morning. Bitterly cold & wet in line & 24 hours at a time is quite sufficient for a polar bear. No casualties & went back to support trenches near Flers. A few Reinforcements waiting there to join us up - One of them, I think, his name was Thompson out of the Cyclist Corps, was buried with three of us by the explosion of a large shell & had his neck broken - Hark luck just joining us up &   getting his "final" before getting in line. At daytimes the weather seems to clear up but at night the rain starts & make things horrible. We are on fatigues straight away & have been up to line tonight in rain & mud with rations. 
 Mon. Nov. 6th: - As I was writing here a premature burst from one of our own guns caught us here in trench & gave us the "noises in the head". Killed a chap named Bramby in the trench behind. Left support trenches here at night & went back to road behind Delville Wood. More "Mud-pies".
