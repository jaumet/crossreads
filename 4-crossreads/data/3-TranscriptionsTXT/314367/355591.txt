Next we had read to us the articles of war - Death or whatever penalty the King thinks fit for sneezing in the presence of the enemy or for not conducting ourselves on any & every occasion in the strictest possible manner - There was one clause which met with my approval & that was we weren't to rob or molest the captured or civilians or women & children in any way whatsoever - They were to be treated decently - When that was over we were dismissed - I have sick parade at 8.30 & report to the commander at 9 - Gun drill followed & the placing of hoses & what they call coolutions & a lot of things that I haven't the grip of yet - I put all the Spectators in the Smoke room - They are very good & give a succinct account of the war & have very sane articles - They recognize fully that we maynt win though probably we shall - They urge every man, young or old, to drill - Any man 19-35 who wont volunteer should be ostracised & made to feel his duty - The Spectator is all right I can tell you - It should be widely read - By the way the Captain also told us we were going to Rabaul - Holmes! then to give us Petheridge probably.
