<p>5 January 1918 Saturday<br/>Found letters from Dolly &amp; Laura &amp; my Horses well- MUD &amp; water everywhere [indecipherable] Jim Ayre is well.  Digby Willan came up on the train to one of the other Regts.  I think the Regiment is glad to have me back but I am now C.O. of A Squadron but address letters as of old just to the Regiment.<br/>As you will see by the Map- Esdoud is due East of Jerusalem.  Raining hard.</p>
