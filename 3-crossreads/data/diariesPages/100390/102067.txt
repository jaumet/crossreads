My Dear People
At last I have a chance to write again. We have been very busy indeed preparing for some approaching event which I cannot tell you of for Censorship reasons. I am at present on water guard which is to keep the troughs full for the horses and to prevent the septic Arab from washing in the water. 
The little sketch above is the view from where I sit. Far off the blue grey in the morning air are the minarets of the celebrated Mosque of Mohamed Ali the Citadel both of which dominate Cairo which is below to the left. The row of trees masks the road from here to the city a beautiful avenue of shady trees sheltering a fine limestone road 10 miles to the town. In the middle distance lies the beautiful verdant land of Egypt, its crops of Berseme, a kind of clover used for fodder. 
To the left is a camp village of Arab dirty mud huts. Before me thro the desert sand move the women of the village with their stately walk carring wonderful loads balanced on their heads their 
 in delightful folds flapping in the soft breeze. Tiny donkeys loaded with produce the snaky deliberate camels move to fro. 
At my rear towards the morning sun and about  mile distant tower the great pyramids close behind me again is a beautiful grove of our own gums. Sheltering the newly formed hospital army medical camp where nurses in grey white grey red move thro the grove attending the 400 sick who lie here. These girls have just arrived bring with them quite a breath of home. We are not permitted to speak to them unless we hold at least a Lieutenancy. It must be very interesting to them here as this town of their the only white women for miles among so many soldiers. 
Away again to my left the desert in golden grey with strings strings of tiny ants - cavalry black against the sand. The palest Khake looking against this brilliant background.
