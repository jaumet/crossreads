 My dear Mother 
 Another letter mail in last night with one each from you and Father and a letterette from Fred. Your letters were dated 19th & 20th April and you had just received my photos of Jerusalem. I would like to have sent you something really nice from there but there was not much to choose from and everything was three times its proper value so I thought the photobook would be the best. I am sorry to hear of the dry autum you are having at home also about the wethers only bringing 22/2. I suppose that is poor for the way sheep have been selling but it does not seem to bad a price to me somehow. I received a card from Hal dated 25th April which he says that Mudgee had just had 70 pts of rain so I hope you got enough to be able to carry on with the sowing & plowing. I will be very pleased if Father uses my money again but what I cant see is why he cant continue to grow using it instead of paying it back into
