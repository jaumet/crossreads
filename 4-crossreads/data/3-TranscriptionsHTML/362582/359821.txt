<p>Sisters and a few of our men Staff. It was lovely on the water and we had quite a jolly picnic. Had morning tea on board &amp; returned about mid-day &ndash; Had a good rest until 5.30 p.m. then went for a swim. Then my devoted friend &amp; his pal took another sister &amp; me to Dinner at the French Club. It was a lovely moonlight night &amp; in this place we all mostly live out door after sundown. We got back just a little before 10 p.m. so had a ripping day. most of us sleep out &ndash; we have a balcony all around &amp; it is just an ideal spot for that purpose. I have been doing so for some time now. I'm as brown as a berry. The bathing is lovely &amp; try to go every day. On Wednesday-night a party of us went after dinner &amp;  it was great. Thursday on duty until 2 p.m., then rested until 6 p.m. went for a swim, returned about 7.00 p.m. had dinner &amp; then went to dressmaker.</p>
