<p>8/5/17     Favreuil  H20 C<br/> About midnight we reached H20C where the cookers were on the job. The camp here was to be vacated at 5 am and meantime our people were to bivouac in the open. There was a meal of hot tea and mutton stew for them. Unfortunately fairly heavy rain started which will make things uncomfortable as the poor devils are tired out. Turned in under a tarpaulin after much ingenuity had been expended on devising shelter but was roused nearly at once by orders arriving to move over to Favreuil as we go early to Le Sars. Started to walk across but met orderly with horse. The men being quartered hereabouts in the old "bivvies". Having a batman spoils one as a fellow feels quite helpless if such jobs as rolling a valise have to be done. Rain is continuing heavy. Slept all night in a tent near Q.M. store most of the men were in shelters and little dugouts but some spent the night in the rain. The language of the troops just now</p>
