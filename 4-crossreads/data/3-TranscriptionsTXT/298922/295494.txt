 Our planes bombed some came down over Bedouin country among them the BUS I had a ride in.  The Bedouins burnt them before they could be reclaimed but   The Aviators rode home on the tails of the other planes. 
 Just got news we move on Friday. This has been Paradise &amp; marks another milestone along the weary trail of war. Each move one &amp; all look for the end. The sea has done us all much good &amp; we have been CLEAN.
