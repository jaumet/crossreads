a visit to a place which was once used as a Slave Market.  There is also a place at the end where they used to kill all the Girls who were not pretty & consequently were never bought.This place is now turned into a fashionable piazza with a stage erected at one end of it.  Its chief purpose is to lure men into it & once in you meet all manner of prosti the higher class prostitutes, mainly French Italian & Spaniards, who all try to lead you away to their various haunts.  It was only to satisfy curiosity that I went in & it goes to prove again what a beast of a place this is.  To say that the whole proceedings are disgusting would be to put it mildly & I didn't stay there many minutes.I have now thoroughly re-equipped myself in clothing etc. & will throw my previous issue away on leaving here.Our French Interpreter arrived in Camp to-day.
