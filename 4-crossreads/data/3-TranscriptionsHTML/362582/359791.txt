<p>as escorts &ndash; We had quite an exciting afternoon, met Fred's Regiment moving out. So you can imagine my joy at seeing the boys again &amp; knowing they were alright. George looked very brown but well &amp; they were all so dirty. Fred was also surprised to see me &ndash; I met ever so many more friends along the line and poor old chaps, all looked so tired &amp; dirty &ndash; they had been a good number of days on the march. We could not get to the Canal, but stayed &amp; talked to all the boys. I received a little letter from poor old Norman but of course he could not tell me where they are, but old address would find him. He was well &amp; enjoyed the cigarettes I sent him. Tell Alice Bower I wrote to her last week. Hope you get all my letters. I'm awfully disappointed at not receiving my Aust. mail to-day &ndash; none since last Thursday &ndash; week, so am longing for them.</p>
