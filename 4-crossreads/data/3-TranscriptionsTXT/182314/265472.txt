 Dear [Slane?] 
 Before sending the enclosed letter to the General I would like to know if you concur, with reference to the statement that &quot;you are desirous of forming a Battalion band.&quot; 
 I should also like to make certain of the statement that some of your men were returned- Chalmers told me this when you were at Senlis. 
 Yrs 
 J. Travers.

 Dear Travers, 
 Yes., 3 or 4 men were returned to us &amp; I think the chief reason was that their particular instruments were becoming too numerous &amp; thus upsetting the &quot;balance&quot;. I think some men were imported by transfer from another brigade. I am forming a drum and fife band, the instruments are now on their way from England&nbsp; Yr Slane
