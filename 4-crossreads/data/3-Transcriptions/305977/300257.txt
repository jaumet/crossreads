<p>August 1915<br/>He is in B Squadron attached to the 7th.  I had a long yarn with him.  Its OK getting in touch with some of your old cobbers again.</p>
<p>Monday 30th<br/>Was on observation in the morning.  At 1.30 pm our Squadron took over the firing line from 'A' Squadron &amp; we took 2 troops of the 12th LH with us.  I managed to get a good dug out &amp; didn't go on duty at night.  We blew in a Turkish tunnel about 8.30 pm.  Some Turks were working in it at the time.  They kept up a fairly solid rife fire for some time afterwards.  Ernie Pauls came over again.</p>
<p>Tuesday 31st<br/>Had another good rest all day.  Received a letter from mother also some papers &amp; a tin of ointment which will help to combat the chats.  Answered mother's letter.  There was a lot of shell fire to day.  The Turks  must have had a lot to spare.  Went on tunnel guard</p>
