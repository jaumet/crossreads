 I am going on leave tomorrow. At 2.30 today drew &pound;8 and in addition was paid &pound;2.16.0 ration money for 14 days leave. No free railway passes are issued now, but ration money is paid instead, which for those who have only a short journey to go is much better but in my case it will probably take it all for fares. I paid to the Furlough Sargeant 14/- for fare to Belfast. There I will get a return ticket to Kesh or Pettigo. Also  a single ticket to Glasgow &amp; from there a single ticket to Weymouth, Unless I alter my programme on the way.
