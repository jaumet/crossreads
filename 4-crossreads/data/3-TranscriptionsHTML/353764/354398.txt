<p>Today I heard that promotion was near for me, in as much that I am to be appointed a Warrant Officer in a short time.  After this I don't think I will have to wait long before I gain my Commission.  I will Cable when this takes effect.<br/>Still no mail.<br/>I also heard that we are to be The Head Qrts Coy 3rd Div.  So I suppose it will alter address considerably.<br/>There is nothing much doing here to-day, so will wind up.</p>
<p>7.2.16<br/>Very quiet &amp; ordinary day with nothing of any importance happening.  W.O. in trouble with Major.  But everything eventually patched up.  Have felt sick all day but am very much better to-night.  Days work consisted of Rifle Drill &amp; route march in the evening.<br/> Held Concert to-night &amp; there were some very good items rendered.<br/> Special lookout being kept for Niggers.  Had a few kit bags stolen, so poor beggars have lost all their belongings</p>
<p>8.2.16  Tuesday<br/>Had a very busy day</p>
