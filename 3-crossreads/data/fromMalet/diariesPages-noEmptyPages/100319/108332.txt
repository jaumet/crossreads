28/8/18 Herbecourt
advance again tonight and to work around Herbecourt. No more sleep! Hurriedly issued orders and made arrangements and at 11 pm. left for a forward HQ. at Black Wood. When we arrived there, after a rough passage in the dark, we found plenty of dugout accommodation in the trench. Held a conference then of Davis Chalmers and arranged for them to go ahead at 2 am. The 23rd did the same at 1 am (though stated so in their order it was later perhaps). Issued orders for Greene also to move up here leaving down below at 1.45 am. The ground here is that of the old battlefield pocked and scarred with shell fire and now grown over with rank grass and thistles. Everyone very tired and exhausted with this business of constant moving.
