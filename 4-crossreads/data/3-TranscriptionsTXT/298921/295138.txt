 June, 1915 Wednesday 16 From all I can gather from the wounded I do  not  think the Turks are mutilating our wounded except odd cases &ndash; I, among all the wounded in Cairo have not found one case so far. I have posted you some papers at different times &amp; hope you receive them. What lot did Harry Phillips come with &amp; Fred Knight, they no doubt are now camped opposite, but with so many troops one cannot find individuals &ndash; only an ant out here; &amp; of small consequence.
