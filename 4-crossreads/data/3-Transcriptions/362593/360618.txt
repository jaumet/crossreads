<p>Sunday 22 November 1918<br/>Monday 23 November 1918<br/>Now I am certain of getting Home again which I never really expected to do.  I have started to take more care of myself &amp; also money.  We are all practically tea-total which avows our good sense.<br/>I put in time playing tennis &amp; golf mostly.  We are having a really quiete restful time after a long spell of active service.<br/>Flying here is no strain on one at all, it is only a pleasure.<br/>We are flying Avios.</p>
