<p>Sun 7th<br/>Church parade this morning in the YMCA &amp; had an exceptionally good service;  I was thinking of going to Mena after dinner with Stan, but decided to stay here &amp; write instead &amp; got quite a surprise when Arthur Welch &amp; young Hoddenot turned up at 2.30 PM</p>
<p>After stables we went into Cairo &amp; had a good time together.  I arrived back in camp at 9.30 &amp; scribbled a letter to Jessie before turning in for the night  I heard from Arthur that Morgan had been sent to the canal escorting the men, who were discarded back to Australia</p>
