Shrapnel is bursting all around the hills & the big shells from the ships are tearing up the ground at the same time, whilst the noise is just terrific.  A Turkish village behind the hills is also burning & huge clouds of smoke are rising high in the air.

There are two rows of our Trenches visible, whilst horses are tethered just behind them in a cleft in the hill.  Could also see other soldiers, taking tea up to those in the trenches, up along a small road they have made from the base.

10 p.m.  Can now hear the rifles going for all they are worth & it sounds like a million
