Tuesday, 1st November, 1914Cup Day in Melb, [actually 4 November 1914] terrific gale where we are, all boats faring badly.  Majority of men are sea-sick.  I went down below & worked mine off.
On Picquet again discovered horse with colic - became worse but improved with attention.
Whilst asleep this afternoon our W.A. contingent joined us two troopers & an escort at present I do not know the names of the cruisers.
P.T.O. for Sunday
Wednesday, November 1914In the Indian Ocean at last, we have yet to pick up the W.A. contingent.
Sea became rough & in consequence we did not have to exercise horses first aid & physical culture was the order of the day.
Many became sea-sick I was squeamish but not sick.
Our boat does not seem to pitch & roll like the others especially the Pera & the Armadale but she is bad enough.
