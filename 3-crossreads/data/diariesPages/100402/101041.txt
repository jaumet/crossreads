Friday 15 March
A wounded case this morning. Fritz attempted a raid on our left this morning we heard his barrage. No idea as to results. Glorious day. Fritz shelled our vicinity heavily for the greater part of the day but fruitlessly. Glorious day Ypres stands out very distinctly. The German bombardment last night signified also a raid by Tommies on our left at 9.30 p.m. but no idea as to results.

A beautiful Spring day. Fritz shelled about our dugout this morning to-night he is continuing it with heavy stuff fifty yards away are the distance. No carries.
