  
 You would think it impossible for him to escape. Shells bursting all around A fine sight, just dark enough to show up the bursts. He got through. Rather a good scheme worked off by the Artillery yesterday. One Battery firing on the first line trenches. The enemy left them, as they did so, another Bty opened fire on them, and drove them into the supports, another Bty followed them into the communication trench, and still another Bty followed them into open country. Terrible slaughter.  The General did not arrive, waited all day. A fair amount of gun fire on our left this morning. Fine but cloudy 29-5-1916 Aeroplanes very busy today. Weather fine Artillery quiet. Ammunition to Bty 39 rounds. Something doing on our left. Machine guns working rapidly. Time 8-30 P.M. Horses just in from exercise 9 P.M. 30-5-1916 More rain. Heavy Artillery fire on our left. Enemy sighted rethatching a building. 27 rounds
