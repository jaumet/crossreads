I won't attempt to discuss the opinions of the men & their ideas of rights & wrongs. Only I leave it to the reader to judge for himself. Anyhow by 7 pm everyone was on board & some time during the night the Afric steamed away again.
25/1/16Mess orderly again with Hooper & more trouble over washing up. Knife polish off so have to use a brick. Sugar now procurable at 6d a lb & tinned fruit gone up to 1/4 a tin, tinned salmon up to 1/- a tin. Sardines up to 6d a tin something cruel as there are only 9 sardines to a tin. Scotty afraid of submarines & torpedoes. He spends most of his time waiting for death. I believe & eagerly discusses the possibility of trouble & the cause of anything strange. Our course now due N.W. making us dubious as to our destination - a persistent rumour going round that we are heading for Persian Gulf & thence by shallow draught steamers to Messopotamia, This rumour began in Colombo & seems possible although hardly probable.
