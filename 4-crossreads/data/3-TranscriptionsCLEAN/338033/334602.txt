The new guards came along, with the Horse guards leading followed by the band and infantry. All were in their regimentals, wearing busby's and a fine sight one could not wish to see. The horse guards rode on to the war office in Whitehall where they change, while the infantry changed here. Both new and old guards do a great many drill movements, 
 Before finally handing over, the band playing all the while.
