<p>11 Sept, 1916<br/>Ber El Abe<br/>Its really Tuesday morning  Time 3.0 am.  Im on picquet &ndash; the Gee Gees are quiet &amp; the old Moon is streaming bright &amp; high, the old desert looks still &amp; sleepy with the moon light glimmering on the sand but the crickets are chirruping away merrily enough<br/>We left yesterday morning.  I thought I would never get in the saddle it was packed so high &amp; some dopey fool had hogged the mane of my horse; indeed I heard the boys betting "He will" "He wont" often, as my fate seemed to hang in the balance, twixt the ground &amp; the back of the horse.  The first have a camp in a Hod, it looks comfortable &ndash; The dates are ripe now.  We were very charmed at the sight of the sight of our camp, not a tree for half a mile &ndash; Nearest water half a mile, that's Booker.  However the section have a bosker little bag home right near the horse lines.  I am sitting at the door now &amp; can see the horses at a glance.  Johno is Snoring sweetly.  Ive been stuck into No 3 section with Johno, Godber &amp; Galaker.  Harold has been made Lance Jack &amp; stays in my section.  It will soon be four now &amp; then its "Stand to"  How the boys will love it  They have been spelling lately</p>
