  
 26 August 1918 Monday (X to X crossed out) X Have just read in the Town & Country journal of May 1st two columns of "piffle" headed Value of Cavalry.  It is a pity the editor allows such tripe to be copied from the New York Herald.X Thank God Recruiting has improved, it would shame many men to see some of the old chaps hanging on half dead with fever out here. Tried the stream with a Mess Tin for any "Color" but not much alluvial plenty big "crabs."
