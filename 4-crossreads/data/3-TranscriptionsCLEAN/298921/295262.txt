October, 1915Monday 18Definite advice to leave Tuesday so took Mardi & Miss Cook for a ride today to Zeitoun, & had dinner after they both are good horsewoman - Had gaol hair crop & sent Kit to T. Cook & sons & am already once more. Wrote letters home & to England & went to bed early as I am "short a gallop" & want to get into condition only soft & fat & a bit tender where the Turks branded me on the off thigh.Today a year ago the Reg sailed from Sydney & I took over [indecipherable] Camp Roseberry Park.
