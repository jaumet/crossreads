We chuckled & waited  - still no sign. At last we asked the man in the lookout box if he could see them.  He said, Oh yes they came out about 5 minutes before you did. We crawled away crestfallen & caught up with the others [Three photographs of, the party, the Dutch Garden & the Avenues, Hampton Court]
