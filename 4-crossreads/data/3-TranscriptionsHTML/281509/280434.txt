<p>1916 July 30<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>Bivouac in orchard under trees.   weather continues fine &amp; mild.   Nettleton still dopey since battle.   Go up to see Bob with Cartwright.   He comes back with us.</p>
<p>The old lady objects to us camping in orchard &amp; destroying grass.   Compromise by paying her 1 fr. Each.</p>
