Caught May 1916 & June 1916 [Note in margin:] Wednesday 31st - a chameleon & keeping same in dispensary. Going to try & educate him. They are not unlike a lizard in shape, "Charlie" being about 8" long. Can change their colour to whatever colour of background they are on. Have eyes independent of each other & can look both ways back & front at same time. One eye does not affect the other. Live chiefly on flies & insects. Fairly common on desert. June 1st - Did not finish with Turks op. etc until about 2 a.m. & I was not inclined to get up when 4.30 came. Glad I did & got things a little ship-shape. Between 6 & 6.15 am. Taube appeared over camp & dropped bombs. Did not see her until almost over lines. First bomb hit wireless aerial but otherwise no damage. Second lobbed right amid a troop of 3rd L.H & horse & human flesh scattered to the winds
