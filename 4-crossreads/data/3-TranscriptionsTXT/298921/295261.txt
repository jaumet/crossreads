October, 1915Sunday 17Arranged to go to dinner with Mrs Fletcher Mataria Railway today You see above appointment where I dined today.It strikes me as a coincidence that in my year for Matric in Literature, we had a lot about Greece & the narrows & the windy plains of Troy I never anticipated I should be fighting there.I have my Bear Skin Cape from Canada, Rubber boots, Sheepskin Waistcoat & muffs galore so shall be quite warm & conditions must be better now. Taking a tiny Portable Primus Lamp as no wood will be left now.
