Bank London for Identification Papers &amp; get them to advise me when it reaches there.  I do hope you won't have any trouble in getting through for me, Father dear.<br/>I am keeping in splendid health &amp; feeling very fit.  I do hope this finds you well.<br/>I must also thank you Mother dear for your very welcome letter to hand recently<br/>Mails are eagerly sought after here &amp; I am very seldom disappointed I am thankful to say.  Occasionally one of my letters take a stroll round Egypt, presumably for the good of its health, but it nearly always eventually reaches its right destination.<br/>Must close now with love to all at home<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
