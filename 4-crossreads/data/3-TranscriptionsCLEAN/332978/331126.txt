  
 47 August 29th Censor informed me that my  transfer  application to be transferred to Strohen, which was submitted on arrival at this Camp, has now been approved - I hardly know what to do, the only stumbling block is that by my going there now I might miss the Comm, on the other hand I am extremely anxious to be with Gardiner & co. I am very fed up with this camp & its environments 
 After the Censor had referred to records in connection with our exchange He sent for me again &  enlightened me very much  conveyed to me quite a lot of delightful information to the effect that my name with several others had been submitted as being eligible for exchange to England & that as the two Governments have not yet decided as to what route the transports would take, the exchange which was to have been effected on 24th August has been deferred till Septr. - He said that we should hear something definite early in Septr 
 I still think it to my advantage to wait here for a few weeks & if nothing is forth coming then  well  I have been assured that the transfer can be effected then.
