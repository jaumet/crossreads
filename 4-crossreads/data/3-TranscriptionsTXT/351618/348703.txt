Saturday 11th DecThe Ammunition Column was still to be served & I fixed them up this morning after the Anti Aircraft Gun. There was a good deal of excitement in air last night & to-day owing to a number of guns being ordered away from here & also men. They were to have gone last night but it was cancelled at the last moment. QMS McLaren came up in the afternoon & I went along Beach with him to pay a/c of Canteen Stores & also to cash cheques for him. He enticed me along to his quarters for tea. I returned about dark.
Sunday 12th DecThis morning I had everything cleared up.
