<p>Dear Beat &amp; Family<br/>Just a line to say we landed safe and sound at Alexandria on Saturday 26th of February and left by train at quarter to three in the morning for cairo 8 hours ride. The night we left their was a big steamer caught fire there were 4,000 cases of petrol on it so you can guess it was a beauty it was the biggest fire i ever saw in my life. I cannot tell you much about this camp yet Beat but i do not go much on it so far i wish they would shake it up and let us get into the firing line. You can tell Sim Powell that Jack Powell is here with us i know a terrible lot of the Australians here Joe Shaksphere is here and George Madich. Sam Harris and all the old Battalion that i was in before we got put in contact that time. Beat Egypt is the queerest place you ever saw you get paid in their money here and it is laughable you get mixed up with it there is no shilling or any thing like that it is all Piastre i will fetch some back with me there is nothing else but blacks here they will drive you mad wanting to clean your boots for on Half Piastre that means 1&frac12; a penny farthing in our money</p>
