<p>cleaning up the streets etc. Managed to get a supply of tobacco cigarettes etc. At one  place I saw a complete convoy of motors laden with heavy shells ready for the front.  Whether they were always held in readiness or were prepared to go up at night I do not know but probably the latter.  Altogether I saw a huge number of lorries.  Another interesting sight is to see the barges on the canals for the conveyance of wounded They average about 36 patients each &amp; go right down to Calais.  Steam barges do the towing also horses on the tow path &amp; tis wonderful what progress they can make, they are of course an ideal carrier being so quite &amp; steady.</p>
<p>Friday 7th July 1916<br/>Had a very steady day.   a heavy shower or two greeted us during the day a thing we are getting accustomed to once more.  Had practice in wearing gas helmets during the afternoon &amp; found them not half bad.  My chief trouble is the production of saliva which forms owing to having a mouth piece &amp; I have to continually remove it from my mouth in order to swallow.</p>
