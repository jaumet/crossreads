These duties finished about midnight when we made our way back to the dugouts where the boys turned in for a sleep. The living conditions for the troops in this reserve position were very good for we were able to have our three regular meals of a day, also have a good sleep when off duty for the wire bunks in the dugout were very comfortable. within a few yards of the Dug outs & situated behind a row of tall trees was a battery of four 4.5 Australian Howitzers which were very interesting to watch when they were firing. At dusk on the 11th I was detailed with a fatigue party having to report to Engineers in the communication trench in rear of the front line where we were put revetting the trench having to work until 3 A.M. next morning when we made our way  back to our quarters. After having a sleep on the morning of the 12th I had to go with an officer & four N.C.Os to Ypres to have a look over the route to the railway for I was to act as guide that night for our battalion was to be relieved. After proceeding to the railway so as to make sure of the way in darkness I was able to have a good look around the city of Ypres. There is very little to be seen now except the ruins for practically the only places that could be made out were Cloth Hall, the Asylum & Lille Gates the latter still being practically intact. it was shocking to see the way such a big city had been knocked about for as far as I could see there was not a whole wall of any building left standing. The roads were kept clear of all debris also in good repair for it was used exclusively by the military. The city was used for billetting small units in these men living in big dug outs among the ruins having the roof &[The image includes a hand drawn sketch map of the front line trenches around the Hill 60 sector in Belgium]
