 Saturday 13 April Now just out of Hazebrouck where we detrain after coming up via Doullens, St. Pol &amp; Lillers.  Things up here are very confused &amp; rumours are current as to the extent of the advance.  Some say the fighting is now round Merris &amp; Strazeele. We are forming an A.D.S. immediately.  All along the railway line are signs of recent bombing by the Germans. The A.D.S. is at Borre on Hazebrouck-Ballieul Road &amp; the Australians dug in on the Strazeele heights immediately after marching off the train. The Guards &amp; 29th Division are here, the men of the latter being very drunk &amp; disorderly. 
 Sunday 14 April A rotten North wind to-day.  No news from the line.  Still near St. Sylvestre Cappel, 4 or 5 kilos from Hazebrouck.  Everywhere you see troops who have been lost &amp; at the 1st A.C.C.S., things were left in an awful hurry. Line seems to be Nieppe Forest Estaires-Merris-Steenwerke, Ballieul being still in our hands. French troops are in the vicinity. The vicinity still throngs with refugees, poor beggars, young &amp; old, living in tents under tarpaulins anywhere along the road.
