<p>January 1918<br/>Sunday 6</p>
<p>At Beitin<br/>Received a considerable amount of mail from Australia, via friend Broome. also two magazines and a pair of gloves from "Mum"- my Cornish friend.<br/>Ah! tis indeed a pleasure to receive letters from home and perhaps they make me just a little homesick &ndash; at times.<br/>Received several "snaps" from Les Fuller, and a fairly long letter from Roy who seems to be getting better.</p>
