We travelled through country which had lately been devastated by war, right to Villers Brettaneaux [Villers Brettoneux] the place we [where] Fritz had been turned in his late big advance.  Villers Brettaneaux is very badly smashed about, but the village La Motte [Lamotte en Santerre] which is before it is much more so, this I am told was done by our own Artillery.  This road is a straight road lined with trees and is at least fifty miles long.  Large numbers of German prisoners were doing labouring work right along this road. 
 We reached our destination and we found it was situated 41/2 miles from Amiens.  We could see this city away in the distance with its beautiful Cathedral conspicuous above everything. 
 After a great deal of difficulty we managed to purchase a few of the things we wanted and we then made our way back with our heavy basket.  To get these few things we had already travelled over thirty miles.  After waiting some time on the road we got a M.T. which was going part of the way.  This we were very thankful for as it began to rain and big black cloud were lowering above us. 
 Spinning along the road we covered the distance much more quickly than we expected.
