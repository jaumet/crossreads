  
 November, 1915 Sunday 28 The Beach yielded a tin of Benzine last night, Tommy [indecipherable] my Batman is a Champion [indecipherable] I am wondering how it will  go  in a Primus Stove, it was really washed up. The trenches & Saps are in a frightful state of mud & the mules have difficulty in climbing the hill, with 10 gallons water on each side of Pack which Pack with Brass Plate is used as draft harness.  Will post this [indecipherable] knowing the future. Love to all  I am pleased to say I wear 3 stars now for Captain.
