1917 Sunday 8 April
Easter Sunday!! Last Easter Day we landed at Suez. What a life-time has been crowded into the last 12 months? New experiences- fresh outlooks. Will we see the expiration of another 12 months before this unfortunate business is ended.
Fatique duty during day.
McBurney self go for walk after tea to ruins of Martinpuich. Such a scene of desolation? Everything splintered to matchwood. Souvenirs ? The old Tank knockout blow on the forehead. Secure face of its brass clock. Long dead Fritzs Tommies lying about. 'Twas in Sept. last this area was taken. 
A beautiful sunny bright day Symbolical of the day.
