11/2/19 Charleroi
On the 13th. a local performance of Carmen is billed. We returned along the main road catching a lorry as far as Somzee. The temperature today is quite mild although snow covers the land everywhere. Back at Gourdinne at 4 and the chief excitement was an outbreak of fire near where H.Q. cooker used to be. A chain of workers with fire buckets soon put it out ? no damage. Cinema going again today. Went round to Legaits to say ?au revoir". Yvonne Raoul Marthe there. I cannot forgive these people for not washing. The human smell of unwashed bodies gets overpowering when the room gets warmed up. They speak of the French as dirty but if the French womans kitchen is not spotless her body at least is not an offence to the nose.
