<p>where we got cocoa. Then on to near Ypres-Roulers railway in a pillbox beyond Broodseinde about 5 miles direct from Ypres. Built up a dugout on far side of pillbox  very weak only protected by two sides of concrete about 2 ft high  Shelling very lively &amp; big stuff coming over very close to us. Spent a wretched night. Shelling intense especially against our pillbox and shells all round  one exploded against far side and heavy concussion. Wind blew the gases right in our door and we were nearly gassed. Up at 8 and helped clean pill box by draining and stink of dead meat strong. Shelling heavy all day. and enemy aeroplanes active and we couldn't light a fire. Night was calmer but counter attack at 6. One shell during night burst diagonally opposite our corner. Heavy barrage next morning.</p>
