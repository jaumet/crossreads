 Huns continue to come over.  Look like a flock of sparrows after a fly.  A few shells whistling about our lines during the night, never any in the day time. 
 10.11.1916   Beautiful day.  Big stunt, 5.30 till 9.15. A.M.  Air alive with Hun aeroplanes.  One gun 1st Bty blown.  One of our guns sent to workshops for repairs. 
 11.11.1916   Foggy morning, Indication of more rain.  The 1st Bty had 12 horses killed and wounded, also 2 men wounded.  The Bty was retreating,  We the 2nd Bty had to lend a hand, supplying horses and men, Turned out at 11 P.M.  Stupendous bombardment, all night, particularly intense just now 5.A.M.  Advanced 1600 yards, capturing a number of field pieces.  Major Matson A.D.V.S. inspecting our horses.  A bright lot I must say, about 30 out of action.  Asking why they were not groomed, nice question, considering that they were ploughing through mud up to their bellys all night.
