 Smugglers caves abound and this seems an ideal place for a rest. Came back via Abbotsham After lunch walked up a path alongside Torridge to Appledore &ndash; a winding track that passes once through a good fine wood with wealth of oaks. (Church at Clovelly has tablet to Will Cary). Appledore still does local ship repairing and the little yards were busy. From outside the town a good view of Westward Ho! Is obtained and the intervening country. Walked along the lanes to Northam an old place nestling round its church. An old stone by the roadside with a "Stop, stranger, stop!" directs attention to the fact that King Hubba the Dane met his death hereabouts. Bideford is not far distant. It is a pleasant stroll through the old twisting High Street and then past the old Ship Inn where the Brotherhood of the Rose had birth. Dialect a soft burr "Draive slow Maister please!". Not noticeable in middle class but pronounced in the lower order of people. At ordinary times Clovelly is deluged with day trippers this year fortunately free. A dear old place &amp; not modernised with asphalt like Bideford &amp; Northam.
