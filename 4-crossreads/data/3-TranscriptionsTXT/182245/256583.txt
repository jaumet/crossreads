 1917 MARCH 
 9 FRIDAY 
 Fine &amp; Sunny in the morning 
 but snowing &amp; blowing 
 very cold in the evening. 
 Cleaning up round the stables 
 in morning &amp; exercising horses 
 in afternoon. There was a Hun 
 plane over us this morning at 
 only about 500 or 600 ft &amp; they 
 could not get him. Got long 
 letters from Linda, Marj, Jo, 
 Eileen &amp; Mother. Sorry to hear 
 from mother that Aunty 
 Florence had died.
