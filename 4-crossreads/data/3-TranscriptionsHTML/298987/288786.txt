<p>Stunt as described before. It is about &frac12; mile from the jump off to the objective &amp; it has to be done in rushes of 30 to 100 yds. One is in full Battle order with 120 rounds ammunition &amp; 2 Bombs I was clean done by the time I reached the last trench &amp; could not have put up much of a fight it it had been a dinkum go Kit inspection in afternoon</p>
<p>Tuesday 23rd<br/>As it was raining hevily when we fell in this morning the Colonel sent us straight to our Huts instead of going about 1 mile to throw live Bombs as we should have done. Did nothing all day &amp; fell in at Y.M &amp; moved off about 8 for Warminster it is a good 5 mile march by the road we took The YM gave us a drink of tea &amp; biscuits about &frac12; way. The people waved &amp; cheered as if soldiers were something fresh &amp; a Draft goes along this road every week &amp; has done so for years. But it is allways the same anywhere I have marched evidently there is something about soldiers to interest people</p>
