The manner in which the beans are taken up is very interesting. They are pulled up by the the roots in bundles and turned upside down. There they are left for a few day. Then long poles about 3" in diameter and 7 ft long are placed in the ground. To the poles the roots of the beans are fixed and encircling the pole.
