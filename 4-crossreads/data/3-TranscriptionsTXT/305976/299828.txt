 Sections. Ambulance at present comprised 3 Sections A, B &amp; C. A Section N.S.W. B Section Vict C Section S.A &amp; Queenslanders. A. Section under S Major  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    (some bouncer) B Section Sgt  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    (dapper little Englishman) C Section Sgt  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (lusty youth) who shut his eyes when giving commands &amp; trusted to providence to pull him through.

He informed us in delightful language that they had a barb wire fence and he was not frightened to use it. A foolish remark for a man in his position to make.
