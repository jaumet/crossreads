<p>8/1/18 Bath<br/>Bath at about 3 and put up at the Royal hotel. Went into Bath Abbey a fine old place with walls thickly covered with tablets and pompous verbose epitaphs. The old Abbey dates from the 14th. century. The town appears a pleasant place and the shops good and thriving. Many soldiers about in hospital blue suits. The saluting farce is played to the bitter end and poor cripples try to salute too. There seem to be a great many historic houses here. Overlooking the town is a range of cliffs and the town is compactly in a valley. In springtime I should say that this is a very lovely place &ndash; even in winter's grip there is a charm about it. Dined at the hotel. The solemn state of English dinner gets me down after Parisian gaiety. Meagre helpings point to Food Control.</p>
