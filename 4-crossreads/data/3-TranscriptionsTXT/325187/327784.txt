[Tuesday 8 February 1916]
New moon & with 2 bright stars form the emblem of Egypt on Flags etc. (See images for diagram) lovely starlit nights.I suppose it will be a case of going out back again if a man pulls through this affair.The Illustrated London News 1/1/16 gives good picture of No.1 Outpost which we held to the last & I of that last at ANZAC.  As I read more about it I realize how lucky we were to get off.
