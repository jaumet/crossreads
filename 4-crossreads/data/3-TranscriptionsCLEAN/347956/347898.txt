  
 had dinner'  We were paid this afternoon  1.8.0 & I went to the skating rink after tea & witnessed some boxing tests & they were very good indeed;  I also had a ride on the scenic railway & the water chute;  Coming home I bought a bottle of Lungkura from the chemist in Heliopolis as I have a slight touch of a cold 
 I met Col Merrington & Col Plaine (the two Chaplains) there & accompanied the back to camp. they were also at the skating rink they are exceptionally fine men & very well liked by all the men
