<p>&amp;won't be sorry after [censored] hanging round doing nothing.<br/>The only sox I have received are a pair on the 16th Jany &amp; another pair with a face washer on the 19th Jany.  Both these were addressed in Mother's writing, so I don't know whether they are the ones you mean.  I have any amount on hand at present so that if a month or 6 weeks was to elapse between the sending it wouldn't be too long as they only take up room in my kit.  My sheepskin vest comes in for a lot of use &amp; is great &amp; warm.  We all received some gifts last Sunday &amp; included some very acceptable things an Anzac w/tablet, chocolate, handkerchief soap, &amp; last but not least a cherry wood pipe.  I have now broken this in &amp;,</p>
