<p>Alice for her birthday. Hope she had a real happy day   &amp;  will have lots of joy   &amp;  luck this year. Trust to be with you for next birthday. I suppose her little son was very excited   &amp;  made it a happy day for her. Have you quite decided to send him to school, where   &amp;  when &ndash; the poor little pet, will be quite a big boy when I return. Oh, what a pity we grow old.</p>
<p>It has got fearfully cold now, my feet   &amp;  hands are like ice.</p>
<p>Mrs Balfour's cake was delicious   &amp;  they all enjoyed Australia's cake. Dorothy got one but somehow her was not so fresh   &amp;  nice.</p>
