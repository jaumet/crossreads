<p>Since his advent we have had a much easier time, Major Prince being a better friend to <br/>the band than C.R.  Last night there was a Zep. Scare and every light in the camp was <br/>extinguished.  We think we saw a Zep but as there is nothing in the papers regarding it, <br/>it is improbable.<br/>We had to hand in all our surplus clothing and kit bags last night.  I don't suppose we will <br/>ever see them again.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <br/>Farewell concert in dining room at 8.  Brigadier &amp; 8 colonels present to present <br/>prizes won at Brigade Sports.</p>
