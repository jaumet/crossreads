  
 It was peculiar to observe the hundreds of brilliantly lighted cafes, cafes chantant, etc. all quite destitute of life! 
 At the little flat Frau Unteroffizier brought out coffee etc. & we had a small "spread", finally retiring in the parlour among the gilt-framed portraits, the pearl-inlaid photo album which Bruder Heinrich had brought home from China, etc.   Frau O. brought out dozens of feather-beds for her guest, and insisted on piling them on top of me after I had turned in. 
 Wed. 3rd Apl. At abt 10.30 am. we left the flat for the Bahnhof. 
 Got quite a good peep at Hagenbeck's Zoo from the "electrischer". 
 With the wonderful surroundings which Taronga has it should certainly in time eclipse Hagenbecks.
