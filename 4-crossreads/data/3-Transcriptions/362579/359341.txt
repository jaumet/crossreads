<p>We, most likely to leave in the morning. Hope it will be a fine day for travelling.<br/>We have had perfect weather this week but last night a fearful thunderstorm    &amp;  is raining heavily now.</p>
<p>Got up for early Communion this morning, quite a number of us attended this a.m. Had breakfast, so am writing before I finally pack.</p>
<p>We had a beautiful day for the Sports last Monday   &amp;  they were a great success. Concert in the evening   &amp;  were then told we were closing down on Wednesday.</p>
