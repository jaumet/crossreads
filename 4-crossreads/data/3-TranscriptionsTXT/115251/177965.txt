 II.&nbsp; The step to be taken is accounted for by the desertion of troops and laborers - the reason for which must be put down to fear and the fact of losing their old officials. 
 III.&nbsp; Those officials who are on parole are bound by their word of honor.&nbsp; This has not been broken.&nbsp; The parole is respected all over the world, also by those who take it.
