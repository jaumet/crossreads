 the brickworks (between St. Denis and Mont St. Quentin) and by vigorous action the enemy was forced to withdraw from St. Denis.  Meanwhile the ramparts and the N.E. end of Peronne were cleared of the enemy and an attempt made to exploit towards Flamicourt and Chairwood, but this was frustrated for the time being by heavy machine gun fire. 
 The day's fighting had been very severe, the enemy fighting stubbornly and never yielding until forced to do so. 
 A large number of the enemy were killed and a considerable number of prisoners captured.  The prisoners for the three days' fighting for Mont St. Quentin and Peronne amounted to 45 officers and 1621 other ranks.  Six guns and a very large number of machine guns were captured. 
 During the course of the 3rd and 4th September Flamicourt and Chair Wood were taken by the 5th Division and the enemy was finally cleared from the neighbourhood of Peronne. 
 The result of the operations during the latter part of August had so disorganised the enemy that a general retreat on his part became imperative. 
 The operations of the Corps up to this date had been carried out with the five Divisions and 32nd Division (English).  The latter Division, most ably commanded by Major General T.S. Lambert, C.B., C.M.G., had borne its part with great resolution and gallantry. 
 The total number of enemy divisions engaged and defeated by this Corps from 8th August to 4th September was twenty-eight of which six were engaged twice, one three times and four have since been disbanded.
