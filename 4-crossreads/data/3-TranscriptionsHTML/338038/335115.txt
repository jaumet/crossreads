<p>II<br/>ever since the transfer went through I have been doing duty in different Batteries &ndash; owing to fellows getting hit and going sick etc there is nearly always a vacancy or two in the Batteries. Am now in the 7th Battery (Queensland) in place of Richards who has gone to Hospital in Alexandria with fever of some sort.<br/>Colonel Rosenthal is frequently round having a look at us. He was hit again a night or two again by shrapnel but I do not think he will have to go away. Jack Playfair has returned to duty, and also Ted Olding, but their Batteries of course are operating in the Southern Zone so that I never see anything of them.<br/>I am glad to hear recruiting is still going strong. Am not surprised to hear Les is coming away. He has been considering it for some time. I saw Charlie Addison here the other night but I was just bringing a gun into position so did not get a chance to speak to him<br/>II</p>
