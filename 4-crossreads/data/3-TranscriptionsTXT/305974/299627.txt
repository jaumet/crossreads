 6 Thursday We decided to go through the tower of London in the morning so after breakfast caught a taxi out, which cost us s1/8d .  We were allowed through the historic parts at 10 am, also seeing very ancients relics of battles, historic places &amp; the crown jewels valued at 5 millions pounds.  We also saw the Tower Bridge.  Didn't go anywhere during the evening, only played billiards at the club.  Caught 10.15 train from Waterloo for Tidworth 
 7 Friday Arrived at Tidworth station about 1.30 am, it was raining very heavily &amp; we had to walk to Parkhouse Camp, (about 4 miles). It was very dark along the road. Rained very heavy during the day.  Medical inspection held during the evening.  Developed the photos I took in London, but they didn't come out too good, through over exposure, also done some printing after tea. 
 8 Saturday More men picked for field ambulance to go to France &amp; another batch of Hospital men sent to Bulford for training.  Owing to saturday being half holiday I took the opportunity of printing about 60 photos.  I am going to keep a print for myself &amp; sending the negatives home.  Nothing in particular happens 
 9 Sunday Bought a camera for 15/- (Brownie No 2) &amp; sold mine for 10/- which I think was a bargain.  Went for a walk after tea. Attended church parade in the morning.  Looked like rain in evening.
