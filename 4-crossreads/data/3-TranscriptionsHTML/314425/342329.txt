<p>Another batch of German U. boats surrendered yesterday. The officers looked ashamed but the men were not.</p>
<p>Tuesday Nov 26 1918. 16.<br/>There is a light misty rain all this morning. This evening I made up a parcel for my wife containing the following. 1 envelope &ndash;  12 French P.C. of Abbeville, 1 envelope - 12 views of Devonport &amp; Plymouth. 1 envelope &ndash; 21 P.C. views of Boulogne and 5 others mostly of famous views that were [indecipherable] dug outs. 50 P. Cards in all.</p>
<p>Wednesday Nov 27 1918. 17.<br/>A fine mild day. I sent two Anzac Bulletins</p>
<p>to my wife &amp; 2 P.C. to A. Kennedy &amp; posted the packet of Post Cards in Devonport this afternoon. I had a ramble around Devonport today passed the barracks the General's house &amp; the Admiral's House, the bluff which slopes steeply down to the waters edge. In the Sound which is very narrow there are three training ships anchored fore &amp; aft. One of them is the last wooden war ship built &amp; the other the first ironclad.<br/>In the distance I could see the break water stretching away in front of the entrance and the place where the "Persic" hove too on our arrival from Australia.</p>
