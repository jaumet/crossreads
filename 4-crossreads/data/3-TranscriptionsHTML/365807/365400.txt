<p>After some 8 days the School shifted further East, nearer the Line. There I got the welcome news of my Commission, and in accordance with orders, reported for duty to the 13th &ndash; a N.S.W. Bn. with a fine record.  The C.O. and everybody were most extraordinarily kind to me. General W.- thought it best for the present for me to remain under my assumed name. I judged from his remarks that many political influences are brought to bear on Birdwood, and he does not want to run any risk of having any unpleasantness with the Australian authorities.  So I am at present a 2nd LT. But Generals W.- &amp; Birdwood did not take long over my Commission &ndash; I saw the former on April 22 and my Commission dates from April 26.</p>
<p>Many of the officers in the 13th knew me personally or by name &ndash; and the change of name caused a good deal of mystification, which was all rather amusing. But they were most good. Drank my health at mess the first night - &amp; the C.O. made such a nice speech.</p>
