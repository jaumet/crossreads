<p>May 13, 14<br/>Mail:  T.L.S., May, but still no "Reincarnations".  A review of two volumes of Trench's "Poems &amp; Prose Parables".</p>
<p>All day dull, rain and drizzle, and no sun.</p>
<p>Last night of the Assryian.  I wrote his suggestion in a manner of Jake:  tonight he is Jake.</p>
<p>May 14<br/>135.<br/>p.m.<br/>This morning two 2 L.T.M.B. men through:  after the few bad stretcher cases through during the night, they with their accidental wounds caused by badly set guns, brought from the line some of the manner and attitude of the Infantry.</p>
<p>And today the sun was brilliant and warm:  all the morning I lay out in an adjoining field deep with new grasses and buttercups &ndash; lay awhile reading, then half sleeping.  Shells going over seemed reluctant sacrileges and 'crunchers' in the villiage ashamed even in their bursting.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon planes over, and balloons droping phamplets [pamphlets]:  a small white globe lazily and slowly drifting across the blue and slowly smiling below it great branches of loosened leaves, visible when the sun flicked them, making them like great shoals of tiny fish on the water surface.</p>
<p>May 14<br/>Mail:  "To-Day", May number:  an article on James Joyce, his "Exiles", a play I'll write for as soon as I've settled somewhat of my account with T.B.C.  Would like to read his "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" and "Dubliners".</p>
<p>From Rusty T. my "English and Welsh Cathedrals".  I'd given up hope of its reappearing &ndash; thought the Boche would have it from La Clyte.</p>
<p>The rumour of the day is of the Boche massing in front of us:  but its obvious truth takes greatly from facinating elaboration.</p>
<p>Bill F. down to H.Q. today brings back the telling of C. Section being relieved by B. &ndash; they back from [indecipherable].  The super-egotists seem our inevitable "second half".</p>
<p>136.<br/>Hungarian Melodies, Vol. 1.  Jack Raisbeck had them first at Durnshire Lines, and he played them to George Eaton's singing.  Tonight I rescued our "Ghutz" copy from the Musick and read through the book.  The old favourite, the first Jack played &ndash; and then only on the Dulcitone but most exquisitively &ndash; still stands out from the others.  "Mourning in the Villiage Dwells" with its sobbing melody and passion and its strange terrible words all that indescribable beauty of old legends and Gothick carvings.</p>
