<p>JUNE &nbsp; SUNDAY 11 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>A rotten cold rainy windy day. About the coldest we have had. We have not seen the sun since we came here and the mist has been over Table Mountain all the time except half an hour. There was a &quot;Little Penguin&quot; along side the boat all the morning diving &amp; swimming about. Another transport came in this morning. There was to be a church parade in memory of Lord Kitchener, but the weather stopped it. Came off guard at 6 oclock and was jolly glad to be relieved as I was nearly frozen to death.</p>
