will have passed. Reg Bridge was thoughtful to write home and ask his people to care for you. I must write to him a short note.   London is an attractive place for any kind of man with capacity for thinking.Nothing had been done at Queen's Square before I left.

I have not seen Pierro Fiaschi lately. I hope that Joseph enjoyed the races.  Penshurst looks well from a distance as a home fit for any one to live in.
Joseph dear: / Yours of the beginning of April.   The photos by Doris.   Many thanks for them.   What has my Kitty done to her hair.  I did not know her in the new style she has adopted for carrying her cheveux.   The jakaranda, the corner of bricks, & the greenery behind Kitty make a picturesque background for two girls of the best.   Kitty near the peltate leaves [shield-shaped leaves] and the filter is somewhat dark.   How well the fern & other plants have grown Joe dear.   Why they quite envelop you seated in the corner.  And Non looks ready for bed with dishevelled locks and white robe.  Kitty & Doris are shaded by the Jackaranda.   Very pleasing to me all.   Thanks for them.
