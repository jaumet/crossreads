<p>shelling Poperinghe this morning</p>
<p>23.9.1916  Saturday   Weather fine, nights cold, Hun planes busy.  Winter clothing will be issued in a few days, consisting of 2 shirts, 2 pairs of underpants, 3 pairs of socks, Gum boots for gunners, and Canadian top boots for drivers.  Our boys in wagon line made a raid on a potatoe patch, the consequence was, a camp commandant with a Belgian interpreter made their appearance, and the unit has to pay 35 Francs.  An officer is now at wagon line, the first time in France.  Large body of Infantry going to trenches.  Tons of material going up, to trenches, by all accounts they have to be rebuilt.  They are in a horrible state.  No wonder the Canadians got slaughtered there</p>
<p>24.9.1916  Sunday   Went to Reninghelst Church, Three priests officiating.  The sermon was in Flemish.  Strange service,   Seemed to be a high mass and Benediction combined.  The only church where change is given.  The first collection</p>
