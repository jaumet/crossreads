Tucker is very poor in this C.C.S. We live like princes in our C.C.S. in comparison to this one.

Went to Poperhinge along with D. I. The place was crowded with troops. A nice place but badly knocked about by shells Big numbers of Observation balloons are in close touch here.

Beautiful morning, shrapnel being sent into Pop to-day.

Five new teams arrived here to-day mostly Americans.

July 23rd. Mon.
There are four C.C.S.’s here and each takes it in turn to receive patients

The railway runs through between and troops, ammunition etc are continually going up and down here.

Heavy, continuous, bombardment is going every night now.

Got orders to return back to our unit to-day

Had a very pleasant stay here and incidently learned a few tips

These C.C.S.’s have been here for about two years. They have there grounds nicely laid out, growing flowers and vegetable on their spare land.

There is a great many wounded up in these part, heavy fighting is the rule, and Hospital trains go down here every day.

From Bailleul we get one view of Mount Des Cats and Mount Noir from Remy Siding we get the other view
