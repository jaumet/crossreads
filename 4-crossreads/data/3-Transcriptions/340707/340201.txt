<p>At 7 pm there is a choir of 10,000 which perform in Hyde Park</p>
<p>I dine tonight at Pinveli &amp; lucky to get in as special dinners are being given in every caf&eacute;s called Victory dinners &amp; every table has been booked for weeks ahead.</p>
<p>I meet an Englishman &amp; his wife John O. Mayes of Constantia, Cienfuegos Cuba &amp; now of Overseas Club, Aldwych London) &amp; we join up in order to get in as there is a table for 3 available.</p>
<p>Inside all is a wild scene of revelry. A party of RAF &amp; WRAF in one corner 2 opera or theatrical singers near by a Belgian woman &amp; her husband a spanish lady all more or less half seas over &amp; all making the greatest possible amount of noise.</p>
<p>We order a boule of Chianti not knowing what a bottle is &amp; behold a bottle which takes both hands to hold &amp; about 18 in high arrives. Much excitement is caused by its arrival &amp; many participate in its contents. One Aussie from Egypt a law student from Adelaide nips me for 10/-.</p>
<p>Fun runs high &amp; I did all sorts of things like the rest. Autographs are frequently collected &amp; 2 chaps collect me &amp; we do a forward rush down room clearing all before us including tables</p>
