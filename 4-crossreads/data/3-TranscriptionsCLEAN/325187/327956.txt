[Tuesday 1 August 1916]
One of our boys who got surrounded by Turks yesterday has turned up:- He hid in a Bush & lay "perdu" with Turks all around him till dark then he managed to crawl back through their outpost.  A good performance & shewing a cool head.  Ours are the best in the world when on their own initiative, & the longer one soldiers with them the more one appreciates their qualities.  Rough diamonds perhaps but plenty of Guts.3 Enemy planes bombed our Camp today- The Tommies suffered most each Plane carries about 12 Bombs of 20 lbs. each they also throw hand grenades but no DARTS.
