<p>The service was identically the same as that for the Church of England.   The ship was rolling a good deal &amp; we had some difficulty in maintaining the erect position when the hymn "Stand up, stand up for Jesus" was being rendered.   We sighted Cocos or Keeling Island at 10.30 AM &amp; were quite close to it for 2 &frac12; hours but saw no trace of the "Emden".    There are several islands in the group &ndash; they are all very low lying with white sandy beaches &amp; numerous coconut palms.<br/>On Monday 21st the sports for the nurses came off.   I took part in the "biscuit eating" tune whistling event.    In this, the men are each told a certain tune &amp; race from one end of the deck to their partners, who hand them a large biscuit which has to be hurriedly eaten.   As soon as this has been accomplished the tune has to be whistled &amp; when the lady has got the tune she writes it down on a piece of paper &amp; her partner then races off to the finishing point.  The efforts at disposing of the very dry biscuit &amp; at endeavouring to make one's partner appreciate what tune is being whistled were in many cases quite ludicrous.   In my heat I managed to dispose of the biscuit first</p>
