The gun crew worked in 10 inches of slush. A heavy minenwerfer appeared to be trying to drive the gun detachment away by air bursts. Sgt STAFFORD observed.No2 gun:- during the firing of this gun one charge ignited as soon as it was placed in the piece, owing to the overheating of the gun and scorched one of the men's eyes. This caused a delay of 10 minutes. The bed gave trouble near the finish and it had at least 14 inches of play lengthwise. A heavy minenwerfer operated around the gun firing 12 rounds.2/Lt BARRON observed.No3 gun:- on firing the 7th round the rifle mechanism blew out.
