[These six brief stories have been written in response to a request by the editor of the NSW Anzac Memorial for interesting stories of bravery, humour, sadness etc, from returned servicemen.  If suitable the stories would be published in a book The Anzac Memorial which was published in 1919.  It is interesting to note the difference between the language used in war diaries where the writers were writing for themselves, and these stories where the writers were hoping to be published.]
