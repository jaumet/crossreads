<p>19th Batt<br/>Popes Post<br/>5-12-15</p>
<p>Capt Hale,<br/>Please let me know if I will be able to procure a new Garland Mortar as the one we have does not throw the Garland bombs the distance which it should.<br/>The Corporal in Charge has reported to me that in making up the Garland Bombs he has to use 7 Drams of powder for a charge in place of the 5 drams (the recognised quantity of powder).  Therefore we require extra powder to provide sufficient charges for the number of bombs in stock.</p>
