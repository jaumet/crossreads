<p>V<br/>here -  I would not advise bringing an extensive kit &ndash; Underclothes I think can be purchased better in Australia than in England, but all other articles could be left till he got to London.

<p>Later 12/2/918<br/>I put this on one side finding there was no mail till today &ndash; I was round the 110th How Battery today &amp; was accosted by a prosperous looking Bombardier (1 stripe)  Asked me if I remembered him which I did.  Turned out to be one Agatter (friend of the Pitts) whom we used</p>
