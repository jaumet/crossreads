  
 a Catholic.  Rather a good joke.  I  am  a Catholic & he is C. of E.  We had some more trips (Tram) & had tea at the same place.  While there the lady running the show gave several addresses of Mademoiselles to the Soldiers & also engaged in an animated discussion with an Australian about Zig Zigs & Nic Nics despite the presence of several Ladies & two young Girls.  The Soldiers smashed two Station doors crowding in to get their Train.  It was an awfull crush.  The M.P. Redcaps were absolutely powerless.  On the way home on the train we passed a number of small vegetable Gardens intersected & divided in every direction by small Canals.  The Gardeners were travelling in & around their plots in long boats with upturned ends.  Not unlike very shabby Gondolas. 
 Saturday 2-6-17 The Mill is becoming a tower of Babel.  Today there were several Portuguese knocking about.  Between Niggers Germans French Portuguese & English a man gets confused.
