<p>Eva's parcel &amp; 10 letters. Friday 10th November we went on duty at about 10.15AM at the 1st post. A taube was brought down by anti-aircraft fire, it fell like a stone, another was hit, &amp; after wabbling &amp; dropping for a while, righted itself. We had an easy day and night. Saturday news of Vic being wounded. We moved right up to factory Corner (about 5 mile from the base) it is close to the firing line, we had an easy day and night. Sunday 12th November 1916 we were relieved about 11 AM &amp; went to the Base. I received Aunt Nell's parcel &amp; 2 letters, it is rainy looking though it hasn't rained for about 4 days.</p>
<p>Monday 13th foggy Morning we went on duty at the "Crest" Our 'boys' jumped over at 9AM (5th &amp; 7th Brigade, with British on right &amp; left of them) to do what the 7th Brigade failed to do last Sunday week, we won two trenches, but believe we lost them again. I got hit this morning a piece of shell is still embedded in my pocket book. We are terribly busy carrying. Tuesday 14th fine, still busy, at about 3.30 we went right up to Goose Alley &amp; had a very busy time, I nearly cracked up over it. Wednesday cold wind blowing, still very busy. We were relieved at 4PM &amp; arrived at the base just as it was beginning to get dark. Thursday lovely day very frosty morning, mud frozen, got 4 letters. Sunny day though cold we left the Dump 1.30PM &amp; went on duty at Drop Alley at 2.15PM. Friday, Frosty, ice an inch thick on the shell holes, Sunny but cold, we were relieved at 1.30PM &amp; we went to North Post, we had an easy time. We have been lucky lately in securing German dug-outs, when we are not lucky we have to make our own.</p>
