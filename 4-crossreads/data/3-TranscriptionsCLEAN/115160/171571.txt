 Don't post any more parcels. I hear that Demobilisation is to commence in February and it is hoped that all the Aussies will be home before 12 months have elapsed.  I sent you one box of glassware which I hope will reach you safely. 
 1st Dec. 
 It has turned very cold so may snow shortly.  Our wee mob is remaining here, whereas 'others have a good 100 kilos before them tomorrow.  I wouldn't fancy the trip. 
 Well I'm quite OK. I have just been to our Railhead P.O. & there are abouot 20 bags of letters & parcels to be collected by our Postal Orderly which accounts for the non-arrived of our mails. 
 I hope you are all in the best of health and enjoying yourselves in the warm weather.  Its not long now to Christmas, and we will all have a cheerier outlook before us this time. 
 Fondest love to Dad, Bess & Mum 
 Your loving son,
