<p><u>12<sup>th</sup></u> <u>Dec</u>.</p>
<p>Had a hell of a job last night.&nbsp; Was one of a fatigue party carrying Stokes Shells to a trench mortar position behind the front line.&nbsp; They weighed 54 lbs each &amp; we had to carry em a mile over shell holed &amp; muddy ground.&nbsp; To add to the enjoyment Fritz used to periodically play a tune on his machine gun &amp; the bullets hummed over our heads like bees</p>
