  
 weather on Gallipoli Coast is said to be too rough for landing troops. 
 Tues. 2nd Nov. 1915. 
 On guard last night & the other Refts (4th & 5th Troop destes) rioted & broke down the hatchways to the stores & got plenty of bottled ale etc. There was a lively time & cigarettes & chocolate were all over the show. Captain of ship threatened to shoot some but a lot of notice they took of him. This is one of the effects of keeping us here at anchor in Mudros & not putting  us on shore at all. Some ship was on fire in the harbour last night - don't know its name. This morning we all have to tranship on to the "Osmanieh" - supplied with 200 rounds of ammunition. Been putting oil into a monitor that drew alongside of us. The "Mauretania" as a hospital ship looked a fine sight as we left. Landed at ANZAC &  spent remainder of night sleeping in holes dug out in Shrapnel Gully. Firing going on all night over the ridges. This is a weird place. 
 Wed. 3rd. Nov. Shifted up towards our battalion this morning & we are being drafted towards different Coys. of the 4th. Doing the night on the flat
