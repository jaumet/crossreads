gunners stood close to her when they fired her they would be killed by the concussion which is very great. 
Was out on patrol again tonight with Kelleway Traill, had to go out nose round an old pill box which looked suspicious they thought the Hun had a machine gun in there but luckily he didn't, the ground was very slippery hard as steel.
14th. Had to go take over 5.O.11 after finishing my patrol I put in a very cold night waiting for the Boche just before we were relieved it started to snow soon the ground was as white as a sheet all tracks were covered, I had to take my party out use my judgement for direction I got out alright but you wouldn't believe how easy it is to get lost when the snow is on the ground you are on flat country, some of our chaps are always getting bushed, have almost walked into Fritzs hands.
