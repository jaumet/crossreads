<p>the Turks were going to sweep them into the sea &amp; he had orders to stand by to pick them up if it had come to pass. But they managed to hang on. He also spoke disparagingly of their fighting qualifications.</p>
<p>Tuesday 25th. We were apportioned to various duties such as gathering stones to mark a boundary for our camping ground carrying water &amp; then was commenced preparing "dug outs" for sleeping quarters. We all had different designs. For myself I burrowed into a bank for a couple of feet for my kit &amp; then erected a staging to carry a blanket to keep off the dew. We also had a swimming parade which made my fourth swim in Mudros Harbour up to date. The water is beautiful for swimming just now.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th. Spent the day doing various fatigue duties &amp; improving my 'dug out' &amp; ending up with a swim. We had the sinking of the "Triumph" verified today, the Turks are certainly giving us something to think about. I have just been warned for Guard duty 2AM to 6AM. We reinforcements are having more than our share of such work. For some reason we have not yet been allotted to a section &amp; any dirty work is shunted onto us. No more reinforcements for me. The very name makes me wild now. It is not as if the reinforcements were an inferior lot, they are a jolly sight better than half the old corps.</p>
<p>Thursday 27th. On guard 2A.M. to 6A.M. 2P.M. &ndash; 6P.M. but duties a sinecure. We managed to get a loan of a marquee in case of bad weather. It is the latest pattern from England &amp; is a fine</p>
