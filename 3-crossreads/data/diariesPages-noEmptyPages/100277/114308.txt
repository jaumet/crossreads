We were bound for "Noordoopene" quite naturally lost our way marched nearly 4 miles out of our track, didn't we swear when we had to "about turn" for we were foot weary tired for we had already marched 12 miles, however we reached our billets in time, the space they had allotted for the Coy. was not half enough so there was more trouble, but this was fixed up eventually, we then had a feet inspection, after that all the Platoon commanders with the exception of mine shouted beer for their men.
A Small mail came in here I received 4 letters out of it so I done alright We are camped in a lovely little place the paddock surrounding the barn is as green as it possibly
