<p>You will be pleased to hear that no liquor is allowed into the camp and that the Officers are very strict on this point. Soft drink can be obtained on the ground but nothing stronger than Ginger beer. One of the recruits with us was foolish enough to bring a couple of bottles of beer out with him and as a result he spent his first night in the guard tent and forfeited his beer.<br/>I was very pleased to receive your letter &amp; but as I had already made all arrangements to go into camp I could not take advantage of your suggestion even if I had desired to do so. There is a male class of about 60 sitting for the St. John's Certificate next Tuesday and I intend sitting with them. I called on the Secretary of the Association who informed me that I could do so as the class rolls would show that I had attended the prescribed course of lectures at Lismore. I will then be listed for the A.M.C  as beforementioned.<br/>I was very glad to hear of Douglas's money making capacity but , or course, It does not surprise me. He has a splendid career in front of him and by the time he has attained my years will be a man of standing in the Community and a great help and comfort to you.<br/>I knew you would be very disappointed to hear that I had passed but it is all for the best, I am sure, and feel that I have only done my duty by enlisting. It would be very uncomfortable for us all if I remained behind when all  the  other young men in my position were at the front. Besides Douglas would have gone had I remained and he will be a much greater</p>
