 Headquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle East. GS 742 24/7/1918. 
 The General Officer Administering, Australian Imperial Force in Egypt, General Headquarters, E.E.F., 1st Echelon. 
 I forward herewith a Report which I have received from the G.O.C. Palestine Brigade on No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps. 
 I wish to associate myself most emphatically with the remarks of General Borton. 
 The Squadron arrived in Egypt on 13th April 1916. The majority of the personnel had never seen an aeroplane or engine in their lives. Some of the Officers had flown machines to a limited extent, whilst others had never flown at all. They arrived without equipment or machines. 
 The procedure adopted to train the Squadron in the duties that were before them was as follows:- 
 The whole Squadron was divided up into detachments under their effective officers and were attached to the existing two R.F.C. Squadrons in the country. Each man and Officer understudied a corresponding man and officer in the R.F.C. Squadrons. At the end of each week's training the personnel was reported upon under three headings, A.B. and C. representing different standards of efficiency. 
 being good workmen, efficient &ndash; could do work without supervision.  being promising, but requiring further supervision  requiring training. 
 Under these conditions, the Squadron worked for six weeks and their progress was very remarkable. At the end of the six weeks practically 80% of the Squadron had attained (a) standard of efficiency. This being the case, I decided to mobilise the Squadron. 
 For this purpose, I concentrated the Squadron at Heliopolis, and at the end of the first six weeks mentioned above, the first Flight mobilised. 
 By 14/6/1916 the first Flight was despatched to Suez, and the mobilisation of the second Flight took place. In a very short time the whole Squadron was mobilised and on active service, some units being despatched as far out as the Kharga Oasis and operating over Dakhla Oasis. This rapid training and mobilisation of the Squadron reflected great credit on the industry, keenness and discipline of the Officer and all ranks. 
 Major T.F. Rutledge was in command of the Squadron at the time, and to him is largely due the fine spirit evinced by the Squadron as a whole. 
 From these early days up to the present time the Squadron has never looked back. It has improved in efficiency until I have no hesitation in saying that, at the present moment, this Squadron ranks as one of the best Squadrons in the Royal Air Force. 
 On the 1st July 1918 I inspected this Squadron at its present aerodrome at Ramleh. Its interior economy workshops, and discipline are excellent. The Turn out of its mechanics, transport, and above all of its aeroplanes are models of their kind. 
 Its present high state of efficiency is largely due to the ability of its Commanding Officer, Major R. Williams, D.S.O. and to the energy and enthusiasm which all Officers, Warrant Officers and other ranks display in their work.
