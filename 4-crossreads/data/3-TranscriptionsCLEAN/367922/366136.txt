 My dear Arthur I dare say you have thought the one hundred and Fifty pounds I promised you some time ago, a long time in putting in its appearance. However it only makes good the old saw & "better late than never". 
 I had hoped to have heard from my Brother respecting the matter, but cannot allow you to wait any longer, I have not heard from him for a very long time. My firm had a letter from him a couple of months ago about some wines he had in Sydney belonging to us, which he has now sent home and which have safely arrived - 
 The 150 is for you to do, just what you like with. I shall send this letter open to your Mother that she may peruse the cash. I having had the Bill made out in her name, in case you might be absent from Sydney akin this arrives 
 Wishing you every success in business and with Love to your Brothers & Sisters believe me my dear Arthur 
 Your ever eff. Uncle John S. Hall 
 (all well at Bondican House)
