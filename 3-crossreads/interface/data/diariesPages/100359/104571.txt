Tuesday 4th
Got parcel from France am doing very well lately. Read out on orders that an A. Section man is appointed "Bakshee" Corporal in B. Section. B.Section are quite insulted about it and paraded to "Maud" and told him just what they thought, but poor little "Maud" is afraid of the Col. so I suppose this is as far as it will go. Still raining
Very heavily. Went for Route March with our new Major, Macartney, who has changed over from the 14th F. Amb, with Major Lind, Mac and I spent a pleasant morning at Madames. Everybody is broke and we are anxiously awaiting the arrival of our pay. Rain cleared off a bit at night, and Mac and I went for a walk and met "Johnnie Walker" in an estaminet, and enjoyed his company. 
Wednesday 5th
Pay arrived at last. We got 25 Francs each, which was marked in our Pay Books 17/11. What a time the 8th brigade had. Every shop in the village was packed with soldiers, and one had a hard job to purchase anything at all. I have been stoney broke for some time, and to put a cap on things I go and break my bloomin? pipe and have had to be content with a clay dab, for which I paid a penny. Mac, Wright Bert, Hunt and I visited the estaminets and had some French wine, and also had a good feed. Fried eggs and bread and butter and coffee.
Thursday 6th
More rain and plenty of mud, had another good feed of eggs. These French eggs are 3 times the size of Egyptian eggs and one can get a decent feed from 3 or 4 of ?em. Nothing much doing in camp as its too wet. We got a pleasant surprise today they gave us another 25 francs, so everybody is up to cash now.

Big mail in today. I got 3 long letters from Lill and 1 from Mother also 2 photos from Katoomba. Quite the nicest letters I have ever had. They all look jolly well on the pictures. They are not taking in any mail, so we can't send away any letters, which is jolly hard luck, as we have
