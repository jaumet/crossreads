 Sunday 2 July 1916 Slept until nearly 9 o'clock &amp; did enjoy it. The day turned out to be beautifully fine with a fair breeze blowing. Remained quietly inside &amp; got a little mail written, but found that the sitting yarning hindered me a good deal &amp; really very little writing was done. A beautiful peaceful evening &amp; lovely sunset. Very quiet night.
