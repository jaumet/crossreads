  
 27-9-17 Our lads are doing splendidly on this big stunt now in progress. Saw 500 prisoners pass by to-day things are moving on the front. Mack &' I went to see my friend Lydre at Reninghelst to-night & received a great welcome. We helped her milk the cows (4) Mack milked one & I held the candle & laughed. There was Mack with his hat on & gas helmet across his shoulders & full uniform with a bucket between his knees working hard & Lydie breaking all records next to him it was a funny picture. It was quite dark & the perfume was none too pleasant. A glass of milk was handed round & afterwards a cup of coffee. 30-9-17. Great excitement last night
