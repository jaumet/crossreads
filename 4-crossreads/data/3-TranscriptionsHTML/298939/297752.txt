<p>Friday 13th April<br/>Definite news today that we go to Bulford on Tuesday for King's Review.<br/>Heard from Dad today that he cannot come down just now; I fancy it will not be possible to see him before I go over.<br/>Were drilled all the afternoon by a Capt.<br/>Feeling fairly fit &amp; happy &amp; am quite anxious to get over to France to try my luck<br/>It will need to be good I fancy for the boys who left in the draft after the one I should have gone on have lost several wounded already</p>
