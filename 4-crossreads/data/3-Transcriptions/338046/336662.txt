<p>1918<br/>Jany<br/>was put in charge of our company, early in January and Sgt Major McKinnon (Horse's haed) as Sgt Major. We did not like either of them and they did not like us. They had been informed, I think, that D Company were a lot of roughnecks and they intended to tame us. Being very cold I did not like shaving in the early morning. One morning my overcoat saved me. We were being inspected on parade and having a full sized "ziff" turned up the collar. I looked fairly decent above that. The OC only looked at me from the side and passed me but Jim Copeland who was next to me and had not shaved, had not time to turn up his collar and got caught. Fined 5&frasl;-.<br/>Goldie and McDermott (our runners) in a convivial moment one night determined to do away with Capt Thompson. So getting well inked up first, they both set on him just inside the cement factory gates. Subsequent events were rather mixed but the two of them were carried home by friends and the Captain looked none the worse in the morning</p>
