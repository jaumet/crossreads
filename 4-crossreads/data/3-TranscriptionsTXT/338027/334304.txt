 To my Mother 
 So your baby has sailed away to war He could not resist the call And your heart is sad, but proud to know That you have given the nation your all 
 The three that you nursed in childhood Who to manhood now have grown The three your castles were built on And the dreams we have never known 
 Sacrifice is a duty of war That mothers have sadly learnt And prouder have a soldier son Than keep a coward spurned 
 You must feel proud to think now That your duty has been obeyed And three of your sons were fighting In the name Australians made.

 To my friends mother 
 I realize your love, friend Of which you often speak A mother's love is sacred, Tho' her son be strong or weak 
 And I know the bond is strengthened When we are far away, Mother's love is telepathy And through this bond they pray 
 For the baby they reared to manhood For he is their baby still. Striving in a nation's crisis, Manhood's duty to fulfill. 
 We are helping the helpless In the cruellest of all wars Whilst mother brushes the tear away And helps in the needful cause. 
 I have a mother like you friend And my feelings are just the same, It is up to us to reward their love And make them proud of our name.
