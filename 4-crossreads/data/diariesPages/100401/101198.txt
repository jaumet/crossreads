Sunday 18
 The last day. This morning round the parks, Row, Palaces Oxford Street. A fine walk on Sunday morn. This afternoon evening to Richmond along the Thames with Miss Starkie. A beautiful night with many searchlights reflections on the river.
Monday 19
 At Bolougne. Leave Victoria Street at 7.50 on a Pullman Dining Car breakfast on journey. Beautiful ride. In a rest camp at Folkstone for a few hours and after a very stormy crossing eventually arrive here, in a neat billet for the night. News of a retreat by Fritz on a 30-40 mile front is confirmed Cambrai St Quentin are objectives now. Many villages captured.
Tuesday 20
 At Abbeville en route for Amiens where we will begin to seek our units. The champagne incident. I have awakened from my dream. Many villages captured again yesterday.
Wednesday 21
 At Fricourt Farm again after coming from Amiens in motor cars. Ride from Abbeville to Amiens, 2nd class on a passenger. The unit moves back to Buire again tomorrow.
 News of the fall of Cambrai St Quentin other villages but ?
Thursday 22
 Move back with unit to Buire again. Snowing last night to-day but clear starlight nights. The above about Cambrai St Quentin is incorrect.
Friday 23
 At Buire which is still as bleak windy as ever it was. Much to my disgust I am not allowed to join "B" Section at Bazentin but am put in an officers ward. No work however.
Saturday 24
 At Buire. Beautiful day but windy. Summer time begins at midnight, meaning clocks to be put forward one hour. Spring is noticeably coming and sky larks are becoming common again the trees showing signs of bud.
