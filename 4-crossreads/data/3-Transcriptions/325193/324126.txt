<p>off.<br/>Well Mother I want you to tell Bertie that I will write to him very soon.  I am getting a very bad hand at letter writing.  Your letters are about the only ones that I do write.  Now when I first came over here I used to write to half the girls in N.Z. but I have given it up now.  You know a new broom sweeps clean.</p>
