This village was a fairly big place before the Germans started to shoot their iron factories about.  Here are some very fine buildings in this town, but they have been ruined by shell fire.
Also in this place are loop holes all over the buildings, the windows and doors are all loopeholes the cellars were used for machine guns positions, but poor fritz got chased out of them.
We had to do our share of fatigue every day and night in the line, in the way of building communication trenches and building dugout's. One day we were on fatigue building a dugout a few hundred yards behind the line, and a very exciting air dual took place, so all hands downed tool's to watch the operations.
