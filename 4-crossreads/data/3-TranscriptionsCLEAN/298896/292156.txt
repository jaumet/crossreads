  
 alongside for a landing ground & refilling point. Over 20 planes were down at once, Camel scouts, & were going & coming all day each being fitted with 4 - 25 lb bombs. The major in charge is supposed to be our leading airman with 54 to his credit. One going up during the afternoon tried to twin too soon & struck the ground with his wing & crashed, smashing up the plane. The pilot received a shaking only. Orders through tonight for us to move at 6 A.M. in the morning for Cappy. Visited Harbonnieres & saw a large cemetery containing French German & our own graves. A certain amount of satisfaction is gained by seeing so many German graves. 
 Monday 2nd Sept. Reveille 4.30. Breakfast 5 A.M. rather chilly but fine weather. Half of us moved off by charabanc bus at 6 A.M. for Cappy where we took over the M.D.S. from the 8th Fld Amb. The remainder marched & arrived shortly after 9 A.M.
