The annual festival is meant to keep in the minds of the people the value of the Nile & its yearly rising. In the old days there used to be a dam across the river & when the flood was high enough "the cutting of the Khalig" was celebrated & the dam was cut. In addition a young girl used to be thrown in the Nile as a sacrifice but for the past  30 centuries  this latter practice has been discontinued & an image of mud substituted. A great feast also takes place & there are firing of guns, decorated river boats, crowds of natives, etc.
