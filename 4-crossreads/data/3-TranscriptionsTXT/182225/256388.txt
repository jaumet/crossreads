 1916 &nbsp; TUESDAY 26 &nbsp; SEPT. 
 Fine &amp; warm. Revielle at 5.30 and we all paraded in marching order and marched over to Bulford where we joined up with the rest of the 3 rd &nbsp;Division. A lot of the artillary was mounted with their guns (18 pounders &amp; howitzers). It was a fine sight to see all the mounted artillary &amp; infantry with fixed bayonets marching past and a few aeroplanes over-head flying about. We got back to camp some time after 7 pm a very tired but happy lot. Got a letter from M  â€‹   r &nbsp;LLoyd dated 23 rd &nbsp;Aug.
