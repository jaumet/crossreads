who asked me where I was going to after the service.  I told him that I intended going back to camp (I was in uniform at the time) he then asked me wether I would care to spend the evening at his house & break my fast there.  I told him that I would be only too pleased to accept his invitation & accordingly I sat down to a real Yiddish meal (& didn't I enjoy it - raaather.  I should Shay sho).I sent a letter to Aunty soon after we left Australia asking her to tell you I had joined etc & also to tell you I was in the Transports.  My reason for asking her to tell you that was because I did not want you about me being in any danger.  As it happened I am in the Infantry but never-the-less you need not worry about me getting hurt or shot as I do of becoming a multi-millionaire within the next few minutes.  As I think I have already said we are going out here merely to relieve the regulars & act as a garrison in their place.
I had intended to make arrangements when we got to England for 30/- a week to be left you out of my pay but as we are not going to England I will make all the necessary arrangements here.  I had also hoped that when we got to England I would have about 10 to draw but but owing to there being no going to England for us I shall not have so much to draw as the trip has been cut some three weeks shorter by our landing here.  However as soon as we are once more in camp I will try & draw what is due to me & send it you.
