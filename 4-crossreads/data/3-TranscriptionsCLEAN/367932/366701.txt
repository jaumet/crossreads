 His Ex. The Commandant of Australian troops British Forces Hilopolis Cairo 
 Sir, 
 Respectfully, I beg to bring to your kindness that, I am a Christian Egyptian young-man, well acquainted with both English and Arabic Languages, and also obtained the Primary Education Certificate. 
 I heard that there are vacant posts such as interpreters and others for the British Forces.  So, Willingly I offer my-self to one of those.  I feel that my knowledge fits me for such work, although I promise to do my best to give satisfaction.  I hope that you will give your order to be appointed in any vacancy whatever it may be. 
 Should my request be granted and may you live long.  I have the honour to be, Sir, 
 Your Obedient Servant Kosta Salama 
 Will you please be so kind enough to reply me and much obliged, 
 My Address is: - Kosta Salama Abo Kebir
