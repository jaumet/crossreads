 23/5/19 London some ground everi day in tube etc . In the even went down to Soho ? a dirti quarter but like step into Franc or Itali to see the sign ?Epiceri " ?Ristoranto " etc . Had dinner at Caf d?Itali ? a veri warm close night and the place ill ventil . From here round to Leicest Sq. and then to the region round Horseferri Road a low dingi dark local full of brawl women . Tenement and drunk . And some of our men when on leav never get out of this beast quarter . Thing on the whole seem fair quiet and until about 11.30 I wander round Piccadilli ? too hot for theatr so crowd were promenad . I have seen a good mani place but for pure mercenari cold vice give me this citi of London . A hard cruel place and a hell for a man or woman without money I should think .
