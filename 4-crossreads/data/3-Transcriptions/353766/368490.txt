<p>Altered course slightly making for Pinas Bay in Columbia, just to afford the admirals the opportunity of a confabulation. Jap. R. Admiral boarded us with his staff. Very capable looking little men. Jolly good allies. One cannot help thinking that the Australian contempt has a big dash of dread in it. The admirals say goodbye. We signal message to Jap commissioned officers.   <strike>Crews</strike> Ships companies gather on decks. Comdr. Hyde calls for 3 cheers for Japs, who reply with even heartier banzais. Push off after an hour's stop. Panama tomorrow &amp; stop Jamaica. I am learning geography, I reckon. We are only 120 miles off.<br/>Dec 11. Land ahead 8 a.m. Yes, that's Panama &amp; entrance to the Canal. Shall be there now in ten minutes. Hullo! What has happened. Why, we've turned round &amp; are going back, &amp; we are not stopping. Message has come to say we cannot go thro', owing to slip in Culebra Cut. Bitter disappointment for second time in two</p>
