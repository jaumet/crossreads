 October 1916 which is now razed to the ground &amp; covered with shell holes, &amp; dead bodies are lying about everywhere.  This place was in German hands about 10 days ago &amp; signs of fighting are still fresh.  While we were cutting up a German Machine Gun Belt one of Fritz's shells came across &amp; landed about 30 yds from us, followed closely by two more.  We were showered with a heap of mud &amp; after the third one, thought it time to "git." Coming back we passed a great number of batteries who were barking furiously at Fritz, &amp; we arrived home in time for dinner.
