 Tues. Aug 22nd Under the trees we reposed there. 
 Rose at 6.30 a.m. breakfast after wich we fall in on parade & then up came three ambulance motors which we (when I say we there were I think twelve or sixteen of us mostly those who had returned from the CCS). 
 After boarding the cars under Major Brown quite a fresh officer who did'nt belong to the 6 we moved of Lord knows where all I know is we coursed East. I humerously wondered if we were going to take Berlin however we all seemed to thoroughly to enjoy the situation, at 11 a.m. we are still going and are in the vicinity of Albert but we seem to be adrift, lost & we have made several haults & retraced part of our journey & then again into Albert & among the trenches & eventually pull up on the camping areas on the edge of Albert, here, we have orders to remain & Bivouac and find out that we are to establish an intermeadite dressing station 
 This locality is full of life different units arriving & camping preparity to going into battle.
