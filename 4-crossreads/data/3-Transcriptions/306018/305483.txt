<p>Lieut Lambert [George Lambert] who is a good singer, so he &amp; Todd kept it up between them till midnight.  They had the Scamps, the English Theatrical Company, now on at the Kursaal among their audience towards the finish.<br/>On Monday night Todd went to Alexandria &amp; young Cave &amp; myself went to the Kursaal with Lieut Philip to see the "Gay Parisienne".  Philip shouted us a box.  Neither Cave nor I were financial enough to have gone otherwise.  We also had a trip to the Mousky Bazaar one afternoon.  Todd &amp; Philip both bought a quantity of stuff, including a nice coffee service for cousin Mattie.  I contented myself with 4 ash trays, 2 of which I sent to Roy &amp; 2 to Doug.</p>
