 Wednesday, 13 October, 1915 Rec more mail &amp; papers but a lot still astray. 
 During the afternoon an aeroplane a British one came down on the mud flat on the left near Suvla, it is surmised to drop a wounded passenger , and whilst on the ground the Turks put a lot of shrapnel into it they must have fired 100 shots before absolutely hitting it and putting it out of action, when their guns were firing they must have shown their position as our [indecipherable] poured big shells into them.  Wrote home to-day to Elfie my letters were dated 24 Aug. 
 Thursday, 14 October, 1915 A bit of an attack on the left yesterday but we never know the result of these attacks.  Further good news from the other fronts, Greece has declared an armed neutrality with benevolent feelings to the Allies. 
 My mate and I spent the day erecting a new bivy [bivouac] we obtained the timber and made the frame work over which we stretched waterproof sheets and it is now as a nice bivy as is in the peninsular.  We have a lamp &amp; plenty of books &amp; magazines and two stretchers for beds and as the nights are so cold we are in between the blankets at 6-30 p.m. and a nip of rum &amp; milk warms us for the night.
