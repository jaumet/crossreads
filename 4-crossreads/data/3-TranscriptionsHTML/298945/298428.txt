<p>The news continues to be good. Fritz is retreating all over the front from Rheims to the north, &amp; the Hindenburg has been reached in parts &amp; broken in one place. We are, in fact, threatening Douai, Cambrai &amp; St Quentin. Lens has fallen &amp; so has La Bassee. The only doubt that exists in my mind is whether he will be able to hold out on the remainder of the Hindenburg line: (that is whether we shall fail to outflank it); or whether he has some retreating line up his sleeve.</p>
<p>One is inclined to look a gift horse in the mouth after so many weary months of bad news. As a matter of fact, we have, without reserve, done excellently on this front, &amp; so have the French &amp; Americans in the south. The strategy appears sound, &amp; there is an excellent chance of his evacuating the Hindenburg</p>
