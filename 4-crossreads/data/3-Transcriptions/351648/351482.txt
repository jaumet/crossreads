<p>know pretty well, several of them are old University chaps of my era, at present I am in the 14th Field Ambulance &amp; am quite happy as far as that goes, you ask if I am downhearted &ndash; I don't think so.  Since joining the Army I have realised the necessity of becoming a Philosopher, &amp; of taking things as they come without kicking against the pricks (&amp;the pin pricks in military life are very many &amp; if one allows them to irritate one very annoying) so I do whatever I can &amp; trust to luck, at times I go to the trenches for a week or fortnight in charge of one advanced dressing station &amp; think I'm happier there than anywhere, for there I run my own show &amp; get rid of the feeling that had been growing in me since I joined the Army that I was <strike>not only</strike> neither useful nor ornamental but an encumbrance &amp; not worth my salt, whilst up at trenches I can feel at times that I am really some use &amp; doing something worth while.  Yes as you surmise some of the sights are indeed ghastly, its some consolation to feel that one can do something to relieve the poor beggars, I admire the Australians when wounded more than I can tell you they are the bravest things on God's earth.  As for getting hard &ndash; I don't think I am, I often think I've got something of the old woman in me, by "old woman" I mean nothing disrespectful I assure you, I count it rather an accomplishment (if that is permissible).  What nonsense your saying that you write rotten letters, all I've ever got have been anything</p>
