 Wednesday 17th  [Mar] Turned out in full dress (marching order) &amp; got a good start on at 8.30am, passed through Tura &amp; reached Halouan at 10 oclock about 10 miles from here.  We watered &amp; fed our horses not forgetting ourselves &amp; started on the road back, reaching camp at 5.30pm.  We were all pretty tired &amp; stiff.  We appreciated the hot stew the cooks had ready for us. 
 Thursday 18th We carried out further manoeuvres attacking, retiring under cover, &amp; put in fairly good work.  Fire discipline drill in the afternoon.  We were turned out of our big tent &amp; put into a smaller on the other side of the horse lines, the larger tents being required for Red Cross purposes.  Was on picket at night.  Drew middle shift.
