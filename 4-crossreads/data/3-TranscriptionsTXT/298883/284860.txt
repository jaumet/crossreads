Mess tonight in the old style, though the welcome was a dry one, which was just as well perhaps.
25thThe 53rd Bn. held their Bn. Sports today.
Our boys still on strike.
26thThis morning I watched the boys of the 54th that is the strikers as they might be termed hold a battalion parade under the command of a full blown private and they behaved splendidly.  Bde sports were held this  evening afternoon and went off O.K.  I was assistant starter and bawler out until my throat got sore when the Major Lucas took on the job.  A n despatch came along about 5.30 p.m.
