Friday 28 April 1916Leo's birthday & a continuation of the glorious spring weather. The day was clear & fine, quite warm in the sun, & the evening really delightful. The sunset scene with the sandhills in the foreground between us & the estuary, & the very calm Channel with a fleet of sailing vessels fishing across the outside of the bar, the whole screened against a pretty evening sky, made one long to be able to paint. The twilight noticeably lengthening, it being fairly light until 1/4 past 8.During the morning had the company out on the estuary flat doing work in anticipation of Sunday's reinspection. An officers' lecture & company matters occupied the afternoon.
