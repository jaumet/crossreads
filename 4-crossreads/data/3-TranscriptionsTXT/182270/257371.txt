 FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; Sunny. Had early breakfast 
 and marched out of Sutton Veny at 
 8 AM. Got a special train from 
 Warminster at 9.30 and came 
 right alongside the &quot;Anchises&quot; 
 at Devonport at 2.30. Got a good 
 two berth cabin &amp; with any luck 
 will keep it to myself the whole 
 way over. My word its different 
 from the trip over.
