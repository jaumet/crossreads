<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   On Leave<br/>I wanter go back to the trenches;<br/>I wanter go back to the front!<br/>I wanter go back to me rifle an' pack,<br/>An' 'ear me old straps creak and grunt:<br/>I wanter get back to me blanket,<br/>An' sleep on me old little plank.<br/>'Cos the cold, clammy sheets that the folks thinks is treats<br/>Make me shiver like rats in a tank</p>
<p>I wanter get back from the war news,<br/>I wanter get back to the Hun:<br/>I wanter retreat from the chaps in the street<br/>'Oo know 'ow the war should be run:<br/>I wanter go where "Tipperary"<br/>Ain't whistled from morning 'till night:<br/>I wanter go back where the Zepps don't attack<br/>'Cos there ain't any babies to fight.</p>
<p>I wanter get back from the flappers<br/>'Oo rattle their boxes an' flags:<br/>I wanter vamoose from the blooming revues<br/>An' the wearisome singin' of "rags"<br/>I wanter get back from the motors<br/>An miners with strikes on the brain.<br/>I'm muddled to think, an' I shan't sleep a wink<br/>Till I'm safe back in Flanders again.</p>
