<p>3<br/>Copy.<br/>He took part in the Bayonet attack the Brigade made on the night of May 15th, his Company moving up in support just after daylight on 16th. I did not personally see anything of his work on this occasion, but was constantly hearing about him from his Company Commander, Lieutenant Derviche-Jones, who spoke very highly of him.</p>
<p>The action in which he was killed was roughly this:-<br/>The Brigade was ordered to attack in 4 small columns, covered on the left by a column of another Brigade.</p>
<p>The whole attack depended on the left column succeeding in taking Ferme de Bois. The attack was launched, and our people and the Staffords made good progress, A &amp; B Coys. getting right up to their objective Ferm Cour d'Avoue closely supported by half B Coy under Rich. Unfortunately, the left Column failed to take Farm de Bois, chiefly owing to our own Artillery falling short, and killing and wounding nearly all the Officers.</p>
<p>The Staffords came under an intensely hot machine gun fire from their flank and had to fall back. D Coy. had to do the same, and passed word to A &amp; B Coys. Rich worked with the utmost coolness and gallantry, covering the retirement of the Coys. in front, keeping his men well</p>
