<p>It was also in this camp where we spent our Xmas &amp; considering the circs we had a very decent time. Boxing morning the 26th was detailed in charge of a fatigue party &amp; went up to Wytschaete village on road making. Next day I went with an officer &amp; N.C.Os &amp; had a good look round the Front line, Supports &amp; reserve trench which was to be our home for a few days. On the 30th I came a big thud for I was detailed as platoon advance guard &amp; had to go to the front line &amp; have a look at platoon sector &amp; also went out on patrol &amp; next morning came back to Wytschaete village &amp; made a big fire &amp; thawed myself. I met my platoon that same night &amp; guided them into the front line &amp; took over. Our position here was on the outpost scheme with piquet line, supports, reserves etc &amp; no movement whatever could be made whatever. On the night of the  1st January I was detailed in charge of wiring party in no man land &amp; did a few hours work. Next night the 2nd we changed over &amp; we moved back to support where we had to do fatigue etc &amp; we lasted there for three days. We again moved &amp; changed over with the front line on the night of the 5th.</p>
