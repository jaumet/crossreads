  
 an invitation to lunch with them -did so & one of his sisters snapped the wild Australian "being a souvenir hunter". The operation last Tuesday, entire success. At present am confined to my couch, but I am glad to say, not for long, the lure of Piccadilly is on me & I must away. Grand village this London, old girl, have enjoyed every minute of my stay here, it fascinates me, the people millions of them, traffic theatres & last but not least the rosy cheeked fair sex who treat us chaps fine. Well my dear sister enough for this sitting or I will bore you, so love to your sweet self R & B from Ken am glad you liked the photos.
