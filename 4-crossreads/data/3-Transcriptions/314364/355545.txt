<p>Sunday Feb 9.<br/>The weather is quite cold &amp; the wind blowing almost a hurricane. The ship is rolling &amp; many of the Diggers are suffering from "Mal de Mer" already.<br/>The food is fairly good and plentiful. Our Deck (D) seems to be about the most comfortable on the Boat.<br/>Mon. Feb. 10.<br/>Most of the A.M.C. Staff are sick, &amp; we have a number of Patients in Hospital with Influenza &amp; prostration from Sea Sickness.  The weather continues rough &amp; there are many vacant seats at meal times. I manage<br/>to put in an appearance at every meal. I don't feel particularly brilliant. I'm not exactly <u>sick</u>  but I do a lot of swallowing. The Hammocks are more comfortable than Bunks this rough weather. Big seas  are coming aboard &amp; all the Troop Decks but ours are awash.<br/>I'm going on night Duty tonight with "the Yank" as all the other fellows are too sick. The [indecipherable] Latrines were smashed in today &amp; the cook house washed out by big waves.<br/>Things are only "muddling"</p>
