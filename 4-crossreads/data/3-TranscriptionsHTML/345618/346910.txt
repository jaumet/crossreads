<p>You at your age will feel the cold<br/>It's trying too, when you are old,<br/>To have your movements all controlled<br/>By Tom or Dick<br/>And have to do just what you're told,<br/>And do it quick.</p>
<p>In summer you will find the heat<br/>Terrific &ndash; when with blistered feet<br/>And choked with dust, and all but beat<br/>You have to march<br/>In shifting sand &ndash; not Regent Street<br/>Or Marble Arch.<br/>The flies too are a perfect pest<br/>That all your food &amp; drink infest.<br/>You swallow Johnny Walker's best<br/>To cool your throttle &ndash;<br/>And feel a buzzing in your chest &ndash;<br/>A d-d blue bottle.</p>
