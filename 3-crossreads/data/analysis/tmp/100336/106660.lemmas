 Dure this time we are lie close to the Asiatic shore , so that anyth pass would go well clear of us . About an hour after we start to charg our batteri a ship was seen come toward us from the direct of Chanak . She was show all light . At first we thought it advis to stop our engin as a thick heavi smoke was lie all along the water . Howev the ship was pass well clear of us and we did not stop our engin . Soon after this three small launch were seen approach us from Gallipoli . They were probabl small torpedo boat . This time we stop engin and they pass without see us . At 3.30 we stop our engin have had a fair good charg . We then prepar to dive to enter the Sea of Mormora . ( Dure the time we had been lie on the surfac a light rain was fall .
