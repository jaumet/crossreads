<p>Some photos I had taken here are finished &amp; I am waiting for pay day to send them on. We expect to get a final week-end in Melbourne &ndash; Sat &amp; Sunday next - &amp; I don't want to be broke then &ndash; so am not taking delivery of the photos for a few days. They &ndash; the photos -  are not up to much anyhow.<br/>If this week-end suggestion comes off I, for one, will be lucky as it will mean only two days messing about here this week &amp; then freedom until Monday morning. Then on Monday week we are supposed to sail, so there wont be very much doing from now onwards.<br/>Just now I can think of nothing to write about, so will go round somewhere out of sight of Hd Quarters &amp; have a snooze in the sun. It's an A.1 day for a sun bathe.<br/>With love to all &amp; plenty for your self from yr Harry</p>
<p>If you have one of the photos to spare, you might send (one of the best) to Lois P. or perhaps she may get it while in Sydney.</p>
