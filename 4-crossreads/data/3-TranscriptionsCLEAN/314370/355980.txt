  
 February, 1916 Friday 11 Work all day priming the class up ready for their first exam.  Most of them are in a mortal funk. Weather cold & damp. 
 Saturday 12 Description Exam takes up all morning, but I am disappointed at my class, they did not do well at all, but had a hard examiner & used some hard words on him, but better luck next time. Our Colonel returns from his holiday & everybody glad to see him back
