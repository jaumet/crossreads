<p>It is wonderful the amount of work the old peasant women do &ndash; far more than the younger ones. One never sees a man, except the aged and infirm.</p>
<p>Their conditions of life seem to agree with them. They certainly would not with us. Apparently you take a courtyard, into it, for the rest of your life and your children after you, you heap manure, old straw, hens, pigs, slops, rags, tins etc. Then you proceed to build round it &ndash; on one side the domicile &ndash; the remaining sides Barns, Pigstyes, Stables etc. No, I do not think the Public Health Officer would pass it!</p>
<p>I saw Jim Simpson for a few minutes the other day in A - . Married life seems to agree with him and he was very fit and well. He has just been through a Senior Officers Course in England, and may get a Battalion any day.</p>
<p>It is splendid what the old original 4th Officers have done. We now have one Brigadier &ndash; 5 Lt. Cols. &ndash; a Divisional Base C.O.</p>
