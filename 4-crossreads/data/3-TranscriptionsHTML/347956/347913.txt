<p>8.3.15</p>
<p>Mon 8th<br/>Paraded sick again this morning &amp; my sickness was named Diptheria by the old quack.  I do not think he knows enough to be able to tell what it is, but the tent I camp in had to be pulled down &amp; disinfected this morning<br/>I hope none of the others catch dip. although I do not feel too bad myself &amp; am enjoying a good holiday on the strength of it &amp; I am satisfied to let it go as diphtheria until I get proof that it is not.  The troops were out for musketry to-day &amp; when they returned Crook, who has the same complaint as myself, went to the Sergeant Major &amp;</p>
