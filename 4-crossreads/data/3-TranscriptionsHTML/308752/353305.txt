<p>from the shore &amp; no one is allowed to leave the boat.</p>
<p>Saturday 11th December.<br/>After four days at anchor we are at least tied up to the wharf Suez does not impress me very much it is a filthy hole of a place   We had great fun with the natives had them diving for coins in the harbour.  They are really wonderful in the water, All the sick have been landed, we had a detachment of Indian Stretcher Bearers helping us.  12 a.m. The first train load has just left with A &amp; B companies of the 30th Batt. We entrain at 4 p.m. The carriages are like cattle trucks, of course the officers travel 1st class.  Poor humble privates 3rd class.  We travel 3rd because there is no 4th. The train journey was very interesting we passed right through Suez.   Here the train was rushed by crowds of natives etc- who try to take every one down, I always offer them half the amount they ask for then you are sure of getting your moneys worth. They seem to be a filthy race very few of them have been known to touch water, the smell of them is enough to knock one over. The Canal could be seen quite close to the train,  never imagined that it was so narrow. All through the night at every station we were rushed by the natives, sleep was impossible, the row they kicked up was terrific. Some of our chaps bought cigarettes off them but you can imagine their wrath on discovering that they consisted of tobacco at both ends &amp; saw dust &amp; any other rubbish in the middle.  Of course any fruit we buy off them, has to be thoroughly</p>
