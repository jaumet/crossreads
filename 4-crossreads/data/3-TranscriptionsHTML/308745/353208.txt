<p>[Letter on Bellevue Hotel, San Francisco notepaper, possibly from Brian Pockley's younger sister Helen, to him from a ship on west coast of USA]<br/>My dear Brian<br/>My pretty little brother<br/>You see you have another<br/>Lovely letter mister<br/>From your sweet young sister</p>
<p>I hope that you're all thriving<br/>And that you're not driving Your poor old self too hard<br/>(I was born a bard)</p>
<p>We are all well now, though<br/>Kindly don't ask how so<br/>Matters with poor Helen<br/>When the ship is sailin'.</p>
<p>We can't reach Vancouver<br/>Though she's a quick mover<br/>Until early on the 4th<br/>Much to poor Pockley's wrath.</p>
<p>She was a day late leaving<br/>Because these cracked coal-heaver [?]<br/>Rascals in Australia<br/>Made her plans a failure.</p>
