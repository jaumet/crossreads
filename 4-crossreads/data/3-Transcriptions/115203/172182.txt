<p>it was too late to put down what happened last night so I&nbsp;add it to todays notes about 8.30 last night the turks exploded a mine between 7. &amp; 16 Post killing and burying 26 of the boys had they sapped the mine a little further my mates and myself would have suffered to I spent this day helping to dig out the men but Alas not one was alive to add to this trouble another chap of the 19th lost his life through a faulty sandbag the bullet piercing his heart as he stood with his back to it, you never can tell what a sandbag is like on the outside this one was compleately worn away and lost its resisting power, it has put the Batt in the mumps but we will get even for that bet your life we have their first and second line of defence well mined and our Engineers are only waiting to get a good muster of turks when they will send her up.&nbsp;(this mine was sent up on Oct 11th I was not then there but I heard it was a great suceess) A spy has been caught in one of the Gullies. Short time he will get, three turks crept over to our tenches last night some of the boys say they wanted</p>
