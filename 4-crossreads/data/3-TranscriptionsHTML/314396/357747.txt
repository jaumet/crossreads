Told me to wash in salt water &amp;  gave me some zinc ointment.<br/>Sydney &amp;  Empress of Russia passed this morning about &frac14; to 6. Passed a big school of porpoises &amp;  a lot of  birds hovering around   some long fish like eels, which were close to the top of the water. Saw plenty of catamarans. Funny looking boats they are. They are very narrow but deep. Should think about 2' or 1'6" wide &amp;  on one side they have 2 outriggers (bent pieces of wood with longer pieces floating in the water), for balancing the boat. They may have 2 masts on this is fastened a square</p>
