IIII am hoping that possibly I may see Les here before I return. Struan Robertson is here and has told me they expect their 8th Reinforcements which Les is in, at any time. Struan has certainly had a wonderful run of luck. His Brigade (the 4th) seemed to have the hardest time of any of our people on the Peninsula and he has come through it all with only two slight wounds.Have not seen many fellows whom I know here - Charlie Lecky is here and still going strong - was very pleased to meet my old Sergeant from my section in the D.A.C. on the Peninsula just before I left. He now has his commission and is in the 6th Battery. Father may remember him in Sydney - his name is A.O. McMullen - comes from Scone where he is in the grazing line.
