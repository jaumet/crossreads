 Paris 6/3/17 the Opera House and changed some English money into French and then across to a box office and got a ticket for Rigolletto on Thursday night.  The Boulevards all round here crowded with a gay and highly fashionable throng.  Officers gay in medals and ribbons and soldiers of all varieties and nations with ladies in tow.  Great traffic of taxis tearing round.  Back to hotel at 2.30.  Wrote some letters and read and at about 6.30 went round to Restaurant Italien off the Boulevard Italiens for dinner.  Had Spaghetti, and snails the later required a little courage to master their ground flavour.  Served with little tongs to hold the shell and a small fork to extract the snail.  On the menu under heading of "fish".  Finished off with Caneravallo [?] cheese and a demi of Bordeaux rouge (should have been Chianti!). 
 From here tried to walk to Montparnasse but got lost and had to get a cocher to drive me.  An awful dead and alive hole &ndash; nothing doing.  The Moulin Rouge like some gaunt skeleton.  returned via Metro (underground) same smell as London.  Good trains.  To Opera &amp; walked home having a Bock at a cafe en route.  Women here are marvellous in their dress and looks and use subtle intoxicating scents that permeate all round them.
