<p>contd. from page 90.</p>
<p>I have just had two enjoyable days in Cairo.  A large cool room &amp; soft white bed &ndash; slept 12 hours on end.  Collected your letter June 15th &ndash; which also did me good.  The enclosure from the Leeds people I answered merely stating I was much interested but felt that they would have decided before my return to England also the money would have to be &pound;350 to &pound;400.  Re Carnegie Institute &ndash; Have received no papers just your mention &amp; hopes that I send Important People.  Send 'Important people' or if time write them that I am sending it.  I'm quite uncertain as to sending in date.</p>
<p>I am applying for transport to England <strike>on</strike> to take effect on or about 28th July so that it is just a question of sitting tight (not boosed) for a few days or few hours &amp; then you &amp; I for a holiday.</p>
