 Going  Port Said  to look for Kit- as do not want  to go Desert  without Certain Articles. Expect our Regiment to go to Al Arish &amp; have a fight there  I may spend Xmas day there!  Sorry if my greetings to you all at home are late still you know I never forget you- Published soldier's letter in Walgett Paper from local Parson "Re Red X work- "I notice a lot of Pyjamas" made by the dear ladies of Walgett, which make "me feel in touch with you all!!! Note all Joe says about coming   I can't see how he  could be doing his bit  more than where he is- but I understand.
