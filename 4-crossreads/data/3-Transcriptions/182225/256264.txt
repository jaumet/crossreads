<p>MAY&nbsp;&nbsp; FRIDAY 26&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Very cold again &amp; windy&nbsp; I would give anything to get a bit of sun again&nbsp; I have missed it more than anything. I was on parade for the first time today for a bit, but was too weak to do much. There was to be a concert in the evening given by the Queenslanders but it was too cold &amp; wet to give it.</p>
