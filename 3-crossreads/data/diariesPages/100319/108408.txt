Let Matthews take church parade while I remained in. after lunch rode to Flessells a lovely ride. The country round here exquisitely green. No, Australia can produce nothing to equal France in autumn! But winter -- ??! Passed the old Chateau ? the Marquis is in Midi. Rode up to Rue du Chateau and the door was opened by Georgette now 17 and a changed kid. Not a bad looking little mademoiselle
