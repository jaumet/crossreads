At Sea
24/3/16
At 0800 passed an island with fairly high peaks. A big hospital ship on the starboard about 4 miles and a horse boat on the left. Expect to make Marseilles before dark tomorrow night but some doubt owing to devious course we steer. A heavy ground swell running this morning. Two sailing ships on the portside looking beautiful with every stitch of canvas spread in the gentle breeze. About lunch time came abreast of SARDINIA, a rough country, and ran up the coast several large rocks isolated with waves dashing up them and little patches of cultivation. 
CORSIA followed, very similar in appearance higher peaks in rear spoke of inland ranges. All over the hillsides vivid white patches which are houses of the square blankwall Eastern type and apparently whitewashed. We have some characters Skeene Smith Jock Munro are not the least of them. "No 11 platurn" and the unfortunate "Pukkis" (Purkis").
Checked kit again today a thing we never appear to get much forward with. Had a game of drawpoker before lunch won. Very pleasant in the sun today but the constant ground swell is rather upsetting. In this part of the Mediterranean we are encountering more sailing vessels than we have seen up to date. The two islands are very long and we have been abreast of them all day after dark played poker before dinner with five others. Colbran (the nuisance) wants a transfer. Shall be glad to get on shore and handle the company, it to hard on board ship.
