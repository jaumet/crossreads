untill 4.20 & were told to make our dugouts  - in the side of the R-way cutting. Just got a start on them & were stopped as a better place had been found. It was evidently where our chaps dug in the first night of the advance  Morrison & I got a bit of trench about 10 feet long & 1 foot wide cleaned it up & lengthened it a bit & covered it with iron Passed through 2 little villages today all battened up & a railway dump where the Hun has left a lot of stuff. Saw 3 of our planes down also a damaged tank.
