<p>Left me weak. Burton no better. Left for Mal-de-maison in afternoon.</p>
<p>Friday, 25.<br/>Did not stir from tent all day. Tried to write, but not feeling good enough. Slept most of time. By the way, the blankets are as lousy as they possibly can be.</p>
<p>Saturday, 26.<br/>Feeling a little better, but had to remain in tent all day.</p>
<p>Sunday, 27.<br/>Feeling better---so doctor marked me TGO. Not enough cars to take us all to Albert---so went to roadway for lorries. By this time I was feeling off colour again. Got in somehow to Albert---walking lorries etc---by 8.pm. Had tea, and slept, another fellow and I in an empty house in Albert.</p>
<p>Monday, 28.<br/>Got a few biscuits and some coffee for breakfast. Thence camp The other chapp was very decent and helped me with my things right to our camp and then went back to join his battalion. Everyone thought I had gone to Blighty. Lay down most of day, but stayed in lines as long as I was able. Nerves not too good on going to bed.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 29.<br/>Up at reveill&eacute;. Saw doctor next day, but he was too busy to go into my case---gave me bromide pills. Saw a couple of fellows there who had been out in No-Man's-Land for seven days. The clothes (cut off them) were covered in blood and maggots. Stayed up for a while but had to lie down and rest. Mud everywhere.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 30.<br/>Wet, wet, wet. The W.O. would not allow me to attempt to work Rested all day.</p>
<p>Thursday, 31.<br/>Up at reveill&eacute; and carried on as of old-but had to peg down</p>
