Feb. 9th (Sunday)
Letters Home.  London in Winter.  An afternoon of exercise and amusement.  Walk to Parliament in the Fields, which lies adjacent to Hampstead Heath - and there I witnessing the delightful recreation of tobogganing for the first time.
Great sport.  Many laughs!  Return to Elm Bank and spend the evening reading aloud to Mr & Mrs Scales.
