<p>The Brimstone Butterfly<br/>(Gonepteryx rhamni)</p>
<p>One of the earliest to appear in Spring and remains till late Autumn<br/>Common especially in S of England. Its green caterpillar feeds on buckthorn</p>
<p>This is the Butterfly par excellence ie the Butter coloured fly, for it has lately been suggested that this is the deviation of the word, a far more probable supposition than that the word means "the fly that appears in the butter season" as some of the earlier entomologists conjectured.</p>
