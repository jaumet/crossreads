<p>Monday 3 July 1916<br/>Rather dull in the morning but a lovely day, inclined to be warm. In the morning walked up to the Divisional Baths &amp; enjoyed a good steaming in a hot bath followed by a cold shower &amp; change of underclothing. This system is undoubtedly a splendid one &amp; gives the men who come out of the line one of the greatest possible treats.<br/>Got word that we were to move back at night &amp; had to get gear together in the afternoon &amp; then tried to get a little sleep. An officer from the relieving battalions came along &amp; a good deal of time was taken with him. The company taking over moved in after dark &amp; about 11 o'clock we started to march out : just as the advance party was moving thro' the village several shrapnel shells were sent over, but no damage done to our company. There was some drizzling rain as we marched up past Sailly to our new billet, a pretty stiff march for us, out of practice as we were. We were by no means sorry to get in by about 3 o'clock.</p>
