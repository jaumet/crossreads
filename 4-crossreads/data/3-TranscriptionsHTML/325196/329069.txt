Met Morgan at tea time &amp; then went to the pictures &amp; returned to camp about 10 oclock.I guess the Colonel would not have taken me for one of the Ki-wi Reg if he had seen me as I had on a pair of slacks, dirty boots, the same tunic I took to Gallipoli minus one or two buttons, &amp; an old hat that has seen a good deal of rough usage on the Peninsula, still I had a very good day &amp; arrived back in camp with no one the wiser for my absence</p>
