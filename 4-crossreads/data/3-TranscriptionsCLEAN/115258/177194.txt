had specticles and a pointed beard of cotton wool dipped in iodine and stuck on with ointment. i was policeman, and wore a big blue over coat and a tommy helmet, with a sock stuffed with rags for a life preserver.  It was my duty to arrest the sister and after duly warning her, I asked her if she come 'aisy' or "ward I  have to use me shellalai". However she was quite contented to com 'aisy' but I had fearful trouble to keep order in the court - everybody wanted to laugh so much. There has been no mail in here fpr some time now. I have a few photos of Assuan to send home as soon as I get out of here. I was thinking of writing you an account of our trip from Luxor on; but I guess you had quite enough in the Luxor story - so I'll bring a guide book home to go with the photos, and wont worry about writing it all up. I do hope you have had good rain ere this. There is no news to tell you Mother, but with any luck I ought to be pretty close up behind this letter, so I'll let it go as it is. Love to Father and the boys. I am
Your loving Son Robert C Wilson
