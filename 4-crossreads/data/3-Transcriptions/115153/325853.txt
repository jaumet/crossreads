<p>it was to last, so we brought all the contents of the parcels we received in the mail. After we trudged a mile or two along the road, we came to a motor transport depot, where we obtained some boiling water with which we made tea, and ate some of the luxuries from our parcels. When we had finished this good meal we set on our journey again until we came to a village named Puchvilliers, and in this village we had another good meal which consisted on champagne and lobsters. <br/>It was a little after midday when we finished this meal, so we decided to have a few hours in the village despite the fact that we were very tired. We went into a few more wine establishments, and needless to say, we did not feel disposed to continue our journey to Contay, but as good fortune came our way we had a ride in a motor lorry which put us on a couple of miles further on our journey. <br/>Continuing our walk after getting out of the lorry we came across some French children skating on the ice. After having so much Champagne a few hours before, we felt like children ourselves and joined in with the skating, with the result that, before we had been at it very long one of my mates fell very heavily on his face, causing a deep gash on his cheek. There was an army hospital near, and we had our mate attended to, after which we proceeded again on our journey and arrived at Contay, our destination, at about 10 0'clock that night.<br/>We had difficulty in finding our Officer to whom we were to report, but found him eventually, and he directed us to our billet. The next morning when we turned out to roll call, we learnt that we were there for the purpose of unloading shells from railway trucks, and sorting them in great canvas covered sheds, and at times to load motor lorries from these sheds.</p>
<p>Sometimes as many as 200 lorries would come down from the firing line in one batch to be loaded. With the aid of the two motor drivers on each lorry, and our party of about 30 men, we would despatch them all in, sometimes less than 4 hours. The life in the village other than our work was very good considering the circumstances, and we used to buy some good food from the neighbouring stores. We used to sleep in a barn which had plenty of hay straw stored in it, and we made good use of the hay; and as far as sleeping was concerned, it was alright providing the boys were not intoxicated and left their mates alone who were asleep.</p>
