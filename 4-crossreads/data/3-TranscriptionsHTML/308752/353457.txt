<p>2nd June 1917. to the 15th June 1917.<br/>Training a little more severe, 2 route marches a week in full marching orders. On the 12th inst. we must have done 11 miles before dinner &amp; rather a hot day too. The weather had been delightful, the evening very pleasant, now &amp; again a thunder storm has sprung up &amp; cleared the air etc. At last rumours have proved true &amp; tomorrow we move off for  ---   not far from here. Everyone is pleased at the idea, this camp became very monotonous. Lately we have had a number of cricket matches against different Units, now &amp; again we have a win. It is worth while mentioning that on that last route march we passed through the villages that I was in last March during the advance. Eric evacuated today to Casualty clearing station with suspected Appendicitis.</p>
