<p>So far as I can find out the only damage done was four horses killed &amp; five or six men wounded.</p>
<p>Jan. 4th<br/>The weather nowadays can be only described as positively fiendish.  Last night I was on picket;  from 10 to midnight &ndash; my first shift the moon was shining amidst light feathery clouds looking most hopeful.  At 4.30 a.m., when I next resumed it was pitch black &amp; raining in a steady downpour.  Most depressing.<br/>The wadi is now running pretty freely between us &amp; El Arish.  Another stunt is hatching &ndash; originally for tomorrow &ndash; but I believe there has been a train accident &amp; our rations &amp; fodder have I believe come to grief owing to the railway bank having slipped somewhere so I don't think we shall go out tomorrow.</p>
