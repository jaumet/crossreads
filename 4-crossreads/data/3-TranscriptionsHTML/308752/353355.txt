<p>July 29th 1916.<br/>Both the British &amp; German Artillery have been exchanging compliments all day. Shells have been flying over our home by the score. Of course they are bursting a good distance from us &amp; everything is O.K. The village in the rear of us is in flames, it is probably a mass of ruins now. The German Artillery have been shelling the country around us all day. At midnight another chap Tom Ross &amp; I were called out to take a wounded man to the road where a motor ambulance will convey him to our Hospital.  The distance we carried was about a mile &amp; a half, it was very exciting at times proceeding along the Sap, with bullets whizzing over our heads, very often we had to crouch down &amp; run like hares, when we came across a portion of the Sap which was broken down. Very glad when we arrived back at our dug-out.</p>
<p>July 30th.<br/>7 p.m. A couple of shells have just burst about 20 yards from our dug-out too close to be pleasant. We all made a rush for our little home like rabbits into a burrow.<br/>8 p.m. Our first serious case just been brought in from the firing line. The doctor attended to the patient &amp; Tom Ross &amp; I carried the poor chap to the road. I received a great surprise, I met an old school mate of mine, named Marsden. On our way back I came across Carl Gow, wonders will never cease.</p>
<p>July 31st &amp; August 1st.<br/>Nothing startling, two very quiet days, called out at midnight to carry a patient to the road. Very tedious job, as bullets were often whizzing over our heads.</p>
<p>August 2nd.<br/>A competition held today on ourselves game hunting, unfortunately I came out on top had a good catch. Australian Artillery bombarding the vicinity of the Germans all the afternoon. The noise is deafening. A great number of British Aeroplanes manoeuvreing round all day. A grand sight watching some of the airmen, who are very daring, looping the loop</p>
