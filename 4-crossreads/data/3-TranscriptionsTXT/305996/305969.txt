 Wednesday. 29/3/16. Arrived at Marseilles to-day. Left Alex. last Thursday night. Had been at Serapeum and Tel-el-Kebir prior to that. When we went to Serapeum I had ingrowing toe-nails and had to go to hospital and have [indecipherable] plucked out. Nails have not yet grown. Rejoined the batt on the Saturday afternoon 4 days prior to moving for Alex. Vic B. got his commission just before we left Serapeum. I have got one stripe up and am getting two. Got the first one at Tel-el-Kebir and was informed about the other a few days ago. The second one has not yet been gazetted.
