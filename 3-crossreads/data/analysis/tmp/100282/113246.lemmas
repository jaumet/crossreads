 hope I am not too bad for we have a 6 mile march on the other side befor we get to our Camp . Jock Cocki have just come back from see about their whiski , there go to be a row over it I think , it appear they told the offic that if he did not give them back their whiski , they would not go aboard the ship , the offic said he had given the whiski to the Major , that their conduct was practic mutini he did not know whether the ship would sail or not tonight certain not with Jock true enough itjust as we were get aboard old Jock was order to go over see the Embarkat Officer he put him under arrest the last we saw of Jock was be march off to the clink between 2 Sgts . Jock wave his hand to us , Curran Revell want to go with Jock for they were equal guilti but the Officer would n't listen to them so that how the matter stand for the present , I am sorri for Jock
