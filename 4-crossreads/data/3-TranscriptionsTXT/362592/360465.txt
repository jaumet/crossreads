.... I saw Captain Ferguson down the road the other day.  I think he is a son of the Judge.  It was early morning and he was coming out of the trenches.  The night before his Company had a perfect Hell of a time.  They were attacked at dusk, and I never saw such a deluge of shell as rained on their locality.  It was just one long rumble, so much so that one couldn't distinguish the burst of one single shell, but just a continual rumble.  He looked very tired and worn out, but was lucky to be alive, if you could only have seen what was slung at them. ....

.... My Company had a bit of a scrap the other night, which I fortunately managed to pull through with a practically whole skin and a little bumping.  Two of my officers were killed and the other two wounded, but the casualties on the whole were not so heavy as I feared, and no ground was lost.  The General was rather pleased with the way things went. ....
