<p>I was there for some of it.  We have only had 2 falls of snow since coming here, and we had snow fights, like the baby with a new toy, we were not satisfied till we did.  I have seen part of London, and had a look at St. Pauls Cathedral.  We had a heavy fog every night, and 2 air raids.  They are good things to be away from.  They make the women &amp; children very frightened.  I have to get all my things packed and my equipment cleaned so I can only write a few lines to you so I hope you will excuse only the 2 pages, but duty calls and must be done.  Things over here such as meat, bacon, cheese, sugar &amp; Margarine &amp; Butter are very scarce.  Eggs 4d. ea., Bananas 6d. ea., Grapes 3/6 to 7/6 lb, Apples 4d. ea., and sweets are almost unprocurable, Chocolates 4/- lb.  This will give you an Idea of the shortage.  The country is better off than the city, so England is a good place to be out of just at present.  We soldiers are better off than the public as we are certain of getting our rations of meat &amp; sugar and the Public are not.  Ask Mary to let you have a look at the Post Cards I have sent her.  They are views of Sutton Veny &amp; Warminster.  These are pretty villages and I have been through &amp; in both.  Give my kind regards to all at Elcho.  I hope you are all well.  No more time or news now so I will close with best wishes for a prosperous New Year, and hopes of seeing you before 1918 has passed.</p>
