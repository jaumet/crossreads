<p>roof has been erected in the inside about half way up.  The London Rifle Brigade are occupying the trenches at present but Australians will be taking over in a day or two.

<p>Last night we learnt that other creatures occupy the building besides troops.  The place is alive with rats quite the size of a cat.  Whilst lying awake several ran over me.
