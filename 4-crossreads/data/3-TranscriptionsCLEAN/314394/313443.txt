  
 July 24th (continued) Teesta visited the Berrima and had mess with the Military Officers on board. The night was spent at anchor in the harbour. 
 July 25th We are in doubt as to whether we are to go by rail to Cairo or through the Canal. 
 July 26th Disembarked at Suez and left for Cairo by rail. There are three classes on the Egyptian state railways, the 3rd class is used exclusively by the natives. Our rout lies through the desert with occasional oases at which the Stations are built. Stations show signs of European workmanship although they are very small and alive with natives selling all kinds of tropical fruit. Made a half way at a place called Zigazag at which we all hoped to get drinks as it was very hot. The train being late we are unable to get drinks and anyhow are informed that the canteen had been closed owing to some of the soldiers who had already passed through playing up. We were all very amused at the natives who tried to sell us grapes, melons and etc-. The native police tried their best to keep them off with big sticks but no sooner was the policemans back turned than they were at it again. The young natives who are nearly nude are first rate beggars and call out Backshies" as they run along by the side of the train which passes by the edge of the road in places with no fence between. After a run of 6 hours we arrive in a very sleepy condition at Benhar ? at 11.30 a.m. and march to our camp which is about 2 1/2 miles from the Station. Our camp is nothing but desert and the dust is beastly. The remainder of the Brigade are camped nearby and also the 12th Light Horse, with some Artillery. 
 July 27th The Officers Mess is started and the catering is very unsatisfactory, and also the natives, who wait on us, are miles too slow although they keep themselves clean. The bread is a very dark colour with a peculiar flavour which nobody likes. C" Company was due for duty and we spent most of our time pitching tents. The tents are very fine and have an inner lining to make them cool, they hold 25 men. Some of the men are accommodated in huts built of match wood by the natives. Each is provided with a long table, one for each section. There is a Mahomidan cemetery near by which we are requested to keep sacred. No green is visible anywhere, nothing but sand in view. The sun is very hot indeed and so it is arranged that we parade from 6 to 9 and from 5 to 7 at night. We have a lecture or indoor parade at 11 o'clock.
