<p>there wasn't any from Sydney. Things seem very quiet this way now. Only one plane over last night.</p>
<p>Wednesday 21.8.18.<br/>Had inspection &amp; packed kits ready to move. We move to Hamel at 6pm. Relieve the 1st Pioneers of their billets. Looks as if the Divvy is going to rest for a couple of days. Wrote 3 letters &amp; read all the morning &amp; afternoon while waiting for the move.</p>
<p>Very foggy this morning. Left our camp at 6pm &amp; came to Vaux sur Somme passing through Hamel &amp; Vaire sous Corbie. Gee Hamel is knocked about some. Almost as bad as Warfusee. We are camped in a billet. Stone floor with windows as doors. The men are near a canal &amp; are under trench shelters. Lovely moonlight night. We took over from the 3rd Battalion. All the 1st Div</p>
