The idea of dugouts is to "localise the effect", and they can be made very comfortable after one becomes settled. I shall not comment on the work of the troops who just landed here except to say that the ground they capture is just about scaleable when our own men are on the top of the hills. What it must have been to them no-one who has not seen the place can believe. It seems hard to realise that they accomplished what they did. I got a pathetic letter from Macarthur. The doctors turned him down &amp; he is heartbroken poor old chap. You can sympathise with him. I wont say any more about yourself you would not believe me if I did. Well Keith seems to me you have had more than your fair share in this letter. It is a fairly rambling affair but may be of interest to you &amp; I have had a good many interruptions. Good luck &amp; don't take it to heart too much. Best of love to everyone. Yours ever C.R. Lucas The time now is  1403  which is 2.3 PM work out the system which is an excellent one.
