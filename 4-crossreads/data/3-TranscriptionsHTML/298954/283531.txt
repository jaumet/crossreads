<p>Robby offered his 100-ticket-stock at 80 below par and Christie sold me his best white topee for 2/-.</p>
<p>Tue.  2nd Oct.<br/>This morning the men over 60 and boys under 16 were taken on board the "Maru", the passengers were allowed to remain on board, the women and their husbands went over from here, Webbie also went.   We are to leave on a regular Black-Flag piratical cruise tomorrow whilst the "Maru" remains here as a base.   After the crowd had gone I found a luckless wight, very English, sitting at the entrance to our "maisonette" with his worldly goods gathered around him in cabin trunks and suit-cases.   "Hello!   What did they send you over here for" said I.</p>
<p>"Good God!   Are you English?" said he with a gasp of horror.</p>
<p>I was attired in a pair of once-white "shorts" and a haircut a la Boche and looked "just like a Cingalese" as he carefully explained.</p>
