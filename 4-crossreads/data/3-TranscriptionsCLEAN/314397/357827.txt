  
 Went to the club in the morning & in the afternoon I got a job. Had to supervise a big dugout being made here. All I did was to go down & have a look at it & then go down to the club & then go for a stroll.  Gee, I do detest these French people. All their streets are filthy. They throw potato peels & dirty water in the streets & are generally dirty. Won't be sorry to leave the country. Went to bed fairly early & read. It isn't quite as cold tonight. 
 Wednesday. 2.10.18. No board today so have to wait till Saturday. Spent the morning at the club. All one does here is to go to the club, have tea, write occasionally, read or go for a walk & after dinner play patience. Guess I'll be a case for the Doctor soon. Will be going back to Aussie in a padded cell. This place will drive one mad. 
 This town has been knocked about some by old Fritz & his eggs. Could knock it all down I
