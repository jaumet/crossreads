<p>Do you get those war Pictures from Cassell's.  I paid for 'em but I have never heard of you receiving one.</p>

<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>We have prayed for rain in this Country &amp; as one of the papers puts it, this amount that we are having is perfectly ridiculous.  Dad may remember that if it rains on the 15th July, St. Swithin's Day, we are due for 40 days of it.  Well, we are having our full forty, for we have not had 10 hours sunshine since.  We have said good-bye to two of our original Sergeants this past week &amp; Dave will be pleased to know of the return of Mark Marsh.  I will be pleased to hear all about Georgie's Birthday party.  I hope that it is a huge success &amp; as great</p>
