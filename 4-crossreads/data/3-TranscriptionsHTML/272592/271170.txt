<p>hurt talk about luck.</p>
<p>The reason for all this activity is pretty plain, there is going to be a raid by the 7th Batt. tomorrow night things are promising for a lively night.</p>
<p>Just at tea time the Captain came rushing in &amp; ordered us all to get out of the line as soon as possible for there was going to be a very heavy bombardment at 5'oclock, so out we all trooped to the 2nd line &amp; waited for it, she came alright &amp; our guns &amp; mortars crashed &amp; roared &amp; raged for full 30 minutes but the enemy contrary to expectations never replied so after the storm was past back we went.</p>
<p>The weather is holding fine &amp; the days are quite nice, I can hear the guns on the Somme real plain to-day</p>
