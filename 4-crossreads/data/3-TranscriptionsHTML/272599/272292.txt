<p>Jan. Tuesday 23 1917</p>
<p>Late on parade. Put on fatigues as punishment with &frac12; the unit. The coldest night on record. about 30 degrees of frost. Winter with a vengeance. All water etc is inches thick roads &amp; everything coated with ice. Many falls &amp; spills.<br/>We move off at 10 a.m. &amp; after a couple of halts reach Albert &amp; billet in school house facing the ruined cathedral.  The day is cloudless first of the winter, but consequently the air is the colder.  Icicles hang on the men's moustaches. I never experienced anything like it. Get hot soup at Church Army Hut. Parade with sore feet, new boots. Back to billet &amp; fire.</p>
