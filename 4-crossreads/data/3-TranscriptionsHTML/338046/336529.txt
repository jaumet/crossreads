<p>1917<br/>June<br/>the main Salisbury &ndash; Wilton road.   We had only then to walk past the Jacks (M.Ps) who of course seeing us come from Salisbury way did not suspect that we were without passes.   Bulbridge House was a place that we used to patronise, about this time, while in Wilton.   To use the English phrase "the grounds were thrown open to the troops", on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.   The house was on the outskirts of Wilton as one came in from Burcombe.   [Inserted photo titled "Bulbridge House Grounds."]  There was a croquet lawn where we had a few games and refreshments were sold under the oak trees.  "Le grand seigneur et madame" however did not fratenise with the boys, only occasionally walking around in a standoffish English way.   The grand seigneur would have looked better if he had worn long trousers instead of knickerbockers, as his legs were very spindly.
