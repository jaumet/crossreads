  
 [Continued from next page] We have just been out on deck Watching manly couples  peck At each other with a pillow Swaying with each stormy billow 
 We are glad to be at last Midst our own compatriots east Cuspidors & toothpicks banished Bossy, saggy trousers vanished. 
 We have not been asked our age Second name or hopes of marriage Haven't even had our steward Ask if seasickness is cured 
 Captain Phillips is so jolly Tales part in all youthful folly Such as cricket on the deck 
 Poor old Nelson H. Duval Pronounce it so's to rhyme with "call" Accompanied by James B. Haney Saw us off, altho' 'twas rainy. 
 Nelson H. sent P some roses In what capacity he poses Is evident in little ways He called 5 times in 7 days
