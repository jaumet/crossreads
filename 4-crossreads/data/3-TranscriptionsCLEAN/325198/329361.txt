  
 11 Sept, 1916 Ber El Abe Its really Tuesday morning  Time 3.0 am.  Im on picquet - the Gee Gees are quiet & the old Moon is streaming bright & high, the old desert looks still & sleepy with the moon light glimmering on the sand but the crickets are chirruping away merrily enough We left yesterday morning.  I thought I would never get in the saddle it was packed so high & some dopey fool had hogged the mane of my horse; indeed I heard the boys betting "He will" "He wont" often, as my fate seemed to hang in the balance, twixt the ground & the back of the horse.  The first have a camp in a Hod, it looks comfortable - The dates are ripe now.  We were very charmed at the sight of the sight of our camp, not a tree for half a mile - Nearest water half a mile, that's Booker.  However the section have a bosker little bag home right near the horse lines.  I am sitting at the door now & can see the horses at a glance.  Johno is Snoring sweetly.  Ive been stuck into No 3 section with Johno, Godber & Galaker.  Harold has been made Lance Jack & stays in my section.  It will soon be four now & then its "Stand to"  How the boys will love it  They have been spelling lately
