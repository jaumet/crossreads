 August 1915 He is in B Squadron attached to the 7th.  I had a long yarn with him.  Its OK getting in touch with some of your old cobbers again. 
 Monday 30th Was on observation in the morning.  At 1.30 pm our Squadron took over the firing line from 'A' Squadron &amp; we took 2 troops of the 12th LH with us.  I managed to get a good dug out &amp; didn't go on duty at night.  We blew in a Turkish tunnel about 8.30 pm.  Some Turks were working in it at the time.  They kept up a fairly solid rife fire for some time afterwards.  Ernie Pauls came over again. 
 Tuesday 31st Had another good rest all day.  Received a letter from mother also some papers &amp; a tin of ointment which will help to combat the chats.  Answered mother's letter.  There was a lot of shell fire to day.  The Turks  must have had a lot to spare.  Went on tunnel guard
