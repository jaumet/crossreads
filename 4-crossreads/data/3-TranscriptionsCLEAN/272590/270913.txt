As much, said I, as the fuel costs, that a fireless cooker burns. But why, she asked, when it's full of dust, is the vacuum cleaner? Why that's the same, I then explained, as a fat girl who is Lena. For quite some time I rambled on with daffodils forlorn, While alack, I turned around, and found the maid had gone. 
 War Bread Monday's bread is dark in hue. Tuesday's bread is tough to chew. Wednesday's bread is worse than coke. Thursday's bread makes papa choke. Friday's bread's like ammunition.
