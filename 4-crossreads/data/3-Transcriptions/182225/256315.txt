<p>JULY &nbsp; SATURDAY 15 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>A warm day for this part of the world, but we were glad to wear our tunics. Had some flag drill with M<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Neylan in morning. The battery went on duty in afternoon, and as I was not on&nbsp;<sub>^</sub><sup>duty</sup>&nbsp;I went down to Bournemouth with Bill Richards, Dick Capel &amp; Harry Camp in a car. We had one of the prettiest drives I have ever had. We had dinner at the &quot;Bath &amp; East Cliff&quot; hotel, &amp; came back after. My word the officers did look when we common gunners walked into their inner sanctum.</p>
<p>Poor Billy Hunter got bad news, he heard his brother Clive had been killed in France. I hope its not true. I had a letter from Linda the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;<s>first</s>â€‹&nbsp;she has written, but none from father.</p>
