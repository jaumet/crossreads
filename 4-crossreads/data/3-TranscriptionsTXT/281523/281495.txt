 Billjim After Bullecourt a private of the French Mortars was transferred to us for this reason.  In the action a German was calling out to be killed and so be put out of agony.  This chap obligingly despatched him with a clasp knife.  What they really objected to though was his cutting off the finger of a Hun officer because there was a good ring on it.  The gentleman was not quite dead.  This chap should go far in this battalion!! 
 29/7/17 Our bombardment is said to be so hot that many Huns have gone mad under it.  Late one night a half screwed lanky Billjim presented himself to the R.T.O Aveling &ndash; an English officer &ndash; with what was palpably a faked order for beer.  "Please give bearer a petrol tin of beer. Lieut. H.S.Wank." The  R.T.O said "Do you think I came down in the last shower!  Even if you did have an officer called Wank he would sign Lieut after his name and not before!" Billjim:- "Now Sir you see its this way &ndash; our officers ain't as well educated as you Tommies".  Tom:- Jack was funny last night.  He says this is Russian beer.  I says "yer mad it's French beer.  He says "It is Russian beer- it rushes through yer!!"
