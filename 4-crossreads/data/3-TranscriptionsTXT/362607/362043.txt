Dear George,This is London's Lake in Hyde Park. I went all around here one Sunday morning. Rotten Row lies to the left & runs parallel for a while. There is a swimming match held here on Xmas Day. It was November when I was there & there was no boating at that time. All the Ducks & swans etc are tame & people bring crumbs with them to feed the birds. It is great fun watching them scramble. There are several anti aircraft stations in the Park now, I saw the famous Indian General Sir Pertal Singh galloping up & down "the  Row. He is passionately fond of little children & was constantly pulling up & chatting with one or the other. He has 3 rows of Colours. Well George I've given all the news to Dad & Mum & as 'Lights out' has gone I'll have to duck into bed. Ellis is already half asleep. Give Regards to Otto & all the neighbours to Mr Frost & all at Brookvale . Also to Mrs Love & all the Club Boys. Do you still learn the Clarinet or have you given it up. Love From  Harry x
