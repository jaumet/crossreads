  
 good one, consisting of five courses. L./Col. Clayton D.S.O. acted as Chairman. Some fine speeches were made, and an enjoyable hour or two was spent. Another Fancy Dress Ball was held in the evening, and was as successful as the previous one. The two tableaus staged by Pte. Roberts were much appreciated. 
 "Billie Hughes" visited the Division on Sunday the 18th February, a parade was held of all Units in the vicinity, at the Square at Solre le Chateau. The 8th Brigade Band were present, and also a number of French Soldiers. "Billie" spoke for three-quarters of an hour, and received a good hearing. He is certainly very popular amongst the Australians. 
 The village of Sar Poteries in which the Ambulance is billeted, is rather an important little town, and our stay here was a delightful one.  It is situated about 10 miles from the Belgium border. The population at the present time is 2300. Electric light is installed through out the town, the power being generated at Beumont, which is about 18  kilos away. The place is full of estaminets, a hall was fixed up by the "Diggers" & dances were held there almost every evening.

I still carried on with the Postmans job, and my duties helped to pass away the weary & monotonous days. 
 The glorious news came to hand, on the 1st March that the next draft for Australia will leave the Unit on the 6th inst. & naturally the excitement of the troops was great. On the 4th inst. I attended a farewell dinner given by the Education Department, of the Unit, to the members of this Institution, who were on the next draft. On arriving there if found my name on the lists of "Toasts", & of course had to struggle through a speech. Some very fine addresses were given by the members, well up in the art of speech making.  The 5th of March saw the amalgamation of the 8th Field Ambulance, and the 15th Field Ambulance, so this is practically the end of the old unit. It was rather fitting to the occasion that I should be leaving the Unit, the following day, after being with it, since the formation in August 1915
