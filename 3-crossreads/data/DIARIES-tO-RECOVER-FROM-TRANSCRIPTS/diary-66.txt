For awhile Confusion reigned until everyone was shaken awake & helmets donned Mac. & self Got up straight away put our helmets on & got out to the roadside along the Canal La Lys. After 2 hours we resumed our broken sleep. We were nicely settled when once again they got us up. (We were sleeping with clothes on of course)
2 Lt. Joint fussed around & soon we were on the road again. Marched to a Theatre in Sailly. Had a Gas Lecture


[Page 15]

One corner, where was an old Church in ruins, we came under fire from M. Gun Traversing. Bulletts whissed overhead nearly all the way & buried themselves in the road all around. It was dark when we came behind the firing line about 1000 yds. From the Huns. Flares lit up the snakelike formation of 
the fatigue party = 100 or more men of all regiments. We halted at 3 paces interval & then I noticed that we formed a line from our own front line back.

C.R. Anderson
13 Browning St.
Seddon
Vic.

Struck water Camp. From "Gordon Dump" to Trenches in Petrol tins. All along we passed evidences of last night’s fray. Dead & dying every where. Stretcher bearers hurrying past with bloody stretchers & wnd. figures. Sickening horrors in the trenches Germans & our own dead uncovered. One man of ours blew himself & mate up with Mills bomb in pocket. Phosforus & stink fare use to a horrible headache & I lost all interest in the war. A’fternoon we dug shelves & with Equip on & W’proof sheets over us spent the night in fear & trembling. Shelling fierce.


[Page 44]
Sun. 23-7-’16
Scratchy Wilson wounded thru both arms. Brewer of #10 Platoon badly hit. A nip of rum at midnight very acceptable as no tea possible on a/c fire showing position. We are 700 yds from Poziers & our Enemy. Our Div. took R. side of this imp. Village & as I write the Tommies are shelling their portion preparatory to attacking it & capturing it. Bill Barbour & other Orig. #7 of Peninsula fame admit that this is much worse than ever they had on Penin. "It was Child’s play compared to this" said one. We managed to secure another w’proof sheet & O’coat which had been dumped by the other B’gade. Very acceptable.


[Page 45]
Mon. 24-7-’16
Permission granted us to make tea. This was a Godsend. Never did tea taste so good. Water & wood scarce former not too clean, but when hot the drink was Nectar & now I have an new interest in surroundings 50 yds. Over parapet there lies one of our Aeroplanes brought down by Germans. Charlie & I intend sneaking out to-night & looking her over. We did so & collected some souvenirs. Order came at midnight to prepare to move to support of our A & B Coy’s. McMahon buried 11 P.M.

Tues. 25-7-’16
1.30 a.m. we moved into Sap parallel with our own but leading directly to Fritz at Poziers. Here we stayed until noon. Much happened in that time. From 2 am – 2.30


[Page 46]
Tues. 25-7-’16
a.m. we witnessed the fiercest bombardment etc. 400 yds. away that any of us had seen. This was kept up intermittedly until dawn. With the dawn & long before arrived the wounded. 4 a.m. shortage of Ammo & Bombs reported from firing trench. Charlie & self continued carrying same from Reserve & Gordon Dump until 10 a.m. all day On the 1st trip to firing line I experienced the raw recruits experience of seeing our dead everywhere. Coming back from line to Dump we were assisting the S.B. with a hvy wounded and was in front shafts when I heard a voice with something familiar about it say "They’re making it pretty willing aren’t they?" On enquiry from our S.B.


[Page 47]
Tues. 25-7-’16
I learned that it was Keith H. of the 3rd R.A. coming back with shells for Trench Mortars I encountered him carrying a man we had indicated in the up journey who had fallen in the track. "Here Bill take hold of this ‘till I have a chat with this Bloke. This in answer to my "Hallo Keith how are you?"
For 3 mins we exchanged ? & answers. He had no mail for 3 mos. Been Transferred to #3 F.A. Only 1 sec. of S Aus in # 3 F.A. He looks well & seemed quite at Home. Notwithstanding the constant danger he was in. Introduced Charlie. Passed him a couple of times later. Last time as I carried Charlie to Red X Ambulance.


[Page 48]
Tues. 25-7-’16
10 a.m. we had to report to C Coy. Prepared to Reinforce front line. Under a very hvy bombardment we made our way to line. Gas turned on us made progress very difficult. Enemy had range of communicating trench too true used his knowledge to our disadvantage. Bombardment at Poziers worst of all at any front of line not excepting Verdun. After hanging in for a couple of hours word came thru that no counter attack coming & we were withdrawn to 2nd line Casualties all the time every shell almost. Charlie & self with 5 others buried. Saw to Charlie 1st found him breathing Cleared next man’s head & lungs


[Page 49]

Tues. 25-7-’16
& made for 3rd Found when pulled out to be almost gone. His legs broke under. By this time sufficient help with shovels in spot to dig out remainder so I retd. to Cobber Charlie with great difficulty (He weighs 14 stone) we got him over & with Cpl Fraser’s help (A boy’s scouts) succeeded in restoring him to 
Shells dropping all around. I took him out of trench because more shells dropping in than out of Trench & it was full of men. A & C Coy. occupied 100+ yds of it. Frank Sullivan & Jack Salter helped to carry Charlie to 1st Dressing stn. Where his case was diagnosed as Shell Shock. I accompanied S.B.’s of F.A. Coy.

Tues. 25-7-’16
Here split up & divided amongst other 3 Platoon Barbour & self to #12 9.30 p.m. We retd. to trenches on left this time. Felt rather weary of it all. Had no equip. hence no covering.

Wed. 26-7-’16
McClean & self slept in trench within Very cold. Woke up


[Page 51]
Wed. 26-7-’16
[indecipherable] & sought something warm. Found 3 sand bags to put over us. Pulled down a part breastwork & laid upon it until a.m. All night long Shrapnel & high explosives burst around us; files of men marched over us & still we slept the sleep of the truly "All out". During the a.m. I went for water to Gordon dump & had a wash (1st for 3 days) Discerned Gunner Dreine behind a very active 18 Pdr. He "will always take off his hat to the Infantry" he says. During A’f’noon I picked up some equip. an O’coat & W’proof sheet. Our Trench came in for some hvy. shelling & I witnessed Comrades being hit. My Helmet stove in.


[Page 52]
Wed. 26-7-’16
every few minutes C’main Jack Woods amongst them, also "Pretty" Morrison. Required all the fortitude you have inspired to keep me & help by example to calm others. We #12 platoon took Rifles & Bandoliers & marched (or ran rather) to Gordon Dump for rations. Here news awaited us. The 1st Div. to be relieved that very night. This was confirmed & we slept around "C" Coy’s Cooker all night. Good feed

Thurs. 27-7-’16
4.25 a.m. awaked by noise or something. I stole away back to when Charlie & I had been burried. I was after my diary & Charlie’s Haversack. After risking it I was doomed to disappointment.


[Page 53]
Thurs. 27-7-’16
Both haversacks looted. Discovered 1st Diary tossed to one side a little way up. Goodbye #2. This is #3. To-day I am a soldier of 1 yrs service & find myself risking life & limb for these records. These days it’s a case of "Courage rising with danger". Much too busy to worry. Later on 8 a.m. or so we found "C" Coy in old German trench in Sausage Valley. Moved again 6.30 p.m. Marched to Bivouac beyond & overlooking Albert. . Rejoiced to note signs of returning Civilian life in this fine town.

Fri. 28-7-’15
