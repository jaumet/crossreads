  
 Juillet 13 No 2 Duty Section today. Consequently we had an easy day. Other Sections working on the Canal. The [indecipherable] Cpl Bywater & I went fishing in the afternoon catching about 1/2 dozen fish each - very small tho'. Nothing of importance to note. 
 Juillet 14 No 2 Sec commenced work at 4.30 am pile driving on the Somme Canal - today - & worked until 12.30. Today should be a gala day in France but owing to the war everything is very quiet. A few flags may be seen flying from some of the houses but that is about all.
