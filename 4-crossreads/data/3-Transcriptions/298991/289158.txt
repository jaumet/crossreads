<p>Saturday April 14th<br/>Very quiet. Very startling news in the papers regarding the push at Arras. Was up this afternoon for half an hour for the first time. Felt very weak. Do a lot of reading to pass time away. Rather a dull day.</p>
<p>Sunday April 15th<br/>There has been about five fellows got their discharge from the army, in this ward since I have been here, they went out in civilian clothes, lucky beggars. There has also been a good few discharged to convalescent camp too. Rather a fine day. Some of the fellows have visitors &amp; relations come to see them, they are allowed in every Wednesday, Saturday &amp; Sunday from 2 till 4 pm.</p>
<p>Monday April 16th<br/>Very quiet. Another convoy arrived during the night. Left arm paining very much, lost use of it from the shoulder to the elbow; under galvanin treatment for same. I have to go down every morning at 9 am. I have to put my arms in two bowls of electrified water for about a quarter of an hour, &amp; then have them massaged.</p>
<p>Tuesday April 17th<br/>We received 22 patients out of the convoy. It arrived here about 3 am this morning. Snowed rather heavy today. I am well enough to walk about now. Was put on "duty" in the bathroom this morning, I only have to clean out two baths in the morning. On account of no orderlies here as soon as you are out of bed, you have to work.</p>
