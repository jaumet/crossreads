<p>for an hour on the edge of the Suez Canal.  This side of canal lined with trees for a depth of about 20 yds; very fortunate to have shelter as sun is very strong during day  Large Cruiser passed down Canal during morning, as well as  a number of other large boats.  Working all day unloading goods from boats.  Very short of rations, all we had for today was 6 biscuits &amp; bully beef; quite satisfied, cannot expect much more on active service.  Allotted to tents at night; very glad to turn in.</p>
