<p>Reconnaisance.  T'was here or near-abouts that Napoleon lost all his Cavalry, perished for Water, our movements are regulated by how much Water we have in our Water bottles &amp; the condition of the Horses &ndash; very sandy, very HOT.  Got some Camels, Goats, &amp; Bedouins only this stunt.  Our C.O who is a hot headed Irishman, said, when we were sent to find the aeroplane last week-<br/>"To hell, with their BALLOONS"<br/>"Ill not have my men perished, trying to find their b---dy Balloons"<br/>Each day one aeroplane accompanies us &amp; drops a little bag with a message in it now &amp; again to give us information.</p>
