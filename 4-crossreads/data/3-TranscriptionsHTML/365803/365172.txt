<p>My dear Ferguson</p>
<p>Your long kind and deeply interesting letter reached me yesterday. I   <strike>was</strike>  am very full it (in the better service of the Writer) and so reply at once. As to you boys, write to them brother, and tell them to come here whenever they get over on leave. Also, if they have the ill luck to get hurt, let them try to be sent to the V A Military Hospital. Millbank. I am chief of the Tommies part of it but W L Pilcher, Professor of  Military Surgery is the head of the officers section. &ndash; He is a really splendid man &ndash; and alright I say it that   [indecipherable] the Millbank Hospital is the boss Military Hospital in England. It is the Medical School of the R.A.M.C.</p>
<p>I fear political things in N. S.W. are getting more and more evil,   [indecipherable] and base. What a pity that most politicians, especially Asquith   &amp;  Birrell here, and Holman supporters and their labour masters in NSW, could not be  utilised as sandbags defences in France &ndash; and so spare a few of our boys</p>
