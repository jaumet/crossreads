  
 roam round Bapaume after tea : went into the vault under the ruined Cathedral & seen the skulls : there are hundreds of them & the tale is that they are the victims of the French revolution : heavy storm at night : thunder bad & lightening very vivid : mere mortals & their power seem very puny in comparison with nature : yarned before turning in, with the Lithgow "knuts" 
 Sunday July 8th 
 Bapaume : rain & very muddy : Holy Com at 9.30 & about 40 present : laid down after tea 
 Monday July 9th 
 Bapaume : showery : reveille 3.45 am : fell in in battle order & marched to our "stunt" ground : I was attached to the A.M.C. [Aust Medical Corps] for the day so done very little : the "boys" put in a heavy day & "advanced" a long way so finished up pretty tired.
