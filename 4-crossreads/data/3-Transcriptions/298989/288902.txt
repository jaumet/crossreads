<p>Anzac<br/>13/12/15<br/>keep up the noise while big parties are tamping the mines in main tunnels with sandbags taken from the support trenches. Fire trench being put into slap up order. One machine gunner (24th Battn) killed about 0930, bullet came through weak point in the emplacement and hit him in the stomach, - died almost at once.</p>

<p>No enemy aircraft up today but ours was aloft during the afternoon. Bombing &amp; sniping as usual and not so far as heavy from enemy as last night. Machine gun bullets flicking overhead in little whizzing flights. Another migration of birds appears to be taking place perhaps woodcock or quail. Some clouds of them flying very low and it was amusing to hear our</p>
