<p>1st S'thn Gen Hospital,<br/>Birmingham,<br/>20th January 1917.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Richards,</p>
<p>I was very sorry indeed to hear the sad news of Roy's death, and wish to convey my heartfelt sympathy to yourself and family in your very sad bereavement.</p>
<p>Nothing else on earth could have cast such a gloom over the Section, for he was idolised by every one.  Having been informed that the wound was only slight, we were pleased for his sake that he would get a rest, but we little knew the nature of that rest.</p>
<p>The last occasion on which we went to the trenches was the first time he and I had been separated, having been together ever since coming to France.  None knew him better than I did, and I can assure you his memory will ever live with us, for the memory of such a loving character can never fade.</p>
<p>Words can never describe our feelings, so will you kindly accept our sympathy, as we would wish it.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>(Sgd) Donald S. Gibson</p>
