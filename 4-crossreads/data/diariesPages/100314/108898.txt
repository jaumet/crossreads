3/3/18 Flixecourt
Left Amiens at 11.15 getting a seat in the Paris-Calais express as far as Longpre. On detraining fell in with some other Colonels mostly of British regiments and took a bus for the 4th Army School at Flixecourt. A Tommy guided us to billets ? mine is rather bare but Madame seems a cheery soul and owns two daughters one a Mademoiselle and the other aged 7. Walked back to the H.Q. Mess and found our way into a rather palatial place where they have a jolly good mess. The Chateau is a new one with walls carved and wood panelled and in the Mess they have W.A.A.Cs for waitresses. The Commandant is a full Colonel of the A Sutherlands
