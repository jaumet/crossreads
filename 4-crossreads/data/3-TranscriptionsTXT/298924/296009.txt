 Monday 27 January 1919 Cairo Arrived midday &amp; found the wife &amp; Babe well.  I am afraid the latter is rather spoilt by so much attention, but she is such a healthy strong youngster.  I enclose some more snaps but legs rather out of focus. Warmer here.  Best news is the Regt. sails 1st week in March, so we will be home by end of March.  Dolly will come with me if possible, if not she will sail end of February &amp; arrive about the same time, but will cable you.  Love from us all &amp; hoping to see you soon in the old home.  Your loving son Frank.
