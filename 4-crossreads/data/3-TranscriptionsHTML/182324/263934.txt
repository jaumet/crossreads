<p>I shall never forget our arrival at the home Port that voyage. After we had anchored we found our disembarkation was unavoidably delayed so the O.C. call all the Troops together &amp; asked the Captain &amp; myself to appear &amp; give out the prizes that had been won in the different sports that had been held on board &amp; after this had been done the O.C. made a speech to the Officers &amp; men &amp; I suddenly discovered traits in my character which I never knew was there. What little I did he magnified a thousandfold &amp; evidently the men all agreed with him if you could judge by the resounding cheers that followed &amp; then he presented us with those testimonials &amp; this broke me up. I tried to make a speech of thanks, but over flowing thoughts of how we had been spared to bring the brave fellows from far Australia, &amp; through that horrible danger zone fairly overcame me &amp; although an old Sailor is credited with a fairly adamant heart, it was too much for me. The surprise was too great &amp; I went under. So you can just imagine how I prize that beautiful testimonial from a crowd of the &quot;[finest?] Soldiers &amp; men&quot; that ever fought for Old</p>
