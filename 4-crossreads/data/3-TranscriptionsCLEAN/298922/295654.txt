  
 Friday 21 December 1917 
 Col. McLeish is writing to General Lee to get job for JOE in L.H. as now I feel he will not be content unless he comes. 
 PARCEL arrived containing SOKS, Bed Socks, Soap, Toffees, Shortbread - all very acceptable, the  best  soap always is COAL TAR Wrights by preference. BANJO Patterson is in camp adjoining me - & many men & Officers I have known for years.
