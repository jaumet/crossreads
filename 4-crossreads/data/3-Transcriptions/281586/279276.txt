<p>Said a lad to me "When I came away to the War, my Mother gave me this" showing me an old, warn, Bible.  "And, he continued, with a light laugh, "She believes that I still read it, and that I still pray"  He was then "going the pace"</p>
<p>1<br/>Your last fond gift to me<br/>Ah, then you little knew<br/>(As in your hand you held<br/>The volume old, and gave it to me <br/>then, with many prayers That I'd be true)<br/>Nor dreamed, such faith was thine<br/>That scarcely would the leaves<br/>Be turned, by hand of mine.</p>
<p>2<br/>Neglected was your gift,<br/>For long, aside it lay<br/>While, you, dear heart believed<br/>The inspired page, to be to me<br/>A source of joy and strength<br/>A lambent Ray<br/>Of light from God's own Throne<br/>And so you prayed, and thought my prayers<br/>Were mingling with your own.</p>
<p>3<br/>And so with measured pace<br/>The days rolled swiftly by<br/>And each with tales of broken vows<br/>To tell, and deeper peering in<br/>To sins dark ways<br/>Till God, on High<br/>Seemed very far away<br/>And judgment stirred no fears<br/>And love was stark and gray.</p>
