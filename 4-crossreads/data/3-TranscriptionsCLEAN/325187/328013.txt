Bronchitis betterMet another cousin Walter Weir, son of Uncle Joe Weir's- not a bad sort.Mr Ferrar takes me back per Motor today via Donoughmore or Tullamurry.  I passed thro Newry & many old sayings of the Pater came to mind  Had afternoon tea at Class Drummond no servants & great poverty, didn't see Joe although he knew I was coming   Frank & Lue both married. Kathleen 17 years old & had little education. the old place overgrown with weeds-Joe I believe had been drinking so did not stop long but very kind of course.
