<p>From the trenches<br/>Dugout<br/>25-4-1916</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>Well we are in action at last have been hard at it for some days now. The weather hasent been too good very wet &amp;amp: cold. I dare say we shall get used to it in time.<br/>You would have laughed could you have seen we fellows the first days we were in the trenches every time a shell came across we used to duck. One fell just behind our dugout well you should have seen the scramble to get under cover. Well it will take a lot of this to upset me.Things are very different to what I expected. We are more confortabble here than we were in the billets. The Germans have some great bombarding at our aroplanes we counted 678 shots fired at one  <strike>shell</strike> plane yesterday morning but she still flew about their trenches.</p>
