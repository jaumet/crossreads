<p><br/>2/12/15<br/>aboard no less than four during this journey and striking "sports" as skippers every time.  Came past CAPE Helles and one is struck by the narrowness of the straits  of the Dardanelles. The fort on the southern extremity of the cape blown to pieces the whole place now being crowded with our troops in their terraces.  Big flashes &amp; puffs of smoke denoted shelling.</p>
<p>Made for Imbros  Found Sparrow on board with a party for vegetables for the Division.  Learnt that Lone Pine have been catching it.  First indication was a number  of red flags (small) on Abduls parapets and then a hail of heavy ten inch howitzer shells  on L.P. blowing in our saps by the craters they made in their explosion and burying the miners.  150 casualties out of 600 garrison 60 killed including Dr Green.  Fighting in the tunnels but no attack.  If they had our men would have been at a great disadvantage.  Very cold there &ndash; 4 inches snow in trenches</p>
<p>Came into Kephalos about 1900 and drew alongside pier going dead slow as it is a ticklish piece of navigation.  Drew alongside another lighter and got ashore.  40 men arrived for armoured cars.  Searchlights active all the way across.  Found Camp shifted up gully and dined in mess on bully beef &amp; Worcester sauce.  A lot of Imperial officers came in tonight &ndash; no words of getting our stores off yet.  Tents pitched on hillside in made ground &amp; pegs loose</p>
