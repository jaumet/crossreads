11/10/15 Cold as - , pitch dark at "Stand to arms". Signallers woke us too early so had to freeze about for half an hour. Lovely fresh morning. Sea flecked with white caps. Took telescope searched whole position could see sailors at work on men ?o war distinctly. Abdul very jumpy during the night and pumping lead in wholesale. Saw men off duty indulging in latest sport. Take off shirts and search for "scotch greys", all are infested with colonies of lice. Being lousy a quaint novel feeling at first but after a while one would not be happy without a few about. 
Mere fleas no one troubles about. Burial party went out from next unit last night under fire, collecting corpses We had an advanced post reached by long underground tunnels to about half way between ours enemy trenches. Cut upwards for air and light are sort of manholes opening above ground. Burial party did not know what these were and looking round for likely holes dropped a dead man in each!! The garrison in this post nearly overcome with stench but stuck to it. Went up to arrange their removal (impossible until night); poor devils lying head first and all ways down these holes. One about 30, bald, dark no features left. The others young but quite unrecognisable. Ordered pioneers to collect them in blankets and bury them in rear. Colonel Onslow Thompson's grave with its cross actually in the trenches like many more
