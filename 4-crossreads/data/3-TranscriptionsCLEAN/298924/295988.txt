  
 Monday 6 January 1919 Letter from Joe posted at Honolulu, he will be home long since.  Just been yarning with an Officer from Beiyrut, he tells me the distress is very great up there among the civil population - Children picking up grain out of horse manure in the streets to eat!! Divisional Field Officer today, ramps are being built at the railway so men are evidently not marching further than this.  7 horses are sent by train.
