Dear Mrs VernonThank you very much for the parcel of summer clothing which came to me quite safely and in good order some few days ago.
They were indeed very welcome and some of the lads who had just come in from hospital were very glad indeed to have some of them.
we are grateful to the 1st A.L.H. Comforts Depot for many things sent on from time to time.
I am  yours sincerelyWalter Long.
