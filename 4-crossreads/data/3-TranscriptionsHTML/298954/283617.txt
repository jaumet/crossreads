<p>Astor and I were each examined in turn in the office of a most polite, and oily member of the Secret Service and told to be ready to move at 2 p.m.   At 2.30 p we emerged from our room to find the corridor crammed with prisoners &ndash; all just as they had been captured.</p>
<p>The artillery &amp; infantry were mostly in anti-shrapnel helmets;   the numerous Airmen were in Balaclavas and sheep-skin long boots.</p>
<p>In all there were about 50 assorted officers &ndash; mostly British.<br/>There were "regular" Captains and war-time "one pippers", Sandhurst flying veterans of 18 or 20 and war-time majors of 28 or thereabouts.   Strange to say this collection of birds actually found my tale of woe thrilling! one old bird who had "crashed" in a blazing 'plane actually shuddered because I said I had come through the blockade-line in the "Wolf's" hold!</p>
