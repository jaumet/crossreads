Sultry last night.<br/>7.4.16 Back to stables to-day and it has been very sultry cleaning things up down there. It is getting very warm and we will cross the equator very shortly I think. As soon as we got off we had to lump chaff from different hatches and then raise some rails. My word it was hot work. Last night we were supposed to have a concert on deck but after tea we found that the piano in the saloon was too big to be got through the doors and we were disappointed. Don't know how they got it in. Warm, with a following wind last night and sleeping on deck I got covered with coal specs from the funnel and only discovered it when I woke up this morning when a slight shower drove us in. I hate dirt of any kind like that and had to go straight off and get a wash which consists of pouring water from a dish over oneself.

It was decided last night to hold a concert on deck and the piano <u>did</u> come out of the saloon as it was our last opportunity of having one before Suez as in future no lights will be allowed after dark owing to the danger of Arab dhows engaged in gun-running being about but I don't think there is any <u>real</u> danger. Concert was a great success and some fine items were given also some bad ones. A topical skit on the Armadale was well received and "Because" by one time Sergeant George went well. The skipper didn't turn up as he doesn't appreciate music. It is said that he recently inherited &amp;pound 42000 but still persists in following the sea on the old Armadale, but I think it is an exaggeration. Started smoking again but the only available tobacco is awful and I am just getting used to it, (Capstan). over half-way now and I must prepare some letters for the Censor shortly. I wonder if they'll go alright? They will all be numbered in order.<br/>8.4.16 Expect to be on shore for Easter Sunday. Last night it was rather showery but I slung my hammock on deck and the waterproof ground sheet kept me from getting wet but I wasn't able to sleep much at all probably excited</p>
