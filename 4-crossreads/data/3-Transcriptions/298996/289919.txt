<p>20.6.15<br/>Things are very tame.<br/>We went sapping again to day but nothing exciting to report.

<p>21.6-15<br/>One would not think war is on here. I am told that there was a sham attack last night &amp; our fellow got a unpleasant surprise. They found out that the Turks are in bigger number than they expected. The navy is still bombarding. Acka Baba, &amp; big mail arrived to day &amp; I did not get a single letter &ndash; Letter from Dad.<br/>Letter from Dad</p>
<p>22-6-15<br/>I went to the trenches again this morning &amp; had a good look around it is simply wonderful the work the boys have done a regards sapping underground they are just about at their destination re under the Turkish trenches &amp; I expect they will blow same up anytime now. It has been very hot today. The Turks have been giving us a warm time today re showering shrapnel all around us. They had a go at one of the trawlers but it got a move on quick &amp; lively. The navy is still giving Acka Baba something to go on, a dam warm time.<br/>When in the trenches we asked a Indian gunner what he thought of our Soldiers he said in his lingo I hear the shrapnel starts to come &amp; have a friendly spar with us he said. The Indian soldier prays, the English crouchers in the nearest cover, The Frenchman runs. The Australian soldier, You Bastard. The New Zealander, here bugger that, &amp;  the way he said it made one laugh until tears rolled down one's cheeks. It was a beautiful moon last night last I did not tuck in until 12 PM of course but had supper before we adjourned re Bully beef rice &amp; Potatoes mixed boiled &amp; Coffee.
