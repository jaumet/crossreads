Anzac13/12/15sports wasting a few bullets into them & hear the sharp crack of Mausers as the Turks in front did the same. Heavy rumble of artillery in the distance seemingly from the direction of Narrows. Rumoured an 11 inch howitzer was put into position by our people today so old Abdul should get some hurry up from it.
At Brigade headquarters during afternoon and talking to Brigade Major. Had a narrow escape before tea, a stick bomb burst near Parade Ground and big splinter smashed into bank a few inches off. Several thought  I was hit but I walked on  as if nothing happened - needless to say the unconcern was far from what I was feeling.
Turned in at 2045 and except for sundry messages &c had a good rest.
14/12/15Called out at 0500 to speak to Brigade Major Goucher in connection with spies who are suspected to be about and several suspicious events have occurred. Just after retiring last night I heard a fumbling and creeping noise on the hillside and took revolver and crawled on belly on a stalking expedition. Just nearing the quarry when a flow of good crimson Australian oaths and curses established the bonafides of the person who was a signal linesman repairing a fault in a telephone wire that runs on the ground all along the scrubby hillside.
Colonel Crouch got away before dawn so will now be on his way to Mudros. Our patrols saw some Turks wandering round in front probably snipers. Owing to units getting out some have not destroyed their rum and the flowing bowl has been circulating round some dugouts rather fully. Taking strict precautions.
Beachy Bill shelling the beach in bursts. Cleaving everything heavy right out of the place altogether. Expect some fun here soon & the devil take the hindmost.
