It appears that some of the N.Z' s &amp; Australians started a row near 'Eldorado'  near Shepheards Hotel.  They ransacked numberless brothels, piled the furniture in the road &amp; burnt it.  The 'Red Caps'  (Territorial Military Police) came along &amp; shot about a dozen men killing 4 or 5.  Brawls kept taking place everywhere until 9.30 p.m. (we had to be out of Cairo by then).  The town was patrolled all night by picquets.</p>
