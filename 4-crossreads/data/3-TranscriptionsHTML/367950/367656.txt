<p>accidents .A squadron of ours went out and took up a position in some old Turkish trenches about 2 &frac12; miles south of this camp where we had a scrap with them before and they had a most wonderful system of trenches with a splendid "field of fire". They were no doubt built under orders of some of the best German Engineers .To guard against detection by our aeroplanes they had interlaced cut bush and sticks amongst the sand thrown up so as to minimize the risk of detection from overhead.<br/><u>Note</u> =Aeroplane reconnaissance is never too reliable .The machine must keep up at least 5 or 6000 feet to minimize the risk of being brought down and from that height very little detail can be observed. They are no doubt armed with the best field glasses and telescopes but one must not forget the great vibration of the machine when one considers how frail the machine is in its construction and then attached to that there is Gnome motor Engine of at least 200 horsepower one can well imagine the tremendous vibration which results  &ndash; Our own airmen inform us that when flying our own (Known) camps at the height that a Taube would fly &ndash;say that it is impossible to see the camps and the  only thing they can see is the shadows thrown by the tents in the morning and late in</p>
