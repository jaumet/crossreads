<p>Saturday Jan 26th 1918 &amp; Sunday 27<br/>Left camp about 9 a m fully loaded this time ammunition &amp; dry rations - &amp; marched to the railway at Le Harve between 5 &amp; 6 milea a very bad road &amp; as it was hot it took a lot out of us. The train did not leave untill afternoon We were packed 32 in a cattle truck just enough room to lie down by fitting in close Tea was supplied about 9 &amp; there was plenty of butter buscuits  Jam &amp; cheese in each truck. Put in quite a good night &amp; have traveled slowly with many stops Detrained at Castre &amp; marched about 2 miles to a small camp getting there just at dusk &amp; were alloted to tents &amp; given an extra blanket. The country is very flat &amp; uninteresting as far as I have seen. Saw a few shell holes about Hasellbrock a fair sized place few miles back The only reall signs of war so far</p>
<p>Monday 28th<br/>Went for a very short march this morning without packs. Can hear</p>
