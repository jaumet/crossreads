We got into a little dip in the ground next Bgde. H.Qs. & remained there all the morning.The attack proceeded & at about 2 p.m. our fellows got into the turks first trenches & - horrible dictn.! - were shelled out by our own artillery who were going hammer & tongs all the while.At about 4 p.m. things got very willing & we were having a lot of casualties.  I went out with another, Robertson - not the same as at Romani - to go up to the support trench.  We had not gone half a mile across the flat when Robertson stopped one in the groin & fell off his horse.  We bundled him into the sand cart, it being too exposed there to dress him & went on.I was riding the other side of him thus making the second time that a Robertson has stopped a bullet that would otherwise have stopped in me.
