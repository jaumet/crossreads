I think I told you in my last letter that I was picked to go first on Bolougne leave. This has now fallen through and instead we have been promised   lond   leave to England, in turn. We tossed up again to see who would be first on the list. I came second in a throw off, after having tied for first place. At the time we expected it to come off very shortly but up to the present we have heard no more about it. I am afraid it will be some time now before it eventuates.

 P.S. You might let me have Kevin's address when writing next.
