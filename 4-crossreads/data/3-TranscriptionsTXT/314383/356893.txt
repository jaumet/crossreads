 June 25th Nothing doing as regards work.  A little girl of about 12 years of age came along to the camp for washing.  She struck me owing to her cleanliness &amp; tidiness &amp; pretty little face. I asked her what she was &amp; she said 'Turko' the name of the tribes out back &amp; also told me her story which was that she had walked from a village 17 miles away yesterday as all her people had died &amp; on hearing that the English were in Bijah had come along to see if she could get any work.  She then burst into tears asked if the English would punish her.  I then took her to the Interpreter who verified what she had to say. 
 Knowing that she would die if unprovided for, I arranged thru the Interpreter for her to go into a Persian home in Bijah for which I would pay 4 Francs a day (2/6). 
 June 26th Nothing doing.  My birthday forgot until 27th.
