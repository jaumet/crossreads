as they go nearly every day I can see myself almost going now.  So while I have a little time I will send this off to you.  I know you will be somewhat disappointed at it, for you are eagerly watching for a letter of our work.- the next I trust will be more appropriate- though as far as war news goes you understand that one cannot write freely, Tis not that I am not as keen as anyone for I shall just love to be in the swim of work & do not mind in the least roughing it, but on the other hand I like to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves & as I can write to you of things I see- though others do the same for there must be tons of letters go to Australia about Egypt I hope mine won't be too stale.With loving greetings to you all,Sincerely YoursAnne Donnell
P.S.  Have notice to hold myself in readiness for Lemnos.  All things comes to those who wait, I will be so happy to be there.
Love   AD
