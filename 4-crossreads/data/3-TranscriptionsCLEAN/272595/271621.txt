  
 Very hot & cloudy this afternoon looks like a change setting in.  Had a good hot bath & a proper clean up this afternoon then went for a walk round this quiet little village of Harefield, one can scarce believe that's its only 20 minutes run by train from London, in the evening I wrote a few letters & in a few minutes I am going round to the pictures which they show nightly here. 6th.  Left Harefield again this morning & arrived in London about 11 oclock   Marched round to Horsferry Rd. to see about our leave & etc, here we were delayed for a couple of hours as per usual while the red tape was in action, got away about 1 oclock & took my things down to Peel House, then
