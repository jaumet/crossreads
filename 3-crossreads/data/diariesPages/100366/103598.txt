 
got the baggage off & moved to a prepared billett to rest. Throwing ourselves on the floor we tried to get some sleep but the intense cold defeated our object. By this time it was growing daylight so I decided to get up & have a wash.

After washing in bitterly cold water I had a bit of breakfast & took a walk round the village. One place of interest was the Cathedral Ancient writings on the wall showed it to have been started in the year 600 by a monk named Saint Ruquiet. It is a marvellous piece of archicteture & the inside built on modern principles was wonderful to look at. I left this place at 10am per foot for Ailly a distance of 6 miles. Arrived there very tired & commenced issuing. The rain again poured down & I am now perfectly satisfied that fine weather is a thing of the past. My section is now quartered in a barn which although rough will be warm.

Ailly is an old place of a few thousand inhabitants and in the Department of the Somme, but a good way behind the Line. Our future movements area unknown as yet, but it is presumed that we will rest for a while.
