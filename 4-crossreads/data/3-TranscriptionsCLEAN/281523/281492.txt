We ran and tumbled over duckboards and shell holes fountains of flame and dirt shooting up from round about.  A shell landed a couple of yards from our party and failed to detonate.  The barrage of our guns was due to commence at 5 am so we were rushing against time and tumbled down the steps of the Bde HQ at Birr Cross roads absolutely done.  Poor old doctor was very exhausted and a little hysterical.  We waited underground with the Brigade Staff and I had a talk with the General.  Left about 6 and caught a motor lorry which had just dumped shells and went down the Menin Road which was not being heavily shelled.  One 8 inch one landed 100 yards - a pretty sight solid flame and sparks leaping heavenwards.  An enormous cloud of dark smoke drifted away and the air was full of dust and fumes as our motor lorry charged through it.  Through Ypres picking up some kilties also coming out of the line and at the Asylum found Crawthorne
