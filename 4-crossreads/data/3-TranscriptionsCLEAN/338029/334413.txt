Sunday 11th Feb.C.P. by Bishop in a.m., quiet day.
Monday 12th Feb.Choppy sea, a few seasick, arrive Freemantle to-morrow.
Teusday 13th Feb.We sighted land about 10 a.m., our dear Australia the sight I have longed for on so many occasions we finally anchored outside Freemantle harbour and placed in quarantine.  All the W. Aussies got their mits up to disembark but after two hours waiting they were told to go below till morning.  At nine p.m. all clocks were set back 2 hours owing to the Daylight Savings Bill.  That means once & instead of Ten I went to bed at Twelve and arose at 3-30 p.m.  I felt sorry for The Wet's so near and yet so far I was informed I have to act as Warrant Officer to Melbourne, the other man getting off here.
