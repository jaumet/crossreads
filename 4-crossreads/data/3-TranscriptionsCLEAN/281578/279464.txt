to a road, where we waited for the motor buses to come. A great lot came along one after the other, 25 got on each 'bus & the 4th Brigade (13, 14, 15, & 16th Btns.) travelled on them, so there were a few. Passed through several villages, & cultivated fields were on each side of the road. A long line of new trench was dug, & barbed wire ready, a new position to fall back on. We eventually came to a village full of French troops, & some wore loose hanging caps & different colored uniform to the usual light blue, they were fine styles of men, very solid & big, one told me they were chasseurs, & they have just come from the Italian front. Every French soldier I have seen is a big chap, much different to the weedy Tommies about. I thought we would be billeted in this town, but we straightway marched out of it, & wondered where we were off to, & why the motors couldn't have taken us right there. We went 2 or 3 miles & halted in the midst of big trees & long trees grass, & it looked very cheerless with rain threatening. It was 6.30 p.m., & to our delight tents arrived, & were soon put up, & when we got them up, it began to rain, so we were O.K. The field kitchens arrived & hot tea & rations were given out. We are near Amiens for
