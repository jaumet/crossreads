<p>7 March, 1916<br/>Serapeum<br/>As most of the Squadron was on Fatigue we did not go out to drill but Lieut Smith or someone got some harebrained scheme about having saddles on rails so they got us to rig up some iron rails to put the saddles on,  One would think we were here for the rest of the year.  To night there is the sound of great cheering coming from where the canteens are; from reports that are coming in I believe that the niggers who are running these canteens are having a really torrid time &amp; the canteens are being pulled down.  I am on in charge of the stable picquet to night, not a bad job, the horses are very quiet on it</p>
