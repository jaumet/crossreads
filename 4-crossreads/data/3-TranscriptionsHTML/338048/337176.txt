<p>25th Tuesday<br/>I started leave to London about 11 am today &amp; have to go back about 5 pm Saturday. We arrived in London about 4 p.m. and have already heard a debate in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>I am writing this sitting on my bed in a Y.M.C.A. so that I can post it tomorrow but must close. I will give further London news when the trip is finished &amp; I write for the next mail.</p>
<p>Yours with best love<br/>Sid</p>
