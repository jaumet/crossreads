<p>&amp; we cut about together. Ralph no doubt knows all the places of interest &amp; can describe them much better than me.<br/>My next stage in convalescance, then furlough.<br/>Winter is starting now, never mind sending my anything dear as I can buy all I want through the ordinance on my deferred pay.<br/>Well Lizzie you will have to excuse this scribble as I am going out for the day. So love to self &amp; family.<br/>From yours as ever<br/>Ken.</p>
