  
 The "Primula" and the "Ficaria", two fast but obsolete arks of the Skandanavic-Amerika line, were waiting for us with steam up.   In the crush in the big waiting rooms on the wharf Ted & I lost the others, & we two boarded the "Ficaria" while Geo. & Co took the ""Primula". 
 They are sister-ships and are now fitted up in troopship style with bunks and mess-room.   A home-like touch has been attempted by putting palms, flowers, & tiny silk flags, on the tables.   There is not room in the cabins for even all the women, so we needs must take a bunk somewhere in the depths of the forward hold. 
 The thoughts of mines under such circs. are not pleasant. 
 However, the food is equally as good as that on the "Kong Haakon";  though we would like to continue to England on that dandy ship. 
 At 9 pm the two vessels left for England, crowds lining the wharves and cheering.
