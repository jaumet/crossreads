<p>Tuesday 2 May 1916<br/>Very rough today but does not affect me now I have got my sea legs.  It knocks the horses about a lot;  they lost 90 head one trip here.<br/>Had a medical inspection in afternoon.  This boat shifted some Indian troops before coming for us.  Hope they fumigated it well.</p>
<p>Wednesday 3 May 1916<br/>Felt rather unwell in night (not sea-sickness) went to Dr. who painted my throat &amp; gave me medicine.<br/>Three more horses died.<br/>I went on picquet from 6 p.m. to 10.  Saw light house on King George's sound in evening.<br/>Was put on carrying chaff to bins as I did not feel well enough for stables.</p>
