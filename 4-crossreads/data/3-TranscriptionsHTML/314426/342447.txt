<p>morning and it is rumoured that the railway men are out on strike and all trains are stopped.<br/>I have been playing draughts this morning. We found a set of men in one of the cupboards.<br/>Friday February 7. 1919. 89.<br/>Much finer today. The sun is shining brightly this evening. Owing to the cold weather I have stayed indoors this past 3 days.<br/>Saturday February 8. 1919. 90<br/>A fine day.<br/>I am staying indoors today as I feel out of sorts. The papers came by motor last night. The tube strike promises to end in a fiasco, and the electricians fearing the stern measures adopted by the Government are afraid to come out. If they do they will be dealt with D.o.r.a.<br/>Sunday February 9. 1919. 91<br/>Fine but cold. I stayed in the ward all day.<br/>Monday February 10. 1919. (92)<br/>Very cold cloudy and windy. The wind is freezing and the water in the drains is frozen over.<br/>Tuesday February 11. 1919. 93.<br/>A fine day. The Sun is shining out bright and warm, and the wind has moderated.<br/>Dr. Tagett was late</p>
