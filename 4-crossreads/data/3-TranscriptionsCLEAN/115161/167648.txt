  
 between three to four miles an hour, when it suddenly stopped, the exertion had been too great, it must have a spell for a time.  We offer to get out and push, but this upsets the driver to such an extent that we fear he will "chuck" a fit.  He throws his arms about and gets apparently very excited, while he is - we imagine - trying to explain the situation to us. 
 This kind of thing goes on all the time.  We move forward for about a couple of hundred yards and then the engine needs a rest.  The effort is beyond it. 
 At about 11.p.m. we arrive at the once beautiful, but now devastated town of 
  ALBERT . 
 We have taken about four and a half hours to travel about eight miles.  It was a "through express", the driver apparently had left Bapaume a little late so had to make up the time on the journey, which accounted for the early arrival at our destination !! 
 We "detrained" at Albert, and a funny-looking lot we were, most of us were nearly black from the smoke in the trucks caused by our patent braziers.  Why we detrained at Albert is a mystery to this day.  However we got out and put our packs on and collected our rifles and then marched to Buire, a distance of about six miles.  The train also goes on to the same place, but why on earth it is allowed to go empty is beyond our comprehension.

I don't think it arrived there before us though, despite the fact that its burden was so much lighter. 
 We talked this matter over a good deal in our spare time, and the conclusions we arrived at were that the authorities who had been engaged on working out this move had only been able to arrange or think out the journey as far as Albert, then either their brains gave out or it was time for a
