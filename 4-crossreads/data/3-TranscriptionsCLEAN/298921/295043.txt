  
 March, 1915 Thursday 11 Pay day today we get paid every fortnight, it costs me 20 Piastres per day = 4/- for Mess & many of us go to the Continental & Shepherds at week ends. The wags say these are the Bars we will get on our Medals:- Tomorrow we have a Divisional day, fighting the Lancastrian Brigade & Artillery good instruction, so I'm off to bed early.
