<p>worry the men, &amp;  had a parade at 4 p.m., rifle inspection &amp; foot inspection, then we had to burn the straw in the dugouts, &amp; got fresh stuff. I'm in a dugout with old Mitchell, he's not a bad old chap, but I miss my good pals of the grand old 3rd Bn, &amp; have no particular pal here. Went along to B Coy to see Boo, was delighted to find him fit &amp; well, also Eldridge. Had a letter from Will today.  Friday 28 June Decent sleep last night, reveille 7.30 this morning. They wouldn't let us rest in peace, there was a parade at 9 &amp; inspection. Lewis gun teams fell out for instruction, then the scouts, &amp; there were only 6 of us left, the company is pretty weak now. We were put on filling in shell holes on the ground where we fall in, it would be laughable, only it annoys you after coming out of the line. The sergeant major went crook on us, because the O.C. (a big, fat, bullock driver to look at, who has just come to us, after the good man we lost) went off at him because there was nobody working once; they had all sloped. We fell in again at 2 p.m., &amp; a sergeant was told to march us away, &amp; give us rifle exercises. Didn't the boys growl as they marched off; no wonder, men out from the front line for a rest getting recruits'</p>
