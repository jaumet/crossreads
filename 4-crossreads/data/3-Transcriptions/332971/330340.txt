<p>My dear Friends</p>
<p>Just to let you see that I had at least made the attempt to send you a long letter I am sending the following which was written during the first few days at Cannes but has never been re-written for you.  I think you will all know why &ndash; so I need not apologise &ndash; and I am hoping to make amends by sending another within a month which will include the G.G.S. for on second thoughts I am sure that any little [indecipherable] will be as nothing to what you are reading to-day or since the great offensive started.</p>
<p>Go Lady Gifford<br/>Hotel de le Esterel<br/>Cannes<br/>Feb 1st 1918</p>
<p>Dears</p>
<p>Where do you think I am &ndash; And what doing, convalescing from over-tiredness in the Riviera <strike>and </strike> sitting on a high bank of green grass in the warm sunshine &ndash; and facing the lovely blue</p>
