<p>9.10.15<br/>Sat 9th<br/>A sapping party was sent to do some work from C Sqd this morning &amp; when returning to camp in full-view of the Turks as usual Mr Turk gave them a few shots, killing Newton &amp; wounding Colin Cameron in the leg, the wound is only a flesh one &amp; I think Sandy in the happiest man on the Peninsula. Les gave him a sov. as he was out of cash;The storm that has been threatening us lately paid us a visit last night. I went around early &amp; arranged a couple of oilsheets over us, shifted the 'phone under them &amp; was a warm &amp; dry as if we were at home, the boys in the trenches had a very rough time &amp; it was that dark that it was impossible to see anyone more than a couple of feet away: The patrol also had a very rough time of it</p>
