 1916   SUNDAY 30   JULY 
 Fine & hot. We all went to a church parade at Larkhill. The Bishop of Salisbury was preaching & he gave us a very decent little sermon & we could hear all he said, which is more than can be said for most church parades. Bill & Jack Hunter & Warren Hogarth & Self got a car & went into Salisbury for dinner. We expected to meet Mother but she did not turn up. Had lunch at the Country Hotel. We saw Capt & M rs  Chicken there & had a long yarn. Walked round town afterwards & went all over the Cathedral. It is a wonderful place inside & quite the most beautiful I have ever seen. You seem to be in a different world when you get inside. Had dinner at the Country Hotel & got a car back to camp.
