<p>14 Sept, 1916<br/>Bir El Hassaniya<br/>I had to go on guard yesterday after noon on ammunition, it was a sweet job; especially for me, a very rough turn out though.  I heard Myers this morning wondering if he need put on his boots &amp; socks.  He is an artist is Carl   He entertained us with some of his Gallipoli experiences.  His pet greivence at present is that Billy [Rose?] has been given a stripe</p>
<p>Our bivvie at El Hassaniya<br/>For Restfulness comfort &amp; [cheer?]<br/>With home would compare,<br/>What! Would you dare.<br/>Say, I don't think<br/>Guess Ell is more near</p>
