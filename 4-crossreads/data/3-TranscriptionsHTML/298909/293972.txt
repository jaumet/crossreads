<p>Very dusty all day &ndash; Drill all the morning &ndash; we also had collection of supposed wounded, up sand hills &amp; down the banks of the Canal &ndash; In the evening we had a medical inspection &ndash; one man was put out. They also made enquiries about our gear &amp; the Major said he wanted us to be uniformly dressed as we would be criticised in France. All our Ambulance transport horses were commandeered by the Artillery &amp; today we got in a draft of raw mules, talking about fun on the Bristol &ndash; any man could pick one &amp; do his worst. I never laughed so much for a long time.</p>
