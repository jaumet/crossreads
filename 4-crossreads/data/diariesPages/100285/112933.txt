30th. It has been a lovely glorious day nothing but sunshine from morning till night, just the opposite to yesterday.
Heard tonight that the 1st, 5th 9th Battn's had been broken up to reinforce the remainder of the Div. what a shame if it is true for those Battalions have a record that all are proud of why it seems as if one is parting with something that is part of his life, I can hardly realize its true myself they must be wanting men very bad to take such a drastic step as this with the old 1st Div. I for one will not like the idea of going back to a strange unit after being so long with the good old black green.
