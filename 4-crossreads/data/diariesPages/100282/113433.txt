4th. Capt Edgely had the mob out wiring round my "strong post" last night batmen, Company Clerk all were out didn't they like it, bit of a change for them I believe it was very funny to see the way they ducked when old Fritz swung his gun across the open ground searching for any stray fatique parties who may be unlucky enough to get in his way, if he only knew how close he comes to our dugouts he would keep his gun going I'll bet, sometimes he plonks bullets in our doorway.
The stretcher bearers I had a narrow escape this afternoon old Fritz shelled our possies heavily for  an hour or so he dropped 1 5.9 not more than 3 yards from our dugout, gave us all a proper headache from the concussion.
This soap powder for the men's feet is a regular farce, they are supposed to wash their feet powder them twice
