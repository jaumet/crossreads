<p>17.7.18<br/>Didn't get up till 5 and then cleaned rifle and things, wrote diary before going out as usual.  Hot &amp; sultry &amp; tired.  Out at 9 and with Reid and got 4 dugouts finished.  Very good work but didn't get home till 2.30.  Fairly quiet although some shells on support lines.  Very dark coming home and took another way home.  Rumours of Scots going over against Meteren but didn't come off.</p>
