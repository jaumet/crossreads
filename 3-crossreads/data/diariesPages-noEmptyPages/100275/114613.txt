9th. This morning we packed up moved off from Halloy-Pernois toward the firing line, it was a scorching hot morning, the dust was something awful far worse than the marching which was quite stiff enough for anyone.
We passed a lot of our artillery, the 5th Brigade on the way back they did not get the cutting up we did, we had a good long spell on the grass while the Artillery passed us.
We are now in billets about 6 miles from Halloy.
Received quite a budget of letters yesterday, Gretas photo among them how she has changed.
