<p>8 June 1915<br/>Tuesday Quinns attacked</p>
<p>The attack proved futile as usual, 180 of the Aucklands were sent out &amp; they lost 80&percnt; of them we succeeded in reaching the trench but couldn't hold it. Gen Godly supervised this one himself so now he ought to be convinced, the wounded started to come down at daybreak, but luckily the nature of the wounds is very slight. Hal &amp; I went up for our usual shooting again in the morning &amp; found sport very brisk we fired just on 180 rounds &amp; then returned for lunch, Our shooting has improved wonderfully &amp; now are down to the clock 6", went in for a swim after lunch &amp; down there met Pat Eyre who had just returned from hospital he was wounded the first day he landed. A mail arrived today &amp; I received two from Nell they came as a welcome break, another is expected on Friday. A monitor pays us a visit &amp; is to proceed round the corner &amp; give a village a little pill or two, heaps of shrapnel again all day, its about time they stirred it up, bullets lodge in our dugout</p>
<p>9 June 1915<br/>Wednesday 43 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>The Turks welcomed us with a bombardment of our valley for a couple of hours &amp; all out guns responded with a roar the Razor came in for a special helping &amp; the way they knocked the trenches about was a picture Then Hal &amp; I went up to our position &amp; caught them busily rebuilding their loopholes, it didn't take long to quieten them for our shooting is too deadly &amp; the second shot generally finds the mark. The Monitor opened fire on the Turks transport today &amp; did good practice with their 6" gun. Isla Tepe has not shown up lately for a wonder. I received another 3 letters today two from home &amp; the mail is expected tomorrow. Worked on our new home all the afternoon &amp; succeeded in finishing it &amp; we took over at 5, &amp; are having a house warming tonight. Rumored that the monitor succeeded in bagging the 6" Howitzer the Turks were bringing up per traction engine we couldnt reach it yesterday but had to wait until it came within range, so hope its true.</p>
