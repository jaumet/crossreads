<p>1918<br/>Thu.  14th Feb.<br/>This morning the snow-capped heights of the Norwegian coast loomed up ahead and we turned South.</p>
<p>We are strictly forbidden to go on deck but we glimpsed the coast through the door coverings when the sentry was also looking out.</p>
<p>We had an hour on deck a day or two ago &ndash; the weather clear with a smooth heavy roll.</p>
<p>Quite a number of the crowd are now taking a more or less surreptitious interest in Bibles and Rosaries.   Just before midnight I came out to find Dempsey, the boastful Canadian n-c-o from Singapore, sitting in the centre of the hold close to a water tight door buried in a bible.</p>
<p>He has gone quite hysterical;  he grabbed me as I passed and told me to "pray for deliverance, it is all we can do now."</p>
<p>I unsympathetically sent Webbie to make the German guard send him to bed &ndash; he was a disturbing influence on some people.</p>
