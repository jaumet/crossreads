29/11/18 Nicetrain is cut in half at Nice and waits half an hour. The wagon restaurant or dining car has had a wonderful day bfast today going all day long. The journey from Nice to Monte Carlo did not take long and I found a charabanc at the station which ran me up to the Monte Carlo Palace Hotel a fine place where only a few people seemed to be staying. At dinner there were not many people at all. Two girls in a family party were smoking and "making up" at the table. This place is in the Principality of Monaco and an independent state. The Casino is going in full swing and some of the people from here went down during the evening. I wrote and read for a while and then retired early to my room to make up by a good sleep tonight for what I lost last night.
