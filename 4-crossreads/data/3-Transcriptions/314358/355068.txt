<p>6<br/>It is this presence of an unseen veil which some ancient magic has wrapped all Egypt in wherein lies that spell of mystery which fascinates.</p>
<p>I am never weary of looking at these mountains.</p>

<p>In the evening with the sun sinking behind, they are like a fixed cloud of the air, not at all of the earth, but "of the stuff that dreams are made of" so much so is this [indecipherable] if a person beheld them for the first time at such a moment her could not readily believe them to be mountains of this solid earth. And the color of them at such a time is as gorgeous as a purple cloud of sunset</p>
<p>Indeed with a top fringe of firey gold they would rival all that even the clouds can do.</p>
