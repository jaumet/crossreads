  
 4/12/18 Nice Another fine day but inclined to be hazy and here is how I loafed it away. Stayed in bed till 9 and then had chocolate and a roll before going up the Avenue de la Gare to buy a local paper. Returned to Promenade des Anglais there to bask in the sun and read the latest news till lunch. Watched the crowd passing and repassing and then went to the Hotel Westminster for lunch. After repeated the performance meeting a Yank Lt and walking with him and having an adventure with two little Nicois - walkon walkoff actresses at Les Varieties. To Yank YMCA in Casino until 7.30 and then dined well and dearly at the Hotel Ruhl et Anglais. This is one of the finest hotels to be met with anywhere & admirable cusine. Few people about the streets as I returned to room at Hotel du Luxembourg.
