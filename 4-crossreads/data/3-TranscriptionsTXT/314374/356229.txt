 (45) put their money on the mules for the races.  A mule will not (or cannot) run in a straight line, but generally runs sideways and they used to sometimes finish the race from where they started.  The 41st Battalion was camped in a wood about a mile from us.  While here I received word that my brother Charlie, who was badly gassed at Villers Brettenaux and had been several months in hospital in England had returned to Australia. 
 One beautiful fine day when we were drilling in a field a German 'plane flew over very high up (just like a speck in the sky).  Our antiaircraft guns ("Archies") were firing and we left off drilling to have a look at the 'plane.  Whilst we were so doing one of the nose caps from one of the shells fell amongst us &ndash; falling on one of our men and killing him instantly. 
 That night we had a terrific thunderstorm &ndash; the worst that we had experienced in France. 
 A good supply of chocolate came to hand here which was rushed by us and the canteen sold out in no time.  I was one of the chocolate fiends of the Battalion.  Once a pal and I walked 15 kilos (10 miles) away to a neighbouring village where we were told that we could buy chocolate.  We bought the chocolate alright (quite a quantity of it before tasting it).  It was manufactured in Paris and called "Melba" but we were taken in.  It was mostly sawdust and grit with a little sugar and cocoa mixed with it.  Sugar was very scarce and very few sweets were obtainable so we used to look forward to receiving parcels from Australia containing lollies and chocolates. 
 I saw several Grafton boys who were camped near to us here.  One day we marched to Cirquevelles for a bath, and saw a very ancient and interesting water wheel working.  There were plenty of windmills here and they were used to crush the wheat &amp;c.  These windmills are a common and familiar sight in rural France. 
 Whilst we were here the authorities tried to disband the 42nd Battalion and distribute us in other battalions, but we had a meeting and refused to be disbanded.  Each man was very proud of his own Battalion's record in the war, and this spirit amongst the Australians helped to make the army the great success it was. 
 We were now practising in earnest for the great Battle as the Germans had retreated to their wonderful stronghold the Hindenburg Line and from which they thought that they would never be expelled. 
 On 27th September we marched from Doingt at sundown and went 14 Kilos to the reserve trenches.  During one of our rests for a smoko a bomb fell from a German 'plane quite close to us, and killed a few mules but no men, only slightly wounded a couple.  The next day we were preparing for the battle and getting everything ready.  The Americans were to attack first and take the front German line and we were then to advance and relieve them.  That night enemy 'planes came over all night long dropping bombs and several of the men at the rear of us were killed and wounded, by long range shells.  Sometimes one was safer in the front line trench than in the back areas.
