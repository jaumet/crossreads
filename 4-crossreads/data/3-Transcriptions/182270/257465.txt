<p>MONDAY, JUNE 2, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; warm. Sister went down</p>
<p>by day train &amp; Father &amp; Mother &amp; Peter</p>
<p>went in in the big car. I was round</p>
<p>the bottom end in morning, tried</p>
<p>to fix the engine onto Middle</p>
<p>Bore, but had a job with the</p>
<p>pipe. Gave delivery of 30 bullocks</p>
<p>to T Considine and 1 bull for</p>
<p>him to deliver to Watt&nbsp;&amp; Abbot.</p>
<p>Went for a drive round the</p>
<p>Hill paddock in afternoon</p>
<p>with Linda.</p>
