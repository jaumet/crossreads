 Octobre 13 Still working on shelters at West Hoek. We are having wet cold weather &amp; every thing is getting in a bad state owing to the mud. The attack yesterday is now reported to have been a failure owing chiefly to the heavy rain. Where our troops went out &amp; gained their objectives they had to retire again as they could not operate in the mud &amp; water. 
 Octobre 14 Working on shelters for Infty at "Hooge Ridge". Finer weather today. A good deal of artillery activity on both side the Line. Enemy aeroplanes over tonight dropping bombs.
