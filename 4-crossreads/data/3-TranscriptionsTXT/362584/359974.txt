3drawers each capable of holding a good deal. Here I have stowed away secretly all my tobacco, cigars, cigarettes & buiscuits. Fourthly & fifthly we have an electric light & fan & sixthly the switches for each, which repose just above my head as I lie in bed. Seventh & last but not least comes an electric bell, which by ringing once brings the steward & twice the stewardess. I have come to the conclusion that the stewardess must be deaf, as I am continually ringing for her without success.
I cannot tell you the name of the ship we are on, but I am not forbidden to state that it has not changed since our embarkation which took place one week ago to-morrow. I am so sorry I cannot tell you the date.
So far we have had a beautiful trip, & though once or twice we thought we were running into a storm the weather has been as calm as possible.
There is absolutely no news, & even if there was I would not be allowed write it, so as I have come to the end of the page & the beginning of the bad writing I had better stop.
With heaps of love
Your loving son
Keith
