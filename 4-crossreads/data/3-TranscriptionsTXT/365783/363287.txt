I think I will be dining with him tonight at Broadmeadows. He says that he will not be returning to Newcastle & in this I think he is quite right.I hope to write again before leaving Melbourne. Our next call will be Fremantle. Goodbye dearest Mrs & God bless you all. Let Father & Mother see this letter.Your loving husbandWill.Haven't seen Fred since Sunday.W.H.R.
