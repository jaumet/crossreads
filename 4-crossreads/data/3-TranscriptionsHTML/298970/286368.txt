<p>4th August (Friday)</p>
<p>We passed through a night of anxious terror, sitting huddled up in the small dug-out &ndash; four of us.  For days past Fritz has been exposing a notice "Keep your heads down till August 4th".  Yesterday he threw over some heavy shells.  At exactly midnight terrific crashes broke forth.  All our guns fired at the same time, some having been connected together so that they would go off at the one moment.  Fritz got an awful introduction into the 3rd year of the war.  The guns hammered away for hours in intense fury.  We got no rest at all.  This morning there were 4 casualties to carry down.  A few more shells came close to us during the day.  8th Fld. Ambulance have moved from the Brewery to an unknown destination &amp;</p>
