This was the place you will remember where the Ambulance was billeted before the big Advance.  Our packs were stored there, & I had a few necessary articles in mine that I required. I had a good many miles to walk, & the souvenirs that I was carrying with me (three German Gas Helmets, two water bottles & a Fritz Haversack) soon became heavy, but, the thought of what was in front of me - fourteen days of cleanliness & comfort, kept me in good spirits & I did not notice the long walk. Now & again I obtained a lift in a lorry or ambulance car, part of the journey was done in a staff car. Eventually I arrived at the Wood at 11 p.m., looking very disreputable after the long dusty trip, & after living in dugouts for the last 10 days.  Slept in a lorry for the night, & naturally I slept very little, excitement I suppose was the cause of this. Very shortly after daybreak I secured my pack etc., & then looked round for some breakfast. An American aerodrome was situated nearby & at 6 a.m. I butted my frame in there & obtained some breakfast. Felt much better after a good hot drink etc. then I started off on the road again. This time for the Leave train, in & out of lorries again, & luckily I arrived at the station five minutes before the train started.  It was relief to be in the train & to know, that I was well on my way at last.
