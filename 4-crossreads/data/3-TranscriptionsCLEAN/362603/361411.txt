Australian Branch Red Cross letterhead B.R.C.S.Bulford5.4.17Dear Mum,This is Thursday night & I was going to the Theatre.  I have been trying to get out all the week but have not had the chance.  I should have been on my way to Grimsby to-night but My leave was turned down.  I may be able to go in a fortnight's time.  Mail closes to-morrow morning & we have only just heard of it, so it will be only a very hasty letter this time.  We have had lots & lots of snow, ice & rain, but I don't mind it a Scrap.  I was on Police Duty for 3 1/2 hours the other night & it was very tiring.  I am not used to marching up & down like a Picket on Sentry on the Beat.
