 Monday, 4 January, 1915 To-day is the last of our C.B. punishment, our fatigue duties all day in close sequence.  Every day there is now a court martial or enquiry in some of the regiments.  The sooner we are away from here the better.  Camp life is too monotonous for men eager to get to the front. 
 Our horses are losing a lot of flesh, owing to poor quality of the feed, rice hulls are mainly used it is called "bippur". 
 Tuesday, 5 January, 1915 First day after C. B. [Confined to Barracks] at night I went out of bounds for a good feed to a cafe called The Bord du Nile, - we sat down at a table and next to us was one of our officers &amp; the S. M.  I fully expected another lot of C.B. but nothing came of it, as the officers were out of bounds themselves. 
 Our work is real ambulance drill now, with the waggons &amp; transports complete.  The bearers have had some drill galloping out to wounds in sessions.  The qualities of the horses has caused much discussion, each man thinking he owns a Carbine so the officers are trying to promote a sports meeting.
