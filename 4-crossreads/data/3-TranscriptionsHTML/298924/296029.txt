<p>Sunday 16 February 1919<br/>Khamsin blowing.  R.C. service in Y.M.C.A.  We have a Priest of sorts attached to the Regt.<br/>Busy trying to carry on War History but I have only done one year so far.  Hope to finish on the Boat.  Leave not sanctioned until Brigade returns from Cairo.  He, Gen. C- is no friend of mine like old J.B. Meredith was.</p>
