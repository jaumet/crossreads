  
 Friday 27th Sept. 
 Yesterday morning we left Tincourt by train, & this morning I am writing my diary at a table in front of an open window which faces the hilly part of the village of Etoile. This is the village where we halted for a day on our way up to the offensive, and, arriving a little before the others because I was part of the baggage guard, I was lucky enough to  find  be able to hire a room at 5 francs a week. There is a sheeted, & eiderdowned double bed & other little luxuries which make the room a veritable paradise after the horror of the Somme country. 
 Being foolish enough to let the cat out of the bag to Garland (the W.O.) I am now faced with the possibility of an order from the Colonel prohibiting  the  sleeping in private rooms. I must try to circumvent such an order, I think, at least the room would be worth the money if
