<p>to France <strike>till</strike> about the 26th of this month &ndash; I am trying to arrange to spend Xmas here and will cable you with the glad news if I am successful. Sis is very much afraid they will send me back before Xmas and wants to hang the whole Army, but I think I will be with them for the festive day.<br/>Address me as usual 11th Bgde &ndash; Must stop now as its bed time &ndash;</p>
<p>With fondest love to yourselves and Pat<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Terence</p>
