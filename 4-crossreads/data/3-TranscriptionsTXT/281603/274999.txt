We were in the buses for a few hours & we passed through Amiens & got out at La Chaussie & then had to march a kilometer to Tirancourt were the school is situated in a big chateau on the northern bank of the Somme River.  When we reached the school we were checked off & shown to our quarters & next morning when we fell in we were told off in Syndicates & commenced our training.  At night we were able to visit Piqu  Picquigny a decent village nearby.  On Sunday leave was granted to Amiens & we went by train the fare being 21/2d  & spent some decent time in the city.
Our stay last four weeks at the school & during that time experienced some very cold weather.  Snow fell & a big freeze set in & we were able to skate on the small ponds on the bank of the river.  On Saturday evening the 27th of Jan. we left the school by motors & after a few hours rough ride alighted at the Anzac reinforcement camp Albert where we stayed the night.  We never go up till late next morning & it was very cold & after having a walk through the town set out for the battalion about 1 pm.  We marched all the afternoon & when about a mile from the battalion our officer called a halt & we spent the night in the 49th Battalion camp.  The major of this camp was very good to us for
