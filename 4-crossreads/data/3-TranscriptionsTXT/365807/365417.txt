 another piece of stiffness. Received Herks address the same day as I got     back   the news of Keith. His address is c/o Lady Braddon at Sunningdale. Well I'd only just come from there the night before. I stayed with Mrs Massy and Nancy. Both very well. Nancy very tall &amp; an enthusiastic golfer. Mr Massy has 2 stars in a Defence job of sorts. 
 Life is flowing on in the usual way in this town. It is the  most  ideal place for cadets who are after all only a kind of Varsity students &amp; who are treated in the same way. I am doing a lot of rowing these days. We race Hurford College on Wednesday  &amp; the excitement is reminding me of the old schools race. Then the trees are all   out   decked in their various shades of green and if you could only see the river with the trees &amp; the meadows &amp; the college barges on one side. Oh its glorious to be here &amp; I'm too lucky for worlds. Swimming also is in full swing. Altogether I'm having the time of my life. But its hellish to read the casualty lists &amp; think of being as it were inactive here. One hears cheering reports from France as to the morale of the troops but the general opinion is it will last still some time. Remember me to Mrs Ferguson &amp; Dorothy. 
 Yours very sincerely John K. Mant
