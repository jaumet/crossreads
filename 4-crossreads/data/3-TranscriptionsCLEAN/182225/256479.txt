DEC.   TUESDAY 26   1916
Fine & frosty. Exercising horses in morning & we had a full dress parade in afternoon. Had every-thing on & we looked like a second hand shop. Lord knows how we will gett on when we have to carry them all & every day. Went round & saw old Pat Rutledge in evening. He is a Lieut. in 23rd Howitzer Brigade now.
