  
 Gun drill - Quarters - Fire drill - Hoses run out - fore & aft - Pumps manned - Every man at his post - Buckets handed down & the hoarse voice of the assistant (indecipherable) & the sharp orders of the gunners - We are simply a fighting unit & so far as we go fairly efficient but we couldn't go very far - Our blue jackets come from all kinds of ships - Minotaur - Cerberus - Australia, Penguin, Protector. I went 'rounds' last night with the Executive officer - I had to crawl almost under hammocks which are slung everywhere - All the blue jackets stand to attention when 'rounds' goes by - My own stunt is-one-sick - I've made the S.B.A. clean up stretchers & put things in line - Tell Rawdon a flying fish came thro my port last night & fell on the floor - We play ordinary Bridge - for drinks mostly - but I wont drink before 7 pm  & this example is being followed - 2 or 3 in the eveg. wont hurt anyone - These officers are a clean minded lot & that's how they should be - We have 3 men of Devon & 2 of Hampshire besides me of Norfolk in the Wardroom -
