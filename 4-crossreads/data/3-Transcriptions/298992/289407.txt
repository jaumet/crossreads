<p>to a man who has only been back a day or two, and he said we could never have stood the cold. He was there whilst it was snowing &amp; raining, and he says it was almost unbearable. The Ghurkas suffered terribly, and could not get their boots on, on account of the frost bite &amp; swollen feet. Many were drowned in the trenches. They filled up (the trenches) and the men were too weak to crawl away. The Turks suffered also, quite as bad as our men or nearly so. I have just heard something a few minutes ago, which may mean we will be on the move very shortly now, though I am not certain, so if you do not hear from me for some time, you will understand the reason. I will probably send a wire as soon as we move off. With reference to what you wrote, about my cabling you in case of "emergency" (I suppose you know what "emergency" stands for in this case) I will do as you said, though I will have to be very hard up indeed before I will trouble you. I'm sure I will be able to get on without that, although as you say it would be a pity to be in England or elsewhere &amp; not be able to see the place.</p>
