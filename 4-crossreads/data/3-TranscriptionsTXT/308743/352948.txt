 5 April 1915 Monday 24 wks from home Revielle at 6. I've never experienced such a day for one of the Philmus winds sprung up at 4 oclock blowing right off the desert. They're called 50 dayers for they say that they blow for that period at a stretch. Dust! why we know what dust really is the horses are nearly stifled with it. To make matters worse I had to go to the Barrage (31 mls) to take an order to the 2LH who were swiming their horses there its a most beautiful place possibly the finest of its kind in Egypt a most beautiful bridge spans the river &amp; opens out into a lovely park about &frac14; of a mile long. I then had to go to Mena to visit the 3rd Troop on bus for PSM Latham. Got home at 2.5 in time for more dust. We live, breathe, sleep &amp; eat it now. Mail arrives at 3 I get 6 one from Nell &amp; the rest from home Bed at 8.30 
 6 April 1915 Tuesday 
 Revielle at 6.30 Stables as per usual after break I got on to the bikes &amp; gave it a thorough over haul. The Sergeants position in the 1st Reg has been filled by Billy Nelson. Got news yesterday that Arthur Fox killed himself whilst riding his J.A.P. Received a letter from [indecipherable] who gave us the exact destination of our chaps. Another mail arrives &amp; I get two more from Nell real beauts. Whilst shaving the morning I cut about two inches of my nose off with the razor. Bert Larkin asked me where I placed his towel &amp; in returning my head I ran foul of the razor. Heard that we are off within 14 days to Alexandria &amp; to go into Barracks. Toby has been appointed to home defence &amp; is going crook some &amp; J Shaw likewise. Spend the evening reading &amp; writing letters Bed at 9.10 pm
