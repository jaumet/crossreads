<p>Gallipoli Peninsula</p>
<p>19.5.15</p>
<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>I reget to have to tell you that your son has just been killed in action. &nbsp;A battle started at 12 midnight and lasted till 10 a.m. &nbsp;It was a furious shell fire and our men stood it well. &nbsp;Your son was a gallant soldier. &nbsp;He has done splendid work and I have specially reported him. &nbsp;It is a great loss to the battalion and to me personally. &nbsp;I grieve for you and Mrs Street but you wil be proud to have given him in the cause in which he has done such splendid work.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>R. H Owen Lt Col:</p>
<p>late 3rd Batt: ........ 1st Infantry Brigade</p>
<p>P.S. &nbsp;We gave them a good licking. &nbsp;They were in great strength and came boldly on at first.</p>
