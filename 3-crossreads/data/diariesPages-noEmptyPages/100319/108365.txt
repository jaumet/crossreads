13/9/18 Cappy
A good deal of rain fell during night and the morning was showery. Brigade telephoned that Sports were postponed so I arranged for the specialists to have a morning after their own hearts. Smith was among his Lewis gunners Hughes with his signallers. Put different people on the job of building sheds and making other improvements round the camp. Since our arrival we have made a great change in the look of this place.
14/9/18. 
Went to D.HQ and sat with Colonel Ralston and others on a F.G.C.M. We tried Major Packer 105 How. Bty on various counts mostly connected with paybooks and passed sentence. Attended Bde Sports in the afternoon and we won a number of events ? especially the field race but crashed on the tug of war.
