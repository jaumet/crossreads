<p>trench being really formed by what was called the "dug out" also built up of Sand bags with an iron roof protected also by Sand bags, forming a small room for men off duty to rest &amp; sleep. On the outside of these "dug outs" a line of duck boards ran the whole length of the trench for easy walking.</p>
<p>The parapet was about 10 or 11 feet high with a fire step of about 3'.6" to 4 feet from the ground running the whole length of the "bay". Each trench had a receptacle for all the rifles with bayonets fixed, two receptacles for bombs, one for ammunition, with a large reserve stock of ammunition underneath the fire step. Also a periscope.</p>
<p>As soon as the men were all placed in the "bays" sentries were posted &amp; reliefs "told off" to do the work continuously night &amp; day.</p>
<p>As a preliminary all the men had to "Stand to" Every man had to take up a position in the bottom of the trench in "battle order" &ndash; &amp; this equipment is never supposed to be taken off while "in the line", whether awake or asleep. With his rifles (with bayonet fixed) at the "At Ease" position &amp; every man has to remain "Standing to" till the order comes to "Stand  Down" Usually the Stand to commences at about 3 oclock in the morning &amp; ends shortly after dawn and again just after dusk in the evening for about an hour.</p>
<p>This night "Stand Down" was given as soon as it was seen that every man was in his place &amp; understood his work for the night. Of course the sentries "on post" remain on the fire step Instructions were given that a continuous fire had to be kept up but firing was only to be done when a "target" appeared</p>
<p>When "Stand Down" was given most of the men waited patiently to observe how the sentries acted &amp; as soon as either one would be seen to be getting ready for a "shot" curiosity &amp; wonder became very keen. When the shot was fired, two or three of those below would at once whisper "What was it" "Did you hit him". My word! I hope you got the Cow!</p>
