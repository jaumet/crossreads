<p>boy to get all my odds &amp; ends back to the battalion. Came to this hospital (No 2 Stationary) in the Ambulance &amp; was put in No 5 ward after having a bonny hot bath. Can eat at this place. (Chicken etc) Much better than the school fare.</p>
<p>Friday 20.9.18<br/>Goods today. Guess I'll be up for a while &amp; should leave on Sunday in time to go back with the boys from the school. Four gas cases came in yesterday, 3 with eye trouble &amp; one with chest. Mustard gas it was. They got it near St. Quentin fighting with the Aussies. Hope our casualties were light.</p>
<p>Saturday 21.9.18.<br/>Got up in the afternoon &amp; went for a stroll over to No 3 A.G.H &amp; saw Sister Nicholls. She is some sport. Invited us to afternoon tea on Monday. Had temp taken when we got back &amp; sent back to bed 'cos my temp was up.</p>
<p>Sunday. 22.9.18.<br/>Very dopey today. Six from this ward sent to Blighty. Very lucky</p>
