6 June 1918 ThursdayMarch tonight Jalaat-Et-DummOnce more we go to the 1st line all night march back to the Valley-   We must stick it out altho' many think the 1st L.H. have done more than their share.  Had lunch in Bethlehem & saw a "Cow" being milked in the street with a stuffed calf put in front of her & carried along to next house.Had a "bath" & am all ready for the Heat, flies, & whatever is in store for us.  The men are all keen & a good lot but they've had a good time with the girls & are quite fresh after the change up here in the hills.
