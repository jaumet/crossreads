Tuesday 29/1/18Breakfast hurried affair - then donkeys & away to Alabaster quarries & how wonderful to see the pure white stone - some amber - rising out of the sandy desert & just the one field of it - in Egypt took 6 months for an oblisk to be got from here to Luxor (presumably).  Returning my donkey fell 2ce & I over his head, result, cut finger, strained elbow joint, skinned face & black eye.  Aust. soldier insists on my riding his "donk" back, hurried flight for train & so to Luxor the party of 18 Sisters & various followers go.  Major Mills & Milligan in our carriage (for lunch).  Luxor 5 p.m.  Arm seen by M.O., Bateson, put in sling, after dinner boat to Karnak & in the moonlight how grand it is.
