<p>25th<br/>Triumph torpedoed today by Enemy's Submarine about 12.30 p.m. &amp; sunk in about &frac12; hour.  Number lives lost so far unknown.  This is a heavy loss to us as she was doing splendid work on land Batteries &amp; has fired more rounds during war than any other boat in Navy.  Sub. still at large.  Other things quiet.</p>
<p>26th<br/>Making wire entanglements today.  Things quiet.</p>

<p>29.5.1915<br/>Early this morning there was heavy Artillery fire all along line - the enemy opening with heavy Artillery fire continuing till about 6 a.m.  On our Left Enemy attacked but were cut up after severe fighting with very heavy losses.   The 13th &amp; N. Zealanders eventually taking two trenches.  Our casualties are put down at about 200 while it is estimated that the Turks lost about 1500.</p>
<p>30th<br/>Enemy attempted feeble attack on Left Centre about 1 a.m. but were subjected to very heavy fire from our Artillery &amp; were easily repulsed.  Our boys counter attacking &amp; taking a couple of trenches with light losses while the Turks losses must have been very heavy.  Principle value of trenches gained was the fact that one was used by Snipers.</p>
