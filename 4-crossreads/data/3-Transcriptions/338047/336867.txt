Every man going on leave had to go fully equipped, with rifle, gas mask, and full marching order. The wisdom of this was of course apparent, in case of a sudden "push", men might be unable to rejoin their unit, as in the March stunt, and have to fight in hastily made up Battalions, as several of our men (returning from leave at that time) did. After dumping my pack I was just going for a walk when I saw a face I knew. He recognised me also &ndash; it was Jimmy Allison of Bathurst, who was at All Saints College with me. He had not seen me since I was 12 years old. I could not have altered much. I went out for a walk around the town after tea, and seeing some rather gaudy rosarys was going to buy one together with a crucifix as a souvenir, but changed my mind.<br/>Oct 23<br/>The next morning after breakfast</p>
