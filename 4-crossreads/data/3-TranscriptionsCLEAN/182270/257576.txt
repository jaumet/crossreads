SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1919.
Fine & hot. Turned all my horses
into wheat paddock in morning
Tickle lopped in Top paddock &
drew water for Darby. Al & Jo
went to Coomoo Coomoo for
the day. I went into QuIrindi
to go on to Taree re some
grass for the cattle but found
there was no train, so came home again.
