Supplies remainder continued Training. In March the Camp was moved to Zeitoun and there we found ample work without much training. However I persisted in them having a certain amount of Foot drill and Musketry. When first wounded arrived from Gallopoli I detailed a squad as Stretcher Bearers and orderleys at Heliopolis Hospital. Whilst at Zeitoun the Western Australia Quota of five men arrived from Australia and as we were short of men I put in a claim to headquarters and they were transferred to Bakery from Infantry reinforcements.
On 20 May 1915 orders were recieved to prepare to prepare for embarkation For Dardenelles on 22nd May. When 13th A.A.S.C. arrived in Egypt It was found that no Bakery equipment had been sent. The O/C had made a fruitless endeavour to get equipment through Abbassia headquarters and when he recieved orders on 28 Febuary. It was a rush round to beg, steal, or borrow troughs for making Dough and ovens to bake it. After a search in Cairo, a few ovens which had been discarded by Imperial Bakeries at Abbitors were procured but had to be signed for. (Tommy keeps a strict account of his issues. I always kept that in mind in the years after and it proved very useful. My books I determined would show a full account of invoiceReceipts and disbursements)
