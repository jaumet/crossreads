<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Plymouth I went up to London, arriving about 9-15 p.m.&nbsp; I went straight to the Y.M.C.A. Hostel for Officers and turned in; came down to breakfast at 9 a.m. Thursday, and as it was raining heavily did not leave the hostel until about 10-30 a.m. then riding upon the top of a motor bus went from point to point in London, shopping and incidentally passing most of the famous spots and buildings, for the different busses seem to leave no through street untravelled.&nbsp; Then back to camp by an early train, being will asleep before the return of the other troops to camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday being Saturday we had time to our-selves, but as I had to be in camp on Orderly Officer duties at 6 o&#39;clock, I could not go far afield with the others, so took a quiet strolll to Stonehenge, one of the wonders of the world.&nbsp; I&#39;d been reading the subject up and took a quiet satisfaction and intelligent interest in this, and also in the surrounding Tumuli or Barrows (prehistoric mounds or graves.)&nbsp; Yes, I walked to Amesbury last evening, making about six miles down the Avon valley through West Amesbury and Welsford and back over the Salisbury Downs.&nbsp; During the early part of the walk we saw the prettiest cottages that we have noticed yet, and during the letter portion traced on the downs the course of &quot;The Cursus&quot; outlined by ditches, this is believed to be the scene of the old Roman Chariot Races.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Love to all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold Peters.</p>
