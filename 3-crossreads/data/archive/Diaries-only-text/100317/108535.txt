the excavation and our H.Q. details are dug in as usual round about. Round the corner two cookers are dug into the bank and there is cooked the food for the men forward ? altogether I have just under 400 here. The day was quiet and hot as Thewlis and myself set off on our rounds. We cut across crops and grass to what was once the Railway station and here we found Sparrow in a concrete pillbox bunker in the building. Talked here for a time and then walked along the railway to where Keith Anderson had his people. The smell of gas was very distinct here with its mustard oil smell. Found Anderson evacuating his headquarters and shifting the men on account of this shelling. Leaving him we cut across to near Treux. The Boche had 3 balloons up looking directly down on us
