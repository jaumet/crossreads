 wanting to get a word with him first on the telephone. Saunders &ndash; J.B's (W.B.C.) nephew is in the A.S.C. that do for us, &amp; one of my chaps Macdonald Lt at the wagon line told me he was asking about me &amp; I have  sent along for him to come to dinner.  I have had several guests from a little way back amp; am afraid have not done some of them too well as just at the close of twilight when pipes are going sometimes Fritz sometimes [h]as light the sky up with flashes &amp; bangs &amp; they can see themselves involved in a young Verdun even when it is two or three miles down the line.  One night I had two Doctors up &ndash; one fellow who came over with us from Alex to Mar[seilles?] - &amp; I heard after that they arrived back with very awestruck reports.

We have all growled &ndash; except Miles apparently who it seems preferred to be Brigade Major! &amp; I think there will be a stir up.  Hang it all a cove wants promotion in his turn unless there is a very good reason why a junior should go over &amp; in this case absolutely none. 
 28/6/16 Postponed till today.  I can still catch the mail by sending a cyclist into the town about 2 miles away.  Gen. Hobbs came round again this morning.  All our new pits &amp; telephone switches working &amp; he reckons I got a model Battery &ndash; so it is &amp; they haven't just got pussy gun pits but can shoot.  I had another note from Dolly O'D, she said Gerty H was just tearing away to catch the boat as her mother was seriously ill.  I hope it does not prove so serious.
