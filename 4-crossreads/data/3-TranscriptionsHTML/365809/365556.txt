<p>Dear Mother and Father,<br/>My latest stunt is Golf. I went out yesterday with Beiers and his missus and am going out again this afternoon. Beiers plays quite a good game. My game is appalling but I like it and think I shall try and play regularly. Mrs. Beiers is a most charming woman speaks fairly good English a very pretty French accent. She is also (as Beiers says) as pretty as a picture. The Beiers I can tell you are a dashed handsome couple.</p>
<p>There are a good many officers wives living about here much to the envy of the Australians who happen to have wives in Australia.</p>
<p>Do you remember Major Morrison whose wife was a daughter of Syd and Florry Lee's he is here in the same mess with me He is always talking about his wife and her distant relationship to me.<br/>Rochford has gone up to Scotland for the week end.</p>
<p>I just received from France the remains of a parcel addressed to reach me at my birthday. I told the Adjutant to open all parcels and send me the sentimental parts and distribute the balance. I received a tin of Watson "B" feathers, a belt and some socks. The rest was duly appreciated by the chaps at the Battalion. The tobacco is a great luxury.</p>
