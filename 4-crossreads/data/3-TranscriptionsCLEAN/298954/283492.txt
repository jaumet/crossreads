  
 1917 Thur. 28th June. In Tasman Sea steering due West.   Beautiful weather, a smooth oily sea - several smoke-clouds on horizon. 
 Our food is now quite insufficient - the boilers have been "broken down" (so our hosts say) for the last week and our principal meal consists of the wet dough mis called bread, a little butter, black coffee and a minute dole of "Mrs Crippen". 
 Tue. 3rd July. The mines were brought up early - the whole of the rail under the poop were filled preparatory to laying a very big field.   The horns were all in position.   At about ten pm. the mines began to go over the side. 
 31 had been laid when an interruption came.   Those under the tube declared that a torpedo was fired - at any rate the "Wolf" suddenly started off with many mines still on the upper rails.
