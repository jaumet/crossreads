<p>3<br/>at Ghezireh I saw Beatrice Russel-Glasson. Poor girl she had had an attack of Scarlet Fever &amp; by good luck got there the day they allowed her out for the first time,  so I took her out for one hour's drive &amp; then to Groppi's &amp; over to the Hospital &amp; I think she liked it. There are only about 3 of the old officers at Ghezireh &amp; 20 of the old orderlies.<br/>I suppose you know that Col. Martin is now a C.M.G.<br/>Got a great surprise the other day here. Who should turn up but Arthur Colvin with whom I went to The King's School &amp; was in the same class for Latin Greek &amp; French! He got his degree some years ago &amp; is of course a Capt.</p>
