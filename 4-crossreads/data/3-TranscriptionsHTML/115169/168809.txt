<p>ships company.</p>
<p>July 2nd  at 8 am we dropped anchor some distance from Demerara, the river being far too shallow to allow ships of any draft to proceed further, - the town could be seen some distance off and leave was given, a tug being attached to our ship for the purpose of conveying liberty men to and fro. The town was rather interesting and posessed a very strong sea wall as the land in parts lay lower than the sea level</p>
<p>We had some enjoyable trips here and were entertained by the inhabitants to concerts, and race meetings, but this was our first visit to this place and we did not stay long, the above enjoyment taking place on a subsequent visit &ndash; Our captain landed with despatches and returned in revenue cutter "Arispainia" and we left at 11 AM.</p>
<p>July 3rd  at 11 am we arrived and anchored off Trinidad in Port of Spain, this was a very nice looking place, with great high ranges of hills all around and covered with pasture</p>
