<p>were going round that he had been either killed or captured.<br/>We reached home at 5 a.m.  Bullets were zipping past us as we walked along the road, they have an uncanny sound as they snip by.  Baptised a lad this evening.</p>
<p>Tuesday<br/>We did not get up very early.  I did not go to the Trenches today.  We went to the Hospital.  A shell fell on Houplines road wounding four men.  Arnie was only a few yards away riding down to the Canteen.  He was greatly scared at the time &amp; I don't wonder.  It is a cruel sensation to hear a shell coming at you.  This afternoon went to Cemetry.</p>
<p>Wednesday 23rd<br/>Went to Trenches &amp; cocoa stall.  They were shelling Houplines.  It is a bright day but bitterly cold &amp; still frozen.  I had three burials today, lads who were killed on <strike>Sunday's</strike> Monday's raid.<br/>I buried two German bodies also.</p>
