Dear old Man,Just a wee line as we may get a chance of sending a mail when we get in to-day. I have very little news to give, even if we were allowed to give news; I have plenty of opinions&#151; mine and other peoples &#151; but they are all too incendiary to risk in a letter. Suffice it to say that apparently we might much better be swinging round our buoys in Farm Cove as we would be just as much use &amp; much cheaper to run. We are just finishing a10 days trip at sea -- the longest, I think, a destroyer has been at sea without a break &#151; and are rather tired of the Pacific swell &#151; which at times is distinctly not pacific. We have been cooped up in our little tin dish for 2 1/2 months now practically without a break &amp; one begins to wonder what it is like to stretch ones legs a bit; no one would mind if we were likely to do, or were doing, anything to excuse our existence, but at present we are a mere excrescence on the scheme of war &amp; that is not pleasing. I think you could hardly realise our behaviour unaided, and as I can't very well write you all about it -- it would be horrid lese majeste while the show lasts -- I am writing letters occasionally &amp; enclosing them in an envelope addressed to you, so that if perchance -- which seems improbable -- I go out &amp; the ship still lives you may yet hear of our doings &amp; marvel at them. Truly we may say, with the sick man of whom you may have heard, t!we have left undone those things which we ought not to have left undone, &amp; we have done those things we ought not to have done, and there is no health in us!.Well old man , I'd give a bit to have a few hours with you all again; I suppose it doesn't seem long to you people, but this last 2 1/2 months has been pretty lengthy to us. How's business? pretty slack I fear tho I hope not. We were just saying to-day that if we had been allowed to pursue a commonsense course which we asked for &amp; suggested, and which was refused us altho we were doing nothing at the time, even my share of our prize money would have been about 8000 Pounds; as it is we should get 3-400 Pounds. In the meantime pay is slowly accumulating as we get no chance of spending. By the way, I suppose it is unneccessary to mention that if, owing to the temporary depression, you get a pinch on, anything of mine is at your service when you choose. Which you may consider like my hide, but I hope we know one another well enough to avoid that. Our wheels are still turning around; we did about 7000 miles the last two months; not very much but its the constant patrolling &amp; readiness for sea at any moment which makes the strain. How are all your people? give them my love, I wonder if I will get a mail when we get in this morning. I have had no news from home in the last two mails; your letters I have got from Sydney, you must tell me more about your people &amp; our mutual friends in Sydney next time, I keep wondering how they are getting on and what's doing in the land.What a hell of a time the poor Belgians have got! I'm disappointed in the Rooskys though. Has the expeditionary force left Australia yet for Europe? who of ours went with them?Cheerho! I'll probably have scales &amp; fins &amp; sweat oil when we meet next as we live on tinned herrings &amp;c. Yours ever
