 May. 22nd.  Arrived at Colombo at daybreak to-day &amp; all troops had shore leave.  I drove round all day in rickshaws, cars and "garris" and had a most glorious time. More than ever Colombo impresses me as "paradise"   Expect monsoonal weather now.  Leave at 8 p.m. again   "Karagola" expected to-morrow.
