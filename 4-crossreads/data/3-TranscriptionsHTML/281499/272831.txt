<p>set in a clump of nice trees there was a fine old castle, I could have looked on the beautiful landscape for hours, &amp; I was so wrapt up in France, however I was brought back to earth by a basket of French cake &amp; biscuits being thrust under my nose by a little French girl, &amp; these were very welcome for I was very hungry.<br/>The Major let us rest here for nearly &frac12; an hour, he recognised the beauty of the place, &amp; gave us the full benefit of it, from here the road led down a pretty steep hill into the town itself, where the French or should I say the Flemish people were all out to see us march through their pretty little town</p>
