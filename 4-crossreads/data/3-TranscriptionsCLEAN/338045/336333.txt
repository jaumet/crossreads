  
 sunny day, but cold winds.  We (A.M.C.) are "duty company" for the camp to-day.  Plenty of work.  Whole camp struck, tents & floors rebuilt.  I have parties working at this all morning.  Parade 2 p.m. & after putting line picquets on have little to do, but look round occasionally.  Bitterly cold night & am fortunate in securing another blanket from Sgt. David, an old A.I.F. Hdqrs. friend (now 1st Anzac Hdqrs. & in camp here).  Write letters in Sgts Mess until 8 p.m. & turn in. 
 Expenses - Cigs. 8c.
