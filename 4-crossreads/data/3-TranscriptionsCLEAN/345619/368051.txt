  
 [Reverse of the above postcard] 26-5-18 To dearest wife Am putting the last of my English cards in here, also colors off my old coat for the kiddies, the other little thing had better be for you, as I can't cut it in half for them. I will start today and write a bit each day in my pocket book, just like a little diary of things I won't be able to write to you from France. Your husband OXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX
