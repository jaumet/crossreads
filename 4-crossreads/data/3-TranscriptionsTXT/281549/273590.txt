 END OF PART 1 
 P.S.S.  The trip over on board the Troopship Ceramic, was, on the whole, very pleasant, My Reinforcement was allotted the best position on the boat for comfort &amp; easy travelling, Our quarters was the old Second Class dining Saloon &amp; it was situated right amidships.' 
 We slept on hammocks which were slung to the ceiling at night above the tables, And at day time they were taken down &amp; rolled up neatly &amp; placed in the crates provided for the purpose &amp; are thereby kept out of the way. 
 I was on the water for 45 days altogether &amp; was not sick during the voyage. The Ceramic is a very good sea boat in rough weather.
