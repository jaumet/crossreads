<p>We went for a route march through Etaples and Paris-Plage to day, and saw something of each place.  The former is quite a small town, and of no interest, but Paris-Plage has much to recommend it.  There are numbers of fine private residences, country homes &amp; sea-side houses of the French aristocracy.  There is a charming park, with Golf-links and pretty walks through the pine forests, which show up now, since all the other trees are quite bare.  There are several "Hospital militaire Complementaire"  (Nos 35 &amp; 43) which are crowded with French &amp; Tommy wounded.

On several occasions the french women, girls &amp; kiddies, ran down to the line &amp; sold us coffee &amp; bread, at fabulous prices too.  That will serve to show you how fast the train moved.  Everywhere along the line was evidence of whole heartedness with which France is in this war.  All foundries were going strong with girls working like men.  The women were in the fields.  Old men were on guard at crossings &amp; other places, leaving all men of young age for the firing line.  Hun prisoners are working everywhere with a scanty guard with fixed bayonets standing amongst them. But Fritz knows when he's well off, &amp; doesn't worry.  They look at us going up to the line, with an</p>
