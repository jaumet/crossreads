An extra prize of 40 Francs worth of canteen dry goods was added to the Hut Prize today. Our hut pulled it off again. So I was set up for an enormous spread. My feet are quite alright again. Have returned to duty.

The alarm sounded this morning at 2 A.M. Turned out "toute suite". A big disturbance in the line. Our fellows attacking, found many of Fritzs positions unoccupied. Thought he had gone home, hence the excitement. A squadron of cavalry went by at a gallop while we stood by our arms; waiting till they had located Fritz. They found him, he was not far away. Then we went back to bed. Stood by all day. Was Paid 20 Francs.
