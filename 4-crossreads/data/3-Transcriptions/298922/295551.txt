<p>[This page crossed through.]<br/>Wednesday 29 August 1917</p>
<p>An Australasian JUNE arrived &amp; no doubt letters are following. Am afraid many of mine were sunk in the MONGOLIA. On the Range again. I found a Reinforcement who had <u>never loaded or fired a Rifle yet</u>. One of the men took a snapshot of me shooting in a GAS MASK, not easy as a mist covers the eye pieces from breathing.</p>
<p>No news yet re leave. None of the family ever complain about the increased cost of things or servants etc. I know your PENNIES can't go far these days &amp; you are all doing your BIT.</p>
