<p>nothing happened and we managed to get into a compartment<br/>with only a solitary civilian occupying it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    It was with very anxious hearts that we waited to hear the rumbling of the train over the Rhine bridge, after which we knew we were not only on the right train but that our  biggest barrier had been passed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Unfortunately the train switched off in a different direction to our intended destination, but we were lucky enough to hand in our tickets to some lady porter (who was probably thinking of her "Fritz" at the front) so that we were not questioned at the station we got off at.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From the weather vane at the local church we conveniently got our direction and immediately set about making good the twenty kilometres that were not included in the course we had set ourselves.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We walked until eleven o'clock and then adjourned for breakfast &mdash; continuing on through open country, occasionally passing a prisoner of war working on the numerous farms.<br/>Keeping to the main road we were passing through a small village and unceremoniously ran into the village "cop" (who from the census of the Government knew the business of the district to , the number of eggs laid by each fowl).
