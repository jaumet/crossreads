I lay down then for another snooze, but was soon awake as I could hear the chaps talking as they watched two Fritz 'planes up very early, & a couple of our old slow scouts came across. Our chap sailed slowly through the air with a Fritz 'plane on top of him, & it looked a million to one on Fritz. The Hun swooped down on to the tail of our machine, & ours quietly turned the tail upwards, poured in a few bullets from his machine gun, & to the delight of our lads watching, the Fritz 'plane went crashing to the earth.

The green slopes between look lovely covered with yellow flowers but the black & white smoke of Fritz's bursting shells
