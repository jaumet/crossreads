<p>getting behind.<br/>The hospitals are constantly full &amp; men are coming over every day in scores.<br/>The housewife is finding things very bad just now   We are only allowed 2 oz of bread per day- potatoes once a week (Fridays) &amp; sugar is only seen on very rare occasions.  I have repeatedly seen a queue of 150 women waiting at &frac12; past 6 of a morning to buy their ration of bread, margarine or meat as the case may be.<br/>Oh! whilst I think of it Father please.  Instead of paying my Military Allotments into Barrack St Bank will you please arrange for them to be paid into the Bank of NSW (H.O) &amp; remitted to my account at the London Office of the Bank of N.S.W.  I haven't drawn on the a/c yet, &amp; I want the whole lot to come through on to the one a/c.<br/>I am keeping very well but the side occasionly aches especially if there is a change in the weather.  I tried last Monday week to get back to my Unit in France without having to go through the various depots in England but after a medical examination they put me down for 1 months home service in England so I'm bothered if I worry my head about them any more.<br/>Did I tell you that Percy Limn had a very serious attack of V.DH a few weeks ago &amp; for days <strike>they</strike></p>
