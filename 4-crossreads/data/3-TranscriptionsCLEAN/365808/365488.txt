  
 In Hospital  Sunday 1st July 1917  
 My Dear Judge, Your two letters of 18th April (from Melbourne) and 21st May have come to hand. The latter via America, in three weeks ahead of any other letters I have received from Sydney. No one else seems to be able to catch an American mail and, as you said, the ordinary mail is very irregular and uncertain. I was very glad that you had had news of Keith as satisfactory as could be expected - though in such matters news seems to be invariably vague. I have written to him and expect to hear that he is convalescing at some English country home where he would be bound to have a good rest coupled with any amusement or entertainment he might want.
