[Thursday  January 20 1916]
Returned yesterday to the Desert with a Truck of Baggage as far as Wardan- expect it will be sometime ere I leave again for civilization.The Bedouin Arabs we hope to fight are nomadic Tribes from the deserts, with one or two seaports on the Mediteranean  These towns are just Oasis with a population of a few 1000 living on Camels meat Fowls, eggs, barley etc  The tracks across the desert are shown by stone cairns & the Camel padsA few old Roman cisterns contain water after rain.  One spot we saw 2 native women making Butter in a Goat skin.
