Nothing eventful occured during the night but the fun started at day-break for we could see Germans all over the place, we grabbed our rifles into them we had quite good fun for a good hour dropped a fair number of the Huns, I know of one I accounted for Len got 3 more they had evidently been out on a working party had left it too late coming in so we socked it into them, it was dead funny to see them toppling head over heels ducking in out of shell holes as our bullets whistled past them. I first saw the Huns just as day was breaking I was looking out towards their trenches when something grey moving caught my eye. I guessed what it was straight away got all the boys ready
