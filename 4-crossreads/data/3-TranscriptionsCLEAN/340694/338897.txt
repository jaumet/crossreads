  
 12 as I washed in. There's not too much fresh water about the place. 
 A lovely cool night, will use the blankets to-night. 
 Received 5 letters after tea Ruth Eva Hobden, Dorie, Charlie McNamara Trish. Ruths contained the news of Doss's wedding, it was dated 5/4/16. 
 21/5/16. A quiet day yesterday, Rodger & Bill called about 3-30 & I went down for a swim with them it was great. After tea they came across & we went down to the canteen & had some peaches & milk, quite a feed. Received a long letter from Doss telling me of the wedding. 
 It is pretty warm to-day & the flies are busy. 
 Sunday to-day it's like all other days here.
