 heavy and unbroken fire from artillery and mine-throwers that it is 
 not safe, and often it is impossible, to go out even at night to 
 bring food and water.&nbsp; It is impossible to depend on telegraphic 
 communication with the rear being maintained, so often are the wires 
 cut and so dangerous and futile is it to repair them.&nbsp; It is this, 
 that has led to a revival of carrier pigeon communication, not for 
 long distances, but as the only dependable medium of communication 
 from the front to the rear, a matter of a mile or so.&nbsp; As a means of 
 communicating with our artillery we found them most useful and much 
 more reliable than the rocket method of summoning artillery support. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the stretcher bearers, and the Red Cross workers in 
 the advanced posts, every one has nothing but admiration.&nbsp; The 
 stretcher bearers go about their work with an utter disregard for 
 danger:&nbsp; they have their job to do and if they are killed, well, it 
 can&#39;t be helped.&nbsp; Their own personal safety is the last thing they 
 think of, all their thoughts being centred on getting their man back 
 out of the danger zone and to the dressing station.&nbsp; Providence 
 seems to watch over them.&nbsp; Time and again I have seen a stretcher 
 party coming down a sap or down through the gully leading back to the 
 dressing station when a shell or two would burst what appeared to be 
 right amongst them.&nbsp; You would wait for the smoke to clear xxxxx 
 xx expecting nothing but a bloody mass of human remains to be 
 revealed, when out of the smoke would emerge the stretcher party 
 quite unconcerned - they were&#39;nt hit so they don&#39;t even trouble to 
 look round and see what the shell did.&nbsp; Such luck, however, cannot 
 always stand by them and on one occasion I remember seeing by the 
 roadside the remains of what had been a stretcher party - three bearers 
 a patient and a stretcher, the last sacrifice of the stretcher bearers 
 and they make many.
