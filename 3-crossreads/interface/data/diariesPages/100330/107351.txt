supper, two Eggs Bread Butter Coffee for 1 Franc which was fairly reasonable considering the times, on coming along the road back to Camp we saw Fritz having a lively time from the Air Craft Guns he was making for the town but was driven off, shots flying around him everywhere he turned made off up towards our Camp, still being chased by our Guns when it got too hot for him, he turned off made for his own lines, we arrived back at Camp where everything was quite turned in. Tuesday 26th/6/17. Fritz awoke us up at 3 am with his usual visit but although he dropped several Bombs near by he did no damage, Fritz with his big Gun was quiet all day I signed on at 8 Pm to take up Amunition for the Guns, we left here at 9.30 Pm for Pottonhook Siding after a quiet run we arrived there at 10.15 Pm after picking up a Construction Gang in case the line is blown up. We remained at the Amunition Dump while the Boys unloaded the trucks, as the Shells were unloaded stacked they were covered over the leaves
