If a person should want any beer he must order it direct from the brewery & get it sent to his private house for private consumption. Spirits you must send to Quebec or elsewhere for it & that also is for private consumption & not for retailing out. I believe there are here as in Australia places where it can be had sub rosa but if the vendors are caught the fine is heavy and in some cases imprisonment  for six months.The weather here just now is delightful but prior to our arrival it had rained for weeks. In winter it freezes from 10 - 30 %[Degrees] below zero but also rains a good deal during the summer.At present there is plenty of work & skilled labour is paid for at the rate of above 11/- per diem of 9 hours.Yesterday another boat joined us the S.S. Carmania. We are being delayed getting another cannon fixed up on our stern the one we had being too small, also one forward on the bows.
