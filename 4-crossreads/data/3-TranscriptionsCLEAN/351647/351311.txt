  
 it may be in the nature of reopening a old wound.  But I hope not.  I always liked Mr. Bettington & admired him tremendously & he was always so jolly good to me that I feel his death more than I expected.  It is a case of the old order changing for I'm sure there are only too few of his sort left & after all it was him & his sort that laid the foundations of Australia.  I hope Mollies wedding goes off all right & that the trip does you & Graham good.  Mother said Guy had taken a house next to my Aunt's.  It has a nice garden.  When does Peg get married.
