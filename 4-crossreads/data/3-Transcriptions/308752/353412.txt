<p>old trenches &amp; of course as they day was clear Fitz kept sending his coal boxes over. The A.M.C. details at the dug-out were good chaps, on our return we found a glorious cop of tea, &amp; a hot meal prepared for us. I don' think that I ever enjoyed a meal as this one before, our first decent meal for 5 days. I noticed without one word of a lie that the ice in the numerous shell holes was over a foot thick."   I guess shes some climate, believe me. We were not called out during the night our good luck still continues. All slept like a top, not even the roar of guns disturbed us.</p>
<p>January 30th 1917</p>
<p>We all slept so soundly that one of us were awake until 9.30 a.m. Breakfast was soon prepared &amp; was much enjoyed, bacon, cold meat, bread &amp; butter, &amp; a good cup of tea. At eleven oclock a rush of patients took place, our squad was kept going till darkness set in. A couple of times we were obliged to carry right through to No 4 Post as the men stationed at the Relay Post between the latter &amp; our R.A.P. were working like britons, they also had a rush of patients. The distance to No 4 was about 2 miles, a long carry.</p>
