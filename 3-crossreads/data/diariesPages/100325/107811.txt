Early parade. Fell in battalion and then came in and had breakfast. Went to Cairo to draw pay with Corporal Be Boos. Very pleasant morning passed canal on way in ? full of nude men scrubbing down donkeys. All the cemeteries full of crowds like meetings - Mussulmans celebrating Bairim. Went per gharry to Pay Office drew pay cqe. Returned to Bank, had long wait there. To Kasr el Nil barracks. Very animated South Nott Yeomanry moving out for Gallipoli, 21st Battn going in. 
Rumoured Australians all round Achi Baba and cut off Turkish supplies. 5th Bde. sailing for destination unknown. Think Suez to relieve AAC. Are we going to Citadel Peculiar to see the women being taken out to the fields on kind of lorry. Narrow lorry crowded with black shrouded figures squatting down ? like nuns. Man walking along side driving the donkey. A great many new Australians roaming round Heliopolis. Just arrived ? no helmets no salutes! Great many fat men in tram no waistcoats They have their trousers cut very high up so they button over paunch. Gives them funny look
