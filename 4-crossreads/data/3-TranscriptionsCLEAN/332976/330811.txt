  
 March 1917 13th.   I have still got the five parties working & have got through a considerable ammount of work. Fritz has been shelling heavily all day in the vicinity of Needle dump & has done a fair bit of damage.   Another two of one of the parties were killed & another had his leg taken off, & last night one of my sappers in charge of a party got shell shock. At about 2.45 P.M. our artillery opened up another heavy barrage lasting about two hours, but Fritz was not slow in retaliating & we nearly had our "cook house" blown to blazes.
