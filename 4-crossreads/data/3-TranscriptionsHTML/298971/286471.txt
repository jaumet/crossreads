<p>train of wounded after tea.  Orders for marching out tomorrow.</p>
<p>21st November (Tuesday)</p>
<p>Commenced our journey in motor ambulances but were held up on the road so had to continue on foot, packs being carried on the waggons.  Arrived at destination Bernafay Wood and, after erecting tents settled down for the night.  The ground is soaking wet, a bad place for tent accommodation.  Huge naval guns were firing late into the night and some shells from Fritz landed</p>
