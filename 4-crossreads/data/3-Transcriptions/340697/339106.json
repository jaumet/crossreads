<p>set fire to a hay stack but otherwise no damage was done. Our artillery fired thousands of rounds 26.4.16</p>
<p>The enemy artillery are putting a good many shots around our billet and it feels anything but comfortable. 27.4.16</p>
<p>Some more howitzer shells at our billet today but they have failed to hit it yet "Fritz" put up a notice last night stating that Kut had fallen and 13,000 prisoners taken 30.4.16</p>
