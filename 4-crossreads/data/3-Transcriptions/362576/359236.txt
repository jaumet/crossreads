<p>lately.  We are just preparing for the winter.  Men who have been here thro' a winter say they have never been so cold anywhere.  The rains come in about a month but we had some a few days ago, the 1st for 7 months.  It makes the ground like the Black soil of N.S.W. &amp; you cart away half an acre on each foot.</p>
<p>I have just started to use the scarf you gave me &amp; it will be a very precious possession through the winter here.</p>
<p>I see they have got a new Head at T.K.S. [The King's School]  I am jolly glad as I never thought Waddy was the man for the position in spite of all the booming he got.</p>
<p>Am asking Montague Stephen to forward this letter as I forget your address.  Wishing you a merry Christmas &amp; a happy New Year.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>C.A. Verge</p>
