<p>some 12 inchers in some guns those<br/>All around here there are shrines &amp; its wonderful how they have escaped the shells you will see the shrine standing up amongst the ruins of houses &amp;etc &amp; scarcely touched they seem to bear a charmed life somehow, some of the shrines are placed like an altar at the end of a small little room &amp; the effigy of our Lord or Mary is surrounded by flowers &amp; candlesticks, &amp; inside the little hut are placed chairs for one or two people to sit &amp; say their prayer's, most of them are very pretty these of course are Catholic turnouts for that practically is the religion of France though Protestantism is fast gaining ground, other shrines are nailed to trunks of trees, or let into the sides of a house, &amp; then again you will see them often at the cross roads, some</p>
