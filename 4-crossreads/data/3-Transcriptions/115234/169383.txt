<p>(A Child&#39;s Shoe)</p>
<p>=====&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; ===== &nbsp; &quot; &nbsp; =====</p>
<p>Mute &quot;pathetic relic&quot; from out the peaceful past</p>
<p>What memories awaken, of the one who wore thee last</p>
<p>&#39;Round you my vagrant fancy, a story sad doth weave</p>
<p>For a little kiddie owned you, &#39;Tis easy to perceive</p>
<p>Just a baby&#39;s tiny slipper, lying all forlorn</p>
<p>Amid the scattered debris, that was once a happy home</p>
<p>Yet you speak of tears and laughter, baby prattle, mother&#39;s love</p>
<p>While you shriek aloud for vengeance to <u>He</u> who dwells Above</p>
