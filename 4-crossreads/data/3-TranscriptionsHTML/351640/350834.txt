<p>no doubt as to Col MacLaurin, Lieut. Col Braund, and Sgt. Larkin having been killed, but there has come no official confirmation.</p>
<p>From information received it is probable that the letters and papers, which should have come to me from you during last week, have been sent by mistake to the Dardanells.   An official thinking that all Australians had left Egypt, sent many bags of mail matter to the fighting area.  It is not likely that we shall never see them. However, we can hope.</p>

<p>Last evening I presented myself with a birthday present.  A bunch of violets cost 2&frac12;, they are in a glass at my elbow as I write.</p>
<p>I am betting myself 6d that a cable will come from you today arriving here at a time of day which, when compared with the hour of dispatch, will be several hours ahead.   The dots and dashes will have raced the sun.</p>
<p>The Shakespearian of quotation this morning is:&ndash;<br/>"Cheer your heart<br/>And let determined things to destiny<br/>Hold unbewailed their way" A &amp; Cleopatra iii &ndash; 6.</p>
<p>Yesterday when passing a bookshop in Cairo, I stepped inside and asked for some Shakspearian plays.   I found</p>
<p>[Sergeant Edward Rennix Larkin, MLA, of Milsons Point, Sydney, enlisted on 21 June 1914 and embarked from Sydney on 18 October 1914 on HMAT A19 Afric with the 1st Infantry Battalion, 1st Brigade. He was killed in action at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.]</p>
