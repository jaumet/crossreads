<p>snack for tea then had to turn to &amp; load camels waggons etc, pack blankets &amp; kit bags.  Slept that night in one of the waggons.</p>
<p>Saturday 13th May<br/>Reveille at 2 A.M.  Had a cup of tea then finished loading camels waggons etc but were late in moving off owing to same bad management.  Marched out of camp about 4.30 for railhead, due east into the desert about 8 or 9 miles being the end of the railway.  Here we relieved the 8th Field Amb. who straight way marched to Ferry post to take over our quarters.  The day was extremely hot &amp; one wonders how much longer we will be kept on the desert.  Late in the afternoon we had to erect two large marquees for a batch of 70 patients from the trenches.  A very irritating part of our business is the incompetence &amp; cras ignorance of most of our "officers".  One in particular when we arrived here made us a perfect laughing stock with the infantry by the insane orders he issued.  Tis not much encouragement to the men to learn their work when the officers will not learn how to give the most</p>
