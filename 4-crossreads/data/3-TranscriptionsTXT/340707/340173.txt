 To describe Versaille is impossible &amp; God knows what kind of intellect it was which fashioned it. It is stupendous &amp; cost about &pound;20,000,000 &amp; has accomodation for 10,000 inmates The approach has 16 colossal statutes perhaps 20 ft high of statesmen &amp; soldier of Louis XV &amp; in the centre is a statue of the Grand Monarch himself. Each of the pavilions are inscribed with "To the great glories of France" but this is probably by Louis XV 
 The Broad Avenue de Paris is lined with thousand of blue clad, steel helmeted cavalry who are guarding every road. The Palace itself is out of bounds save with a ticket which I do not possess 
 The grounds are one complicated mass of tree covered avenues &amp; thickets &amp; shrubberies &ndash; with temple &amp; fountains &amp; sculptures every at unexpected places Over 100 sculptors were employed embellishing the grounds 
 At 10 to 4 the battery of artillery commences. This is signal that peace has been signed &amp; then plenipotentiaries file out &amp; into the terrace &amp; simultaneously the fountains commence to play &ndash; &amp; a majestic sight they are though big ones are not in action
