  
 Sunday 20 April 1919 Dusty all day. Went out to St Addresse [Adresse] with George & stayed there till train time. Did all sorts of things with the boy. Played cricket etc. sang, played cards & ate. (The easiest of the lot). Was supposed to be on Special patrol. Did it out there. 
 Monday 21 April 1919 Train strike today so didn't go into town. Went & dug Dad Hunter & after lunch we went & had a look at a game of football 'tween 4th & 5th Div.  5th won by 4 points. Went to a fancy dress & masked ball at the Gym. Went as Bo peep. Some scream too. The show was excellent. Some lovely costumes there. Enjoyed it immensely. Supper too was good. Finished at 2.30 am, but I hopped  off at 12. No work for me at all today.
