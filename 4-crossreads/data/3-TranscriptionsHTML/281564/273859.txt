After tacking about the island all day we again set sail (NW by N) &ndash; a fleet of thirteen composed of the Battlecruiser "Australia", the cruisers "Sydney" "Encounter, T.P. Ds '  "Warrego","Yarra" &amp; (God bless a civilised name) "Parramatta", Submarines AE1&amp; AE2, Troopship "Berrima"(<u>third class cruiser</u>) storeship "Aorangi", an oil vessel &amp; two colliers. To see us manoeuvring about one would think that we were out to take Japan instead of New Pommern &ndash; our rumoured &ndash;destination.</p>
