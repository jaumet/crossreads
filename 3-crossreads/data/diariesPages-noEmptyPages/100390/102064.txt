My Dear Viva Pater Mater all.
We are on the eve of disembarkation en route for Mena, down the Nile
Of all the wonderful things Ive seen I can at present only hint
The trip thro the canal lined with 30000 Indian troops The wonderful procession of ships laden with troops passing thro the canal for 6 weeks without a break 5 miles apart
The harbour here with literally thousands of ships. Ships as far as one can see for miles packed like the Vic Dock. Prizes of the war sheltering vessels. My trip
