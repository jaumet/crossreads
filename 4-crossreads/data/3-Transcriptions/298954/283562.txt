<p>1918<br/>Sat. 2nd Feb.<br/>The ship presents a beautiful picture this morning.</p>
<p>Decks and hatches are deeply covered with snow, spars, rigging and ventilation are outlined in white;   thick white flakes are falling so fast that the lead-covered waves swelling away on our beam are only visible for a few yards from the side.</p>
<p>Snowballing is the order of the day.   At mid-day the fall ceased and the guns had scarcely been cleared of snow when &ndash; the alarm went!   Something was in sight coming straight at us and our Hun hosts really thought that they were about to get "It" this time.   The ship cleared for action, [indecipherable] Hans almost had a spasm and we sick were marched down into no 2 hold.</p>
<p>The miserable procession of partly-dressed sick prisoners was bundled out and down the hatch into the hold.</p>
