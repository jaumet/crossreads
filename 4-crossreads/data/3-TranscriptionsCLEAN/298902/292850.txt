Tuesday 21st Jan.  Very little doing.  Weather getting cooler.  At night dinner to Snowy St Clair who was going to Aussie, very successful & I was fooled for a speech.
Wednesday 22nd Jan  Snow again, the second time this winter.  Took photos of the mess, yesterday doing the same when they were all in the costume we used at the evening.  Also had mine taken with the lady of the house.  At night we farewelled Joe Davis a S/Sgt with us for 2 years, a dentist.  Very successful night, I was fooled for the speech again.  Having several games of pakapoo nowadays, a mild card game of interest.
Thursday 23rd  Freezing hard.  Had a snap taken with myself perched on the motor bike.  Sent car for Dados and Baths' stuff.  Everyone preparing for a fancy dress dance, some good costumes being prepared by the lads.
