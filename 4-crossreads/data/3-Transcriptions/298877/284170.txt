<p>Wednesday 30th Dec. 1914<br/>Still anchored in Albany, a few of the lads put off today as medically unfit. Some of the boys caught a few fine fish this afternoon.</p>
<p>Thursday Dec. 31st  1914<br/>New Year's Eve sailed out of Albany at 9 A.M. a grand sight it was to see the 16 Troopships sailing in one long line, as far as the eye could see. At present we are steering in N.W. direction, where we are going none of us know, the only escort we have seen so far, is a Submarine, but no doubt there are some Cruisers close handy.</p>
<p>Friday 1st Jan. 1915<br/>We had a concert on board to-night, it was a great success. One of the lads on the Persic was consigned to a sailor' grave to-day, we all slacked speed just while he was cast overboard.</p>
