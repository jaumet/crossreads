<p>Sunday 21 April<br/>Particularly quiet on the front all day. Glorious day &amp; there has been much aerial work.  Our post is just under the shadow of the Mont des Cats. Two stretcher cases from the line.</p>
<p>Monday 22 April<br/>To-day has been very hot round our Aid Post &amp; Fritz has shelled us all day.  He obtained one direct hit on our house &amp; wounded one chap fairly badly.<br/>A very heavy bombardment on our left. I think things will be quite warm about here in the future.</p>
