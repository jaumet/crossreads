<p>France<br/>3rd. May 1916.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 29.6.16</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Since writing on the 25th ult. I have received quite a big batch of mail from Australia.  Among it were 5 letters from you dated 27.2.16; 1.3.16, 5.3.16, 5.3.16, &amp; 6.3.16 also one from Mother dated 27.2.16.  Thank you both very much for your very welcome news.  I have also received a pair of sox that you sent out to me.  I have any quantity of these in hand just at present but they will all come in useful sometime or other.<br/>Things have been much the same since I last wrote.  There is in fact very little to report. I am expecting to get 8 days leave for London pretty shortly now, &amp; as soon as I know definitely I will send you a cable asking you to send over some money.  The cable will be<br/>{"John Waterhouse, Chatswood, Sydney.  Cable Ten Commonwealth Bank, London, furlough, well, love, Leo Waterhouse France."}<br/>I hope this won't give you any trouble, Father dear.  I don't know a soul in London or England for that matter but I want to have a good look round whilst I am over</p>
