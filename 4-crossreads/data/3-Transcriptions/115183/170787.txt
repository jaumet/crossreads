<p><u>Tuesday 23 November 191<s>7</s>6</u>. This is a memorable day in many lives, including that of your humble servant. For on this day we left Eng for the front. Reveille was<s> about 3 am</s> at 3.45 am, breakfast at 4.30, and the &quot;Fall in&quot; sounded at 5.45. No one was absent. At 6 am we moved off and marched the&nbsp;three miles to <u>Amesbury Stn </u>with our packs up. It was fortunately a nice cool morning. By about 7.30 we had entrained with all our transport horses and waggons. We were not delayed long and by 9 am had made a quiet train trip through <u>Southampton</u> down to the docks where we disentrained &amp; unloaded our packed waggons onto a covered shed by the wharves.</p>
<p>We were then marched to another covere<s>r</s>d wharf and here, in company with a large number of our infantry, &amp; some men returning from leave, we spent the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>Fortunately there was a canteen</p>
