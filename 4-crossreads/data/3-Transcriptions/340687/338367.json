<p>March, 1917. 2nd in Lent. Sunday 4<br/>Set out with heavy packs at 8.30 &amp; were lucky to commandeer a truck near Clark's Dump &amp; pushed out to rail head at the Abbey (just below). Sunny day with frost &amp; keen wind so we had to wait till dark as the bank. Hexham Sunken Road was right under observation. Butte de Warlencourt in front and guns on it audaciously. Le Sars in front further. Set out at dark and travelled over very rough ground to Yarrow Bank &amp; thence per rough duck boards to old german trench this side of Le Barque. Dugout two entrances with 3 short drives where we sleep. Bed at 10 and did 1.20 gas guard. Not much room. Cook our own food. Fritz 1100 yds on far side Le Barque 1000 yds from here which is under snipers fire.</p>
