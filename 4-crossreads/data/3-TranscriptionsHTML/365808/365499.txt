<p>SENIOR OFFICERS' SCHOOL,<br/>MALPLAQUET BARRACKS,<br/>ALDERSHOT.<br/>9. 7. 17.</p>
<p>My dear Judge.<br/>I am attending the above school which lasts ten weeks. I can well imagine the delight of my people on receiving my cable to that effect.<br/>I have seen Keith. We had Lunch Dinner &amp; a theatre together on Saturday. I was greatly relieved to see how well he was looking. Really the only trace of rough handling noticeable is that the pronunciation of a complicated word like "Buckingham Palace" causes him some difficulty. He always manages it after a couple of attempts and he tells me that his difficulties of speech are rapidly</p>
