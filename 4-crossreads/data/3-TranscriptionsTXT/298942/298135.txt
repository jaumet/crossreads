London.
During his sermon on Ascension Day he made very definite statements regarding a Heaven which is not far away, but a spirit world all round us.  I felt it very keenly in the bright spring sunshine, despite the warlike appearance of two bulging observation balloons & the shells bursting a few hundred yards away.
The fact we are simply material flesh & blood actuated by personalities is very clear to me now.  When one does the personality survives & becomes a member of the spirit world.
