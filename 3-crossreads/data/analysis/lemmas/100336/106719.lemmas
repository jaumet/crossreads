 depend on . We tramp on as best we could expect that if we struck good hard travel we could reach the coast the follow night . About midnight we struck a fair good road but it was not lead in the exact direct to suit us so we had to leav it and strike off across the boggi field again . We did not make much further progress owe to a terribl rain storm come on , so we took refug in one of our usual place of conceal . There was absolut no timber in this part of the countri . The follow day it was still rain . We began to see the terribl possibl of failur . Near all day we discuss the situat and came to the conclus that if the rain did not stop it would be imposs to reach the coast at our present rate of travel In the afternoon the rain clear up and we had hope of be abl to continu the trip with success . We could see Tarsus in the distanc and knew by our posit that we would still have about 13 mile to do . We had gone about 2 mile when anoth terribl rain storm broke and it was not long befor we were like drown rat . We stop for about 1 hour in the hope of it clear off , but no such luck . It seem as if it was go to last . We knew that with the small amount of wet biscuit we had , we could not possibl do the trip . After reach the coast we had a 4 to 5 day trip . At sea we could not possibl stand the strain of this without food . We ate the remain biscuit and decid that we would start back to camp befor ani of us becam sick to walk . Cullen had a slight attack of malaria and we did not know the minut we might all be stricken down with the same complaint . We had been wet through practic all the time for the past four day . I think the onli thing that went a long way to keep off a sick was a bottl of Dr. Colli Brown 's chloradyn which one of our friend had given us befor leav in case of dysentri . He had receiv it in a parcel . We took 20 to 30 drop of this everi night after we finish the night march and we found it warm us up wonder . We left all our gear in a wheat field where we were , to be found by who ever should reap the harvest . I have often wonder sinc what the man who found it thought it was , if it was a Turk , I am sure that the mysteri is still unsolv for the Turk is veri ignot outsid his own littl bit of farm work . We set off back reliev of our heavi burden but how we felt it have to leav our boat behind which we had spent month of work on and had depend on it get us out of that terribl countri . I still fell sure today that had the rain kept off we would have reach the coast and got safe across to Cyprus , an English possess . There was nowher where we could leav the boat and come back in a month or two and find it for the countri was all the same and the night were pitch black . We would not have found the same place again especi a wheat field .
