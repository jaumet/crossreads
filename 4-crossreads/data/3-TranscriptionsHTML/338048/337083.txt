<p>&amp; remainder of streamers. Sea calm and passed through Heads about 6.30 p.m.</p>
<p>Dinner &amp; <strike>of</strike> tea on board of first rate quality being 3 courses. Prepared bunk early so as to get a good position. Room soon becomes a maze of ropes &amp; canvas as soon as hammocks are erected. Slept very well <u>and comfortable</u>.</p>
<p>Sunday 28th<br/>40 min behind Melbourne<br/>Up at 6 a.m., rolled up hammock &amp; began to feel funny, so hurriedly finished &amp; got up on top deck and there improved. Later went down for breakfast, came up for air half time &amp; then returned. Sea fairly calm slight roll. Church parade at 10.45 p.m. Time different from shore time as we are running away from the sun. Lounged on deck in afternoon. Sing-song with music after tea &amp; then arranged hammock. Went out on deck for an air and then turned in &amp; slept well.</p>
<p>Monday 29<br/>Time 1 hr. behind Melbourne time<br/>Boat rolling slightly when waking and soon went up on deck for air. Uniform left about owing to hurry, buried at bottom of hammock bin. Parade for physical exercises 10 a.m. Parade with life belts on at 1-45 p.m. Buzzer practice then commenced but sea too noisy. Sea becoming more choppy but boat not effected. Awings were fixed up today with big canvas tubes fixed for diverting the wind into the "troop deck" where we sleep &amp; eat &amp; which are rather stuffy. Rain expected. Sea rougher in evening &amp; became seasick. Slept on hatchway.</p>
<p>Tuesday 30<br/>Lost time during sickness<br/>Stormy high wind &amp; waves, felt funny all day &amp; was sick pretty well every time after going below. Had all meals except tea as I was violently sick at the time. Speed of boat reduced owing to storm. Only about 20 miles travelled during day.</p>
