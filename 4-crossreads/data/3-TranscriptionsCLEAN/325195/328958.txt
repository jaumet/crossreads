1.10.15Fri 1st. A good deal of bombarding in the region of the Narrows, it is reported that Monitors are gradually forging their way through but we get so many false rumors one does not know what to believe: Had a swim today & it was glorious; some of the boys have been in the habit of bombing fish but it is now forbidden & anyone caught in the act soon finds themselves under arrest not for killing fish but for wasting ammunition; 3 old sailing vessels were captured from the Turks &  brought here & beached a few days ago, they are very old & only fit for firewood. A supply of wood is being brought here to put us over the winter months.
