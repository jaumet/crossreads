<p>for it.  Very hot day.  The Tommies are arriving to take over so expect we will make another move in a few days.</p>
<p>Friday 2nd June<br/>Early reveille as usual &amp; then company drill in the morning.  I was put on to drill being a section commander for the morning, but flatter myself that I carried on O.K. considering that 'tis nearly 18 months since I had any practice in giving orders a very different thing to carrying out the orders in the ranks.  Had two good swims during the day &amp; a lecture in the afternoon.  Made up some more parcels for home, mostly photographs.</p>
<p>Saturday 3rd June<br/>New orders out once more.  We are not allowed to take our black kits to France, a very wise thing as 'tis merely a huge waste as we keep a lot of clothing lying idle causing lumber &amp; extra transport etc.  The pity of it is that they wait until we are issued with two complete kits then immediately take them away again which means an awful waste both of clothing time &amp;</p>
