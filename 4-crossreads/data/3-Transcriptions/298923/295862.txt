<p>15 July 1918 Monday<br/>Marched in on foot to Breakfast at 0600; lost a few men coming in from Shelling-  Our Camp is under direct observation from Turks guns-  German prisoners say Turks did not cooperate altho' "they" the Germans kept the Turks without much Water for 2 days to make them keen to attack &amp; get it from our Wadi:  NICE!<br/>Busy collecting war material &amp; burying dead.   I lost some of my best N.C.O.s   The German wounded suffered greatly from thirst but as the Red X is always fired on &amp; shelled by them it is their own fault.  <strike>Shows how much a man knows in WAR-  I was wrong in thinking we had the "WIND UP" unnecessarily.</strike></p>
