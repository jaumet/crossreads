 Sunday 9 Wet &amp; miserable. 
 Monday 10 Beautiful weather 
 Tuesday 11 Beautiful day. A dinner tonight was very decent. Rumours are about that we move back to the line at Messines in a couple of days

 Saturday 15 Move to-day at sunrise to Senleques via Samer for Reserves. A beautiful day &amp; a decent march
