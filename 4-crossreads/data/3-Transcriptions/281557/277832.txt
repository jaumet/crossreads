<p>Friday Jan 14th<br/>A very calm day : Revellie 6 am : our Coy on guard but I did not strike it at first but was put on at 10 am &amp; my post was the hospital : Handed one blanket each in to be sent to our camp It cost us 1 &frac12;  pence each for carting but it was better than carrying them. The 1 &frac12;  pence each also included the carting of our rations. No physical after tea. No land sighted : passed more steamers : Sighted a lighthouse about 7 pm on the African side. The night turned on rather windy &amp; cold Slept on deck during 4 hour spells could not get to bible class</p>
