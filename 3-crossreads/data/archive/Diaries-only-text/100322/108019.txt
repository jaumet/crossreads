Fairly quiet morning fixing up small matters. At 2.30 paraded Freddy Co. round to General Tivey. In the presence of Genl. Martin he gave them a good rating and they all then went home. Bill May came over during the afternoon and had some afternoon tea. Word of further drafts 14th 21st and 28th. Ellwood goes on leave to the Rhine tomorrow. At mess of an evening now we get about 15 officers all round one table ? a change to other times when 30 to 40 would at one time sit down to dinner. The bonne at this house is a perfect slave going day and night. No wonder many prefer the streets to this kind of economic slavery. Took a tour round the Old Town before dark ? days are longer now.
