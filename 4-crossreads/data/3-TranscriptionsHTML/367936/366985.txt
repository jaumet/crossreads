<p>Monday 29 May 1916<br/>Land on both sides all day.  Very rough mountainous sandy country.  Fearfully sharp peaks.  Passed Mt. Sini [Sinai].<br/>Saw where troops landed near &hellip;<br/>Country very pretty at sunset stretching away peak after peak.  Pity this country is not in Australia.  Govt. would settle Returned Soldiers on it.  Water fight in evening.</p>
