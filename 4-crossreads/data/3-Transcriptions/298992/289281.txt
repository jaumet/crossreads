<p>S.S. "Moresby" Voy.102.<br/>At Sea, 18th Sept. '14</p>
<p>The Manager,<br/>Island Department,<br/>Messrs Burns Philp &amp; Co. Ltd.,<br/>Sydney.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The "Moresby" left Butaritari at 5 p.m. on Saturday 5th September and made for Tarawa, where we arrived 1p.m. on the following day.</p>
<p>The Schooner "Polenia" was there when we arrived, and came alongside at 6 a.m. on Monday, to take over some trade which we did not have time to put aboard the "Tambo" at Butaritari.</p>
<p>Captain MacLeod transferred to the "Polenia", Captain Handley bringing to Sydney the "Moresby".</p>
<p>We had 8 Passengers for Tarawa, vis: Mr Workman, Mr. Fowler, who was relieving the Engineer of the "Polenia", a Chinaman and 5 Natives. I collected from Mr Workman  &pound; 6 &ndash; being ;pound 1 for his own passage and &pound; 5 for the passages of the Natives. The Chinaman was also charged &pound; 1.</p>
<p>I have to state that as there is no Ticket Book aboard the "Moresby", no tickets have been issued for these passengers.</p>
