<p>Wednesday 20 Sept. 1916<br/>Everything underfoot was fearfully wet &amp; slushy but there were only a few driving showers during the day. Went round battalions in the morning &amp; in the afternoon stayed inside for Leo's visit. Most crops of hops have now been harvested, also chickory : maize sown in drills 10" apart is abt. 3'6" to 4' high &amp; being used as greenfeed.</p>
