Air brakes are not in use on the trams &amp; it looks queer to see the guard winding up the hand brakes. But for all that they do not threaten to kink one's back like Sydney trams do. The customary trolley pole with a wheel is replaced by a wide bracket: - [diagram]<br/>that runs along the line wire &amp; makes a perfect imitation of rusty machinery &amp; sparks like a roman candle. The guage is very small indeed, but the trams can deal with the small traffic.</p>
<p>The Policemen who stand at the crossings are a smiling lot &ndash; like alderman on a holiday. They are mostly big, stout men &amp; wear a helmet with a metal badge large enough to hide behind. Their knowledge is good to middling as generally they admit with their smile that they "Don't know".</p>
