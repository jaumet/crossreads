<p>[Note at the top of the letter transcribed below &ndash;<br/>By same mail I am sending a photo for "sweethearts at home" or "the gallant medico on active service"  W.H.R</p>
<p>[The next two letters are out of order]</p>
<p>No. 2 Gen Hosp.<br/>Mena<br/>20.4.15<br/>Dearest old Mrs,<br/>Your cable received re leaving by Warwickshire in 9 days time please let me know what port you disembark at &amp; I will endeavour to get down to meet you.   We are not very busy just now &amp; I think I can manage it.  As stated in my last letter you must be prepared at any time to hear of a change in our movements necessitating you cancelling your arrangements &ndash; I don't think it is likely to happen but it may.   There will be no difficulty in getting a house or flat but I will do nothing in the matter till you arrive.   Nestle's food can be procured without any difficulty &amp; costs about &frac14; per tin.   There is only one variety to be had in Egypt &ndash; the label says "suitable for young children" apparently they do not have the under &amp; over 6 months foods.   There are plenty of other foods if this is not suitable for the little man.  Bring plenty of<br/>money &amp; get Arch to send more if necessary &ndash; I want you to live well over here. Please thank Trix for her letter of 1st inst. which arrived only yesterday nearly a week after yours of same date.   She should address her letters <u>properly</u>.  No more time for any more news &ndash; feeling A1 &amp; longing to see you all.   Best love from your loving husband<br/>Will</p>
