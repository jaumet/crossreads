Feb.6th  Frank & I went up to Suzanne's in the morning to learn a little bit of French. there was a family of three Mother & two daughters aged twelve & fifteen respectively  Suzanne & Lucienne & Suzanne, they used to keep open house to the soldiers & sell coffee at 1d per time. they always had a warm fire & a smile for the boys & we appreciate a place to spend a few dull minutes round the home fire - Joe went to Blighty on leave. I went to Meteren in the afternoon to see Jack as it is his birthday - Coming home at night I caught up the fellows on their way home all boozed & walked with them - they had been stopped by the Military police in Bailleul but had given a good account of themselves & got away -
 
Feb.7th  The bunch are feeling a bit dopey after last night's jolification - Bud went to Blighty on special leave to be married - Frank came on with me as second driver as Jim is in hospital in Blighty & expects not to be back again, thinks he can work it for Aussie.
