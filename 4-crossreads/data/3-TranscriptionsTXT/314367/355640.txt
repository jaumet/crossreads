The talk on shore was local - They had no news - you remember a missionary being badly beaten by some Germans including a German Doctor at a plantation on this island some weeks ago - The culprits were arrested - Corporal Ellis - AMG - saw the missionary - He dressed his sores - He was badly beaten - Well - 4 of the culprits were stripped & publicly flogged in the square at Rabaul - Every German was compelled to be present & hear the sentence but was not compelled to witness the flogging - The Dr got 30 on his bare buttocks with a rattan cane the others 25in in diminished ratio - the least guilty was flogged privately -Serve them quite right - It was a just punishment - That will protect Britishers in out of the way places. This spot Kawieu is the capital of New Ireland - Some 30 well built houses & stores - an hotel - closed at present - Fine promenade along the beach - Casuarinas flank it on both sides & give great shade - There is a good breeze -
