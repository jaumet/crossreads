 Friday 19th May Big sick parade nearly all dressings owing to septic, all tiny scratches turn septic. We were cut short of water to-day, and I had to do my dispensing out of my own supply. The 5th LH alongside us cannot understand me carrying the stuff I do, and dispensing in the firing line but I have a fine supply and it is an untold blessing. The 1st LH went through to Romania to-day. The rest of the Brigade is at Hill 70. A Bedouin prisoner was brought in during the day. Every man was out building the redoubt up under our great working old Colonel. 
 It was a very favourable night for an attack and full precautions were taken. I posted my A.bs and some men in different redoubts and put first aid boxes in each, but the attack failed to come off, as we expected and we stood to arms at 3.30 am to 4.30 am. 
 Saturday 20th May Fine cool day, every man working strengthening the position. During the night two of our treacherous Arabs with camel corps sneaked off to meet some Turks but our patrol grabbed both parties, we four letters happy in spite of evics. Big bombardments in vicinity all day. Had to man trenches again at night.
