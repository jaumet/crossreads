<p>Sunday 7 April 1918<br/>The Hun shows no sign of coming on again.  But expect he will as there is nothing between him &amp; Amiens 'cept <u>us</u>!!</p>
<p>Monday 8 April 1918<br/>The Brigade has dug well in and the line is more organised.  We have only six guns behind us but they try &amp; do the work of sixty.</p>
<p>Tuesday 9 April 1918<br/>Everyone on the Q.V. as reports say the Hun is going to make a final attack to get Amiens.</p>
<p>Wednesday 10 April 1918<br/>The threatened attack did not come off.  The diggers are in good spirits and aching to get a shot at someone!!</p>
<p>Thursday 11 April 1918<br/>All the cows in Villers Bretoneux are taken care of!!  To say nothing of chickens &amp; other animals.  The village is not knocked about much.</p>
<p>Friday 12 April 1918<br/>We went up to Villers Bret. &amp; salvaged some blankets &amp; a stove to make our miserable lives happy.  Plenty of aeroplanes appearing.</p>
<p>Saturday 13 April 1918<br/>Saw over 200 British planes up today &amp; not one Hun in sight!  The 'planes were doing good deal of bomb droppg. on his front line trenches.  Also mach. gunning his troops.</p>
