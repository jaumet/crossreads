  
 may be a false alarm, but I don't think so. 
 Just received a letter from Father (27/3/16) and am sorry you have not received the negatives that I sent per "special messenger". Perhaps they will have turned up by now. 
 No time to write more now Mother, but I reckon 12000 Australians are equal to 16000 Turks any time - especially if its not a place like Gallipoli we have to take. 
 Am in good "nick" - and there is an undercurrent of excitement running all through the Camp just now. Everyone is wondering, expecting, and pretending to be perfectly calm, when all the time they can hardly keep still - itching to be on the move. That accounts for this waiting probably. Much love from Alan.
