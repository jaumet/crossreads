<p>Please post me a well bound Pocket book like this for DIARY. This will last till end of September only. Not far from here is a flat piece of couch grassed land, a pretty spot surrounded by Fig Trees etc.:-  at present an Aerodrome no doubt some day a Race Course or Polo ground &ndash; here are all sorts of planes DE HAVILANDS, Bristol Monoplanes, Vickers [indecipherable] Martinsides etc:  an alarm was given &amp; the way the machines came out was like upsetting a Beehive. <strike>At last the Tables were turning.</strike>  Our machines chased the HUN home. Stanley Braim is back in Cairo trying <strike>again</strike> for his commission so I did not see him. KEITH URQUHART I think is there, Rutledge has gone to England.</p>
