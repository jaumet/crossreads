<p>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>I wonder what Santa gave you this year. Suppose you are having a very Happy Holiday now. We had a great day with our poor wounded soldiers. They all had plenty of good things to eat   &amp;  drink.</p>
<p>We were very busy with preparing the decorations all last week   &amp;  then started to put them up on Sunday.</p>
<p>Heaps of love   &amp;  kisses</p>
<p>From<br/>XOXOXOXOXO Auntie Eadle</p>
