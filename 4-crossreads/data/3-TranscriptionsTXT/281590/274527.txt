 Nov 1916 trouble here, waiting re-equipping etc &amp; at 9.30 left for train, travelling in usual military fashion, goods trucks failing cattle trucks. Very cold, no blankets &amp; not sufficient room to stretch our legs out. However we are accustomed to this &amp; not at all surprised at it, in fact we anticipated it. However about 4.30 before daylight we got to Suez &amp; spent the next hour being shunted up &amp; down one or two sidings &amp; about daylight we pulled up near the pier The "port Darwin" one of the C'wealth steamers of about 8,000 tons. About 200-300 inf from France also waiting. Report vary saying 800-1200 aboard. Dave aboard too, also many old faces that I have not seen for years. Nearly all 1914 men &amp; a very fine class too. Very different to those met in brigades. Quite safe to leave
