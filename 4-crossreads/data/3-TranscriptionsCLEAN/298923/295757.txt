1 April 1918 MondayCarmilite Monastery BethlehemBrigade still away but expected back any day now-Church Bells ringing all night, punctuated by odd shots from the sentries to hunt Bedouins from our Camping area.  Cold & wet I am lucky to be in this job.  I told you I think we are in a Carmelite Monastery, I borrowed a Piano & at night the men have Concerts.  I got an Armenian Doctor who had deserted from the Turks to lecture on the Massacres the same man was opposite us at Quinn's & Popes Hill Gallipoli & is very interesting.
