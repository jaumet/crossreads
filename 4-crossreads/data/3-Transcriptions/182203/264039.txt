May 18th  1916<br/>My dearest Jane,<br/>Really I am ashamed of myself at forgetting to write to you in time for your birthday. Anyhow I hope you had a very, very, Happy Birthday &amp; lots of presents. Suppose Belle gave you mine &ndash; fancy I have been away for two of your birthdays now. I'm writing early in week, best begin when I have time. I wrote to Alice last Monday &amp; since then have had rather an exciting time.<br/>Monday-night I received a wire from my <u>beloved</u> saying he was coming by that evening's train to say Good-bye  leaving for France next day. So I got dressed  &amp; got a late pass from Matron, went to the station to meet him. Well, we had a sad but lovely time &amp;  returned to the Home before 11. p.m.  Matron was awfully good  <strike>indecipherable all</strike> to me</p>
