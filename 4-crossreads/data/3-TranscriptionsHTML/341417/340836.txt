<p>France<br/>28th August 1916</p>
<p>Dear Mrs McDonald</p>
<p>I regret exceedingly to inform you that your husband Captain W. T. McDonald was killed in action on the afternoon of the 16th August 1916.</p>
<p>He was in command of an important section of our trench on the left of the 4th Battalion line in front of Mouquet Farm and while seated close to the side of the trench the fuse of a shell struck him in the chest and death was practically instantaneous</p>
<p>He was lifted into a shell hole &amp; there buried by his men who also erected a small wooden cross on the grave to mark the spot.</p>
<p>The grave is near a culvert</p>
