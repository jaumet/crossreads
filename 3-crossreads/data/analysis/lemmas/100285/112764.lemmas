 the other they led us to a big stream 60 yard wide , here was a nice kettl of fish for the onli way of get across seem to be swim but befor we tackl this I suggest that we should go as far as the next bend see if anyth was in sight so we trudg along our luck stuck to us for there we saw 3 men clean the weed out in a punt I put it on them to run us across which they did so end an adventur afternoon , but all the same I enjoy myself we had a jolli good laugh over it on our way home I took a photo of the punt but I do n't expect it will be much good for the light was so bad . Was told this even by the order that I would be go on leav in the morn .
