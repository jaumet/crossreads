The trenches are an intricate maze & bear evidence of the patient & arduous work of the Sappers. From the hill, one commands a magnificent view of the Mediterranean sea ever still & opalescent. The "Triumph" & "Majestic" went down not far off. Destroyers steal literally in & out the bay & the guns of the battleships, shore howitzers, & field batteries roar in concert. Aeroplanes are active on reconaissance duty over the Turkish lines & I saw one pilot who ventured too low over the enemys fire. The shell burst within some yds of the machine but did no damage.

Re the 8th ALH. what pen can adequately describe the dread tortures of war the gallant body of 600 men have suffered. Thirteen to 15 weeks ago they entered the firing line with big & stout hearts, men in their physical prime & buoyant with enthusiasm & nerve in their work. Today they are a battered & torn regiment – they can muster about 200 whole men, & these are without stamina
