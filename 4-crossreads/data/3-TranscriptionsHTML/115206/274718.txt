<p>May 1918<br/>Tuesday 28</p>
<p>Battery W.Lines.<br/>Weather fine but fairly cool. Received a letter from Clar, enclosing some splendid snaps of the family. Also received a letter from "Toots" a beauty. <br/>Fairly heavy bombardment during morning.<br/>Wrote several letters.<br/>Help to complete construction of Y.M.<br/>Cleaned steelwork of harness.<br/>One or two fine air fights resulting in odds even over Corbie. 1 of ours 1 of theirs. Heard rumors of Fritz's attack up North near Lochre. Good news.</p>
