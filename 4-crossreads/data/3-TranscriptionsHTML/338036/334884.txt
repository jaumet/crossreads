<p>Friday 9/3/17<br/>Awoke to find beautiful sun shine but very cold.  Did not last long but became mushy as the day wore on with more snow.  An incident with a Fritz aeroplane created some excitement this morning.  An aeroplane could be seen flying towards us &ndash; very low and being fired at.  We did not realize it was an enemy aeroplane and just above the chimney stack in height.  Our anti aircraft shells were bursting very low &amp; a nose cap hit the factory wall just above our heads.  There was great excitement for a while.  It subsequently transpired that he was brought down near Armentieres.  The Germans bombarded a factory in Armentieres today killing 6 civilians &amp; wounding one soldier.  treated at our M.D.S.</p>
