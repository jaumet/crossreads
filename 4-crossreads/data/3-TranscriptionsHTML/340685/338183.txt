<p>One test alarm was given yesterday after tea and the officers were so disgusted at our slowness that they say the next one will be at 3 in the morning. We have also had one dress parade and to-morrow there is a medical inspection prior to our leaving the boat. There are supposed to be 4 cases of measles on board and we may be quarantined.<br/>14.5.16 Supposed to have a church parade this morning at 9. one for Presbyterians one for R.C. and another for Salvation Army. However there wasn't nearly enough room on the decks for everyone and we arrived late. Passed a small sailing boat this afternoon and we also have on our right what I take to be Sicily as I think we passed Malta last night. Our destination is still unknown but probably Marseilles <strike>as</strike> but however some cargo we have on board is consigned for Plymouth and we may go on to England. We have a man on board who was with the Engineers on Gallipoli and I had quite a long yarn with him yesterday afternoon and he seems a bonza chap and was the companion of a V.C. and D.C. man on the Peninsula. The islands we are just passing are Gozen and Malta. First named being a German concentration camp where German prisoners from all over the place come.<br/>15.5.16 Nothing unusual except bad food and we are getting used to that now.<br/>16.5.16 Fairly rough since yesterday. Only a heavy swell however and not many were sick. Weather is perfect and the boat excellent to sail in. Had to take a fatigue party after breakfast to clean up our deck. The stairways were very slippery and one man spilt the tea coming down and another the porridge and our nailed boots made everyone slide down unless very careful one poor man negotiated 3 steps safely and completed the rest on his back and hands. Had a full dress preparatory parade  at two to-day and prepared our dry rations for disembarkation to-morrow although we expected to leave the boat to-night. Our latest idea is that we are going to Shorncliffe in Devon overland to Calais. Our dry rations are bully beef, marmalade, condensed milk and a tin containing squares of oxo or beef extract sufficient</p>
