We called at this port for the purpose of coaling the ship, and the coal which was loaded by the natives, was brought out in lighters so that the ship might stop out in the Stream, preventing the soldiers from visiting the Town. The natives at St. Vincent are principally occupied in coaling vessels as there seems to be no vegetation on the Island.

<p>It was about 1.30 a.m. in the morning and very dark when we got into the train and moved off. On our way we passed through a town called Exeter, the Mayoress of which gave us Coffee and Buns, gratis. on the Station. I might say we appreciated this kind deed very much and I have to this day a card which is a souvenir of the occasion wishing me good luck and a safe return.</p>
<p>We, however, reached Salisbury plains (Aynesbury Station) at about 5o'clock the same morning, when we were confronted with the thought of a 5 mile march from the station to the camp. Those marching thoughts became very real in about 30 minutes for we were on the move. After our long idleness on the ship, we boys were very</p>
