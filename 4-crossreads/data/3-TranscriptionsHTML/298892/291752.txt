<p>I do not refer to Douglas's clan but rather to the unsophisticated barbarians fresh from Mudgee. I would not think of referring to Doug's learned colleagues in such terms, for fear he should retaliate and flay me with his pointed sarcasms. I would even risk this if I thought it would result in my receiving word from him.<br/>I have three souvenir belts.
