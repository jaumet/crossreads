<p>My Darling Eddy,  XXX</p>
<p>This is a funny old fashioned machine drawn by bullocks. The machinery here is not like ours it is made mostly of wood, drawn by bullocks, mules, donkeys or Camels, sometimes a bullock   &amp;  a camel. This is a very funny country with fields of corn etc. Hope you like the cards I send you. Your letters are lovely. Heaps of kisses   &amp;  hugs. From XXXXXXXX Auntie Eadle.</p>
