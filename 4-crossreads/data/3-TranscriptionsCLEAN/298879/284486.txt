  
 December 1915 Wednesday 22 Rifle inspection. We are all ready to move out of camp any time. We got our Xmas billies today one per man and they contained some very useful articles. 
 Thursday 23 Cool    Wind blowing from South.  We marched out about half a mile and the Col. gave us a lecture. He told us that since the evacuation at Anzac the Turks bombarded our front heavily and then charged. They swarmed triumphantly down the gullies and Navy cut them up badly.
