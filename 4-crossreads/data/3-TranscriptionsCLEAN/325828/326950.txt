  
 France          R 21.8.16 28th June 1916. 
 My dearest Father, The Austln. Mail closes again tomorrow, & I am glad, very glad that you won't have to wait for a month this time before hearing from France as I was thinking you would when I last wrote. I had a surprise visit from Wal this afternoon   It was only a brief visit as he was pretty busy.  He had come up from the line & I was very thankful to see him safe & sound.  I told him I was writing home tonight & he said to let you know he was in splendid health & keeping well.  He has been kept very busy with his work & unable to write as fully as possible It is raining again tonight & the weather here lately is just about ideal for ducks etc. rain mud, & slush, & then for a change slush, mud & rain, week in week out.  I suppose it is a soldier's privilege to growl though.  It isn't a bad sign when the weather is the only thing a man can find to growl at though.
