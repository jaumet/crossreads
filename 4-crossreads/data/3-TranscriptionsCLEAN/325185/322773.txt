He has been sent across to England with a crushed foot was ran over by one of the transport. Well the war news is very good lately isent it. So far I havent been in the late advances. Was up at the line when the Germens started to evacuate first. It was on the front we were holding that he first went back. Have another ribbon to place with Polziers, Bapume & if I am lucky shall have more before it is all over. Well I lost my stripes alright.you see my promotion hadint been confirmed before I went away wounded & I was away over the three months have been given one stripe again am in charge of a gun & hope before long to have the other one again. Oh you have asked a couple of times about the remainder of the Germen Helmet well I had to throw it away as it was getting so badly broke but shall get one and send it across the first chance I get. The mountings I sent across can be fixed to it. Have started another collection have a belt buckle & few buttens so far will make up a parcel later on & send it across to you. Well father there is no news to tell you so you must excuse this short note. Will try & write a little more often. Love & best wish to all. Your sincere son Clyde
