A guide was waiting on Cairo Rly Stn to meet us and show us where the camp was , on Tuesday after dinner two of us had a look round part of Cairo. There is much to see, in this place It is full of Bazaars and each guide who accosts you assures you that the Bazaar he wishes to show you is the only genuine one. We went into one, but did not like the look of the place, so turned and went out much to the disgust of the Proprietor, whose name I might mention was "Cohen" he followed us protesting that everything in his Bazaar was allright, and produced Police, certificates, etc to prove his assertions but it was no good we went on our way and did not visit any more bazaars in the evening we secured a couple of Donkeys and went for a Ride. there is nothing very exciting about a Donkey Ride in Cairo but you want to be a good hand at abusing the boys, who will not make their donks go unless you do.
