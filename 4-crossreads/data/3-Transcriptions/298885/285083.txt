<p>including a great number gassed.</p>
<p>Mon July 31st &ndash; 16<br/>Ordered to be ready to move out for a rest at an hour's notice and I can tell you we moved out in a hurry as Fritz found our position and sent over hundreds of "coal-boxes" (12 and 15 inch) all along Sausage Gully killing 10 men and wounding 36</p>
<p>Tues Aug 1st &ndash; 16<br/>At last we are out again and bivouacking a short distance behind Albert</p>
<p>Wed Aug 2nd &ndash; 16<br/>Another move again at 9AM and after a hot and dusty</p>
