I have never seen men fight and struggle as these men do in order to get there meals. It would be unnecessary if some of the officers would take them in hand and make them form a queue. It is not that there is not plenty of tucker, but more a reaction from all ranks against the late military restraint.
An indignation meeting held by the N.S.W. men. They object to go back on to the ship again, because if they do so, they will be quarantined again on reaching Sydney. They also make out that the ship is "chatty". Addressed by a young officer who explained away the grievance very well.

Embarked on the "Port Sydney" at three o'clock to-day.
In the forenoon the sea was very rough, but it gradually calmed down in the afternoon. We have had a splendid time over in the quarantine station, plenty to eat, nothing to do.
