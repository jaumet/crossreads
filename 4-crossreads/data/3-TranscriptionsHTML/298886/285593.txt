Same date<br/>"B" Squadron and Head Quarters are under the shade of the sheltering palms at QUATIA Since this morning the Turks have been driven back from their small outposts within several miles East of this position shots have been exchanged between the different patrols on either side one of our Squadrons has gone to Oghratina but have run into a "hornets nest" there and have received a temporary check in that direction.
