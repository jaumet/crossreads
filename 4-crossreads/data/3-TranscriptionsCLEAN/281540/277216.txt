12/10/15Blue dancing in breeze - cruisers standing off in line with Chessboard but out of range.  Quiet day as regards actual fighting but busy in other respects.  Some preparations for the little show that will take place any time now.  Mail arrived and all sorted - not a very large one but acceptable.  Great waiting for Canteen stuff to come, made place ready.  Only up fire trench a couple of times.  P. has no grip on his company.  Nothing doing during evening - a little rain.  To bed early.
13/10/15Stand to 0455 pitch dark & cold.  Carry on 0540. With Drummond for a swim alright in but deuced cold out.  Down and back in 3/4 hour getting into form again.  Sun bright this morning, but wind icy - all the waves flecked with white caps.
Little bombardment & bayonet bullet work today but our men are working like slaves taking tons of earth of the mines and drives and tunnels we are putting out.The earth is shot down chutes down the side of the hill and is gradually covering up one neat grave with head-cross.  It will be completely underground in a day or two and it will be one more nameless grave.  Our men are picking and mining like devils spurred on with rum.  The enemy we can hear doing the same as we approach they recede, then they are heard elsewhere and we have to countermine  no rest after one another all the time.  Mines ready laid for touch off but the ground between the trenches has under it hundreds and hundreds of yards of subterranean passages   [indecipherable] Bde HQ a dugout driven right in alongside a grave its occupant can only be a couple of feet away and on the other side are more
