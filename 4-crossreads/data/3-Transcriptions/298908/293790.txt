<p>As I was standing on the platform at Warminster a tall chap came up &amp; spoke to me he turned out to be Cliff Dickenson.  He is in the 12th Battalion.  I should never have known him.<br/>All sorts of rumours have been flying round tonight about Austria having surrendered to the Allies, it is supposed to have come through the Post Office at Warminster but this evening I was down at the Pictures &amp; they threw the latest war news on the screen.  "Nothing official about Austria yet".  "Germans beaten all along the line".  These announcements were greeted with much handclapping &amp; a running fire of remarks.  These are great times one never knows whats going to happen from day to day &amp; no one seems to be able to fathom old Foch's scheme.<br/>The boys are having a gay old time in the Mess tonight, a sort of farewell concert to some of the 1914 men who are going into No. 10 Camp tomorrow previous to going on ship.</p>
