We crawled on for about five hundred yards when we came on the first hedge marked on our map, and as we came to another hedge a flare went up from Aachen, to warn the border guards that some prisoners had escaped.   We lay low for a short time as the sky was lit up.   We had not crawled much further when I got camp in my legs.
