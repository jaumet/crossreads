<p>altho' they could have done it much better than we had to without any conveniences &amp;c of a Hosp ship. Have had 3 trips to Alexandria &amp; 1 to Malta as well as a lot of dodging about up here &ndash; have been on 10 or 12 ships! Now they have about 15 proper Hosp ships ready so we are no longer needed for sea work &amp; are expecting orders any hour to proceed to the front.<br/>The work has been rather interesting and exacting at times but the spirit of the wounded &amp; their pluck &amp; endurance wonderful. Do not believe any of those yarns re mutilation &amp; atrocities by the Turks &ndash; there have been many rumours but in spite of enquiries from all quarters so far no authentic case found &amp; no-one has come forward who could swear to having actually seen any thing &ndash; all rumours!<br/>We want all the physically fit (especially re teeth) men we can get &ndash; also a great number of Hosp and A.M.C. orderlies &ndash; have stacks of medicos. The 3rd Genl. Hosp with Geordie MacCormick, Norton, Jamieson &amp;c &amp;c have just arrived to open up here. Will realise now what we early birds have had to put up with &ndash; inconvenience, dirt, dust, heat, flies &amp;c!<br/>My best regards to Eileen &amp; the family &amp; yourself &ndash; hope you are all O.K. as I am &ndash; had poisoned hand recently &ndash; rather serious at the time.<br/>Best luck Yours sincerely<br/>H. Poate.</p>
