 Dearest Mother &amp; Father, I was glad to hear that you are all well. It is getting close up to Xmas. I am sorry to say that I will not be able to spend Christmas Day with Auntie. I have to stay here &amp; look after the Christmas Dinner &amp; New Year Dinner. We will have a good time I am getting poultry fruit nuts etc. There will be plenty of wine on the table. So I will not have too bad a time. My word it has been foggy lately. Isn't it rotten &amp; so cold. Today has been a glorious N.S.W day, beautiful sunshine, only there is plenty of snow on the ground still. I am still unfit for active service. i think the square heads will turn it up before six months. They can't stand the boys coming at them in the winter. Remember me to all my friends, as I am kept busy &amp; cannot get much time for writing Hoping you are all well best wishes love &amp; kisses Your loving Son Tom
