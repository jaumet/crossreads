as I have heard also bombs.
May 23Still camped on the outskirts of Sylvestre Cappel - have nothing to write about just waiting (that is what we all feel) for Fritz's next big effort. We are having moonlight nights & Fritz is doing a lot of night bombing round about here - varied with long distance shelling - he put half a dozen big shrapnel over the village last night.
From a small party, some 12 of them - German prisoners brought down a week ago I got a ration of their army bread. Black, sodden looking & most unpalatable stuff
