 Moved off at dawn in a Nth-Nth Westerly direction till 10.30 am. Halted for a rest for camels & a snack for ourselves. 
 3 miles now from line and our guns & boys are making it hot for "Jacko" on this new front. 
 Camels watered & fantasies filled. Turks held this position Esdud yesterday morning.  Left  
 We left at 3 p.m. and travelled till  dawn  dusk almost in sight of the village of Yebna.
