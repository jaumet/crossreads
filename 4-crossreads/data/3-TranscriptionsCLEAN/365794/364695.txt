  
 Friday 19 October 1917 And for the last time we go down the hold & do a final packing at our boxes. Very hot & thousands of tiny waves sparkle in the sun like so many gum leaving [leaves ?] dancing in the wind when the sun shines after a shower in our own dear Australia.  Ships appear on the horizon now &  tiny  fishing boats - dhows - stand like tiny fairy things on the edge of the world (as we have seen it for 5 weeks now). S. Watson improves slightly.  T. down 99 degrees. Sleeping on deck tonight & oh, how stifling is the cabin.  Today a large yellow butterfly fluttered by the Ayrshire's side, and dolphins (?) great blue green fish spring in the air after our tiny flying fish.
