<p>to Australia again on transport.  She has been expecting to leave for over a week now but on Saturday she was still waiting for her boat.</p>
<p>Two of our Sisters were spending the day in Cairo and saw her.  Quite a number have gone &amp; are going now, so one never knows what will happen to yours truly.</p>
<p>I saw George Bower on Friday for a few minutes &amp; he looked so brown &amp; well.  He is a Corporal now and his Officer told me he was a good fellow &amp; is sure to get on well.</p>
<p>I must write a few lines to dear old Alice, she always writes me such nice letters and gets up early in the morning to do so.  I dont think there is any more news this week.  Hope to receive an Australian mail to-morrow.  It is after 3 a.m. &amp; I'm feeling very sleepy so must walk about.  Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all &amp; hope you are all well.</p>
<p>From<br/>your loving sister,<br/>Edith.</p>
