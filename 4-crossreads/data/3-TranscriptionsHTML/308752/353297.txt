Measles broken out on board, the number of cases are increasing daily. A serious accident occurred, a soldier who fell down the hatchway was brought in our ward, he has been moaning all day.

A boxing championship was held this afternoon but the exhibition was very poor, the towel being thrown in by the loser in the fourth round.
