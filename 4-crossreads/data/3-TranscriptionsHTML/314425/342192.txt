<p>line is a long way advanced.</p>
<p>Thursday September 5. 1918. 1493.<br/>Fine but cool &amp; cloudy. Yesterday we shifted our horse lines across the road to a German stable that was lately occupied by some of our artillery transports. It is on the edge of marsh that forms part of the river here.<br/>14,600 prisoners have been taken since the first of the month.<br/>The limbers were loaded &amp; shifted to the stables today &amp; in the evening orders came through to move forwards. We got away after tea. The roads were very dusty, in fact suffocating for there was a lot of traffic. Presently a storm blew up. Thunder &amp; lightning &amp; heavy rain which lasted half an hour. Many were wet through I had an oil skin in the limber. On the way the Perch pole of one of the cookers broken when crossing the railway near Hem &amp; had to be left behind. We reached our destination after 8 p.m. &amp; camped in an open field, pitching a cover against a bank alongside some Scotch &amp; Welsh burial parties. Fortunately the rain cleared &amp; the night was fine.</p>
<p>Friday Sept 6. 1918. 1494.<br/>A fine morning. Yesterday when we ascended the hill coming from Curlu we could see the smoke of about a dozen big fires on the skyline. The heavy rain failed to put some of them out.</p>
