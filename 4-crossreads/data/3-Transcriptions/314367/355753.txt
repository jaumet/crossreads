<p>I'm just putting on record a fact &ndash; The Ward room has 7 Officers &ndash; Add to that Fritz = 8 &ndash; In <u>6</u> days the Beer (Resch's lager) drunk &amp; to be paid for is <u>157</u> Bottles i.e. &ndash; 3 Cases &amp; 13 Bottles &ndash; Of course there were guests &ndash; thirsty ones &ndash; Also of course Beer was not the only drink &ndash; Gin &amp; Bitters &ndash; G &amp; Vermouth &ndash; Lemon Squash &amp; whisky &ndash; Brandy (rarely touched) &ndash; Soda water made by ourselves &ndash; Truly its marvelous &ndash; my own notion is &ndash; that &ndash; though the Officers pay &ndash; yet others drink as well &ndash; who don't pay &ndash; Nevermind &ndash; Cheer-O &ndash; The Country is in a state of war &ndash; A favourite drink is the one that Captain Cook had &ndash; when he first landed &ndash; "a little gin" &ndash; Vermouth &amp; Gin are known as 'Virgins' - &amp; asked for as such &ndash;</p>
