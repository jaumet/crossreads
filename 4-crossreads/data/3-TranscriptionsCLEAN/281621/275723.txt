  
 Sunday 4 A concert troupe at Deckebusch. Move up to Zonnebeke tomorrow again. Meet Bill Sutton 
 Monday 5 Move up to Zonnebeke again. Going in the shelling in parts was severe, but at the R.A.P. things are very quiet. One carry to Pill Box at Railway Dugout was very hot in parts. A Canadian attack on Paschendale within 48 hrs Italian news still very bad. 200,000 men 1800 guns 
 Tuesday 6 From all accounts this mornings stunt was entirely successful the village of Paschendale being in Canadian hands. It is to be hoped that they can hang to it. Very few Australian casualties. Often bad luck still follows us & this morning we had three killed & one badly wounded. "Snowy" Walters was among the killed, a fine little chap. (cp. Sat. 3rd) 
 Wednesday 7 Nothing special. At Potsdam Train on the Roulus railway. The shelling still continues heavy 
 Thursday 8 Move back to Dickebusch via Ypres & re-join the unit. We move from this area shortly for a good spell. News of the loss of an outgoing mail. 
 Friday 9 At Dickebusch. Weather wet & miserable. Move on Sunday morning probably to Renescure near St Omer The funeral of "Snowy" Waters etc who were killed in last stunt 
 Saturday 10 Wet weather & still at Wickebusch. Transport moved to-day & we move tomorrow in char-a- bancs
