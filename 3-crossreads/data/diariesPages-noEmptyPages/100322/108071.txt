Romescamp. Havre
The remainder of our journey was made uneventfully through very pretty country. Pulled into Triage siding at about 5 p.m. ? there were some hundreds of very well dressed and smart Hun prisoners here including some of their jacktars. Marched through the streets of Harfleur which has an old church to a Cleansing Camp. Here formed up and told the men off to their companies lines. Then went to the mess and had some dinner. The surroundings of the camp are very beautiful at this season owing to the wonderful shades of green the woods and fields take on. In Australia there is certainly nothing to rival the verdancy of these old world countries. The troops were soon all well and comfortably settled down. One sees W.A.A.Cs V.A.Ds Red Cross girls walking round. Good to sleep after hard bench in truck last night.
