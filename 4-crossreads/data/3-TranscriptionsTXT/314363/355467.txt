Owing to the dark, things got mixed up, the farm intended to be raided, was not, one prisoner was taken & a small machine gun, our side has one missing - two slightly wounded.Last night was a queer one. At night we put up a two minute bombardment, it was sharp & furious, then later a raiding party or something went over & there was another heavy bombardment, this time it lasted for about an hour. Fritz did not reply very much but after everything had settled down again, he suddenly opened up a furious bombardment against the 3rd Div. lasting about a 1/4 hour, to which we hardly replied.Wytchaete 15.3.18A couple of nights ago there was a raid on our right at the same time we had a dummy one.
