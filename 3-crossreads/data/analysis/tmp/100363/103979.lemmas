 of Light Horsemen in my pictur for histor record ; and though they did not actual take part in the captur , it was undoubt due to their speedi advanc in the direct of Jaffa and their threat to outflank the enemi , which great facilit the fall of Jerusalem into our hand : furthermor , pictur of Jerusalem are of no militari or public Interest unless some of our troop are includ . 19 Jani Spent day at Desert Corp ( Dieran ) develop and bring my work up to date . 20th Jani . Sunday To Richon a delight Jewish villag six mile from here . I met the staff of the Anzac Mount Divis and took a seri of photog of their attach mountain batteri and signal . 21st Jani Left Dieran at 7 am with Capt Rhode in a Ford for Jerusalem , my two men follow in a Box Car with equipag . With a beauti morn favour , we had a fine though bumpi run to Latron which is at the foot of the hill . The plain abrupt termin , and we began the ascent of the foothil along a passabl good road which bend and wind amongst the steep inclin of Judaea . The sceneri is veri fine . As one pass along , ever upward , through the narrow gorg of limeston there are transcend glimps into deep valley , blue grey with weather limeston , and cultiv here and there , wherev there is suffici soil , with gnarl old oliv tree . And close inspect show the mountain slope to be ablossom with , Narcissus , Anemon , and the beauti littl cyclamen . I got out of the car to pick some , and as my footstep crush down the stunt verdur , it gave out the sweetest perfum which I recognis as that of the aromat herb , of thyme and sage . Rhode I found a fine companion and we enjoy ourselv discuss the sceneri and liken it to certain part of home . Half way up the pass we met Lieut Hardi ( in charg of the 20 men I had ask for ) with his troop and limber . I took a seri of pictur , and was fortun in be abl to includ a parti of Turk prison on their way to the intern camp . As we near the first summit , a short halt was made to enjoy the magnific panorama which open up . Look back westward over the great round wave of limeston - which characteris these hill - one could see over 25 mile of plain , to Jaffa in the distanc , and the sea beyond ! And yet so clear was the atmospher , that one might discern detail and be delud into number the distanc at 10 mile . On the Eastern slope immedi below us , began a seri of sharp hairpin bend descent , which led into the valley . Immediat in front perch on a hill crest lay Kulonish near where the Turk destroy the fine bridg over the Wadi Surar when they retir on Jerusalem . Again up a gradual inclin which follow the trend of the main ridg , we pass the villag of Lifta , with it squar stone build that look like a seri of blockhous . Onli a mile away on the hill top lay Jerusalem . Everi inch of the ground was interest with some biblic associ and I sincer regret my lack of testament Enlighten . Still I doubt if I would have appreci it the more . The entri into Jerusalem is as disappoint as enter a Mansion by the sculleri door . The way is through modern build , and a dens peopl thoroughfar , dusti and commonplac , that quit disappoint me . It is necessari to secur pass to enter the old Citi , which we experienc no troubl in do and forthwith we decid to lunch and inspect . Foodstuff are scarc in Jerusalem and the hotel be fill , Rhode and I were compel to eat at a near-bi Cafe of unprepossess appear . Neither did the meal bell the extern aspect of this apart . The meal consist of meat and carrot - no doubt deceas camel ( probabl diseas ) was respons for the tough of the former , but we were hungri and did neither care nor inquir . The sweet cours was simpli fig . Fig boil until the syrup was semi liquid , which cours need a good wash down with Jerusalem wine to scour away the tast . Into the cleanli of the establish we did not peer too close , but the appear of the proprietor who came out to collect the Tariff near made us violent ill .
