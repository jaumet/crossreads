19-5-16work than the troopers here & the only casualties on our side has been sigs sending messages & got potted & only two or three of them;  The days feel much cooler here than at Hill 70 as a cool breeze blows continually from the sea, but the 6th say it was 123 in the shade last Tuesday
The rumors we heard at Hill 70 of the mutilation of the bodies of dead & wounded Tommies by the Arab women is denied by the troops here they say that all the wounded Tommies were well treated by the Turks who could not take them away, but left them enough food to last them a couple of days & filled their water bottles for them & the native women came along later with more water & treated them very well;By all reports all the "Bints" that have been captured have been treated very well & shown every respect by the troops & are generally kept here at Head Quarters
