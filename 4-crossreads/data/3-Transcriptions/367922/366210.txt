<p>My dear Fry,<br/>I want you to know of our sorrow and sympathy, but I can't put them into words. At a time like this one feels what a helpless thing friendship is, and yet when I was passing through the dark waters nothing helped me so much as the clasp of an old friend's hand. God help the poor Mother.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>David Ferguson</p>
