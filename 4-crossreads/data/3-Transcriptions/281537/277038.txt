<p>20/9/15  Gallipoli<br/>Stand to arms 4.15 and as cold as can be.  Pitch dark and star lit when I rose and as I put my head out of the blanket door a bullet went "phut" into the earth only a few inches off.  From where I don't know but it was a narrow shave.  A monitor putting shells into some position up Suvla way.  The sound "bang, pause, plonk". This morning washed shaved and cleaned teeth in a cup or two of water.  This is as per usual.  A peculiar bomb affair in Lone Pine.  A new man in the trenches lit a bomb but seemed to have no power to throw it gazing at it in a mesmerised sort of way.  It burst and killed him and two others wounding several more.  In the firing line this morning yarning to the "heads".  All merry and profanely bright</p>
