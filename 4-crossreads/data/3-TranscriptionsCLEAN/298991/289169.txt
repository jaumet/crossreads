  
 Friday May 18th Arrived in Edinburgh at 4.45 am. Had some breakfast at the red cross room on the station. Went for a walk round the city. It is a very well laid out place with very wide streets, but the trams are the doers. They are cable trams & very small. Raining this morning. Went out in a motor bus to the Fort Bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth. It is a marvellous piece of engineering work, & is a mile & three quarters long, two spans is 1,710 feet high, & the highest part is 361 ft above high water. It cost over 3,000,000 & took 5,000 men 7 years to construct. 
 After we had dinner we (a N.Zr. & myself) went up to the old Edinburgh castle, parts of which date back to 1349, & is a very historic place, commanding a great view all over the city. We later went through the Edinburgh Academy, where there are some splendid paintings, some worth hundreds of pounds. I put up at the Victoria League club for the night, it is a very comfortable place established only for overseas troops. My feet were aching very much when I arrived at the club. I like the ways of & the scotch people very much. Things are much cheaper here than in London. Went for a walk through the gardens. 
 Saturday May 19th Did not get out until about 9.30 am. Caught the 1 pm train for Glasgow, arriving there about 2.15 pm. There was a "Scotch mist" at Edinburgh when we left, but it is bright enough upon arrival at Glasgow. Booked bed at Y.M.C.A., they only charge sixpence there & not bad beds either. over
