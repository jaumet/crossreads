31/1/18 London ? Boulogne
We were part of a convoy accompanied by torpedo boat destroyers. Although the sun was bright and the water calm the temperature became very cold made the trip disagreeable. Pulled in at Boulogne at 1 pm and made for the EFC Officer's Club which is splendidly comfortable. It is staffed by W.A.A.Cs and I noticed them also at the Signal Office. Very neat and smart in their brown uniforms but what an atmosphere for a young girl. At lunch we had ample white bread and a flowing sugar bowl which was much appreciated. Walked down the promenade by the beach. The town is built on rather a steep upward slope and some of the streets are stepped like stairs. Along the quays were plenty of fishing craft and fishermen in loose red blouses. Rather dark looking class of people talking volubly in French.
