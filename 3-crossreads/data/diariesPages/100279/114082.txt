let fly with rifles machine guns wiped nearly the whole crowd out they counted over 40 dead left on the ground. I reckon that was a brave deed.
We never went into the line this time for some reason or other but stopped at Eaucourt Abbaye done fatigues.
They are piling the guns on to this part of the line properly I know of one little sunken road between a great German dump the Abbaye where there is a gun for every 10 yards it must be a good  of a mile in length.
On the 6th we had a fairly heavy fall of snow but it did not lay on the ground long, but a cold bitter wind followed for nearly 24 hours after it.
