  
 We landed at Plymouth at about 8.40 P.M. British time & entrained for Parkhouse Camp Salisbury  We arrived at the camp about 4.50 A.M. after wandering & loosing ourselves several times.  We left the station at about 3.10 A.M.  This is the best camp I have ever seen.  We got a very cordial reception when we landed the crowd consisting mostly of women & children unfortunately a number were in Black.  The 2 weeks we were on the boat were most unlucky ones for the Allies on the Sea.  I seen something that surprised one to night that was the Sun setting at 9.20 P.M.  This is partly due to the daylight saving Bill but that does'nt wholly account for it.  The sun sets much later here than I would have believed possible if I didn't see it myself.  at Midsummer they must'nt have any darkness at all, because even after sunset there is still a long twilight. 
 14-6-16 Much struck by the beauty of the landscapes around here and all the way up in the train the country was just as lovely.  The beauty of the hedges is very striking after
