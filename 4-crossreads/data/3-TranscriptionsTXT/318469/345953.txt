is a fairly large village but it has been much knocked about & a good deal burned by shell fire from the Fleet.  There is a fairly large Mosque with a tall Tower & this appears to be intact.  On our way back we had a storm at the "Beach" & while there a shrapnel shell burst quite close to us & killed one & wounded another man.
14thThings have been mostly quiet today.  A few high explosive shells came across from the enemy in the afternoon but did not do much harm.  Late in the afternoon we could hear a tremendous bombardment going on at Achi Baba.  Things going well.
15thThings as usual today.  A fair amount of Artly fire & feeble response from Enemy.
16thFeeling very ill - off duty.  Things appear to be going along as usual.
17thStill off duty.  Feel little better today.  A good deal of Artillery fire today - mostly from our guns.  Royal George Edward sunk by Submarine off "Tantalous Island", on 13-8-15 with troops aboard ("British") - about 2,000, crew exclusive.  Only about 600 were saved off a Hospital ship on its way to Alexandria.  The "Royal Edward" was also carrying guns & Ammunition for the Peninsular.
18thFeeling better today - resumed light duties listening in tunnels.  Late in afternoon the Enemy opened heavy fire with two light guns about 500 yds from our trench in front of "German Officers Trench" also with a .75 MM but did no great damage.  Our Artillery fairly lively.  Other things as usual.
