May 20 Jolly good open air Concert in the grounds. Rather a decent Hosp this, & the grounds are A1, & of course the Nurses. You bet.
21 And at 2 am today the clocks were put forward one hour & this morning we got up an hour earlier. Lord is it any wonder that I felt sleepy. Gee! Last night at 8 oclock was real daylight (or twilight) & 8 is our bedtime, so whats it going to be tonight. The sun will be shining im thinking.Feeling A1 after a shave & a brush up. Went to Church (Non Con) & meanwhile the Sister was looking all over the place for me. Big crowd of visitors in today. Rather warm in the Sun. Struck a couple of our chaps & we were yarning together when a lady took our photo & promised to send the result along later. Not a bad Hosp, no men orderlies & good nurses. In fact its better than being in France.[in margin] Sunday
