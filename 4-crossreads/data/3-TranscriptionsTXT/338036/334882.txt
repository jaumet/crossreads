[23rd May contd]which Fritz was shelling.  On arrival at Charing Cross we got our belongings together & set out through the Subsidiary lines for Wantage Hall & arrived safely to find there an excellent dugout & plenty of room.  We found some difficulty in getting thro the trench in parts owing to trees being blown across it during the stunt last Friday and outside of our dugout was quite a dozen specimens of any shells & pieces.  A hole a yard away made apparently by 5.9 had cut the dugout sand bags about a good deal and a hole was thro the door apparently the splinter that Knuckles West had stopped.
