<p>Dull but fine &ndash; Heavy bombardment still continues, looking forward to something big if it keeps fine &ndash; very few casualtys in today, but the Australians are coming in by dozens &ndash; sick trench feet &ndash; effects of cold etc. Fritz shelled the Advanced Dressing Station at Thistle Dump &ndash; injured seriously 4 Bearers &amp; killed two &ndash; 6th &amp; 7th Stretcher Bearers have had a lot of casualtys in the field since we came out &ndash; Got hold of a paper today &amp; it referred to the coolness of a Battalion that Fritz caught while changing over in broad daylight &ndash; it said in spite of heavy casualtys, they just continued as if nothing had interrupted &ndash; this happened to be the 54th Batt &ndash; coming out &amp; the 56th going in, well do I remember it &ndash; I was right in it &amp; make special mention of being extra busy on Nov 1st. Saw 2 Taubs brought down in good style this evening. Fritz shelled our quarters here for about half an hour during the night &ndash; nobody injured, a few waggons etc destroyed, nearest shell to where I was in</p>
