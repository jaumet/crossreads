 Friday 5th July Great celebrations in England & Paris to kid the Yanks somewhat.  The King, Queen etc went to see a baseball match.  The Huns heavily counterattacked last night commencing early in the evening.  The bombardment was one of the heaviest I have witnessed & continued for several hours.  He was repulsed everywhere but our proportion of dead was heavy to total casualties  Great aerial activity & 3 of Fritz's balloons were brought down in flames together.  Lord Rhonda the food controller, a great Englishman, dead, one of the most successful of the war leaders. 
 Saturday 6th July Applied for leave to NICE but do not expect it for some time.  The front quiet again.  Prisoners in last stunt totalled 1500 & we captured Hamel Village & a couple of woods. Did my washing & started on the weekly requisition.
