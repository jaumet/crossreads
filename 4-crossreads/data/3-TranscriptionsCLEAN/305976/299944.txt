  
 Tuesday Nov 27 All troops when on leave in Towns to be armed. Numerous spies still about. Several have been caught signalling & directing enemy Artillery from roofs of houses. Air raid through night. Wednesday Nov 28 Jacko bombed Jaffa today No Anti Air Craft guns here yet. Jacko knew this & flew low. He bombed the town systematically killing Jews & Bedouins & by some strange coincidence did not get one soldier although the Town was full. Jaffa is situated on the coast of the Mediterranean & built right down to the Waters edge. It has a fine beach for surfing
