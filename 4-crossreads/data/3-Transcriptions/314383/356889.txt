<p>convoy of Rifles &amp; ammun passed thro the place two days ago bound for Kutchik Khan.  Rotten luck we didn't meet them.</p>
<p>June 18<br/>Arrived at Bijah much to the consternation of the Governor on a/c of us coming in from the north due to us striking the main road north of Bijah.  Camped on the outskirts near a poplar &amp; and vine plantation.  Plenty of food fresh water.  Extremely tired dusty &amp; footsore.</p>
<p>This last stage was a nightmare.  Food was terribly scarce &amp; the water nearly drove us mad.  Thanks only to Capt Hooper we were able to get anything as he rode off from the beaten track to mountain villages &amp; and got a little food, otherwise we would have had a very thin time.</p>
