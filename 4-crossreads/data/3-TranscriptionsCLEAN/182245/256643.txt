1917 MAY
8 TUESDAY
Raining all morning but cleared
up in afternoon. Cleaning harness
all morning & I went to
Stenwerck for a bath in afternoon
Got another letter from Linda.
There was a battery turn out
at night but I did not have to go.
We heard that Russia had
declared a separate peace
with Germany, which is the
worst piece of news since
the war began. I hope its not
true, & can hardly believe
Russia would be such a cow.
Lord it will mean another
five years war, & the best
part of a man's life in this
Godforsaken place. Anyway
we have got to win & by
Jove we will.
