<p>Monday 22 July 1917 [1918]<br/>Hilda's birthday!  What a sad day for us all &amp; I doubt not for her too.  Poor little girl I would rather she were lying peacefully with Kath by the ocean at Little Bay than living as things are.<br/>Interesting talk with Lt. Taylor, R.F.C. "flying man".  Describes the fall.  Going out 4.30 a.m. or thereabouts &amp; up about 160 ft. got into thick fog, tried to stall the machine, fly straight up &amp; get through it, instead machine must have turned sideways &amp; begun to nose dive, not able to see an inch ahead &amp; not knowing they were descending, first thing that happened the wings would strike the earth breaking the fall (for the one boy at least) perhaps the other was killed outright &ndash; this one Lt. Taylor W.C. broken arm etc.  The O.C. insists on so many hrs. flying per day &amp; too hot midday &amp; now with the Nile rising, usually a fog 6 a.m.</p>
