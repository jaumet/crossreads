 paring to fire the next salvo, tells me that there is no hurry.&nbsp; And

 and just before the shot should reach its mark some wonderful 
 machine sounds a hooter in the foretop at which everybody directs 
 his glasses at the target just in time to see eight geysers rise up 
 on the horizon nicely round that speck of a target.&nbsp; By this time all

 a minute and the target is frequently obscured by the columns of water 
 rising when the shot strikes.&nbsp; The ships turn about and round go the 
 guns still pouring in their broadsides.&nbsp; Which splashes belonged to 
 which ship I couldn&#39;t tell but there is an observer on that trawler

 repelling night attacks of submarines and other torpedo craft. 
 Again targets were provided, and the ship had to find them with her

 for it.&nbsp; Nevertheless I had ample opportunity to see the destroyers 
 at their work both in conjunction with the battle squadrons and at 
 their own evolutions and I must say that to a layman like myself 
 the work of the destroyers possesses more thrills than that of the
