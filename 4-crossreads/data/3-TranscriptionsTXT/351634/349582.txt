 [Page 2] (Tuesday continued) 13th company for duty that is men for guards and fatigues. I forgot to mention who were our officers. Our OC is Leut Vine Hall and Second in command is Leut Harland the 13th there are on board reinforcements for 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 9th and 15th battalions. Moonlight tonight no wind. (Wednesday 17th) Lovely morning passed through some islands. A couple of steamers passed going south - sea smooth. Boys have boxing matches to night Time to go to bed very warm (Thursday 18th) This time we did stick fast on the coral. Seang Bee ashore at 4.20 (am) and all efforts to get her off were a failure. Called up Choon by wireless she arrived at 10 am and line on board but Bee would not move Tow line parted and today gave up hope of refloating today waiting till next tide. Low water, one would think that we were in the middle of a green field some lovely coral growing here. Boys got the boat out and went over to a lagoon for a swim Lots of sharks swimming around ship officers shooting at them with revolvers. They are going to have another try to night at 10 Oclock. Fine night moonlight failed to get her off tonight so will turn in. (Friday 19th) Still on the reef Volunteers from each company to discharge coal in fore hatch. Started sending up coal at 9 AM and dumping it overboard Choon had another try to tow us off but did not succeed. Motorboats arrived from Thursday Island at dusk boys still at coal expect to get off tomorrow am getting sick of this kind of life (Saturday 20th) Beautiful morning Choon passed a line aboard and started to tow us off but the line parted. After the tide got up a bit more we got off under our own steam There was a lot of cheering and hints slung around. We proceeded to Thursday Island Passed through the Jardine Passage. Very nice scenery Arrived at Thursday Island at 5 pm It looks a very pretty little place from the water Choon came in after us and went along side of wharf. We are going alongside to morrow everyone growling about Choon getting in first fine night.
