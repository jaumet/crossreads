2.  fingers.  Yes, small plants have to be planted periodically & they are too much Trouble.  Put in plants that will grow all the Time.  It was a lovely year for Climbing Roses here.  It was just glorious to see the archways in the Salisbury Gardens festooned by Pink, scarlet & white Climbers.  Glad to know that George wrote to Marie.  She writes lovely letters.  Auntie writes long letters to You Dad.  It is strange that so many go astray.  My word, You'd like to see her.  No Hanky-panky, a lovely woman, good & true & kind.  I could live with Auntie Annie for ever & never quarrel.  I have not seen one Primrose.  I do not know whether Wilts is defunct as regards primroses but I have not seen one.  Of course Buttercups & Daisies have been out for months & are still blooming.  The Hawthorns are red now & in a month's time we'll be nibbling at them.  We received the wattle.  It is just the same old Staff.  Our warm weather has gone now.  I had to put another blanket on last night.  I only have the 2 over me but during the coldest months I only have 3 but I have a flannell shirt on then as well.  I received a lot of papers lately so they are turning up all O.K.  Well Dad, I have  not very much more to tell you & I must write to Mum & I have many other letters to write I received 12 altogether this mail & there were 8 waiting for me on my return from Holidays.  It is some task to answer them all & do all the other odd Jobs that a permanent Bachelor has to do.  Glad to know that Snowy & Sandy are O.K.  Give my Regards to Otto & to all the Neighbours.  I would not marry my Nurse unless she were something of a marvel.  Nurses don't make good Companions or Wives.Love from Harry.
