Dear Mum, Dad & George,Here 'T'is Sunday Night again. I am just about to turn in as Ellis & I are off to the Island in the morning & we have to be up in time. It has been lovely weather all the week I only hope that it holds. I've been watching a good Cricket Match all the afternoon - our Boys won by 79 runs. I am all packed up now Sewing. I had to alter my Breeches to fit. They are always too tight. I am only writing a P.C. to-night as I've had so much sewing as a bride to be this week & not been out of the place. Ellis has gone for a bath then we will both turn in early. It is a very still night & I can hear music all over the Camp & it is making me feel dopey. We were delighted to hear of Dave's return. a big mail has gone down so lots of letters did not come our way but only the 26 May is missing of your. This Market Place is the main road. Imagine about 100 Farm Carts, Steam Tractors, Lorries etc.  Pigs, Poultry, Cattle Horses, Sheep & numerous chap-jock stalls. You'll  [indecipherable] of the Weekly Market Day. [indecipherable] Love to you all  Harry
