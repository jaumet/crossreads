<p>AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE.</p>
<p>The most extraordinary case was that of seven men who had been blown into the sea by one of the &quot;Sydney&quot;s early broadsides. Many men were found in the sea but these seven are said to have been thrown overboard alive. It must have been shortly after ten when they fell overboard. It must have been shortly after ten when they fell overboard. At about half past three when the &quot;Sydney&quot; was returning to the &quot;Emden&quot; after chasing the collier she passed some men who were swimming in the sea. She was towing some of the collier&#39;s boats at the time so she cut these adrift and the men climbed into them and were picked up later as soon as the &quot;Sydney&quot; could return. Later at six thirty when the &quot;Sydney&quot; was returning from North Keeling Island to see what had happened at the Wireless Station in the Main Group 15 miles to the South she passed another man swimming in the sea. He proved to be another German sailor who had been blown overboard. He must have been in the water for at least eight hours swimming in a region infested with sharks. I am told that he was swimming and not clinging to wreckage but of course it is just possible he may have left some wreckage to swim towards the &quot;Sydney&quot;. There is no doubt whatever about the main facts of this case.</p>
<p>THE SCHOONER.</p>
<p>The rescue of this man was one of the reasons which prevented the &quot;Sydney&quot; from reaching Direction Island before dark and indirectly combined to lead to the escape ofthe German landing party which had been destroying the wireless plant and cables. The landing party, from the moment when it realised that the &quot;Emden&quot; was being beaten, scoured the Island for all the stores and eatables to be found in it and put them on board a small Island schooner which was found in the harbour. This was a vessel of 70 tons named the &quot;Ayesha&quot;. She had no auxiliary engine but by the evening she must contained stores for three or four months. It was after dark before she sailed and as the tropical night falls very suddenly it was impossible to say what course she was taking. It is possible that she may make for one of the Dutch Islands and it is thought she will getb there although it is a great distance to the nearest land in any direction.</p>
