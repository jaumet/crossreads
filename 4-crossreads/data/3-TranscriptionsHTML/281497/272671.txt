<p>Tonight I am Corporal of the picquet, we have to patrol the streets with a body of men, &amp; see that order is kept.</p>
<p>The Australians have adopted a movement of their own in the new bayonet fighting, &amp; it has been so successful, that it is being taught by all the Instructors in France be they British or Canadian it is called the "Australian Punch" &amp; is the finishing movement after you have engaged &amp; missed your man in the thrust, it is done with the butt &amp; is very effective the boys are fine with the bayonet I reckon we do that part of our drill best of all</p>
