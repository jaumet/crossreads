Thursday 28th. Great day, feeling much better, managed to get up for a couple of hours. Find bed the best place. I wrote Lt. Hornstein about my personal gear, was unable to gather it the morning I was gassed , also asked him to forward papers in connection with my transfer.Hope he will send them along to our Australian Hospital Harefeld.Representative of Aust. Red Cross Society called here today, supplied us with minor requirements and colonial papers. Comforts were also distributed at 55 General, 2nd C.C.S. and at Dover Cambridge Branch of St John's Ambulance cared for us at local station. Here we received a good cup of tea and biscuits. Its difficult to obtain good tea and as I am still off the beer suffer considerably.Good Friday 29th. The day by no means cheerful, cloudy all morning and raining during afternoon One side of wards is made chiefly of glass and when the sun does shine it is pleasant to dwell therein.We are now in the season of sunshine, shower and cloud.The fruit trees are commencing
