Friday 20 July 1917.
Reveille 7 a.m. Another good sleep in. Still no duties for those inoculated.
At 1 pm left this area with others on leave to Ismailia 1 pm to 9.30 pm. It was Christmas Day in this country. Queer & quaint sights were to be seen. Had conversation with Indian troops, one a Sgt Redigul 58 Rifles V.C. hero. Took a snap of them in Rue Negrelli. Returned to camp at 8.30 pm.
Got 9 letters by mail that had been given out while on leave. Read them over hurriedly before "lights out". Cpl. Brennan 4th A.L.H. 7th Regt. had called to see me about George Kelley.
The European population came out of doors towards evening in Ismailia.
