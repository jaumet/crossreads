  
 Well, Mrs Dunlop, my good looks got me the job of representing our lot amongst 25 officers from the Division. 
 As the rendezvous had been bombarded by Taubes fairly often, we had a couple of our planes overhead all the time to see fair play.  Later on, the trophys of guns, mortars & machine guns captured in the last "stunt", were inspected as they stood in a village square, close by. 
 Dr Douglas left here to-day as he is returning to Australia. I had dinner with him a week ago & he told me Dr Horsfall was away with the Navy. It must be hard on him with his partner going away & leaving the practice to locums. At least I should image so. It is a wonder he did not wait until Dr Douglas returned. All ranks were sorry to lose the "wee" captain & his major told me that he was one of their best officers. I hear that Drs Eames & Dick are listening to 99, 100 in The Old Country still. 
 We have had quite an epidemic amongst our captive observation Balloons the past week. The Huns consider we are too inquisitive & over comes a couple of their "planes".
