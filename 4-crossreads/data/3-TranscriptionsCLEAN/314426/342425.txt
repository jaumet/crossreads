  
 Friday Jan 17. 1919. 68. A fine bright day. The Ulysses will sail to morrow, at any rate all troops for her will leave here early to morrow morning. To day will decide whether I & some others in this ward will go with her. It all depends on the Doctor, as we are under Isolation. This afternoon I walked to Wit which is situated on a high Hill on the road to Portland about 2 miles from MonteVideo. It is only a small village but has a 13 century church with a high square tower which can be seen from miles around. We were back in time for tea. Saturday January 18. 1919. (69) Last night there was great excitement & uncertainity in the Camp,  concerning those who were to leave by the boat today. A large number of men were struck off the supplementary roll, & most hospital patients left on, including those in this ward. It was not until last night that we knew definately  that we were not to go, on account of the isolation. One man last night was notified that he was to go to make one of the special duty staff. Later that he was not to go & about 10.30 that he was, and at 4. this morning he was woke up & informed that he was not to go. [Shorthand - I wrote to Cis yesterday]
