1917DecA chain of buckets lifts it to the second puddler where it is further broken down. A sluice is opened occasionally to allow it to run to No 3 to be further broken down (I have not put in the machinery for working these puddlers, but they were worked by electric motors, the whole plant being worked by electricity generated on the works). In this plant, things being so scattered, they had to use a force pump to convey the mixture about 100 yards to another puddler where the mixture was brought to the consistency of milk, its color being a dirty white. A small pump conveyed the mixture to a small drain which led into a small tank. The amount in the tank being regulated by an electrical contrivance. A thin even stream flowed from the tank to the top of the blast furnace where the heat dried the liquid into small pebbles. A word about the furnace:- A large cylinder, the size of which can be gauged from size of man in the plan was kept slowly revolving. It was lined with fire bricks and a small stream of coal ground to powder was blown into it by a special blower.
