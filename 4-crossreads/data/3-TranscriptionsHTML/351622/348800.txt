<p>23 March 1916 Thur 24 March 1916 Fri<br/>Woke at 5 am as the ship was moving along on its way to the dock. To-day is my birthday &amp; I am thoroughly enjoying it. Tom Windrum gave me a present.</p>
<p>Even now I cannot realize I am lying alongside the wharf at France one of the three places that has always been my ambition to see. Bell comes to the rescue with a big bottle of whisky.</p>
<p>Marched to our camping ground through the outskirts of the town. A more beautiful residence I never saw. It is 7 p.m. &amp; Scotty enters the tent accompanied by Steve &amp; Frazer &amp; a consignment of twelve bottles of the best.</p>
<p>25<br/>Picked to go with the advance party &amp; marched through Marsielles arriving at railway station 10.30 am. Left Marsielles 11.30 am being accommodated in exceptionally good traveling cars. Our first stop of importance was Arles from there to Avignon where we stopped a couple of hours. We received a great reception all along the line. Arrived Valence about 9 am coming in contact with many men.</p>
