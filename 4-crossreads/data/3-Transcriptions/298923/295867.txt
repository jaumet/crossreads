<p>20 July 1918 Saturday<br/>Here we are beyond Solomons Pools again for a 14 days spell only a long weary dusty night march-   I am acting Regt Commander for a little while as C.O. is at Brigade-   We will enjoy the spell of cool weather &amp; absence of Shells but Duties are heavy.  Men are still going sick from Shell Shock.   All the Huns belt buckles had "GOTT MITT UNS" on the clasp-   I wonder!!<br/>Good news from France tonight &amp; letters from England are more cheerful.</p>
