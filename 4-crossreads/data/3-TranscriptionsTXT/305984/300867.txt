were not what we were told so we were sent into lager for two days & then back to old camp 23036 what a fine reception we received from the Q. Master F.W. & beautiful it was.  made go to Schneverdingen for our kits.  we struck a snow storm coming back which made matters worse.  We to O. & I were made go into II B to sleep with Sgt   laugh the good time we were here [indecipherable]
22 / 26/18nothing of note here plenty of lies about the war
27/3/18Plenty of news about the German offensive it simply staggered me to think they could advance the distance they did in 8 days but they must have suffered for it in casualties of course we only hear of their side of the whole affair.  received money order dated 16/3/18 today
