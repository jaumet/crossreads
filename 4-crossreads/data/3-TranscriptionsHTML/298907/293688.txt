<p>can hand a lady about now as good as the majority, &amp; with as unconcerned an air as you like just as if I had been doing it all my life, thats one thing that knocking about the world has done for me, &amp; it is a splendid thing, opens the eyes of a lot of the English people, for it shows them that all Australians are not so uncouth &amp; ignorant as a lot of them appear to think, after this we went for a stroll round the "Bull ring" &amp; through the Market Hall where I snapped Mac &amp; the two girls on the steps, in a few sec's quite a crowd had collected as they always do when a camera  is flashed, after  this we walked home, &amp; just as we were near the hospital a girl Mac had been going with ran fair into him, I nearly died laughing</p>
