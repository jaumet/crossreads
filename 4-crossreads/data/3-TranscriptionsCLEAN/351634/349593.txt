Nothing to do now but go to bed and yarn Mac and I sleep in lifeboat. (Tuesday 13th) Mac Jack Beasley and I are to report to the cooks and take over the Galley for the afternoon Went and relieved cooks at 1 oclock and got the tea ready I can tell you we had a good feed out of it Our job is to be a short one however as we got orders to get ready for leaving the ship tomorrow. I don't know where we are going Hope next packet we get aboard is better than this one To bed once more. (Wednesday 14th) Got into lighter and was transhipped on board of S.S. Itria (A25) The 6th Battery field artillery is aboard here. They have the ship to themselves. Horses on lower deck and Guns down below in the hold. We have just got orders to take up our sleeping quarters in the horse stalls on deck That sounds cheerful the sadness is set in I think with us Its going to be a cold night so Mac and I rugged up a kind of sleeping room I don't think we will ever get proper sleeping apartments the living is a bit better here than on the Suffolk We are about to try our new sleeping apartment good night (Thursday 15th) Our bedroom was a bit more comfortable than sleeping in the open.
