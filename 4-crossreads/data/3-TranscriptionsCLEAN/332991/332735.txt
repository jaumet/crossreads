  
 Friday February 23. 1917 A cold foggy world, or rather morning.  The fog is very dense to day.  There was to be an inspection to day, so we had a general clean up of the whole camp and stables.  I posted a letter to my Father to day.  The newspapers came to hand this morning.  For some unaccountable reason there was no papers since last Saturday. There had been scarcely any artillery activity during the past few nights. 
 Saturday Feb. 24. 1917 A dull cloudy morning but scarcely any fog.  There are big guns booming in the distance and close at hand at regular intervals all the morning.  In the morning I was doing odd jobs and cleaning up.  I had an early dinner & went with Roy Partridge
