<p>Wed. 26/2/19</p>
<p>Fell in on Monday morning &amp; after a good deal of waiting the Dr. turned up, there were only 3 of us.  The Dr. got his stecoscope on me &amp; tapped my chest &amp; decided there was something wrong.  He was the same chap that marked me for the Board the day before.  Someone was hammering outside.  The Dr. cursed the noise a bit, &amp; I think that is where my weak chest came from.  Went back &amp; was told to stop on at the Y.M.  On Tuesday</p>
