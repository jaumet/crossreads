<p>Thursday 12 [11] July 1917 [1918]<br/>&frac12; day, stayed in until 4.30 p.m., then Cairo &ndash; bought white shoes, Pt. 53 &ndash; 2nd dinner.  Life has been so full these times &amp; the joy of nursing our own people is great.<br/>Jarroed, Dalby, looks tired of it all but the younger men can go on yet.  Groppi's known as the "Powder &amp; paint show" (to these officer boys) is a fine sight these 5 p.m. afternoons.  Officers of every description &amp; Sisters, V.A.D's &amp; civilians throng in &amp; out.  One takes one's plate &amp; fork, selects the cakes, pays Pt. 3 (or Pt. 1 each) &amp; walks through rows of tiny tables &amp; gazes to the fancied spot, garcon brings Icecream sodas, etc. &amp; one becomes one of the lookers on.</p>
