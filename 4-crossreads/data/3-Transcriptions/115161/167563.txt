<p>Daily, certain manouvres were gone through, such as running jumping, physical jerks, or something of the like nature, to keep us &quot;fit. Lectures on the contents and general &quot;ingredients&quot; and various shapes and formations of the latest man-destroying machinery were given by those who had taken a delight in studying such matters.</p>
<p>Our spare time was fully taken up by sports, telling yarns, playing two-up, drafts, and other forms of amusement, which can be enjoyed without the participation therein, of the fair sex.</p>
<p>About the fourth day out of Fremantle, some excitement was caused by the actions of a&nbsp;vessel, which appeared to be following in our wake. It was just getting dusk when the said steamer attracted our attention, and although our boat signalled to this&nbsp;strange vessel, no notice was taken by her. When darkness came on, the order was given to extinguish&nbsp;all lights. This of course made us wonder what was going to happen. We didn&#39;t expect any&nbsp;warlike excitement so early in the voyage. We noticed that the boat in our rear bore no lights, and we felt that at any moment something unusual might happen. We learnt the following morning that our captain had altered his course immediately darkness had set in. Of course the strange vessel may have been just a poor old harmless thing, but be that so or not it succeeded in &quot;putting the wind up&quot; us.</p>
<p>During the voyage I was &quot;on guard&quot; on the officer&#39;s desk, and thereby had not a very bad time, the sympathies extended to the poor chap on guard in the cold, took a very practical and-to-me-pleasant form.</p>
<p>I was invited in to the officer&#39;s cabins and &quot;pressed&quot; to accept the stimulants offered. If-I say if! - I hesitated, the Doctor would at once order me to consume what quantity he deemed necessary, for the duties I had to carry out as guardian of the upper deck. I remember that on more than one occasion the relieving guard had to get the rifle from an officer&#39;s cabin.</p>
