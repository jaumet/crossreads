<p>3 Monday<br/>Fell in 9.45 am &amp; caught 10.40 train to London everybody seems excited of having the privelege of getting off for the 4 day leave.  Arrived at Waterloo station at about 1.10 pm.  After going to headquarters at Horseferry Rd, we went round to the Aust Comforts funds &amp; obtained information regarding quarters which we eventually got at Victoria League Club off Burke st.  We later went to Victoria, Whitehall Charing X, Trafalgar square. Buckingham palace &amp; Parliament house</p>
<p>4 Tuesday<br/>Got permits from Works office to take photos of places in London.  We later went to the Strand &amp; Piccadilly.  Traffic here is very brisk.  About 12 noon we caught the bus for Regents Park &amp; the London Zoo, which is an Ideal place &amp; well worth the day of Inspection.  We done a bit of wondering about during the evening.  My word a fellow would never run short of a girl here.  They seem very fond of the Australians.</p>
<p>5 Wednesday<br/>Today has been quite an eventful day.  We visited Hyde park &amp; Rotten Row during the morning, coming back to Trafalgar square by Motor.  I took snaps of the following place Whitehall, Queens statue, two in Hyde park, Parliament House, &amp; Buckingham Palace. We spent the afternoon going over London &amp; Suburbs in a motor which cost me 12/- being 1/3 of the afternoon. We all had quite an enjoyable time.  I now have quite a good idea of London &amp; surrounds.  We motored home about midnight pretty tired.</p>
