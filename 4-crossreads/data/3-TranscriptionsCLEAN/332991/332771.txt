Tuesday March 6. 1917A cold cloudy day, and windy.  I stayed in bed nearly all day as it was easier to keep warm there.  Several were discharged from this hospital to day and others admitted.We had sliced pineapples and sauce for desert at tea to night  There is plenty to eat but unfortunately most of it is bully beef made into stews, though to night the stew was made with fresh meat.  This Hospital is in charge of the 10th Field Ambulance and Dr Webster who came with us to England on the "Persic" is one of the medical officers here
