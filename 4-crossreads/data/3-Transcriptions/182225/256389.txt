<p>SEPT. &nbsp; WEDNESDAY 27 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Started to rain about mid-day &amp; went on till evening. We got to Bulford about 10 AM and King George inspected us (the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Division) &amp; then we marched passed him &amp; the 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery was very good the best in the division they say. Anyway the officers were pleased with us &amp; we were pleased with ourselves. King George has aged very much since I saw him four years ago in India. The rain spoilt the show from a spectacular point of view, but even so it must have been great. Got a letter from Linda in answer to my letters from England. Am so glad she seems to be getting strong again, &amp; seems very happy. It makes all the difference in the world to know she is all right &amp; happy.</p>
