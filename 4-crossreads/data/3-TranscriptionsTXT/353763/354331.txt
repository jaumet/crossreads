We expect to reach Sydney some time on Thursday  -  We had to stop for 1 3/4 hours on Saty  morng  while some tubes in the condenser were being fixed up but so far that has been our only moan  -  All is well on board though I've one man with chronic appendicitis & another with fits but I hope to get them thro safely & land them on the beach  -
Socially all goes well  -  Bridge evy  -  eveg  -  We are teaching Herbert  -  He's certainly the worst learner I've ever seen met  -  A University man with a double degree but all the same his brain is a very slow one  -  He fails to grasp in toto the theory & practice alike  -  The paymaster (Hogarth) is a very good player  -  Keen & capable both as regards work & play & decidedly an acquisition  -  We all look forward to Sydney & don't mean to go out in the
