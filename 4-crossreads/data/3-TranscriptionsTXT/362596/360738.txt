 posted up with the news. I have not got my leave for England yet but there are a good many going and they say they have a great time and they say the people treat them splendidly. I have not heard from Bill of late but the last letter I got from him he was doing well but he did not know when he would be returning to Australia as he had to undergo another operation for his fingers. Len Simpson is not in this Battalion now but he is in this Brigade, I have not seen him for such a long time. Well Alice I will have to draw this scrawl to a close as news are very scarce over here. So hoping this finds you all enjoying the best of health as the departure of this leaves me. I remain with best love Clarence
