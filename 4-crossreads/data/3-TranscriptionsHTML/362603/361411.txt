<p>Australian Branch Red Cross letterhead B.R.C.S.<br/>Bulford<br/>5.4.17<br/>Dear Mum,<br/>This is Thursday night &amp; I was going to the Theatre.  I have been trying to get out all the week but have not had the chance.  I should have been on my way to Grimsby to-night but My leave was turned down.  I may be able to go in a fortnight's time.  Mail closes to-morrow morning &amp; we have only just heard of it, so it will be only a very hasty letter this time.  We have had lots &amp; lots of snow, ice &amp; rain, but I don't mind it a Scrap.  I was on Police Duty for 3 &frac12; hours the other night &amp; it was very tiring.  I am not used to marching up &amp; down like a Picket on Sentry on the Beat.</p>
