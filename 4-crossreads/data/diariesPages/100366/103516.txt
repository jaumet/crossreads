 
began a fight for mastery . One could see the flame coming from their machine guns, against the dark background. After about half an hour good going one of our planes scored a direct hit and the last I saw was the German falling through the air in a slanting position towards their lines.

10 of our fellows retuned from Poizeres Contalmasison and Albert today where they have been attached for some time. They have all had lucky escapes. Losing only 3 horses on the trip. They brought back many souvenirs with them

The Germans are again putting shells into Albert and Bosancourt and just as I write our 15 inch Sleeping Lizzie is answering them. This gun is fired from a specially built Railway track, and to take the tremendous recoil, the Engine is set going in the opposite direction at full speed and only just succeeds in stopping it.

The 1st Division infantry marched in this morning together with all columns, after having had a fair spell.

General Birdwood has told us that there is going to be no spells for the Australians until the war is over so finis. One of our chaps was severely kicked by a horse this morning , and is very bad as a result of same. Blousins is in England.
