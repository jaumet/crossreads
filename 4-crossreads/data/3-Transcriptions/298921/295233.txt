<p>September, 1915<br/>Sunday 19<br/>This is a Teetotal shop &amp; today I sent a nigger to an Hotel (open on Sundays) for a bottle of Johnnie Walker, gave him a small bag to put it in so as O/C would not see it.-<br/>My consternation nigger returned still with the bag in <u>one hand</u>&amp; the bottle in the <u>other</u> - Officers take it in turns to provide stimulants &ndash; as you know I'm not keen on it; hence the yarn.<br/><strike>Some of these subalterns never had so much money before &amp; they make regular fools of themselves &amp; all not fit to lead horses to water others the best stuff in the world.</strike></p>
