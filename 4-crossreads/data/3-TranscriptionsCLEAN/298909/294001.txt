two Cruisers. On this boat, all life Boats are swung out - Two sailors independent of the Bridge are on the lookout & our own lads are also on the lookout, have a strong guard armed for any emergency's - Every man including Officers, is fined, who does not wear his life belt at all times, even have to sit down to dinner with them on, needless to add they are uncomfortable & hot.
No lights after sundown is hard on us. The course we are taking is [sketch of zigzag] like this. Alexandria is a very busy port, & has large accomodation for the largest ships. The town proper is also very nice, clean & some fine Buildings - of course there is also the usual native quarters, to mar the horizon - Farewell Egypt - Finish Piastre - Finish Saida - Finish Gypo Mail - Finish Tomatoe & Eggs a Cook. Capt Coppleson very kindly consented to give any volunteers a few hints on French Language, so we hope at least to be able to find our way about, of course nobody knows our destination yet.
