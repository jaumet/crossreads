<p>5 April 1916<br/>Friday<br/>Just the same old camp routine. Things seem very slow after being away on Furlough We are having beautiful weather.</p>
<p>1918 April 2<br/>Saturday<br/>Very heavy rain during the morning but fine in the afternoon. Went to a concert in the Y.M.C.A. in the evening given by a travelling party calling themselves the Tourists. It was a rather good concert.</p>
