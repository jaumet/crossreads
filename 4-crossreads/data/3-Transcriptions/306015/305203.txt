For, she told me, three of her sons had gone to the trenches, and brushing aside a tear from her eyes, she said that one had been Killed in September 1914, and she pointed, half in sorrow, half in pride, to the picture on the Kitchen wall of a fine, strapping young soldier, in the prime of existence;  that was what the war had cost her.   And every home in France is the same.</p>
