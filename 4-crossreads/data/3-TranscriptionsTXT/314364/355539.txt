Sunday, Jany.26.Fine day again. Quite a number of Patients were admitted to Hospital today & kept us busy for a time. After Dinner went for a stroll into Weymouth. Met Archie Reed at the Soldiers Club, also saw [indecipherable] of the 8th, who said he saw my name on the "Nevarsa" Boat Roll, but I've heard nothing aboaut it yet. It turned out very cold after Tea & I wasn't sorry to get back to Camp. Wrote letter No. 9 to B.E.Monday 27. Weather very cold again. The Boots I got from the store are almost as good as new & a good pair of Boots are very necessary during this weather.Tues.28. Had quite a busy day putting the stuff in 14 Hut ready for stocktaking. There are plenty of strikes on in various parts of England, & no doubt they are helping to keep the Boats back. All the [indecipherable] in our hut are in great humour now they know that they are on a Boat Roll.Wed.29. My busy day fixing up the Tobacco Roll.  Plug "Havelock" is on the list & the Diggers are rushing it as good Tobacco is hard to get nowadays.Thur 30. I really ought to write some letters but I'm hanged if I can get going. Went into Weymouth after Tea. Did some shopping for "the Adjutant" & Cpl  Kinley. Walked both ways. It was jolly cold, & I wasn't sorry to get back to Camp & turn in between my blankets.Fri.31. Went to Depot Q.M. & drew the Tobacco for the week & [indecipherable] it. This is about the hardest job I have to do during the week "Andy" was told off to go to Sutton [indecipherable] tomorrow, but he's not at all keen about it.Sat.Feb.1 Another month gone. "Andy" got taken off the roll for Sutton [indecipherable] & is quite delighted about it. All the crowd in my Hut (13) who are on the [indecipherable] roll got paid today & went into  Weymouth to celebrate it.
