  
 although  pupils  are forced to remain idle, men testing new machines do quite a lot of flying over and around the aerodrome. In the house where I am staying are three other pupils two of whom have been waiting to "take their tickets" for over a week, but whenever they are ready either the weather is not suitable or there is something wrong with the machine (or "bus" as it is called). They can do nothing but wait patiently. Probably that will fall to my lot later on. At least you will say that I have plenty of time for letter writing. Well I hope to be able to keep my correspondence up to date - it is a long way behind now - but I intend also to see what I can learn in the workshops during some of the spare time. During the next few weeks there will probably be very little news but I expect to have a few experiences to relate in my letters. For the present, with kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson & Dorothy Yours very sincerely  Solomon Whitfield
