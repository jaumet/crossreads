The Australia - Syd & Melbourne have gone but this morning we heard that the Australia & Sydney were on their way back  -  This is but common sense since not a single German war ship in the Pacific has been captured  -  The A  M & Syd left - presumably to convoy our troopers across the Indian Ocean  -  You see in a sea fight it's all a question of guns & gunfire & the Australia only in our Pacific fleet (bar Japanese) is the equal of the Scharnhorst  -  There are 5 or 6 German war boats about & no one knows where  -We've heard nothing about AE1 - AE2 is very carefully convoyed now I can tell you  -  A submarine is all iron & machinery  -  I talked to a stoker in my sick bay this morning & asked him what the men on AE2 thought  -  They thought he said she'd dived & hadn't come up  -  The pressure below 100 feet wd eventually burst crush them  -  Just an accident he said  -  We heard a buz   -  that the Russians had landed troops in France - that the English & French & Belgians had driven the Germans back out of France - that "Bill" had thrown in his hand & wanted peace - probably all buz  -  We hear nothing about Europe  -  No papers since Townsville & not a reliable item from any source  -
