2A tin of 50 excellent Cigarettes, Three very nice hankies some boxes of matches vey acceptable, a tin of Tho Colgate's dental creme (just  as I was on the point of finishing my tooth powder) & some nice soap also Cigarette papers. Please don't send any more Cigarette papers, as I am going to smoke my pipe more, also please don't  send any more chocolate as it will be too hot in a couple of months unless we go to France.Did I thank you for the lovely snaps of the children? I am very glad to have them & treasure them. They are awfully good I think. When
