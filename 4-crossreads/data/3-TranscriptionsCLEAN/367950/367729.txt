21st December 1916 EL ARISH! ThursdayEl Arish at Last belongs to us!We started out from our old camp Gerarat at 6 pm and started for the desert. The 3rd Brigade and Imperial Yeomanry went along the coast where their (the Turks) outposts have been observed at various times. The New Zealand Brigade went out to the Wade El Arish and around behind them to try and cut them off and the 1st Brigade took a position behind the two. We marched in "column of route" during the exceedingly long and painful night march. Not a wink of sleep and about 10 minutes spell each hour.  At daylight this morning found us sweeping towards the town like a huge net. But Jacko had flown! He must have smelt a rat. I am sitting on a sand dune about a mile away from El Arish writing this and there is a cold cutting wind playing around. Today is rather a memorable one in the history of Egypt it marks the 2nd anniversary of the Expulsion of the Turks and the end of the Turkish Rule which had prevailed for 400 years. Two years ago we paraded the streets of Cairo and annexed the country for Great Britain.
Later Report same date.Bivouacked in among the Sand Hills to the N. E. of El Arish all soft sand. Bad spot for wood took 20 minutes to collect enough sticks to boil the billy.
