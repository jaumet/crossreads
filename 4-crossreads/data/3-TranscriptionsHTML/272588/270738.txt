<p>Monday 15 July<br/>Move up to Borre A.D.S. again.  News to hand of a new German attack North &amp; South of Reims but I do not know the results. The 1st Aust. Division is being relieved a brigade at a time by 29th Division &amp; they go back to Arques (Arces).  The Tommies take over the right sector to-night.</p>
<p>Tuesday 16 July<br/>Last night or early this morning rather the heat of yesterday was followed by a terrific thunder storm.  Several of our bombing 'planes were caught in it. To-day has been oppresively hot. Nothing happened on the front.</p>
