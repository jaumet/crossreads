 Saturday 1 March 1919 Went to Eaton Place to see about work but couldn't get any. Have made an appointment with the Studebaker people for Monday. Took Marie &amp; Janet to see the King review The Young Guards &amp; then to the football match at Fulham. Fulham played Chelsea &amp; won easily 6 to 2. There was a tremendous crowd at both shows. 
 McGowan came out to dinner. His right wing is still sore &amp; won't be right for some time. Took Janet to see the Naughty Wife. Gladys Cooper is the lead. It was excellent. Gladys Cooper had a broken arm &amp; still played. Enjoyed it immensely. 
 Sunday 2 March 1919 Up at 1.30 for lunch. Bonny day too. Wrote a couple of letters &amp; then met Janet &amp; we wandered round St James, Hyde &amp; Regent Parks. Had tea at Marie's. She was out &amp; had dinner at Pagani's in Gt. Portland Street &amp; then back to Marie's. She was home then. Janet has a job as a V.A,D for Marie.
