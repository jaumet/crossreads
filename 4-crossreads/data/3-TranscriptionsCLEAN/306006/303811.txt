Had a parade this morning to clean saddlery; Gen Chauvel came past today but did not call; There appears to be nothing doing at Gaza at present, a big supply of gas helmets were sent up some time ago & we believe we are going to use gas shells I received a parcel from Jessie today Snakes are rather plentiful here, Lindsay Rich killed one last night in the moonlight & we saw several during the last day or two
