Salisbury PlainsMonday 10thdid not bargain for the march that ensued.  We passed thro a village which was very pretty and reminded me of France.When at last we arrived at Larkhill Camp we were perspiring and standing as did in the rain which followed we felt quite miserable.It was not until about an hour afterwards that we were housed in our hut and that we felt better and that this was helped on when about 9 a.m. we had breakfast of Bully beef and biscuits and a cup of tea.I suppose we should have slept but I was aching to have a look round and consequently although tired I in company with a couple of others had a walk and saw what a huge place this Camp is (Salisbury Plains).  We learnt afterwards the the Plains Camp is 60 miles long by 40 miles wide, has in it 60,000 huts and has accomodation for 31/2 million troops.  It is reserved exclusively for Colonial troops and there are at present Australians, N. Zealanders, Canadians & Sth. Africans here.  It is also comforting to know that newspapers are so easy to obtain.  This was a thing we missed at sea.Our Camp (Larkhill) has as far as I can see about 30 small Camps in
