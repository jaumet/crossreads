<p>On board transport "Lake Mitchigan"<br/>4.15am April 25th</p>
<p>We are all mustered in lower deck awaiting orders, none of us know what is going to happen, but we think that we may be going ashore at some place or other. Suddenly we hear firing from guns a long distance off, and almost immediately our ship vibrates as if something gigantic had taken hold of it &amp;amp; shook it, evidently a warship has fired from a position quite close to us. I manage to elude the sentry on the gangway &amp;amp; get up on deck. What a glorious sight meets my eye, never shall I forget it, in the distance, about seven miles, I should say, but I can't be sure as it was dark, I could see tiny flashes from the Turkish guns on shore, it must be their shells which are dropping in the water about 200 to 300 yards on either side of us.

Our ship is travelling at the rate of a few miles per hour. We can hear rifle and machine gun fire, but we have not the faintest idea as to what is taking place. Our Warships are firing more rapidly now. An order has just come along to the effect that we are to prepare to get into the boats. The sun is rising and we are now able to see some hilly country in the distance, it reminds me of the scenery in Loch Lomond, Scotland.</p>
<p>The boys have now started getting down the rope ladders into their alotted boats, each which hold 26 men. In a few minutes a naval pinnace suddenly appears and having fixed a line to the foremost</p>
