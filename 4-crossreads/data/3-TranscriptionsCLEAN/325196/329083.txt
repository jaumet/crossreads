Sigs & put the morning in signalling with Helios; Les received a pass to town from dinner time & I put the afternoon in at the A.V.C. as the last snapshots of me were a failure I sat again; After tea Arthur Bottom & I went to Cairo; Morgan left Hospital at 3 oclock today; & he met us at Heliopolis & went in with us; We intended going to the Kursaal but found it filled & the doors shut, so we had supper at the Egyptian Cafe & then tea at the cake shop & then came home; We had geat fun in the tram , the compartment we were in had several Greeks & French & Bottom was at his best & caused plenty of amusement.
