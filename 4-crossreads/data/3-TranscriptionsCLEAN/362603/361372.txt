He contracted malaria up in the Mesopotamia   &   had to be sent back to India to recuperate.  I was so pleased to hear that poor Tom Porman is safe in Germany.  He will be alright.  It is just marvellous what a Soldier can live on.  To day I went for a walk & had fresh bread & butter   &   boiled new laid eggs, at a private Home in Fhyledean.  I have only had butter once before at aunties place   &   fresh bread   &   new laid eggs I had there also but nowhere else.  I read where 7000000 Gippo eggs were imported into England.  Goodness help those who are compelled to eat them.  Now George as I gave Mum all the news I will have to ring off.  I am doing well, plenty to eat & can have a lie in bed all day if I wish.  Ellis generally brings me my Breakfast to bed so it's not too bad for O.A.S. is it.  Give my Regards to All the Boys & to Mr Love, Os Merrett, Jim Pym, Wal Fisher etc.  We Hope to be Home by X'mas to be with them all again. Now, Adieu, Mon Frere So with Best Love to Dad, Mother   &   Lily I remain Your Loving Brother Harry Regards also to Mrs Porman   &   the Miles Family.  H.
