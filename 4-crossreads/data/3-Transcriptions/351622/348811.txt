<p>14 April 1916 Fri<br/>A very quiet night last night. Met Ray Rex this morning drinking his health with a bottle of<br/>[shamp]. Raining constantly to-day &amp; slight flakes of snow falling. Had my photo taken with Lawrence &amp; Germaine. News of French victories at Verdun. 30,000 German casualities.</p>
<p>15 April 1916 Sat<br/>A big day in company with Ted Allen visited the different inns. Several taubes about to-day. Thousands more Australian troops arrive to-day. Big concert in the mess-room to-night. Tommy artists big success. Jules leaving his home saying good-bye to his mother leaving for Verdun. I wonder if she will ever see him</p>
