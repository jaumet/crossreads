<p>land which I believe is Crete, with mountains that appear to be snowcapped.</p>
<p>March 30th:<br/>Fine calm day.  Call at Malta 12 noon, but sail about 12.30.  Machine gunners practise and shot a shark.</p>
<p>April 2nd:<br/>Arrive in Marseilles about 1.30 in morning.  Disembark, 2.30 p.m.  Meet Jim Bryden who had been left behind on guard until the First Division goes through.  Entrain and leave Marseilles about 4 p.m. by train.  French ladies welcome us as we pass through on train.  We are issued with tea and rum at about 10.30 p.m.  I am on Train Guard, and so ends my first day in France.</p>
<p>April 3rd:<br/>Dismount guard 9 a.m.  Travel all day.  Such beautiful scenery.  Mourning is very noticeable.  The gentle sex are in many cases stricken with grief.  The War is now becoming more real to us as we see these people who are fighting and suffering, hoping and praying for the enemies' speedy defeat.  Towns we passed: Avignon, Fleurville, Tyers, St. Germain, Duc Delay, Chalon-sur-Scone, Fontaines, Sennally-le-Grand, Crilly, Bearne, Neut St. Georges,  Malain La Roche.</p>
