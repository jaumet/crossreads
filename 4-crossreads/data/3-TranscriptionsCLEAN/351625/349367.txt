  
 hospitals but I will be able to go out in the afternoons & buy stuff so I wont do too bad then.  I will have to finish now as my old fingers are getting stiff.  I have to write with my forefinger & thumb which is pretty awkward. 
 Give my love & kisses to all & whips for your self. 
 From Your loving Son Douglas
