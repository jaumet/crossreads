<p>Friday 18 February, 1916</p>
<p>Had two trips over to the right half of the 20<sup>th</sup> Batt for another gun &amp; tripod, we saw some fine desert scenery&nbsp;round Australia Hill.</p>
<p>In the evening we moved camp &amp; I was put in a different tent to Mac &amp; Bernie, it feels strange being away from them.</p>
<p>Two of our chaps, &quot;Sis&quot;&nbsp;Ellis &amp; Bingham had a fight, Bingham won. It is the first fight we have had in the M.G.S.</p>
