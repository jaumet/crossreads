I cut my finger (little one) pretty severely today on a piece of tin tonight it is very painful hot hope it dont get bad on me, I also have a heavy cold in the head but Thank Goodness it has not settled on my chest
You wouldn't believe what a difficulty we have in keeping any thing here for the rats, the place simply swarms with them, they are so bold that they will scarcely get out of your way, they tear great holes in your blankets eat your clothes equipment, even while you are lying down in them of a night, when you are sleeping they simply run all over you
