<p>Monday 7 July 1919<br/>Very dull all day. Went to Belgrave Sq. but they can't help me cos I'm on N.M.E. Went &amp; saw Carroll. Finish up on Wednesday. Met Ernie at 4 pm &amp; we went to Harrods &amp; bought a cake for Claire. Bonny too. Took her to tea there &amp; then had a hair cut &amp; went out to Maries. Left there early &amp; went home &amp; packed.</p>
<p>Tuesday 8 July 1919<br/>Finished packing &amp; then to the bank. Got the 11 am train to Brighton. Janet got the whole afternoon off so we were OK. We went out Dyke Road way. Went back to town for dinner then on to the beach finishing up getting the 9.50 back to town. Not [indecipherable] if isn't the last time I'll see her here.</p>
