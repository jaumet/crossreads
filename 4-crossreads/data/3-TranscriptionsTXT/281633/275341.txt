 morning by a French Gamekeeper.  As soon as the crews arrived two of our fellows Austin &amp; another, Ridley, went out with Rifles but could not find the Froggy.  If they did I firmly believe they woud have shot him dead.  Steve has been buried &amp; a Cross is being made for him.  I am still roosting in my Bunk.  Cannot put my foot to the ground. 
 25/11 My Foot is still bad, but I can hobble around with a stick.  I was called up for orderly room to-day &amp; informed that I would have to go to Hospital as we are going to move in two or three days &amp; I will not be able to march.  I said nothing but intend to hang out until I am kicked out. 
 Thursday 28/11 There is a "Purphy" floating about to the effect that the 1st &amp; 4th Divisions are out on strike.  The yarn runs that after they arrived about Strasbourg they were put on Salvaging Barbed Wire.  They soon got sick of that &amp; knocked off saying they had captured enough prisoners to do all that.  For punishment they were sent on a 12 miles route march.  After reaching their destination they were ordered to march back but refused:  finally motor lorries were sent out to bring them back. 
 7.12.18 The ancle is still very weak but I managed to walk half way to St. Ouen yesterday. With reference to the above mentioned "Purfy" I don't believe the 1st &amp; 4th Divs. reached Strasbourg at all.
