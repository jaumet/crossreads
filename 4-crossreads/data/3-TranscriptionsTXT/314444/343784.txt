a howitzer shell coughed its way overhead and a battle-plane circled slowly in the clouds, like a huge bird of prey - watching and waiting!
We will go back again now to the train and to the Rhone Valley. Two very interested men gazed out on emerald green fields, vinyards gardens and orchards - on old grey castles and towns reposing peacefully on the banks of the river - on a mountain capped with snow which stood majestically over all, and this thought went through the minds of both - "France is indeed a country a man would gladly die to save" - and I am sure that every Australian soldier now in France is fighting with even greater bravery and vigour than he did at Anzac, which made him world famous.
Yours Very Sincerely - Warren.
