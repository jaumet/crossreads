Report at 1.30 where they kept us fool around from one offic to anoth till about 1 , then we went to a Red X Room where a chap gave us a sausag roll , and stale bun and a mouth of cold tea in a cup . Various notic hung on the wall of the Hut inform us that this " splendid repast " was given to us by the Aust Red X .
