<p>being plenty to do. Slept on deck again after a busy day.</p>
<p>This trip will be different from the preceding one as nearly all the chaps in our ward can wash and care for themselves. Only 3 cases require wet dressings and two, dry. I am doing thee and enjoy it finely. One is a head wound, the patient's head being shaved to enable keeping the cut clean and the process of dressing is more painful to him than to either of the other two who are suffering from shrapnel wounds in the leg.</p>
<p>We have 27 to care for but they are all fine chaps and will not cause much worry I am sure, partly, I suppose, because they are all so delighted at going home that they are easily pleased.</p>
<p>November 5th: -<br/>Our first in the Red Sea and a scorcher at that. I am glad that our ward is so cool for the chaps below sweated all day &amp; work I know, is not pleasant under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Slept on deck.</p>
<p>November 6th: -<br/>Hot in the extremes &amp; work made very uncomfortable. We perspired freely all day but fortunately there was not a great deal to do so we did not feel it as some of the others did.</p>
<p>Off duty from 5 pm for the night which was fearfully close and thereby preventing us from sleeping soundly.</p>
