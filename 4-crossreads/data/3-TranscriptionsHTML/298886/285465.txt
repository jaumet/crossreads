<p>was taken making it about 13 miles. The travelling today was good. There was a fine cool breeze blowing we did the journey right out without the usual break at midday. and got here at 12.30</p>
<p>19th March. Sunday 1916</p>
<p>Arrived at TAHTA at about 1pm Short March Sun very hot and no shade trees in the Camping ground. Went for a walk in the Native City. It consists of mostly mud brick houses and there is a perfect labyrinth of streets running &ndash; as Mark Twain Says. "Every which way" a regular human warren The usual native stuff for sale Very smelly for the <strike>most</strike> greater part. If you want to buy any article from a shop a crowd collect immediately and they<br/>are all offering advice. &amp; all helping one to make the purchase For instance I wanted to buy a pint pot to drink out of. And as soon as I pulled up at the shop I pointed to a string of them hanging from the ceiling. Immediately the usual crowd collected and were all telling the shopman that I wanted one of those pint pots. The shopman took one from the string and at least half a dozen grabbed it &amp; passed it from one to the other admiring it and all with the same breath told me it would cost 2 piastres They totally ignored the shopman as though</p>
