 'Wimbledon' Potts Point 1 May 1917 
 My dear Fry, I want you to know of our sorrow and sympathy, but I can't put them into words. At a time like this one feels what a helpless thing friendship is, and yet when I was passing through the dark waters nothing helped me so much as the clasp of an old friend's hand. God help the poor Mother. 
 Yours very sincerely David Ferguson
