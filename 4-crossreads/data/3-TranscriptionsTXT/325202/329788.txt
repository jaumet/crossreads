preliminaries over we repaired to the bath room originally the laundry wash house The floor was covered with tubs filled with hot water from a hose in which we had our bath
Finished that we went under a hot shower & then a cold plunge dresses into our clean underclothing & pressed tunics etc & we came out feeling as fit & fresh as possible
Bac St Maur Railway Station was shelled this morning & a number of our waggons which were drawing supplies had to make a hurried exit luckily no one was hit.
