<p>This address is quite sufficient &amp; will serve equally as well for either France or Palestine, for I am absolutely confident that we will be into it again before another 3 months has passed.<br/>Am gradually getting together a fine set of aerial photos; I am a bit scared of sending them per post, as I have not got the negatives to many of them &amp; should be very sorry if they were lost at sea.  If we get our moving orders soon, I purpose leaving</p>
