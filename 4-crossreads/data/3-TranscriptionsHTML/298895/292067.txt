<p>Wednesday 9th May<br/>   Handed over my duties altho' final orders for the move have not yet arrived.  Weather fine.  Papers give a slight British reverse also news of the Nationalist Party's win in Australia.  Had a go at cricket also at Badminton the Q.M. producing a set, some game.  Mail from Australia more papers than letters for me however.  Our deaths in last stunt now total 4, all fine fellows two of my section &amp; two being orderlys for the Sgt's mess.  My section suffered the worst as usual.<br/>Thursday 10th May<br/>   Fine day, rain in the evening.  More casualties in an Amb, one man killed in the transport &amp; a horse or two wounded also two motor Ambulances blown up, one riddled and a Sgt Symes of paper fame in Melbourne killed in one of them.  I last saw him at Lemnos.  The cars were hit standing in front of the Main D.S.  Orders out</p>
