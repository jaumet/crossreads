<p>30 April, 1916<br/>Romania [Romani]<br/>We had to shift our lines down into the low ground this morning, it was a good idea but every officer wanted the lines put his own way &amp; the consequence was that we had to shift them several times.  they did not have them down when I left camp.  I had to come out to No 3 observation post with four men, I was glad to get out of the way.  It is not much chop here though on this hill the sand blows continually.  The other day the crest of the hill rose 4 feet owing to the sand which was blown there.  One can get a glimpse of the old Medditereanan from the hill</p>
