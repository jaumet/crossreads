 Tuesday Jan. 28th Left Agimont 7-30 a.m. walked to Heerr Agimont station through the snow, train left at 8-30 for Namur, line follows the River Meuse almost all the way.  Passed big lots of german railway stocks, guns, wagons, motors, engines etc.  Everything covered with snow.  Arrived Namur 11 a.m. and had a wander round the town.  A very large place, big buildings and lots of people about.  Got the train for Brussels 1-30 p.m., arrived 4 p.m. in the snow.  No trams running, men on strike, had to walk a couple of kilos to Y.M.C.A., had tea and a brush up then went to pictures.  Met a Belgian interpreter and spent the evening with him, took me round and showed me parts of the city.  Arrived back at Y.M. at 10 p.m. and went to bed, tired out.  Slept in between sheets!  First time since landing in France. 
 Wednesday Jan. 29th Up at 7-30, was hoisted out, not allowed to sleep any longer.  Had breakfast then wandered round the streets having a look at the buildings.  Had my photo taken.  "Some dog".  The Y.M.C.A. building originally belonged to Fritz and was run as a general store, it's a glorious place, every convenience, all the pillars are of marble and walls
