<p>Out in the Dust<br/>25th Oct 1917</p>
<p>Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines to let you know that I am quite well &amp; trust that you are both the same &amp; I am just writing these few lines as we are told that this is the last chance we will have of writing for at least three weeks.</p>
<p>Well take every care of your self &amp; do not worry about me as I am alright as what is to be will be &amp; worring will do no good at all. Tell Birts Wife I had no time to write her a note or else I would have, but I will write to you all as soon as ever I get the chance. I am afraid we have no chance of getting our mail before we move out, I would have liked to have heard from you &amp; Nell.</p>
<p>I have not recieved the parcel Nell sent or the one that Rodgers sent for you, we will not recieve them now till we get settled again. I will write again on the very first chance I get. Well I must close with wishing you all A Merry Xmas &amp; A Happy New Year God Bless &amp; Take care of You. Good Bye for the Present</p>
<p>I remain your<br/>ever loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>Kisses for you<br/>X X X X X X<br/>X X X X X X<br/>X X X X X X</p>
