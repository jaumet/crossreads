<p>Bapaume <br/>26/3/17<br/>Work on the Town Hall proceeded apace and saw some men still alive brought out &ndash; one walked off nonchalantly.  At lunchtime the 7th Bde HQ dugout blew up and buried four men   we had to put parties on then &ndash; bad ammonal fumes.  During the morning visited the church which evidently had been constructed of a poor soft stone.  In the vestry were many old vestments lying on the floor and a little of religious books &amp; tracts.  Many copies of a pastoral letter protesting against the building of some public buildings in such a manner as to wall the church in.  The church is completely wrecked.</p>
<p>From here we proceeded to a scarped hilly cliff covered prettily with fir trees.  Fine artillery dugouts &amp; ingenious O.P.'s hidden in trees scaled by ladders &ndash; all branches loped off the back of tree.  From here splendid observation could be obtained in all directions.  Bapaume nothing like as badly knocked about as Ypres.  To the cemetery and again saw the monuments etc.  The splendid way they have looked after the graves of their dead soldiers is a credit to them</p>
