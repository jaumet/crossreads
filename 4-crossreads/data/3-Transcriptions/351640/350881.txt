As compared with the Australian, the man from the old land has little capacity for looking after himself, he has been kept so much in one groove for the greater part of his that he cannot get out of it, and in varying viscisitudes he soon comes to the end of his resources, it is somewhat of a handicap for a soldier, many of those returning have hardly a piece of equipment remaining, all having been left on the battle fields of the peninsula, even the Australian is content to get away himself and bothers very little about his goods and chattles, the only trophies they bring are rifle cartridges, they are easily carried in the pockets, there may be in the mind of each man a certain amount of satisfaction at getting away but slightly wounded.</p>

Kissed each of the pictures before putting them back in the envelope.</p>
