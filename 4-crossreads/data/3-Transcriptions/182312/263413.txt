<p>own make.&nbsp; The people themselves and their wares were so clean look-</p>
<p>ing that everybody bought from them a thing they would never think of</p>
<p>doing from the filthy pedlars of Egypt.&nbsp; The troop train from Mar-</p>
<p>seilles was an eye-opener.&nbsp; One of the chaps stepped it out and she</p>
<p>was 350 yards long.&nbsp; If you had asked a N.S.W. Railway man to haul</p>
<p>it from Sydney to Strathfield he would have taken a fit.&nbsp; He would</p>
<p>probably have wanted to split in into four and then/<sup>take </sup>all&nbsp; day to get</p>
<p>them over the journey.&nbsp; One engine hooked on to us and hauled us</p>
<p>over the Mountains which run along the back of Marseilles.with&nbsp; the</p>
<p>greatest of ease.&nbsp; The train was very comfortable, the men being</p>
<p>accommodated in box carriages with cushions on the seats, eight men</p>
<p>being allotted to a compartment.&nbsp; The Officers were in first-class</p>
<p>cars, 4 to a compartment.&nbsp; For the first hour after leaving Marseilles</p>
<p>the line keeps within view of the Ocean, and the scenery is really</p>

<p>amongst the brilliant green of the trees they make a picture rarely</p>
<p>seen in Australia where the slaughtering of trees spoils the effect.</p>
<p>All this country is divided up into small farms each with its quaint</p>
<p>white-walled, red-roofed homestead.&nbsp; After crossing the coast range</p>
<p>the line follows up the valley of the Rhone.(I must admit my ignorance</p>
<p>for I had an idea that the Rhone was in Germany , a sort of sister</p>
<p>river to the Rhine).&nbsp; For magnificent scenery, I canrecommend this</p>
<p>daylight journey from Marseilles Northwards.&nbsp; The Rhone runs fairly</p>
<p>fast over numerous weirs and under frequent bridges; snow capped</p>
<p>mountains rise up abruptly sometimes within a few hundred yards of</p>
<p>the river.&nbsp; The scene constantly changes from rugged grandeur to</p>
<p>peaceful pasture country and was a source of constant wonder to our</p>
<p>troops.&nbsp; We were treated with great kindness by the people on the</p>
