 Dear Mum,  This is our Picture Show at Heliopolis. I saw ours, because we generally go once a week. We nearly always sit below the Pillar which is Marked. The tram is.  on its the way to Cairo & in 5 minutes will pass over Gates. Do you not think that the Buildings are lovely? We are having a very easy time now. With  120 men we came away to treat 1000 men & with that staff we managed to treat 2500 at one time. Now with 45 reinforcements we only have 450 so you can imagine what an easy time we have. I am feeling O.K. With plenty of good tucker & very little work, we are sure to feel well. Of course when these Patients go we will have to go somewhere too. So we are living in Hope of a trip very soon. How are you keeping? I suppose you have had your usual asthma & lumbago & heart trouble. Whatever you do: take things easy because we want many happy times together yet.  Harry 
 2 9/7/16 Dear Mum, This is a little Palace representing a Hindu Temple which the Belgian Architect Count built but never lived in. It is right at the farthest end of Heliopolis on a Hill & the Pyramids are easily seen although some miles away. An Arab caretaker shewed me over it for 1 P.T. Northing for nothing. It is not completed inside. All the statues & bronze figures are still on the floor ready to be set up. there is a winding marble staircase that leads right to the top of the tower. Just below this place is the Home of the Sultan's Mother. When his Mother is residing there, He goes out every night to dine with Her at 6.30 pm. she is away at present at one of his other Palaces/ He is a rich man & a Christian. He only has one wife. Well, Mum Dear I will write a short letter as well as these cards perhaps tomorrow. Love to all  Harry
