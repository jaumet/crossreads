July, 1915Tuesday 6The "Kiwi" Lancers as the L.H. were called are now in "Shorts" & "Puttees" I send you a snapshot of myself a la Tommy - We could do with all the good station men from the Back country -. MEN ARE WANTED, not writers or BoozersSorry I cannot give you more Military News but dare not so keep off the Topic, but we are not progressing as we should & there are so many poor fellows crippled & broken for life - Nothwithstanding our men give the Turks Gramophone Selections at times, trenches only 20 yards apart then Hell. Poor light Horse what a difference from what we expected. However, more power to us to be able to do it.
