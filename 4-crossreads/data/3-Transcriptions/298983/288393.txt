<p>with our Gass Helmets on &amp; got through without any trouble, In fact it does not seem very dangerous stuff, Not as bad as the H.E. shells although they can lob very close &amp; do no harm</p>
<p>Sunday 10th March<br/>A change of programme went out at 10 PM 3 of us stayed until 3 AM putting in iron reinforcements for the concrete. A cake &amp; sox from Aunt Mima today</p>
