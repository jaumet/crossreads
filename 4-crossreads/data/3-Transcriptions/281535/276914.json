<p>19/4/19<br/>Paris<br/>Dinner to Arrigonis and along the crowded boulevards for a while. Gay crowds in all the cafes. To Folies Bergeres and got into the promenade &ndash; a poor show but rather good stage effects. Girls wear nothing on their backs above their waists and only two narrow bands in front.</p>
