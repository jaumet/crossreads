Wednesday 20 November
Very busy to-day in anticipation of moving to-morrow, the beginning of our march to Germany. Very foggy cold.
Thursday 21 November
Beautiful day at 9.30 we began our move to Germany, the first stage to Mazinghien about 8 miles being marched to-day. We are now at Mazinghien, a village badly knocked about. Rumours are rife that W.M. Hughes has objected to our going to Germany that the move is being cancelled we are going Home at early date.
