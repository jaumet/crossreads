<p>which we had no time to bury The hour was late and the reinforcements were reported coming to the aid of their Compatriots. The real truth about this Rafa stunt was that the G.O.C. found that the Turkish position was too strong to be taken and orders were hastily sent out to retire. The 5th Mounted Brigade got the order and retired accordingly back to Sheikh Zowond about 10 miles Our Brigade [the 1st] were getting the order when they were just fixing their bayonets preparatory to charging the Turkish positions. When the Turks saw the bayonets coming too close they they promptly threw down their rifles and up went their hands The New Zealanders away around the other side did not get the order and they too were closing in on "Jacko" much to his anxiety and the Turks around that portion of the redoubt also "Skied the Towel". When our Brigade saw the way things were going they refused to comply with the order and so saved the situation and when the New Zealanders did eventually get the order to retire they had Jacko beat and so no one with the exception of the 5th mounted [Yeomanry] Brigade obeyed the order. One might put it down to the impetuosity of the Colonial Troops but why obey such an order when victory complete and decisive was within reach?</p>
