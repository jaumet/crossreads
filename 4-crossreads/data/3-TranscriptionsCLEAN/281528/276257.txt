28/3/18 - La Basse Villeline.  Some runner.  Cursing sliding and falling in the mud we reached No. 9 post dug in between the sleepers of a railway & esconsced [ensconced ?] in an ruined railway truck.  We had a patrol out in front.  On the left is a fair sized lagoon.  Minnies were hurtling over sending up clouds of mud & water.  Visited all the posts & found all the men uniformly cheerful and happy.  On the right they told me "'es only gotter grey whiskered old bloke here who rides up and down firing off flares".  A few flicks of m.g. fire.  Did not reach H.Q. until 2 a.m.
