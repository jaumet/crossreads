<p>Sun. 17th June<br/>The first shot gashed a hole amidships abt 4 feet above the water line &ndash; the flame from the shell rose right over the funnel.</p>
<p>For some time the shells were directed amidships.   The gunnery was apparently poor &ndash; one shell burst in the water between the two vessels when the distance was only a couple of hundred yards.</p>
<p>At about 11.30 am shells were put into nos 1 and 2 holds &ndash; the cargo of which burst into flames.</p>
<p>The "Wolf" circled slowly around the "Wairuna" which now listed heavily to port with smoke pouring from her hatches.</p>
<p>A couple more shots finished her &ndash; at about 1230 p she slowly settled over on her side, the burning cargo bursting from her hatches as she went under.</p>
<p>The funnel snapped off as it went down.</p>
<p>In all 16 shells were fired at her.</p>
