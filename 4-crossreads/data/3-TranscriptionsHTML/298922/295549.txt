<p>Monday 27 August 1917</p>
<p>Inspected by G.O.C. Horses very poor &amp; eating SAND like in a drought &amp; like the men. They are stale &ndash; (LILIES). Desert "Lilies" are in bloom a very pretty white bloom about 3 in. in diameter. A sweet scented bulb &amp; I may be able to post you some.</p>
<p>Am anxiously waiting news re my application for leave &amp; hardly dare expect it will be granted.</p>
<p>[The remainder of the page crossed through.]<br/>Will go via ITALY &amp; FRANCE if it comes off. 6 weeks I applied for. When the next stunt takes place here, the Turkswould know all about it before hand &ndash; Their flying men come over &amp; congratulate ours on any decoration the very next day. HOW DO THEY KNOW??</p>
