<p>February 28, 1916 Monday</p>
<p>71 wks from home</p>
<p>Revielle at 6.30</p>
<p>Had a trip to Hassan Pasha &amp; Samalut this morning, the bike is still going beautifully although I can't get time to give it a complete overhaul. Mels machine is anything but good, the maggy is up the pole, the armature is brushing on the fields &amp; is consequently mis-firing, we pulled it all to pieces but could not rectify same, no tools, his clutch is also gone the buffers are worn down flush &amp; will have to be replaced.</p>
<p>Our instructor turned up in time &amp; we are getting along fine, went to bed at 10.30 tired &amp; hot as weather is again hot.</p>
<p>February 29, 1916 Tuesday</p>
<p>Leap year day</p>
<p>Revielle as per usual</p>
<p>My horse is looking splendid again &amp; is in fine fettle, spent a very quiet day, nothing doing at all the aeroplane that went up this morning was shelled &amp; came under heavy machine gun fire from the Bediouns, he in return gave them a few eggs which they don't seem to appreciate.</p>
<p>At 9.30 got warned to report at HQ with machine for dispatches to Naylet-el-abet, left at 10, got there at 11.10 after a rough [indecipherable] &amp; to make matters worse my lamp wouldn't burn, left again at 11.30 &amp; got home 50 minutes later, saw two foxes &amp; hundreds of rats.</p>
<p>Turned in at 12.45</p>
