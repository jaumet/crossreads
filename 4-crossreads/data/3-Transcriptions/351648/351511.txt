<p>And how is the Authoress tonight ma Cherie?  I hope flourishing &amp; happy &ndash; you lucky dog!  I picture you to myself reveling in the surf at Manly to which spot you told me in your last that you were going for the summer &amp; my envy knows no bounds, here in this dog darned hole of mud &amp; snow the yearning for a day of warmth is very great.  However everything comes to those who wait is a true saying, I'm finding it so myself even &amp; have no cause to complain as my luck seems to have turned lately (&amp;here's where I blow my own trumpet) seeing that I got a Military Cross about New Year &amp; have just got my Majority.  I see that I shall have to swank a bit &ndash; what?  I certainly didn't do anything to deserve either, &amp; my good fortune I attribute entirely to that fickle jade "Luck" with a capital L.  So in future please address me as Major Josh &amp; be more respectful!  No thought much less</p>
