at a fair pace when my horse shied violently  pitched head first into a culvert about 5 ft deep.Luckily I managed to free my feet fell over the back of the horse. I rolled clear of his heels just in time, as he immediately began to lash out.I got him up after a little trouble  he is no worse for his fall. I galloped him all the way home  took it out of him.The Horses are all very fresh on account of the large grain rations allotted them. For weeks  weeks they get nothing but oats occasionally a little bran with of course, plenty of green stuff.There was a fairly heavy bombardment today, to which the Germans replied.Our waggons were under shell fire today, one exploding about 350 yards from us.Late last night I again witnessed an air fight. A Taube managed to sneak over our lines  was immediately fired out by anti-aircraft guns from every village he passed over. It was very pretty to see. He eventually retired when one of our planes went up to meet him. An hour later he was felled over the British lines.
