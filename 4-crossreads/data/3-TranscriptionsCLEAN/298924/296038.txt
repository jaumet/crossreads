Tuesday 25 February 1919RafaKhamsin blowing hard - our men have nothing left of equipment & the drill is now ABC Infantry - like my Diary rather uninteresting, but one has to listen to a "Talker" and a man need not & read.  Lectures are also given by poor Amateur lecturers, the men cursing all the time - it is a great waste of time for every one.  One Officer who has been drunk for 3 weeks is detailed to give a lecture to N.C.Os. on the duty!!! of N.C.Os. in the field.  Can you not imagine the Bolshie feelings of those men.
