<p>22 April, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Revielle as per usual.</p>
<p>Went up like a lamb to the slaughter this morning &amp; had a pretty gruelling time, the injections settled me for I couldn't stand the stuff &amp; I went clean out to it a couple of times consequently he only drew three &amp; I have to go again on Wednesday. Felt pretty ill all day, I was foolish to go so soon after the inoculation &amp; I guess I wont be caught the next time.</p>
<p>Started the Pitch last night &amp; secured a good spot to play on if only the niggers keep off it.</p>
<p>Horses went out as usual &amp; Norm took out Pards lunch for I couldn't hold a bar let alone see the road.</p>
<p>Wrote letters &amp; then turned in early 8 pm.</p>
<p>Sohag</p>

<p>Revielle as per usual</p>
<p>My phyg pretty sore this morning &ndash; had to go on duty up at H Q's with the bike, fooled around all day &amp; made further arrangements for Tuesday, everything promises to go off OK so far experienced difficulty in raising a piano. Hal &amp; I filled in our papers today &amp; everything is OK this time thanks to Mr Smith.</p>
<p>Horses &amp; men went out to the palms as usual, nothing to report from that centre. Weather is still warm &amp; likely to be it registering 129&deg; in the shade again today.</p>
<p>Camel Corps &amp; Transport cleared out today for other destinations, Plague is supposed to have broken out at Assuit &amp; members of the C.C. are in quarantine for a fortnight.</p>
