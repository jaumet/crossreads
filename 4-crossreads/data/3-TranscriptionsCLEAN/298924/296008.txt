Sunday 26 January 1919Divisional Field Officer today.  C.O., N.Z.M.R. objected to being inspected!!Heard report of Anzac garrison.  Trenches there still in good order, olive trees grown again, Xs & Headstones removed but graves not violated, in fact Turks had fenced some in.  Few identity Discs found in no man's land & a good many had trophies found in among the bones.  Most of the officers got up to Constantinople & were well received as Americans!!!  The French garrisoning Gallipoli were most hospitable & I understand the Australians have left a good name behind them.Got leave, off tonight!
