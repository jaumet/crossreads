  
 We motored round London & saw Trafalgar Square, the Abbey & some other places.  We caught the 6.15 a.m. train to Tidworth next morning.  We were supposed to be in camp at midnight on the previous night, so we were already over leave.  We were not going to wait 2 hours at the Junction, so we motored from Andover Junction to arrive before 10 a.m. as the rest of the unit were leaving for Bulford that morning.  We were going well until the tyre of the motor blew out about 3 miles from Tidworth.  We were delayed 25 minutes & arrived a quarter of an hour after our boys had left.
