<p>13 November 1914<br/>Saturday [Friday] Crossed the Line</p>
<p>Revielle at 6.<br/>Awoke to the air of Neptunes orchestra &amp; expected great things through the day &amp; we weren't disappointed either punctually at 1030 the police drew forth the first batch of victims including Teddy &amp; 4 other officers everything went off well &amp; some caused more fuss than others. The HMS Hampshire joined us today from Colombo she is a first class cruiser with 6 in guns &amp; has now taken up her position at the head of the new lines. The New Zealanders &amp; the Karros left the main body to steam on to Colombo to coal up &amp; to [indecipherable] no 1 hold on account of the leak as we expect to sight land tomorrow after none for a fortnight also there's a chance of fruit also letters. While steaming ahead tonight the [indecipherable] was seen to stop &amp; lower a boat she dropped a man overboard but they got him again. Received mess from King asking us to be "home" for Christmas due to arrive 15th.</p>
<p>14 November 1914<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Out of sight of other ships only the Jap on the horizon another horse dies in No 6 hold today cast overboard &amp; fouls the screw. Teddy parades the men &amp; lectures them with regard to beer all beer, eds stand out &amp; are issued with chits &amp; a corporal put on canteen to prevent second helping. The New Zealanders have been practicing shooting all day at floating targets. Another infantry horse takes bad &amp; is raised up onto deck for fresh air. Concert takes place &amp; as usual is good but not long enough. Played with Corp [indecipherable] my heat in chess but lost to superior play. Receive news of [indecipherable] captured also that we are running into Monsoon &amp; later vivid lightning is seen dead ahead. Great expectations exist among the troops on the prospect of sighting land on the morrow. Fred comes out of the hospital<br/>Bed at 9.</p>
