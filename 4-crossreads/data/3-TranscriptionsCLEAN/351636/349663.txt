 Dear Mr. Layton, I am sending an application to you from Mrs. Jones who wishes to have her debts paid. 
 You will see she is much better off than some of our women so I am not sure whether you will consider hers a case worthy of assistance but she appears to have got into difficulties with her payments during illness - 
 Yours sincerely E. M. Wallack
