Broken leg. At this moment of writing one of our airmen brought down a Fritz aeroplane not far away. A thrilling sight. Met Bert Francis on the 3"green" across from Flers. First meeting since leaving Aus. Hardly recognised him for his unshaven face. We are all dirty &amp; unkempt. Weather is fine for a wonder.</p>
