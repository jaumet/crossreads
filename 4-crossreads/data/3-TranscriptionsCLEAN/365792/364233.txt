  
 May 29 long ramble too, & although its dead quiet one doesn't mind that in the least. It's a relief too to get away from the squabbling of the Tommies & all the red tape. 
 30 Slept real well after a good shower last night. Pratted my frame through the door & got a job. You bet I handled that mop to some purpose. First came the brush on a long handle then two rubber scrapers - also on long handles & last of all the mop. Each bucket of water was diluted with fenile, & we did the job in no time. Played croquet nearly all the afternoon, but was licked 2 out 3 times. Jolly good games they were too. Slight rain but nothing to speak of. Wrote several letters - incl one for another chap. Everything one wants here, Library, Billiards & Concert Rooms, Canteen Croquet Lawn, Red x store etc. 
 31 Dodged toil this mng, & went for a bit of a stroll round the grounds
