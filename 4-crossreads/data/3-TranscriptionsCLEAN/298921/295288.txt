  
 November, 1915 Thursday 25 Our men are happy tho' cold I have made a Terrace 10ft wide on the side of a Hill facing the Sea bright breezy & bracing but not too many hours of daylight now - The  K  has been to Greece we are all anxious to know what those chaps mean to do, "Sell us a Pup I think." From Imbros island came  cabbages  &  oranges , but not enough, however, "it is well with the child" & I am still about 12 stone 7 lbs by the Quartermasters Steelyards. One little Steamer has been salvaged & I see is afloat once more they have a rough time these little trawlers.
