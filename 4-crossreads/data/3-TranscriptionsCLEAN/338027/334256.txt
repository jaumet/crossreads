We buy mostly tinned stuffs & preserves.  There was a big demonstration last night on at 4 a.m. in the morning extending from the right to the left along the whole front.  These demonstrations are done to attract the Turks attention when a few brigades of Austs start cooeeing & yelling like mad the Turks think we are charging & move their trenches this prevents them rushing reinforcements to the real attack.  Every one had to stand to arms but I was back between the blankets as soon as it was over.  The monitors bombarded furiously. 
 Saturday, 16 October, 1915 The last page of my beloved little diary, you have been my constant companion & solace day by day for twelve long months and now you terminate, I rec a parcel to-day containing books etc but the expected diary for next year was not in it. How ever I am going right on with my diary as I realize what it will be in years to come. 
 Sick parade getting bigger 57 paraded to-day, but mostly dressings it was 11.30 before we finished.  Further good news from France and as I now close my book for 1914-1915 my earnest wish is that the next date next year will not see me still writing, to-day I wrote a poem to my friends mother and a copy is in the back of this book.
