<p>Friday, 1st February 1918<br/>Rose 7 a.m., breakfast &amp; then Palace Gardens &amp; beautiful La France roses gathered &ndash; walked to Bella Donna's house, shopped, then sailed away on the Nile till time to pack &amp; so ends one wonderful week in the "land of long ago". We watch the sunset from the garden steps &amp; say farewell perhaps forever to one friend who must off to the war again so soon.  Train 7 p.m. dining car meal Pt. 30, sleeper Pt. 75 (i.e. 15/-), all comfortably fitted up &amp; very smooth travelling.  In my purse I have Pt. 46 when leaving Luxor, arriving Cairo Pt. 14, but it is enough &amp; the coin well spent in learning so much.  Assouan is never fading for its beauty &amp; Luxor with its wonderful temples.</p>
