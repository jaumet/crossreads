<p>TELEGRAM.</p>
<p>From - Naval Board.<br />To - Vice Admiral Commanding.</p>
<p>From Minister of Defence to Vice Admiral Commanding.<br />Please inform Administrator with regard to his telegram to Chief of General Staff, 20th September.</p>
<p>It does not appear from the telegram whether terms set out are merely proposals or whether they are terms on which surrender has actually been accepted.&nbsp; Commonwealth Government considers terms as stated unduly advantageous to the enemy.&nbsp; Governor should be held as Prisoner of War and should not under any circumstances be allowed to return to Germany.&nbsp; Civil Officials whose services not required or who refuse to take oath of neutrality not allowed to return to Germany.&nbsp; Sufficient reasons for allowing surrender with Military Honours do not appear.</p>
<p>Payment of salaries of deported civil officers and travelling expenses of families to Europe appear unjustifiable.&nbsp; If terms mentioned are those which Governor and his forces has agreed to surrender and have actually surrendered different conditions arise.&nbsp; So far as conditions granted relate to surrender of forces and are conditions which Brigadier had authority to grant, they must be scrupulously observed.&nbsp; Government however not aware that Brigadier had authority to promise that any of enemy&#39;s forces or civil officers should be allowed to return to Germany in which case conditions are void and may be disregarded.</p>
