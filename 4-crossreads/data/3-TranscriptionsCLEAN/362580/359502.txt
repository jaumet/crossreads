Sister Hart (the one that was at Suez) is the sister in charge of this ward & she is an awfully nice girl, so everything in the garden is lovely.
Yesterday afternoon I was off duty.  It is a rule now that the patients fit to go for a little outing, go for a motor drive, once a week and a sister always goes with them.  I was asked if I would go.  So at 3 p.m. we left the Palace in a lovely motor car.  Five patients, dressed in loose kharki kaiki suits with bright red ties & a Sister in uniform with red cape - we had a most delightful 11/2 hours - motored to Sporting Club (Gheyiah) and had Afternoon tea which the boys thoroughly enjoyed.  I shouted them and it was a great pleasure.  We saw a Polo match which was splendid.  Returned
