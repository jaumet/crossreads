We came upon one place about 10' X 6 which we followed down to a depth of about 12 feet.    Then we came upon a slab of stone much the same as our kerbing stone about 6 X 5 by 4 inches thick.  We were able to shift this but were disappointed to find nothing but sand under it.  At one end we noticed a drive leading off, which we followed <strike>out</strike> up, &amp; after digging sufficient earth away I crawled in on my stomach &amp; with the light of a candle I found myself in a cave affair about 8 feet across.  In one corner was a complete set of bones, so old that they crumbled to ashes between the fingers.  Beside them were the remains of an animal's jaw bone &amp; skull, as though the favourite cat or dog had been buried with him.  It was here that I found these beads at least some of them, &amp; the balance I got after scraping round the edge of some other graves<br/>Some other chaps have got some fine things out of them- one got a beautiful scarab, another an alabaster doll &amp; basin.<br/>Must close now, with best love to you &amp; Mother<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
