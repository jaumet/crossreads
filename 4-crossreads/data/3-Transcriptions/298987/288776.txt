<p>around about 9 to see that we were all in bed &amp; some of them used to stick clothes &amp; things under the Blankets to make it look as if they were there</p>
<p>Thursday 27th<br/>Got 13 letters nearly all Aussies &amp; mostly April dates</p>
<p>Friday 28th<br/>Drew my clotheing &amp; was turned out on the hard World Walked to Sand Hills camp &amp; went through the formalities of Reporting Back. They would not own me in the Company I had left untill  I found a Groupe Orderly Room stuck away in the furthest corner &amp; reported there. Then was once more taken into the fold &amp; got blankets &amp; settled down in the Hut I left a week before &ndash; Wonder how many different lots of blankets I have had in the army There allwalys an element of uncertainty about them some all very small some thread bare some dirty but taken all round have been fairly fortunate</p>
