<p>V<br/>from dysentery and has gone to Hospital at Cyprus. I expect the excessive heat of Egypt at this time of the year has been responsible.<br/>Forgot to mention at beginning of this letter that Father's letter of 14th June reached me one day during the week, as usual most welcome.<br/>Have heard nothing of Sis or Ted yet, but next English mail I hope will bring me some news of them. Toomey is still O.K. as is Chas Lecky. The latter's Battalion has I hear suffered the most of any taking part in the recent attack.<br/>As time is short I am afraid this scrappy note must suffice for this week. With fondest love to yourselves and Pat<br/>I am, ever your loving Son<br/>Terence</p>
