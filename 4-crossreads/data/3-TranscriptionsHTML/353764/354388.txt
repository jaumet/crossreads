<p>Rabbit Warren.  Hundreds of Trenches branching out &amp; running in all directions.  After going through the greater part of them &amp; inspecting the Barb wire entanglements, we marched West, across the Desert to the great pumping &amp; Sewerage Station which the British erected, to try &amp; cleanse Cairo, &amp; which needless to say is well guarded.<br/>We then turned homewards &amp; after a very trying march over the Desert arrived back in Camp very tired.  Fancy spending Anniversary Day like this, I wonder how you all spent yours.<br/>The boys are now making up for it however, by having a Sing Song in the Sergeants Mess.  We are also remodelling our Camp which will look very good when finished.</p>
<p>27.1.16<br/>Very cold &amp; raining off &amp; on all day.  Strange thing happened to-day.  One of our chaps (R Nutt) who was admitted to Hospital Suffering from Concussion of the Brain, &amp; who was Crazy at the time, slipped through the Hospital Guard &amp; returned to Camp.</p>
