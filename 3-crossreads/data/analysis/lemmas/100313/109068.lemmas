 22/1/18 Crieff The weather was quit beast . In the morn with Audrey Sheila Craig walk ( or rather slid ) along the frozen ici road and did some shop round the town ? a typic Scotch dull grey and emin respect place . To Ladi Mari 's Walk a pleasant path besid a stoni rush stream . This in fine weather would be a love spot but now is bleak and cold . Still we veri much enjoy our walk . Afternoon we sat round the fire talk and some local peopl came in to tea . The Revd Hunter Smith was there and his curious wife . After dinner the happi circl again sat round and we talk on everi subject imagin . To get into a home like this with a mother woman like Mrs Craig and dear honest girl like these is a veri true joy . I did enjoy it so much and we talk on until late .
