 17/10/17 Boulogne Everywhere the maple leaf was much in evidence. Our car tore along and a cold biting wind made us keep our heads down rather than allow any admiring of the scenery. Outside St Omer on the Eublinghen side is an old mill tower which reminds me of Bishop Hatto&#39;s castle. Just as we were about 30 kms. from Boulogne we ran into rainy conditions. The country hereabouts is very pretty and not much touched by the War. The road passes over high places and a wonderful scene is spread below &ndash; a gigantic basin of &quot;lanscape target&quot; country all chess boarded and criss crossed by hedges. Not far out of Boulogne our rear axle went phut and we had to come slowly into the town. Put up at the Terminus hotel. There were many nurses about and it was very good to hear English voices. Booked up a room for the others but ascertained that there is a train for Paris at 9 pm.
