is a pretty hard little lump so I have been xrayed but do not have the result. I have told you all these details as it looks bad on paper when they say wounded in leg thigh face. I would tell you lots more how I was wounded etc but I am always frightened Vol will stick something in the paper. Anyway I can tell you this much that I had twelve huns carrying three stretchers three were blown to atoms one an arm off another a leg off three others wounded. My mate, there were two of us had a wound in arm leg. I was bearing for the 20th Bn at the time. You see we always get attached to the infantry now when any stunts are on. Well Sis that is about all I can tell you as regards the war. I am glad to be out of it for a while as although we went out a few times
