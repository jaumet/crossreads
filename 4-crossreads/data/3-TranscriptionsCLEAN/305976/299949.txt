  
 Tuesday Dec 11 Taubes came over today observing & we saw a very fine air duel unfortunately no machines were brought down. Wednesday Dec 12 Taubes raided Ramley to day. Ramley with its tall spire & tower of the forty martyrs looks beautiful Must visit Ramley at first opportunity. Rechon is a quiet country village. Its principal products seem to be the wine industry, nuts & oranges. Some of the Orange groves are irrigated to perfection. One being camped here could easily forget that there was any War. The occasional visits of the Taubes however keep us
