of the New Zealand Brigade who however sprang upon "Jacko" at dawn and killed about 20 of him and wounded some others. They did not follow up they were ordered not to do so. It might seem ridiculous to send out about 5000 men with dozens of machine guns and a flock of aeroplanes just to kill about 20 men but had only one brigade gone out the probability is that they enemy might have given much trouble and this old caper of sending a boy on a mans errand has had its day especially with Australians We have been caught before.
A lot of the men were terribly sleepy on the return journey. The sun was hot and we were heavily weighted with our marching order. For my part I know I had my water bottle (full) Haversack with rations in it. Bandolier with 90 rounds of ammunition waist belt with bayonet and four pouches with 50 rounds in them making 140 rounds all told. a pair of field glasses a Telescope and a prismatic Compass. We reached Camp about 3.30 p.m. Thoroughly tired out. But it was an experience
The pack horse carrying the canvas horse trough got "bushed" and wandered over the face of the desert joining up after the sun got up.
