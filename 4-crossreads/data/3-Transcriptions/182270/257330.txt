<p>SATURDAY, JANUARY 18, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine. Went out to the Bank</p>
<p>with Kieth in the morning</p>
<p>&amp; had a walk round the city</p>
<p>All the crowd went to the Zoo</p>
<p>in the afternoon and I was</p>
<p>about the flat. Alan came</p>
<p>along later and went out</p>
<p>dancing. Kieth &amp; I fooled</p>
<p>round at night &amp; got to bed</p>
<p>fairly early.</p>
