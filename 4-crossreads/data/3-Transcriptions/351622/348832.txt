<p>early.</p>
<p>22 May 1916 Mon<br/>Plenty of work to-day as I am all on my own in the tent. Sgt Beattie the busker goes around with the phonograph news that Lieut Carrol wounded. Another one of the best gone. He was on patrol at the time. Played football after tea &amp; retired to bed [text continued at top of page]</p>
<p>23 May 1916 Tues<br/>Keith Harris comes to assist in the tent. Johnny Harper gets the measles &amp; is evacuated. All the Enmore boys have left this unit now. Gives me a bomb to mind which I kept in my pack in the billet. If the Ring goes off to-night it will just about do some damage.</p>
