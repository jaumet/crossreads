some armoured cars and the regt coming out to our rescue, but they were not needed. We only had five chaps slightly wounded so got off pretty light I think. When you get to the top of the mountains east of the Dead Sea you come on to a big table land of rich red soil, and there eems to be a lot of wheat grown up there - the few crops we saw looked splendid. It was quite cold up there and the season is easily a month or six weeks behind this valley, which is getting hotter every day. I was looking at the armoured car section today - all their big fighting cars are Rolls Royces, but all their transport and ammunition cars etc are Fords. I tell the chaps here that is shows the only car fit to work with the Rolls Royse is the Ford! I wonder if the Americans will bring out a Ford aeroplane. The Rolls Royce have some beauties and are now bringing out a whopper, I believe, with four, two hundred and fifty horsepower engines in here.
