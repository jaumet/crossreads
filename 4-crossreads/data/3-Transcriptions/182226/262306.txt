<p>Monday 11 October, 1915</p>
<p>Met Norm Matthews, he has been here six weeks &amp; is going to England, lucky chap.</p>
<p><s>Lord &amp; Lady Methuen&nbsp;with their daughter visited the hospital. They were very decent &amp; we were very pleased to see them.</s></p>
<p>Managed to borrow a bob off Norm, the first money I have had in my pocket for 2 months, it was truly the &quot;Breaking of the Drought&quot;.</p>
<p>We get paid 2/- per week here but we can get more when we go into the convalescent camp.</p>
<p>The situation in the Balkans is in a pretty serious condition. By the way things are going there will probably be a big upheavel there shortly. I hope that it turns out all right.</p>
