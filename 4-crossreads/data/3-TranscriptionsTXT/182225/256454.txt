1916   FRIDAY 1   DEC.
Fine but very foggy all day It was a great day for the 7​​th FAB. We got out to the artillery range by the "Bustard Inn" about 4 miles away by 10 AM & started our firing about 12.30. We did fairly well considering the rotten conditions. Carrol & Raymond were 7.0.0 & made a mess of things by sending rotten orders. We got back about 2.30 were in stables in afternoon. I was lead driver on the Firing Battery waggon
