<p>1917 MARCH</p>
<p>19 MONDAY</p>
<p>A cold rainy day &amp; blowing very</p>
<p>hard, especially towards</p>
<p>evening. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>ect all day. I went up</p>
<p>to the horse spraying place</p>
<p>at Armenti&egrave;res with a couple</p>
<p>of mangy horses to get them</p>
<p>sprayed. Heard of Jack</p>
<p>Walsh&#39;s death. Fritz scored</p>
<p>a direct hit on a Stokes</p>
<p>gun that he was working.</p>
