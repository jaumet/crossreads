Morning. Worked in the billets on specialist work and in the afternoon marched the men down to the Canal de Neuf Fosse for Aquatic sports. There was a good deal of rain which rather spoilt things. The Engineers put a pontoon across the Canal and it had to be slewed round occasionally to let barges pass. The banks were lined with men. It was cold work for the competitors who shivered with very few clothes on. An interesting item was the duck hunt where ducks were put in the water and swimmers had to catch them. One platoon secured 4 ducks. Had afternoon tea in a marquee borrowed from the Y.M.C.A. Later in the afternoon the men started to go away as things flagged and weather got worse but the affair was a break in the monotony. "Podgy"Kellaway returned from England today after 5 months over there at the T.B. After dinner had a long talk with Mademoiselle and little Marie who is very pretty and very petite for her full 15 years.
