<p>McGillivray and A51 Chilka have been in visual range since leaving port, and should the ship which was off watch be required for wireless the one that was on watch would signal by flags, to man the gear.  It was not till tonight at tea rime that I ate a full meal since leaving port, and the enjoyment of eating was exquisite.  Should imagine starving people usually do enjoy a well cooked meal after fasting for a week.  This is our last night in the Southern Ocean, for we round the Leeuwin tonight and enter the Indian ocean tomorrow.  Feeling O.K. again I take the opportunity of surveying my position and really it is not a bad one.  My duties are of the most pleasant, my accommodation if not superb is very good and comfortable, fellow officers</p>
