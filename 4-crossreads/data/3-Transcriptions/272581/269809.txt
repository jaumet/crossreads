<p>January 1916<br />The top of this Pyramid has been levelled off &amp; a pole has been erected to show the original height. On the way home we went via another route &amp; passed the Zoological Garden &amp; crossed over the River Nile. The Nile is a dirty looking river &amp; has hundreds of house boats on it &amp; has some very fine bridges across it. From the next day onwards we had to settle down to drill &amp; it was a strain too for we had had none since leaving Sydney. On the 27th we were inspected by Lt. General Birdwood the Commander of the Australian Forces. Next day I met Bert &amp; went for a walk &amp; at Night went to see him at No 2 Auxil. Hospital &amp; saw through it.</p>
<p>January &amp; February 1916<br />On the 30th I went out to see Ghezireh Hospital which is situated on the banks of the Nile &amp; is a fine building. For the next few day I just wandered round in my spare time looking mostly at the things which I&#39;d seen before. But on the 6th February I went to No 3 Auxil Hospital or it is also known as the Sporting Club &amp; is in Heliopolis. While there I had a good look round inside the wards &amp; round the grounds. The grounds are divided into a Polo field, football field, Tennis courts &amp; golf links &amp; all these are surrounded with beautiful hedges &amp; gum trees. I also went &amp; saw the Aerodrome the same morning &amp; saw Aeroplane</p>
