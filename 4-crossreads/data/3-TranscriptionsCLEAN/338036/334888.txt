  
 [24th Mar. contd] We subsequently learnt that Jim Sullivan had stopped a piece in his arm.  Sergt Butcher obtained one of the 'duds' half exploded a 5.9 thing & very thick too.  We are waiting for the Hun's next move.  At night a party of us went to Nieppe to see the N.Z. Follies of whom we had heard a good deal & they were excellent too.  It quite reminded me of Sydney Follies.  The orchestra was a star item - one piece they played The Eternal Walz" being particularly good.  During the performance we could hear shells bursting up the road.  However we got back after having spent an enjoyable night.
