September 1915Thursday 23Cool Wind. Our Section has been raised to full strength by green - horns out of the companies. I with the other older hands had some practice with the Heliograph.
Friday 24Fine Windy. Bad place for wind here. Seems as if it will never go down.   More Helio practice with Pte Townsend and Pte Bond. C. Coy of our Batt played B. Coy at Soccer. It finished one goal each. I played for C. Coy.
