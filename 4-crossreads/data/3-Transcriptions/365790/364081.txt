<p>II  First French Experiences<br/>The "Canada" arrived at Marseilles at noon on June 25th &amp; by the same evening all were entrained for the long train journey North which occupied 4 days.  The first real presentation of "La Belle France" to the eyes of all was deeply impressive and some conception penetrated the minds of the dullest as to what it was that France was fighting for.</p>
<p>After Detraining near Hazebrouck the battalion spent a few days at Lynde where final touches were added to the training within the sound of the guns.  On June [July] 9th after a three days march the battalion took up its quarters near Bae St Maur some 3 miles from the front line.  After a short spell at burying telephone cable the Battalion was ordered to build a mile of railway line to the front line in 3 nights.  This seemed at first hopeless owing to the amount of material to be got forward &amp; the number of small deep streams intersecting the country. However it was done in spite of the fact the during the second night the Hun carried out one of this periodical "strafes" then so common.</p>
<p>This line was to bring material up for use during the attack on July 19th which proved so disastrous.  Two Coys (A &amp; D) took part in this attack while a small party from 'C' Coy under Lt Whitfield maintained a supply of water to the attacking infantry.  Major Scott with 'D' Coy completed a sap across No Man's Land in the centre of the Divisional sector of attack while Lt Duke with a platoon of A Coy maintained a communication trench (V.C. Avenue) tho the work lay direct in the enemy barrage line. For the fortnight following this engagement the Battalion was fully occupied in repair work on the front line &amp; communication trenches.  'D' Coy were then detailed to carry out a large drainage scheme, the work requiring careful grading throughout.  The success of this scheme may be judged from the fact that during winter of 1916-17 tho' far more severe, the water did not rise above the duckboard level at all.</p>
