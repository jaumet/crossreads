<p>August 1915<br/>fatigue.  The mail was distributed in the afternoon.  I got letters from Violet Blair Kate &amp; Doug, also an "Illustrated War News"  Wrote a letter to Violet.  Had a yarn with Harold Jones at night.  He has been here a fortnight now with reinforcements for the 7th LH.  Went for a dip in the briny after tea.  We had a little rain during the night.  About 10 or 11 oclock there was a tremendous outburst of rifle &amp; machine gun fire, also bombs &amp; it lasted quite while.  Seemed to be on the left of the Lone Pine.</p>
<p>Friday 27th<br/>About stand-to in the morning there was another burst of fire.  Seems as if they are doing some scrapping on the left.  The weather is still cloudy &amp; cool.  We heard that Italy has declared war on Turkey &amp; that Greece &amp; Bulgaria may come in at any moment.  We won't be sorry</p>
