A parcel mail arrived today but will not be sorted till tomorrow. Patrol, escort parties etc. are detailed daily here & the Outpost work at night  but it practically the same routine daily. 
 9-12-16+ Sat 9th Had no luck with parcel mail today but the limber was sent over to Kilo 127 again this afternoon & returned with a couple of bags of letters & papers. Reports tonight state that enemy are busy & for patrols to El Aabash to be careful. An enemy 'plane flew over us today very high
