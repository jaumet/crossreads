<p>12-5-1918, Sunday<br/>Foggy, with rain in the morning.  Things extremly quiet.  A rather laughable incident occurred the other day.  Some of our Infantry captured a pig, away up forward.  They killed it, and were carting it down on a stretcher, when a General met them.  Another casualtie he asked, the diggers answered, yes.  The General then asked if he was dead.  They again answered yes.  The General saluted and rode on.  I saw another Infantryman regulating the traffic, rigged out in a top hat and evening dress coat.  During the last retreat, we must call it a retreat, some of the civilians got 20 minutes to get away</p>
