  
 L'Estrade to try & get more lamps tables etc.  From 4 till 8 we were busy when I managed to get some tea but from then on the cases slackened & I turned in at 11.30 only to be pulled out however at 12.30 for a gas alarm   nothing came of it so I returned to bed sleeping in my clothes & was called for breakfast between 7 & 8 A.M.  The cases we have had so far have been just typical cases some severe some not.  Antitetanus serum is injected in all Cases 
 Tuesday 18th July Had a steady day & fairly slack in the afternoon so spent some time in arranging the stock for each section.  Things working very well the men taking an interest in the work & we have contrived to make our show superior to the other ambulances around.  Kept going till 2.30 A.M. making a 19 hours day but did not feel unduly fatigued 
 Wednesday 19th Very little doing with wounded so had time to finish all arrangements for a big rush.  Had a rest between 10 & 12 A.M. which was just as well considering what came on later.  After dinner I walked along to the Divisional Baths & had a good dip which was a luxury indeed.  Then a few minutes after getting back the show commenced    all the day our artillery had been shelling
