<p>France<br/>22 July</p>
<p>My dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Really I think I'm suffering from loss of memory or am losing my grip or somethink as I really can't remember when I wrote last but I know I haven't written for a fortnight anyhow.  And you must not blame me anyhow as really I haven't had a hope of writing, we were very busy the last day at the old place &amp; then we moved a stage a day for 10 days &amp; then I had a pay &amp; only now am I beginning to settle down &amp; breathe, well not so very freely.  My dear it is a parlous place, what with bombs &amp; shells &amp; the row &amp; heat &amp; dust:  well life isn't at its most pleasant just now.  However c'est la guerre.  The same guerre is responsible for the fact of my not having had any letters from you or Australia at all for two whole months.  Some you have written I suppose I shall never get, its perfectly exasperating &amp; I feel like running out &amp; killing all the Germans in sight, a nasty uncomfortable sticky messy death too, I'd give them.  Well as I haven't any news of yours to comment on I'll go back a little.  Last day of our leave but one I</p>
