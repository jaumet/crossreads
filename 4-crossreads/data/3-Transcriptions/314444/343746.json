<p>"Cannonmerrie"<br/>Albert Road,<br/>Strathfield.<br/>24th November, 1917.</p>
<p>My Dear Mrs. Hill,</p>
<p>Ever since I heard of your great loss I have been wanting to write to you and yet have feared to do so, lest I make the wound sore by any touch. But you are a brave woman or you would not have had so brave a son. My last letter from my boy mentions your boy, so I will just transcribe his words:-</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hill's son, was killed, or rather died of wounds, about a week ago; he is buried in a cemetery by the Canadian Hospital at Krommenboon about two miles south of Popperinghe. He was one of the best, liked by all men in the Battalion, and is spoken of as the bravest".</p>
<p>My dear friend, you may be proud in your grief, for men judge each other with strict impartiality, and what they love and admire is worthy. I need not say how deeply  I sympathise with you, and I know God will comfort you as you have tried and have comforted others.</p>
<p>With kind remembrances to your daughter, and love to yourself, the Mother.</p>
<p>From another Mother,<br/>Marianne Rylands.</p>
