wanted me to go up and take charge but was too ill &  when I went for a walk I fainted after doing 500 yds.  The missionaries (God bless them) especially Dr & Mrs. Funk did all they could for me & at last I persuaded the officials to let me take the chance on the run thro to Baghdad, which they did.  Leaving Hamadan at 6 am we pushed on until dark & then camped out in the blue.  My temp went up once more & next day I was exhausted on reaching Kermansbah where I was in bed for 4 days, then another stretch to Pia Tak, then Karnekan and Ruz where I anchored for 3 days & had real bread & jam.  Then a night's run on the train to Baghdad where I spent three weeks then on to Amara by boat where I stayed 4 days, then Batoun Amarah where I stayed a fortnight.  Then by boat to Bombay.  God alone knows what privations, hardship & horrors we endured on this stunt.  Scott- Olsen got his M.C. Murphy a bar to his O.C.M. Nimmo a O.C.R. &  Casey a M.M. while Moore the cur got on to Baghdad as soon as possible after our arrival at Bijah & wrote his report in such a way as if he did the whole show and did not recommend one of those I told him to.
I am feeling much better now however
