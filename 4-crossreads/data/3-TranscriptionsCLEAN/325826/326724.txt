  
 4.  there may be chance to get them later on.  Pension York      I received quite an enthusiastic welcome back here and a little after arrival had a telegram from Rid at Tel-el-Keber just saying "Splendid.  Love;" it was to relieve my mind about the conditions there for I know how horrid some of the officers were to him at first in the Hospital & how keen some O.Cs are to show the Chaplains they are not wanted.  It seems to be all right though the telegram was quite a surprise. I sent the cable to you to-day that we made up in Wal's tent yesterday. Must close this now dear People.  Very much love to you all,      Your loving daughter Olive. P.S.  Please Father will you take a note of the fact that Wal paid me back &pound5 last week; I don't want it but he wanted to get rid of it evidently.  O.L.O.
