  
 But if the artillery get a bad time, how much worse the infantry get in any attack is easily imagined. 
 The artillery suffer when they have to man the guns, at the same time as the Germans are doing counter battery work:  then the gun and all its crew often get lost. 
 But the infantry are simply wonderful, and I take off my hat to them:  I have seen a lot of good divisions as we live  am  with their forward companies when doing forward observation:  fighting continues all over Europe at the same terrific pace, but will calm down soon owing to the weather. 
 I have not answered your letter really in this one, but will do so in my next:  we are amusing ourselves in rest with Divisional manoeuvres in the wet. 
 Goodbye for today - best luck to all at Toganmain. 
 Yours sincerely John Chute Ellis
