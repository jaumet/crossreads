<p>Wednesday Sept 18<br/>We hear the big stunt is about to commence. This camp is closing up &amp; every available man is going down to the valley for what we hope the final smash. Excitement is running high. I have enjoyed myself here. It has been so quiet &amp; such a change to be away from Horses for a while. Have heard we will all be rejoining our various units to morrow.<br/>We heard a heavy bombardment in the direction of Nablus during the early part of the evening.</p>
