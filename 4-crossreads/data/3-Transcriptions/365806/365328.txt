<p>Saturday</p>
<p>Dear Judge</p>
<p>I enclose Myle's letter to my cousin, which she forwarded (by Malwa).  I did not hear direct from him.</p>
<p>And this morning came a letter from him with this little "glimpse".</p>
<p>"Sept 30th</p>
<p>.. We had an interesting letter from Myles this morning telling us about the review by the King on the 27th, of between 40 &amp; 50 thousand Australian troops on Salisbury Plains.</p>
<p>Lieut Ferguson had change of B Company at the review <strike>by the King</strike> Myles heard a man say that if Lieut Ferguson was "half as good as his brother was, he would do" which is great praise from the ranks"</p>
