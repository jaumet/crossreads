through Westminster Abbey it is a lovely building rich with l  statues of all the famous men of olden times, from there we walked over London Bridge & doubled back to the Museum, it is a wonderful show wh we spent a couple of hour's in there, after that we had dinner, & then went to a picture show & saw the Williard -Moran fight, from there we pushed on up towards St Pauls for the great Memorial Service was being held there for Kitchener & the King & Queen were there we saw them as they drove through the streets they were in a carriage & were escorted by all sorts of flunkeys & soldiers the King was dressed in a kakhi suit.
