 breakfast and then went on deck.&nbsp; Church parades at 10.30.&nbsp; Sang the anthem at services of Church of England and other denominations.&nbsp; Had&quot;Xmas Dinner.&quot;&nbsp; Special Menu - Boiled Pork, green peas, yams; fruit, which was supplied by the officers, and sago pudding which looked like a gathering storm, but tasted o.k.&nbsp; Cigarettes were also handed round as a donation from the O.C. Gray.&nbsp; Gave three cheers to O.C. Troops and Captain Jermyn of the &quot;Marathon.&quot;&nbsp; Also our own officers.&nbsp; Formed many mental pictures of the folks at home, wondering what part of the world it was in which we were facing grimly the sinister intentions of Hun and Company.&nbsp; H.M.S. Swiftsure arrived this afternoon.&nbsp; She was saluted by our transport in the usual manner and custom according to tradition.&nbsp; The ship&#39;s ensign was dipped aft and all the men on deck stood to the salute, as the trumpeter on the Swiftsure blew the call.&nbsp; The ceremony was very impressive and once again drove home to our minds the beauty and severity of the tradition and discipline in the good old British Navy.&nbsp; H.M. King George&#39;s message of Xmas Greetings was read the troops this morning at Church Parade.&nbsp; Gave him three hearty cheers for his thoughts.&nbsp; Afternoon&nbsp; Lay on deck and had a sleep.&nbsp; Evening.&nbsp; Sang Comrades in Arms with Quartette at Sacred Concert which was held on deck.

 Boxing Day.&nbsp; Rose as usual early.&nbsp; Had Breakfast and went on parade at 9.30.&nbsp; At 10.30 anchor was weighed and with H.M.S. xxxxxx Kent in the vanguard our vessel and three other ships steamed out of Freetown harbor.&nbsp; At last we were to leave this Hell on earth for something cooler.&nbsp; Steamed into a calm and tranquil sea.&nbsp; Not one wet eye on the ship through leaving the place.&nbsp; Hammock parade in afternoon.&nbsp; Also lecture in First Aid by Sapper Fern.&nbsp; Very interesting.&nbsp; After tea had to get our hammocks out of the bin in the dark.&nbsp; Found the job inconvenient and annoying.&nbsp; Soldiers are not saints when it comes to where they have to get in for their cut of anything.&nbsp; I know that I was not and only thought of rescuing my own little bundle in the general scramble.&nbsp; Had game of Five Hundred with Herb Larsen, McNab and Tim Woods in Sergeants&#39; Mess.
