 We now gave our attention to our own wounded and after dinner started on "A".  This boy had over thirteen separate shell wounds, most of them very severe.  They involved the right thigh, buttock, leg, and foot, both bones were fractured 2 inches above the ankle and, in addition there was a large area blown out of his left groin, exposing the femoral vessels and spermatic cord.
