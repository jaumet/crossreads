<p>AUGUST&nbsp;&nbsp; MONDAY 28&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Raining &amp; fine all day again. Did a bit of fatigue work shovelling dirt from in front of huts before breakfast. Out signalling the rest of the day &amp; had a lamp parade at night. Warren Hogarth came over in evening&nbsp; I got a letter &amp; parcel from Linda, the letter in answer to mine from Durban. She was very glad to get it &amp; I think it cheered her up a lot I think</p>
