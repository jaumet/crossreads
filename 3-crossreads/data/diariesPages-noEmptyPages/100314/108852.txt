10/2/18 Velinghem
Rode out through Ledinghem with Sale down to Watterdal and the high ground on the other side of the village. The lanes were pretty and hedge bordered and the little village of Watterdal is an old fashioned irregular one with old neat thatched moss covered farmhouses. Passing through here we gained some high ground from which was an excellent view. A strong wind was blowing and women were coming along the roads many of the accompanied by Australian soldiers. A very fine panorama from here. Went over the ground for an operation order writing stunt for Division covering some miles and traversing a couple of small leafless woods. From here we rode through Colombra
