MAY   WEDNESDAY 10   1916
How fortunate is he who finds a new joy for each day
In doing well the things at which he works away;
 
To him the weeks are never long,
And even if his wage be small,
There is upon his lips a song
That slaves may never learn at all.
 
This world that we're living in
Is mighty hard to beat;
You get a thorn with ev'ry rose,
But ain't the roses sweet!.
 
Frank. L. Stanton.
