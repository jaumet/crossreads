<p>Thursday 15th Oct<br/>We accordingly went on guard at the 2 M.S. Store. No excitement during the day as usual Jackson went to the hospital with fever. At night time passed very enjoyably watch the Germans signalling to each other by way of a little sweet pastime at midnight</p>
<p>Friday 16th Oct.<br/>Marched out again early in the morning I &amp; two others pushed a cart ahead of us. The object of the trip was we ultimately found out, to cut down a tree for a wireless pole, as the one we have is useless. We located a beauty &amp; after putting ropes all over it and cutting it down it fell across a log &amp; broke in two. Another was found &amp; cut down. We spent all the afternoon dragging it into position &amp; then marched home.</p>
<p>Saturday 17th Oct<br/>On guard again. Poor old Wakley was carried to the hospital with an unknown complaint. Personally I think he has pneumonia as he is subject to it &amp; as Watson has also had it</p>
