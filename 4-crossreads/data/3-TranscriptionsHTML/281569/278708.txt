<p>27 July, 1916 Thursday</p>
<p>In touch at VMM VGBA</p>
<p>Left early this morning &amp; again missed the bivouac &amp; had to get traffic through 21A one of the outposts, moved off at 0300 &amp; passed through Katia at 0530, all clear but it wasn't long before we were in touch all along the line &amp; we eventually drove there line back at VMM VGBA one patrol under a Sgt got right into Oghratina &amp; were looking down the Hod before Jacks spotted them &amp; it took them all their time to get clear, other patrols did well also, we shelled them to some time again firing about 50 rounds at different targets &amp; works completely demolishing same. Left at 2108 for home arriving two hours later tired but happy after putting in an enjoyable day.</p>
<p>26 July, 1916 Friday</p>
<p>2nd Bde out this morning &amp; officers patrol reported considerable activity along the whole of the enemys line &amp; at dawn they commenced their advance on VMM-VGBM which they held at 0600. Their left had in the meantime swung round Sagia &amp; enveloped Hill 245 which they held all day, at 1400 the Wellington Mtd rifles made a demonstration against them at VMM-VGBA &amp; succeeded in driving them back for 1000 yds captured 16 prisoners &amp; on the whole did real well our casualties were 3 killed 3 wounded.</p>
<p>Jacks has made his former line of defence very strong &amp; will take some routing out probably his idea is to fall back on these positions should he get a push from there and Hostile planes engaged ours on two occasions, no losses.</p>
