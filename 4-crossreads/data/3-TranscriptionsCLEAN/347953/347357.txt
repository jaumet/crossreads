  
 Received letters from home & friends and was extremely pleased. 
 We heard some news here & were sorry to hear the fate of the warship "Formidable" in the English Channel but nevertheless things seem to be going on satisfactory. 
 We arrived in Aden in the 23rd Jan  in the morning & left in the evening nothing to see there except the Arabs who sold cigarettes & dates to us from their dingies. 
 We are now passing through the red sea & expect to reach Port Said by Monday.
