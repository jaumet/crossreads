Monday 20 May
Summer weather still continues is simply glorious. We were relieved this evening while we were coming out the Bosch gave us a hail of gas H.E. shells.
Now back at H.Q. near Hazebrouck.
Tuesday 21 May
Down here, at Hazebrouck we lead the simple life and get round all day in shorts playing cricket croquet. Bathing every morning after a mile run. Still glorious weather.
