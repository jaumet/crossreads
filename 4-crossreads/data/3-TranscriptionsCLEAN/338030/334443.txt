Left Hazebrouck at mid-day and got to Calais at 4 p.m., where we had a 6 mile walk to the remount camp. Left 7 a.m., Monday, and the horse I had happened to be a buckjumper. I managed to stick on but, later, during a bucking exhibition, lost my mule that I was leading. We caught the mule after travelling about 6 miles further along the road. We reached our camping ground at 3 p.m. and stopped the night. That night a couple of us walked to a village about 2 miles away
