<p>the other two did the work by punting us up the river &ndash; I was trying to compose poetry about the scenery &ndash; the occupied pretty house-boats we passed &ndash; the flowers that grow on slopes down to the waters edge &amp;c but as I was longing for the presence of Sister Pratt to inspire me &amp; she being quite out in (Australia) poetry vanished &amp; I just got a quiet mood &amp; thought of you all and how I wished you could see all the things that I am seeing &ndash; Sweet dreams.</p>
<p>Wednesday &amp; Thursday were tit bit days with nothing worth writing about .  Friday afternoon another picnic party to Epsom, Leatherhead &amp; Dorking quite as enjoyable as the previous ones, afternoon tea outside &amp;c.</p>
<p>Saturday notice "Going on Monday for Sure".  Again to make the most of the time I very much want to visit Manchester to see Mr &amp; Mrs Bulby &amp; Iris, but as it is 200 miles &amp; travelling would make up 10 hours I could not with comfort do it in one day, so ask permission for the night but am refused.  I shall be terribly disappointed to have to return to Australia without seeing them &ndash; so near &amp; yet so far.  Mr Bulby would have come to London had he known that I was still here but I failed to let him know until to-day &ndash; the truth was I didn't think it warranted the expense &amp; I was still hoping that an opportunity would present itself.  However Mon &ndash; being off I turned by thoughts to Leicester 99 &frac12; miles north, to see Mr Smarts' people whom he had kindly written to &amp; gave me a letter of introduction.  Before leaving the Mooltan at Plymouth I had a letter from Mr Smart welcoming me to their place so I went &amp; it was another happy home day.  Arrived at dinner time to enjoy more green peas &amp; new potatoes, also</p>
