  
  Wednesday 16 May 1917.     
 Still at sea and still no sight of land. Spent a better day & feeling almost right again.  
 Everyone still a little more brighter. Wrote 1 letter in afternoon and with ship rolling  heavily upsetting plates. knives forks from shelves. 
 Wind not so strong & sea not  quite  so rough. 
 We are now over  500 miles from  land  usual route  down in the "Roaring Forties" Very rough weather indeed. Are well out of sight of any shipping of any description along Sth coast of Australia 
 ['Warrego" destroyer left us yesterday Tues 15 th  inst.] 
 Only one escort with us now.
