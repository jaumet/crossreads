Nearly every farmhouse that I have seen since coming here has a little niche in the wall of the house. In this niche there is a figure of a favourite saint from which they hope to gain pardon for sins and help to live religious lives.

The people here go in greatly for symbols of religion. When one goes into the people houses the thing that strikes one most is the large number of crucifixes, Statuettes of Saints and Wax Flowers which decorate the home.

Sometimes one is inclined to think that these people attached more importance to these symbols than to actual deeds. Even in wearing apparel I have seen the larg children with numerous small metal statuettes hanging round the neck and while holding which ever saint they wish to pray to they mutter to themselves their prayers.

One usually saw these Statuettes standing on the dresser in the Kitchen with glass cases over them.
