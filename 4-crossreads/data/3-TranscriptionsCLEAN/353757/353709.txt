a bit paralysed sometimes &, in fact, won't ever be fit for much work.  I got buried & smothered & crushed & it comes on me sometimes also a slight hernia.  But I'm alright otherwise & hope to be into it again soon.
Yours sincerelyArthur
P.S.  I must try & get back even if its only to meet Mrs. Vol as I'm sure she'll be very nice, otherwise why should you, oh critical one, be so happy in your ideal?
