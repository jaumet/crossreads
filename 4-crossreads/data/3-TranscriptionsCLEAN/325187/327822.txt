[Friday 17 March 1916]
Went to Dinner again at another Pashas, & found the same round table had been carted per pack Donk from our recent Host.  Evidently only the only  one Table in District- Bedouins feed on the floor- & tear the food with hands At one village Collected a 16 bore Shot gun & 20 Cartridges, the latter we were informed were to shoot quail etc: but on opening found they were loaded with Siran drop, the very largest shot made.Cartridges were filled for man hunting I think.A bag of newspapers were lost in one of the Canals, Donk fell in- rotten luck, a man has a lot of luck to get his mail at this game & when it does arrive he appreciates it.
