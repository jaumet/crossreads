Monday 1st October
We travel along a lane like a T.S.R. & should arrive at TARANTO opposite BRINDISI at 5 p.m.
The destroyers who accompany us dodge about in front or on a flank like a good sheep dog working a single sheep. If anything suspicious is seen a cloud of smoke is put around us. Another 5 hours & we will have run the gauntlet successfully. My health has improved so much that my nerves are better than they have been for a long time. We saw one submarine quite plainly on our Starboard bow.
