28 December 1918 SaturdayGen Chauvel inspected us today & said he hoped we would commence being demobilised soon-   He avoided the BEDOUIN massacre- it was wonderful how well the men turned out considering their spree-The Band had no Band Master & let themselves go the tune was awful-Alls well, but I am hungering to get homeWith love to you allFrank
