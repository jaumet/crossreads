French &amp; my books get a turn when I am feeling fit which will be more often now that we are reaching cooler climes.  At night a concert was given but very ordinary.  A new artist tried our patience with a long monotonous recitation which few could hear, the termination being received with vociferous applause and calls for more, which earned well merited rebuke</p>
