<p>being a Bushman or a coalheaver or dropping a sufficient number of H's, my application is not considered. Return once more to the Signallers, but cannot make a  do of it.</p>
<p>Oct:<br/>'Tis rumoured the War will be over before we get there. Would to God I could think the same. The boys seemed very disappointed &ndash; if only they could see what the battlefield is like! To see all their comrades maimed and dying ! their disappointment would be turned to joy at the thought of the War terminating.</p>
<p>Oct:<br/>Flag wagging. Wonder if I shall ever be any good at it.</p>
<p>Oct:<br/>Train to Cottesloe for three days training at the ranges.</p>
<p>Oct:<br/>My first shot with the rifle &ndash; can't stand the damned noise. Hit the target, don't know how I manage it. I know I shall never be able to shoot at a man.</p>
<p>Oct:<br/>Finished at the ranges &ndash; have done much better than I expected. Break camp and go to Perth. Return to camp next morning but before entering take off tunic and puttees and hide them in a bush in order that they may think I have been in camp all night.<br/>I try to find tunic and puttees &ndash; cannot remember which bush I hid them in &ndash; eventually find them.</p>
<p>Oct:<br/>March back to Perth, 15 miles &ndash; camp in Drill Hall. Off to Dr Gordon for the evening. 1 a.m. return to Drill Hall,</p>
