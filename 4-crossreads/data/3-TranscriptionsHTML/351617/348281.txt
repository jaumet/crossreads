<p>camp I went for the first test in an effort to join them but found that out of 30 of us they only wanted 8 &amp; my turn was about 25th. They gave us all a riding test but it was only to fill in time &amp; long before my turn came the 8 were picked These included 4 Russian Sailors who gained preference before our own boys,</p>
<p>On arrival back in camp I made up my mind with a few more that we would volunteer the following day for the infantry &amp; 3 days later were drafted from Casula to Liverpool camp. Here I was put into the 5th Rein of the 30th Battalion &amp; a few days later into the 6th Reinfs of 30 which made no difference as we were both to sail on the same boat.</p>
<p>We stayed in Liverpool Training &amp; going through all the necessary Drilling until the afternoon of the 8th of April</p>
