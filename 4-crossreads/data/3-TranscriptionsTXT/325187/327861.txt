[Thursday 27 April 1916]
Court again   We work 8 1/2 hours daily in the heat in Court .Have just heard about the men rioting in Sydney & Liverpool if those are the sort of men who are coming over, We would be better without them, it needs a strong man & a good man to handle a crowd like that but what a start for a young soldier, it is almost unbelievable.The Copts here held a Bazaar for the British + [Red Cross] & made about 800/-/-.  I am keeping a little Water Color of a Sheik for you Mother.  Do you ever do any painting now, am so glad to hear you can walk so much better.Khamsin or Sirocco tonight all Dust .
