<p>At Sea<br/>5.8.19</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>The job is very nearly over. We are due at Melbourne tomorrow afternoon. How long we shall be there I do not know but we should leave at the latest on Thursday morning and should arrive in Sydney well within the 48 hours.</p>
<p>The trip has been a very good one but frightfully tedious and I am dying to have it finished and get home again.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
