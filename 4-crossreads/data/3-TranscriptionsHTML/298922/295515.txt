<p>Tuesday 24 July 1917</p>
<p>Turksare mounted on miserable Arab Stallions, but they carry an immense load &amp; are loaded to the teeth carting around LANCE &amp; Sword, Shoes, NAILS, Picketing Peg, NOSE BAG, BLANKET, MESS TIN, Ammunition, TUCKER, etc.:- Mostly LOUSY, but fat &amp; young lucky chaps. We drop propaganda literature in the Huts &amp; Outposts for their Patrols to pick up. Some of the saddlery was made in VICTORIA!!!, the bulk of equipment in Berlin. <strike>Neither you nor DAY ever mention domestic troubles. I suppose old Daisy is doing the work as of old &amp; not grousing &ndash; as I am inclined to but I'm getting Homesick.</strike></p>
