  
 to push a lot more in - we talked malaria & I picked up a good deal by judicious questions & asking advice & I am to turn up at his Sick parade on Monday & bring a client or so - Its clever scientific work - malarial - A man may have  several infections & be bit by mosquitoes with the infection at different times - This means that these parasites mature at different dates - all on same day or otherwise. You have to spot all this by the blood exam & then arrange your treatment so as to hinder the maturation of the spores - This means - the blood part - means - delicate work & accuracy could only be got by long work - It wd suit me - the science & the instant practical outcome of it - I saw my men - There isn't 1 bed in that Hosp - all on stretchers on the floor!!!  A damned rotten shame & so hard to nurse -
