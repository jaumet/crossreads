IIanother move. Am now in the 8th (West Australian) Battery which is one of Rosie's Brigade. As things are very unsettled still, I don't know whether I will be kept here, so it will be just as well to go on addressing letters as before. Of course any fresh move I will at once let you know. I hear that other Batteries are being formed so there are almost sure to be other changes before long. Very glad the photos reached you safely. I hope to be able to get some good ones here.It is a pity Sis is worried about those submarines as it will take a good deal of pleasure off the trip. Of course there is no denying the fact that anyone who takes a sea voyage just now is taking a certain amount of risk.I quite forgot to tell you in last letters, while walking round the Hospital at Lemnos on my way up here who should I meet but old Barnes. He is large as life, in the Medical Corps with Sergeants stripes up.Today I also met young Neill Pringle for the first time. He told me he has been here
