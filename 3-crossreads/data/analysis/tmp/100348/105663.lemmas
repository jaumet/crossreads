 my way out over two mile of shell torn , water soak , ground to our Reserv posit in Gap Trench , where I crawl into a shelter and slept . Another night in that infern outpost would have kill me ; as it is I am utter worn out . [ Transcrib by June Pettit and Patricia Ryan for the State Librari of New South Wale ]
