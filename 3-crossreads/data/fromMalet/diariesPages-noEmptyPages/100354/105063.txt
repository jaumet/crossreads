 We arrived at Delville Wood at dark for the first time for three days nights were able to change our wet sox boots be down.
We rested at Delville Wood until Monday 6th Nov when we again shifted up in the vicinity of the line relieving No 1 Gun on the following Wednesday. The trenches owing to the continual rains were worse in mud of athan on the previous occasion. German artillery was exceptionally busy on the night of the 8th early on the morning of the 9th as a prelude to a days heavy bombardment our light batteries set up a heavy barrage on the enemy line. The air seemed full of the rushing bustling shells which burst so rapidly over the enemy line that he found it difficult to keep flares alight!
We were relieved on the 9th struggled out to our bivouac at Bonife (?) Wood (Bernafay). Here I was removed to hospital in Rouen arriving at No 12 on the race course on the 12th.
Arrived back with the Battn on 30th Nov. Resting at Flesselles. Move to Ribemont Dec 7th. Weather extremely
