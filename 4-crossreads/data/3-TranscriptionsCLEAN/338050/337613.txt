At the cemetery we saw Captain Fryall Grave and afterwards inspected the cathedral. 27th March Caught the 7.00 am train to Ostend and caught the tram out to Zee Brugge where we saw the Mole. The S.S.Brussels (Capt.Fryall boat ) has been sunk in the mouth of the harbour by Fritz before he left. Then we went round to the mouth of the canal and saw the Iris and Dafodil. Then we returned to Ostend and saw the Vindictive after which we lunched and caught the train back to Brusselles.
