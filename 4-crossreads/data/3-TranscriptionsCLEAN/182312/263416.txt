 consists of the 5th, 6th, and 7th Brigades (i.e. Battalions from 
 17th to 28th inclusive), and had preceded us by a week but instead 
 of halting at a base had gone straight up to Billets at the front. 
 Our job is to keep the 2nd. Division reinforced and they have only 
 to telephone down for whatever men or officers they want and they 
 get them next morning.  Meantime we are continuing training within 
 sound of the guns.  Our training here is more practical than in 
 Egypt and consists in Bayonet work, trench work, machine guns and 
 bombing.  Every man is made thoroughly conversant with the type of 
 machine gun now in use and each of the officers must be capable of 
 acting as 'machine gun officer' should occasion warrant it.  Bombing 
 is very interesting work and is carried out entirely with live bombs. 
 One soon gets used to holding a fizzing bomb in one's hand knowing 
 that in three seconds it is going to tear a hole in the earth large 
 enough to bury an elephant.  A longer fuse than this gives the enemy 
 a chance to pick up the bomb and throw it clear.  You are casually 
 told by the instructor that owing to the unskilled labour now being 
 employed in making the bombs in England the fuses cannot be depended 
 upon, and they might go off any time.  They are supposed to be timed 
 for 5 seconds, and to make sure that the enemy has not time to throw 
 it back you ignite and retain it 2 seconds in your hand before throw-

 iately after lighting is irrepressible - particularly after you have 
 heard of the uncertain fuses - but you soon get used to it and I have 
 seen chaps hold them to their ears to hear if the fuse was burning. 
      The weather was beastly cold, wet and windy when we arrived and 
 we suffered rather severely from this combination, more particularly
