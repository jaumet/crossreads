 The Turks made another attempt to give us a little more trouble last night but didn't do much good only wasted a few shells but at daybreak they came for us properly with all their arty after an hours bombardment they took up the rifle &amp; fired continuously for an hour not a shot did we reply they were to cunning to come out though so beyond giving us a little entertainment they did no damage.  A full brigade of 5.2 howitzers landed last night 8 guns are to go on our left &amp; 8 on our right this brings the total guns up to 72.  Gen Hamilton paid us a visit in a racing motor launch today from Imbros  Night before last the troops down at the Cape advanced 2100 yds in one place &amp; in others took two sectional lines of trenches.  The Monitor has been firing continuously all day at the rear of Achi &amp; getting great bursts evidently the Turks are keeping their reserves there now as they are being continually faced back.  More Jack Johnsons on Steels at 1800

 Nothing of note during the night only several bursts of rifle fire accompanied by bombs &amp; grenades.  Capt Fiaschi has been attached to the 1st Regt as M.O.  During the morning Cecil Oliver called &amp; informed me that Eric Parki  was killed whilst attending his gun both his mates were wounded by the same shell so that's "finish" Parky's.  Went down for a swim which was just perfect &amp; came home under a perfect hail of lead  I don't know how I missed it both sides were at it tooth &amp; nail for 2 solid hours &amp; at the Cape the guns were continuously on the roar.  Another baty was landed last night the first one opened fire toady on the Chess board &amp; did effective shooting, finished the bomb proof shelter last night &amp; made a good job of it.  Turks towards evening threw dozens of bombs at our structures at Quinns but without effect they then made a false attack but nothing was doing so they fell in.  Aeroplanes have been over all day so Turks must be in force in places
