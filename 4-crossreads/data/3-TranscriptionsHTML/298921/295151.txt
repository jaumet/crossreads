<p>June, 1915<br/>Tuesday 29<br/>5th Reinforcements under Major Mills Marched in tonight fresh off the Boat &amp; full of wonder as we were at the strange sights of Cairo, we have the 6th &amp; 7th Reinforcements out on the road. Hence our turn may soon come now to move off.<br/>What do people think of the "Gas" business, we might be Rabbits &amp; a Carbon Fumigator used!
