<p>19 MONDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; warm but dull. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all day, &amp; I got my</p>
<p>lot all clean. We had our</p>
<p>blankets taken away &amp; cleaned</p>
<p>&amp; brought back. I got a</p>
<p>letter from Mother, and a</p>
<p>parcel with only one boot in</p>
<p>it. The other must have fallen</p>
<p>out &amp; got lost. They were</p>
<p>rottenly packed anyway.</p>
<p>got a parcel from Auntie</p>
<p>Florence.</p>
