 Wednesday 18th April 1917 Received socks from Aline, and letter from Com. Bank. John and I harnessed up four mules as we have to go near the firing line for a waggon load with bombs, and take them to the dump just behind Gun pits. Picked up wagon at Vaux and got the bombs through without any trouble. This waggon had gone up the night before but part of the body got mashed so drivers unloaded, and left wagons at the side of the road. Arr. back in camp at 4.30pm. Paid 40 francs
