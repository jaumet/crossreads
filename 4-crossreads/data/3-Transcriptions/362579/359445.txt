<p>groomsman, another officer   &amp;  I went to dinner   &amp;  then to "Topsy Turvy". We enjoyed ourselves but it is not much of a show.</p>
<p>Kelly stayed at the Hostel after we returned from wedding because her cousin was to come to see her, so she had dinner with him   &amp;  had a good yarn.</p>
<p>Next morn (Saturday) he called for Kelly   &amp;  me &ndash; took me to the Station in a taxi  &amp;  saw me comfortably seated, then he was to take Kelly to commonwealth Stores to store her boxes.</p>
<p>So I'm here feeling very well  &amp;  happy. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. Hope Belle's birthday will be a happy one. Trust to see you all before many months. Love to all my friends.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
