<p>I am of opinion that the masses in England, &quot;the workers&quot;, as Australians prefer to call them, have never had a fair chance to develop their political ideas &amp; to enforce their industrial principles. Recently, organised Labour launched a political scheme designed to create a solid &amp; enlarged party in the House of Commons, &amp; the farmers there of borrowed largely from&nbsp;<s>the</s>&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;<s>schemes of</s>&nbsp;Systems. At the time of writing a Bill to reform the Representation of the People is before the&nbsp;<s>House of Commons</s>&nbsp;Imperial Parliament. This, coupled with the fact that a General Election is not far distant, warrants the&nbsp;<s>anticipation</s>&nbsp;assumption that Labour will be adequately represented in the next Parliament. It is impossible for Public opinion</p>
