Monday 5 June 1916A dull morning, leading to a very changeable showery day, though in all but little rain fell. There was a high wind & no aeroplanes were visible during the day. As soon as breakfast was over got my gear packed up & reported out to the Bomb School, 1/2 mile or so out of Sailly. Left the gear there & then went back to the old billet for lunch, & there being nothing to do during the afternoon went round to Leo & with him walked out to Fleurbaix where Rid was stationed. On the way out passed numerous billets that had been shelled, there being plenty of shell-holes & other evidences of Hun attention all along the road. The people were working in their fields just as if no war was going on.Found Rid after abt. a 4 mile walk & in the same building, acting adjutant to the 2nd Brigade was Lt. Lindsey Cunningham. He remembered Leo & me at once : after a cup of tea Rid took us round to one or two of the gun-pits but there was no firing going on. It was, however, very interesting to see the 18 pounders & howitzers & to see the shell holes made all round one of the batteries in a vain attempt by the Germans to get our guns. Walked home & after tea reported out at the Bomb School to sleep.
