<p>a day's trip with these chaps  -  Not that there was very much chance of this being allowed but I wanted the experience &amp; should have gone like a shot if I'd been allowed  -  Lucky I waited  -  Out here &ndash; you know &ndash; with all the crowd no one thinks of danger or of the future  -  We heard yesterday that we are supposed to have done very well to get here &amp; that we ran a very big risk &ndash; hence the darking  -  Our men I told you made a torpedo tube &amp; one &amp; all meant to have launched or at any rate attempted to launch one &ndash; bang &ndash; at any ship that bailed us up  -  If we'd blown up the Protector by mistake I wonder what the Admiralty wd  -  have said!!!</p>
<p>Well, well  -  Moore I didn't see much of but poor Scarlett's end is tragic &ndash; that beautiful bright cynical boy &amp; poor Besant, thoughtful with a sweet smile &amp; a kind voice &amp; a lovely manner  -  Then there's the men &ndash; the Stokers  -  Dare devils  -  You <u>should see</u> a submarine &amp; yet for a few shillings &ndash; sometimes but one extra per week these chaps cheerfully &amp; willingly risk their lives &ndash; day by day &ndash; week in &amp; week out <u>&amp; think nothing of it</u></p>
