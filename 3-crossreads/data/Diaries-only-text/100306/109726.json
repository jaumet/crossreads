on if ordered. I ordered him on to his (?) death in a short note "You must go on!" The heavy fire continued and the next thing was a Corporal stumbling in with clothes ripped about and twitching face ? one of the survivors. Attack had failed in front owing to the wire and Cull (?) and Corne were both killed. There were 57 other casualties out of the 120 men who went over. They came staggering back wounded and bloody. Those who got in did some killing but deep mud held them up. Poor Cull had his leg nearly blown off and had to be left on the wire where he most likely died. I sent him to his death. No word of Bazeley at all but it seems he had attacked earlier on the other flank with similar results. Called down again to Batt.H.Q. being by this time nearly dead with fatigue, having a sprained knee and having gone 5 days 5 nights without sleep. Reached BattHQ and found orders for another attack to be led by myself at dawn to attempt to take the trench again
