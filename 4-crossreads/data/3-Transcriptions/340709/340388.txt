<p>matters at Eitape, an important centre 260 miles away. I am to be in charge of the expedition at sea, while he will direct matters on arrival at our destination.<br/>The "Lili" &amp; "Davapia" left yesterday morning at 7.30 for Potsdam Hafen where they are to await our arrival. The "Lili" has a load of coal for the "Rheno". We (the "Rheno" &amp; "Witu") left Madang at 6.30 this morning. As we passed through the heads we could see we were in for a lively time. The "Rheno" stood on her tail &amp; brought her bows down on the seas with a crash. But this was nothing to what followed when we altered course &amp; got them on the beam. She weltered along in agony while the water raced along the deck. Nearly all hands were sick, one poor chap lying helpless in the lee scuppers. We signalled to the "Witu", which was also cutting a dido, to follow us into port. So now we are drinking tea at Alexis.<br/>Thursday Dec 3rd onboard "Gabriel" at sea : Still another "capture". Since drinking tea on Monday things have been happening. We left Alexis at 5 am on Tuesday &amp; steered for Croissilles. The sea had gone down &amp; spirits had gone up, so everything went swimmingly. On the run up the coast we saw a most beautiful sight. Day had just broken &amp; the sun was making ready for his daily journey when a short distance to the eastward appeared a ball of silver floating through the air in a northerly direction. It remained in sight for nearly a minute then gradually faded from view. What it was I do not know.<br/>We had an excellent day's run &amp; reached Potsdam Hafen at about 5.15 pm. The first thing we sighted around the point was the "Gabriel" lying at anchor. The "Lili" &amp; "Davapia" were discovered closer in to the shore. The Major immediately boarded the "Gabriel" and we steamed to an anchorage. My P.O. from the "Lili" came alongside &amp; reported that the "Gabriel" had put in an appearance yesterday</p>
