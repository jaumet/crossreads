<p>finest call of the day.  The mens quarters are far better than I ever expected.  My platoon is quartered in A troop deck, that is the one furthest forward and I am lucky in that I have the troop deck to myself except that 25 signallers occupy one corner of it.  It is great to see the pride the men take in keeping their quarters well, and each mess orderly does his best to make his mess look better than all the others on the deck.  I don't know whether you have ever been on one of these boats but it may be interesting to describe <strike>out</strike> how the quarters are fixed up.  The men are divided up into messes of from 12 to 15;  each mess is under a corporal or lance corporal and tells off 2 mess orderlies who act for the week and each mess has a separate table which runs out from the ship's side towards the centre of the ship.  At the ends of the tables there are racks for the mess gear, plates mugs knives forks spoons &amp;c. &amp; each table has its soup jug tea can meat can and vegetable dish.  Rations are drawn from the galley for each mess by its mess orderlies and so each is self contained.  The only trouble with the issue of rations is the narrowness of the approaches to the galley and stores, which sometimes causes delay in the issue.  The Rations are excellent and plentiful.
