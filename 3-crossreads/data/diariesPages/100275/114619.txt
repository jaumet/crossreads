the hard metal roads wear our boots out like fun.
There was a great kick up here last night, for most of the boys got full as expected, played up top ropes.
The last 2 mornings here have been very foggy a very fine Scotch mist falling till 7 oclock after that a hot day.
The King is supposed to be in town today, Loutencourt is General Haigs Headquarters so it is a very important place, plenty of cars swell officers, to much saluting for my liking, you can't very well dodge it, though we do our best to do it.
