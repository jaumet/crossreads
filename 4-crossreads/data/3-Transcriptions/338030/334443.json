Left at 9 p.m. and got back at 2 a.m., after doing two trips.<br/>Saturday, Fritz came over and brought down three balloons one after another, also the observers out of three others. Whilst this excitement was going on the air was alive with parachutes, each with a man hanging to it. There were twelve in the air all at once.

Left at 5 a.m. and caught train at Steenwerck at 8 a.m. Changed at Hazebrouck, where we had a look over the town for a couple of hours, during which time we had breakfast at a shop. Left Hazebrouck at mid-day and got to Calais at 4 p.m., where we had a 6 mile walk to the remount camp. Left 7 a.m., Monday, and the horse I had happened to be a buckjumper. I managed to stick on but, later, during a bucking exhibition, lost my mule that I was leading. We caught the mule after travelling about 6 miles further along the road. We reached our camping ground at 3 p.m. and stopped the night. That night a couple of us walked to a village about 2 miles away</p>
