Lieut C H Read, who came over on the Ballarat for the Bridging Train. He was full of news &amp; just as witty as ever.  It was simply lovely to hear him rattling on again in the same old manner. We were Lectured by the C.O. Train on our future duties in France &amp; after it was over I went up to the Palace to see Uncle Charlie.  I sat talking to him for 1 hour &amp; then the both of us went over to Heliopolis House &amp; had Coffee on the Piazza.  He expects to leave for Marseilles by next Sunday week.  We are now very busy in transporting the Hospital contents to the Station.
