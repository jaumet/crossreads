a telegram to return Euston (London) next morning at 7 struck out for Waterloo Stn. Something to eat hit out for Portland again. Home about 7 that night. Next day all fixed up for going, inoculated, kit inspection, etc. Pictures concerts started again every night. Applied to go via America but seeing going in few days I withdrew .14th Dec. I've proved it since as I've just been passed off another boat beside 1st one I was on. Been shifted back to Weymouth again. Just before I left Verne I went to a dance there. Had a decent old time. Getting close on to Christmas no snow yet. Marvellous. Haven't written or received a letter for over 6 weeks now. Feeling pretty fit pictures or play every night.
