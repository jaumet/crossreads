 Re monument VIDE BIBLE it was here St Paul was wrecked, &amp; received no "small Kindness from the "Barbarians, &amp; Mother will know about the Viper that was brought to life after lighting a fire.  Malta  is a barren island &amp; all earth for agriculture is imported-  We anchored &amp; kept very quiet &amp; no lights,  as the last Troopship was fired at by Submarine in this anchorage. It is rumoured we now go to Salonika, but no one knows for Certain-  Our escort has gone to the town of   Malta   10 miles away so we may not leave today. At my mess table are 2 Welshmen 1 Scotchman &amp; an Englishman &amp; I amuse them with black fellow yarns &amp; we are a happy family &amp; worry not  but I cannot help thinking of the wee wife I left behind.
