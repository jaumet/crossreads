 18/8/16. Left Senlis this morning about 8-30 am for Canaples, our old haunt. We cycled all the way, called at Rubempre & had a couple of hours at our late billet there. Jeanne seemed very pleased to see us. 
 The wagon caught us up there & we had dinner & then pushed on for this place & arrived safely after experiencing my first puncture caused by a nail out of a Tommies boot. 
 We are not in the mairie this time but not far away from it.
