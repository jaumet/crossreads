<p>11 &ndash; I think now that all my old friends in the unit of 3 A.G.H. have gone that any cause of displeasure at me from the Matron has been removed my existence has become a matter of indifference to her. However should any trouble crop up, she can very easily get me transfered to transport duty. I like to stay in the old unit &ndash; though it is sad when one remembers all those who set out with it so full of desire to do their best and how so much friction ensued &ndash; a great deal due to that young cad de Crespigny who wants well smacking for all his brains. I couldn't say so much if this letter was going through the post. I must stop writing &ndash; and go to bed. I think you better burn this ilnatured letter. Col Jamieson will tell you a good deal I expect about the difficulties on the Island, But I'm thankful to say our hospital inspite of it's internal troubles did more good work than any other &ndash; and was I believe a home to all our weary worn men off the peninsular &ndash; I wish I was going home to you to</p>
