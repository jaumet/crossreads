<p>Come listen to me &amp; Ill</p>
<p>sing you a ditty</p>
<p>Of three little damsels</p>
<p>from London&#39;s fair City</p>
<p>To Codford they journeyed</p>
<p>air raids to escape</p>
<p>But rather I think</p>
<p>they came down on the make</p>
<p>___________ &quot; __________</p>
<p>Do they want us to lose</p>
<p>the war</p>
<p>Grim landladies sniffed</p>
<p>when apartments they sought</p>
<p>No thanks not for mine Ive</p>
<p>had enough of your sort</p>
<p>So sadly the girlies</p>
<p><s>bought</s> three tickets back <sup>bought</sup></p>
<p>Do they want us to lose</p>
<p>the war</p>
