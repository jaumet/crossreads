Tuesday 12 June 1917.
Sea rougher than ever and the roughest we have had yet during the voyage. Seas coming in over port the side as much as 5 feet over the outside above railing. Rafts torn away from their lashings & hurled into center of deck. One man washed on to a raft & had clavicle, & 2 ribs broken & a cut head also.
Sighted a liner this morning on port side on horizon. Sea calming down a little in afternoon. We have now passed Cape Gardafui [Cape Guardafui] & things should be a little calmer. Finished correspondence for this mail this afternoon. 2 boxing contests coming off. Extra large flying fish seen today.
