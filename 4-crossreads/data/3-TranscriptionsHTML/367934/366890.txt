<p>Talk about the adventures of Aristide Pujol.  [The Joyous Adventures of Aristide Pujol by William J. Locke.]<br/>He's engaged to a little French lady and writes her a feverish letter in English once a day.  This I rewrite in still more heated language and all her letters translate.  A glorious job but so exhausting that I feel I'm using up all <strike>the</strike> my latent mental love <strike>motive</strike> and literary psychic <strike>energy</strike> forces in his romantic cause and neglecting my one and only precious little Wife.</p>
<p>If there's ever a little person I speak of with pride that Person is you dear.  If there's ever a good boy friend who hasn't heard of <u>My wife</u> and seen her photograph playing the mandolin, I'd like to know who he is.</p>
<p>All the kisses and love in the world my Dear Precious one!  I just pray that you are well and happy.</p>
<p>Your Vasco, for ever and ever and ever xxxxx<br/>Love to Jack, Jen, the Children, Tom, Max, Hughie and the dear good Duffys.</p>
<p>Everybody turns up here in this camp.  Even Jack Sexton and Bill Chadwick a Cousin of the Winterbottoms and friend of the Duffy's.  I can promise you I have great times and lots of real French Leave.</p>
<p>Love to Mrs. Daly.  <strike>I never wrote to find</strike> I didn't write to any of them in France (Pas d'obligations).  I must finish with just one more hug xxxxx and an everlasting kiss of love that I hope will bring you all the luck and happiness in the world.  (Love to the dear Mandolin and once more to yourself, xxxx.</p>
