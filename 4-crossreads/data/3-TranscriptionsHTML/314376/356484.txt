<p>173<br/>order was given for our retirement to supports. We lost no time in getting back to find however as I said before, that our packs were blown up by a shell.</p>

We had only got into one when the word was passed along for men 25 of whom were wanted for a fatigue party to carry stew and tea up the line to feed the men who were there in our places. Of course we grumbled for we were vey tired and had been working hard all day trying to keep away from the bullets which the Germans fired at us.</p>
