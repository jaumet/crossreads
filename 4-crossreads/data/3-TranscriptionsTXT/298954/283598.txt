 The ward 2nd next door to us is occupied by a military lieutenant (Hun, of course.) 
 He gives us fags etc. &amp; we give him tea in exchange. 
 A decent sort, he sent home for all his old school-books on English which he gave me in order to practice up my German. 
 But he is addicted to Uniform.   Dinkum; I met him down near the Verbandzimmer the other morning wrapped in a gorgeous flame-coloured dressing-gown, and under The Garment he had on his uniform! 
 23rd Mch. Der Leutnant tells us amazing tales of a huge German offensive which began yesterday. 
 The Allies, so he says, are running like sheep and the war will be over in 3 months.   Of course we laughed at the news while Der Leut. was in the room, but things  do  look glum!
