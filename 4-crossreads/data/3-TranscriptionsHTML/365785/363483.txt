<p>Will's bedroom is just below the X.  All the officers bedrooms are there &amp; very hot they find them.  Some of them, Will included, sleep out on the parapet near that big chimney but flies &amp; light drive them in about 4 a.m.  The Nile flows beside them &amp; the island of Ghizerah where they are is connected by two fine bridges with Cairo.  And electric trams run to the gate.  Hope you have been having good weather &amp; that the garden has begun to recover.  The only fruits we get now are melons &amp; figs.<br/>Love from<br/>Rene</p>
