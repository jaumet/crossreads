<p>we lost poor Capt. Brown.  He was killed by a shell explosion at Motor Car Corner.  He was very highly respected &amp; his loss was very keenly felt by the Batt.  He was buried in Tancred Farm Cemetry.<br/>Some little excitement was caused by an attack on one of our baloons &amp; one of Fritz's planes appeared to be hit.  It came down very low but I believe reached his lines.<br/>I have reason to think I shall shortly be moved form the Bde.  It seems the Anglicans are going to put a man with this Bde. &amp; in the 35th Bn.</p>
<p>Sunday<br/>My service this morning was better &amp; again with the Engineers very good.  The weather has been very good &amp; the Lilac &amp; flowers are blooming beautifully.  Our men went into the Trenches tonight to the Supports.</p>
<p>Monday May 21st<br/>I went up to the 36th H.Q. in the line, had lunch and then went to see the boys in A Corp.</p>
