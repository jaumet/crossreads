July 1915
Thursday 22
Vaccinated this morning.
Granted home leave for four days.
No pay & no pennies so not much chance of getting to Grafton.
Wired return for 30/- & walked around with Francis.
He met his friends so I was left.
Saw Curry, Kenney, Miss Jepson & Mrs. Bruce
Went to Soldiers Club in evening & wrote a lot of letters.
No word from Rita yet.
