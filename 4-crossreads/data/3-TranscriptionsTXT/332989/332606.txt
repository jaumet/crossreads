My Darling MotherAm sending you a Cable tonight for Xmas, as I was unable to write six or 7 weeks ago having just been thro another operation to take some bone out of my shoulder, am getting on alright now, expect to go home about January sometime.   Have just had a present from Queen Mary a Hot Water bag, two came to each ward.  Mr Dixon says Russel Richardson sent a card 10th Sept asking for books & clothes which were sent, first parcel of food sent 27th Sept. and every week since.   Dixon told me he wrote Fred Richardson a long letter last week giving all the information he could.   Hope you are all having a real jolly Xmas & a happy New Year.   heard from Malcolm today he is still going strong.Fondest love to the girls & self from loving Son     George
