  
 original blacksmith shop & chestnut tree of "Longfellows" famous poem, "under the spreading chestnut tree & etc" when we got there, a parson was holding an open air meeting under the old tree, & there was a fair number sitting around on the roadside, while others were knocking leaves off the old tree for souvenirs, totally regardless of the service going on around them, from here we went to the ancient little church just opposite which the blacksmiths & family attended, & in the church yard he lies buried. From Fighledean we went to  Upo  Netheravon, but we could get very little to eat here so we turned back to Fighledean
