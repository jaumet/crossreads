Our course & movements are being kept strangely quiet, I have not heard anything from the signaller since we left Colombo.  The heat is now very muggy & we are exercising & hosing all day long.  The water is absolute red with rust, so we will have plenty of iron in our systems. 
 Friday, 20th November, 1914 The water man is complaining that the consumption of water is too great, far above what our allowance is to date.  He threatens us that the tanks will run dry before we reach Port Said.  Unfortunately we have not a condenser of any size on board. 
 Measles have broken out rather badly over five men now being in hospital.  Owing to the porridge for breakfast & lack of cooling medicine, nearly all of us are more or less covered in blood pimples.
