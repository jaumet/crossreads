July 1  Sunday
Delightful warm day. Jean & I had breakfast at 10.30. Met Dr Russell & Mrs Hunter as well as other workers from various parts. Then we attended service at the Abbey & went by U. to Hyde Pk - such a way to go. Jean went out to Watford while I returned to Hotel to rest & write letters. Nell came to see me & stayed late.
