  
 down like huge butterflies all the afternoon.  Only one failed to return.  We could see it with its nose buried in the earth & the Tail almost perpendicular up in the air.  The Ambulance hurried off but we don't know how the men fared. 
 Well, Mum, it is just on tea-time & I must go & have a snack.  We are to have a little card party in our Flat to-night just Dick, Tommy W., Ellis & I with supper to follow of course.  Kind Regards to all my Friends, to Otto, Amy & His 10 children. 
 Best Love to Dad, George & yourself, 
 Harry.
