<p>out &amp; too demoralised to show fight.</p>
<p><u>Nov 16th</u>:- Moved on again today to within about 5 miles of Jaffa. The country we are now in is some of the finest I have ever seen, orchards of oranges, figs, dates and almonds are everywhere to been seen. The oranges are now well in season &amp; we manage to do them justice. Only a few shells flying around today, Passed two or three more villages.</p>
<p><u>Nov 19th</u>:- Outpost duty tonight.</p>
