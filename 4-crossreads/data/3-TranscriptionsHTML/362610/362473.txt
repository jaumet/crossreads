<p>Thursday 14 Sept. 1916<br/>A bright morning but afterwards very cold &amp; changeable with several heavy showers. During the morning went to the Div. Gas School &amp; in the afternoon was fixing up a number of necessary gas matters. Cuthbert left for England on leave in the morning. Nice to hear the bugle calls again, more especially some of the cavalry calls.</p>
