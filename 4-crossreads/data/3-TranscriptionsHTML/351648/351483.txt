<p>but, they generally tell me more news than I hear in all others put together, and you are right too in your estimation of how much letters are appreciated, I get very gloomy indeed when mail comes &amp; I get nothing as has been the case very often though now I am hearing more regularly.</p>
<p>When not at an advanced D. Stn. I am running the Divisional Baths &amp; laundry, so that I shall have something to fall back on apr&egrave;s la guerre if all else fails (&amp;I now make application for your spare washing when I return).  Imagine me a laundryman to the manner born, of course its only a male department.  I daresay I shall be just as successful in female apparel, but there is no doubt the baths are a great institution, the men come from the trenches &amp; billets filthy &amp; what we call "chatty", they have a warm bath, get a clean change of underclothes, have their uniforms treated for vermin &amp; are dismissed clean, their dirty clothes are washed &amp; sterilized &amp; issued to the next lot that come along, its a fine system.  In the laundry are 80 French girls, you should hear me rousing in French <strike>because</strike> if the socks are not darned or the buttons not sewn on.  My French is really too atrocious but I make them understand what I mean somehow.</p>
<p>By the way I must tell you a joke, my trouble is this that I wrote to you a short while ago, and not sure if I am repeating myself, anyhow I think not &amp; will risk it, its worth it.  A few weeks</p>
