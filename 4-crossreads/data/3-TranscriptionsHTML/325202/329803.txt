<p>the 4th Div Train joined up with us one morning on our Daily Routine just to pick up the work. One of their smart new Corporals rode up to the waggon of one of our old 1st E.F. Drivers &amp; told him to fold his waggon cover neatly &ndash; The latter just looked down &amp; said "Get to [dash] H[dash]" "We are not a [dash] sideshow We are the 1st Division" Exit the officious corporal.</p>
