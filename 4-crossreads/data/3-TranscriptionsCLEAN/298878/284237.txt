 TO OUR CRITICS From an Australian Soldier in Egypt Aint yer got no blanky savvy, Have yer got no better use, Than to fling back home yer inky Products of your pens abuse. 
 Do yer think we've all gone dippy, Since we landed over here, Is a soldier less a soldier! Cause he socks a pint of beer. 
 Have yer got no loving mother! Waiting for yer over 'Ome, Do you own no smiling sister! Over there across the foam. 
 Do yer thinks they likes yer better, For your tales of drink and shame, Do yer think they'll praise yer action, In defamin our fair name. 
 One swallow makes no summer, Three schickers not a force, Where the few makes it a welter You condems, the lot o'course. 
 Do you think yer God Almighty, Cos yer wears a captain's Stars. Think us blokes is dirt beneath yer, Men of low degree & bars. 
 Say yer cannot be Australian, Let us say in our defence Yer can read it on your coinage Honny soit qui mal y pense. 
 Cease you wowseristic whining, Tell the truth & play the game, And we only ask fair dinkum! How we keep Australia's name. 
 We're not out to fight the Devil, On a new Salvarmy stunt, To reform the Arabs morals, While we're waiting for the front. 
 Let me ask you Mr Critic Try to face things with a smile Don't be finding all the crook-uns, Studying them Hokes all the while. 
 Then write home nice and Proper, "Bout the boys thats all true blue, And they'll love you better mister, This is my advice to you
