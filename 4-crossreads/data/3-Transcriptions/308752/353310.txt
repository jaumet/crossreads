<p>took place last February 1915. At 4.30 pm had the misfortune to strike guard duty. On piquet all through the night, bitterly cold at 2 a.m.</p>
<p>Saturday 18th December 1915<br/>Finished guard duty at 4.30 a.m. Half holiday. Spent the afternoon in writing letters, also had a good swim in the canal.</p>
<p>Sunday 19th December 1915.<br/>Church parade - quite a treat to hear some music.</p>
<p>Monday 20th December 1915 to Friday 24th inst. (Christmas Eve)<br/>Ordinary camp life.   Route marches &amp; stretcher drill, becoming terribly monotonous.</p>
<p>Saturday 25th December (Christmas Day)<br/>Great preparations for Xmas.   Camp decorated with flags, &amp; tables placed under some trees. So we are evidently going to have things in great style. The day started off well with a good breakfast, porridge, bacon &amp; eggs. The dinner was a great success, 7 courses including Plum puddings from <u>Australia</u>. A big bag of tucker arrived from Ishmalia for our tent including 4 <u>ducks</u>. We also had an excellent tea, preserved fruits, fish &amp; cakes etc. Eric missed all this, as he is on outpost duty with 12 others, about 10 miles out in the desert.</p>
