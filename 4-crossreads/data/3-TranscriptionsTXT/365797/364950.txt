Dene tells me he is now a "lance sergeant", pay 9 bob. For a time he had an attack of Laryngitis, & lost his speech, through the cold air at Liverpool getting into his throat, but he got right & generally he looks very well.
We have not heard from Olly on the voyage, & as no cable has come of his arrival at the Cape, we can only suppose it has been censored, or they did not call there, or they didnt go that way. However, some word is sure to come very soon, meanwhile Marion is being no end of good in helping to keep up Hazel's spirits.
I posted to you to-day a parcel from Hazel & one from Mother, chocolates fags, socks & so on; hope they arrive safe. Hazel spent last week end up at Glenbrook with the Magnuses, who I understand have not heard from Ran or Alec yet, except by cable. I hear from Cuthberts that both Niven & Noel are right at the front & Niven had a bit of bad luck, in that, while he was absent
