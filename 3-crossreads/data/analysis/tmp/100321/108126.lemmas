 5/1/19 Gourdinn Cold and dull . Bare black tree gaunt but the countri a vivid green never seen in Australia . This morn was erect a RAF hangar for our Cinema on Monday . Afternoon was squalli and the offic beat the sergeant in a footbal match . On rather a height the old villag cluster round it 400 year old church and look grey and expos . The Mair hous and farm are solid and luxuri of their kind and built on the most solid stone and all electr lit . After the footbal the sergeant offic again met in the even and play card in a bridg tournament . Thus did we spend our Sunday . Yvonn ( Chalmer Marrain ) is down for the day an unsophist maid .
