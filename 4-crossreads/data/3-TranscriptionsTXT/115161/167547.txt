 I waited my opportunity, and it came to. 
 I asked for a pass one evening. I went home stayed home the following day saw my private doctor the next day (I complained of a sore throat) obtained from him a certificate, stayed away from camp for ten days, had a good time, went back to camp, after meeting my O.C. one day and telling him I would be back the following day. He told me not to get there too early as there was a long route-march the following day. I duly reported at camp the following day and never had any pay stopped the next time. I was satisfied.

I noticed about a dozen &quot;jacks&quot; (our term for the military police), also a fair
