18-4-17We made ourselves comfortable close & West of the Wadi till 11 AM then crossed the Wadi & the Bde formed up two mile East of the Wadi just out of range of the enemy's guns; we waited here till 2PM in the meantime a Tauble came over us, we expected a bomb from her, but she tried to get in on one of our guns it landed in the gun team killing 4 men & several horses. We expected to attack this afternoon, but received orders to come back West of the Wadi again at 2 oclock ; With several sigs I then went for a bath & filled water bottles, as we go out at 11 oclock tonight, & attack tomorrow morning.
