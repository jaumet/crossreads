  
 [New letter written on YMCA paper] Oxford England 13-8-1918 
 Arrived here this morning, very weary with the travelling, and still am weary so won't write much, tomorrow I ought to be fresher. I am in a beautiful place, "The Examination Hall" it is called, I suppose of the University. 
 I must now send my change of address to the Army Post Office, as there are sure to be some Aussie letters along soon. Love to my little kids & you from Your husband.
