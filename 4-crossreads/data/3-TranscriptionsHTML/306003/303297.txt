<p>23.3.16<br/>Thurs 23rd<br/>This morning Reid &amp; I went out to the sand hill, but failed to get in touch with Beni Suef as a bend in the Nile with its high bank on the eastern side comes between us.  We came back to camp at dinner time &amp; found Major Smith had all the men fallen in early this morning &amp; told them he wanted the men to fall out who had anything to do with the canteen raid last night &amp; he would crime them later otherwise, the whole Sqd would have to do 2 hours extra parade both morning &amp; evening, &amp; as there was no response to the invitation to fall out; the Sqd put in this morning doing musketry drill; &amp; had a route march this afternoon, I put in the afternoon teaching the 6 new men signalling both, Bult &amp; Hargreaves are trying their hand at it.</p>
