thought of him; he told me to consider myself under arrest, then I jerked a cartridge into the funnel and ordered him to clear out. Reported it to the Orderly officer, and beat him again. Then some Anzacs who arrived from England this afternoon "counted him out". He is making himself unpopular.
31/5/16.

The boys are annoyed at the new company commander, and told him so. Don't know his name, we call him "Cuckoo". He is a typical text book officer. We greeted his remark that the "Book says"; with a broad smile.
