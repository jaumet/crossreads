<p>May 9<br/>Come over, come over the deepening river,<br/>Come over again the dark torrent of years.<br/>&hellip;<br/>Come back to the time when time brought no burden,<br/>And love was unconscious knowing not love.</p>
<p>The mornings far too full of sun to spend writing:  and today some time we leave here &ndash; handing over to either the French or the English, B. Sect. probably to Borre, A. back in reserve to H.Q.</p>
<p>124.<br/>A yarning at dinner of ways &amp; means of living "Apres la Guerre" without working.  Les favours a dependence on a gun, and a life of a primitive:  Norm suggests going to Burns Phillips and asking for an Island job, "But the bastards might expect you to work!" &ndash; and he changes his hopes.  Together with Buck, he's for running a Prophelactic [?] Depot &ndash; at the Railway, King St. and the Quay:  so followed loud talking of side lines, but the idea is good &ndash; good to be taken up by the Government.  Certainly it is one of the most plausible methods of combating V.D.</p>
<p>A bonser morning, spent walking up and down in the sun, by one of the paths in front of the A.D.S., scheming for the production in Sydney of a series of representative cheap books &ndash; of prose and poetry.  So far nothing in this line has yet been attempted.</p>
<p>May 9<br/>Tyrrel would be the man to interest, and perhaps Adams of the Bulletin.  Certainly an annual &ndash; after the "Melba Gift Book" style of the year's most representative clippings of prose and poetry &ndash; with half a dozen plates of The Society of Artists' most suitable exhibits would in a very short time come to take a high place in a collection of Australian Literature.</p>
<p>125.<br/>An afternoon spent basking like a lizard in the sun, half stripped on the wall by the orchard.</p>
<p>It is a long while since we have heard of any of America's war paint:  a promise was that by January a great school of planes would be ready, and for the spring her fighting men.  Today an Inf. chap of the 6th Batt. &ndash; a bar M.M. spoke of some French spoken opinions.  It is over a year since the Americans declared war &ndash; now they profess a readiness early in 1919.  Truly they are "hustlers".  Move off at 6.</p>
<p>Today the monestary of Mont des Cats shelled.</p>
<p>176.<br/>Lethaby's Architecture:  Forms are nothing in themselves, they are only envelopes of the spirit of Architecture.  The Greeks first freed the spirit of Beauty from the hieratic:  Architecture was purged of terror:  they aimed at what was gracious and lovely.</p>
