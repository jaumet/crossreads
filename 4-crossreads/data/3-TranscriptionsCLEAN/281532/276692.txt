Today the General was to have inspected the Battalion on parade but rain setting in early the thing was cancelled. Consequently the sky cleared and the morning turned out not half bad. Inspected the whole Transport section and found a fair turn out there. The remainder of the Battalion carried on with drill of various kinds. After lunch we held some Battalion Sports but the weather rather operated against us. Was summoned to Bde HQs to a conference and the G. told us the fiat had gone forth that one Battalion of this Brigade was to be disbanded. We decided the to leave the matter to him and abide by his decision. There will be some broken hearts in the 22nd Battalion if he touches it. We shall await the decision with impatience.
