 My dear Car, Joseph, &amp; Kitty:/ 
 When I was in Melbourne, a dentist whose name I do not know, looked at my teeth a couple of times.  Dr Kenny introduce me to him. I have written to Dr. Kenny asking that he should tell the dentist to send a memo of his account to you and that you would pay him by cheque. It will only be a small amount, which I should not have neglected to pay before leaving. 
 The two days out from Port Phillip have been as disagreeable as were those from Sydney to Melbourne.  Very few members of our party faced the dining table.  The senior officers, seven out of eight colonels, made a good showing and example by being at every meal I was not the absent one.  He was our clergyman, the Revd Mr Ney [Nye], an Anglican.

 Today the sea and wind have moderated to a marked degree, and the weather so continuing most of our party will be appearing on deck more numerously as the hours pass by.

 The copies of the pamphlets did not get to Melbourne before we set out, therefore I asked the man at Melbourne Club that they should be addressed Fremantle in the hope that we might be caught up at that port.  If we knew where we were to be found after that I might direct you as to letters, however follow the directions which will no doubt be published in the press, we can live in hopes that your communications will reach us in due course. 
 The group photograph, and the two small ones hang above my berth, these being ready to greet one each morning and to remind me of your smiles each time that I enter the cabin.  My colleague, Dr. Springthorpe, has been "cracking hardy" up till luncheon today, but at this meal he was almost himself.  Dr. Grey, the fat man, sits opposite to me while I write, struggling between reading the "Kings Regulations", and a pair of sleepy eyes, it is even betting which will conquer.  Dr. John Storey, son to David, has just come in.  He too is well conditioned.  The

He was critical of the management of the Red Cross in Egypt, and of Sir James Barrett's work there. 
 Major William Charles Grey, 39, medical practitioner of Lidcombe, NSW, and Captain John Colvin Storey, 27, surgeon of Sydney, also embarked from Sydney on 28 November 1914 on HMAT A55 Kyarra.
