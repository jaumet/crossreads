<p>2nd August (Wednesday)</p>
<p>Up at 10 a.m.  Walked right back to the Brewery at Fort Rompu with a sick man.  Germans shelling both sides of the road.  Ambulance packed up &ndash; "C" Section moved.  Lucky to have been back at the Brewery today for Fritz was shelling our supports heavily.  Our dug-out in the supports narrowly escaped.  Returned to Wye Farm from the Brewery in the ration car tonight.</p>
<p>3rd August (Thursday)</p>
<p>Roused out to take serious case at 5.20 a.m. &ndash; man shot through head.  Germans still shelling our supports.  3rd turn at the R.A.P.  An intense bombardment opened up by our guns.</p>
