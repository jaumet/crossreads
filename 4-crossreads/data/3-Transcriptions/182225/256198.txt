<p>FEB. &nbsp; SATURDAY 12 1916</p>
<p>Fine most of the day, but there was a few misty showers. Got away from camp early &amp; had breakfast at the Metropole. Met Linda &amp; Jo at the Stores&nbsp;at 11 oclock &amp; had morning tea with them. They came back to Lisheen to dinner &amp; I went up to T.K.S for afternoon &nbsp;It was Commemoration day there &amp; I saw a lot of old mates. It seems very funny to go up there &amp; see fellows that were at the prep in my time amongst the Old Boys now. Was back at Lisheen for tea. Linda &amp; I took Jo over to meet the Allison&#39;s after tea &amp; she went to &quot;So Long Letty&quot; with them</p>
