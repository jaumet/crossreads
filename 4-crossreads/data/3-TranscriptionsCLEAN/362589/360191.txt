Words, as I say, or even thoughts, do not really console but there are some memorial verses by Rdt Stevenson which Id like you to read -  In "Underwoods"  in memory of some lad of 17 - They begin with "Oh stricken hearts, remember oh remember - (look it up well worth} It full enlarges on the fact "that April came and smiled and never will drive December - and that we who remain are the true losers - And now there remains so far to us Robert - brave patient uncomplaining in his dugout - He certainly is worth renewed interest in the immediate future - The Bartons are trying hard to get him sent to England - to get a commission here, and go into an Officers training Camp -  Be  We don't care a damn about the commissions - he could get one out there if he tried - but we want to get a respite from our daily terror and lose him, and I think to many time to Stephanie - My family, who I have had little to do with for many years, are now pressing to have this done - I wonder if I ever told you that although we have been v. ordinary folks - clergymen, soldiers, and well to do farmers - we are an example of people with little or no landed estate [indecipherable] and yet we are an "old family" - we carried the standard at Flodden and have grubbed along to here 1513 - till now - and Robert is absolutely the end of the male Sherongs - my brother has 3 daughters only.
