machine gun mounted on the parapet. Our guns were pushing over a few rounds at various targets some of the shells were bursting well over our heads and sailing very low. Sitting under these when an error of the gun or shell would send the latter right on one, it makes one think it is a good job the little flappers who make these things have good supervision over them. We returned to our H.Q. without incident thereafter the night was quiet. Recd. word of Matthew's DSO Greene, Hutton, Madden, Patterson Abercrombie MC Cadwell DCM. Tonight I am sidestepping taking over more trench from 24th and giving more to 7th Bde. Otherwise a quiet night and nothing much doing. A little retaliation for our counter preparation.
