it was pitch dark everything in darkness.  people bumping up against one another all excited with the shells bursting in the air from the guns what was firing at the Zeppelin.  we managed to walk to woolich about two mile and there was a large Y.M.C.A. Building open all night it was crowded.  we got in there had a great feed meat vegetables it was alright for we was very tired and Hungry then we went to sleep there on the floor its a large building and crammed all night mostly munition workers.  we got roused up about 3 in the morning and then proceeded to the camp about four miles.  I had to take my boot off and walk bare footed for it was too tight and marching all day made it very sore.  anyway we arrived at the camp at five oclock in the morning and after a few hours rest was alright again and none the worse for the great day we had in London
