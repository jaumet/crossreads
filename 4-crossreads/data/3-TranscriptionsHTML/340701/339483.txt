<p>very thick with an inside panelling of Chalk Slabs.  looking through the grounds from the Chateau there is no wall visible.  Everywhere where there is an avenue in the trees the wall is removed &amp; its place taken by a small moat in some cases supplemented by a wire netting fence.  In this manner an uninterrupted view of the surrounding country is obtained &amp; very pretty country it is.  All sorts of birds live in the woods also Rabbits hares etc.  It was here that I heard a Cuckoo for the first time.</p>
<p>Thursday 10th -5<br/>We were supposed to go home today, but as no motor car arrived we could not do so.  We may have better luck to-morrow.  The children here at the Chateau speak English very well.  I have spoken to them several times.  I like the little girl very much.  The Marquise is ill with Diphtheria so is the eldest son, there remain one boy nearly 9 (John) &amp; a little girl about 7.  I seen a big shell hole today in the grounds.  I can never praise these woods enough.</p>
