<p>7/6/16.<br/>Reveille at 2 A.M. Marched out of camp, and entrained at Etaples. It was my first ride in the truck marked "Hommes 40. Chevoux 8". Travelled via Bolougne &amp; Calais. Did not travel very fast. "Bluey" McMasters fell out of the train and had time to run after it and catch up. Arrived at the railhead, about 3 P.M. Detrained and marched to where the Battalion is in reserve to the "Bailly" sector. Am billeted in a deserted farm house, not far from the firing lines, as I can see all the flares that illuminate "No Mans Land" at night. The Germans are using a curious rocket far behind their line. They look like strings of flares and they rise to a great height. The front seems quiet and is nothing like what I expected to see. A dispatch rider has arrived with orders for us to go and reinforce the 11th Battalion.</p>
