<p>the tail hanging out of his mouth, &amp; sucks away with evident enjoyment. From time to time he ejects the innards of the fish over the side, &amp; soon the boat is surrounded by fish about eight or nine inches long.</p>
<p>The fisherman is now in his element. With one hand he jerks them aboard, with the other he rips them off the hook while his mouth provides the bait. He would be a poor man indeed who could not catch twelve in a minute. There is generally a second man in the boat scooping them up with a hoop net. He is much quicker than the other fellow because he gets three or four at a time.</p>
<p>From this letter you can gather that I am in excellent health &amp; spirits &amp; that there is no need to worry about anything. If you are any thinner when we get back, I will be very annoyed. Remember me to everyone &amp; tell Catherine that the cooking on the boat is rotten.</p>
<p>Love from<br/>Your affectionate son</p>

<p>P.S. we have not been allowed to send any cables so far.</p>
