Heliopolis.
Tuesday 27th 1915. - The mail closes in the morning so am scribbling a few more lines.  Arrived here Sunday-night safely and had a pleasant journey, Dorothy, Sister Hart, & I were returning to duty.  When we got into the train at Sidi Gaiber, we saw Captain McLaren, so we had company to Cairo, he was just taking a flying visit to see his beloved.  A Transport Car was waiting for us, so you see we are properly cared for - no trouble about our luggage etc.
We had such a hearty welcome back from a number of our friends - so pleased to see me looking well & back into the Mess room once more - Also pleased to see Dorothy - We reached here just in time for 8 o'clock dinner.  Then were very glad to get to bed.  We did not have to report until 9 a.m.  Monday-morn - & then I was sent to the lightest ward in the building.  Had very little to do all the morning & dear Major McLean came up to see
[Sidi Gabier - possibly means Sidi Gaber]
