Heavy mist crowns the top of the Pyramids. Resembles the mist on the mountain tops at home.

Lecture from Capt Reach. He gave us some news which pleased us all very much. He said that there probably be no nurses going with us. Our probable distination will be the Dardanelles. Instead of 500 beds we are to have 4,000 beds in the hospital and every man in it is to do the nursing.

If Greece had fallen in with the Allies we would probable have been settled in the North of Greece.
