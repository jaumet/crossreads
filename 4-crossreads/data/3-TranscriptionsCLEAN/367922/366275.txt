  
 14. dear gatherings at old Denegully. 
 Just before I came away Mum & I were looking at a snapshot taken on the verandah where we boys used to sleep; it is of Dene, Alan & myself in our pyjams; such a happy little trio. The two Dear lads were brothers to me when I lost my own & as brothers I still mourn their loss & yours. In all my marching & travelling about France I'm always trying to get to "Worly" where Alan lies & where Dene went to see his grave & whose description of the spot & sad letter I can remember so clearly. 
 Though glad the little parcel of Dene's effects reached you I know too well the bitterness of such 
 15. moments & hate to think of all the grief you dear ones have suffered. 
 When I was in the line some time ago the postal orderly sent me up a parcel & when I opened it found that it contained all the little presents I sent Mum from London with such high hope of them helping her to be brave. Even a long 12 page letter I'd written & enclosing snapshots of Roy Kinghorn, Bretnall & myself taken at Parkhouse. 
 When the executor's closed our little flat they must have forgotten to arrange the receipt of my letters & parcels sent to Mother & all these things were returned to me through the dreadful dead letter
