<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Parade called by Lt. Col. &quot;Pompey&quot; Elliott on square.&nbsp; Marched to Parade Ground and went through several movements of company manoeuvres for him and, proving satisfatory, were sent to trench paddock for our trouble.&nbsp; Had lecture on wire entanglements and put in about 2&frac12; hours at the confounded stuff.&nbsp; Snowing all the time.&nbsp; Very cold and slow work.&nbsp; After dinner, did some bag revetting in trenches and found the shelter of the trenches from the cold biting wind, very welcome.&nbsp; Watched ice skating on lagoon during dinner hour.&nbsp; Work inspected in afternoon by Colonel.&nbsp; Left 3.30 for town and got home, only too glad to get under cover from the excessive cold.&nbsp; Went for mail.&nbsp; None as usual.&nbsp; After tea spent evening in billet writing up lectures and diary.&nbsp; Several rumors current re leaving for France shortly.&nbsp; How true are they?</td>
