the Town & made a few private purchases & then went aboard.
Could not go out at night as I had to stay on board & pay accounts, which amounted to over 400.
Feby 23rd (Tuesday)Sailed 11 a.m. for AdenGood weather.  Not too warm.
Feby 24th (Wednesday)Started active Service today & some excitement was caused.  Whilst I was having lunch at 1.30 p.m. I heard a burring sound above my head on deck & reckoned we had sure been struck by a Torpedo.  On rushing up on top I found the Chief Officer with his head down bleeding copiously & Lieut Walker with his trouser leg pulled up & bleeding from the shin.  After the excitement of 1st aid had finished I ascertained that Lieut Kelly was showing the Chief Officer an automatic revolver that he didn't know was loaded & he pulled the safety catch back & it went off, firing almost instantaneously eight bullets.  One passed right through the Chief Officers neck at the back just missing the jugular vein & the spine by a fraction.  Another passed through Lieut Walkers Leg just missing the bone.  Others embedded themselves in the deck & the Doctor had a very narrow escape, as he was sitting next to the Chief Officer on the same box & & 2 holes were found in the deck just above his head.  The Veterinary Surgeon was sitting next to Lieut Walker & he just missed one.
