  
 Saturday July 27 Grapes & Melons are plentiful just at present. The fruit is very welcome after our long spell in the Jordan valley. Sunday July 28 Rode to Jaffa today. Jaffa much altered since I was last there. The town has developed & business is in full swing. We had a dip in the surf also giving our horses a swim. Monday July 29 Took a trip to Richon to day. One of the prettiest little villages I have seen. The Jews seem well contented & prosperous.
