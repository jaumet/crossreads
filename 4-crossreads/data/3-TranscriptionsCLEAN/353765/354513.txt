  
 June 1915 1st - Very quiet morning. Our artillery did little firing. Turks did not reply evidently conserving their ammunition. Gave our valley a short but thick dose of shrapnel in afternoon. Went with party for rations. Reported that British & French had taken part of big hill (Eski Kene ??) & suffered heavy losses. Nothing during night occurs in trenches. Three of 7th L.H. smothered during nights. Dug out fell in on them. 2nd - Not found till morning. Buried at 9am. Troop marched (with arms reversed) to cemetery. Issued with trousers (Khaki slacks) today. Went for a swim in morning Rocky bottom. Took in our first hospital patients one (influx) kept in, other two sent to clearing hospital. Pat again troubled with donkeys walking on his dug-out. Wrote Cliff Stockwell. Reported that British aeroplanes damaged wharves & killed troops in Constantinople. [Note in margin:] Wednesday 2nd - Dug Howell from 9th inf, here in pm. Indians brought some japatti (or Gypatti) round. Dug Howell confirmed George Walker's report of 50 of 9th who volunteered & took Turkish trenches. Turks run at sight of them. Got six others got too great a start. Shrapnel very near, one burst right on us, marvellous that on one hurt, another burst close & shrapnel rained down on panniers. We all ducked in time. Enemies signals (patrol) understood. Where light means, patrols have reached destination. Two red lights mean, patrols returning in haste & enemy charging.
