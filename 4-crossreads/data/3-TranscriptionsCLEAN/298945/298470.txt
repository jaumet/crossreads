  
 Saturday 21 Sept 1918 
 Last night there was a full moon making the landscape show up as clearly as in daylight. I was able to read a letter received from Hicks (the American artist), with ease, outside our dug-out. The natural result was that Fritz came over in relays, & bombed our valley, & all round our ridge no less than three times. Nevertheless he did not have things his own way. We heard one plane steadily coming towards us, but before he had time to open up we heard a cheer from numerous "diggers" on the hills around, & rushing to the entrance of our home, saw the plane coming down in flames. Before  he  it reached the ground we head his bombs go off, evidently dropped in the crashing fall.
