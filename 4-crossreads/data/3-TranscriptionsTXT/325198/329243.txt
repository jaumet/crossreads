 14 February, 1916 Maadi This morning we did troop drill, I think it is to get us ready for a competition they are going to have to find the best troop in the Brigade. Some how I don't think A of B of the 6th has much chance &ndash; We were on putting horse lines down this afternoon &ndash; It does not look much like going away when they are arranging these competitions &amp; going in for this training. I wonder where we will all end up. Harold shouted Joe Woods, Jackson (the butcher who sports us a little bakseech meat some times) &amp; myself to the pictures to night &amp; after-wards we went up to the Soldiers Caf&eacute; &amp; had some thing to eat.  I am eating like a horse lately. Poor old Johno was wild this evening. We had come in from evening stables &amp; Johno had received a letter which he started to read before going to tea, when in came a chap who wanted to a tooth pulled, Johno put the letter away gave a growl about it &amp; got to work &amp; when he had it out the chappie introduced his cobber who also wanted one out, Johno went crook but pulled the tooth for him. Sergeant Shannon &amp; Crouch came back to day, they have had a good long spell in England. Stanton is still there &amp; I hope he stays as I have got his mare.
