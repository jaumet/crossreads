<p>shell about 5 ft long: also got a "P" of Sausage G. there are plenty of unexploded shells laying every where &amp; as for shell cases &amp; shell holes it is hard work to go a few yards without striking one: Fritz has had a hard try to get his balloons up lately but our planes soon make him pull them down: a few taubes have also come over but soon get chased up: the Froggies always have a dozen balloons up at least down their way: at 9 pm our guns opened up for 15 minutes &amp; then lifted as a barage &amp; our division charged: they got the first line easily but had to go a bit for the second we went up about 11 pm as a working party</p>
<p>Saturday Aug 5th <br/>trenches: our party got into a trench but Fritz put a barage over &amp; we had to double back a bit: we picked up one of our wounded &amp; run him down &amp; then started carrying from the front lines: It was hellish carry through newly dug narrow saps &amp; across open country through the shells &amp; we had miraculous escapes: our second line (German first line before the attack) had a good few wounded in it &amp; was filled with dead Fritz's some pretty "smelly" so our artillery fire lately must have played up with them: There were plenty of large dugouts &amp; "funk holes": out boys found a lot of germans still in them as they were not expecting an attack after so short a bombardment &amp; a few  "mills" bombs down each one played havoc: a few days ago I met B Yates &amp; have also bumped</p>
