<p>avail ourselves of the opportunity &amp; go to Ireland (Dublin &amp; Killarney) Needless the excitement of this anticipation (on my part) is greater than I can describe. My father's talk of the Old Country, also my Grand-mother's had set a great imagination in my mind, but the chance to visit there seemed far away. The interval of waiting seems too long. The remainder of the morning is taken up in securing railway warrant's etc &amp; receiving pay. (I draw &pound;4-5-0 <strike>)</strike> &amp; 16/- allowance). We part to meet at Euston Station at 8 am the morrow. After lunch I visit the Tower of London. Really most interesting. Sir Walter Raleigh's Prison, the Chamber of the baby Princes, Ancient Armour of every age, the spot of Mary Queen of Scot's, beheadal, ancient moats &amp; lastly the whole marvellous set of all the Crown Jewels, the whole fits in so well with history that I am lost in wonder. The Tower Bridge is fine  Go to the Vaudeville Theatre in Strand</p>
