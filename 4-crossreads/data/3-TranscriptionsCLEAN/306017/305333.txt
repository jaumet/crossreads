  
 April 1916 Yeomanry had had a rough time.  They were only about 100 strong & were suddenly attacked by 800 Turks with guns.  Most of their horses were killed & several camels.  The ground was littered with dead men horses & camels & during the morning we buried about 45 men 6 of these being Turks & 2 camel drivers the rest being English.  Worcesters & Gloucesters.  Most of the dead were stripped of their clothes & the stench was horrible.  The burial party was taken from my troop & they had to wear respirators.  The Turks had buried some their own dead themselves.  It was a wonder they didn't  follow up their success as the main camp was deserted by the others when they heard the Turks were advancing.   Lord Pascoe & many others were taken prisoners  Judging by the number of empty bottles he & his officers had evidently been living well, they even had a travelling bed-stead.  At the main camp there was a fair bit of furniture  Some of the Tommies came back
