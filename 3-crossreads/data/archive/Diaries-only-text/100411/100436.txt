crown of H.M. A courtyard too the very same as the old castles we've read about. From there we journeyed to St. Paul's. Absolutely the dome the best work of art I've ever seen. Most beautiful you could gaze about you all day. Went down into crypt where some our greatest men have been buried, Wellington, etc. After dinner we passed War Office and then went through W. Abbey another beautiful work of art a big place too. More monuments. Saw the place where the King is coranated where he sits everything else, Big Ben. From there we went through Hyde Park saw where Queen Alexandra the King lives (Buckinham Palace). A lot of snow a bit heavy for horses so we got out were snow-balling each other young tarts too ? good sport. Theatre that night. Bed about 12. Getting mumps.
