<p>that we are in reserve, &amp; too far back to go in quickly if required.</p>
<p>Friday 6th Sept. 1918</p>
<p>In the three days since I last wrote in this diary, I have been busily engaged in holding elementary &amp; advanced English classes, &amp; two committee meetings; writing letters &amp; practising shorthand (halfway through the Reporting Stage); &amp; arranging the many details of organisation for the holding of classes, particularly in arranging a new system of French classes. There is a slight falling off in the <strike>interest</strike> number of the elementary English class, but the advanced class consisting of my original English class is still keen. I think I shall be able to retain about 8 or 10 keen chaps in the elementary class.</p>
