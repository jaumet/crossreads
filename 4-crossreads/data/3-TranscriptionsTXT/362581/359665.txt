 My darling Eddy, 
 Your birthday, Xmas   &amp;  New Year's have passed.  I hope you had a very happy time   &amp;  lots of presents. You will be enjoying warm weather   &amp;  we are having&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a  very cold time now. It was very pretty at Xmas, the white frozen snow   &amp;  a little sunshine, now it is dull   &amp;  raining. Hope to sail in a few weeks. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. From Auntie Eadle.  OXOXOXOXO
