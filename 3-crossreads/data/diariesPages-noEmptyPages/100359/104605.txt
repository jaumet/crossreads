Saturday 16th
Got another letter from France this morning, which makes seven I received this mail. Tray Bon. had fried chops for dinner which was a great treat. Wrote to Mother and Nell and sent P.C's to France and Arthur. Went to Pictures. They start at 7 and finished at 8. And it was quite the most appresive hour I have spent since being in France. Mac and Wrighty came with me. The price of admission was 2d. Mac and Stan got seats together. I sat in the row behind between a fat "madame" and a cheeky young "garson" who immediately put in the nips for "Cigarettes Monsieur" Only 3 pictures were screened and all of a most bloodthirsty Nature. The music was supplied by an old worn out gramophone. It shrieked and groaned most dismally. Just as the beautiful young damsel rescued the wall-eyed hero from being blown from the mouth of an ancient cannon, the gramophone struck up "God Bless the Prince of Wales." It was difficult to see the pictures through the thick haze of tobacco smoke and when the door opened to let us out into the fresh air it was a great relief. 
Sunday 17th
Glorious sunshiny day. Taube flew over and got a lively reception from our A.A. Guns. Finished my weekly epistle to M.S. and posted letters to Mother and Nell and P.C. to France and Arthur. After dinner Wrighty and I went for a stroll along the Banks of the Canal. At night we adjourned to an estaminet near the Cemetery, where a lady friend of Wrighty's exhibited her very fine collection of badges and told us some of her experiences among the Huns which was most interesting to listen to. Then I went to the Butchers fixed up his cut fingers.

The owner of the Baths came buzzing round this morning and found fault with every thing. Trenchy was using some new betting and he nearly went mad, threw his arms up in the air and swore volubly, in his native tongue. A party of our chaps were in the Engine Room trying to get the big engine to go,
