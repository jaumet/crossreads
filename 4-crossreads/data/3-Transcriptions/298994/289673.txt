<p>About 5. o'clock this afternoon we noticed 4 specks of smoke on the horizon, that gave the transports and our warships a clue to their whereabouts.<br/> A heavy fog was present with us In a minute or two, 3 destroyers and 2 patrol boats were alongside us. They remained with us, till we came right into Plymouth Sound. Mine sweepers were in front of us doing their little bit! The day was very overcast, the guns in France were very audible</p>
<p>Well we had performed a long journey and so far Fritz had not claimed one of us as yet! In a few minutes we were within the Sound; as is usual in entering a port, our progress was slow! Fine commanding cliffs overlook the Sound.</p>
<p>The health officer was soon aboard, and at six o'clock on the evening of Dec 28th 1916 we stepped off the Port Melbourne, after a nine week's sojourn.</p>
<p>Special trains were awaiting to convey us to our respective training areas on Salisbury Plains.</p>
