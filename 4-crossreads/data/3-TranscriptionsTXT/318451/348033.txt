 Thursday Left camp again at 9 oclock, marched into the Station &amp; entrained.  It is now 2 oclock &amp; we leave at 3 for 36 hr. journey.  The men are in Cattle trucks each holding about 30 men.  This is the first time they have had the experience of Cattle trucks &amp; the comments are amusing. Spent all day on the Train &amp; all night, travelling very slowly. 
 Friday, 24 Still in the train.  The country is not much good and the houses poor.  We are travelling up the coast.  Passed through Abbeyville, Boulonge &amp; the suburbs of Calais.  Arrived at Balieul at 10 p.m.  The Trenches are not far away.  The flare lights &amp; star shells light up the sky &amp; the Guns can be heard quite distinctly. The Batt. set out to walk 6 miles to Billets.  The Guides lost them &amp; it was 5 oclock before the men got to Billets.  The sacks were very heavy and they were quite exhausted.
