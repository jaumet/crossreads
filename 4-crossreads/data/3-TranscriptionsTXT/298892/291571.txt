 I have no more news at present so will close. With Love from Eugene. 
 I did not receive the book mentioned in Mother's letter of the 28th May but am grateful to you for sending it. I am afraid it is not worth you while posting me anything as they do not seem to reach here. If you are particular about the address your letters should come through alright. 
 Address:- No. 1515 Pte. Eugene Sullivan, A.M.C. Detail, 33rd. Battaliion, 9th Brigade, A.I.F. On Active Service.
