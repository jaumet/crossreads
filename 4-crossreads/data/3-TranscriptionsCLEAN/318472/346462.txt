 A beautiful fine day with a very cool breeze blowing. Good War news. British advancing capturing Albert & gathering in 14,000 prisoners. About 10.30 A.M. one of the Mental cases ran amok & climbed to the cross-head on the mast a height of about 50' A couple of men went up after him & after a short struggle he fell striking on of the winches & was killed instantly. Buried in the afternoon! 
 1918 August 26 Monday Nothing unusual to note. Good War news continues to come through. Capt. Hunter late of Mawsons Arctic Expedition gave a Lecture with Lantern illustrations Interesting. Making good progress with fine weather.
