 Oct 2 nd  
    We are told we are to spell here for a few days & rejoice for we are weary & worn & dirty & hungry & the smell of decomposed Turk is ever in our nostrils.  A little way up the road there is a dead Turk.  He is lying with his head on his arm as if asleep.  I discover a [tibben ?] dump & the old mare gets a good feed & not before it is  wanted   needed .  I am ashamed to look her in the eye some times when I can only give her two handsful of grain.  She seems to say "so this all you give me after all the way I have carried you".  About 11 am the order comes.  "be ready to move off at 3 pm.  Dear oh dear. are we never to have a resst.  On again along the dusty road.
