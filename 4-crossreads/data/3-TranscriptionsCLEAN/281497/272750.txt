  
 quite black with the grit & etc.   We went for a stroll round the beach this morning & picked up a couple of dogs we then struck out across the heath & went hunting for rabbits the dogs put a few up & we had a bit of fun, we then went down to the beach & the tide was just coming in, & it travels across the open sand very fast, we watched it come in breaker after breaker, we then stripped off & had a fine bit of fun in the surf with a big piece of pine that we found lying on the beach we used it to shoot the breakers
