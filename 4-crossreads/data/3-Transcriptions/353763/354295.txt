<p>growing in shady spots &amp; on walls  -  In a swamp I gathered a fern (Blechnum) which I  last gathered a Tweed Heads may years ago  -  Taro patches &ndash; Banana plantations &ndash; all kept in the untidiest fashion met our eyes on all sides  -  Tree ferns (Todea &amp; Alsophila I fancy) do well here as well as multitudes of smaller forms  -  On return to town we had aft tea at a small place cleanly kept in Victoria Parade &amp; then went inboard  -  I had to examine a Sailor who had got 28 days hard labor for getting drunk &amp; then throwing all his mess traps down the hold &amp; being very abusive to his superior officer  -  I slept well on Sat night after  my long walk  -  It's the first day of Nov  -  A court of inquiry is to be held on the Flagship tomorrow  -  It's about the Upolu  -  She isn't sea worthy  -  An engineer lieutenant was about yesty finding out all about her engines  -  What the upshot will be we cant say but we don't expect to return to Sydney  -</p>
