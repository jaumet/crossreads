Monte Video Camp Weymouth. 7.9.16.
My Dear Mother
Just a few lines this time to let you know that I am now in a different part of England, We came down here last monday, worse luck. it is a cross between a convalescent, and a training camp. so a man hardly knows just what he is. at present I am having my arm massaged. it will be allright again before long and then the authorities can please themselves and send me back to the Batt. There are too many coldfoots here for my liking some of them have been here 12 months. I dont think I could put that length of time in, in a place like this. I expect to be sent off on furlough next week. I was to have gone this morning but did not wish to go yet, as I am waiting for a couple of the boys who came here with me, and I waited to give Mrs. H. fair notice. I suppose I will go to one of the training camps here for awhile and learn to drill by numbers again
