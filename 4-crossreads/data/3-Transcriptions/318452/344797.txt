<p>Friday Nov 30th<br/>There has been little of interest during the last few days. In a quiet little village beyond an occasional visit to the different billets there is little else. The weather has been fairly good Slight showers fall almost daily but it is not cold.<br/>I Walked into Etaples yesterday and back. I went to see one of our men in hospital but he had left that morning There is a large reinforcement Camp near Etaples.<br/>Received a letter from home dated October 9th yesterday also parcel from E C DeGaris for distribution to the men</p>
