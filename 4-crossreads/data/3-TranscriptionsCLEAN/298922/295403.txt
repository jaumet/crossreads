  
 Sunday 18 March 1917 
 The Minister of Defence cabled for Lieut. Menzies to go to Australia for 6 weeks. I don't know how it is done, but if you see Old Sam Mc.C. you could tell him. I have been a long time over here now if a job could be found even in Australia for a bit, wouldn't it be glorious to see you all again. 
 Mrs. Handbury Davies is taking this letter to post in Australia.
