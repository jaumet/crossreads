<p>Thick Mess-dresses with crepe-de-chin capes, white caps and shoes for a change. Fancy dressing in style at a C.C.C. but on   <u>such an occasion</u>, one must look ones best.</p>
<p>We were escorted by our Colonel   &amp;  the General's two A.D.C's. When we arrived there got a great welcome   &amp;  strange to say I did not feel at all nervous. The dear General was most charming   &amp;  said Now Sister Thistle-----  will you sit next to be [me]   &amp;  your Matron on my other side &ndash; so O'Dwyer   &amp;  I were each side of the Gen.</p>
<p>Then the other side of me was a Major Churchill (cousin to Winston) the Capt. Churnside, Capt. Bean, Our Colonel, General White. Sister Baker, General Corsowthers (cannot spell name)   &amp;  then two other Majors.</p>
<p>It was a lovely dinner but shall go into detail when I return.</p>
<p>It was the first time I had worn my two stars but I quite forgot I had an extra star. The General is such a love   &amp;  so homely, he cracked nuts for me etc. We dined from 7.30 p.m. till 10 p.m.</p>
