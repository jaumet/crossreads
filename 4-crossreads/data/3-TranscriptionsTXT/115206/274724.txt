Battery W.Lines.  near Pont NoyellesWeather delighful. I notice one R.H.A. Battery has pulled out on to the Footer Ground. Perhaps the gas last night was too much for them. Fritz is well down the Marne once again , - pas bien neuvill, Streaked into Bussy three times.Met Jack Harvey and spent a very salubrious evening. Had a glorious old gossip about things in general. he looks ever so fit. Spent a very quiet anniversary of departure from Australia for second time. Three years today, gee whiz.
