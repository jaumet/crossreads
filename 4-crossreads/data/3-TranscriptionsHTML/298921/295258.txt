<p>October, 1915<br/>Thursday 14<br/>Left Hospital in <u>Car</u> presented by Miss Gladys Weatherly of "Billilla" Brighton. "Billilla" Station on the &ndash; Darling -  I always read the donor's names &amp; often see old Ian McC's <u>car</u> with a load on of wounded &amp; sick. Busy fixing tent up again on the Desert, I gave away my Pots &amp; Pans when I left for the front so had to furnish anew. Found my horses well considering the unnatural life they have led I think it is creditable the Brigade is so good, in regard to the Horses. Saw Cutler, he is still driving the car, &amp; is well.<br/><strike>Found letter from Home dated Sept 4th a lot of news &amp; very acceptable.</strike></p>
