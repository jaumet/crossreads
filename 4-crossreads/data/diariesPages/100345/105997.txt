Wednesday July 12th 
marching through Amiens took nearly four hours it is a fine city: the roads were nicely laid out had the road in the middle footpath at each side with a row of large trees on each side of the footpath making four rows of trees in all they would be nice shady: the trams were funny little things: the river runs right through the town: the outer suburbs were a bit dowdy the people did not seem too much claso: passed miles of motor transports there were plenty of hospitals in the town: this is the Somme district: left Amiens behind passed through a little village: while resting a young woman came out with a jug of cafe handed it round. I got a cup it went well: passed through then along a lovely shady road for a couple of miles: the large trees met overhead looked well: arrived at Argoeuves about 8 am billeted: there was a rush for "scran" be we got a loaf a couple of dixies of milk each so done well: wash clean up then laid down: we struck a bit of a wire netting affair used as a bed it went well: up for tea went for a walk: had a look round the village cemetary it was full of wreaths made out of beads they did look well: met Barham Bolt Brown they look well: our plate of meat have had a rough passage the last few days we are a bit tender: these farms have plenty of pets, rabbits, pigs,goats, etc: our barn is not too bad electric light is all through the outhouses: Good luck to King Billy his white horse: it is two years to day since I went to board at Ethel's place:
