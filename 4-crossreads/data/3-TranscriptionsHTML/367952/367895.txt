<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>It is with deep regret that I have the sad duty on behalf of my Council, of expressing its sincere regret at the loss you have sustained through the death of your husband, the late Thomas Bell, who has been killed in action whilst fighting for his country.</p>
<p>I am desired and indeed myself feel compelled &ndash;to express to you my Council's sorrow and sincere sympathy with you and your family.</p>
<p>We pray that your natural grief may be lightened to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Believe me</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>Signed :  M North</p>
<p>Town Clerk</p>
