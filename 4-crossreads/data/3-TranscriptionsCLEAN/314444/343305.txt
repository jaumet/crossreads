 3rd verse (entirely) They were poor old British Tommies, who been camped way out near Hell In the silent-blazing desert, 'longside some brackish well. They'd been there to watch old Jacko, & keep him out of bounds But in tiresome dull existence they'd "forgot" their daily rounds. So he came in force & caught 'em, unprepared, & taking rest He smashed 'em up & drove them, in disorder, from their nest. 
 7th verse (entirely) First found, a thin old Bedouin sat underneath a palm, So fetched him under guard behind to see he did no harm. At noon we struck a Tommies Camp, abandoned but intact, They'd all cleared out & left it, strange thing but still a fact, They'd made things pretty comfy here, had beer & wine galore, No sign of Turk or any fight, or what they'd "squibbed" it for. 
 15th verse 7th line A poor old Tommy Sergeant who'd been fleeing from his foe, 8th [line] Had stopped there just because it was as far as he could go.
