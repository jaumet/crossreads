crying as they were dragged along, mothers had bundles of clothes in their arms, all that they could carry away from their homes. The sight was most pathetic. Others were a little more stolid, they walked away more calmly but they had a strained look on their faces.

Meeting in with S. Sgt M. we took a walk down the Lille road to be near to where the disaster was.

In an open space made for an entrance into a field we got a good view of the burning wagons. A thousand yards away columns of thick, black smoke mounted high into the air darkening the otherwise bright sky. Flames were licking up the wagons like the burning of a match box and from the exploding ammunition pieces of metal whizzed all around.

In the evening after the ammunition train had practically burned out we went down to see what remained of it.

The wagons had been utterly destroyed all that remain of them was a few twisted scarps of iron. Destroyed ammunition of all descriptions strewed the ground.

The bursting of shells had made two holes about thirty feet deep.
