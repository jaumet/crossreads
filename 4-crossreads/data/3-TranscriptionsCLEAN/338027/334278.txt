  
 Sunday, 29th November, 1914 Our last church parade on the Southern.  It is funny to listen to the various opinions of the men regarding the object in us of training in Egypt.  My opinion is that we are practically relieving the British garrison for a while and that our numbers, 35 000 may intimidate the hostile Turks & fanatics. 
 All afternoon was spent getting our kit together and at 5.30 p.m. we paraded in full marching order.  In the clouds at night I saw a strange phenomenon.  A mass of cloud had formed the exact shape of the map of England & Wales.  All the men saw it & thought the same. 
 Monday, 30th November, 1914 Exercised horses I hope for the last time in the morning in the p.m. we cleaned our saddles up a bit, the iron going very rusty with the sea air. 
 Everything is being hauled up for disembarkation.  All the other boats but our line have gone ahead.  This sounds as if we will go through the canal & disembark at Alexandria. 
 The sunset views are magnificent have to be seen to be believed.
