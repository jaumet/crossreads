by woman. I enjoyed myself immensely at this place.
Montivilliers is another big town near Havre, we had a route march to this place one day.
After spending a good time at the Base we left this place on Aug. 22nd 1917 for some then unknown destination. We left by train about 11. o'clock at night and found ourselves at Rouen the next morning We marched along the banks of the Seine to a rest camp. We remained here till 3. o'clock in the afternoon, after having attended to "little Mary's wants" Seine Rouen is a fine big town and is very pleasing to behold.
We left by train at 3. o'clock on Aug 23rd 1917 for a new destination We had good comfortable carriages this time, plenty of room in ours.
We found ourselves at Etaples the next morning, the train stayed here awhile
