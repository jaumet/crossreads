 Wed Nov 1st &ndash; 16 Myself with 2 other telephonists sent forward to take over the 12th DA exchange. After wading through mud up to our knees for about an hour we reached our destination and started duty straight away. Here we have to work 4 boards at once. 
 Thurs Nov 2nd &ndash; 16 Early this morning taubes were over and dropped bombs quite close to our exchange killing 7 men and wounding 2 
 During the afternoon only two 15 inch shells landed and of course one must drop on our stairway leading to the dugout and knock it in Luckily we had another entrance.
