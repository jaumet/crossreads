 Letter from Aunt Anna which is so interesting telling me all about old father's relatives. Did more Field work today. School closes tomorrow with EXAM. I have done well so far & am getting 2 days leave after. Saw Cuth Fetherston Hough & his wife. He should be getting his majority very soon now. 
 I am writing his Father today.
