 All Light Horse men sent ashore as picket gather up deserters, all aboard by 4 pm &ndash; the Boob is full awaiting their trial &ndash; several men admitted Hospital. D.T.'s &ndash; cuts &amp; bruises from rows.

None of the men apart from Pickel were allowed ashore. Nigs in galore around the Boat all day' diving &amp; selling stuff &ndash; coaling etc. A lot of nigs came aboard yesterday
