<p>April, 1915<br/>Friday 9<br/>Left today for Luxor 400 miles South &ndash; the site of Ancient Thebes &amp; the Libyan mountains &ndash; I have posted a Photo-book showing these Temples &amp; would advise you reading Baedeker on Egypt or Encyclopedia for information &ndash; all very wonderful to think of 3000 years B.C. &amp; yet the Paint in the Tombs is as fresh as if only done the day before. Karuak on one side &amp; Thebes on the other side of the Nile with the Tombs of Kings &amp; Queens in splendid condition.<br/>I took many photos &amp; will only hope they reach home. One really wants longer time, but we were lucky to get off.</p>
