<p>28 Nov, 1916<br/>Bayoud<br/>I had a horrible feeling I was going to be warned for stable Picquet last night but I missed &amp; Tom Sherry went on, &amp; at 6.30 I had my bed made down in my bivvie &amp; was well on my way to dreamland.  I could hardly beleive it this morning when Perce went round making that beastly "stand to" noise at 5.15.  Ten hours is a fair go any way so I could'nt grumble.  I was sent down on pump fatigue after breakfast &amp; felt that I had some thing against the cooks for being so late with breakfast as he had to break off eat ing to suddenly for his liking &amp; saddle up &amp; go to the pump.  The wells are over half mile away.  A sqad men did not turn up so he had a bit more exercise on the pump handle than I cared about then I drew to see who would releive the chap for dinner &amp; lost so thinks I have had a crook morning</p>
