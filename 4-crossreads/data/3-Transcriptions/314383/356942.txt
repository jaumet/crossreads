<p>An Armenian preacher has his wife &amp; family with us.  Tonight the wife is very low as she has been ill for some time.   Bound all the wounded ones in arrival at camp.</p>
<p>Aug 15<br/>Passed thro the most dangerous tract.  Kizal Bulahk to Perga.  Dead bodies are everywhere &amp; all stripped &amp; every spring is polluted with dead bodies &amp; water is about 20 miles apart.  Feeling very ill all day.</p>
<p>Aug 16<br/>Arrived Bijah 6 pm done up &amp; burning with fever.  I hardly remember the details of the day but thank God we have got the people to safety. I'm done.</p>
<p>A big mail waiting thank God for that cheer.</p>
