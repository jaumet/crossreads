  
 going to England would not prevent that if he wished me to take the job on, whereat he agreed & I am to see him again. Weather still good & their planes absent so are having a dinkum spell, very few wounded coming through. We have commenced to build a new dressing station here, the present one only being tents. 
 Monday 19th Aug. Went off to Vignacourt to No. 13 A.O.M.S. for drugs, Croney now being off our run. It was an interesting trip as we passed through Corbie, Aubigny, Daours etc places we had seen & been in before the hun started to smash them up. Corbie was well wrecked blocks of houses having been burnt out & the church had received several direct hits but was still standing. Inn Aubigny our late residence was razed to the ground but Daours was much the same as when we were shelled out, with the exception that a C.C.S. is now stationed there & several nurses were floating about. The roads are being repaired thoroughly & munition dumps carried forward. Obtained
