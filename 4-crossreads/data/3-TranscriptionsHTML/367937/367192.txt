<p>We never had time to get to the Queen's chamber and I was rather glad because it was jolly hard work climbing on the slippery marble with your head below your knees just after a week in bed with mumps.  However before we got out I had to give my guide another 3 piastres for showing me round and then as soon as we got out a man grabbed me and washed my hands with a drain of water and got &frac12;  Pt from me. We then all rode back down to the car and had to tip about 40 niggers for holding the donkeys &amp; getting in the way generally.  The most agonising thing about a camel is that when he sits down to let you off. You know they have pretty long legs and when they suddenly go down on their knees it is like trying to sit on the side of a wall and wretches always stop and argue before they lower away behind and you have to sit there and hang on for all you are worth.<br/>We had a lovely spin back in to Cairo in the evening and. We kept passing shepards taking their flocks of sheep and goats together home and saw the nigger kids riding their buffalo cows home.<br/>We took about half an hour to run into town; we stopped at Groppies got some sandwidges and cakes and I had an ice cream soda (a beauty} and then we came on out here to Abbassia.<br/>I could have taken an awful lot of photos but I only had time for seven.  I wanted to rush round and see everything myself and had not time to go changing films.<br/>I am sending you 20 views of Cairo: they are rather good.  I got the Dr to pass them here and then I did them up pretty securely.  I hope they don't want to censor them again as they will take a bit of undoing and they might stop them from going through rather than undo them; however I'll chance it and hope you get them.<br/>Next day 21st<br/>Sister has got a whole day off on Friday and was going to try and get us leave and take us to the Citadel and the zoo but I'm afraid we have to go down to "Grannie", as they call Ras-el-din, for our change of air tomorrow morning, so they put the cap on it.<br/>However I am jolly lucky to have seen the Pyramid.<br/>I heard yesterday that there are a lot of letters waiting for me at the camp so I wont be sorry to get back now.<br/>I have managed to get a green envelope to put this in it will save the Drs a bit of hard work as this letter is so long.  When you write please do tell me my mistake as I want to learn how to write a good letter.  I do hope you are having a good winter at home.  Must stop. Love to father. Good bye Mother. Ar'nt I a lucky boy to see all these things. Wish you and Father could have a trip round!<br/>I am your loving son Rob.</p>
