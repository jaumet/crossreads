<p>Thursday 27 February 1919\</p>
<p>Janet's Birthday</p>
<p>Got to Euston at 6.15 am &amp; then straight to Jermyn Court Hotel. Had to wait for brekker &amp; a shave. Went out &amp; saw about getting a job but missed everywhere. Was busy all day. Went to Marie's flat at 5.30 pm &amp; took the big parcel of greens &amp; the choc for Janet. Janet arrived late so we had to rush for dinner. Had a dinner at the Trocadero &amp; then went to see Hello America. It was very good. Very bright &amp; lively. Then back to the flat for supper. It was good too but none of us were hungry as we had eaten too many chocs.</p>
<p>Friday 28th February 1919<br/>Saw about playing football but crashed again. Don't seem to have much luck at present. Will see how we start tomorrow. Marie &amp; I went to the Zoo this afternoon &amp; enjoyed it. Had dinner at some Soho restaurant and then out to the Old Vic theatre to see a Shakespeare play. A Winter's Tale. Gee I enjoyed it. It was great. The acting being excellent. Sent a parcel of views &amp;  my two diaries home to mother.</p>
