&I wish it were over but the end is certain & in our favour.
I'm glad you had a jolly week in Sydney.  It is no use fretting & going about moaning.  Isn't it rotten all those mails being lost.  I foam at the mouth when I think of it, I look forward to your letters so.
I'm sorry you have felt pippy but I can understand.  How is the dear old Boss and Grahame & Mac.  I haven't had any word from Miss Arn or Mrs. Johnson for months.  I hope they are all right.  We have moved again, I have such a nice house (one room) now.  Also an assistant so I'm getting on but getting very grey.  My French is still awful but I got on well with it in Paris.  Went to Maxims, very gorgeous.  Had some beautiful feeds.  (He does love his little 'tum' he does.)
We are having a very lively time but casualties have eased off a bit thank heaven.  Still to go to the old battery is painful so few of the original crowd.
