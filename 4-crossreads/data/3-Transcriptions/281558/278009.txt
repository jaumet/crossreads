<p>roam round Bapaume after tea : went into the vault under the ruined Cathedral &amp; seen the skulls : there are hundreds of them &amp; the tale is that they are the victims of the French revolution : heavy storm at night : thunder bad &amp; lightening very vivid : mere mortals &amp; their power seem very puny in comparison with nature : yarned before turning in, with the Lithgow "knuts"</p>
<p>Sunday July 8th</p>
<p>Bapaume : rain &amp; very muddy : Holy Com at 9.30 &amp; about 40 present : laid down after tea</p>
<p>Monday July 9th</p>
<p>Bapaume : showery : reveille 3.45 am : fell in in battle order &amp; marched to our "stunt" ground : I was attached to the A.M.C. [Aust Medical Corps] for the day so done very little : the "boys" put in a heavy day &amp; "advanced" a long way so finished up pretty tired.</p>
