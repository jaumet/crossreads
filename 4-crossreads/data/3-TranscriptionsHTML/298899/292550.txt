<p>in 1245 by St Louis it consists of an upper &amp; lower chapel &amp; was built to contain the crown of thorns &amp; a piece of the real cross obtained from the Emperor of Constantinople. The principal feature consists of the stained glass windows which are the most complete example of the work of the latter part of the 13th century &amp; are extremely beautiful. Each of the windows is a dazzling jewel, the large rose which dates from Charles VIII being divided into 79 frames, the whole having a glorious effect. We bought postcards etc before leaving. Next we strolled through the Palais de Justice into some of the Law courts but it being the meal hour, the Court was adjourned. The Notre Dame then claimed our attention as we had not seen the interior the day before. On entering we saw before us a man sitting at a table holding a brush. His job was to dip the brush into Holy water &amp; touch the hand of those coming in, we perforce had to collect our sample. So many people coming in means that several Holywater founts are provided &amp; at times one sees one person dipping their hand in &amp; touching the hand with it of their friends or those nearby.
