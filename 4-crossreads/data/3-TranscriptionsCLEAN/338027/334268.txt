  
 Memorable Monday, 9th November, 1914 As I prophesied two days ago that there would be something doing in a day or two.  About eight oclock in the morning one of the boats rec S.O.S. message & the four cruisers steamed away.  The next we knew was that the Sydney had sunk the pirate Emden or rather beached her on Cocos Islands.  She was next heard of having the Cruisers [indecipherable] and Konigsberg .  My best description is in poetry I wrote.  Had a patriotic concert in night in honour of it.  Col shouted for every man. 
 Another man died & buried on the ill fated Euripodes [Euripides], on this memorable day that made the Aust. Navy famous. 
 Tuesday, 10th November, 1914 Heat terrific only a day off the equator, the men are doing their duties stark naked.  We hosed horses to-day and the splashing & laughing was like a lot of schoolboys swimming.  On an average I have about five showers a day. 
 There are four more deaths of men reported from neighbouring boats but we do not know anything about those in the rear. 
 The true facts concerning the sinking of the Emden are to hand and as space is not allowable here am writing this in my note book sufficient to say that the Sydney also captured German collier took the crew off her & sunk her then took the crew off the Emden & sailed direct for Colombo.
