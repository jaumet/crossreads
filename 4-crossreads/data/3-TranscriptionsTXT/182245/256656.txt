 21 MONDAY 
 Fine &amp; warm. Cleaning harness in 
 morning &amp; I went out to load 
 amunition at L&#39;Epinette dump 
 in afternoon &amp; was there all afternoon 
 We juggled about 5000 18 inch 
 shells &amp; it was no holiday either 
 Heard Fritz was strafing our 
 positions. Went up with the 
 waggons at night &amp; found Fritz 
 had knocked thing about a 
 bit &amp; set fire to the dump which 
 was still burning with 2000 
 rounds ammunition in it. He 
 put a few more over while we were 
 there. D &amp; F sub guns were outed 
 &amp; had to go to ordinance, &amp; a 
 couple (Serg. Kill &amp; Bom Dowling) 
 got slight shrapnell wounds. 
 Gunners lost all personel 
 equiipment ect except what 
 they stood up in.
