<p>The Boys</p>
<p>buried with heads protruding underfoot.  In one place became one corpse known to everyone.  A great bulging yellow eye enormously enlarged glaring out of the head of a dead man lying on the parapet.  Through the village. One man sitting against a tree his legs with raw "woolly" looking tops lying beside him completely severed.  In my section of trench the fat gas-inflated stomach of a German protruding from the trench floor and the elderly man lying in groping position as if trying to crawl into the earth.  The little chap of 19 with blood all over his face leaning back dead and stinking against the wheel of his gun.  Our men's cries of "Jesus: God: Hell" and the crying when a shell landed in among them.  The dreadfully injured man who walked in dead silence to a corner of the trench and stood gaping sillily at the awful mutilations to the front of his body.<br/>The chapel of Ypres had heaps of ruined statues.  Many of them were robed figures and to one with outstretched hands the lads affixed a placard "[you gib it backsheese".</p>
<p>At Orderly room one of the old heads was up for A.W.L from parade and said he had been 'crook in the guts" and when he recovered the Battalion had marched on and he could not find them. CO.:- Did you parade to the Dr?  OH:- "What's the good of doing that, they only give yer one of this or one of that".</p>
<p>The 27Btn. let us down in a ticklish corner by retiring and our boys have a grudge against them.  In an Orderly room case it was rather funny "We had an argument with some blokes.  Jones brother in law got cracked with bottle).</p>
