  
 how I do wish it was ended. Such fine men, made helpless for life - the saddest cases I think are those who have lost their eyesight & there are such numbers. I do hope you will all like Sister Murray, she is very thin but an awfully jolly sort  & most intelligent, most likely she will ring-up or get out to see you, she is sure to visit Agnes' friend. You have not sent me Ag nor Bessie's address. Must stop now. Fondest love & kisses to you all.  From                                                                                                                                                                                                            Yours lovingly                                                                                                                                                                                                      Edith    What size is Eddy's  head ?
