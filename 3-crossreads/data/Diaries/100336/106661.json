All went well till about 11.30 p.m. when a destroyer was seen approaching us at full speed.  All hands were immediately called and the wireless mast had to be got down before we could dive.  However we got down in good time and remained down for about have an hour.  When we thought all was safe we came to the surface and found nothing in sight, so we all settled down again excepting two men on watch.  We were not allowed to rest long for a gunboat painted white had sneaked up in the mist and got to within about 200 yards of us.  She immediately opened fire on us with three pounder guns.
