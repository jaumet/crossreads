<p>23<br/>Have not met Ron yet.</p>
<p>Try and manage as well as you can on our small income of 4/- per day, but if possible get the allowance for yourself and the children for I am merely a sapper still.</p>
<p>My own needs are not great.</p>
<p>That amount they have compelled me to re-pay is nearly made up now so I will soon draw more than 2/- per week.</p>
<p>The main this is to win the fight which we will do</p>
<p>With love<br/>Geoff</p>
