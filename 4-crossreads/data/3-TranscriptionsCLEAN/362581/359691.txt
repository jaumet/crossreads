 My darling Eddy, 
 How I should love to give you a big hug   &  kiss. Darling your letters are lovely and I'm always very delighted to get them.  You are quite a clever boy writing your own name so well. Thank you very much for the two birthday post cards you sent me. I received the one with the Flags on my birthday   &  the one with the Pussies the day after. They are beautiful cards   &  it was very clever of you to send it just at the right time. I am much better was up yesterday for a while   &  feel splendid to-day. Hope Gran, Auntie   &  Mummie are quite recovered from the Influenza. Hope you are well. Fondest love   &  kisses  From Auntie Eadle XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
