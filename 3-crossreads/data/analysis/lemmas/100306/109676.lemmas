 28/1/17 Ribemont there . Befor lunch ed drank some coffe with Madam and then afterward with the Doctor walk down to see Col . Smith at Dernacourt . Cold and a chilli sun . The road quiet be a Sunday . Buir and the other villag both quiet and the walk rather devoid of interest . We walk over pond which were solid ice as far down as one could see and where usual there was mud there is now ice . The central place of interest in each littl villag is the church . Those at Ribemont and Dernacourt have squar tower , the Buir one has a Flemish aspect . The wall in each case are grey with age . The local church is 200 year old say Madam and at Buir they claim an age of 800 for the tower . On the outsid of the tower are some of those quaint grotesqu littl imag the French seem to like to reliev the sever of their church with . Discuss some topic some whiski with Fight Bob and return home onc more . All prepar under way for our shift tomorrow to Becourt .
