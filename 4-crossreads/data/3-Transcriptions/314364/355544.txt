<p>Sat. Feb.8.<br/>Our deck is full up now &amp; it was quite exciting slinging our Hammocks last night. We left the Docks just on the stroke of 10 a.m. I'm hanged if I can realise that we are going home. I keep on thinking that I shall wake up presently &amp; find it all a dream. I don't feel a wee bit sorry at leaving Blighty. The whole country seems to be on strike. The British working man is evidently waking up &amp; about time he did.<br/>The scenery as we left the vicinity of Plymouth was very pretty &amp; for a wonder <u>the sun actually shone</u>. The weather seemed to change immediately we dropped the Pilot, &amp; tonight the Boat has got quite a roll on. Many of the crowd are complaining of being sick already. I felt quite tired after Tea &amp; was very glad to hop into my Hammock. We had 5 cases of Influenza aboard yesterday, but they were sent ashore before we sailed. I'll bet they didn't "go sore". Well, I <u>think </u> I can safely say that I'm on my way Home now. I wonder what Lill will say when she hears that I'm coming Home <u>at last</u>. I feel real sorry for the poor beggars who were put ashore. They were certainly very "stiff".<br/>There are a number of civilian passengers on the Boat, &amp; several Ladies besides our 30 Nursing Sisters, so we have quite an interesting crowd aboard. The weather is quite fresh tonight &amp; quite a lot of the chaps are sick already.</p>
