 Give my love to Birt and Mrs. Bilney also the children. Remember me to all the Flanagans. I hope Dolly is better by this time. I am very off colour to day. I do not feel to good at all. We have just been payed a pound to day. Well I expect every thing on my place is all right. Have you heard the Boss say how the horses are looking, the sheep should be in good condition. Well I must say Good Bye for the present. W.W.
