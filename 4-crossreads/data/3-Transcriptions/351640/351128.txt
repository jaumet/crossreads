<p>Hope that you will play at the Philharmonic, because the doing so will keep up your music for my return.<br/>I wrote to Dr. Fisher thanking him and his good wife for being so kind to you. Every boy should be made to work, and with an object in view, it brings out what may be latent in him and keeps him progressing; nothing is so bad for young people as want of occupation and direction to some achievement. Both the Fisher boys should be bundled off to the war, it will make men of them if anything can.</p>
<p>Letters from you Tabbie Geordie may reach me tomorrow if so they will be answered for the next mail boat.</p>
<p>Just fancy with a little imagination one might report that there was rain in Heliopolis this morning, a cloud hung around the city moistened the ground &amp; walking through it one felt wet. Mirabile dictu!</p>
<p>Now for Pat Watt &amp; Mrs Franki.<br/>Good bye for the present:&ndash; [A line of Xs and Os.] Car. [A line of Xs and Os.] Joe. [A line of Xs and Os.] Kit</p>
<p>22-11-15. Another day has dawned in Egypt. Like unto yesterday the early hours were ushered in by a thick mist which some people, who know not better, might designate rain; there must have been something irritating about it this morning because at its falling about 5 to 6 a.m. an epidemic of coughing passed through the patients in the wards but short distance removed from my window.</p>
<p>3 p.m. No further letters have come to me. A bundle of newspapers of date 9th October &amp; thereabout came from Freddie Fletcher of Newcastle. I have written to thank him.</p>
