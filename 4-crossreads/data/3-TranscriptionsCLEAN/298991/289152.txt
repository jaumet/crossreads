 Saturday March 24th Handed pay book in today to be audited. They are audited every month. Was off for three hours this afternoon, & played cards all the time I was off. Very quiet. On an average  we h  nine on leave every week, so I oughtn't to be long, getting over on leave now. 
 Sunday March 25th A very nice day. All clocks were put on an hour, midnight last night, as the daylight savings system comes in 24-25th March here, of course we were deprived of an hours sleep & my word it was noticeable too. My half day off today. Went for a walk down & about Boulogne, but came back pretty early.
