<p>New England Soldiers' Club.<br/>A.M.C. Military Camp,<br/>Armidale.<br/>Sunday, 12th March 1915 [16]</p>
<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother/.<br/>As you will see by the heading a Military Club has now been formed at Armidale, and I am taking advantage of the seclusion afforded by the writing room to write this letter.<br/>It was only opened yesterday and the membership fee is 1/- per month. It consists of a very fine room packed with small tables for reading and games, (books, dominoes, draughts, &amp;c. being procurable on the premises) and another smaller room for writing.</p>
<p>We have been kept as busy as possible at the Hospital. The number of mumps cases is gradually dwindling but measles are coming in daily. There are still about 80 in hospital only twelve of whom are general cases i.e. other than mumps and measles. Three of our own men are in bed, one with mumps, one with measles, and one with influenza.<br/>On account of the large proportion of sick, the P.M.O. Major Lawes, paid a flying visit to the Camp last Tuesday. As the Tenth Field Ambulance was picked recently and none of our names included, we all paraded before him to enquire the reason for their omission as many of us have been in camp longer than some of those who were selected for it.</p>
