<p>several people and eventually decided it would not be a fair thing for me to go as a medico &ndash; you see I've never practiced at all and am only a quack doctor.  So I'm now in the Field Artillery and start training at St. John's Wood as soon as my gear and kit is ready:  it will be very interesting work, and with any luck at all I may get a chance against the Germans after all.</p>
<p>London is kept very dark and gloomy at nights &ndash; very few lights, it is almost dangerous the way the motors dash about in semi gloom:  there have been no "Zeps" here since I arrived, &amp; I hope there won't be any:  apparently the cold winter is not the best time for flying in Zeppelins.</p>
<p>It was sad about poor Sami Milson:  there are numbers of Australians here from Gallipoli and some of them knew him:  all of them are unanimous in hoping they won't be sent back there, no doubt they had a tough time of it.</p>
<p>I hope you got through that New Guinea trip safely, or whatever outlandish place you proposed taking a holiday in:  I shall not be satisfied till I get a letter saying you are back again &ndash; you say nothing in your letter about the fellows in Gallipoli, so I hope no news of them is good:  please write again when you have any spare time and, like Alison Walker, I'll promise not to be angry even if it is a long letter.  Remember me to John, little John &amp; Frank Lavender:  I got a cable from him about the Carrathool sale.  With kind regards and all good luck.  Ever yours sincerely</p>
