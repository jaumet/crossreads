[Bolchevik message thrown over the fence from the Internees Camp at Holdsworthy during the time of the prisoner's strike there (March 1919).
It was wet weather at the time and the message was wrapped up in this way in order to keep it dry. There were a number of other similar messages thrown over but they were destroyed. The instigator of the strike was an internee named Heyne.
(To be kept wrapped as found)]
