<p>On my return I met men who had been to tennis &amp; to cricket &amp; to that awful form of amusement &amp; waste of time &amp; temper &ndash; talking to young women &amp; their mamas  -  I suppose its all right but I cant stand that in a new land with a wealth of natural objects all around me &ndash; many of the men loaf up to the Pacific hotel have drinks or aft tea &amp; sit &amp; smoke till its time to return to the ship &amp; they think that jolly &amp; quite enough exercise  -  Well give me the strenuous battler at tennis or cricket &ndash; the man who does somewhat &amp; the woman who enthuses &amp; tries to do &amp; always succeeds too in doing things  -  Well &ndash; well  -  There's no venomous snakes in Fiji I am told &amp; that shows perhaps why 'ricky ticky' has his attentions so directed to birds  -  Do you remember <u>our</u> 1st Cup at Flemington  -  I do &ndash; well &ndash; Chambers was there &ndash; as jolly as theyre made  -  Judge Molesworth gave a lunch &amp; we had a ripping day  -  It's a long while ago is it not?</p>
