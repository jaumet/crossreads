 Dull & Showery 
 Walk miles looking for a sit down like a Gippo with his Water-Bottle. I sit in office write. Recd letters from Esme & Maisie Hudson. Billiard Table mended. We have the riot by M.O.'s & C.O. over Diet. We all come a gutzer. I have a row with Registrars. 
 Wrote M.R.L., Auntie Annie & Jennie. 
 15 February, Saturday 
 F & Dull. Rain 5 pm. 
 We admit  100 Patients . I wash Hankeys & clean up room. No musician & I play all Dances. I am lonely 'cos Dick is absent. I walk Home with Doris & Fassy & Stupe. R.A.F.'s play Billiards in Mess. I go to Dick's flat & write. Nice warm day which is quite a change.
