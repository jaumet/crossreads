<p>Sir ,</p>
<p>It was with deepest regret that I learned the sad news of the death of your son at the front.</p>
<p>Captain Ferguson was the officer commanding my platoon Whilst Gallipoli, and, as one who has served under him, I wish to say that he was at all times an Officer and a Gentleman. Amongst his many other sterling qualities, he at all times shoed a kindly interest for his men, being ever anxious for their welfare.</p>
<p>You have my sincere sympathy in your great loss.</p>
<p>Believe me to be,<br/>Sir ,<br/>Your obedient servant ,<br/>L.L. Goodsall</p>
