 Wed 3rd Apl. Just as the troop-train was pulling out the Brass that graciously yielded to the prayers and entreaties of my unteroffizer and granted us permission to travel with the troops. 
 We swung on to the moving train and squeezed into a 3rd class compartment crammed with young and youngish Huns all clad in the regulation greenish-grey and little peak-less caps.   As we passed between the docks fringing the Elbe and crossed the Elbe itself I had some most interesting views of the huge Merchant Fleet rusting there. 
 One dock which we passed was packed with beautiful passenger vessels of about 7000 tons all a mass of rust. 
 The river itself was crammed with ships, big two and three funnellers being very noticeable.
