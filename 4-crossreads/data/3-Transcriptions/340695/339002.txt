<p>20-8-17. The Bosche has afforded us great excitement of late. He comes over every night &amp; lays "eggs" but our huge search lights are too good for him they find him every time &amp; of course once in that strong beam of light he is blinded so drops all his bombs &amp; makes for home. It is a grand sight they look like huge white birds with our guns greeting them on their way. One passed right over our heads the other night but fortunately for us he let loose his bombs before reaching us. It was a magnificent spectacle a sight of a life time. No mail since the 29th of last month regarding our news from Home things are pretty crook.<br/>21-8-17 &ndash; Three letters from Home &amp; a heart broken one from Dorie poor Kiddie she was frightfully cut up.</p>
