I went into the Savoy with a urgent to Gen Faire re remounts but could get no satisfaction, came out in a hurry went to the review which was nothing like the ones of old. Mick M has got 6 months furlough to Australia Steel 12 months in the afternoon I rode one of the remounts he gave me a rough passage what with aeroplanes eagles, it was none to pleasant for either the horse or I.
