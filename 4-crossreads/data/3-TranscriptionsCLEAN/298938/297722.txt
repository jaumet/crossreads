  
 4:XI:16 Busy as usual. Have been made L/Corporal this week as the establishment is out. Promised more later, but still count myself lucky if I can get away with permanent L/Corp. rank to France.  There it will be something to work on. Received more letters from Base including 2 from  2  dear old Rita, one from  P.J.  Rev Nyland, a nice Christmas card from little Andy Steen at school
