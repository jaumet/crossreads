 Saturday 10 August 1917 [1918] All Sisters up on the mat 8 p.m. for lecture.  (1) Pts. very noisy in wards, i.e., one bed fell, legs tucked up, when pt. got in, another pt. not in bed.  Oh! I've been talking to him, says the sister.  (2) Sisters  must  report to me if late for dinner.  The scene &ndash; Miss Cheetham stout, fat &amp; undignified sitting in front &amp; standing some 16 or 18 sisters Aust.  What time she harangues the crowd.  We feel like 2 year olds once more. Arrive on duty find pts. 48, 4 new &ndash; 1 dysentery amoebic, 3 malaria &ndash; all wild.  10.40 comes Maj. Leach, "I like the Aust. no matter what people say".  Treat them as human beings &amp; they will be alright but try to bully them!  How do I laugh quietly at these English.
