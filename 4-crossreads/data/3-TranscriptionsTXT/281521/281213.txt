 17/4/17 Bullecourt Comemorative Monument is a small granite stone surrounded with green trees. Yarned for a while with Colonel Ralston, Pedler, Major Watson also officer. Then adjourned to mess where were Major-General Smythe and Generals Smith, Gellibrand and Brand etc. We discussed matters for a while and took notes. After this walked back to Trnasport at rear of Favrieul and got horse. Changed into fighting kit at Q.M.'s store and rode back home. Roads extremely bad and cut up. The guns extremely thick and active right up and all our places being shelled. Padre conducted weird funeral services tonight over our dead men. Went to Bde. H.Q.s and had a discussion with the General who was in a comical humour. Some heavy strafe during evening. Snow. A company relief carried out without casualties. Some shells landed nearly on top of this flimsy structure but not quite &ndash; just as well
