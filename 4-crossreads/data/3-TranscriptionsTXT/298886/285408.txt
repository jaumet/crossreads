Three men of mine had been previously told off as baggage guard which left 3 &amp; myself with 7 horses. When we got to the station 2 more were told to go &amp; guard some stores leaving one now &amp; I to hold the horses I have, in the course of some of my career experienced some rough nights &amp; some particularly cold one but I have not put in such a night as I did then, for years.
