1/11/17 Naples
After dinner went up to the Via Roma by train and found the street full of a crowd walking up and down. Many of the shops were open. The chief Mecca of the promenaders was a big arcade in which are many cafes and good shops. There was also a string band playing and people of the better sort evidently put in most of their time walking up and down. The beggars are dreadful. Two poor little boys about 6 ? one crouched asleep against the wall on the pavement, the other, blind, sitting silent with his poor little sightless eyes and small face turned up towards Heaven. In out of the way places round corners and up side streets sit these poor devils of all ages clamouring for alms. The inhabitants quarrel a lot among themselves and exchange blows with sticks and fists accompanied by a great deal of tongue thrashing ? just like the Gyppies!
