<p>day when the bombardment before our first attack was tearing the branches from off the trees 100 yards away, Pozieres had a fairly decent covering then.  There was enough dead brushwood and twigs, at any rate, to hide the buildings of the place.  A few pink walls could then be half seen behind the branches, or topping the gaps in the scrub.</p>
<p>Within four days the screen in front of Pozieres had been torn to shreds &ndash; had utterly disappeared.  The German bombardment ripped off all that the British had left.  The buildings now stood up quite naked, such as they were.  There was the church still recognisable by one window, and a scrap of red wall at the north-east end of the village, past which you had to crawl to reach an isolated scrap of trench facing the windmill.  Both trench and red wall have long since gone to glory.  I doubt if you could even trace either of them now.  The solitary church window disappeared early, and a tumbled heap of bricks is all that now marks Pozieres church.  One scrap of gridironed roof sticking out from the powdered ground, cross-hatches the horizon.  There is not so much foliage left as would shelter a single cock-sparrow</p>
<p>And Courcelette is in front.</p>
<p>But here were we, with this desolation behind us, looking out suddenly, and at no great distance, on quite a respectable wood.  It tempted you to step out there and just walk across to it.  I never see that country without the feeling that one is quite free to step across there and explore it.</p>
<p>There are men coming up the further side of the slope &ndash; men going about some normal business of the day, as our men go about theirs in the places behind their lines.</p>
<p>Those men are Germans; and the village in the trees, the collection of buildings half guessed in the wood, is Courcelette. Away in the landscape behind, in some hollow, there humps itself into the air a big fountain of chestnut dust.  One has seen German shell burst so often in that fashion back in our hinterland that it takes a moment to realize that this shell is not German, but British.  I cannot see what it is aimed at &ndash; some battery, I suppose or perhaps a much-used road, or some place they suspect to be head-quarters.  Clearly it is not always so safe as it seems to be in the green country behind the German line.</p>
<p>London, 18th October, 1916.<br/>In receiving to-day a party of Canadian and Australian journalists on board this great flagship, in the midst of the grand Fleet, Admiral Jellicoe sent the Dominions this message:-</p>
<p>"What I can say is &ndash; go on as you have begun."</p>
<p>I was to-day on board the Warspite, which the Germans claim to have sunk, but which, on the contrary, steamed after the battle to a home port at full speed.  The spirit of the men and officers is splendid.  A few scars of the Jutland battle are the pride of their lucky possessors.</p>
<p>I have seen during these last days ships of the Australian Navy occupying very honourable positions in the great Fleet on which the whole cause of democracy, humanity, and civilization rests.  In any great naval action which the war has still to bring, Australian ships may be expected to play an important part.  The crews are in fine spirits.</p>
<p>London, 25th October 1916.<br/>I have been visiting for nearly a week factories and dockyards, where the guns, shells, warships, and aeroplanes are being manufactured, whereby Britain intends to bring this war to an end, on which the Allies will determine.  We often wondered in France whether our guns must not be making inroads on the huge supplies of ammunition stored up for the great offensive.  The truth is, at the end of four months of incessant bombardment, the British supplies of ammunition</p>
