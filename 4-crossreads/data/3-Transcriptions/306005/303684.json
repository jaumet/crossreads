<p>6-1-17<br/>Sat 6th<br/>Had a fine day for a change &amp; an enemy 'plane with it, but she dropped no bombs &amp; two of our 'planes lost no time in getting up after her chasing her away. Wint  went away early this morning; 6 Sqdn captured a Turkish gramaphone at Maghaba &amp; the Dr has been using Turkish records on the officers machine this afternoon, they are rather queer productions, reminds one of the drinking shops of Cairo. Received a parcel from home today.</p>
