<p>make use of Sydney leave next week.<br/>April 1 Sunday<br/>I &amp; some of the boys went for a swim to the Goulbourn River<br/>Monday April 2<br/>Leave for Sydney from Good Friday night. Deputation paraded to OC asking for permission to go Thursday &amp; be home for Good Friday Informed department too busy carrying Tourists to supply trains for soldiers.<br/>Anticipate trouble.<br/>Wednesday April 4<br/>All hands have to pay 38/- before going on leave for fare. Another roar [possibly war]. Only way out for us to have a Kentucky which we did &amp; raised sufficient for our unit.<br/>Thursday April 5<br/>Informed drill as usual on Good Friday. In My opinion bad</p>
