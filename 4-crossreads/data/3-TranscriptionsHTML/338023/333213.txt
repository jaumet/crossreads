<p>you look and the monotony broken by wind breaks of splendid pines &amp; firs or dense belts of blue gum &amp; wattle. The latter is all in flower &ndash; several kinds &ndash; and makes a fine show. Altogether one gets the impression of being in a warmer, greener &amp; cleaner country north of the Murray.</p>
<p>Got back here on Monday &amp; same night some of the boys got into a mix up in Seymour through an M.P. knocking a woman &amp; kid down while attempting to arrest the husband on some silly charge. One of "The Knuts" interfered &amp; succeeded in getting arrested as well but later on both were let go by order of the Provost. However the matter could not be called settled there, so on Tuesday night the mob went in to straighten out a few accumulated grievances. When, having shot up a pub, locked the M.P.s in the local cells, commandeered the horses of  <u>The Force</u> and caused sundry jobs for the ambulance, they had finished. The men remaining in camp were called out, hastily armed, &amp; prepared for action. Then at the last moment word arrived that the mob was coming home in  a good humor to say "beg pardon" -  so no battle took place.</p>
