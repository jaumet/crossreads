  
 towards the end of t his cruel war. 
 I have had several letters from my pals, in the 5th Div.   &  they had come though safely. None from the boys of 1st   &  2nd Div.. they did wonderfully well but am afraid a number have been killed   &  wounded. Though there has been very few casualties. 
 I think I told I had a field P.Card from Charlie   &  a letter now.
