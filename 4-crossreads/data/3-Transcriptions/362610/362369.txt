<p>Friday 2 June 1916<br/>A lovely day. In the morning had a parade of the company, the CO coming round to inspect them. It was the first opportunity I had had of speaking to the Colonel &amp; I thought he was fine : one could speak quite freely to him. In the afternoon as we were about to sit down to lunch word came that the company had to go out at once to take part in a little tactical scheme. This took us out to Estaires &amp; thence along the River Lys as far as Bac St. Maur &amp; back to Sailly. My party on the river bank had the best position of the 3, &amp; I quite enjoyed the march altho' it was nearly 5.30 by the time we reached home.<br/>Found that Rid &amp; Leo had been in to see me, &amp; later the former called in again &amp; I was able to give him a cup of tea before he left on his bike ride back to H.Q. It was good to see him again.</p>
