<p><u>15th November, 1916.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been told that the pea soup variety of</p>
<p>London fog had of late years become a rarity, but this year looks like</p>
<p>making up for lost time - or fogs.&nbsp;&nbsp; A clean fog is bad enough, but</p>
<p>these London affairs seem to have got mixed up with smoke from</p>
<p>thousands of chimneys until they assume a greenish black color.&nbsp; They</p>
<p>penetrate everywhere and completely disorganize London.&nbsp; For a while</p>
<p>the vehicles grope their way about and much tooting or horns, and head-</p>
<p>lights which at ordinary times would be dazzling but are now a blur in</p>
<p>the fog, visible perhaps fifteen or twenty feet only.&nbsp; After a whilex</p>
<p>they give it up and motorbuses, taxis etc. begin to crawl back to their</p>
<p>garages, the drivers finding it dangeroous to stay out longer.&nbsp; Since</p>
<p>the Zeppelin visits started these are the only occasions on which London</p>
<p>is allowed to light up and as the one I saw was the first bad fog of the</p>
<p>season, there was a hurried overhauling of lamps and fittings both on</p>
<p>vehicles and in buildings.&nbsp; A thousand-candle-power roaring petroleum</p>
<p>flare set up as a beacon in the Strand near Trafalgar Square as a guide</p>
<p>to stray vehicles, was invisible at 100 feet - just a hissing noise in</p>
<p>the fog.&nbsp; By five o&#39;clock in the evening practically all surface</p>
<p>traffic had stopped and it was said that footsteps could be heard in</p>
<p>Piccadilly -&nbsp; surely a record for this, the noisiest corner on earth.</p>
<p>The Tubes were the only unaffected means of travel and the scramble on</p>
<p>the platforms and in the subways reminded one of the rush for shelter</p>
<p>on Zeppelin nights to these excellent dugouts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extravagance is still the order of the day in London,</p>
<p>despite the fact that prices are soaring upwards.&nbsp; The Carlton, Princes, Romanos, The Ritz, The Savoy, in fact all the expensive restaurants,</p>
<p>are crowded nightly and unless a table is reserved before about 6.30,</p>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxx accommodation cannot be guaranteed.&nbsp; Look into any</p>
<p>theatre and you will see a thousand people or more, rocking with</p>
