<p>His no use as a stand by in any altercation with the wasters here &ndash; he sides with the last man who speaks in any argument.  I feel very sorry for him but he is getting very stupid.   I will help him as much as I can during the voyage &amp; at the end will counsel him to remain in Australia &amp; not come back here again.  I met Mr Knox the Red X commissioner &ndash; he arrived yesterday &ndash; I told him quite a lot of strange things.<br/>I got your letter all right also the one in parcel of clothes &ndash; glad Fred was able to look after you.<br/>I am quite anxious to know the results of your bustling about on my job &ndash; but have no doubt good will come of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a shame to worry you when you were so busy making your final arrangements.<br/>Hope you have nice cabins if not try &amp; change them &ndash; best love to all the children &amp; hoping to see you all soon &amp; that you will be well &amp; comfortable on the voyage.<br/>Your own old man<br/>Will.</p>
