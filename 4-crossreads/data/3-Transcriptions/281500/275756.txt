<p>Have charge of Hqr's guard tonight and have 5 prisoners to look after some of them bad characters, they are all waiting for Court Martials. <br/>16th Today is a beauty nice and sunny with never a cloud to be seen, but very cold, gives one a good appetite. <br/>Len has taken no 11 platoon away today on baggage guard so that means that we will be shifting tomorrow I expect. There was an issue of sheepskin gloves and socks this evening. <br/>17th Went to the pictures again last night missed the first sitting and had to wait for 2 hours in a long queque. This morning we packed up again and moved off again in motor cars.<br/>There was also a band concert given by the 3rd Batt this morning and it was real good old Mac was the organiser of it.</p>
