Thur. JAN. 11. We got back to the Hall just as they were having Dinner, which the Y.M.C.A. had provided. The walk had whetted our appetites & we thoroughly enjoyed the Steak & Bacon & other good things. We had a rehearsal at 2, which went off well, our Pianist (Frank Newton) being in great form. Had Tea at 4, plenty Bread & Butter & Cakes. Then we commenced to make up for the Show, which was billed to start at 6. As soon as the Doors were opened the crowd rushed in & we had a "Full House" in double quick time. The show went off splendidly, everyone seemed to be at their Best. Several items were encored. The Sketch also took very well. "Oriss" & Madame Melbum taking their parts to Perfection. Billsy May took Payneys place & sung his two songs admirably. The "Belle of N York" went off very well too. After the Show, Mr Greenberg complimented us on the Show & said he never expected to see anything near as good. He also gave us Hot Tea & Cakes, before we got aboard the Cars & returned to Olincourt.

We had Tea & then got ready for the Show. Last night the acting Brigadier & about a dozen other officers were present & spoke very highly of our Show. We got going at 6.30 & the crowd seemed to enjoy it even better that last night. "Orris" was in great form, & his antics greatly amused the crowd. We finished about 9 & returned Home in the G.S. waggon, tired & happy.
