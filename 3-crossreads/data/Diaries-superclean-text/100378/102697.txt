15th November '16
Early morning Stables after reveille 5 a.m. Left camp at 7.30 for stunt. Had a good ride out for about six miles from camp. Horse holders let our horses go which resulted in a stampede. My horse was badly hurt, and I left them in bivouac to bring her to camp. The Vet. bandaged her up, but I am afraid she will be bad for some time. Did not go out after I came home to camp.
