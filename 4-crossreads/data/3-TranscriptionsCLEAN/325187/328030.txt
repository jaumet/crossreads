 Connie & Laura Theatre  Misleading Lady  - Globe- around the clock. Went & saw Mardi Ritchie at Swedish Hospital, she looks so sweet in Uniform  I introduced my wife so that she could tell you what she is like. Took Laura & Connie to Globe Theatre to see "When the Clock goes around" a pretty little show.  Tea at Trocadero Dinner at Frascati I'm getting a bit tired of spending money on all this frivol.
