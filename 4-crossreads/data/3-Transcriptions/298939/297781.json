<p>aristocracy (!) of England has held over the Schools until quite recently; in fact even now they have a tremendous influence in scholastic affairs.<br/>For instance Lady Rodgett at the "Hall", (the occupants of which have always governed the school) would allow no girl leaving school to go into any thing except service, for which she fitted them out; as she owned the houses their parents occupied, they had no other choice.  That is a very significant fact, &amp; it happened until within the last few years</p>
