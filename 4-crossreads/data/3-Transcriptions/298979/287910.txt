<p>The third shell had come right through the top of the parapet &amp; the spot, exactly where the man on duty was standing, was marked by a deep hole caused by the explosion.</p>
<p>The Huns having got the range there was nothing else to do but to get out of the remains of that trench as soon as possible &amp; report to the officer in charge.</p>
<p>The men left in three parties with about 25 yards interval.<br/>From the trench for about 20 or 25 yards was a slight incline or rise &amp; to get up the slippery surface quickly each party ran but when level ground was reached started walking.</p>
<p>They had not gone more than 60 or 70 yards when a shell burst between the first &amp; second parties &amp; another between the second &amp; third. If the men had continued running the shells would have probably "got" the second &amp; third pairs. Under these conditions an interval of 100 yards between the parties was allowed and although again two shells burst as before but did no damage. Of course these shells were taken to be just portion of those sent over in the general bombardment &amp; falling where they did was merely a coincidence, &amp; not specially aimed. The "down" timber through which they were travelling no doubt smothered the flying splinters &amp; protected the men walking out.</p>
<p>On reaching Coy Headquarters a message was sent to Capt of B Coy reporting both posts as having been blown in &amp; instructions were awaited.</p>
