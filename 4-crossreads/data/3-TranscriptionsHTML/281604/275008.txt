<p>3rd year on service<br/> Aug <br/>My third year on active service had rather a bright opening for I was well set in a very comfortable cubicle in "C Coy 1st T.B. No 8 Camp Warrington" on the instructional staff. Things were very quiet in the camp but we were able to cause a little excitement in the corporals mess of a night &amp; by going on leave of a night or weekends to Salisbury.<br/> Sept <br/>I was granted my 10 days furlough starting from the 17th but I obtained leave to Salisbury on Sunday 16th with my pass to start leave the next morning. I arrived at Waterloo Stn London about midday on the 17th &amp; had a good time the rest of the day &amp; night in London. Next day the 18th I left London via Victoria Stn for Brighton by 1.55 train arriving at Brighton about 3 PM &amp; from that day till eight days time had a real good holiday but on the 22nd I accompanied by a friend went via motor to Eastbourne which is smaller than Brighton but a very pretty place &amp; has a fine pier.</p>
