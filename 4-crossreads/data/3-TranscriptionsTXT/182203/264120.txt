I really am sorry that I have not sent p.c.'s to all my friends this year but On Active Service in France is very different to Cairo. One cannot buy any cards, & papers unless you walk miles & then very poor quality. Also I'm afraid I've got lazy. I shall try & write a few lines to them some future day. Fondest love & kisses to you all & hope you will have good-luck. Fancy T.R's. paying a   Div   Hope will repeat the dose. Send me summer weight long-sleeves combinations (wool) about three pairs please. Must wear wool here & find it hard to get.From,                                                                                                                                                                           Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                         Edith.
