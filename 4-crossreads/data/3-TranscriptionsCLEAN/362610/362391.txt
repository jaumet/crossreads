  
 Saturday 24 June 1916 An artillery straff in the night which was misty & awfully wet underfoot. The morning was fairly clear but more rain fell later, then giving place to a bright sunny day. Everything underfoot was still fearfully wet & slushy. About 3 o'c. in the afternoon a heavy bombardment, the severest we had during our term in the trenches, was opened up on the company next to us, & just as it was past its climax Rid & Leo came along. They got thro' safely was I felt a little sorry that they had come because the bombardment was so heavy that I was afraid it might develop into a serious attack. They left as soon as the shelling ceased, the evening then being beautifully calm & peaceful. At night the 4th Bn. relieved us & we went back into "close supports". It was an anxious walk back thro' the communication trenches, but all went well & we were in our quarters by 12.30.
