One rest, feeling sick with the stench I found they had lowered the stretcher on top of a big dead German. After being fixed up by Dr Craig stretcher bearers carried us to different dressing stations. Changed from horse ambulance to motor and so on until at Warmoy my old friend Dr Drummond probed the wound and said bone was touched and operation would be necessary Gave morphin and then motor ambulance again to Puche Villiers where beds are provided. Andrew and others here and left for England, doctors kept me.

Enjoyed my first sleep for some days they [indecipherable] and washed me. This hospital is very comfortable. Went on by hospital train to English hospital at Etaples. The train was most luxurious and comfortable. Spent a bad night with great pain.
