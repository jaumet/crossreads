9/4/17
A wet inclement morning with a flake or two of snow. Practiced a Battalion attack in the morning and carried it out in the afternoon at Tara Hill under the eye of the General. Adjourned to 21st Mess for some afternoon tea and then to a prosy lecture by Colonel Bridges on Ad Guards. Did not reach home till late and had as busy an evening as the day was. The last few days have been quite strenuous enough for anyone.
