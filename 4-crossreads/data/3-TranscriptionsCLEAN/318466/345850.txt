Monday 9 December 1918Left Vancouver at noon & had a quiet passage round to Victoria.  Left there at 8 p.m. for Honolulu.  Played Bridge with Rup & a couple of fellows.
Tuesday 10 December 1918From here until Thursday morning I lose all interest in the proceedings!!!  Am sick as old Harry.
Wednesday 11 December 1918Who called it "Pacific"!!!  Rup's all serene!
Thursday 12 December 1918Strolled round deck this morng. - feeling & looking like nothing on earth.  Reckon "Niagara" is a rotten ship.  She rolls all over the place.
Friday 13 December 1918Left Breakfast hurriedly but recovered afterwards!  Finding my sea legs but it's a hard job on this awful ship!!
Saturday 14 December 1918Reach calmer water at last but the confounded ship still rolls.  Getting warmer.  Tried my hand at Deck Tennis.Who called it the "Pacific" Ocean.
