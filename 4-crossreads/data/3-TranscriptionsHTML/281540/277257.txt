<p>7/11/15<br/>seen here.  Passed men carrying cakes &amp; strings of figs from YMCA canteens.  The beach the usual hive of industry  Wounded &amp; sick lying near new pier waiting to be taken off by the hospital launch.  Maltese &amp; Egyptian labourers about and not a few Greeks.  Some big "goolahs" lying in a heap.  At YMCA canteen crowds waiting in an orderly queue controlled by MP's<br/>On return heavy shelling from 75's to which our batteries replied.</p>

<p>1924  Damn Turks can be heard at their entanglements again snicking and hammering.  We are putting in some rapid and some machine gun fire.</p>
<p>8/11/15<br/>Dawn disclosed 20 yards more barbed wire pushed out by Abdul.  <br/>Very chilly and sharp morning succeeded by lovely warm sunny day but very cold in the shade.  The sea very calm.  Nothing much doing.  At lunch a good search from secret post disclosed only an odd mule whisking round corner of track otherwise very quiet in enemy lines.  We attacked last night on right and gained objective with small loss.  Lone Pine also pushing on to enemy workings and their tunnel yesterday disclosed 12 very dead and buried Turks who had to be carted away piecemeal and reburied.</p>
<p>21st Batt did the "right close' which relieved the strain on us.  Bombs &amp; m.g's quieter tonight.  An old bad egg up again some time since in the person of our</p>
