Thistlethwaite was a trainee in the Melbourne Hospital, and worked under me as a nurse on several occasions, when I was a Sister in the Institution  Her work as a nurse was exceedingly good. She was observant, and careful of detail, and showed tact in the management of her patients. Her general deportment was always good.
