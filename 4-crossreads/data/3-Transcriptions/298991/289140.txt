<p>Monday February 5th<br/>The 13th Batt are still holding what they took last night. Two counter attacks were beaten off. The 13th Field Ambulance also lost fairly heavy.<br/>The improvements added to the "receiving point" are greatly appreciated by all. Not so cold today, snow still on ground, but it is gradually thawing.</p>
<p>Tuesday February 6th<br/>A terrible windy day. Very strong &amp; cold direct northerly wind blowing. We never started work until 2 pm as we are again changing over from day shift to night shift. Had a terrible head ache this afternoon &amp; after Captain Furber examined me, he ordered me back to bed, also gave me some medicine. Very bilious during the night, which necessitated my getting up three times &amp; my word it was a very very very cold wind blowing, very strong too.</p>
<p>Wednesday February 7th<br/>As this place has been altered to a Divisional rest station &amp; M.D.S. we don't get half the patients we previously got. Cold wind still blowing a gale today. Our tent was nearly blown away. Not felling so bad today. Have rather a bad cough though.</p>
<p>Thursday February 8th<br/>Received four letters by todays mail. Still very windy &amp; cold. Things are very quiet here now. We have a good few patients through here with trench feet, pleurisy, Bronchitis etc. Fritz keeps coming over this way every night in his airoplane. He was flying very low last night, &amp; fired a good few shots out of his machine gun on a road about three hundred yards away from here, but there was nothing there at the time. <strike>He was fly</strike><br/>500 is the principal card game in the tent, to pass time away.</p>
