  
 Red Cross letterhead. Bulford 19.6.17 Dear Dad, Mum & George, We received a couple of Letters from You this week dated 29.4.17.  They are the first for a long time.  I suppose all the others have been fishes food. Talking of sports, I went to Lark Hill to run in the 100 yard A.I.F. Championship but was outclassed & only got 2nd or 3rd in My Heat.  All the Pro's were there & there were three beauties who won as they liked.  I ran well enough but these coves have been at the game for years & run against Postle & Donaldson & Co.  It was an awful hot day & we motored from Bulford to the Sports but had to walk back about 4 1/2 miles.  Gee the heat here is more oppressive
