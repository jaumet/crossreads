<p>May 1915<br/>Tuesday 4<br/><u>Fine</u> with cool wind.<br/>Misfortune seems to be following our Reg. Our Col. (Braund]) was shot dead last night about 1.30 PM. With a bullet through the head, it is beleived by a stray bullet. Both the enemies guns &amp; ours are very quiet. More reinforcements are coming for us today. Our Hydroplane is doing his tour of inspection over the battle field. Letters from home again. Received a beautiful mouth organ from Clare.</p>
<p>Wednesday 5<br/>Cloudy.  Moved into the firing line again on the right of our position. Splendid sheltered trenches. The Turks gave us no trouble except to give us a shot at the trench occasionally. It was cold towards dusk. Our artillery had a turn at them about 7 P.M. and shook them up a bit. We watch the enemy through periscopes.</p>
