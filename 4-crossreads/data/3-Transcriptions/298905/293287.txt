<p>sides of us, I'll bet they are beginning to wish they had never started the war<br/>From where I am writing this there is very pretty scene, on my right the road stretches for nearly a mile in a straight line, &amp; on one side it is bordered by pretty trees, all of an even size, the other side is nothing but beautiful growing crops of all sorts of things, &amp; bonzer hedge's &amp; every here &amp; there an old &amp; picturesque farmhouse nestles among the trees, &amp; growing all over the old house's are fine old grape vines, &amp; they flourish amazingly well &amp; are loaded with beautiful grape's, France is famed &amp; rightly so for her grape's, for she has the goods alright. On my left, the trees are also bordering the road &amp; they run right into the now almost ruined Fleurbaix, once a most beautiful village but now</p>
