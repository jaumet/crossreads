<p>Some Gift stuff for the men given out. It would add value to every article if <u>some one's name was on it</u> - as the idea that it is a personal gift appeals to all ranks as much as the value.</p>
<p>Heavy Dust storm last night &ndash; I must be getting nervy &ndash; Coz, a cricket walked over my face &amp; I sprang 2 ft. out of my Blankets &ndash; thinking it was a SCORPION. At one HUT yesterday I found 20 Cisterns or SILOS about 12 ft. deep 6' wide &amp; a manhole to enter. These Holes are used to store the grain in, it seems to keep all right. I wonder how it would work in our country.</p>
