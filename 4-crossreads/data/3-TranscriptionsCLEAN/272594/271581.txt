This evening I had to scratch a hasty inlying piquet together it was supposed to be 34 strong but try as I would 30 was all I could muster so I marched them down, thinking that there would be a fine row, but as luck had it the officer never counted them, so I marched them back to the lines quick & lively.
It has been fairly cold today a piercing wind has been blowing across the plains
