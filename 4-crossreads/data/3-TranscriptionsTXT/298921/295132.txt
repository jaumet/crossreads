 June, 1915 Thursday 10 My recommendation for Captain has gone in today &ndash; The Colonel tells me I will get the rank, but not the pay at present, however, the Rank is something &ndash; it means 3 stars I have 3 Court Martials running at the present time, all Reinforcements &ndash; just arrived &ndash; The 6th Brigade of Infantry are here &amp; I am told that Jack Lorimer is among them but at present Quarantined at Suez &ndash; the whole boatload &ndash; I expect Harry Phillips will turn up soon, but one  never  looks for people among soldiers like needles in Hay Stacks.
