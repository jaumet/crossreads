 Thursday 30 March 1916 [The following sentence crossed through.]  Regiment cleaning up Camp.  Col. Fuller &amp;amp; Major Foster left today. 
 Regiment returned from Outpost duty on the Canal.  Major Bruxner took lunch with us.  Water carts which left here early this morning to supply the needs of the men who had no water during this march across the desert from Tel el Kebir returned to Camp.  They say the men were famished, &amp;amp; some  9 died of thirst. The man who ordered the march was counted out in the presence of the Prince of Wales &amp;amp; hooted.  An inquiry is to be held.
