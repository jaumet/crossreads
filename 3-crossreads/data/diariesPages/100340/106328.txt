a good spell out of the line must not grumble at being sent up again. Have never heard whether you got my photo off Laurel but I suppose she would not forget to send you one. I mean the big photo taken in London not that little snap I sent you some few weeks back. Well dear Sis will close now so give my love to Vol also a big kiss for Noni. Say, can she say Uncle Hal yet. Oh well ta-ta- Sis fondest love from your brother Hal.
