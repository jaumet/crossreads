<p>My dear Judge,</p>
<p>How many times I have changed my address since arriving in this country I'm sure I don't know.  At present I am attached to Hdgrs. Desert Mtd. Corps &ndash; for how long I don't know.  I was with the 4th L.H.F.A. for two weeks &ndash; that was also only a temporary job &ndash; and it was from there that I went down with dysentery.  I had a week on L of C [Line (s) of Communication] &ndash; nearly a week in hospital in Cairo and then 9 days in Alex at a Convalescent home.  From there I came straight up the line and dropped into my present job.  It is simply an R.M.O's [Regimental Medical Officer] job with the Hdgrs. Camp &ndash; not at all onerous &amp; carrying with it the usual comparative luxury associated with a Corps Hdqrs.</p>
<p>I must before going further, acknowledge a letter which I received from you some days ago.  It had been waiting for me for some time with the Anzac Signal Squadron.  I was very pleased indeed to get it &amp; must thank you for the enclosed cable forms.  I had not used any previously as I was not sure that they would be accepted by the officer in Alex or Cairo.  But I will use them now and am very thankful to you for going to so much trouble to make arrangements &amp; let me have the forms.</p>
<p>I am afraid there's not much that's worth cabling about, happening to me but I'll just let you know, from time to time, that I am still in the land of the living.  At the same time as I had your letter</p>
