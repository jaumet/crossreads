<p>Friday Oct 16th<br/>We arrived at Suva about 1 pm yesterday <u>15th</u>  -  From quite early in the morning heavy tropical rain fell &amp; with interruptions it has continued to the present  -  It looks like an early rainy season  -  We followed our leader --The Encounter   -  &amp; anchored by our old friend the Sydney  -  The fleet lay all around us &amp; the big Frenchman   -  the Montcalm &ndash; with his guns stuck out was there too  -  Shortly after we anchored AE2 came alongside &amp; then we found that she had lost a blade from her starboard propeller &amp; at once preparations were started to put a new propeller on &amp; remove the old one  -  All was well we heard  -  Tahiti had been shelled by the Germans &amp; the cable at Fanning Island destroyed  -  We had heard a rumor of this before  -  The bombardment of defenceless Tahiti was loudly condemned on all hands  -  Pure savagery to bombard such a beautiful spot  -  There's a paper here - the Fiji Times - we got news from that  -</p>
