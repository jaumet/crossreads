And the fierce thirst, and the strong pain.3Forget? God smiles to see them merryFor his own son was once a boyThey never shall be old and wearyBut of their youth shall have great joyBut in the playing fields of heavenShall run and leap new washed new shriven4Now heaven by golden boys invadedScaped from the winters and the stormStainless and simple as he made itGod keeps the boy's heart out of harmThe wise old saints look down and smileThey are so young and without guile
