My dear Judge,The figures on attached may be of interest to you. They are accurate as far as I can ascertain from our official Records Section as regards admissions etc but the average strength & total numbers through the country, are merely rough guesses on my part.
I should think the admission rate for sickness is higher than that in France - considerably.
Malaria has of course been largely responsible for our casualties. In the Anzac Division alone there were 5285 evacuations with Malaria during 1918 and the Australian Division and Camel Corps & other units were subjected to it to the same extent.
We are all waiting developments - authority is through for repatriation at full speed ahead - as fast as boats are available so we should not be long now.
With kindest regards
Yours very sincerelyR.J. Hunter
