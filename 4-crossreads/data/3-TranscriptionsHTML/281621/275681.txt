<p>Wednesday 17<br/>This morning we found the ground covered to a depth of four inches or more with snow and we had much enjoyment snowballing. This afternoon we all turned out on a hare hunt over the hills at the back and after an hours best of fun we got one hare. Many managed to get through our cordon.</p>
<p>Thursday 18<br/>Still snowing. We had another hunt this afternoon with same results as yesterday.</p>
<p>Saturday 20<br/>The ground is still white with snow. It is rumoured that we move soon to a [indecipherable] sector of this front.</p>
