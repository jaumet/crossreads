<p>6:  Turks shelled our camps from Oghratina throughout the night putting a couple through our hospital rents.  A mountain battery &amp;200 prisoners brought in today.  Things very quiet today &amp; no doubt the enemy is getting well away with his guns &amp; supplies; whilst we are here instead of chasing them on our mounts.</p>
<p>7:  Left Romani 3 a.m. pushing on to Oghratina getting into action once more.  Taubes bombed our redoubts at Romani killing 15 Tommies.  Our planes heavily bombed the retreating enemy, whilst we just annoyed them from the ridges. At 9 p.m. we were again withdrawn much to our surprise, as it gave the enemy a chance to form another line at Bin el Abd.  Men &amp; horses were played out when we reached Romani.</p>
<p>8:  Left Romani 2 p.m., reaching Katia 5 p.m., camping here for the night.</p>
<p>9:  Left Katia 4 a.m., pushing on to Abd, again coming in contact with the enemy.  This was hot, as Abdul had put up a strong force to meet our attack.  N.Z. gun section chopped an enemy charge to pieces, but we had heavy casualties &amp; carrying wounded about &frac12; mile through the heavy sand.  Four shells landed among our artillery, killing 4, wounding 8 men &amp; 30 horses.  Just as we had</p>
