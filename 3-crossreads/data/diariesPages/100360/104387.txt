Friday June 1st Went the Milk round with Anvil. Saw quite a lot of folks who knew me. Went to Pat Astbury’s. Had a great old yarn with her. She made me stay & have some Dinner. Then she sewed some buttons on my pants. Paid a visit to Mrs Morris. She made a great fuss of me & gave me a Box of Cigarettes before leaving. Met Freddy down the Town. He is just the same as ever. Met Freakley & Mr Swift. They don’t seem to be altered much.
