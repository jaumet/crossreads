<p>-2- 8th October 1915.</p>
<p>quently only a day old are posted up, at the entrance to the trenches and the news of late has been most gratifying.  Any Australian news we get is always over a month old, and beyond our own little sphere of ground we know very little as to what is going on on the Peninsular.</p>
<p>Mails here are fairly frequent now, but so far I have not received a paper or parcel.</p>
<p>Glad to hear Os has joined up, though can't quite understand his idea of joining the Light Horse.  Of course he knows he will have to come over here as Infantry and believe me he will want all the hard training he can get for this sort of business.  It takes a bit of getting used to.</p>
<p>Life here is not so bad considering and it certainly has the added zest of risk.  A great trouble here is the live stock, which dispute with us most heartily as to who is going to have possession of our dugout, and otherwise we are pretty comfortable.</p>
<p>Hope everything and everybody at the Office is O.K. and that you are keeping a good supply of news coming this way.</p>
<p>Your affectionate Son,<br/>Pte 1280 Roy Richards.</p>
<p>I am enclosing you a little piece of poetry composed by a Signaller in the 8th Batt.  I thought it was rather good.</p>
