<p>2 small tins of jam, &amp; 1 tin of butter.  2 tins of Pork &amp; Beans enough only for 4 men for 1 meal, and 1 tin of Army Rations (meat &amp; vegetables cold) sufficing 4 men for 1 meal.  Hence there was only really enough for 1 meal all round, therefore, of the 5 meals, we missed four.  How ever did we lift a stretcher?  We were glad to get a sleep too on arriving at Green Dump because we had none last night.</p>
