  
 Towards dusk we came into touch with Turkish cavalry but they did not appear to care to engage us at close quarters, two of our batteries opened fire on them as they retired just at dusk. Out attack on the flank was merely a demonstration in force to assist the British Infantry which all day have been attacking the strong Turkish fortifications around Gaza. We hear that the Infantry were successful in taking some of the main defences around Gaza & in making an appreciable advance.
