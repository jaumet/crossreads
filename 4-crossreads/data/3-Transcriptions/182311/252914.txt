<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr &amp; Mrs. Clark had both been vey good to me, to say thank you I arranged a nice little dinner at Frascatis, then to the theatre to Chu-Chin-Chow, Oscar Asche&#39;&#39;s scenic opera which is now in its third year of continuous perfor-mances.&nbsp; It was splendid and after a very enjoyable evening I parted from my friends, went back to the Club, slept, rose early, caught the 7-35 a.m. train for Folkeston had a calm enjoyable crossing and by 12-30 found myself again in France, at Boulougne.&nbsp; I spent the afternoon at a seaside suburb (Wimereaux) retired early after writing a few letters, then rising early caught the 7-47 train to the station that is nearest to the battalion, then an eight kilo walk and I was home, I walked into the mess, all were at dinner, and a yell of welcome arose, soon I was telling my story, answering enquiries as to the wounded whoom I had met and in between, eating my meal.&nbsp; It was a different battalion that I found, the 37th had been amalgamated with us in my absence and formed two companies A &amp; C, while my Coy &quot;C&quot; had been absorbed in &quot;D&quot; Coy and our old A.&amp;.B.Coy combined into a new &quot;C&quot;.&nbsp; As junior Captain I am second-in-Command of &quot;D&quot; Coy, the O/C being Capt.Bill Orchard M.C., the Geelong footballer.&nbsp; The other officers, Lieuts Bowman, Eason, Rowe and Jacky Davis a jolly good team it is too.&nbsp; With all this added seniority from the 37th Bn.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know what to think about my Captaincy; I hope to retain it and there is a possibility of it being made permanent, <sub>^</sub><sup>(Later - it was)</sup> I hope so for it is rotten to feel that if you are hit or go away sick,</p>
