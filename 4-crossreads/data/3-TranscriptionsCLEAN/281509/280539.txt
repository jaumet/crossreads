  
 12 November 1916 Sunday 
 Another Sunday under shell fire! What would we give for a quiet peace of a Sunday morning at home to the strain & turmoil of this hell. Helped carry a Brig. General down this morning. Fuss, & 2 squads employed, sup o rfluous Fairly quiet day. Fritz tunes up toward evening & & there in a violent bombardment on both sides. We anticipated some work tonight. By a marvellous dispensation there was hardly a casualty.
