<p>This document outlines the general procedure for the demobilisation of the A.I.F. soldiers returning to Australia from the war in France.  It details the papers required for all aspects of moving men from camps in England to their departure from Devonport, England, on a transport vessel bound for Australia.</p>
<p>To lead up to my appointment to the Administrative Staff of No 3 Group, it is perhaps necessary to say something of the reinforcements waiting in England at the time of the Armistice, because in the case of the Third Divisional Group, it was largely from these men that the Camp Staff was drawn.</p>
<p>Upon the signing of the Armistice, it was apparently deemed advisable that pending further movements upon the part of both the enemy and the Allies, all drafts should be held in readiness only. Between that time and the latter end of January, men were either detailed or accepted voluntarily for Camp Staff duty in England for the period of demobilisation. It was afterwards found out that the estimate of the number required was somewhat short and much credit is due to men belonging to the very early quotas arriving from France who volunteered for the vacancies.</p>
<p>When it appeared certain that the chances of hostilities recommencing were nil, a genuine move towards the repatriation of the A.I.F. was begun. Just as each division had its training battalion for reinforcements in England, so each division was given a demobilisation centre, thus the following:-</p>
<p>1st Division-Lonbridge Deverill<br/>2nd Division-Sutton Veny<br/>3rd Division- Codford<br/>4th Division-Hurdcott<br/>5th Division- Weymouth.</p>
<p>All these camps were previously occupied by the A.I.F. as either Training battalions or Hospital bases, which only meant renaming them</p>
