<p>December 27, 28<br/>Two letters written and posted:  to Aunt Louie &amp; asking for Moore's "Story Teller's Holiday" and to Mrs. H. my thanks for the book parcel.</p>
<p>Commenced, and half completed, a drawing of the Solre Hotel de Ville and Tower, for "Aussy".</p>
<p>December 28<br/>12.<br/>A mood of blasphemous fed-upness:  Mick was to have been paraded by Morell to the G.O.C. at 12.30:  instead he refuses the parade, threatens all the Military's wrath, and sends to the draft in Mick's place, Kerr's batman!  Indispensable:  in face of General Monash's Corps order that no man is indispensable &ndash; in the face of G.S.O. [General Staff Officer] III, Capt. Laughlin &ndash; leaving for Aust. H.Q. in the middle of a stunt in September, from the Bois de Buire!</p>
<p>Who is Morell &ndash; C.C. Boyd? &ndash; and his brother, C. Morell of the Pioneers late 1917 becomes a Staff Trainee.</p>
<p>Thank God the warr is over!</p>
<p>Out alone this afternoon in the blowing rain along the drear dirty roads.</p>
<p>13.<br/>A Dream of a great sombre Tapestry hung hall, strangely entered from the porchway of a poor villiage church:  in the small graveyard about were broken flung down vaults as at St. Souplet.</p>
