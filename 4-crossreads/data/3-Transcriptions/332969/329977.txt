<p>our Platoon with Leut Westbrook went out boating over to see the Queen Elizebeth.</p>
<p>Saturday 24.4.15  still on boat</p>
<p>Sunday 25.4.15    About 6 am we got into Destroyers &amp; were taken some distance towards the shore &amp; then got into life boats &amp; were tugged towards the shore with small tug boats then we had to row the rest of the way. I can tell you it was a very exciting time shells were flying every where &amp; some of them were splashing the water over us its a wonder to me that any of us are left to tell the tale.  As the shrapnel was whistling all round us &amp; one of the boys sitting next to me got hit in the thumb. when we rowed close enough to be Beach the officer gave the order to jump out &amp; make for the shore. I made a jump out and found myself in about 3 ft of water. anyway it did not take me very long to reach the sandy beach &amp; I can tell you. I was not last in arriving there we had to run over the sandy beach &amp; get under cover for the shells we busting all round us &amp; plenty of my mates only a few feet away</p>
