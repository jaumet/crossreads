2/2/19 Gourdinne
Working away on historical stuff all this Sunday morning and then after lunch took a walk to Somzee and then back by a cross country track. All is covered inches deep in snow and yet life is very active. Everywhere on the snow are the prints of bird's feet and the pad marks of animal's hooves. The afternoon's become lowering and dull fairly early and a sort of haze steely white seems to settle down early. The village compact with snowcovered rooves looks cosy and comfortable. No wonder the people keep close indoors this weather and take no exercise ? there are few inducements to outdoor life. Evening had a family party at Madame Crochelets and talked, joked and ate a tart.
