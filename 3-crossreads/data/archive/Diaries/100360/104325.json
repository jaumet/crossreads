Sept. 22.  Misty but fine.  Fritz tried very hard to knock our Pill Box in --- but am jolly glad to say he failed.  He put 2 shells right on top, but it only shook ?em off &amp; we are still going strong.  A good few wounded came through &amp; we were kept busy.  We had Breakfast as well as possible under the circs. About 8 a.m. the  1st F. Amb. came to relieve us &amp; never were they more welcome, as things were getting most uncomfortable around our Pill Box.  We marched back along the Menin Road to our A.C.S. where we got aboard motor Lorries &amp; returned to our H.Q, at Poperinghe.  It was a very pleasant surprise to go back &amp; we greatly appreciated the good dinner that awaited us.  We also had a hot shower &amp; clean change of clothes.  After Tea we had an Investiture of the Bottes.</p> \r\n <p>Sun. Sept. 23.  Woke up this morning feeling refreshed after a  good night's sleep &amp; the Bath.  Had Break. at 7.  Fell in at 8 &amp; came away in motor lorries to Ypres, where we now are awaiting orders.  Yesterday I got   <strike>a</strike>\u00a0Letters from Mrs Ibbs &amp; Ruth, containing that postcard of M.S. which I was so anxious to get.  As we passed along in the Lorries we met a number of Belgians on their way to Church. It struck me ? what a contrast.  They were on their way to a Peaceful gathering, &amp; we were on our way to join in the bloomin? argument with Fritz. We are camped in a big dug-out, which is built near the Town Square.  The entrances are cut through what was once the city walls.  It is about 6ft thick &amp; built of brick.  It has accommodation for about 1000 men.  Bricky &amp; I took a stroll round the town, but as Fritz was sending over a few souvs. we returned.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300133\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 133]<br> \r\n Mon. Sept. 24.  Reveille at 6 Break. at 7.   A sec. went into the Line last night.  B sec. went to the A.C.S. along the Menin Rd. &amp; did Fatigues.  Collecting Petrol Tins &amp; burning them out for water.  It was a glorious day &amp; there were hundreds of planes about.  We had dinner about 1 oclock &amp; after a spell resumed the \"cleaning up\" operations.  C section came out to us, but were sent out to the Line with Blankets &amp; stretchers.  Fritz put a number of shells over near us, but none of us were hit.  Some of our crowd were carting away the clothes of Gassed Patients &amp; Bricky is loaded with souvenirs.  They say the stunt is not coming off till Wed. morning.  We returned to our quarters in the redoubt about 6.30 &amp; found that B sec of the 15th were all down with diarrhoea.</p> \r\n <p>Menin Road</p> \r\n <p>Tues. Sept. 25.  Turned out at 4.  Break at 5.  Then we went out to the A.C.S. along the Menin Rd.  We left for the Line about 6.  The road was teeming with Traffic &amp; looking straight down the road was one of Fritzs Balloons.  An A.A. Gun was passing along  &amp; we were going in single file down past it, when a shell lobbed right alongside it.  When the smoke cleared away we picked up poor old Phil Murray.  He was riddled with shrapnel &amp; was just alive, but he died just as he reached the dressing station.  McGoldrick got a knock in the back, &amp; Mole got one in the arm.  Dickson was also wounded.  It's a wonder they were not all killed.  After a little delay we resumed our Journey.  I must say that most of us \"had the wind up\".  Fritz put a few more shells in the road as we passed along, blowing up 5 motor lorries &amp; a number of horses, but very few men were hit which was very remarkable.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300134\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 134]<br> \r\n Menin Road<br> \r\n Tues. Sept. 25 (cont)  We got out to Hooge Tunnel without further loss.  The motor lorries were all ablaze, &amp; we got past them at the \"toots\" as they were such a good mark for Fritz. &amp; he put his \"big stuff\" over thick &amp; heavy.  There were plenty of wounded coming thro &amp; we were kept busy.  Just near where poor Phil got knocked was \"Hell Fire Corner\" &amp; never was a place better named.  We had to carry about 1\u00bd miles to the A.D.S. past the burning lorries &amp; to add to the excitement, a dump caught fire, &amp; Mills Bombs &amp; cartridges were banging away in all directions.  Bullecourt  was bad enough, but it was a \"Home\" compared to this sport.  One of our squads composed of Bill Hippersley, Lew Ballard, Mat Doyle, &amp; Henry Mercer, got about 50 yds away from out dug out with a Patient, when a shell dropped among them.  It blew poor old Mat &amp; Lew &amp; the patient to pieces, </p> \r\n <p> Hooge Tunnel &amp; Crater  </p> \r\n <p>blew one of Henry's legs off, &amp; slightly injured Bill Hippersley.  Poor old Mercer died soon after reaching the dressing station.  Soon after this \"Towny\" got his right hand badly smashed.  </p> \r\n <p>Our list of casualties was getting very high.  It was a great relief to get back to our Tunnel as it was very strongly built &amp; one felt fairly safe inside it.  It was built by the Germans &amp; runs along for about 5 miles.  Fritz used to bring his troops along it at one time.  In places it is blown in, &amp; now forms a series of very serviceable dug-outs.  Owing to so many casualties we had plenty of rations.  Wyn Arthur was the next to get a \"souvenir\" from Fritz.  A small piece of shrapnel hit him in the shoulder.  It was not serious &amp; after they had dressed him at the A.D.S. [Advanced Dressing Station] they sent him back to duty, as we were so short of men.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300135\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 135]<br> \r\n Tues. Sept. 25 (cont)  I took his place with A. Butler, B. W. Howard &amp; Ralph Watts.  Just after he returned, Arthur Butler made a casualty of himself by drinking about \u00bd  a pint of kerosene in mistake for water, so I still continued to carry with the squad, Wyn taking Arthur's place.  During the day Sgt Mathieson took a number of squads &amp; formed a relay post, down at the crater.  This improved matters a lot, as it halved the distance we had to carry.  The 60th Batt. went into the Line at midday &amp; we got a few of them through.  Fritz kept shelling heavily &amp; we were kept busy.  We were \"No 7\" squad, &amp; the Figure 7 will linger long in my memory.  At night a bright moon shone, &amp; made things good for us, as it is terrible to carry over shell riddled ground in the dark.</p> \r\n <p>The 54th &amp; 56 Batt. went up during the night.  They were sitting along the road as we passed by with a stretched case.  A shell burst among them, killing &amp; wounding quite a number including a M.O. &amp; an officer.  Ted Grey, Eli Dodson &amp; a number of others came along to give us a hand.  Things got a bit quiet &amp; we had a spell of about 2 hours.  </p> \r\n <p>At about 5 on Wed. SEPT 26  we got another carry.  Things were very rough &amp; shells were bursting in all directions.  We arrived at Hooge Crater safely, but found that it was badly knocked about.  A number of dug-outs had been blown in &amp; quite a lot of dead were lying about.  Ralph Watts &amp; I were just lifting our Patient into the Y.M.C.A, canteen when a shell burst right behind us.  I got a bit of it in my thigh &amp; a chap named West 1745. A. Coy. 31 Batt. who came down with us as a walking case, got a crack on the Jaw.  He was already wounded in the chest.     </p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300136\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 136]<br> \r\n Wed. Sept. 26 (cont)  Ralph also got a piece in his leg, but it only grazed the skin.  He fixed up my leg &amp; also put a bandage on Westy.  As soon as things got a bit quiet I hobbled along to the D.S. on the Menin Road.  In the excitement I took the wrong turning &amp; wandered through the wood, where a lot of our big guns were.  Just as I was hit our barrage started.  It was a beauty, &amp; very quickly silenced Fritz's Guns.  On my way to the D.S. I met a couple of other chaps slightly wounded, &amp; we got aboard the first car we met &amp; went to the M.D.S. [Main Dressing Station]  Here I saw Sgt. Seymour &amp; Maj. North dressed my wound.  From here we went by motor lorry to the Can C.C.S.  Our crowd were at the D.R.S. [Divisional Rest Centre] opposite &amp; very soon came to see me.  Maj. Wooster, Mac, Brian Aspinall  &amp; a whole crowd of ?em.  Bill Gamble brought me Tobacco & Cigarettes.<br> \r\n IN HOSPITAL<br> \r\n At the C.C.S. they gave us Porridge, Biscuits &amp; Cocoa.  Then we were put aboard the Hosp. Train &amp; brought to No 22. Gen. Hosp. Camieres  Here we changed our clothes &amp; had a Hot Bath, which was most refreshing.  I was very soon asleep, &amp; did not wake up till the Orderly brought round Break. on THURS. 27  <br> \r\n Am in A 10 Ward.  It is a big marquee &amp; has 60 Beds.  It is an American Hospital &amp; the nurses &amp; staff look after us well.  We had Porridge, with plenty of milk, but no sugar, bread &amp; Butter &amp; Tea.  At 10 the Doctor came round.  He marked me for X Ray.  I went down after dinner, but they were too busy, so I'll have to wait till tomorrow.  After Tea the Yanks played Baseball.  It was quiet thrilling to watch.  Wrote Letter 35 to B.E. also wrote to Mother &amp; sent whizz-bangs to Ruth &amp; Mrs Sam.     </p> \r\n <p>[Part of page obscured.
