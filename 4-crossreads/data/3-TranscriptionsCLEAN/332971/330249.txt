When we come in we see a list up of all our names & of how we are to appear in England.  Matron adds that if anyone can't appear in proper uniform that they'll be put in a party of their own.
Yes, our stay in Egypt is drawing to a close.  The date for leaving fixed for the 22nd & we go by the "Karoola".  No 14th A.G.H. are taking our place here.  We have got it all so nice for them to step in to.
A party of 10 of us rose at 4.30 this a.m. & went on donks to the Mokattam hills to watch the sunrise.  It was beautiful.
Matron wanted us all to be photographed this afternoon & I have just come in from that trying ordeal.  A few weeks back I was keen on having a proper photo taken of myself in the uniform.  Thought of sending some of you one for Xmas.  I got as far as making an appointment paying a deposit & putting my cap on.  I gave a final look in the mirror & the photographer was all ready & came away.  Twas an off day I looked what I felt - old - and have never had the courage to go again.  Ma [indecipherable] photo.
Now I want to introduce Miss McConachy to you and a few of many that words could never tell what they have done for the Australian Mothers & their Soldier Sons.  Some day I may be able to tell of some of their goodness - these are their names, Rev & Mrs Gillan, Lady Rogers & Chetham - Mr & Mrs & Miss Gentles, Miss Ghryoeb & Miss McConachy -
