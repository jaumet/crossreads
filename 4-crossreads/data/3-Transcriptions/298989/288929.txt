<p>1/1/16<br/>sounding of bugles, blowing of the ships whistles and the cheering and singing of the men welcoming the New Year in. At 0015 lights out sounded and soon all was quiet. Heavy rain commenced about 0430 and dawn broke very cold and bleak. The harbour grey and foam-dashed full of craft, - some warships just making the entrance. Rain continuing after breakfast  the no parade was sounded.</p>
<p>A thing that strikes one both here and in Egypt is the absence of fences. For them is substituted the landmark, perhaps a rock, perhaps a furrow. To the outsider these boundaries are not apparent but do you trespass and the owners soon materialise!</p>
<p>After lunch went with Dr. Craig to 3rd. General Hospital to look up Drummond. Found him in isolation ward looking very bad with para-thyphoid. Lister let us in though visitors barred. Very muddy and cheerless place, the nurses wearing gumboots and putties. Their quarters are wooden huts, but lack privacy and the life is very rough for any girl. Canadian sisters in similar quarters sporty looking pieces. Anyway it is good to put eyes on a woman and let's hope next Saturday might well see us roaming out towards Mattarich or Le Caire with an armful of girl!</p>
<p>Our advance party left this morning. One is struck at a base like this at the hundreds of men building roadmaking &amp;c. Consider the hospitals &amp; the hundreds employed there. Money poured out on all sides. Elaborate cement platforms constructed all over these valleys for pail latrines. Discovery afterwards is made no pails available and then no timber.</p>
<p>Great football match A &amp; B v C &amp; D Coys resulted in win for the former. Rumours that the evacuation of Helles is now proceeding, that there are 300000 troops in Egypt, that we sail on Tuesday, that the Kaiser is dead, and that our pay is going to be reduced 1/3rd.  A goodly budget. Cold night slept well curled up in blanket on wet ground until awakened by reveille.</p>
