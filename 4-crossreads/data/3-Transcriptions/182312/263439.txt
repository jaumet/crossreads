<p>to travel go abroad hospital barges on the Somme.&nbsp; These barges</p>
<p>travel in sets of two escorted by a tug.&nbsp; Each barge is fittted up</p>
<p>as a complete hospital and has from 40 to 50 beds, two sisgers, a</p>
<p>staff of orderlies and a medical officer, the latter dividing his</p>
<p>time between the barges.&nbsp; The passage down the Somme to Abbeville</p>
<p>takes 24 hours various locks having to be negotiated on the way.</p>
<p>The barges are kept open to the&nbsp; sky in fine weather and as you pass</p>
<p>under bridges the towns folk assemble and drop flowers in on to you.</p>
<p>The sensation of having a bunch of wet roses dropped on to your face</p>
<p>from a height of about 50 feet, is anything but curative, but still</p>
<p>its &quot;well meant&quot;.&nbsp; We had an Australian sister on our barge, a</p>
<p>sister Timmins from Moree.&nbsp; I think she belonged to what in Egypt</p>
<p>was known as the 3rd. Australian General Hospital which disbanded on</p>
<p>coming to France with the result that the nurses are scattered about</p>
<p>France and England, mostly attached to British Hospitals, Hospital</p>
<p>Trains and Ships and clearing stations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.2 General Hospital - an English Hospital, not</p>
<p>Australian - at Abbeville is the best run institution I have met with.</p>
<p>The nurses, attendants, food and general comforts, were excellent.&nbsp; I</p>
<p>was there two days before boarding a Hospital train for Havre.&nbsp; These</p>
<p>trains are capable of carrying 600 to 700 wounded, each carriage</p>
<p>holding about 60, the bunks being arranged in three tiers.&nbsp; Like the</p>
<p>barges, the train is a complete hospital containing surgery, kitchens,</p>
<p>stores, quarters for nurses, doctors etc. and even an operating</p>
<p>theatre which of course is only used should circumstances make it</p>
<p>absolutely necessary that an operation should be performed.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>journey to Havre took about 17 hours and here, after a short wait on</p>
<p>the platform, we were put aboard the Hospital Ship &quot;Gloucester</p>
<p>Castle&quot; there to remain until the next day when another train arrived</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
