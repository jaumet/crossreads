 [Saturday 10 June 1916] 
 Camped at 10 AM (Saghia) &amp; tried to sleep till 9 at night when we saddled up for  Bayud - WATER is the trouble always &amp; we never get enough for man or beast on these stunts. Marched all night &amp; a Rocket was seen to be fired out in the Desert to alarm the Turks. Our objective was to surround a Turks Patrol &amp; destroy 16 of their Wells. The nights are beautiful but the days hell &amp; before we got home "We did a PERISH" but not as bad as the 6 &amp; 7th L.H. had.   We had an aeroplane so bombed their Camels-
