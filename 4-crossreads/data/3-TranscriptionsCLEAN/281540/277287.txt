  
 29/11/15 Rose at 0830 slept well and warm.  Still very cold and windy but not so bad as before.  Snow still about and all water pipes frozen.  Pools covered with ice an inch thick and stayed so all day.  Found mess filthy and no sign of breakfast.  Sat round brazier yarning until 1000 when bacon came along and we put it on the brazier & eat slices with fingers using big hunks of frozen bread.  The old padre who runs the mess has no control over servants who do as they like and leave the place filthy with food and dirty dishes.  Reason for breakfast fiasco said to be pipes being frozen and no water available. 
 Afterwards went to Greek canteen and had a penny cup of cocoa and then to seafront.  One big cargo steamer high and dry on the ground and swinging about big seas dashing right over, destroyer wrecked, pinnaces tugboats big lighters, the hospital "beetle" and other craft all ashore.  Thousands of pounds of damage.  Trawler T19 upside down.  Saw submarine in difficulties beating out through breakwater entrance.  Monitor and other warboats all snug.  Piers washed away and road much damaged.  Wind still very strong and the cold intense.  All my men comfortable.  Lunch the usual scrappy meal.  The Irish padre [indecipherable] & the rest of the heads left for Panaghia to make a night of it and will no doubt succeed  Six inches of snow across the road to there
