magnificent panorama of the battlefield. The way was gruesome awful beyond words. The ground had been recently heavily shelled by the Boche the dead and wounded lay about everywhere. About here the ground had the appearance of having been ploughed by a great canal excavator, then reploughed turned over and over again. Last nights shower too made it a quagmire; through this the wounded had to drag themselves, those mortally wounded pass out their young lives.
The shells shrieked in an ecstasy overhead, the deep boom of artillery sounded like a triumphant drum roll. Those murderous weapons the machine guns maintained their endless clatter, as if a million hands were encoring applauding the brilliant victory of our countrymen. It was ineffably grand terrible, yet one felt subconsciously safe in spite of the shell burst splinters the ungodly wanton carnage going on around.
