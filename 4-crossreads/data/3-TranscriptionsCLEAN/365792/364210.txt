  
 May 6 Rec'd 3 letters from England dated May 2 & 3rd. Uncle Jim sent on my cable to Mum so thats OK. 
 7 Rec'd another letter from England dated May 23nd. Another Aust came in last night. Believe the 20 Batt was cut up a bit by Artillery fire. Booked for the Base & expect to leave here tomorrow afternoon, possibly for Etaple. Cold & showery all day, gets on a fellows nerves. Believe there was Church but I was busy watching the promenaders and admiring the ladies. Had a hot-cold shower just the thing to buck a fellow up. [in margin] Sunday 
 8 Leaving here today, I am not sorry either. Will do a chap good to get out & stretch his legs. Tommy togs dished out to me, not a bad fit, but will be pleased to get our own at Base. Left Hosp at 2.30 per a 6 seater Car for the Base & arrived shortly after. Sleeping in bell tents on a wooden floor. Bit different to Hosp
