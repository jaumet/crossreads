<p>25 July 1918 Thursday<br/>Another night march to <strike>Deiran</strike> not far from our old camp in the <strike>Richon</strike> days.   Now all the country is changed as the Vineyards are full of ripe grapes-   Melons Cucumbers everywhere-   In the distance we can hear Jaffa being shelled &amp; enemy planes came &amp; had a look at us.<br/>I am still in command of the Regiment but of course we are doing nothing &amp; our C.O. is acting Brigadier.   My chief work now is to get my men mounted again &amp; horses shod up   It was bad luck losing so many.   Oil engines are puffing away watering the Vineyards-</p>
