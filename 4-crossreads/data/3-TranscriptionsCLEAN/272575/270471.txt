  
 It is growing Late and cold, and I have only a few more minutes before the mail closes. so I can say little more, will write again as soon as possible, and give you fuller details of our recent doings, but at present must be content with this.   I want it to go through for the Xmas mail, so will close now with, all Good wishes for Xmas and New Year to all Friends and Relatives and heaps of Love. and Good wishes to all at Home.   a special share for Yourself from Your Loving Son   Chas
