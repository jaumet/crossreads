Sun Mar 24th
Glorious day. The war news is of course the main topic for conversation.
Our Line has had to fall back a bit, but Fritz has had enormous losses.
It is rumoured that Paris is being bombarded, but it must be a new Gun Fritz has brought out.
Fritz certainly has Luck as far as the weather is concerned. In all our Big Pashs we have been blocked by rain. 
After dinner I went into Warminster and had Tea there and went to Church afterwards.
Com. Letter 14 to B.E.
Mon 25th
Germans re-capture Bapaume.
Perfect weather. We let the Fires out in the Mess as it was so warm.
"Darkey" finished up yesterday. The new Housekeeper is certainly making some changes in the Staff.
There is quite a lot in the paper about Fritz's new Gun. It dropped shells into Paris yesterday at intervals of 8 mins from a distance of 75 miles.
The Huns claim a big number of Prisoners and Guns, but he has to fight for every inch of the Ground. The Kaiser is in command.
Get new crockery in the Mess.
Finished Letter No 14 to M.S.
