Signals ? Gilbert Frankau
The hot wax drips from the flares
On the scrawled pink forms that litter
The bench where he sits: the glitter
Of stars is framed by the sandbags atop of the dugout stairs
And the lagging watch hands creep
And his cloaked mates murmur in sleep ?
Forms he can wake with a dick ?
And he hears as he plays with the pressel switch, the strapped receiver click,
On his ear that listens, listens,
And the candle-flicker glistens
On the rounded brass of the switchboard, where the red wires cluster thick.
Wires from the earth, from the air;
Wires that whisper and chatter
At night when the trench-rats patter
And nibble among the rations, and scatter back to their lair;
Wires that are never at rest,
For the linesmen tap them and test,
And ever they tremble with tone.
