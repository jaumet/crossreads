 Monday 24 April 1916 
 A fine day but not as clear &amp; bright as yesterday. Had rather a troublesome night &amp; abt. 10 o'c. set off to find a dentist &amp; made an appt. with him (a Canadian Capt.) for 2 p.m. Went on into town with Prescott &amp; the other officer who was with us (Moy) &amp; stayed with them transacting business for our Officers' Mess, &amp; then had lunch there with Prescott, having sardines, boiled fowl &amp; sauce, fried steak &amp; potatoes, tinned apricots &amp; tea for 3f. each. Had rather painful attention from the dentist who started to kill the nerves of a large back tooth, &amp; then went out to Paris Plage to get some photos left there, coming straight back by the same train. Not equal to any dinner &amp; glad to turn into bed. The blowing of "Retreat" altered to 7.15 p.m. showing how much the days are lengthening.
