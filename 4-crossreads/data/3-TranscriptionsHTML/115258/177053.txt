<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>Such a nice letter came from you a couple of days ago, with all the news of the old home in it. I&#39;m jolly glad that Kurrajong has grown so well. Some chaps over here tell me that you can transplant quite big trees of them, as long as you get their bulb, (you need not mind about the roots they say) and you want to cut all&nbsp;the branches off them and put a cake of mud on top of the stem to stop it cracking. I wrote to Hal a couple of days ago and addressed his letter home and he ought to be up for his holidays when it arrives. I also sent a Kia ora Cooee and a registered envelope of 17 photos taken on the last stunt. On&nbsp;Sunday evening I went to the Port Said English Church and they had a very nice service there. Sang Hymn 31 and I thought of our Sunday evening hymns at home. The church is truly eastern. It&#39;s roof is all small domes with one big one in the centre and I think it must have been a mosque once. It is painted [indecipherable] red and white streaks inside which is the dinkum Egyptian colouring, but it has a cross out side on top of the largest dome. I think I will take a photo of it one of these days. The white domes and the palm trees growing round</p>
