<p>Certainly there's any amount of growling but you can bet your life its not too bad at all, at all.</p>
<p>Got a cheery letter from Ede &amp; Phil the other day. They seem on a good wicket &amp; also mention that things are alright with you &amp; Al. I guess you're kept busy old man, but keep going. I hope to be a help to you when I get back, which may not be so long now Rumania is in. As for Al &amp; Ted give them my best love &amp; tell them I hope to be able to "do a bit" when I get back.</p>
<p>I wrote to Mrs Dye &amp; got a very kind invitation to Port Said, but owing to being <u>invited</u> on this stunt, I couldn't get there. I think Mrs Dye will have left for India ere this. She was due to leave about a month ago. I'm sorry as I would liked to have met them.</p>
<p>Give Clare my fondest regards also all the kiddies. My word they must be growing up. Hope Clare is absolutely OK. Also Alice. Got a letter from Vera Godkin. They all seem well. Lizzie is going well &amp; young Will's last photo showed him as a fine boy. They are in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Well old boss, more later. Paper very scarce just at present. Remember me to Bob and Bess Anderson will you also my old friends. Got a real splendid message from Jim Hebbard &amp; the Central chaps two mails ago.</p>
<p>Well old man you know the good things I wish you both adieu till we meet again</p>
<p>Your ever lovingly Will.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXX<br/>for Clare &amp; the Kiddies</p>
