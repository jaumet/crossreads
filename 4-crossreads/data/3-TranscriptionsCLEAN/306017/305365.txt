We got back to camp at Hassaniya at 7 am Monday & we were all glad to get back & have a decent sleep.  After 1 week in camp where we had an easy time our squadron went out in support duty for 48 hrs.  Our horses had a good time, we had plenty of feed & water & any quantity of dates.

 A canteen has been started both dry & wet.  It proved a great boon as we could get nearly anything we wanted.  Sergt Wilson of C Squadron who went in to buy the canteen stuff had very hard luck.  He fell under the train & got both legs cut off.  He was taken to the 31st Genl Hospl at Port Said.  I believe is likely to get on alright.  Sergt McNair also had a bad accident while in
