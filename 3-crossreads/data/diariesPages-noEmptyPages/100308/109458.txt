Bullecourt
Prisoners at 11 o.c amounted to 300 and stretchers full of wounded and moaning Germans passed repassed. Our patrols have been moving about No Mans Land not seriously molested. About 9 oc he sent a strong bombing attack against our left flank. We knocked out about 8 or 9 of them and their wounded are still in front of our lines. We had 1 killed 3 wounded. Shifted down to next Battn H.Q. about 11 am and understand from Stewart everything is on for tonight. Road in front of Battn office being shelled heavily. Major Dooley received a blighty in hand and shoulder. During lunch time many badly hit Germans were brought in by men specially detailed as S.B's. some groaning in the most ghastly manner shattered limbs and mangled bodies. Also got 5 men of ours who had been out 5 days a ghastly sight wounded limbs all swollen up. A carnival of pain and in hearing of the groans we sit with papers and maps planning still more trouble.
