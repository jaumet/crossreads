<p>28.9.15<br/>Tues 28th<br/>Last night the warboats kept up one of the heaviest bombardments I have yet heard apparently somewhere about Bulair,they were a long way off, but the sky was lit up &amp; looked exactly like the constant flashing of sheet lightning in a heavy storm, heavy rifle &amp; machine gun fire was also quite audable but too far off to affect us; We were on 'phone duty in the trench last night; This morning some warboats gave Achi-Baba a particularly hot time of it the noise here was a continual rumble like thunder &amp; a Monitor standing off the island of Enos was taking long shots with a 14 inch gun, the accuracy of the naval gunners in marvellous I took my tea with me this afternoon &amp; went around to the 'phone box and put in some work, putting in a dug-out; At 10 oclock last night several Taubes flew over and endeavoured to drop bombs on the warboats with no success.</p>
