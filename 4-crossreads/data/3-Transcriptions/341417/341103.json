<p>&amp; there is sand for miles.<br/>After leaving the ship we went by train to Cairo which we reached at between 1 am &amp; 2 am &amp; then transhipped into trams which carried us to the camp we now are at. I may say it was freezing cold the morning we reached here &amp; it has been so all along up till a few days ago we were bivouaced in the open &amp; it rained for two days &amp; nights so you can imagine I can fully realise what it is to sleep in wet blankets &amp; wet clothes. When one got up in the morning he was like a piece of frozen mutton &amp; had to wait for the sun to thaw him (Say a feather bed would be just alright now eh what!)<br/>Up to know we have had not much trouble only a few skirmishes, with no casualties The Terriers wiped out a tribe of Bedouins &amp; had a few wounded. They were under General Maxwell<br/>To-morrow we start on very strenuous</p>
