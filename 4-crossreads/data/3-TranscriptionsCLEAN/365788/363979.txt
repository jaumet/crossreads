(Mother please interpret.) - I was very glad to receive your nice little letter and hope you will write me another. Mummy told me you go to Dancing Class. How do you like it? There are such a lot of pretty flowers growing here. - Red Poppies, Daisies, Butter Corn Flowers and a lot of other pretty flowers. - Have you got a little garden? Every day we see lots of Aeroplanes flying in the sky. - They look just like very big dragon flies. With very much love and a lot of big Kisses. Your loving Uncle Fred.
