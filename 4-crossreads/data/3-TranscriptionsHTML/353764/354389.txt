<p>upon arrival here he did not know any of us &amp; was very bad.  We eventually got him back to Hospital where he now is very bad.<br/>Heard pretty definitely that we are to go to France in two months time.<br/>Only a routine day, never left the lines.</p>
<p>28.1.16<br/>To-day proved a very good one in the History of our Company.  We were reviewed at 2.30 pm by Major General Birdwood.  He is indeed a very nice man, &amp; all the troops over here speak very highly of him.  He spoke a few words to me &amp; I shall always remember them.<br/>Our fellows received another mail to-day, but as usual none for me.<br/>Played Cricket the remainder of the afternoon &amp; this compiled with the fact that we stood at attention for 2 hours, has made me very tired, so intend turning in very early.<br/> I am feeling very rotten on account of not getting any mail, as this is all one has to look forward to over here.</p>
