<p>A ration of wood 1 lb per man at present a daily occurrence whereas before we were lucky to get any. There was occasionally an issue about once a month. All the wood has to be brought in as this country is devoid of trees. It is all undergrowth &amp; brushwood holly etc. There was such a scarcity of fuel that we had to resort to grubbing out roots of the shrubs &amp; burn them with the aid of a little piece off a case the rations arrive in.</p>
<p>The other day I managed to secure a few eggs &amp; as our cooks had erected an oven made up a bread pudding &ndash; one of my old favourites.</p>
<p>Very cold to-day.</p>
