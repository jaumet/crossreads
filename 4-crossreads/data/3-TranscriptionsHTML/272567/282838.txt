<p>21/12/18 Gourdinne<br/>For our Xmas dinners we require a great deal of crockery which up to date we have not been able to procure as it is difficult to put hands on it. Am sending both Gorman and Hutton off on the quest again tomorrow. After mess yarned with Kennedy who today returned and then went back to my billet meeting Madame's son in law who is a mine manager at Charleroi and speaks fairly good English. The brasserie in which they are interested here is famous for an extremely light beer and seems to return them a good profit. Last night some vengeful civilian put a firestick into one of the hayricks belonging to the old Burgomaster who appears out of favour with a section here. Extremely cold evening.</p>
