<p>Sun Mar 24th<br/>Glorious day. The war news is of course the main topic for conversation.</p>
<p>Our Line has had to fall back a bit, but Fritz has had enormous losses.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that Paris is being bombarded, but it must be a new Gun Fritz has brought out.</p>
<p>Fritz certainly has Luck as far as the weather is concerned. In all our Big Pashs we have been blocked by rain.</p>
<p>After dinner I went into Warminster and had Tea there and went to Church afterwards.</p>
<p>Com. Letter 14 to B.E.</p>
<p>Mon 25th<br/>Germans re-capture Bapaume.</p>
<p>Perfect weather. We let the Fires out in the Mess as it was so warm.</p>
<p>"Darkey" finished up yesterday. The new Housekeeper is  certainly making some changes in the Staff.</p>
<p>There is quite a lot in the paper about Fritz's new Gun. It dropped shells into Paris yesterday at intervals of 8 mins from a distance of 75 miles.</p>
<p>The Huns claim a big number of Prisoners and Guns, but he has to fight for every inch of the Ground. The Kaiser is in command.</p>
<p>Get new crockery in the Mess.</p>
<p>Finished Letter No 14 to M.S.</p>
