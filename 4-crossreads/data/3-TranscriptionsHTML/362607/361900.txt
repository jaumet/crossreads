<p>18/7/16<br/>Dear Dad,  Why don't you try the bee-sting cure for your rheumatism. You ought to try it. It has cured when all the other treatment has failed. You will never be happy until  you get rid of it. You will have to try the bee sting on the arm &amp; leg so that the bee poison will travel into your hands &amp; feet.<br/>If ever I feel I want something tasty, I go to the Cafe right on the left hand of this Picture &amp; have fried eggs or cutlets or Ice Cream. Nearly all Restaurants have a Piano. You can imagine the noise when all the Australians were here. Every Cafe used to be Packed &amp; someone would be playing Choruses &amp; the whole lot roaring out. Of course everything is dead now. The poor Pommies only draw 3/6 a week &amp; they can't stand 2/- feeds on that. Try the bees.  Love Harry.</p>
