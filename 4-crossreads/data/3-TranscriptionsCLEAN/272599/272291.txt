 Work as usual.  The 14th F. A. is taking over today & our unit moves bag & baggage to Albert en route to where (?) The frost still holds mud & water in an iron grip, a few weeks ago since a thaw.  We do not leave till morning. Crowd of us go to Merricourt to Vaudeville Show. Barney with the Tommy guard. Find a queue 1/4 mile long waiting to get into show. Drift down to the entrance & after manoeuvering slip in & get fair seat. Huge building seating nearly 2,000, such a crush & hundreds unable to get in. Wouldn't Fritz have got a haul  till  if he dropped a few bombs. Show good & poor. Fine 13th Batt. Band though. 'Twas good to hear dinkum music again. Quips & unvarnished compliments.
