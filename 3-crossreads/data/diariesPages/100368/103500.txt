out to the Hospital Ship "Dunvegan Castle". This ship is not as good as the "Dongola".

Jan 15th Sat.
Heavy rain fell during the night and all day. The sea very choppy. Still in the harbour at Lemnos. No 2 S.H. who have been loading their hospital gear on board all day made a tremendous disturbance on board. They seem to have got a great deal of intoxicating liquors, the result is, the place is more like a rowdy public house on a Saturday night than a hospital ship.

Jan 16th Sun.
Went to the Church of England service to-day. The weather much improved. In No 2 S.H. still loading up their gear. The "Olympic" sailed passed us on its way out of the harbour.

Jan 17th Mon.
Sailed out of the harbour at eleven o’clock this morning. Fine weather and a calm sea. We sailed past many ships, warships etc and also the large hospital ship Mauratania as we sailed out of Lemnos Harbour. There were two good sized Hospital ships lying along side of the Mauratania and yet they looked like mere pigmies beside it. This made us realize how big the "Mauratania" is.

This ship the "Dunvegan Castle" has got the name of being a rocker and it is acting up
