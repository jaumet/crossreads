 steamed into Folkestone Station. Folkestone is a fine watering-place, and from all appearances, there is accommodation for a great number of summer visitors. We marched from the train to a large hotel which faces the sea, and which has been taken over by the Military Authorities as a Rest Billet &amp; there we were quartered for a few hours &amp; given some breakfast. Les &amp; Ron &amp; I had a walk along the beach and made a general tour of the Billet . 
 At 11 a.m. we steamed from Folkestone Pier across the Channel in one of the swift troopships kept for the purpose. Three such ships went across, together with two fine Hospital ships and a couple of Destroyers. It took about 1 &frac12; hours to reach Boulogne harbour. Once safe in port we were soon on the road &amp; made the best of our way to a Rest Camp about two miles from the wharf. The city was very quiet except for a few women &amp; children who worried us to buy sweets etc.
