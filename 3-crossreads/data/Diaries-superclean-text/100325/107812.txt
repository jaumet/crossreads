Went to Bde. office at 4.30 pm and received orders there for Battn. to be in position three miles out on sand dunes at a position corresponding to the I in Beit el Sharia on the map at 6.30 pm. Fortunately suspecting some such order had made a few preliminary preparations. At 5.20 the Battalion fully equipped marched out each man fed and carrying a ration. Machine guns in timbered wagon. Transport with food picks shovels also following. We were first battalion out. Reached destination right in centre of sand hills stony rises. Took up position in conjunction with other Battns. commenced entrenching. 
Very difficult to site trenches owing to nature of ground ? field of fire in some cases very limited. Machine guns trenches commanded watercourses. The men worked all night in two hour shifts and were just about done by morning. Turned in by Major Smith about 10 on sand with saddle as a pillow. The stars very bright and a low scented breeze blowing. Perched up on hill valley of desert with date palms in distance just discernable in the moonlight. The only sound the steady work of diggers with occasional change of shift. Slept until 4 am, all hands
