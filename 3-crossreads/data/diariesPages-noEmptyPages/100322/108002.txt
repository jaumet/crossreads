Marcinelle
The usual round of odd jobs done during the morning and after lunch went up the town with Dr Daniel to take tea or rather chocolate and cakes at a pastry shop where the waitress and a demoiselle sitting in a corner were evidently in league at the oldest profession in the world. Had mess and then tore away to have a dancing lesson with a little Belgian teacher who must be sick to death of clumsy people. Then returning to my billet found any amount of papers for signing. Spent the rest of the evening talking to Beith and his French friends (Belgians) ? kind hospitable people. There are said to be many of our chaps marrying Belgian girls but I have only signed one lot of papers.
