<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Received your very welcome letter No. 58 of 28th May yesterday.  I feel so sick about <strike>not</strike> your not getting my letters, what is a fellow to do.  I don't know.  I made up my mind I'd send a cable today anyhow, then I got up this morning to find your cable here about Jim McLean.  Thanks for letting me know.  It was a rotten shock, I haven't sort of quite realized it yet although I have been able to think of nothing else.  And it will be absolutely awful for Isabel, I shall have to write to her &amp; I don't know how I'm going to do it.  I can't help thinking its so unjust &amp; unfair &amp; really its hard to understand why these things happen.  Only three weeks ago I got a great little letter from him &amp; we had had such plans for the future, the spell I was going to have at Bringagee &amp; the yarns over the Fire after the others went to Bed.  I don't think I'll ever want to go to Bringagee again now.  Was Jim ill long?  I suppose it will be ages before I get any letters.</p>
<p>I'm hating everything today, fancy after waiting for</p>
