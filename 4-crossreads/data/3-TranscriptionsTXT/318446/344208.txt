 Same night 9.45 p.m. Three taubes have just been over &amp; dropped about 15 bombs.  The first night raid we have yet had &amp; I devoutly hope that it may be the last.  I had to turn out in pyjamas &amp; stand out with Bernard in the bitter cold for about half an hour.  There is a full moon so while we could not see him he could probably see us against the white sand.  It was miserable. 
 8 a.m., Jan. 9th 1914 Outside Rafa I was wrong;  there are no infantry here, only five brigades of Cavalry &amp; two batteries of guns, which guns have just started in. This is to be a raid, even if we take the place we shall not hold it, but return on the 10th. Two prisoners already captured declare that the numbers are 2000 turks, 40 germans &amp; M.Gs.
