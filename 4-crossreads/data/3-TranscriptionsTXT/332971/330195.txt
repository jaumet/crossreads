to the right- this makes us wonder if anything fresh has arisen- if Greece has joined in and they are going to Salonika- we get very anxious for news.  (You lucky beggars to be able to digest the world's news for breakfast every morning).  The Island from here looks perfectly barren- not a sign of vegetation to be seen. Only nests & rows of tents to the North- East & West & some windmills in the distance on the hills.14th  This morning at 8 am a steam-boat came alongside c the oldies & we immediately started for the inner Harbour- here everyone brought their cameras to light & many snaps were taken of the interesting boats & scenes as we passed in.  On anchoring Colonel Fiaschi was soon alongside in our little RX hospital boat to meet C. Fetherston & myself.  The fine old man he was pleased to hear the latest news of his wife & delighted with the snaps I had taken of her & his baby girl.  Now that I have actually re-joined the Unit any regret that had been lingering inside re on staying behind has quite vanished.The hospital is situated on a rise of land resembling a peninsula c water on 3 sides of it.  The Sisters tents extend to the banks of the waters edge.  The view on either side is beautiful
