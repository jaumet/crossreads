joke
 
The infantry (those chaps who walk and fight on foot) no longer call us the Light Horse Brigade. They call us the Lost Horse Brigade. (This is infantry humour).
There is one joke here that is too good to keep. The Indians say: "When the shrapnel shells burst overhead, the English run to the dug-outs, the Indians pray to Allah, but the Australians just look around and exclaim "where the hell did that come from?"
Another alleged joke. A bread ration was issued a few days ago instead of the inevitable biscuit ration. One trooper half in fun exclaimed: "Well, they might have given us butter with it." "Butter" cried his mate in astonishment, "Why, you'll be wanting flowers on your grave next." ..
I've got some rather good jokes, but I'll have to keep them till I get home.
Good bye- every-bodys. I've got to go ashore soon. Had a ripping day. (I'm too lucky Jean).
Love of love and tons of luck,
Yours
OL.
