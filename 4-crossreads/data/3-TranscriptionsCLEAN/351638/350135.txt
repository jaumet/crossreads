  
 At 1 a. m. of the following night the trench out of which the left column had been compelled to retire, was seized by a charge made by the 10th Light Horse.  The position has now been secured and connected with our previous line by a trench leading back from the left of the position to the farm at the green patch N.W.  of Kaiajik Aghala. The whole objective as thus been secured.
