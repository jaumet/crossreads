 JANUARY 1917 
 3 WEDNESDAY 
 Fine, but cold & cloudy. Took the 
 horses all out for walking exercise  
 in the morning while they made 
 new horse lines for them. Fixing up 
 harness & grooming horses in 
 the afternoon. 
 The name of the village we 
 are quartered near is 
 "Strazeele". Did not hear any 
 guns firing today, but suppose 
 it was because of the wind.
