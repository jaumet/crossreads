<p>August Monday 27 1917</p>
<p>Duties per usual. Full  day on.  Heavy work.  Tumble off to bed as soon as relieved. Some very bad cases in ward.  Likely to be some deaths in a day or two. <br/>A fine specimen of a Londoner, Diss, by name lies like a log with a fractured - spine. He is one of the finest built men I've ever seen only 23 too. The waste &amp; pity of it.</p>
