  
 21.8.15 to be attacked again this afternoon but did not wait to see any of the charging as I was on duty & thought I might be wanted on the 'phone, everyone had orders to stand to arms at 3 oclock as it was expected the Turks may counter attack here if they are driven back far on the left, & we are wear Plush & Langford were both wounded while sniping on the left yesterday;  Langford shoulder & Plush on the foot with shrapnel.  Received a the long delayed parcel from Edie T. this morning, a good deal of shrapnel flying about these parts this afternoon.  After the bombarding the left flank charged & immediately took a well & some trenches & were advancing steadily till dark.
