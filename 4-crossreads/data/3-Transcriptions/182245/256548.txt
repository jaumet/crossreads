<p>2 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny &amp; fairly warm in the</p>
<p>sun. Went for a bath in the</p>
<p>morning &amp; cleaning harness</p>
<p>ect all afternoon. There was</p>
<p>an inspection of everything</p>
<p>by the &quot;heads&quot; in evening, but</p>
<p>did not hear the result. There</p>
<p>was a few airial bombardments</p>
<p>right over our heads &amp; several</p>
<p>lumps of shell fell amongst</p>
<p>us.</p>
