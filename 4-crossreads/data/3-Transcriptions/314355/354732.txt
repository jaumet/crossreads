<p>April 15, 16<br/>58.<br/>wounded today:  Capt. Symons detached from us temporarily to the 1st Batt.</p>
<p>The first mail in today for about a week, for self two T.L.S., but barren numbers.  No announcement of Alec Waugh's "Resentment and O.P. [Other Poems]" yet nor of Masefield's two books.</p>
<p>59.<br/>We have today taken on strength, two cows, two pigs, and a family of cats.</p>
<p>For tea tonight &ndash; tongues (from 1 C.C.S. abandoned) boiled chicken, leeks and milk and Caf&eacute; au lait, in stock, Muscat and Champagne.</p>
<p>Still outward mail is closed.</p>
<p>April 16<br/>59.  a.m.<br/>Darkes of the Transport blew in to Dressing Room about midnight &ndash; silk hated and arrayed from an evening in Strazeele.  Full of Champagne, and Rabelaisian tellings of drinking and shells, eating and groutings.</p>
<p>"We had eleven fowls between eight of us, an' we had to have the B. for tea too!"<br/>"A man ought to get up to strength in horses with these Tommies here &ndash; like rabbits aren't they!"<br/>"An' we were picked up as stragglers!  A Tommy picquet bailed us up coming back &ndash; an' we with a pig between us!"<br/>"Was he dead?"<br/>"Yes, we shot him &ndash; a howzer rifle we grouted, and cut his head off with a razor!  But I was telling you, the picquet halted us &ndash;<br/>"Alt! where are you men going to!"<br/>"Get ---!"<br/>"Come on! all stragglers are to report here!"<br/>"Go an' get ---!"</p>
<p>So tomorrow our bacon or ham will be home grown.</p>
<p>The night quiet:  a black night of mist drizzle:  every while the eighteen pounders by us open out.  Hazebruck is being shelled by the Boche.</p>
<p>Reading "Notre Dame", but so far prefer "Les Miserables".</p>
<p>60.<br/>Two 2nd Batt. chaps through, and a yarning with them over Leon Chandon 1892.  Their confidence in an early ending amazing almost, yet half our Inf. seem the same way.  Am I a most perverted pessimist?  An ending in three months!  Yet if only the Tommies were well led!  Or is this optimism a resurrecting of last years when we were closely following the Boche retreat to Cambrai!</p>
