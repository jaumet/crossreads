up in the cage we descended the mine going down over a kilometre in depth. The cage went fairly fast and the first levels were wet and dripping. Reached the bottom at last and walked along the galleries. The increased atmospheric pressure caused a slight pain in the ears. The roof of the gallery revetted and struts had given in many places under the pressure. On small rails trucks were being hauled by ponies. The only light was from our lamps. After a long walk we found the heat so intense as to be uncomfortable and we came at last to the coal faces. The air full of dust and the miners crouched up picking almost naked and holding their lamps between their teeth one boy nearly nude buried waist deep in coal shovelling hard.
