<p>Howe<br/>Lindfield.<br/>Sydney.<br/>N.S.W.<br/>3 May 1915.</p>
<p>My Dear Alan,<br/>It seems a long time since we had a letter from you and I am hoping you are quite well. We saw you had arrived in Egypt but are hoping you are not to stay there very long.</p>
<p>By the time you get his, Uncle Jim will have started off with the 19th Battalion as Major. He has been wanting to go all along and yet dreaded upsetting everybody. But we all said he should go, &amp; he seems to be a great favourite, and I think some of the New Guinea men have been getting into trouble &amp; been sent off, so that Senior officers are scarce.</p>
<p>We hear that Rugby Union is to give him a wristlet watch &amp; he has had binoculars given him, and he says he doesn't want anything else. Of course Aunt Rose is very upset but young Jim says he can "skite" now at school as no other boy there has a father a Major.</p>
