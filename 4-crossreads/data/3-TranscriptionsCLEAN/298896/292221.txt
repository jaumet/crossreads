  
 the theatre party & going to the Opera being conducted there by a representative of the Club. We had paid 14 Francs each & had one of the best boxes in the house, probably a concession so it paid to go per means of the Club. Aida was the piece & it was wonderful. Magnificently staged, the Egyptian scenes were great & this combined with the good music made it very enjoyable. The building itself is a sight of a lifetime, rightly renowned the world over. Marble staircases on a huge scale communicates with each floor and a promenade room of great length & beauty is very popular between Acts. Gorgeously decorated & brilliantly lit with immense chandeliers, one could gaze at it for hours. Finished up the day feeling well satisfied with things in general.
