10/3/19 MarcinellePresided at a conference of Battalion commanders at BdeH.Q. and discussed matters of general import. Then to 22nd. and early back to Brigade. In the afternoon got my portrait taken for passport and then promenaded back to billet. Lesson at Ecole Berlitz at 4 until 5 and then back to G office Division where Miles was looking for me. Tried to work Davis into the job of Gala representative. To Dr. Matys for dinner. M. Jansin & his wife were there too - a lawyer. Very nice people. Mme. Matys is still a beautiful woman and has been a beauty. What epicurean feasts - such fish pates, such wine. Bottle after bottle carefully chosen and graded for taste. Till 11.30 we ate drank and talked.
