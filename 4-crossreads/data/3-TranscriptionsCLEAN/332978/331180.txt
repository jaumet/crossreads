  
 101 Dec 25th arrival there all hands were rather merry so we did not stay long. 
 Exceedingly heavy fall of snow tonight & all day today 
 Tonight word was recd that all officers for Switzerland will leave tomorrow night This news was gladly welcomed & we were so happy that we did not know  how  what to do - all hands retired fairly early on account of making an early start tomorrow - 
 December 26th All Heavy luggage packed & taken to Drill Hall [indecipherable]. I was one of the first & was successful in having my box & 5 Kit Bags censored by 11.30 am - I also succeeded in having my letters received in Germany, censored, also other valuable Documents, including my address book autograph book & Photo album - The search was not a very thorough one. Packed my hand baggage, this afternoon. 
 Fancy Dress Ball held tonight - It was a screaming farce Some appearances were really excellent 
 Played Bridge, & after saying goodbye to my friends we paraded at 11 pm to be personally searched. This was not a very thorough one. We left camp all invalids in a coach,  about midnight  1 am & eventually entrained after almost freezing - Gracie, Tremlott Stones & I kept together - 
 December 27th We were taken off the train at some place at 8 am & provided with Breakfast, which was indeed very acceptable. 
 On arrival at Constance we were taken to some Hotel & there provided with another good meal, the best meals we ever had in Germany, supplied by Germans - It is typical tho of the Hun to make a great fuss of prisoners on leaving the country, so as to create a very good impression & also to forget  what  the bad treatment we had. 
 We entrained again at 8 pm & at 10 past 8 crossed the Border & said goodbye to Germany. Such cheers I have never heard before It was impossible for us to realise that we were actually in Switzerland & not in the land that we unfortunately will never forget - at all the big stations in Switzerland English spoken people greeted us most heartily & provided chocolates cakes cigarettes & Bouquets also coffee
