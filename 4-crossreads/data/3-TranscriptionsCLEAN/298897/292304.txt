  
 Wednesday 28th June. Slept up on deck for the last night being called up at 2.15 A.M.  We had breakfast our last meal on the ship all being on the wharf by 5 A.M. the ship returning immediately to Alexandria.  The local residents all had the Gippy sayings off by heart, such as Sieda, eggs acooked etc. & greeted us with them with great glee.  Bread, buns biscuits, oranges & such things were on sale, by women & boys.  We entrained that is the whole shipment of about 1500 in one train of 39 carriages, the carriages being small tho' comfortable.  The sergeants were fortunate on having a second class compartment & only five in each which allowed us sleeping room.  Wet weather greeted our arrival & we wended our way through mud for a short distance.  Our route lay along a section of the coast, the line passing over several viaducts & through long tunnels, splendid views greeting us everywhere.  It was good to see homes again with their gardens attached & youngsters playing in them.  Tile works were fairly common & practically all houses had tile roofs throughout the country they evidently being very cheap.  Thatched roofs did not appear until we were well past Paris,
