I am applying making an application for the Baby Health Centres. As I worked under you at Cairo, Ismalia, France & Caulfield, I thought it would be of great value to me. - Unfortunately I did not secure any from Doctors or Matrons while in the Military, so must get a couple now. I wrote to a Miss Simpson & she came over to see me this morning and told me to get in my application at once with a few testimonials; hence my hurry.
