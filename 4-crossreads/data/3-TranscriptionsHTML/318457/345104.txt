<p>[9-11 Sept 1914]</p>
<p>The German Fleet was reported by the Admiralty as "cornered" some two or three weeks ago. We don't know where the "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" may be; most probably they are amongst the Marshall and Caroline groups of islands. The "Emden" and another small cruiser are supposed to be in the localities.</p>
<p>Word has come that Admiral [indecipherable], Chinese Squadron is sweeping the seas along toward the east and will probably junction with our fleet near New Guinea. Has one or two Russian and Japan vessels also.</p>
<p>The north has been left in the hands of Japan to manage.</p>
<p>We joined the Flag at Rossell Id at 10am on 9th Sept (just a month from similar junction at a rendezvous) , and proceeded with her and the rest of the fleet at 8 knots north. At daylight we and the destroyers separated and increased speed to 16 knots. This brought us to St Georges Chan at about 2am on Fri 11th Sept.</p>
<p>The attack was made in light moonlight at 3.30, we entering north of the island in the Chan, instead of south as before. The destroyers searched the harbour and the bays adjacent but found no warships. Two hulks full of coal were located. The Flagship with the troopship "Berrima" arrived in the chan. about 10am. At 7am the small force of 50 men</p>
