  
 Hear from a pal in the Coy - that a parcel arrived from Mr Allnutt & was much enjoyed by the remaining sigs. Will you write and thank Mr. A. please & say I enjoyed the good things by proxy - nothing wasted. Things seem to have been pretty lively out there but never forget the cause that thousands are ready to fight for must have strong arguments in its favor - the mere fact that it causes you a heap of annoyance is not any reason to condemn it - our war no doubt causes more discomfort for a cause less vital in the eyes of the worker who has little to lose. There is nothing noble about that strike ...there is nothing even human about the 'Jungle of Strafes.' 
 I note that the jingle entitled "The Storm Riders" has been well received by sundry critics but don't go much on it myself - because it is "Bulletin ise" after all & therefore not quite there. Have scribbled other scraps one of which is given herewith - but I don't feel quite capable of literary effort with the mud of Flanders still heavy on my soul. I can write of that but not for sane eyes to read. Love to one & all from Harry.
