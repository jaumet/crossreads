Dear Dad.
Miss Heffernan went away today from the school.  We have some new pictures.  I get nought nearly every day in Dictation and sometimes I only get one.  And we will not see Miss Heffernan tell next Monday.  And we have a new song called Summer Rain.  Insted of God Save the King.  When Mother called anna she says Ruth Frank Ather Anna. Much love from Anna and Ruth.  To your self. Xxx etc. And you mate xxx etc.
Vote yes.
