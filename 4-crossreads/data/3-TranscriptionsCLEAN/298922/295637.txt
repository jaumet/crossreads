  
 Tuesday 4 December 1917 
 Last night at dinner we bumped into something & everyone stood up - it may have been wreckage. This morning at 4 a.m. we got S.O.S. again from a boat in our rear, which had been torpedoed but we seem to be protected too well by our escort. It is moonlight at 4 a.m. Only about 4% of sinkings occur in the dark. Calmer & warmer.  I've written Laura & a few others  but no use posting to you till we arrive Egypt,  will post others Malta .
