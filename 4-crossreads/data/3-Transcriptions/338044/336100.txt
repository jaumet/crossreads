<p>Oct 31st :- Awake early preparing for departure. Final breakfast was best we had on board. About 8-30 am we hauled up anchor  &amp;  put into Suez (Port) Tewfik arriving about 9 am &amp;  the first companies disembarked. We now had to carry the sick ashore   Niggers were here swimming all around the boat &amp;  diving for money. The port is a very clean &amp; industrious place. At 12-30 pm we entrained &amp;  were off. As we  passed through Suez one was struck with the filth &amp;  squalor of the place. Animals, fowls etc live in the houses with the people themselves  The buildings are oriental style, square &amp; flat roofs, some crumbling  The Indians are camped all along the line to Cairo &amp;  we were cheering them as we passed. Stopped at several small stations, where we bought dates &amp;  fruit of all descriptions, Tel-el-Kebir being on our route.</p>
