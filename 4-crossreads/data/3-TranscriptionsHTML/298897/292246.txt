<p>sleep towards morning.  Went on duty in dispensary &amp; also sick parade altho' I now knew more what the trouble was, first a strain &amp; getting a cold on top of it through the draughty train.  Managed to keep going all day although marked L.D. &amp; in the afternoon strolled out to see the trenches or embankments used in the battle of Tel el Kebir 1882.  They still stand &amp; are mounds of sand about 7 ft high in front &amp; 10 ft behind.  More later about this scrap.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11th Jan '16<br/>Had an off day Wednesday &amp; Thursday nothing much doing only I felt very off colour &amp; unable to work.  Violent headaches &amp; severe pain in lung.  I decided to hang out as long as possible.  Went from duty.</p>
