How to run the war
Weve heard a fair amount of noise,On how to run the warWithout undue extravance [extravagance?],But here's a little more,A lot of things you issue usIn many ways are good,But even yet economyIs little understood
Our biscuits, now, for mending roads(Where metal reigns supreme)Or armour plating round the tanks-They'd make a bonzer schemeOr soaked for weeks in keroseneThey might be used for fuelAnd save some hero from the coldWhen winter time is cruel.
