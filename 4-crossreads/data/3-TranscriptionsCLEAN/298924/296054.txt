  
 Thursday 13 March 1919 S.S. Ulimaroa Embarked men at Kantara & sailed at 3 p.m., leaving the wife behind at Port Said to come on in Derbyshire.  I leave her luggage with me or most of it. Weather Hot & boat crowded altho' we have 6 Red X nurses on board, my wife was not allowed to come.  The 2 Regts. 1st & 2nd are on Board with Gen. Cox as O.C. Transport.  52 Officers & 1032 or. ranks on a boat built to carry about 400 passengers.  However, everyone is glad to say Goodbye to Egypt.  I got all my Stores safely into the hold & find I share a Cabin with 2 other Majors.  Of course as Gen. Cox is here we have a Band!!!
