<p>Alcester is about 5 miles from Stratford on Avon, the country about is very pretty, we were trying to get leave to go to Stratford but couldent, you have to be in every evening a 6 p.m. &amp; they are very strict about us being in to time.  I was up before the head at the other hospital on being in 8 minutes late but of course nothing was done to us.  I think I have just about given you all the news so will say au revoir with best love &amp; kisses to all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Douglas</p>
<p>P.S.  will be writing to father soon.<br/>Doug.</p>
