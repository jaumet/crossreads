<p>8 February, 1916<br/>We got a move on at 1.0 pm &amp; arrived at Heloun at a bit before sundown but there was very little water in the channel so it took a long time to water the horses &amp; it was about dark when we were fixed up with horses on the lines &amp; able to sit down to some tea.  The majority of the boys went to a concert afterwards but Joe Woods &amp; I went for a walk around the town &ndash; It is a quiet little place &amp;  has many good buildings also [indecipherable] some smelly corners. I bought a packet of cigarettes named The Australian Flag. Joe &amp; I gave these the cake for being the worst we had ever smoked so I kept the packet so I could give some to the boys next morning</p>
