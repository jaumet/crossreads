<p>November, 1915<br/>Thursday 25<br/>Our men are happy tho' cold I have made a Terrace 10ft wide on the side of a Hill facing the Sea bright breezy &amp; bracing but not too many hours of daylight now &ndash; The <u>K</u> has been to Greece we are all anxious to know what those chaps mean to do, "Sell us a Pup I think."<br/>From Imbros island came <u>cabbages</u> &amp; <u>oranges</u>, but not enough, however, "it is well with the child" &amp; I am still about 12 stone 7 lbs by the Quartermasters Steelyards. One little Steamer has been salvaged &amp; I see is afloat once more they have a rough time these little trawlers.</p>
