<p>Revielle at 5.</p>
<p>Men &amp; horses went out to the Signal Station on the end of the hills this morning, out there catacombs abound everywhere &amp; in them are hundreds of mummies all sorts sizes &amp; shapes, some of the boys ranged them up in tiers &amp; took several photos of same.</p>
<p>Chas &amp; I went for our usual ride &amp; met a nigger half way on the way back, upsetting his equilibrium but beyond severally knocking his mount about nothing else mattered, the niggers are still on the cheeky side &amp; nearly every day we are coming to grips with them especially the kids, who are using the whip too freely for my liking.</p>
<p>Mail expected tomorrow so am looking forward to it, turned in at 9.30 tired out.</p>

<p>The C.O. &amp; Pard came home by the 4.30 train. Pard rode in the Boss walked, both bikes OK no spills. Maj McColl has secured the Sg. Teddy has the e Troop &amp; a Lance Jack of the 2nd Sig Tp is to command this unit so we are in for an uproarious time.</p>
<p>Today has been again very warm it registering 121&deg; in the shade &amp; two months yet  to go to Summer so we are likely to be greasespots before long.</p>
<p>Mail has arrived at last &amp; I only got two letters from home, nothing in them whatsoever, they acknowledged receipt of certain parcels but not a hint as to what they contained.</p>
<p>Today was a beaut it being 121&deg; in the shade &amp; the poor old mokes are feeling it frightfully.</p>
<p>Turned in at 9.30.</p>
