 Things are a bit brighter today. I am feeling a bit better. We got 1/2 loaf of bread per man. 
 Today is the first day that the heat has had a sting in it. We all had our coats off on the afternoon parade. 
 The Companies have put on an extra spurt with the trench digging & the aeroplanes are up every day. We hear all sorts of rounds of where the Turks are, varying from 7000 yds to forty miles but none are to be relied upon.
