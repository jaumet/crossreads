get to work again. When I went in to see the Doc. just before dinner was ready he told me that I was fit to move on and kept my card back to fix it up, so I suppose that I will draw my uniform tomorrow morning and will leave about Wednesday. Just after we came down from the trenches Mrs. Barker's parcel arrived it was just in nice time to catch me, before I came down here. Tell Mother that I received her letter with Harrys verses. The Ausi, the lines are very good, I have not seen a Bulletin yet with the other verses, that She Spoke of .. but may pick one up anytime, we get more of them lately than we used to, and I allways go through them for verse by various authors. Sometime when you write would you ask Mother if I may have a copy of her verses. "Children of Empire" I meant to ask once before now I must ring off with heaps of Love to all. a Special Share for yourself and Mother from your Loving Bro. Chas.
