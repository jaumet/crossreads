<p>One of our guns is to be shifted and placed in a new position and this necessitated a lot of work to some of our chaps to-day. It is wonderful the perfect Sang Froid of our chaps as they go to and fro carrying ammunition and other articles regardless of the shells and missiles flying all around. Went down to our base store in the evening with my forage Party and finished up around 10 PM. Every night now I have to go round to our guns and give an issue of rum. It is a great stimulant now as things are at such a high pitch.</p>
<p>Monday 9th Aug<br/>The Battle is raging at higher force than ever and the enemy is certainly fighting very stubborn. This morning they sent shells all around our store quarters while our guns kept them very busy indeed. Just at daybreak</p>
