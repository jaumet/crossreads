<p>This is what the Prussian Militaries of Democratic government in Australia has brought upon the workers.  If we are not holding hard and fast to the Motto Viribus unitia" We shall be trampled under <strike>our feet</strike> the golden heel of the ever destruction plotting capitalists.  We are ever ready to shake hands with our fellowworkers because we are class conscious and because we pursue the very principles at which you are aiming at therefore we call out to you to have us set free from this awful desperation and suspense, and we all know your will. It should, we think be easier four our fellow-workers  in Australia to get us out of this dungeon,  because the military power of Germany was up till recently a most dangerous tools in the hand of the government to suppress the workers than it is here in Australia.  If you will fail us you will fail yourselves and all the ideals of the international <strike>capitalists union.  But then it is too late</strike></p>
<p><strike>We are appealing to you with so much more confidence since we</strike> will shatter against the steel wall of <strike>an</strike> Prussianised international Capitalist Union.  But then it will be too late</p>
