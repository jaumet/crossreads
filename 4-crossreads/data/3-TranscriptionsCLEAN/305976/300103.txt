  
 Wednesday Jan 1 - 1919 The old year passed quietly and another year has commenced. It is said that all the Troops from this front will be home in Ausy for Easter. Jan 20 - 1919 We have made ourselves comfortable at Rafa. It is getting monotonous waiting for the time to go home. There is very little doing. Three times a week we have lectures under the Educational scheme. We have Race meetings twice a week, Football & sports to fill in the time of waiting.
