 1917 JANUARY 
 4 THURSDAY 
 Raining first part of the morning 
 &amp; very cold wind rest of the 
 day. We were told that 
 the 27 th &nbsp;Battery had been broken 
 up &amp; that the right section 
 were going to the 25 th &nbsp;Battery 
 &amp; the left to the 26 th . We got&nbsp; 
 all packed up ready to go 
 &amp; then the order came we 
 were not moving today &amp; we 
 had to unpack it all again. 
 Clean harness &amp; grooming 
 in afternoon. I am glad 
 we are going to 26 th &nbsp;Battery 
 as we will have men over us 
 instead of an ignorant lot&nbsp; of lads  
 Although I dont like the moving 
 part of it at all.
