<p>27 June 1918 Thursday<br/>Last night, Jacko more active, stronger Patrols, Colored lights &amp; a lot of artillery kept us from sleeping- but don't feel so feverish this morning- RAMADAN time of fasting is now <strike>over</strike> on so Jacko may be feeling agressive.  The Water we use for washing out of the adjoining swamp is so salt, a mans shirt is like a board &amp; a thin white layer remains on the SKIN after washing-<br/>1 man killed 3 wounded by Shells today-<br/>Ramadan finishes about 10th July but we are not worrying.</p>
