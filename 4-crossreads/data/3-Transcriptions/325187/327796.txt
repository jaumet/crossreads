<p>I frequently knock 2 men riding on 1 donkey I mean natives,   They have worked it out to a fine art how much work can be got out of how little feed, very cruel.  <u>"Starlings"</u> are plentiful &amp; I saw an Arab child, with one tied by the leg on a piece of string, as a TOY they are a cruel race- TOY lasted 3 days<br/>Now camped at <strike>Shusha</strike> on edge of Desert near <strike>Samalut</strike>.<br/>Pneumonia Plague is at this village &amp; many deaths- so we hope to move soon  We are collecting Rifles like in Africa, &amp; the Mamoor has lent me an old Blunderbuss of shot gun &amp; <u>10</u> cartridges- so when 5 or 6 Pigeons get a line I pull- not sport but Tucker</p>
