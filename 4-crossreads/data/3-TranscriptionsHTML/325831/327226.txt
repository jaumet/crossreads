<p>3.<br/>The Chief Justices son Clifford has been with me all the time in France but I expect will now have gone to the 2nd Battery &ndash; men on leave have all called up to see me while at Wandsworth Hospital which I left yesterday for here &ndash; (8th A. Auxiliary Hosp) &amp; they tell me how all the men are getting on. It seems he is quite well thought. Oct Nov Dec were very cold &amp; muddy propositions. He is a very good chap quite one of the most reliable &amp; hardworking we have &ndash; which is saying a great deal.</p>
<p>While I was at Wandsworth I believe your son came into the ad to see another officer. I did not</p>
<p>4.<br/>know until I heard his name mentioned afterwards or should have liked to have had a yarn with him. I believe he went over to France a day or so subsequently.</p>
<p>I am afraid my letters home aren't so interesting these days as they used to be perhaps at first. I don't know but somehow we get less impressionable or more concerned with what is actually going on &amp; that makes it more difficult to supply any sort of chronicle on the spot especially in face of censorship regulations which are scrupulously observed in the common interest. So I am afraid sometimes  our letters are too much like the official communiques which probably suffer under the same disabilities more interesting after all than my past events are the things we all expect to happen shortly &amp; we hope force a rescission. After that the lucky ones of us will have some good long stories to tell &ndash;</p>
<p>With my best regards &amp; thanks</p>
<p>Believe me yours truly</p>
