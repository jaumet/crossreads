<p>Fine &amp; warm, I went down to</p>
<p>L&#39;Eppinette dump in morning</p>
<p>with waggons for amunition</p>
<p>&amp; we had a half holiday in</p>
<p>afternoon. Had a turn out</p>
<p>at night but got back about</p>
<p>eleven oclock. A lot of the</p>
<p>boys went for a bath in</p>
<p>the morning. Laurie Cadell</p>
<p>was here in afternoon</p>
