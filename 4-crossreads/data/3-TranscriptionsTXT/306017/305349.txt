July 1916got hit.  One horse was wounded in the shoulder.  We withdrew to about 1200 yds from the Turkish position & sat down & watched them all day.  We did not fire a shot  B Troop got 1 Turk prisoner also his camal.  He was very thirsty & kissed Frank Fitzgerald  Seemed to be very pleased at his treatment.  The Wellingtons got 8 prisoners & they got their photo taken quite a number of times.  They must have felt quite in the [indecipherable]  We left Oghratina at 6 pm  The Turks made no movement at all.  We got back to camp at 11 pm & got 4 hrs sleep.
The 1st Brigade went out just after midnight of the 23rd got into touch with Abdul & had 2 men killed & 4 wounded.  An enemy machine said to be a Fokker appeared over our camp & was attacked by one of our biplanes.  They had a savage & long fight.  The Turkish machine had to descend & both our pilot & observer got wounded.  Heard later that the pilot died shortly after getting his machine back
