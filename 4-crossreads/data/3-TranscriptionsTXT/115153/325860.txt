 to headquarters, and told that I was to be sent to a Signalling School at Fleselless for a month's training. This came as a surprise to me, and it was at the same time very acceptable, as it meant a month of comparative comfort to trench life. I was included in a party of four men going to the school, and while we were waiting at the top of the Headquarter's dug out for one of the men to join us, we saw a great airfight going on overhead in which about 8 aeroplanes from each side were engaged. The British drove the Germans off, but two British Machines were forced to descend, and fortunately they landed on our ground allowing the airmen to escape. The Germans got the correct range and later, battered the planes to pieces. 
 However, we who were going to school, started on our way just before dusk. When we arrived back as far as Cinque Ports Camp we were given rations for two days use, and a new set of clothes throughout. Getting the new clothes was a relief in itself for we were instantly free of vermin again, and that meant comfort when we were to go to sleep. We marched through all the next day and we came to Albert where we stayed the night in tents which were very comfortable in comparison to the trenches, in spite of the fact that it was so cold that icicles were hanging from the inside of the tents. Next morning, (this was Sunday,) a motor lorry arrived at 9 o'clock and conveyed us to Fleselles, landing us there at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. We were shown to our billets and we deposited our kits in them, then went in search of a good wine estaminet, where we had wine and a plate of fried eggs each. 
 Next morning we were called out on a special parade by the Colonel of the School, and given instructions as to what we had to do and how we had to do it. We had to shine our buttons and badges, and clean our boots with dubbin every morning and be always cleanly shaved. After being so long in the trenches it was a pleasure to be clean and fresh again, and we took every interest in our work to show our appreciation of it. During the month I was at the School, I studied hard, and got good results at the end of the term when we had an examination. On one occasion we had a "Mock Stunt" which was carried out by the whole of the School in Fleselles. We employed signalling apparatus from division to
