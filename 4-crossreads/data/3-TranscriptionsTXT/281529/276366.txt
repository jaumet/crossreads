 1/5/18   Lavieville &amp; Warloy 
 In a salvaged bath had a splendid bath with plenty of hot water and my batman Charlesworth had also for me a complete change of clean clothes.   Visited all the companies during the day and settled on the dress for tomorrow.   Everything continued abnormally quiet &amp; the men were strolling about outside their trenches and playing cards etc.    At dark our relief arrived (21 London Regt).  Very many small youths of 18 in this unit &amp; it does seem a shame to put them at it so young.   The relief was over very soon &amp; we walked down to our horses.   The streets of the village were congested with much traffic of men and horses and had the enemy shelled he would have made a good harvest.   He did not shell probably because any retaliation would have got on to him himself in his own villages.   My horse seemed in excellent nick and was tended by Murphy.   A silent ride across country over grass and growing crops.   The scene weirdly illuminated by gunflashes.   The delightful and picturesque towns of Baizieux &amp; Warloy are crammed full of troops and horse lines and camps disfigure what is probably one of the prettiest places in France.   Arrived in the town we found our Band playing the companies in and were then conducted to a fine house where all the officers were put up.   A good mess and pleasant to see all the officers together.   I have a good room luxuriously furnished and lacking only one thing.   Why these people don't move their furniture I don't know.   If left it must unfailingly be blown to pieces by bombardments.
