<p>&hellip;. I saw Captain Ferguson down the road the other day.  I think he is a son of the Judge.  It was early morning and he was coming out of the trenches.  The night before his Company had a perfect Hell of a time.  They were attacked at dusk, and I never saw such a deluge of shell as rained on their locality.  It was just one long rumble, so much so that one couldn't distinguish the burst of one single shell, but just a continual rumble.  He looked very tired and worn out, but was lucky to be alive, if you could only have seen what was slung at them. &hellip;.</p>

<p>&hellip;. My Company had a bit of a scrap the other night, which I fortunately managed to pull through with a practically whole skin and a little bumping.  Two of my officers were killed and the other two wounded, but the casualties on the whole were not so heavy as I feared, and no ground was lost.  The General was rather pleased with the way things went. &hellip;.</p>
