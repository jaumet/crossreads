First of all we gazed on the Pyramid of Cheops the largest of the 6, which rears its head up towards

the sky for 400 feet. There are 5 other Pyramids of various sizes, and then the other wonder, the Sphinx. This must have been a very beautiful piece of work when it was first erected, as it still shows signs of it, but a few odd thousand years will make a difference to anything. The Arab also took us into several tombs of ancient Egyptian Kings, and their wives and daughters. The carving on them was most interesting and the guide pitched a yarn about each of them. One thing I noticed in particular was that when giving us the history of the various Royal Families. He would say this is King so and so and his wife and his daughter but no mention of the Wives or daughters names, so evidently women folk didn't count for much in those days, but what a difference now. We also visited the temple of the Sphinse and Campbell's tomb. This tomb is the burial place of some great Egyptian princess, and was excavated by Col. Campbell, whom it is named after. Her coffin can be plainly seen. It is carved out of a solid block of blue marble. After seeing all this we paid off our guide 15 disasters (5d each) and took a  P.Ts. worth of tram ride to the Zoo. This is a fine place. There is a good collection of birds and animals, and the gardens are beautiful. We ran into a party of Egyptian kiddies and they were very interested in Billeys gold tooth. I took a snapshot of them and Stan Wright took another, and I promised to send the teacher a picture, if they turned out good.
