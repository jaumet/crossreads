19/12/18 Gourdinne
We entered Gourdinne at 1.30 pm and found the place not too bad. I am lodged with the owners of the brasserie. Found the Marie's place â€“ a rich man evidently. Had something to eat here and then went over to the mess. Drank wine with some people at the local school and then had long talks with people about all the atrocities at Louvain & which they substantiated. Everyone seems to be well lodged here and quite comfortable. the village is clean and the houses ditto. Some are sewered and in nearly all there is electric light. I wrote and read after mess at the billet. The place is beautifully comfortable and the people seem to have plenty of money. There is every convenience in the house and yet the people do not seem to get much of real pleasure out of their money.
