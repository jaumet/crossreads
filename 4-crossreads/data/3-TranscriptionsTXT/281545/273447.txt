Laying Machine.    Having picked up three trucks of sleepers behind the Engine I was hooked on to three trucks of Rails & the Track Layer & after obtaining a Lunch from the Coy's Cook House & the gang finished their lunch, work was started.   A number of men were on the trucks rolling the rails up to the Layer & another lot were carrying sleepers from the trucks behind & placing them ahead & the Gib of the Layer would pick up a Rail which was rolled alongside from the Rear & place it ahead on the Sleepers, when I would move ahead a few yards until the next rail was placed & so on until all the Sleepers & rails were laid which took us three hours.   It was now after 3 Pm & after placing the Layer & Empties where I picked them up, I came back through the Balloon Siding were I had to shunt a load of Material out & make up a Train for Arques.   After completing I started & in a few minutes arrived at Arques were I shunted my load into a Siding & came back to St Omer & signed off at 7.30 Pm after a very long day of 15 hours although very interesting & instructive.   After a hot tea, & a chat I turned in at 9 Pm & had a grand sleep as I was very tired.
