Here Hop & I also met Eric & after posting our letters that we hoped would pass the censor  we strolled out into the street again. [Queen St]  & met a Cingaleee Hotel Porter dressed just like a woman who mentioned a good dinner, which was followed by Lead on McDuff!  Walk, &deg how we walked to keep up with him but after a round about trip through a part of Gordon Gardens we arrived at the British India Hotel. In Gordon Gardens where we passed was a large marble statue of Queen Victoria & at the base was a large pond with fountain & near by two coal black boys who were evidently employed there.
