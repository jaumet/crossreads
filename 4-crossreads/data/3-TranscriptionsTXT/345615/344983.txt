 Our chaps have had a heavy time of it &ndash; the Roads were very soft &amp; the waggons getting bogged continually &ndash; so it was a case of pulling each other out by turns consequently there were G.S. Waggons all over the countryside, in addition to bogged Motor Cars &amp; other vehicles. If the roads had been better so as the armoured cars could have joined in, the engagement would have been more decisive

 The weather  is  has been miserable today
