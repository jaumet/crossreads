pleasant evening returned to the boat at 11PM.
June 30th - 19Leaving Melbourne at 7AM it was some 5 hours later when we cleared Port Phillip and got what we expected, some very dirty weather
The boat having no cargo and only 300 odd boys on board it naturally does the cork act with interest and at present we are tossing to beat the band, but Sydney is only a little way off.
