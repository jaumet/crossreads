Shall try to write more letters if staying in. We are supposed to vote to-morrow for or against  Mi  Compulsory Military Service etc. Shall tell you next letter how I've voted. I have not received one Melb. Paper since I've left Egypt. - The Una, I did receive last week - but no newspaper. We did wish to read what the Argus was saying about it. Received a paper "Manifesto to Australian Soldiers. from Mr W. M. Hughes, - read it & talked it over, so have quite decided which way to vote.
