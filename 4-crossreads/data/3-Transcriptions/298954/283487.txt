<p>1917<br/>Fri. 22nd June.<br/>The explosion of these caused the vessel to sink a couple of feet on an even keel &ndash; but no further.</p>
<p>Later, an enormous bomb was taken over and placed in the poop &amp; kerosene was sprinkled over the decks.</p>
<p>The bomb caused a terrific explosion &ndash; which appeared to take an upward track &amp; nearly succeeded in blowing off the poop &amp; displacing the mainmast.   Another bomb had no better result &ndash; and the water-logged vessel would not fire.</p>
<p>These bombs were each apparently more than half the size of a mine!</p>
<p>After the bombing failure shelling was commenced.   All the afternoon shells were poured into the little vessel &ndash; not one of which succeeded in hitting a mast.</p>
<p>Shelling was stopped at dusk, after between 30 &amp; 40 shells had been fired.</p>
