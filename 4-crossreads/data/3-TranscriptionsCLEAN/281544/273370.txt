was charged 21/4 Franc's anyhow I gave them a 5 Franc Note & they had to be satisfied, it was only a dodge on their part & it did not succeed as well as they expected, when we got outside it was pitch dark, we could hardly see our hand before us & arm & arm we went along, picking our way through the darkness dodging Soldiers here & there, we tried another picture show but it was crowded so we decided to pay a visit to the Notorious Garden of Eden, we soon found the place & in we went & found the place crowded with Soldiers of all sorts, sitting at small tables laughing & joking with French girls who only had Silk Gowns on, their attitudes soon disgusted me, but as I often thought I would like to visit a Garden of Eden my wish was gratified, we had a few drinks there & left it at 7 Pm, satisfied of what I saw, we went along then to look for quarters to stop for the Night & after again being directed by a M. Police we soon found a Cafe called the Evening Star No. 26
