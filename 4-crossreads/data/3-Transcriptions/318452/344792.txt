<p>Came on by Lorry.<br/>Thursday 15th Came in to <strike>Wardaques</strike> Wardreques</p>
<p>Friday 16th<br/>Left Wardreques about 9 oclock on a Motor Lorry. We came through Arques then to Limbres then Wizernes &amp; reached our destination Elnes about 1 oclock. The country here is rather pretty several larger Paper Mills are to be found about. The trees have lost their leaves &amp; the dull foggy days detract from the beauty of the place.</p>
<p>Saturday<br/>The Brigade rested for a day here. The men have been marching for 4 days and have still another 2 days to go They average about 10 miles per day but they came out of the trenches straight on to the road &amp; are a bit</p>
