<p>12th<br/>Arrived at Cairo 2.30 am, shunted to a siding two miles on where we detrained and had some cocoa &amp; bread &amp; cheese at a stall There was only one thing wrong with it There was not enough. <br/>There we unloaded horses, and proceeded to Kasse-el-Nil barracks which is about a mile from the station where we watered them.<br/>Started for Mena at 8.45. It was the worse march I have been on but the scenery round about was gorgeous  Everyone including officers were tired and exausted from want of food and sleep when we arrived at Mena a distance of 11 miles from Cairo, at 9.30 am.<br/>More fooling about till 11.30 am. At 12.30 we had some dry bread and cheese. Plenty of work till 6 pm then bless me if I was not put on picquet. The horses were pretty bad and were continuously breaking loose.<br/>13th<br/>64 hours without sleep and only bread and cheese. I am dead beat  Have till 12 noon to have some sleep, then get to work again.<br/>We are now camped practically in the shadow of the pyramids. It is all sand but it is clean. There are 70-000. troops here now including the English [Tommies?]<br/>We are now on quarter rations</p>
