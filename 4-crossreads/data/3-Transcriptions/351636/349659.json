<p>Dear Mr. Layton<br/>We are sending to you an applicant in need of help until she receives her Military Pay &ndash;</p>
<p>Do you think she will be able to obtain assistance this week? as I am afraid she may be placed in awkard circumstances unless she has some help.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Ethel M. Wallack</p>
