Sunday 1 DecemberA walk round the Station & there a scene of desolation & wreckage is to be seen, scarcely imagined.  Trucks & railway lines are thrown yards away & it is the greatest bit of destruction I have seen.
Monday 2 DecemberFine day & I took advantage of it to run into Muageuge, the great Frontier fort of this district.  It is indeed some fortress & the ramparts are very solid indeed.  The streets are narrow & the town old fashioned.
