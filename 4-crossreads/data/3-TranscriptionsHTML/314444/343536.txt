<p>Dear Mrs Ellis.</p>
<p>It is with sincerest Sympathy I write to you at this time when your heart is so filled with sorrow for the loss of him you held so dear your splendid son. Yet in your sorrow you must proudly sorrow when you realize how he fulfilled his part as a man, even to the laying down of his life for all he held so dear, his home &amp; his country in the great Cause of the worlds freedom. Surely he has done all he could and followed the example of Our Master who has I trust received him</p>
