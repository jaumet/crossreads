  
 McCormack's (near Flers) we found that a large body of men were already engaged in the work.  It looked dangerous considering that the day was so clear and aircraft were busy.  As we expected, Fritz immediately commenced to throw shells round us so that we had to clear off back to Green Dump.  On the way back we were dodging numbers of shells.  Infantry were changing over at the time and some of these were killed or wounded.  5 infantry attached to us as stretcher bearers were killed.  Jim Lilly seriously wounded in head.  Palmer
