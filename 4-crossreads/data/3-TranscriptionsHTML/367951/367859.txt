Beat will you buy me a pair of mits and send over it is terrible cold there is times i can hardly fire my fingers are like if they are useless it has been raining so the trenches are in a fine state i got wet through the other evening on post and caught a rotten cold it was a sleet storm it used to hang to your clothes like ice i never saw any of it in my life before. Beat there is no more news we are holding a little more than our own with them do not forget the mits i have not had a letter from you yet hoping that i get one next mail.</p>
