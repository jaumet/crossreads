<p>boats &amp;  small steamers  &amp;  motor launches decorated with red, white &amp;  blue also flags waving  &amp;  flying about. It was a grand sight &amp; very funny the remarks of some of the men to their friends.. We were quite entertained for hours.<br/>We sailed at 12.40 p.m.  &amp;  the harbour was looking beautiful. We were enjoying nature but sorry when we were informed that  <u>Mess</u> was waiting for us, so we had to go down to lunch. After luncheon came up on deck  &amp;  had a lovely afternoon, talking &amp;  sewing. But my poor pal was feeling very ill. so had to lye down. Could not come down to afternoon tea. I am quite enjoying the trip, the weather is beautiful  &amp;  can see the coast all the time. The beach is a white sand  &amp; the cliffs are covered with green tree &amp; grass. Dorothy was too ill to come down to dinner, so has turned in, she has been very sick so may feel better after a while.<br/>The dining saloon looked very gay at dinner. The centre table was very bright with the officers in full dress uniform &amp;  the nurses in grey dress, red cap. badges &amp; white caps. No aprons, to save washing. Dr Webb. our Major. said he was quite proud of his staff, we all look such a healthy fine lot of women.</p>
