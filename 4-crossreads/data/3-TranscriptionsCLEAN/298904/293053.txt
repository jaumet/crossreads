generally 5 or 6 women & a dozen kids riding on a little donkey cart these seem the most least concerned of the whole lot, for I don't suppose it matters much to them, whether their lord & master is alive or dead, they have a dogs life, at the best of times  I have seen more than once a cow donkey, or camel, yoked with a woman to the plough, while the husband walks behind.If they are going to town & they have one donkey only it is the woman who walks, that is one of the weak points of Islam, the way they treat their women, it nearly got a lot of us into trouble several times, for it seems so funny to us
