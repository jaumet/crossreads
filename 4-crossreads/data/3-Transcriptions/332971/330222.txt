<p>purchase anything I want here.<br/>Yesterday a party of 50 of us went for a ride on camels &amp; donkeys across the desert to the Sakkara pyramids &amp; then to see some old Tombs which date back to 3000 years before Christ. When we started off at 9 a.m. it was fearfully windy &amp; dusty &amp; we experienced a dust storm in the desert. It made us realise what our boys went through on their long marches when they first came over. However it calmed down &amp; we enjoyed the novel outing immensely, but to-day most of us are stiff &amp; sore, but I was glad, it was such a good excuse to stay in and have a quiet time with you all, and I have enjoyed it even better than the outing. The mails must have been very irregular of late &amp; I am anxious to let you know that all is well.<br/>Tomorrow morning we South Australians are going to Miss Graham to get our Xmas parcels that were sent . She has been keeping them for us on account of us not being settled. This is the very last page of my diary &ndash; I lingeringly say farewell once again. The sun is sinking behind the pyramids. The girls are flocking back for dinner and I am thinking of bed &amp; hoping my dreams will visit you.<br/>Again thanking you &amp; loving you for all you have done.<br/>Sincerely yours -<br/>Anne Donnell.</p>
