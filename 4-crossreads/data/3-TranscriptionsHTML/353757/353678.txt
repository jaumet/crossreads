<p>I met Roy Smith, also Ted Larkin, who is in our company &amp; he wishes to be remembered to all at home.</p>
<p>I hope you get fixed up with a secretary.  I have had a bit of a conscience on that matter.  Anyhow &amp; can't say I am glad I came but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>With best wishes old boy;  would like to hear from you ere I leave if you can spare a minute.</p>
<p>Remember me kindly</p>
