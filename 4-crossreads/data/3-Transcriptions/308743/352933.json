<p>6 March 1915<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Revielle at 6.<br/>After stables I again went into Cairo &amp; did the round of trips, first to the Citadel, then to the O'dance where we got out rifle buckets at last. Weather very gusty &amp; plenty of dust. We got back at two pm, filled in the afternoon by sleeping, feed up at 5 pm mounted [indecipherable] for Corps Larkin &amp; Letch who were on leave to a friend of Berts, new phones had capsules replaced &amp; reported OK. Wrote home &amp; to Nell, my JAP celebrated its birthday today &amp; right glad am I to know the she is still OK, heard today that we are off to Turkey for certain as 160 interpreters are required &amp; we expect to receive our helmets any day now. News is very scarse just at present, &amp; we are looking forwart to the next mail.<br/>7 March 1915<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>Revielle at 6.<br/>Stables per usual then after first parade kit inspection when all kit other than that issued to you had to be confiscated or given away. After dinner Hal &amp; I went off to the terminus to meet our friends but they forgot to turn up so we put in the afternoon by looking up different friends on the balconies, came back to camp at 5 in time to see an operation on a house in the A.P.C. lines. After tea S.S.M. Coyne sent a letter to McCutcheon saying that Jock White, Jimmy Tongue, &amp; Pte White were killed in action about the 9th. S.S.M. Farrow with a lady called on us last night &amp; we spent a real enjoyable time for the lady was a real sport &amp; she saw through the red tape business of the [indecipherable] Troop. Bed at nine pm.</p>
