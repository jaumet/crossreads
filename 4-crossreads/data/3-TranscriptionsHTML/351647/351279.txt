<p>very long.  I am very well getting quite fat &amp; eating so well.  I like the job its so interesting but I wish the war would finish &amp; we could go home.  It is quite cold already.  I saw Brian &amp; Bert Macnamara they are well &amp; hearty &amp; send their love. <u>Their</u> stars haven't changed them &amp; I don't think will.  Letter writing is a precarious job, orderlies keep dodging in &amp; I have very little time to myself.  I haven't had any letters from you lately.  I sent you a Blighty with a lovely front page.  I hope you get it.  I thought of Graham when I saw it.  Now I must close.  I hope You'll forgive this scrappy note.  I'll write as soon as I can.  Love to the Boss &amp; Mac &amp; Graham &amp; <strike>all</strike> yourself from,</p>
<p>Yours as ever,<br/>Wilkie.</p>
