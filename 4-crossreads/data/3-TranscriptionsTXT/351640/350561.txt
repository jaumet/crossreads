My health is of the best enabling me to do my sixteen or eighteen hours in comfort daily.
Of 29-2-15 [29-12-15].  It was good to divide yourselves on Christmas day, and to meet in the evening.  Mrs. Macdonald was very good to you as was also Muriel.  My best wishes to both.  The framed photo of me will remind them now and then of an old chap far away who is much obliged to them.
My regards to Maria too, let me hope that she is happy and comfortable at Macquarie Street, it will be a change from lodgings, please ask her to convey my regards to Andy and his family.  Mrs. Franki & her family also, kindly messages from me.  Smart girl she is.  Tell Jimmy that were I at home some of his ham would have been eaten by me.  Good boy again!!!
