Pay day today, but im not in it as my book is a quidlet overdrawn. Guess it doesn't matter - seeing that I've got a fiver! The Doc is also out of it as his book is in England - also his wife!  Sentr  Alan McDougall is on board with us. He watched the Colonel dishing out our pay. Very few Hospital cases yet, so the Nurses & Doc's have plenty of leisure time. Beautiful sunset & a sea like glass
