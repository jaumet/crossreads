went for a stroll with Will after tea: Roger & Sault & A Coy's guard fell into the ditch dodging a shell:
Saturday June 24th billets: patchy showery day: up at 8 am: our guns bogged in a little during the early hours of morning: after I finished Tom, Nug, & I went almost in to Armentieres for a walk: After dinner Tom & I had one of our "eat ups": wrote to Et & sent P.C.s: plenty of shells kicking around: Alf went into the water dodging a shell: our guns opened up again towards midnight & Fritz returned as per usual: Seen a dual & a fokker made a beautiful dive at a plane but missed him:
Sunday June 25th Billets: good day: the reputation for shells was well kept up & we were chased out of our billets in the morning: he was after our "big how is its" & landed first shell almost on them but of course did not know his luck: communion at 9.am & very nice: after dinner aeros were up like flies & bombed Fritz's sausages: the bombs bursting in some big clouds made a pretty effect, just like weeping stuff falling from the clouds: nine of our planes were in a bunch & with the big thunder clouds as a background looked well. A Fritz was up so two of our "fighters" chased him & tried to bomb him & the bombs looked pretty bursting in the clouds: Fritz bogged in to the trenches a lot & our guns did a good bit of firing all day: after tea we had church in the barn & it went well: we had another "Kentucky" tea party & it was tra-bong: our guns opened up a heavy bombardment about 11.30 pm as our raid was on: It was a pretty sight to see the rockets going up & the flashes of the guns & explosions: Fritz got a rough passage all right: he replied pretty hotly but I believe we worked our "knut" this time in the trenches & came off light:
