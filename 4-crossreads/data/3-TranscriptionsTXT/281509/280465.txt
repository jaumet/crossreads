 Day breaks wet &amp; stormy. Nothing doing in morning. Hut leaks during night. 22 men packed in these low pig sheds 3"no bon".especially when it get swamped. However its the joys of a soldier's life. Are taken on another march for want of something better to do. Walked 6 miles thro' driving wind &amp; rain. All get thoroughly soaked &amp; have to remain in wet clothes. Uncomplimentary remarks re officers by men &amp; with reason. Tea &amp;amp retire early.
