Rations are, indeed very short We left Green Dumps about 12 and came out to McCormacks Post just before we left the cry went up \"Fall in for Mail\"  There was a Holy Rush and as each man got his letters, a beautiful smile broke out and lit his face like sunshine. If only our people at Home could see a mail being distributed it would do their hearts good. I got 6 letters, 1 from France, 1 Mother, and 4 from M.S. and a Photo and P.C.
