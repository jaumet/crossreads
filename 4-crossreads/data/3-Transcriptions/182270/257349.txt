<p>THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine, but dull. Went down</p>
<p>to Horseferry R<sup>d</sup>&nbsp;in morning</p>
<p>and got an indefinite extension</p>
<p>of leave. Went round with Alan</p>
<p>in afternoon. A mob of us</p>
<p>had dinner at Les Lauriers</p>
<p>and had a box at &quot;Hello America&quot;</p>
<p>afterwards.</p>
