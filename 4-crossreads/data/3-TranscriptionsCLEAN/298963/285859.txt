Jerry came over to see me but Joe got hold of him while I was fixing up the cricketing material.  The light is bad & I can hardly see to write now.  He often comes over now with news of Alf & Harry.  Poor old Alf he got his wish after all - a boy from a good home who never wanted for anything.  I knew him when in Hospital, he was anxious then to come up with the boys.  He got his wish, & now he lies in hospital - dying they say -
