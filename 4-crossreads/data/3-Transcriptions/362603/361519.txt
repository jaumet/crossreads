<p>2.  Pals.  This Laurie was sent Here for Duty about 6 months ago amp; we have taken to one another quite a lot.  He comes from the North Coast.<br/>I was sorry to hear about poor Jessie Sheldon.  Give Her my kind Regards.  She is one of the 30 to whom I owe letters.  I will write as soon as possible.  I do not think that Jennie's Father boozes too much.  He takes a drink but that is nothing. Auntie Annie is a bonnie one, Mum.  Oh! I'll never rest content till I get Her to come to Australia to live.<br/>I am glad to learn that you have quite a lot of visitors.  I see that you have dropped Ida for the prettier name of Nette.  Ida is rather a harsh name for a Girl.<br/>There aught to be quite a gathering of the Clans at Nance's Home.  It should be nice.  I dreamt some months ago that there was a wedding at their Home &amp; there was gathered together the whole "dam" Family.  What a rotten crowd there must have been</p>
