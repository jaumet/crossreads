 No 3 AGH [Following paragraph crossed out] Sisters to wash me   Clean Sheets Same old CHART I know the Routine well.  My 3rd time wounded in under a month. I hope to go to England.  Very stiff and sore but am truly thankful to be alive I'm not what you call a religious man, but I do believe &amp; have faith in some higher power. I am in bed &amp; looking at Hops Pictures in the Bulletin of Killing Turks make me laugh till my broken rib sticks in. Our Armenian Interpreters have the time of their lives bossing up the prisoners riding up &amp; down the ranks shouting orders like Generals- still they come 2500 &amp; 45 German officers.
