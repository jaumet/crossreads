<p>Butler, our tired man has gone to Kantara to interview the O/C Flying Corps with a view to transferring he will be gone several days. Just heard on the news that Sir Phillip Chetwood got "Strafed" for not notifying General Head Quarters that he was going to smash things up at Maghdaba. General Sir Archibald Murray the Commander-in-Chief has given him a "wigging". Anyhow we did good work and Sir Phillip Chetwood is as I thought a real live Cavalry leader one with some push and go. Young and vigorous not a fossilized old fogey of the antequated old School. He will do us for a Commander If the report is true we should be sorry to hear it<br/>Paid Jimmy Probert for the Kodak &pound;2.<br/>Hooray! An issue of fresh meat &amp; vegetables At last! There's corn in Egypt yet.</p>
<p>6th January El Arish 1916. Saturday<br/>Mounted troops about one Brigade have just arrived from somewhere. They are making down to the South probably going to make their camp there ready for the "Push". I felt very feverish last night and my temperature was over 100 &deg; Feel a little better this morning Fresh meat for breakfast welcome change Part of the line washed away during recent rains and a supply train fell off the line the other day &ndash; 2.30 pm &ndash; Just had a Taube scare. A Taube flying at about 10,000 feet passed over here and was making for some of the places back</p>
