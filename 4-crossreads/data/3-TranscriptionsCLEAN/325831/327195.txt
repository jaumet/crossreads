 Dear Senator Pearce 
 It was very good of you to let me see this correspondence. Thank you for that & for all your kindness. 
 In view of the interest you have been good enough to take in my boy, I should like you to read the enclosed extracts from two of his letters to his mother & myself. The first was in answer to a letter from me in which I told him that I thought he might possibly be offered some kind of Staff appointment, & left him to do as he thought right. 
 With kind regards 
 Yours very sincerely
