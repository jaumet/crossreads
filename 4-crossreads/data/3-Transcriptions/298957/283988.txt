<p>A number of huge water tanks are erected near the infantry lines, into which water is pumped from Rail Head.</p>
<p>5th April (Wednesday)<br/>Hot Day. I was put on a carpentry job while the others re-arranged the tents to make the camp look more compact. When the infantry arrived here the New Zealanders who handed the camp over gave all the water that was left in the tanks and went without it themselves &ndash; Another good turn.</p>
<p>6th April (Thursday) Nothing</p>
