There is still very heavy artillery firing up the lines, I hear tonight that our 4 th Div. captured 1100 prisoners the Guards are supporting them.
They are paying the boys tonight so I expect there will be plenty of drunks knocking about by bed time
11 th. Early this morning the whole Coy. were called out on fatigue. I had 40 men 4 NCOs in my party, our work was digging incinerators building bunks in the billets.
We are living pretty high in the "Mess" roast beef potatoes green peas etc followed by a fruit pie or something similar porridge steak for breakfast a good tea at night
We are losing Freddie Turner today we are all sorry in one way
