<p>My Life In The Army<br/>I am a New Zealander by birth and resided in Victoria for six years prior to the war. I enlisted in Bendigo Sept. 30th 1916 and on the 24th of Oct. of that year found myself on the boat Ulysis en route for the front. At Park Hill Salisbury plain I went through my drill.<br/>After being there 2 months, Bronchitis sent me to Hosp. Fargo.<br/>In May 1917 I was drafted to France found the 5 batt. A.I.F. at Flennincourt Wood. They were resting there for three months. Mt first "baptism" was at Ypres, Polygon Wood was one of the objectives that fell into the hand of the Australians during the time that my Unit was in this portion of the Menin Road Sector. Behind the attacking waces of infantry the Engineers party, to which I was temporarily attached, were subjected to severe barrages and suffered many casualties. I was twice blown up with small shells from quick firers called "whiz-bangs" but was lucky enough not to be shell-shocked from the effects of concussion.<br/>Some of the incidents in connection with this first experience are noted in my Dairy as follows.<br/>Bombs, gas Wind-up shock baptism<br/>My most vivid and lasting impressions of experiences in this war are in and around Ypres. That is the place where the German hordes made their first and continued attacks to break through the British lines. There gas was first used by them on the Canadians</p>
