 Dear Sir I desire to acknowledge the receipt of two parcels containing 62 pairs of socks. Please convey to your splendid army of workers our sincere thanks. Later on the boys will write and thank the ladies who enclosed messages. Just now we are away on a "flying column" but our isolation from our base makes your splendid gift more than ever acceptable 
 Best wishes for the coming year to all at the 1st L.H. Comforts dept. Yours sincerely W.J. Ahearn, Lt O.C. No 1 Section M.G. Sqd. 1 A.L.H.
