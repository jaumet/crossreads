a Belgian, a big, tall, rosy-cheeked lass, blue-eyed---clean-minded-nice girl---but rough compared with our own city girls of Australia.
Friday, 26.Usual routine.
Saturday, 27.Orderly Sergeant for day. We commence to shift to the old infantry "humpies" situated in the orchard at L'Estrade---nearer to Office. It is a very ragtime shift. Went to baths. Trouble with Bdr. Boag and Campion. Warned them for Orderly.
Sunday. 28.Nearly everything shifted. We have the afternoon off. I wrote a little, but slept till stables---under a cherry tree in the orchard.
Monday 29.At Menegatte C. Sub had covered in stables, but here the whole battery horse lines are in the open---two lines, one for each section. Usual routine. Hauled out of bed at 9.30pm. to supply two teams and accompany the Left Section---four teams in all-to Gun Pits. Cpl. Waters to take four teams to Right Section. Night---drizzling rain intensely dark, was highly strung---it was my first trip into the unknown. The strafe had been heavy all day. Went right to the Pits themselves. Returned 4.am.
Tuesday, 30.Morning in bed---slept till 10.30am. Had to attend Orderly Room to give evidence re Boag and Campion.
Wednesday, 31.Usual. Went into Steenwerk for tea with Prouse---pate, eggs, chips and coffee. In a butcher's shop where we got the pate I saw the most exquisite type of face and hands I have seen in France.
