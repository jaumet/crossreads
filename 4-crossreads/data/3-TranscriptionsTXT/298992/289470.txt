 Well, Mother its not often I am stuck for news, but I really have nothing to tell you just now. Am quite well, and feeling ready for anything that happens along. Have written often to Joan &amp; Dulcie &amp; received a long letter from Aunt Soph, a few weeks ago. Coleridge dropped in to see me lately, he is in the 45th Battalion. Remember me to any enquirers &amp; tell Bill I hope he is always a good boy &amp; never gives you any trouble. Many Happy Returns of 17th June for Hazel, &amp; you can get her something nice for me. 
 Heaps of Love to all the family, 
 Your loving son 
 Alan.
