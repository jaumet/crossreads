 I do hope &amp; trust that my letters to you have not conveyed such an impression.  Correspondence of this nature must always be personal &amp; privileged, &amp; I do hope that my letters, though they cannot reduce your loss &amp; grief may have , perhaps, given some little comfort to you. With kindest regards Believe me, Yours very sincerely W.L.H. Burgess Bg. Gen.
