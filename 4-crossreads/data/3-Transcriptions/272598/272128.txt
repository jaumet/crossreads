<p>a fine town, but now awfully knocked about owing to continuous heavy bombardment.  Leaning steeple of church a great land mark.  Our Q.M. paid us a visit to take a list of shortages.  Losing a few of our old Officers.</p>
<p>Friday 10.11.16<br/>Very heavy bombardment going on, on front where we have just come from.  On road repair work again.  Any amount of peace rumours flying about.</p>
<p>Saturday 11.11.16<br/>Wrote home.  Still on roads.  Weather has been fine for the past couple of days.  Fritz unexpectedly shelled us here to-night, caused quite a stir among the majority in camp.</p>
<p>Sunday 12.11.16<br/>Church parade at 10 AM.  Cleaned up</p>
