<p>Went to Cairo on duty in the afternoon and had a fine dinner on my own.  I went to Ezbekiya Gardens and picked up with a swiss lady &amp; her daughter, but had to converse in french.</p>
<p>Then I went to O'Bs for tea and spent the evening .  they are splendid friends &amp; always make me welcome it is great to sit down to a real table and speak in English and eat decently.  Our food is getting very poor &amp; scanty and I have more meals at the canteen than at the messroom.</p>
