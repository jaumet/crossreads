<p>Alf got a tin of biscuits from Scotland &amp; they went well too: "stood to" all night as the 7th affair was to come off: it started at 11.15 with a terrific bombardment from our guns on both salients &amp; all along between: Fritz sent up double red rockets &amp; red "showers" &amp; soon his guns were bogging in a treat: it was awful &amp; the big howitzer high explosives were terrible: the concussion, smell of the powder, etc &amp; the heat of the explosions were beyond discription I observed from 11.30 pm to 12 midnight &amp; the scene between the trenches was magnificent: flares were up from everywhere &amp; Fritz was landing shrap &amp; shell between the trenches to repel the attack he thought was on : The larger shells banged into our trenches &amp; the escapes were marvellous: How anyone escapes at all beats me as there were bombs all kind of shells bullets dirt &amp; a mix up of everything flying about:</p>
<p>Wednesday June 7th <br/>trenches: "Hell" still let loose: It finished about 1.15 am: Mr Lowther stayed in our bay most of the time &amp; we picked out gun positions: The bay next to us was blown in &amp; Lowther and I pulled the bags away as we thought Higgs was underneath but thank goodness he was not: poor old Fid &amp; J Clark were blown about badly but it must have been a merciful though horrible death: I offered up a prayer for strength &amp; am sure it was answered: we were all badly rattled by the concussion etc: after it ended we set to to repair next door but our artillery opened up again for five minutes &amp; Fritz replied but it soon died down again: This is not war: men are not made to face these big shells. The lord is indeed</p>
