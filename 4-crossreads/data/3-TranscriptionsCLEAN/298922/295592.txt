Monday 8th October 1917
Halted at VOGHERA after travelling all night, had a wash & breakfast. It is a great struggle to get any rest as the carriages are full & no sleepers. We get Army Rations issued, but buy CHIANTI, eggs, etc. & a very good sparkling wine SPUMATI which is cheap. 34250 LIRE go to the English pound. At TURIN we halted for 2 hours & went to the town, bought a bird & bottle for tea. The Alps are all around & covered with Snow, a pretty spot - Electric train from here.
