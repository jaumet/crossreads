<p>My dearest Mother   &amp;  Sisters.,</p>
<p>Did I tell you that I got two letters from home this week. Belle's of June 3rd   &amp;    <strike>Alice's of </strike>  June 24th which I was delighted at getting. I know the family would be very pleased to see you back. So glad you had such   a happy time   &amp;  look better for your change. You will all miss Eddy very much, does he go all day   &amp;  come home for dinner? Who takes him   &amp;  brings  him home? Of course I'm very anxious to know all about the darling boy.</p>
<p>I wonder if there is anything</p>
