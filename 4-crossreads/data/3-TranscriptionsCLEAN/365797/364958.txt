  
 Are insects bad in France? 
 News all points in one favour just now but somehow I can't believe that the Germans will give down suddenly. There will be heavy fighting before they are driven out of Belgium & we all feel quite disappointed that Mr. Hughes has not brought in cons-cription so that the men may all be in training at once & ready to send along in the early spring. 
 We are very quiet now during week ends & I am trying to get the house in order after the mix up that Dene had. 
 Good night dear; we are hoping for a letter by tomorrow's mail. With love from us all 
 Mother.
