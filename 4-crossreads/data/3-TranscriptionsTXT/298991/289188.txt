Tuesday July 10thWord came back that my leave was turned down, so all my made up plans are now squashed. I never said a word either when they put my name up on the "not approved" list, & still believe the proper person never saw it, never mind I will put in again later. Three of us here go down to the Salvation Army or Y.M.C.A hut every evening now & have supper, we are coming out some, I can tell you. I have met a good few fellows I knew in France, over here, most of them have been wounded.
Wednesday July 11thToday was the first day I have gone for a walk out of camp, it was only then a chap wanted to purchase some goods down at Shipton village, & he persuaded me to go for a walk with him. Everyone who receives over 14 days detention here is sent to Wandsworth, on the Isle of Wight to complete his term.
Thursday July 12thPad day, I did not draw any for myself, but drew 2 for a pal who is on leave. We are having lovely weather here now. The Russians on the Eastern Front have appeared to wake up, they have started "pushing".
