 20 Aug, 1916 Hot Summer Nights "From the Bully" Dead ring for old "Coogee" 
 Hot summer nights;  Hot summer nights! The beach &ndash; a splash; soft tarts in tights; A glow of distant city lights; Ti-tree in silhouette; a white pearl sky; Oceans of lovers, lovers pass my eye; Soft, shaded grass; pale, shining sands; Romantic sighs; holding of hands; White tracks, with stealing shades of trees; Sweet scents of earth; a gentle breeze;  A glimmer of white; a sigh, a sneeze; Full lips of red, a kiss, a squeeze;  A stealthy voice, a laugh, a rustling skirt, A world of whispers, &amp; the world aflirt. My oath, hot nights Hot tarts in tights Hot views, hot sighs &ndash; Real hot, my oath! Hot summer nights!
