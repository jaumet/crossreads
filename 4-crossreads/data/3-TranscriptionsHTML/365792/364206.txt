<p>May 1 is a favourite saying of Tommies &amp; Canadians</p>
<p>2 Several cases came in last night, some suffering from gas. Appears that Fritz has been using gas all along the line. Wonder when our guns will open up, &amp; our mines begin to roar? During my short 6 days <u>in</u>, they hardly spoke at all &ndash; despite the fact that the Huns shelled our reserves &amp; supports every day, &amp; got a fair number two &ndash; including some munitions &amp; a gun or two. Can't understand why civies are allowed so close to the firing line, because half of them are spies, in the pay of the Hun. Rather heavy rain this mng, accompanied by thunder &amp; lightening, but its over now &amp; everythings beautifully cool. A fellow cant wander far in this Caboose, why, if you even go near the gate an MP is sure to go crook, &amp; I told one of em off t'other day, but don't spose that helped any.</p>
