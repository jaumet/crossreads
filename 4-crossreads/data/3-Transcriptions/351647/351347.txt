<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>I can't write a letter &amp; I haven't had a show to write for weeks but you must forgive my seeming neglect as I really can't help it.  We have been going like mad &amp; its been very windy &amp; dusty &amp; also very hot.  I think we are leaving Egypt soon &amp; I'm not sorry.  I don't know where we are going or when exactly but I hear we can't write for weeks so I thought I'd better warn you.  I saw Dr. Lethbridge on Sunday, he wants me to try &amp; change into something less strenuous</p>
