Ghezira had orders to prepare for 1000 cases, At Alier increased it capacity from 400 to 1200, all others emptying &amp; putting in extra beds. Luna Park putting up tents also. Helouan discharged 400 Conv's. Rumour &amp; speculation very rife. Rumours state that Lone Pine trenches blown up as well as other positions &amp; that our chaps are getting a bad time. Speculation is wondering if that's true or if our chaps are withdrawing or have assumed another offensive. Hope it's the latter.
