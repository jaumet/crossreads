March 23rd  at 6 PM.we departed for Granada. March 24th at dawn we arrived and anchored off Granada, during the forenoon we got under weigh and carried our sub-calibre firing for [indecipherable] S.G. anchoring off the town at 11.15 am. March 25th We were all very disappointed at our visit to Granada, because it was our first visit here and we all naturally expected leave, but this did not materialise, so we did not even have a glimpse of the town - but the island which appeared hilly was very fertile and picturesque - At 6 PM we weighed anchor and proceeded towards Venezuela and neighbouring islands
