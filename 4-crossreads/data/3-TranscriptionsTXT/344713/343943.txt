 Thurs. April 5th: - Left Fremicourt &amp; went further east to Velu &amp; bivouaced under tarpaulins in wood outside. There has been big German horse lines here. 
 Frs. April. 6th: - Shifted along road to midway between Yelu &amp; Bertincourt &amp; re-erected our shanties. 
 Mon. April 9th: - Shifted along cross railway line (absolutely stripped even of the sleepers by "Fritz") &amp; on to Hermies which village the 2nd &amp; 3rd Bns. took early this morning. We are awaiting a counter-attack. 
 Tues. April. 10th: - Situation absolutely quiet &amp; no artillery fire. Funny kind of weather &ndash; Sunshine one moment &amp; Snow the next. Good Country around here but not much material to fix up a decent camp. This is Easter time &amp; there is no chance of getting a letter away or buying a cigarette. 
 Wed. April. 11th: - Moved along to Coys headquarters on Sunken road at side of Demicourt relieving the 1st. Bn. Our line is comprised of outposts. Snowing &amp; things in general are miserable &ndash; not much shelter.
