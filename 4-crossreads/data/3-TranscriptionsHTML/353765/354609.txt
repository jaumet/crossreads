Taube heard &amp; advice of same received from Oghratina. Not seen from our camp but about 7.30 Taube &amp; our plane both sighted.

Both M.G.s were rattling at each other, the Taube appearing to do the more firing.<br/>29th &ndash; First air duel (decent) that we had seen. Taube seemed to be the faster &amp; seemed as if our 'plane had outmanoeuvred it. Taube drew away from ours. Later we heard news which was confirmed that our plane had been brought down at Hamadieh &amp; also stated that taube appeared very warbly &amp; flying low &amp; seemed as if hit. Not seen to land so nothing definite known as to its fate. <strike>Fa</strike> Our plane brought to Railhead &amp; it is said had 53 holes in it, the petrol pipe being broken.<br/>[Note in margin:] Friday<br/>Reports say that our plane hit by our M.G. Everything getting fixed up for the stunt. Bearers &amp; camels expect to move out 'tween 12m &amp; 2 am Parade with iron rations. Only two had them, self &amp; Strachen. Paid today.</p>
