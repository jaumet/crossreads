not seem very long, & one can hardly realise that a year has flown by. Most of that time has been spent in France, for we are here over 6 months, about 4 months was spent in England & a little over 7 weeks on the water coming over. During this past year I have seen a lot of the world, have been under fire, have had some good times, and also suffered a lot of hardships.When I left Victoria I thought the war would be over by now, in fact when I left England I thought it would be near a finish now, but I fully believe it will go on right through this Summer & finish about the end of it or perhaps in the Autumn. I will be lucky to get home in time for christmas.There was a lot of heavy bombardment last night & again today. This afternoon it increased to great intensity, clouds of smoke rising, and a continual roar.After tea one of our planes had a fight with one of Fritz's or fell in his fires, with a wing broken, turning over & over as it fell.There were 12 of our observation baloons up this evening & 5 of Fritz's.
