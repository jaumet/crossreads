<p>The desolation of the Somme Battlefield surpasseth imagination. Of the fertile fields &amp; pretty villages of Fricourt. Bicourt. Contal Maison. Montauban. Trones Wood. Longueville barely one stone lays on another.&nbsp; Just a heap of ruins beaten into pulpy dust&nbsp; Searching amid the ruins I have found a pair of Corsets.&nbsp; A silk garter &amp; a baby&#39;s</p>
