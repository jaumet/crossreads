27th. Saturday
Rec?d Rations left Steenwerk on foot about 8am. reaching Billet (Bois Grenier) at noon. Rec?d 20 letters was very glad as since leaving London I was awfully homesick especially not knowing anyone much to travel with. They absolutely spoiled me made life seem so miserable again for following days. I was much relieved when I got back with the boys.
