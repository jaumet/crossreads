22.12.15were transferred onto the the troopship Hororata & a beauty she is too they were expecting us on board early & had dinner ready for us but as we did not turn up it was thrown overboard, we made the best of a bad job & had some dry bread & a little later some soup was brought along there is something like 2000 troops aboard the majority I believe are New Zealander MR  the whole of the 1st LH Bde are on board;
About 40 bags of mail turned up for the 1st L.H. Regt last night but only one or two bags were sorted out before we left. The remainder is with us at present; Everyone in great spirits in anticipation of once more getting back to civilisation but the old Gallipoli Peninsula gave me the best time I have had since I enlisted & glad we all are to leave Lemnos behind us
