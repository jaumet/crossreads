are to be in Moascar on the 1st Nov.  I wonder.  However it is very nice to hear.
23.10.18Nothing official has come out officially 'de re '14' but the Xmas mail has to be in by Nov. 1st & they say that there is a boat going on the 9th from Suez.  So if there is anything in it at all we ought to hear in a few days.  Personally I am afraid it is a fable or there would have been something official out about it by now.  At present we are back at the Station at Amman.  They say that we are moving shortly but I can see no signs of it at present.  Tonight it has clouded over & it has rained a little during the afternoon
