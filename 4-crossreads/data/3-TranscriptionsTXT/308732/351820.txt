still hung there, this wall goes right round the old town & we went through a similar gate on the other side. The old sports who built the wall would have stared if they could have seen the armed Australians marching through their gates. When our train came along, it was an extremely lone one & all (except one carriage for Officers) built like our trucks you put your eggs &  fowls in, only a bit larger, to carry "Chevaux 8 et hommes 40" which means 8 horses or 40 men, on the train were a motley crowd, French, British, American, Canadian & Australian soldiers, and Chinese laborers. In our particular carr car we were lucky as we only had about half the number in that we should have had.
