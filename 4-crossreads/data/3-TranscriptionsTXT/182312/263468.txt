 of having huge boulders rolled down onto them.

 being washed away.&nbsp; This gives the whole country side a corrugated 
 appearance.&nbsp; Apart from everyday necessities in the way of vegetables

 the appearance of these olives which are small and blackish I should 
 imagine that they would be used mainly for oil making and not for table
