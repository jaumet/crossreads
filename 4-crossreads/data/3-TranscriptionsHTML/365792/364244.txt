<p>14 <u>Some</u> winter weather this Wonder what Dad would think of it. Sue uses the room in which he was born. Little did I think a couple of years Since that I would ever set eyes on England, let alone come right here. On the way down from Cheltenham I noticed several familiar names which I had often heard at home. On the other hand we passed (on the Bristol line) the town of Tamworth &amp; I felt almost inclined to get out &amp; pay a visit to the Office, but <u>that Office</u> is over 12,000 miles away from here.<br/>The Wesleyan Chapel just opposite is dated 1858, so it must have been built before Dads time. Had a good look round, inspected the C of E &amp; the graveyard. The Church is very old &ndash; having been built in 1300 &amp; it has all the latest improvements, "heaters etc" Saw Grandmothers &amp; Grandfathers graves &ndash;</p>
