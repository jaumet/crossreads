This magnificent Arch we examined with the greatest interest. It is inscribed with the names of all Napoleon's generals in each of his wars & all his victories among which I noticed Ypres the scene of so much in the present war. Walking from Arch de Triomphe through Champs Elysees & Place de la Concorde to the Madeleine, a beautiful church with an exquisite interior lavishly adorned with white sculptings.
A short walk brought us to Restaurant de l'Opera where for 7 francs each we had an excellent dinner. After a visit by tube to Gare du Nord we promenaded from Opera to Republique visiting a Cinema on the road.
