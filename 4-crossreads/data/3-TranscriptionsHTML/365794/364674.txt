<p>Friday 28 September 1917<br/>Long rollers and still our boat pitches and rolls sufficiently to send all patience cards off the table just as one has a game almost won.<br/>Bright moon and the sea weird and uncanny with the sky &amp; ocean a misty gray and the sea like oil and soundless.  Another visit paid to our cabin trunks and more treasures brought to light.  We get practically no news per wireless.  Always the British are gaining ground in France but what about Russia concluding a separate peace with Germany as we heard a week ago?<br/>One longs for some home news and when will be that?</p>
