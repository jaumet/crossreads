<p>[Letter from John Butler's cousin Charles Bean to John Butler's mother Amy]<br/>Gallipoli<br/>May 28 1915</p>
<p>Dear Aunt Amy<br/>I saw John yesterday. I was curiously enough just going up to see him that same afternoon. I heard his regiment had some sharp work to do the other day &ndash; but it wasnt his squadron that had been engaged in it. He has got put on to signal work &ndash; the telephone &amp; telegraph work for his regiment &amp; so was able to get down to the beach &amp; came up to see me. He was looking very well, &amp; told me he was living well &amp; was pretty comfortable. He was short of socks but I had a surplus luckily &amp; was able to let him have some. He has seen a fair amount of fighting &ndash; the place where they put his regiment at first was a very ticklish corner &ndash; where the enemy's trenches were quite close &amp; they had to get bombs thrown at them. One bomb wounded a sergeant who was next him. On another occasion Jack and another man were put into a trench which actually joined our trench with a Turkish one, &amp; had to keep watch on the Turkish section of it from behind some sandbags which divided the two.</p>
<p>I suppose the Turks (if they were in it then) were not more than 3 yards away.</p>
<p>John showed me a photo of Nancy &amp; some of Joan &amp; Claud &amp; Vida Edwards. I suppose Joan will be quite changed by the time we get back.</p>
<p>I will try &amp; keep an eye on Jack &ndash; I go up that way occasionally &amp; he comes down to the beach (now that he is out of the firing line &amp; on the telephone) for a bathe sometimes. Tell Joan we have our beach too, but no breakers &ndash; we dont want breakers either &ndash; might damage our biscuits &amp; get salt water in the jam.</p>
<p>Love to Nancy &amp; Joan &amp; Claud &amp; to yourself.<br/>Chas</p>
