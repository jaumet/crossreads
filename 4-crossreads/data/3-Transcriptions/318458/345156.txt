<p>Addendum &ndash; Prayers</p>
<p>It is with special interest I recalled the morning prayers on the day of action.  As usual, the Bugle sounded for Prayers on Monday 9th Nov. at 9.5.  I always read from the R.A.N. service book which I supplemented after by the Collect for the Day from the Prayer Book or a passage of scripture to give variety.  This day, seeing that we were then doing high speed with the possibility of something happening before long, I approached Captain Glossop just before I began to read asking him the question, shall I read the prayer before Battle, Sir?  He replied in a confidential subdued "Yes".  Thus, after the usual preliminary prayers, this historic prayer before Battle was read before the Ship's company for the first time in Australian Naval history.  Often, in speaking of the action before audiences since, I have mentioned the above incident and [indecipherable] frequent reference [indecipherable].</p>
