<p>December 24<br/>7.<br/>Charleroi in the night, an estasy of purple great lamps, and a hundred great glowing lights, exquisitively hazed like frozen hung flares in the thin thread <strike>haze</strike> mist of rain:  and the cobbles each individually gleaming and black masses silvered by the lights filling the lorry crowded square.</p>
<p>Today Arthur C. in after presents for Madame and Mdslle &ndash; two lace collars and scent from 'Maps' and the C.C. office people.</p>
<p>No Mail:  and all day cancelling and re-arranging, grouting and gutzing:  But the promise is goods!</p>
<p>December 26<br/>8.<br/>A night that ended in a candlelight procession through Presles and to the Chateau courtyard, carolling Hark The Herald Angles Sing! &ndash; closely followed, sung well with tears, "How Dry We Are".  Then to a "Resuscitation" at the A.D.M.S. and to our Maisonette to bed in the small hours, and the night still and a high sparsely starr'd sky.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning with Maurie through the wood for Ivy and Miseletoe:  the afternoon decorating and arranging the Estaminet:  vast excitement in the villiage and a hundred [indecipherable] sightseers.</p>
