These Fusiliers have plenty of machine Guns with them and they gave Fritz a lively time last night. We didn't have a single casualty and slept peacefully. Bert Hunt "Snowy" cooked the bacon for breakfast and made quite a decent stew for "dinner, about 11 a.m. a party of N.F.'s were fixing up a machine Gun when a Hun sniper got a Sergeant and a private, both shot in the head. The private named Frith got off lucky, but poor Serg. Dash died almost as they carried him into the DS. His brains were splashed all over Frith's helmet. Stan Wright's Birthday. He brought a jar of beer back and we celebrated the event in our Dug-out. The Col. Paid us a visit this morning, but did not stay long. Our aeroplanes fly over Fritz's trenches in dozens, and it is quite amusing to see the amount of ammunition Fritz wastes in trying to bring them down. We were issued with leather gloves this morning to protect our knuckles in these narrow snaps.

Quiet night again, no casualties. Our machine Gunners spotted a German working party, and let ?em have it, thick and Hot Murp" changed places with Roy Knowles, so" Roy is among the Dinkums " again. Not a single casualty all day. They expected a Gas Attack last night but Fritz didn't send any over. Wrote to France. We cleaned our dug out, out this morning. The place is alive with mice and rats. Scores of cats are here after the rats and between them they make an awful mess. The huns have got the range of the sap leading to the Guards dug out, next door to ours. The machine gun and a snipers bullets whizz by uncomfortably close and it's a case of "keep your head low" Stan Wright and I were returning from taking in a sick N.F. and had almost reached our D.S. when a bullet struck a tree and spashed on to Wrighty's helmet. I felt myself all over.
