<p>My dear Mr Ellis,</p>
<p>I have only today learned, through official channels of the death of your son, No 1114 Pte. Arthur Raymond Ellis, and I hasten to express my very sincere regret. Your son left us on May 12th I am informed that he died of Anaemia at the No 32 Stationary Hospital on June 7th. His body was buried in the Wimereux Cemetery.</p>
<p>Your son was always a most reliable soldier, and carried out his duties in a willing and cheerful manner. I can speak only in the highest terms of his character, &amp; of his conduct during the whole time he was with the Battalion. We all mourn his death.</p>
<p>Officers, non-commissioned-officers &amp; men all join me in offering you &amp; your family most heartfelt sympathy in your sad bereavement.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,<br/>Leslie J. Morshead.<br/>Lieut-Colonel.</p>
