 [Letter from Brig. General Charles Rosenthal] Head Quarters 9th Aust. Inf. Brigade April 19th 1918 
 My dear Mr Garling I was dreadfully shocked to hear yesterday that your son Terence had died of wounds. Though expressions of sympathy at such a time may seem and are unavailing I should like you and Mrs Garling to know how very sincerely I mourn his loss with you. From what I knew of him and from what you have told me in your letter you have lost a splendid son, I have lost a personal friend, and the A.I.F. a very gallant Soldier. 
 I am sure that in your grief the knowledge that he laid down his life for his country and a just cause will keep &amp; sustain you and your wife. 
 As you are doubtless aware I have for some months been with the Infantry so for some time past have had no opportunity of seeing your son. 
 Please accept my kindest regards Very Sincerely Yours 
 Charles Rosenthal
