<p>to declare war on Germany, the Japanese fleet is on the way to Tsingtau."- still more news but nothing good.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12/8/14<br/>The trip to the rendezvous of the squadron (where I do not know) is continued. Still heavy seas. Otherwise nothing worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Thursday 13/8/14<br/>At 6 pm. We arrive at the rendesvous, the small Caroline Island &ndash; Pagan. The first to meet us is the convoy of the squadron "-----". We circled the island. There lay in a bay "Scharnhorst", "Geneisenau", "Nurenberg" and 10 to 15 coal &amp; provision steamers. As we sail into the bay we are received with great cheers. The commander and his adjutant board the "Scharnhorst" immediately to report.</p>
