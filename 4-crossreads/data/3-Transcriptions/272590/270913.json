<p>Electrolytic Poetry.<br/>If the gas is out, the maiden said, then would the electric light?<br/>That's something I can't tell said I, although perhaps it might.<br/>Well, if a farmer mows his lawn, what does a dynamo?<br/>Again I shook my helpless head and said I didn't know.<br/>I've often wondered, she remarked, how much the coffee urns?<br/>As much, said I, as the fuel costs, that a fireless cooker burns.<br/>But why, she asked, when it's full of dust, is the vacuum cleaner?<br/>Why that's the same, I then explained, as a fat girl who is Lena.<br/>For quite some time I rambled on with daffodils forlorn,<br/>While alack, I turned around, and found the maid had gone.</p>
<p>War Bread<br/>Monday's bread is dark in hue.<br/>Tuesday's bread is tough to chew.<br/>Wednesday's bread is worse than coke.<br/>Thursday's bread makes papa choke.<br/>Friday's bread's like ammunition.<br/>After Saturday's bread you call in the physician.<br/>But the bread that is brought on the Sabbath day,<br/>Is enough to make any old atheist pray.</p>
