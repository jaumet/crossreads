<p>12th<br/>We had our Sports Meeting this morning at 10 A.M. Major Trickey presiding.  I was appointed executive for the Committee.</p>
<p>13th<br/>We commenced training though not for the Sports at which many of the men were very much disappointed.  I spent all the afternoon making a football ground, clearing it of rubbish and filling in shell holes.</p>
