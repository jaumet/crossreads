 Not much improvement last night & today. Its a crook place to be crook in. This is when one misses home  The boys attention is rough but kindly. My bingy rejects all food.  The Doc. has a look at me on the afternoon orders me back to Edward's Post. Ticketed Gastric Enteritis. Arrive back at Edward's Post about 4 p m found Ridgway & Sergt Clifton had been sent down to Bazentin.  Hunt keeps me here & doses me up.  Turn in to bunk in dugout & put in most joy.
