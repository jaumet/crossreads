  
 Balloch is on the shores of Loch Lomond.  The trip takes 21/2 hours and is right along the  River Clyde all the way.  There are a lot of Ship building yards where among other ships  in building is a light Cruiser to do 45 miles an hour.                                                I got out to Balloch about dinner-time and strolled through Loch Lomond Park and  passed Balloch Castle, an old place in a very good state of repair, and stood on a hill.   Loch Lomond
