<p>Dear Alan, or Tommykin.<br/>You would have enjoyed being with me while on my journey, only it would have made you so dreadfully tired. A mile is rather a long way, &amp; I have travelled every day 20 or 30 miles, &amp; sometimes more than 50. But of course I have to keep on every night until I reach a place where I can get a bed &amp; some tea, because if I slept out in the bush it would give me a bad cold.</p>
<p>The children in the schools always like to see me, because there are so few visitors. Many children have to walk a long distance to get to school &ndash; I saw one little boy &amp; girl who had to go 2 &frac12; miles each way over a rough mountain, but of course their mother gave them</p>
