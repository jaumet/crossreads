  
 Friday 27th Sea a bit calmer, but very big swell on. Several ships passed, but nothing exciting happened. 
 Saturday 28th Great excitement caused last night by mysterious ship which kept cruising around us, with one light showing. our captain waited till she had seen us and then answered her signals, for she was a destroyer on patrol duty. 
 Heavy swell kept up and was pretty inconvenient
