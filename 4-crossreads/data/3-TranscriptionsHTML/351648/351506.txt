<p>Australian nurses at one of the French Hospitals I shall go in again as often as I can.  I knew them at Hospital when I was a resident, they have promised to introduce me to a charming French V.A.D.  Life is beginning to become interesting again &ndash; what!  I completely wormed myself into their good graces by taking them a lot of sugar &amp; biscuits as their rations are not the best in the French hospitals &amp; sugar is absolutely unobtainable at shops, so "my marble is good" as they say in the Classics.</p>
<p>Well I must write other Aust. letters now, thank you awfully for the coat &amp; for the papers that come along regularly &amp; are a great boon.</p>
<p>Send me a copy of the book "tout de suite" &amp; don't be too severe on the kid &ndash; you wouldn't expect your son to feed out of your hand &ndash; what!</p>
<p>My regards to John.</p>
<p>With all best wishes<br/>Yrs very sincerely<br/>J.B. Metcalfe</p>
<p>P.S.  Did I tell you I was a Major now?</p>
