<p>Tuesday 17 June 1919<br/>Really fine in the morning. Janet &amp; I went for a walk over the hills in the morning &amp; in the afternoon Violet, Janet &amp; I cycled to Loch Eck. Was lovely. It is a freshwater loch. Violet got a puncture &amp; we didn't have any solution or rubber so stopped two men in a cycle side car &amp; they gave us the necessary. Fixed it up &amp; then came home. Went for a bonnie walk after tea.</p>
<p>Wednesday 18 June 1919<br/>Nice again today. There was a couple of showers tho. Wasn't too bad tho. Janet &amp; I cycled to Loch Long &amp; Ardentilly [Ardentinny]. Was bonny too. Hills &amp; trees right on the road. After lunch we stayed home &amp; talked to Janet's Sister in law. After tea she went home &amp; Violet, Janet &amp; I cycled to Glen Massan falls. Very nice there too. We were driven away from the place tho by Midges (gnats).</p>
