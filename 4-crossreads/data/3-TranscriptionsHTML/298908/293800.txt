<p>Had a splendid breakfast fully beef &amp; biscuits a little bread &amp; butter &amp; the usual Army tea, so you can guess I am not feeling too clever just yet with that inside me.<br/>We have been busy giving all sorts of details about ourselves &amp; our addresses whilst in Australia this morning.<br/>Quite a number of the lads including myself are suffering from colds in the head.  I hope we get rid of them before getting home.  I have no desire to get that "Spanish flu" again after what I suffered with it at "Harefield".  I see they have it very bad in South Africa &amp; India, should not be surprised to see it spread to "Aussie" by the time we get there.  It is still raging over here &amp; causing a tremendous number of deaths.  The other day there were more deaths in Glasgow than what the authorities could deal with so that's pretty solid.<br/>Saw a lot of the old hands this morning while they were waiting at Bray old Birdwood came down to see the 1914 men &amp; he got the reception of his life.  I believe old Birdie broke down completely &amp; cried with joy, &amp; the "diggers" broke</p>
