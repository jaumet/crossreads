[Thursday 9 November 1916]
We steered away down past the Straits & are now heading back, a beautiful, warm sunny day, & good to be alive, I am posting letters from Gibraltar to Dolly & Laura England but no advantage to Australia, so keep my Diary-I am very fit & quite ready for the job again-If I get invalided again I am going home to Australia- Dorothy is quite ready for the Bush & I'm a little Homesick to see you all at Bronte after Africa I settled down to hardwork & the Bush so should be glad to do so again- but the war is not over yet of course if I were offered a good military job I might take it.
