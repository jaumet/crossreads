<p>Wednesday 1 March 1916</p>
<p>A nice bright day. Got up after breakfast &amp; spent the morning letter-writing, going to Cairo in the afternoon to try &amp; find the Ross More Pension where Ollie was to stay. Was unsuccessful &amp; returned to camp about 5 o'clock with Capt Minty, our M.O., meeting in the tram an old H.S. boy &amp; University contemporary in the person of 2nd Lieut Marcel Arousseau. He is with the 28th (?) Battn &amp; was about to leave for Tel el Kebir.</p>
<p>Letter-writing again after tea.</p>
<p>Thursday 2 March 1916</p>
<p>Feeling right but stayed inside on a/c of the weather. Hot &amp; windy, clouds of dust &amp; sand blowing everywhere, so much so that the C.O. ordered the afternoon parade to be cut out.</p>
<p>Spent the time in the tent, censoring letters, reading up latest methods etc.</p>
<p>Friday 3 March 1916</p>
<p>Father's birthday &amp; many happy returns duly wished &amp; a birthday party held with Ollie later.</p>
<p>Another hot day &amp; the men were marched out into the desert with midday meal for a full day's work the doctor would not let me go on duty with them.</p>
<p>Instead went into Cairo, found that Oll was not at Ross More House &amp; so went to Pension Wales to enquire. Very much surprised to find her in her old room in bed with tonsillitis. Went to a chemist &amp; got some gargle &amp; swabbing mixture &amp; at intervals attended to her throat.</p>
<p>In the afternoon left her for awhile &amp; went out to get some snaps of street scenes, bringing her back some icecream etc, with which we celebrated Daddy's birthday. Had to return to Aerodrome for 6 o'c mess but afterwards ran in again for a short time. Her throat much better.</p>
