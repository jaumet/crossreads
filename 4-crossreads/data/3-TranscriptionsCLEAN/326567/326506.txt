There is now standing in the yard two very big Guns, they are built each on a long Iron Frameing, a Bogie at each end & the Gun is supported in the Middle, they each weigh 80 Tons, & can throw a shell 7 cwt in weight 11000 yds & fire each 16 Rounds per minute. They are painted all colours to look like the Bush & each have a large number of Wire Screens to be erected to conceal them, they are going out tonight to their positions for the Big Push. Tuesday Night 10/7/17. Fritz with his Big Guns have been throwing shells over all day in all directions, continuing up to Midnight. He is an absolute Pest, Keeps us all
