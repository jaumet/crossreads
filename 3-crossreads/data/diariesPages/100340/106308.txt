Another few linesI met young Jack Walker here (Bessies brother) he wishes to be remembered to you. Bessie married Fred Blackett from Blacktown. I suppose you remember them. (the Blacketts) She had a son born or on our anniversary (April 15) We had a great old yarn I found out from him Ross Jones' address but don't suppose I will see him as he is in London I have had my furlough. We are having bad weather again. Last week was like a week in our winter. Sun, Mon, yesterday were real summer days again but today it is  teeming again pretty cold too. If the weather was as dry as I am for news well there would be no rain. Have met Rowley Jones here (my mate in camp. He came over on same boat and took on a dental job) Have had a pretty fair time with him but it is awfully slow here after Weymouth. Well dear once more good-bye tons of love kisses from Hal
