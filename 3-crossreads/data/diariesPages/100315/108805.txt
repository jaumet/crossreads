21/4/18 ? Lavieville
a battle headquarters. The air is full of Spring all the fruit trees are blossoming and a great flush rests on all the woods and copses. Our chaps potting away at grouse and partridges are a dangerous nuisance. The Hun started to search for a battery near here with 5.9's and for a couple of hours he steadily potted away in an endeavour to get it. The shells were going just 100 yards over our heads and we thanked the good gunnery of the enemy that he kept so well on his mark.
