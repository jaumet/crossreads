of the girls reminded me very much of Fanny.  Then in the house I slept in, the people were very jolly, played cards etc all of which they had learnt since the war.  They knew more games than I knew of almost & could do any amount of card tricks.  This particular village has a great name amongst the troops.
Sunday 15th Oct.Managed to get leave to go to 'Poperinghe" for the purpose of trying to find Morris.  When I arrived there they told me that the 18th had marched out that morning so I set off in pursuit catching them at dinner time only to learn that Morris was not amongst them.  I found out that he was catching the 1 oclock train to 'Wisque' near St Omer to go to training school so perforce had to hurry back.  I would not have done it however as I was dead tired were it not for a motor lorry to which I clung, it took me along at about 15 miles an hour over the cobbles but I hung on like grim death as my only chance of seeing the boy.  I eventually reached the station & to my great joy had the pleasure of a 30 minute's yarn.  He was then a Sgt & was recommended for a commission.  It's cheering to learn
