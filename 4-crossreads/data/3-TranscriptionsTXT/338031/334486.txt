this ancient hostelry beer cost 5d to 6d a pint and fairly good whisky & rum were obtainable at reasonable rates. Some of the old rustics were taciturn & hard to draw out. I think the outrageous rise in the price of beer & the inferior quality of what they used to get at less than half the price had gone into their hearts like cold steel."It's snowing hard tonight, sir," said I to an old codger who was sadly gazing at the great fire."Yes.""Will you allow me to replenish your pot, my friend.""Thank you."
