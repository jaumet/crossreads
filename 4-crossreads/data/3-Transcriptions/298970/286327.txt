<p>On Piquet all day and writing letters in spare time.</p>
<p>5th July (Wednesday)</p>
<p>Issued with 2 Gas Helmets each and a satchel to carry one in.  The other is to be kept in a pocket we have been told to sew on the inside of our tunics.  Small bottle of Iodine and weeping goggles issued.  Guns still to be heard.  First pay in France resulting in many cases of drunken disorder.</p>
<p>6th July (Thursday)</p>
<p>Route march.  In afternoon inspection of Gas Helmets and more pay.  The scene at our billet was disgraceful tonight.  Half the unit were under the influence of drink.  The officers didn't know what to do about it.  Numbers were [indecipherable].  Antiaircraft guns again busy.</p>
