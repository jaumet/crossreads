<p>Sunday 26th December<br/>Another easy day for us, did a lot of washing, made a much better job of it than the previous one, the clothes turned out a dirty yellow instead of black. My first big mail arrived 13 letters in all, including a letter from home, with which I was extremely delighted. We are having perfect weather.</p>
