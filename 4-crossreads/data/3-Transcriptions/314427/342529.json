<p>Sunday April 6.1919   147<br/>[Shorthand transcribed as follows]  6 day on the voyage.  [end of shorthand]  The sea is calm the sun is shining out warm but the sky is cloudy. Rain fell after dinner. There was a church parade at 11 a.m. on the top deck. It  was poorely attended. A number of gambling schools in various parts of the ship was much better attended. Two-up, Even and over Sevens, and numbers were the chief games played. These two latter games are played with dice, and are similar to crown &amp; anchor, which has been prohibited on board. Numerous card games below deck were also in full swing. As a result of these various games some of the men are penniless and a few much richer. The trouble is all cannot be winners.</p>
<p>We were told at breakfast that during the 24 hours ending yesterday the ship made 328 miles, which announcement was received with cheers.</p>
