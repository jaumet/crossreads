<p>12-7-1918<br/>Wet day.  The enemy has evacuated our sector, Infantry can't find him.  About 1,000 prisoners passed through our sector yesterday and 36 machine gun captured;  Most of the prisoners were Prussian Guards, Germany's crack regiment.  Our heavy Artillery active all night.  18 pdrs. forbidden to fire.  Weather conditions bad for flying.  One of our drivers awarded 14 days 2nd field punishment.</p>
<p>13-7-1918<br/>Hun aeroplanes over, last night, dropped some bombs near our wagon line.  They then bombed St. Omer.  This is worthy of note, considering the state of the weather, a gale was blowing at the time.  Our 2nd Bde. got cut up, they hopped over, but Fritzs was waiting for them.  About 200 prisoners passed by last</p>
