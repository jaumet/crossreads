  
 Belgium, 9 July 16 My dearest old Irene, Was delighted to get a letter from you a few days  few  back. - Poor old girl! I am sorry to hear you are to have another op. & do hope that long ere you get this letter you will be well on the way to being quite recovered. We expect to move on again at any time probably to-night or tomorrow - Had the first game of  Cr  Football I have had for 10 years yesterday - & my word! aren't I just tired & stiff. It was an inter-section game & the chaps were very keen on my having a game as there is a good deal of rivalry. - Never.more ! I am too old - but we won 27 points to 3. Am glad to hear that Will has charge as O.C. of the Details Camp at George's Heights Mosman. - Have they given him a star to add to his Crown? - No chance of leave to England now - Dear little "Tinysie"! I would love to see her at the Dancing Class. - am sure they all love her.
