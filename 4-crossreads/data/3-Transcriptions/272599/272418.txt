<p>1917 Monday 28 May</p>
<p>See the Orderly Officer with view to get me taken off my job. Sees the W.O. Eddington - a miserable beer soaked cad. Get what I want &amp; put on general duties not back to my old job. <br/>After tea go with Radford into Boulogne book seats for self &amp; Mac for "Madam Butterfly" 5 francs. <br/>Stroll on Plage &amp; enjoy watching French people --- the fog cloud</p>
