<p>Monday 22 March 1915</p>
<p>Reveille at 5.30 a.m. this morning, followed by an early muster of the Battalion.  A careful inspection followed, and each platoon was sized, that is to say, the tallest on either flank, the shortest in the middle.  The Brigade was then marched about half a mile out of camp and the Division formed up in review order, to be inspected by the High Commissioner for Egypt, Sir H. McMahon.  The "review" as usual, was a farce.  Twenty or twenty-five horsemen, headed by Sir Mc. and General Godley, galloped past the front line of each unit at about 50 yards distance away.  Then the "inspection" was over.  Afterwards the March Past took place, the Australian Light Horse and the N.Z. Mounted Rifles looking very fine indeed, and making a great impression.  But the infantry was, to say the least, disappointing.  The marching was not good and the dust shocking.  In fact, this dust nuisance spoilt the whole parade.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we brushed up our company drill &ndash; a department of our work in which we are very weak.  This is noticeable throughout the whole of the second contingent &ndash; the great weakness in ceremonial work.  But it is more than counterbalanced by our greater efficency in field work, a department of much more importance on active service.</p>
