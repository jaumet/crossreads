the afternoon and this morning I have to go off to some place for a three days school on signalling with aeroplanes, and after that there is talk of another stunt so I have to finish this letter off at once. I am posting home this morning per registered post a big book of views of Jerusalem; I bought it while I was up there and have seen a good many of the places shown in it - will write you a description of them when I go on with my book; also a packet of 10 photos. These photos are taken from a film found in a camera captured from a Turkish officer and the chap who got the camera took it on and took photos with it of Alenby's entry of Jerusalem. The photos of the turks are supposed to be at Sheria - but I cannot swear to it, although it look like the country there - but thay are dinkum turks alright and of course the Jerusalem ones are correct. Our interpreter's photo is in one of them near the Jaffa gate and he was telling me all about them. Must stop now Mother. Love to Father  the boys & yourself. I am Your loving son, Robert C Wilson
