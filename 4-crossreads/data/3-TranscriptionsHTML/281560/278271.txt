<p>station. Marched 10 miles or so to a town called, Saint Guen. A nice little town; there has never been any Australians here before hence the surprise of the natives. The boys are taking this opportunity to enjoy themselves, for there is much innocent amusement and good liquor to be had here.  <br/>12/7/16.<br/>Again an early start, but we only went a few kilos, to another town called Vignacourt. Here I am billeted in the "Billet Ideal". There are chairs and tables and pictures on the wall. The "Madame" of the place is O.K. too, the one in our last place was a veritable Fury.  She told us; or rather our Captain, that we were worse than the Germans, because we washed in her horse trough. What would she say if we burned her house.</p>
