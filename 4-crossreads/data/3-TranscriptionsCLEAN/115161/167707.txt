Our next - and my last place of residence, in a foreign country for some time to come, if ever again - is
DINANT.
Lying in the valley of the Meuse, this town at once appeals to the lover of the picturesqueness and beauty of nature.  Right through the centre of the town flows the beautiful - and now historic river, which is spanned by bridges, the principal one being a very fine piece of work, with the exception of one end of same which was destroyed in the very early days of the enemy advance. - during August 1914.
From both sides of the town rise precipitous hills, - or mountains - grand and picturesque, as if protecting this pretty town.  On the summit of the east side is a huge fort, surrounded by a great wall, from which is a sheer descent of hundreds of feet to the valley below.
Many large and substantial buildings remain, but unfortunately a few of the main ones were destroyed, when the enemy first took possession.  Otherwise the town is very little knocked about.  The church steeple - which was, I understand, of copper - was removed by the enemy, as were also many other things which were of military value.
The advent of the enemy into this beautiful town of Dinant on the 23rd. August 1914 was accompanied by wholesale murder, rapine, and other atrocities unparallelled.  Civilians were placed against walls and shot by the soldiers as sport for the drunken officers who gave orders. - Over six hundred and fifty men - old and young - were dealt with in this manner, during the first three days of the enemy's occupation. - Three hundred girls were placed in the church to which access was only granted to the enemy soldiers.  Many committed suicide, many lost their reason. - Houses were burnt and children were bayoneted and thrown into the flames. - Many people sought refuge in the forts and when this last chance failed, they threw themselves over the walls and met their merciful death on the rocks below.
