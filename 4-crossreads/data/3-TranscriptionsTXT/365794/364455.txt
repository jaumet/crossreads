 Friday 23 February 1917 [22 February 1918] Once more I have a severe cold &amp; feel miserable, still go out &amp; on duty same as ever.  Silk frock fitted 6 p.m. at Chemla freres &amp; will be nice (one hopes).  Pt. 400 should make it so but alas, not always.  Printed photos 23 before going to bed 10.30 p.m.
