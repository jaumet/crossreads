Arrived there the C.O. was called to a conference at Bde Hqrs.
2.30 p.m.  The C.O. returned with the news that we are to attempt the crossing after all tonight.
5.30 p.m.  Attack cancelled again.  Patrols only have been ordered to establish ed themselves on the opposite bank.  The difficulty lies in the marshes which exist for a considerable distance on the other side of the river.  We moved forward about 1000 yards along the trench about dusk.
Mr. Gannon the Intelligence Officer of this Bn. whilst reconnoitring along the trench was severely wounded by a gas shell.  The enemy shelled this area fiercely with H.E. and Gas Shells about this time.
