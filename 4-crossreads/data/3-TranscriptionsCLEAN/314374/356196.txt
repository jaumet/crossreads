  
 (12) given our breakfast of pork and beans and then went in motor lorries through the ruins of Neuve Eglise, up to Messines where we were engaged in making roads and digging trenches.  We generally got in an hour or twos work because as soon as it was dawning day the enemy used to bombard our positions and then it was leave off work and get back to safety the best way one could.  I remember one morning the enemy followed us with his shells right back to our motor lorries (which we had left on the cobble stoned road near the big military cemetery).  We had several narrow escapes - some were wounded but none killed.  I soon learnt to assume the "prone" position, that is fall flat down on one's stomach as soon as one heard a shell coming over. 
 While here we had a good look over Steenwerck which contained a fine old church with a famous grotto.  The Bishop of Armentierres removed to Steenwerck after his city was destroyed by the Germans in 1917, but he had to flee again from Steenwerck in March 1918 during the big German offensive. 
 On 22nd August we marched to Steenwerck Railway station and entrained.  After a three hours journey we arrived at Wizurnes, [Wizernes] where we got out and then marched to the pretty little village of Remilly (near Lumbres) where we remained for several weeks practising for the Battle of Ypres. 
 Our stay here was very happy indeed.  We were the first Australian troops to be billetted there and the people were very good and kind to us.  Our platoon was billetted in a good barn with plenty of straw and Madame and her daughters couldn't do enough for us.  She had beautiful grapes growing, which we used to buy at a franc (tenpence) per lb.  It speaks volumes for the Aussies here, when the peoples' fruit was quite safe and none of it was stolen by the troops.  The beautiful stream flowing through the village was great and many a good swim we enjoyed after coming back hot from the parade ground or a route march.  No costumes were required and it was a common sight to see several hundred Aussies swimming in the stream near where the bridge crossed it in the main street.  My brother's battalion (41st) was billetted in an old paper mill close by and I often saw him.  I also visited the towns of Lumbres, Wavrans, and Wizurnes and the fine old ancient and interesting city of St Omer.  In peace time this city contained 90,000 inhabitants.  Its Cathedral was majestic and was remembered by me for its famous clock inside over the main door.  The Cathedral of St Omer many [may] bring back memories of other things to some soldiers who may read this. 
 One day we marched to Flamburelles and were reviewed by Sir Douglas Haig.  We had plenty of severe drilling here and I was transferred to the rifle grenadiers section. 
 A regiment of Portuguese soldiers were camped close by.  They used to walk through our village and some of our men used to call them "pork and beans".  They resented this and reported it to our Commander so we were drawn up on the parade ground one day and given a severe reprimand - being reminded that the Portuguese were the oldest allies of England.  However, they didn't prove themselves very good soldiers during the big German offensive of March 1918.
