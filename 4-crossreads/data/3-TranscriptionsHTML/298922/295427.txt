<p>Wednesday 11 April 1917</p>
<p>Reconnaissance yesterday evening. I went 5 miles past the Outpost line &amp; got shelled by enemy. Water very scarce saw plenty of Turks1 &amp; their line of Tranches was plainly seen. Fun on sand, beautiful green feed but no natural water.</p>
<p>I rode 40 miles - &amp; took a lot of Bearings by Compass.</p>
<p>Enemy plane flew low over us &amp; fired his machine gun. No fountain pen ink so try &amp; forgive pencil.</p>
<p><strike>Found letters on my return &ndash; MAY 4/4/17, LAURA 20/4/17, FERRAR 20/4/17, DOLLY 20/4/17. Alls well.</strike></p>
