<p>study it.  I am enclosing some letters, a card from some of my English Friends which I hope will reach you safely.  The weather is very wet but not so cold.  Ellis is playing "Rummy" with one of our Pay Sergeants, a game of Cards.</p>
<p>Well, I must go for a tour round shortly so as there is no news to give you other than that which Ellis wrote this afternoon, I will say Bon Soir.  I must write to Billy H., our Prime Minister as soon as I return from the rounds.</p>
<p>Best of Love<br/>We'll soon be returning,<br/>Harry.</p>
