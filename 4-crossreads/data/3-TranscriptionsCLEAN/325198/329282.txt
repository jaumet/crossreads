7 April, 1916Selhai [Salhia]There is a horrible rumour afloat to the effect the we are on the camp site of the 1st LH Bde, this after we have got nice & comfortable, our tent right up against the mess room & fixed up with rifle stand,  wash stand & a place for our bandoliers & belts, its too much to say nothing of the work we did  to get our horse lines in order - if the rumour is true, wont there just be a roar from the 2nd LHB ? it will surely cause a heat wave.  They are deucedly long winded with their pay days recently.  I wish they would pay, its rotten to be broke.  Im on picquet to night & have drawn 3rd shift, will have to turn out at three in the morning
