<p>My dear Dad,</p>
<p>Its the hardest thing in the world to get envelopes here. They are scarcer than pure gold. Have scoured the whole area and can only now and then rake up a few. For this reason I&#39;m afraid I have to enclose in the home letters, notes to other parties, trusting to your kindness to forward them. Am still fit and well and enjoying this novel life to the full. It is quite exciting now, though much quieter than it was afew weeks ago. Tommy Turk learned a severe lesson last time he attacked so I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll come again unless specially ordered by Von Liman. So we are just marking time with occasional sorties now and then to keep the enemy awake. The bombardment of our position is spasmodic; comes with a rush some days and there is then comparative peace for hours. The loophole snipers are also far less active and the casualties in our trenches are few. We were told at the outset that the trenches were the safest place to be, and this is quite true. Shrapnel now and then knocks down the parapets and does a little damage, but in the Shrapnel Valley and Suicide Walk it bursts at all times and even in the dugouts one is not wholly safe. Our Brigade has been in the trenches for about three weeks, and our losses are about 12 killed and 70 wounded. Col. Ryrie does the rounds of the trenches every day and of course I accompany him. Now and then we try our hands at sniping with more or less success. Its very strenuous work climbing up and down these hills and we are getting into great condition.</p>
<p>Saw Kieut. Cook yesterday - son of Joseph. He, was wounded and is now well again. Also saw Major McNaughten, also wounded, but now almost well. Al Chrystal is well. Les Holmes is still at Maadi. We are anxious to get our horses so as to get the Turks on the run. This trench fightin becomes very dreary after a time. We are hoping that the big forward movement will be soon on.</p>
<p>The view from Braund&#39;s Hill is fine, especially the sunsets. The islands in the Aegean Sea seem to be stuck on the edge of a gorgeous canvas of shimmering gold. I am able to get a swim nearly every day so I am keeping very fit. Most of the men in the trenches are &quot;chatty&quot;. This is a polite word to express the fact that they share their dug-outs with hundreds of &quot;visitors&quot;. They put in their spare time &quot;hunting&quot;, and have sweeps to see who catches the most live stock. Their joy so far has been spared me. The climate here is perfect. Every prospect pleasing and only the German is vile.</p>
<p>My best love to Mother and the girls, and kind remembrances to all friends.</p>
<p>Your affec. Son,</p>
<p>OLIVER.</p>
