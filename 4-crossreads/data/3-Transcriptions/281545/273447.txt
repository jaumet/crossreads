<p>Laying Machine.    Having picked up three trucks of sleepers behind the Engine I was hooked on to three trucks of Rails &amp; the Track Layer &amp; after obtaining a Lunch from the Coy's Cook House &amp; the gang finished their lunch, work was started.   A number of men were on the trucks rolling the rails up to the Layer &amp; another lot were carrying sleepers from the trucks behind &amp; placing them ahead &amp; the Gib of the Layer would pick up a Rail which was rolled alongside from the Rear &amp; place it ahead on the Sleepers, when I would move ahead a few yards until the next rail was placed &amp; so on until all the Sleepers &amp; rails were laid which took us three hours.   It was now after 3 Pm &amp; after placing the Layer &amp; Empties where I picked them up, I came back through the Balloon Siding were I had to shunt a load of Material out &amp; make up a Train for Arques.   After completing I started &amp; in a few minutes arrived at Arques were I shunted my load into a Siding &amp; came back to St Omer &amp; signed off at 7.30 Pm after a very long day of 15 hours although very interesting &amp; instructive.   After a hot tea, &amp; a chat I turned in at 9 Pm &amp; had a grand sleep as I was very tired.</p>
<p>Thursday April 25th.   After a good night's rest I arose at 8 am &amp; after Breakfast I went up the town for a stroll until Dinner time &amp; then had another sleep in the afternoon, because I expected to get a call for duty any time after tea.   As it happened my mate &amp; myself</p>
