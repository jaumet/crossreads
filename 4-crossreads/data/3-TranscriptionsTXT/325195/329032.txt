11.12.15Sat 11thThe 54th Division of English Tommies that landed at Suvla have been withdrawn off the Peninsula, I believe a good many Australian troops are also being sent away, 3 battery of Artillery going tonight; It is the general opinion that only enough men are to be left here to garrison the ground we have & the rest are to be sent to Servia; If they intend to evacuate the Peninsula altogether I hope I am not one fighting the rear guard action as they will have a very poor chance of getting away alive; A message came through from Bde today asking for the names of more men of the 1st LH who want commissions in the 1st Infantry Bde; Garbett received a star yesterday, also Mann into the 4th Btn
