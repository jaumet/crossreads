Thursday 8 February 1917 [7 February 1918]Saw Capt. Collins 9.30 a.m. & arm examined, ex-rayed by Capt. McCullock 11 a.m.  By the way a strange sensation it is to see one's arm bones appearing on the screen.  Both Captains very kind.  Went town 2 p.m. with S. Saunderson & saw mosques three in number & one with pretty windows, others not impressive - then took 2 street photos then visited Arabic museum, very fine old glass & ancient work, carvings & brass utensils.Groppi's for 4 p.m. tea & so back to 27th.  8 p.m. went to thank Mr. Belcher for drive to station when going to Luxor & gave my photos to see.
