 whole thing.  The sausages first burst into flames and then 
 exploded and fell to earth.  Each would contain two expert 
 observers so their loss would be no small one to Fritz.  That 
 night the Germans were evidently very angry for they threw 
 things at us for hours.  We didn't mind his shells that night 
 though, we were so tickled about his bal ^  l oons.  The Boche 
 still shows a preference for Churches when he starts shelling. 
 Only this week he picked out two tall steepled edifices in 
 Armentiers - he didn't touch anything else, he just wanted to 
 try a new gun or something.  Mind you a church steeple makes a 
 fine target and must have the same impelling fascination for an 
 artilleryman as a window in an empty house has for a small boy 
 with a stone in his hand.  The man behind a gun seldom sees what 
 he is firing at and therefore does not get the satisfaction of 
 observing the damage he does.  An opportunity to knock over 
 something visible like a church steeple must be very inviting 
 and after all there seem to be plenty of them to spare.  Every 
 little village, every hamlet even, has an enormous church with an 
 equally big steeple.  I won't go so far as to say that the 
 country is over churched but there are a great number of them 
 vacant.  The rectors are at the war - not as chaplains but as 
 combatants - the male portion of the congregation is at the 
 war and the women folk are far too busy working to go to church. 
 The Germans do not often trouble Armentieres but when they do, 
 we have only to plunk a couple into Lille and they stop at once. 
 Lille and Armentieres are within about six miles of each other 
 and it is said (I give it for what it is worth) that British 
 Engineers tapped the Electric supply xxxx cable feeding Lille 
 and for four months lit Armentieres at the Huns' expense.
