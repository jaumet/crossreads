 July, 1917. Monday 2 (Residents abroad should now order this Diary for 1918.) No 6.30 parade as sergeants evidently not recovered from previous evenings potations. Drill order at 8.30 &amp; went for route march to Froissy and Cappy. Home about 11.00. No parades in aftn. so enjoyed some reading. Went for a swim in evening and read some more. Gray a fool. Fine day.
