<p>Recd tobacco parcel today, also PC from Berlin Red Cross [indecipherable] a reply to my letter of 31/7/17. They have Sgt Wynne on Record as a Prisoner of War, &amp; as soon as He is drafted to a camp, I will be advised. He apparently is working behind the line somewhere in France. Lt Gowing is not &ndash; recorded as a prisoner of war. I now fear the result.</p>
<p>Had a general clean up of our cupboard today. Debate tonight subject being "That the Railways of the United Kingdom should be nationalised" The motion was lost by 30 votes.</p>

<p>Played bridge. Had two guests to supper tonight. I was the cook supplying a meat pudding soup asparagus Date &amp; Jam tart, coffee.</p>
<p>Not feeling well this last day or so.</p>
<p>Cap Robinson &amp; Lt Berline are in trouble. A German Cpl reported to the Commdt here that Robinson &amp; Berline, offered him &pound;200 to give them the Key of the front door, so as to enable them to escape; When called before the Commdt this mng they denied having done such a thing. The Commdt explained if they admitted that they said such a thing in a Joke He would overlook the matter. They still denied so the Commdt has referred them to Higher Authority. It is believed that this is being done as a reprisal because 2 German officers have just been awarded 9 mths imprisonent for a similar offence.</p>
