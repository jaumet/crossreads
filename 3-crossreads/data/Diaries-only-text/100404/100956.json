Thursday 27th April Broiling day, tent erecting and chasing about getting men into hospital and pinching and claiming gear I did not get my dispensary erected until late in pm. There has been scrapping down the other side of the canal, a squadron of yeomanry were cut off and a lot of [indecipherable] caught asleep in their beds and we believe some LH had a go. We are getting a bit restive. 
 Friday 28th Got my dispensary in order and commenced operations. Big mail in I got four letters. Everybody is disgusted with the Yeomanry and their defeat on the canal. Three Hospital trains went up to-day, so there must be another scrap down there. The 4th Regt had to stand to arms last night owing to the disgraceful scenes at Tel-el-Kebir station. Every night something is set on fire and last night five canteens were burned down raided. The scum are the [indecipherable] of Wooloomooloo, and are the same crowd that wrecked Sydney they are our companions in arms.
Saturday 29th April 40 cases of comforts have arrived and been distributed mostly foodstuffs Truly we are very grateful to the people of Australia. I got a big box of tinned foods etc for my men, and took charge of all the med comforts for the march. In the p m the officers played the men cricket and the men won easily, Albert Cotton made 102. Everyman had a bottle of beer presented him to-day, it was regiments funds shout.
Sunday 30th Still busy am treating my cases just the same as at Oasis. The camp is much neater looking than the old one, it is an immense camp of over twelve miles circuit and nearly 10000 men here, but they are a tough lot, sticking at nothing.
Monday 1st May Bad news received that Gen Townshends force had surrendered, another crying shame to the B.[indecipherable]. Also that marshal law had been proclaimed in Ireland. Things are looking blacker than ever.
