<p>After lunch, accompanied with the usual hot drink the final stage of the long journey is entered upon. Just outside Abberville a glimpse is caught of the estuary of the Somme opening out to a wide bay and beyond this the English Channel. It sent a thrill right through one to think that just over there was Old England. We took it as a good omen that whilst we were thus straining to get our first sight of the Channel the sun broke through the gloom and lightened the whole scene.<br/>The country was now flat and low-lying, with numerous waterways in which were growing the usual pollards here covered with catkins. Houses and villages were scattered, and comparatively few people, of a more stolid appearance than down south were at work in the fields, composed of heavy clay rather light in colour, ridge cultivation was general. Here and there were quaint looking windmills and further on, as we passed through a wood in which a number of rooks were flying round the tree-tops, we could make out the sand dune country of the coast.<br/>Approaching Estaples our train passed others full of Canadians and Belgians with much cheering from both sides and a t a township where a brief stop was made, a lady collecting money for some Red Cross organisation thrust her box into each compartment. At last we crossed a bridge over the estuary on the shore of which 2 lighthouses stand out predominately and ran into a station where we saw the name "Estaples". It was a town with some 6000 inhabitants just outside which was the huge base camp of the British Armies in France. I think everyone regretted that our journey across France was at an end. It had been cold and tiring but was crammed full of interesting sights from start to finish.</p>
