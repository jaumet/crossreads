Aug 23rd - 18This morning I set out to fulfil my promised visit to Mrs Armstrong and arrived at West bay (Dorset) about 5PM. Here are beautiful surroundings and right on the sea shore.
It is here that I fully realise the truth of clean sheets and fresh air. It is hard to say how I fully appreciate it after leaving the war zone with all its dust, evil smells and shattered villiages.
Aug 27th - 18Today I returned to London feeling entirely refreshed
