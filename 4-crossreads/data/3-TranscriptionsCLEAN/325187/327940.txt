Tinned Fruit Pickles & all those things a School boy likes , we are only a bit overgrownWe have to thank those good women who went thro' the ordeal of the Queen business I suppose for swelling the funds to send this stuff along.Boxing Competition last night but too hot, anything to change the men's thoughts from Stand to Arms etc etc.A dozen mouth organs & a concertina or two would amuse them.You would be surprised on a moonlight night to hear the Music that is knocked out as the men Ride along when "all clear" & going back to Camp
