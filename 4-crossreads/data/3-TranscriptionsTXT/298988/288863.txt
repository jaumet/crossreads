they have had this last few days.  We are only 150 yards from all this, but I suppose the Warships are better game.  I wanted to get a photograph of one bursting too.  I always was unlucky though.
1 p.m.  Firing has continued steadily all the morning, both from the Warships & the land forces, but the Turks dont seem to be using any shrapnel.  They are firing plenty of bullets & the Chief Officer & a Sailor of a Tug, that took some of our Provisions etc in during the morning were wounded whilst landing them.  Bullets are falling like peas over there.  We are sending in three more "lighters" full now & I was going ashore to get a photograph or two but "cold feet" has set in.  Capt Kirby whom we landed with the 26th Mountain Battery, was wounded in the temple & the top of the head on the first day.  They found him directing the operations of his battery in a dazed condition & at once took him to the hospital ship.  They bandaged his head & whilst they were busy shortly afterwards he slipped in one of the boats that was returning & rejoined his men.  He was aboard here today with his head bandaged, but did not mention anything of this, which had been told us by Major Bruce his Commandant.  They are soldiers these Britishers.
The H.M.S. Prince of Wales is busy now keeping the Turks from becoming despondent.
5 p.m.  Have just been witnessing a grand & stirring battle.  Apparently at a signal five Battleships (Queen, Prince of Wales, London, Bacchante & Queen Elizabeth)
