<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 13th &amp; we had our final orders issued to us to return our equipment &amp; get ready to march out for Blighty &amp; Home perhaps on the 15th.  So we are all standing by, Patients &amp; all, &amp; we send the first batch off at 9 am in the morning.  We will then be able to set the wires going for our return to Australia which we have not been able to do in France.  Ellis &amp; Billy Hanrahan have gone for a stroll but I am attracted by a good orchestra which is playing here to-night &amp; I will wait until the performance is over (the band gave me a start) before I rejoin them.  We are all in the gayest of spirits</p>
