4time permits as I am going to London to bring a leave party back. There is nothing to do. You catch the same train as party & get out at your destination & go home. It means a pleasant little trip at Government expense though it involves a lot of travelling
27 December 1918Rose 5 am as uncertain what hour train will move but a party moves off at 6 am. Train arrives 10 am Waterloo. Report to RTO & meet Clarke who gives me photos of lodge.
I then visit Countess of Harrowby to thank her for my trip to Northumberland. Here I meet Digby who has been out in Mespot & is now in a London Hospital drawing 2 pays until a ship sails for Australia
We dine at Au Peut Riche & I give a book to Elise Drumont 15 Stacey St London Then with Digby visit Kennedy & say good bye - then to Alcocks but office is closed - to Ballie Tea Rooms St Marys Axe then I leave Digby as I have promised Lady Gore to take tea with her.
Here I met Miss Muriel Seymour of 34
