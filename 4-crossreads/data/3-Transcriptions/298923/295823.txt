<p>6 June 1918 Thursday<br/>March tonight <strike>Jalaat-Et-Dumm</strike><br/>Once more we go to the 1st line all night march back to the Valley-   We must stick it out altho' many think the 1st L.H. have done more than their share.  Had lunch in <strike>Bethlehem</strike> &amp; saw a "Cow" being milked in the street with a <u>stuffed</u> calf put in front of her &amp; carried along to next house.<br/>Had a "bath" &amp; am all ready for the Heat, flies, &amp; whatever is in store for us.  The men are all keen &amp; a good lot but they've had a good time with the girls &amp; are quite fresh after the change up here in the hills.</p>
