<p>Anzac<br/>20/12/15<br/>of dirty rags and papers and slept. After 3 days without sleep it was sweet. Awakened at 0930 by someone saying "We are going alongside". Went on deck on found we were lying in Mudros harbour. Transhipped to TS "Camponilla" and after lunch transhipped once more to the "Waterwitch" which landed us at a pier at Sarpi. We marched about 5 miles to camp and being fired and loaded up with packs we had to rest frequently. Reached camp after dark and after getting tents got to bed about 2100. Slept like a top, all the lads dead tired and not a sound heard except snores until 0800 next morning. This day the 20/12/15 is the longest in my life. I've fought Turks, gone thro' an evacuation, sailed in various craft, and done God knows what including pitching a camp since last midnight.</p>
<p>21/12/15<br/>Settling down in Mudros Camp no parades but plenty of fatigues arranging sanitation and stores. Heavy rain during day and wind. Had this rough weather come yesterday it would have blocked us getting off the Peninsula. Providence? &ndash; or the Devil? Our first (1A) party has not turned up probably at some other port. Q.M. Craig &amp; 170 others in this. Quiet, all dog tired, weary, and nervous, thanking God for a rest</p>
<p>The men smile at each other and seem all strung up to a high tension. They go about in a strained way frightened to shout or to go over a sky line and a wag has only to make a hissing noise like a shell to cause a scatter. When a man hears a shell his instinct makes him go for cover. Men have got behind a waterproof sheet. The Maltese &amp; Egyptian labours used to cover their head.</p>
