<p>in his dugout from Mone, so I opened it. It was a tin of plum pudding, very nice too. Fritz opened up his shelling again suddenly tonight, there have been rumours for days he is to make an offensive tomorrow. We had to keep our boots on tonight &amp; be ready to move up on 5 minutes notice. <br/>Wedn. 8 May Well, Fritz didn't come over. About 3 a.m. our side poured over a heavy barrage of shells for about 20 minutes. We got up at 3 a.m., had breakfast (tea &amp; Maconnochies) &amp; worked till 9 , putting up barbed wire, &amp; if he breaks through in front, he'll get what he's looking for in the rear. The chaps worked hard &amp; got a lot done. I had a sleep till dinner time. At 5 p.m. went across to Boo's dugout, &amp; was disgusted to find that he &amp; Eldridge were away again digging. Poor beggar, talk about coming out for a rest, he's been on fatigue day &amp; night since they came out of the line. Our company is lucky in the job we struck. At 7 p.m. we went up to the Crucifix to carry barbed wire to our position ready to put up tomorrow. Fritz sent over some gas shells &amp; we had to put our masks on, some of the chaps nearest to where they burst got a whiff that made their nose</p>
