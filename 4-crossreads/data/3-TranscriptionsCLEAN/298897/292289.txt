  
 It will be your duty not only to set an example of discipline & perfect steadiness under fire, but also to maintain the most friendly relations with those whom you are helping in this struggle.  The operations in which you are engaged will for the most part take place in a friendly country, and you can do your own country no better service than in showing yourself in France & Belgium as the true character of a British Soldier. 
 Be invariably courteous, considerate & kind.  Never do anything likely to injure or destroy property and always look upon looting as a disgraceful act.  You are sure to meet with a welcome and to be trusted.  Your conduct must justify that welcome & that trust.  Your duty cannot be done unless your health is sound, so keep constantly on your guard against any excesses in this new experience.  You may find temptations both in wine & women.  You must entirely resist both temptations, and while treating all women with perfect courtesy, you should avoid any intimacy.  Do your duty bravely.  Fear God. Honour the King. 
 3rd June Kings birthday, passed over with comment in the camps.
