<p>February, 1915<br/>Wednesday 10</p>
<p>I am doing all I can to see the Historical places while here &amp; at [indecipherable]. Went to the Pyramids yesterday, rode camel with the Medical Officer &amp; returned by Donkey &ndash; the Sphinx lies [indecipherable] beyond &ndash; I went into the heart of the Pyramid &amp; saw the tomb of an ancient monarch <u>buried 4000 B.C.</u> Statistics as to size etc. can be read in Encyclopedias but the atmoSphere inside is filthy the Catacomb passage like a combat hole.<br/>In the evening went to Meddi Camp finished up at the Casino. My French is very rusty &amp; if a boy could only look ahead at school he would pay more attention to his languages - [indecipherable] in the Casino can speak 5 or 6 languages.</p>
