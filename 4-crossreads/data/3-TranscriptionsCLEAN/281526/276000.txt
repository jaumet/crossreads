  
 9/12/17 Mt. Kemmell & Bailleul Raining. Left with Proudfoot for Bailleul about 10 and had a quick ride to there over slippery and sloppy roads. Being Sunday the working folk had on their best clothes and were trudging back from Mass. In Bailleul things were quiet and I saw the dentist and got a new denture. Did a little shopping and then returned reaching camp before noon. Everyone is much depressed today on account of the bad news that the papers are full of. Spent the afternoon on routine jobs and dealt with a couple of Orderly Room cases and also with a man charged with posting a letter in a Civil Post Office. It rained nearly all the afternoon and about 4.30 it was pitch dark. Indeed 3.30 sees it dark these days. Fritz is putting over very heavy high big shrapnel whether trying for balloons or something else it is hard to say. We detailed 100 men for Bde. Church parade - no volunteers.
