the impulse of the moment
Got nicely burnt about the face yesterday this morning my nose is like a ripe cherry, hope it goes off before I get home or they will be thinking that I am a walking advertisement for "Johnny Walker"
The whole ship had a kit inspection this afternoon all military surplus articles were taken away from the men you would have been surprised had you only seen the immense quantities of clothing, such as hats breeches shirts boots tunics extra blankets that were collected, luckily for me I missed this for I was put on one of the gangways to stop all troops from going below while they were examining kits clearing the decks of clothing etc, so I have still got the few things in my black kit bag, I think I have a good chance of getting through with them now
