 Companions of the "Bath" get to work after breakfast. & put through most of patients before dinner.  The W. O. tells me that I am transferred from "A" Sec bearers to "B" Sec. Tent Division.  Sorry to move out of A. Sec. but know I'm not much good for bearing for a while.  MacBurney, Johno' & self get ride into Albert for paper.  Parade the streets & put in evening. News still good from front line.  America about to declare war.
