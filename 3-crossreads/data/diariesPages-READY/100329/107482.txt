which the troops could hear but not see. "What the eye don’t see the heart don’t grieve."

Rabbit diet for dinner getting mighty monotonous – insipid, tough, & boney.

Day was intolerably hot & muggy.

Thursday 15th July 1915

Equatorial weather with a vengeance. Blistering heat. Scarce a ripple on the sea. Sour bread & corned horse for dinner. Complained about bread but was given the option of hard biscuits for 3 days or continuance of bread. "This is the life." Crossed the Equator at noon. Half holiday. Neptune’s sports & boxing championships.

Uneventful.

Saturday 17th July 1915

Fresh westerly – heavy swell. Boxing semi finals on saloon deck – rough conditions at night – saloon deck port side frequently awash – slept below – bad night – ship rolling heavily – about 4 a.m. all awakened by terrific thump on ship’s side & scattering of crockery, plates, boxes & other gear. Many thought it was a collision so great was the noise. When we rose at Reveille the mess deck was strewn with a mass of gear – from plates, knives, forks, cups, cheese, butter, clothes etc. In fact everything had been shifted by the impact of the night – wind blowing strong from W – proximity of coast no doubt the cause – expect to pass Aden during day or night.

Sunday 18th July 1915

Hellish weather – monsoon – decks awash all day.

Boat changed her course about 2 pm to due west from NW, as we approach Gulf of Aden. Then we received the full blast of the terrific wind & storm wrack – great green seas came at us as if determined to envelop us in one huge swallow & thumped down on the deck every minute or two like mighty knocks from a gigantic hammer. The ship alternately rolled & pitched & the storm continued late into the night. Lily two years old today.
