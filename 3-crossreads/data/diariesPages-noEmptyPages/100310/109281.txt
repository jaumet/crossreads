the General for leave and was not choked off. Had orderly room took a Summary of Evidence. Early mess and sent the OC Coys out on to the ground early with Matthews brought out the companies with their seconds in command in charge. Carried out an outpost scheme using D Coy as enemy but we should have been in position earlier to get the fullest advantage from the exercise. General Paton walked round with me. The work was not too good to take it all round and showed a lack of grip of the fundamental principles. The challenging was too loud and not strict enough. A pleasant mild evening this. Returned about 10.30 with W.J. Cawthorn leaving Matthews and Stewart to bring the men in. They did a silent march halfway and then completed it at ease. Some gunflashes lighting up the sky fitfully tonight the glare of a furnace some miles off.
