<p>20<br/>I often feel that the battle field has opened a chance for a rare book to be written</p>
<p>One which no war correspondent will even attempt.  One which no mere journalist is capable of covering.  Yet which will require the experience of such men.</p>
<p>There is so much of the profound intense depth of poor human nature shaken to the surface by the terrors and calamities of war that a contemplative nature cannot help seeing the possibilities of more than interesting romance.</p>
<p>My poor attempts to describe something of this stupendous upheaval of the creature at its pinacle of civilization, seem so mean and colourless that I almost despair.</p>
<p>And whatever I attempt remains such a very very small part of that which I wish to express.</p>
<p>With the exception of a mere scratch on the hand I am now quite well, and in a few days even that scratch will be healed.  Of course I am thankful.</p>
<p>From the hospital where the beautiful woman looks down from a picture on the wall, I was taken to a hospital of tents, then to another from which by train I was taken to Boulogne and put in a hospital not far from there, then shifted to yet another from which I wrote the last letter and from there brought to where I am now</p>
<p>It all happened quickly but is quite a long story.</p>
