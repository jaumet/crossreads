complaints our tent took a party out at 3 AM to put things right. But they got caught in a barrage - mostly gass - about half way out & had to spend some hours in a dugout then came home without doing anything 2 or 3 got gassed slightly & have been evacuated. A few shell came about the camp but no damage was done. Have done nothing all day
Friday 22ndWent out at 6 a m & nearly finished the job. Quite a hot day. Put some sand bags & dirt on our humpie to make it more secure from shrapnel & shell splinters- not sea shells -
