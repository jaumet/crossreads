<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I was very surprised to hear that Anna is down again with illness &amp; trust it won't be serious.  I was trying to explain on the 'phone about this night work.  A new order has just come out in which Percy, myself &amp; 4 others are put on the Permanent Night Staff.  This means that until we are called from here to go as Reinforcements or Base or anything else we will be on the Night work all the time.  It will suit me for we get just as much experience with the patients as we would on Day work.  We are going to put up a tent this morning for Night Dutymen only, so that we will be able to sleep undisturbed<br/>I am finding the Balaclava Cap very useful indeed these cold nights.<br/>I expect to be down on Wednesday afternoon.  I want to leave my watch in town to have it regulated &amp; inscribed, &amp; hope to take a run home.  If I am not home by 6 o'clock at the latest don't expect me till Thursday night.<br/>Must close now with love,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
