heat there were 3 rooms leading into one another the temperatures ranging from 160 (degrees) to 220 needless to say we did not patronise the latter much it was like a little Hell, we sat down on chairs for a good time they were red hot,  an hour we had to stop here when we had enough we had to ring the bell for the attendant I can tell you I was mighty glad when the time was up we were covered with sweat dirt grease our cloths chairs were saturated our heads felt like bursting you could see the dirt on our bodies quite easily, I came out first we went into a little room laid down on a marble slab which had been washed down with warm water, on here I got a good spraying with water then massaged all over with rough gloves soap then more spraying rubbing then into a bonza shower which fairly bit into your body
