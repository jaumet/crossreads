<p>Tis my afternoon off &amp; 6 of us are felluccering on the Nile &ndash; Very soon it will be unsafe for a month before the rising and 2 after they say it is dangerous.</p>
<p>Monday 7th  As we were driving near the Kair-el-Nil barracks last eve, a band and crowd attracted our attention &amp; on going to see what it was found it to be the 2500 Turkish prisoners marching through Cairo &ndash; I had my little camera &amp; took some snaps.  The poor things how tired and weary &amp; thin they looked, such a ragamuffin lot &ndash; scarcely one had a decent pair of boots on &amp; Their Torn &amp; patchy semi-uniform was pitiful to see.  The British line on either side with their bayonets was quite a contrast, but nothing as far as appearance goes could top our Anzacs.  Werent we pleased to have seen them, but I couldn't get the thought of their woe-be-gone expression out of my mind &amp; sincerely wished they would soon have a feed a bath &amp; a rest.  I looked &amp; gazed at them &amp; can quite understand now why our boys bear them no animosity &ndash; really they looked so kind hearted (not like fighting men) &amp; I'm sure they were pleased to be our prisoners.</p>
<p>Matron will be disappointed to be away &ndash; Tis the first time she has left us, &amp; The wounded coming in.</p>
