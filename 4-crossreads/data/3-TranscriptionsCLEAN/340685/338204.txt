4.7.16 Still here and rumours all day as to when we are to go. Now it is supposed to-morrow at 9 o'clock and I have a suspicion it is to Ypres. Things were of course scrambled all day and it also worked up a thunderstorm this afternoon with a little rain. Had an examination of myself today and oh heavens I am covered in lice - in an awful mess. However it is very unpleasant to write and still worse to bear both morall mentally and physically & yet everyone seems to have them and I emptied about half a tin of insectibane over myself. News of the advance still continues hopeful but I fear the war will not be ended shortly as such a lot think. Had a hair cut to-day at last. Slept pretty rottenly.5.7.16 Attended first parade at 6 o'clock and found I was on guard and went on at 9 o'clock. Only 12 in the guard and we had a fairly easy time of it. I getting to bed at 1 o'clock and waking about 7. The rats are fearful here too and run all over one even if you aim an object at them they don't trouble.6.7.16 had the morning off after guard dismounting at 9 and we went down to the baths and I had a thoroughly good wash which may help. At one we went on parade and  after a delay we were to do some demolitions but after joining two fuses and lighting them we were dismissed about 3.30 and the officers hurried off to practice driving the tool limbers. Soon afterwards a messenger came up and it now transpires we are to carry on with our ordinary work here to-morrow and are attached temporarily to the 3rd Brigade 4th Division. Still fair news coming through. Two letters to-night one each from Melva and mother. Took a good while to get to sleep as parasites were active and I was tired.7.7.16 Little rifle drill this morning and then some demolition work. We blew up various things and it was good practice. In the afternoon we blew up a fougasse using 5 lbs of Ammonal a small grained grey high explosive and stones which were splinters up. Took our blankets out again to-day but it appears we are booked here for a while now.
