  
 Those men who he left out there, the men with whom he had shared joys and sorrows, trials and hardship for months on end.- He starts from his reverie and looks at his one lasting souvenir of the War- an artificial limb- and then out of the window again.  He has felt the call but it must go unanswered.  He smiles wistfully and picks up his pen once more, but still the call had come and would keep on coming while war lasts.      To one and all that call comes, by some it must go unanswered through force of circumstance but to those others it does not pass unheeded, it bears no refusal. Waratah. 26.12.17. Initials.
