<p>Flessells 3/12/16  Dull and cold.  All the twigs on the bare trees covered with icicles which drop off and strew the ground underfoot.  Marched through the village and out to a piece of open ground for Church Parade.  All the Brigade was drawn up in a hollow square with a Band.  General Birdwood attended.  The little Padre preached well and shortly.  Very cold standing there but all men had on their greatcoats and their sheepskin gloves.  After the service the General presented DCMs and Military Medals to the men who have won them &ndash; a simple ceremony.  French peasants passing stopped to watch the gathering.  After the service the officers stood fast while the men returned to billets at the double.  The General had a few words to say about care of feet etc.  After lunch went with all Coy. Commanders to the Divn School &ndash; an old chateau still occupied in part by the Marquise.  Dated 1740 it has an old tower of the 11th century and we assembled for a lecture by Col. Bridges G.C.O.1, in an old little hall &ndash; apparently a banqueting hall which had an old walled up gallery for the musicians.  The lecture was on the "Duties of Officers".  It was very cold for the floor was flagged.  Pitch dark when we came out into the open again.  Held Orderly Room &ndash; a job I hate and had to punish hard two jolly good men for missing their train at Amiens.</p>
