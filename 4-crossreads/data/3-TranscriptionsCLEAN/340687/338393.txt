  
 All alone here now. Man permanently on tanks. Pumped in afternoon and collected some wood and also a bundle of papers of secret intelligence old left by D.H.Q. and specimens of two new bombs. After work read these interesting papers giving guns and men opposed on this front as well as every imaginable bit of information re Fritz mostly gleaned from prisoners and judicious observations. Read till after 11. Day squally with fair wind.
