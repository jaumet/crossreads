<p>activity was great a couple of Taubes coming over.  The sky was alive with planes in all directions.  At any time looking in any one direction one could count anything up to sixty in number.  Our bearers relieved today &amp; mighty glad they were too.  They found the best method of moving patients in fact was to draw them along on sledges over the mud.  One horse &amp; two men to a sledge.  Casualties were small owing to shells buring themselves in the mud.  The burst going straight up, shrapnel accounted for what there were.</p>
<p>Monday 6th Nov.<br/>Another two days of rain &amp; mud.  Our chaps, the 1st &amp; 2nd divisions, went over after some trenches &amp; the result is still in doubt.  Casualties were not heavy considering the job but they will all mount up.  Conditions very severe indeed for all ranks.  Had a few Germans through some of whom spoke English.  One evidently very frightened said, God strafe England, no! no! England very good. 'Tis a sight to see how the chaps go for souvenirs off these chaps, cutting of their buttons &amp; such like.  In fact with our own fellows, if a chap gets wounded &amp; has a particularly good pair of boots or such like, he is lucky if he gets far, someone will take them off ostensibly to make the patient more comfortable.  I heard a great tale of woe from one fellow, he saw a man being buried with top boots on &amp; was unable to interfere to save them.  'Tis a callous life</p>
