<p>My dear Father</p>
<p>Sunday again; so here&#39;s for my letter home. No more mail from you, yet, I don&#39;t know what has gone wrong with it. Any letters from Cairo come straight out to me and last nightI got two letters from Telarah dated 23rd Nov. and the last from home are 23rd Oct. I think it is that these letters have come since I wrote to the base and those from home <s>has </s>arrived before and were sent to hospital after that other Wilson and will be returned to me in a day or two with &quot;not at 14th ACH&#39; all over them. I rode over to our flying corps ityesterday to have a look round and see Mac Namara who is in the wireless there.</p>
<p>I did not see Mac as he was out with a battery somewhere North of Jerusalem, but I had an interesting time and also met Ronald Austin. He and another officer (our late sig. officer) had brough(t) down a tank the day before which I expect will help on there string of ribbons a bit, they have both got a good many already.</p>
