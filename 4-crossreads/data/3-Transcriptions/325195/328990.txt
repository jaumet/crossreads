<p>This morning Nelson &amp; I had to into Mule gully where we met the Sergeant &amp; senior Cpl from the 2nd&amp; 3rd also Srg-Major Latham who took us around &amp; showed us where each others lines ran. So as we should be able to know them in case any of them got cut by a bullet or any other cause; We were on duty at FRA till 6 oclock last night &amp; I had to leave Les &amp;Reid to attend to the work  while I went to Bde; I got back to camp after an interesting walk round Destroyers Hill &amp; Camel Hump &amp; back to camp through FRA &amp; FH . made some jam tarts this afternoon out of flour, suet, sugar &amp; jam. cooked them in fat, &amp; they turned out real good. We have been keeping what little flour we get for some time hoping for Baking Powder, but I now think I can produce better pastry without. Came on duty at FH at 5 oclock.</p>
