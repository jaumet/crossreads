<p>Tuesday 25 February 1919<br/>Rafa<br/>Khamsin blowing hard &ndash; our men have nothing left of equipment &amp; the drill is now ABC Infantry &ndash; like my Diary rather uninteresting, but one has to listen to a "Talker" and a man need not &amp; read.  Lectures are also given by poor Amateur lecturers, the men cursing all the time &ndash; it is a great waste of time for every one.  One Officer who has been drunk for 3 weeks is detailed to give a lecture to N.C.Os. on the <u>duty</u>!!! of N.C.Os. in the field.  Can you not imagine the Bolshie feelings of those men.</p>
