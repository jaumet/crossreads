Rafa &ndash; Border Police Station etc. Am afraid not very interesting viz. March 30. Glad alls well at home. Later letters June 9 &amp; Diary but please be more careful about people. MURGHA MACK'S people would be terribly distressed at printing CANCER. MACK is here &amp; much annoyed at it. Many thanks letters of June 9th &amp; Papers. HOWELL FOSTER  is NOWEL FORTH!!.</p>
