 Saturday 3rd July 1915 
 Watch on bridge 8 am to 12 noon &ndash; 8 pm to midnight &ndash; a stormy day with fierce head winds &amp; rain squalls.  Passed Albany to the northward, a good many miles south at about mid-day.  "Berrima" proved herself a good sea boat but a perfect devil  as far  for shipping seas f'ward.  Our mess deck frequently drenched down companion way &amp; saloon deck wet all over.  Heard frequent complaints about uncomfortable conditions aboard, men smoking in latrines &amp; lavatories to avoid dampness overhead. 
 Sunday 4th July 1915 
 A brighter day &ndash; sunshine with pleasant southward breeze &ndash; mess orderly.  Watch duties cancelled by Captain of ship. 
 Monday 5th July 1915 
 Monotonous day &ndash; buck concert at night &ndash; the monotony of the voyage is depressive &amp; becoming more accentuated every day.  Due west of Sydney at noon.
