 As expected stringent orders have come out concerning trench feet making the officers directly responsible. The 5th Division has been the worst affected having 100 cases in one day against 2 cases from the adjoining division. Now various remedies are made compulsory. 1. The feet to be rubbed once a day with whale oil & rubbed twice without. 2. Gum boots to be worn in the trenches. 3. A drying room to be provided for socks & each man to always have at least 1 pair dry. 4. Puttees not be worn in the trenches & bootlaces loosened. 5. One hot meal & drink at night. 6. Exercise to be taken preferably in improving the trench. These are the chief items & are supposed to be the result of two years experience.
