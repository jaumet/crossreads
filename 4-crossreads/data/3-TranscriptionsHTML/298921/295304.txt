<p>Saturday December 11 1915<br/>The Hospital Boats always look so comfortable &amp; close, we can hear the hours being rung on the Bells while on <u>our</u> Beats and in comparison to our darkness on shore<br/>They show up brilliantly &ndash; green lights with a big Red X amidships. This morning 4 Battleships &amp; 2 Monitors bombarded one night, with Salvoes which made the hills tremble I guess Johnny Turk must have had some casualties poor beggars but what about the Armenians &ndash; fortnight to Xmas Day!!! I note you &amp; Day are sending Billies, which we all trust will arrive especially as we are on half rations.</p>
