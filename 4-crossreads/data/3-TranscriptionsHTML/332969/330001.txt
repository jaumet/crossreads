<p>14.2.16 Well I arrived back to my old unit yesterday. &amp; I can tell you. there was a great re union among old mates. <strike>We are ho</strike> at Tel-el-Kebi. We are having a good old time as we are in tents. I have been down to the old Cemetery where a lot of men are burried who fell in the battle of Tel-el-Kebi. the remains of the old trenches are still to be seen around the camp. The train line runs quite close to the camp.</p>
