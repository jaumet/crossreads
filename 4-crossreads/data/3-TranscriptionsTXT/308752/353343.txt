experience it had been whilst living amidst the land of sand & filth. It is indeed a land of "Mystery". Menu for meals on Sunday 18th inst. Breakfast. About 4 tablespoons of porridge containing hard lumps like suet but with no milk or sugar. Thick black coffee also without milk. A piece of bread about as big as a cricket ball & butter as much as would cover a florin. Of course art mid-day most of the fellows were just about famished. Dinner. A couple of potatoes (in their jackets) & a piece of meat about 4 in. square. 1/4 cup of soup, the latter was very good, but not nearly enough. Of course no bread or tea issued for this meal. Tea. Bread, a piece of butter about the same amount as issued for breakfast, & a dessertspoonful of jam. The three meals put together would just about make a decent meal. Saw some of the Officers tucker being cooked, roast chicken etc.   Every man has been issued with a life belt, these must be worn or must be always at hand, any one found without one will be severely crimed. The sun-set this evening was very beautiful. Bob & I stood on the bow & gazed at the beautiful sight, the splendour of it cannot be described in words. The glorious sea breeze was delightful after the heat that all had experienced last 6 months.
Monday 19th June.6 a.m.  Bob Roberts, Esbert Smith & I are all sitting in the bow enjoying the beautiful sea air, ship just beginning to roll. All feel very hungry & another two hours to wait for breakfast. An impressive Church parade was conducted by our friend Captain Ward on the Aft Deck. He & I seem to be following each other about. I intend taking him down to our cosy bed rooms where sun never penetrates & very little fresh air is found, it will be an eye opener for him.
Land sighted, turned out to be the Island of Crete (can be easily found on the map).
