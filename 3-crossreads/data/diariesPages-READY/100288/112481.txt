out of action; made rather an easy day of it for us all. On our return we were all notified that we were to be given pack drill at 5 pm, for an hour, for failing to fall in smartly at 2.45 AM, when preparing to leave camp; rather stiff at that time of the morning. As usual we made light of it, the humorous side of it overshadowed the rest; Very fine report from the G.O.C. who inspected us yesterday
