  
 Aug 16th [1914] The "Yarra" (destroyer) at 6 AM was sent out on patrol duties, as the mouth of the river was patrolled all day from dawn to dusk, as during dark hours all ships were darkened; nothing unusual happened during the day, and Yarra returned to anchorage at 6 P.M.  A large oil tank was observed way out on the horizon, and she was known to be on her way to our rendezvous, her name being "Physa", as she was showing the necessary lights she was plainly visible, and she was ordered to drop anchor outside the Lagoon, and done so at 9.30 P.M. 
 Aug 17th  Yarra again left at 6 AM on patrol duties and at the same time she was ordered to lead the oiltank thru channel into Lagoon after which Yarra departed, whilst Physa came alongside of us at 8 A.M. and Warrigo tied up the other side of 'Physa' and we commenced to take in oil. 
 At 9-15 AM our Captain exercised battle stations
