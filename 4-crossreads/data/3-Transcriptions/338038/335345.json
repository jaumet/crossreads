<p>France 13.5.1917<br/>My dear Father,</p>
<p>Many many thanks for your two letters of 14th &amp; 18th Mar, also post cards from Swain's &ndash; Jove!  What a host of recollections that one of Rushcutters Bay brings back &ndash; of the trips in "Culwulla" with Marles and "Tempest" with old McGale, coming home in the evening burnt as red as lobsters but feeling like a race-horse in training! &ndash;</p>
<p>Your letters as usual are full of interest Father, and fortunately when they arrived last night I had finished work for the time being, so had an uninterrupted hour to sit and read them through. I am of course following the Brothers movements very closely</p>
