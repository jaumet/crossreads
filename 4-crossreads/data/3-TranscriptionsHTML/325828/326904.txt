<p>through my belongings the other day I came across this &amp; decided to send it on to you, as it is my first impressions of France.<br/>I see I have said in it that Cousin Ray or Bert as he calls himself is in Headquarters.  This should read Brigade Headquarters, whereas I am in Divisional HdQtrs so don't come into touch with him at all<br/>Much love,<br/>from Leo</p>
