Time for sight seeing. There is a nice Town not very far away and I must have a try to see some of it. it will be the first time I have had an opportunity to see a decent french town and if I am granted leave it will be the first in france for I have never had a pass on this side of the water as I have never been near a place that was really worth seeing except when we were Travelling. Now there is little more to tell you just yet. So I will ring down the curtain. Heaps of love to all especially yourself and Mother from your Loving Bro. Chas. G.
Did I tell Mother in my last letter that I had a letter from Bea. my letter reached her Safely at Omdurman.
