<p>Taken place in any other part of the city they would not have known anything about it but being on the route to the train they of course got into it &amp; from the treatment they got naturally resented it, of this number the majority were handed over to the guard I sent from the ship with no crime against them, they were ready kept in the lock up all night, then no charge could be made against them, I am very indignant at the newspaper comment as I know the men did not misbehave &amp; had kept their promise to me in this respect, of course as a soldier I am disbarred from making any public protest, but do think that someone else should, in justice to the men in the Osterley.</p>
<p>Trusting that you will have a pleasant holiday &amp; with kind regards to Mrs Ferguson &amp; yourselve.</p>
<p>Believe me<br/>Yours sincerely</p>
