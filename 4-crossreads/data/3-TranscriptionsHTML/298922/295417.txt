<p>Sunday 1 April 1917</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  4600 Casualties at Gaza so far 600 Killed &ndash; Tanks &ndash; Howitzers not yet in. Papers will tell you I can't coz of Censor but it is a big fight at Gaza still. Another Parcel tonight from Mother &ndash; 2 cakes chocs. etc. &amp; Punch &ndash; thank you all so much.</p>
<p>Went to Church &amp; stayed for Communion. I'm not a hyprocrite, I hope, but our Padre GORDON is leaving us &amp; he is a really good man &amp; has done a lot for all ranks in our Brigade &ndash; just heard GAZA is evacuated &amp; Turksretreating. We move up in a few days. This is now only a yarn 1st April about GAZA.</p>
