after this a yarn to the girls then we went out to have a look round the town book a room for the night, after this we went saw the "Better Ole" at the only so called theatre here, well it was the most rotten stale thing that I have ever seen whatever the people could see to laugh applaud beat me, I was yawning nearly the whole time I was mighty glad when the show was over. I then went back to these people had supper 2 other chaps I rode back on our bikes Len having decided to stop the night, it was a glorious night I really enjoyed our midnight trip, but half way I got a puncture which we soon fixed up, I eventually arrived home at 1.30 as I was coming across the parade
