1916   MONDAY 30   OCTOBER
Fine. Got a car into Salisbury & got an early train to London. Went straight to the Regents Palace Grovosner Court & saw Auntie Florence & Mrs Angus. Went round London & did some business in morning & saw the "Battle of the Somme" on the pictures at the "Scala" theatre in the afternoon. We all went to the Opera "Samson et Delilah" at night & it was beautiful. I got the 11.15 pm train to Edinburgh from Euston afterwards.
