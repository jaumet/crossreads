<p>6.  It was only an Hour to go then so I was not weary at all.<br/>This morning between 8 am &amp; 9 am we had Hail, rain, snow &amp; sunshine.  What do you think of that?  It has been fine all the afternoon but a nice sharp March wind has been blowing.  Now, Mum &amp; Dad &amp; George, it is after lights out &amp; I am pretty tired so I will ring off.  Ellis is nice &amp; snug in bed but mine is not made yet.  I've had supper &amp; the fire is not yet out but I still like to be beneath the blankets early.<br/>Give Best Wishes to all the Neighbours &amp; to Mrs Keirle too.  Reg. was over again to-day.  He only stays about 30 minutes &amp; He's off again.  I met a Manly Boy named May in the Strand on Sunday.  Lieut. May who was killed from Manly was His Brother or Cousin I'm not sure which.<br/>Regards also to Mr &amp; Mrs Ali &amp; the Dobsons &amp; Buntings.<br/>Best Love from<br/>Harry &amp; Ellis</p>
