 All sorts of hearsay float about as to what&nbsp;is going to be done with us, but there is little that is definite at all. &nbsp;The Education Scheme seems to be taking a bit of shape, but being scattered like Pa&#39;s Cows, I don&#39;t know what our Unit is doing at all. 
 There is little news to mention, but I may be able to drop a few lines in a few days, by when possibly some October mail may have reached us.

 Fondest love to Dad Bess &amp; Lock, 
 Your loving Son James xxxxxx
