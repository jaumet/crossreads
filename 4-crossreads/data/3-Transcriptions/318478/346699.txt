<p>Feb. 22nd 1919</p>
<p>Today I was invited to go with Bean and most of our party for a tour of the positions on our left flank, and although it has been a long tiring day it was most enjoyable.  We have now with us a Turkish Major lent to us by H.Q. &amp; Turkish Commissioners, with a view to helping Bean with the History.  He carries on conversation in French, a language which Bean does well and I "compred assez" so we are getting valuable help from him;  also I hope to get him to sit for me.  This evening two minions arrived from nowhere who are to "look after him", but I fancy they, poor devils come in for a feed, as the Turk officer doesn't seem to remember any order that was issued commanding to report.  However they too will make excellent models.  One of em has a uniform of which at least six square inches is of the original issue, <strike>and remains much worn in its original position</strike>.<br/>[Drawing]<br/>Referring to the tour of today, our itinerary took us along the beach and on towards Suvla Bay &amp; the Salt Lake, where Dugdale, by the bye, saw action.  The country in this direction grows more &amp; more picturesque and fertile valleys or pockets with bits of cultivation &amp; olive groves break up the monotonous sandy</p>
