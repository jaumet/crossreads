25/4/17Favreuil, Ervillers, Gomiecourt, Mory, Sapignies.With G J. ONeill rode off across country to get in touch with the H.Q. of 185 & 186 Brigades with whom I am on liaiason Reached L'homme Mort after inquiring of sundry Tommies and saw B.M. there and their General. Rode across country to Ervillers and found General Hill 186th British Brigade and discussed action and barrages with him. Then to Gomiecourt and saw B.M. 185th about similar things. Both these villages are a heap of rubbish and nothing else having been absolutely torn to bits not by gun fire but by such means as knocking out walls etc so that the roof collapses. The British tommies in these places were very punctilious about paying compliments and markedly different to ours. Came back through Sapignies having a good ride which would have been even more enjoyable had the weather not been dull. In the afternoon officiated as judge at sports, today being a holiday on account of being Anzac Day. Unearthed some fine athletes. Much struck by how dirty the men are in person & clothes owing to no baths. Long hair prevalent too owing to packs being back in dump. Cold evening and smoky brazier turned us into black-a-moors with its fumes
