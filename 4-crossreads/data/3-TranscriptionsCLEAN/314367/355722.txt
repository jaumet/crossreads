Grasping their ideas does me at any rate much good - It stiffens you me for the day's work - Sick parade at 8.30 - J. barely punctual - What a born parasite, waster & loafer lurks inside his weary skin!! I hate a person I cant trust & I cant trust - J - Well - never mind - I work him & that's the best thing to do - The sea is as molten glass & I like being at sea - I keep my crowd healthier - I am very anxious to have a good record of health & to lose no one - Tell R - I sang out to the Physical Instructor this morning to look at the men's mouths - All open - Shut them I told him - Breathe thro their noses - He made them quick & lively - When a man is all out - every atom out - breathe anyhow I think - otherwise use the nose -
