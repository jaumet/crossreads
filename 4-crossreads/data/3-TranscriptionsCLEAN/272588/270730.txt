  
 Sunday 30 June At Strazeele Station R.A.P. where things have been fairly quiet except for shelling this morning when the Boshe attempted to raid the battalion on our left but came a Gutzer losing machine guns & prisoners.  Our guns put up a ten minutes straafe at midday. A 'plane came down between the lines, one of ours with engine trouble, but both men are unhurt;  they were 10000 feet in the air when the trouble showed itself & they volplaned down landing between two of our posts. Several cases have recurred lately of our shells hitting our 'planes, being caught in barrages, men being of course killed.  Also a couple of 'planes have collided. A couple of cases last night. Several of our own shells have been falling in our own line.
