As she came abreast the A13 she was belching thick black smoke from her funnels, &amp; the water was pouring over her bows on account of her speed. Her guns were out &amp; decks cleared &amp; the remaining articles of furniture etc that are left until the last minute, were being thrown overboard. She soon faded out of sight astern so, summing things up, I told Captain Jackson at breakfast time &amp; he asked that a watch be kept for news. The cruiser Sydney kept in touch with H.M.A.S. Melbourne but being all in code we could not decipher it. It was about the fight between the Sydney &amp; Emden however. At midnight that night we had passed Cocos Island about fifteen miles off &amp; the Emden was close around there. (See the official description of battle at end of this book for a reliable account) Evidently the Emden's intentions were to destroy Cocos Island radio station, cut her submarine cables, thereby isolating her from the world &amp; then attack us at night from the rear. She would never have put up a fight, with a hope of winning but she would have torpedoed the rear transports</p>
