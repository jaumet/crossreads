<p>Friday. Feb. 21.<br/>It's mighty hot again but as our ship is making good progress that doesn't matter much. Judging by the news were heard at [indecipherable] &amp; Port Said we are having an excellent trip so far as the Health of the Troops are concerned. The "Margha" &amp; "Ceramic" had quite a big death roll by the time they reached here. We have about 20 in hospital but none of them are very ill. For Breakfast we had fish, which wasn't too good. Yank brought us in some Roast Beef sandwiches about 6 this morning &amp; some tea. After getting outside that I got up &amp; had a Bath.<br/>A cool breeze sprang up after Tea which made things a bit more comfortable.<br/>What a rotten writer I am getting I must blame the rolling of the ship.<br/>Sat. Feb.22<br/>Corp. Brown, our mental patient seems to be feeling the heat somewhat.<br/>It must be rotten to be that way. The Food is beginning to get that nasty "ship" taste, &amp; some days it is not too good. Still we cannot growl so far, as it must be a difficult task to provide appetising meals every day.</p>
<p>This is our second week gone &amp; the trip has been very pleasant.</p>
