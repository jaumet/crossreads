 November 1918. Monday 11 
 Hosptl. Birmingham 
 Weather fine and clear, went into town with Johnson.  News of armistice having been signed by the Hun arrived at this place at 10.15pm. the wildest scenes of excitement in town, everyone went mad. There were some very pretty sights.  Leave extended to 8 pm and we had a few nice btts of Bubbly to celebrate the occasion. Tis a very hard job to describe my emotions at the news, and I think that twould be a hard thing for anyone to do so.
