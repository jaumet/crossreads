<p>Wednesday 21/3/17<br/>The Hun sent a H E shell (5.9) into Pont de Nieppe just about dusk to night  killing 4 soldiers &amp; 3 civilians (inc 2 children)  Our cars &amp; boys brought them in.

<p>SOME SHRAPNEL</p>
<p>Very good incitement [?] this morning which however ended in one of our boys being a casualty.  As is customary every morn our Section does physical culture to keep fit &amp; this morning we were on this routine in the courtyard when a Fritz plane came across &amp; sighted us.  Consequently in about &frac12; hr (we were still at culture) whizzing over came a shell &amp; we were soon on our stomach.  Never worried much &ndash; thought it was a stray &amp; went on again why again &ndash; this time she burst in air not far away but we had taken every precaution &amp; no one was hurt.  We then received orders to get inside the billets &amp; the Hun kept us his shrapnel all the morning.</p>
