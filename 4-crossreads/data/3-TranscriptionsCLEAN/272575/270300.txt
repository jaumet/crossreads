The Camp Commandant happens to be Colonel Batteye and he is not liked as well as Colonel Kirkland so you can guess that he is hardly to be envied he sent Pickets into Perth with fixed Bayonets to keep us in order, and I think they did more harm than good, I pitied them, for awhile, they were kept marching up and down and wherever they halted a crowd soon collected when the window smashing was in progress    They made matters worse by trying to hunt the crowd back then the mounted police came out but they did not last long, I will say one thing for the W.A. Police they had enough common sense to keep them from rousing the boys up too much, they confined themselves to seeing that the crowds were not allowed to block the footpaths altogether, the  chief sufferer was a German Tobacconist they smashed a window of one of his shops, and smashed the both windows and the glass door of the second then in the early morning they looted the place, and some of the men carried their share of the spoil about the town
