Handguard wood was in front full of Huns about 300 yards off we could see them moving about during the day &amp; it had been raining a lot, fine drizzling rain which soon made our new trench sloppy &amp; as it was a narrow one we had to stand all the time.</p>
<p>I began to feel crook &amp; was shivering with the wet &amp; cold as it was now April &amp; as we got orders to leave our overcoats behind, we only had waterproof capes to keep out the wind &amp; rain &amp; I started to vomit &amp; to feel dead crook so at night the officer told me I had better see the doctor so went out as soon as I could get away at dusk.</p>
<p>one of the Huns had several shots at me with a rifle as I left the trench to go back to the old one but he never hit me so I got back to Company Headquarters &amp; from there we picked up a wire that was pegged down &amp; by letting it pass through your Hand we were guided down to Batt. Head Quarters where I saw the Battalion doctor who examined me &amp; as I had trench feet &amp; Trench fever I was evacuated to no 7 field Ambulance where they washed my feet &amp; wrapped them in big cotton wool bandages &amp; towards morning we were carried to an ambulance &amp; taken to Amiens &amp; passed through the Clearing station where we got some welcome Hot coffee &amp; Bread &amp; Butter then in another ambulance to the Ambulance Train &amp; went to no 12 Hospital at Rouen where I was three weeks in bed with high Temperatures &amp;</p>
