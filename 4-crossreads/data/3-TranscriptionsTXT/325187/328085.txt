[Friday 8 December 1916]
Usual Reconnaissance same as last July but- Days cooler & nights really cold-The desert has more life now, small birds Plovers etc but no water beyond the gallon a day & Salt WELL NO TENTS, & issued rations only, I'm soft & fat & will feel it for the first few nights I expect.Glad to hear that J.D.Meredith is on his way back.(PRIVATE I should get my Majority i.e. Major inside 6 months with luck.) My Bivouac is built of Blankets & Jim Ayres is a Trooper not far away-Had to cut all my HAIR off close again-Salt Water & Sand not a good Hair Wash.
