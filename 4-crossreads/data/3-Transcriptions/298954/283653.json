<p>Thu 23rd (cont.)<br/>Number 10 is a long felt-walled barrack divided off into officers, underofficers, day workers, French, &amp; many divisions.   The officers quarters are full, sayeth authority, and a number of us needs must camp in the underofficers quarters, including Sandy (3rd "Wordsworth"), Geo., Buck, Heck, Fraser, &amp; Smith.   Everything and everybody is more or less filthy and the smell from the numerous open cesspits is omnipresent and overpowering.</p>
<p>My stable companions at number 10 include a number of travling skippers captured in the North Sea.   Bob, Geo. Pyne, &amp; self formed a Mess.   We cook what little we have to cook on the beach by the clay-pit.   (Pardon!.   The Lake is the correct term here.)   We are "on the Beach" metaphorically as well as literally.</p>
<p>Sun. 26th.<br/>In Brandenburg with Geo.    This place place is the very heart of Military Germany;   the Prussian Aldershot.</p>
