 I sat in the trench at Broodesind Ridg and listen to our S.O.S. Barrag , our Trial Barrag , and The Barrag befor the Hopov . as well as sever minor stunt I began to understand a littl about Artilleri fire that day , and I dont like it , I can assur you , it right enough , when you know the shell are not for you , but you also know , when it start that you have not long to wait for your share , and friend fritz can be veri spite when he like . . At Hermi I saw a plane brought down , one of our , just after it land , " a broken heap of materi , " fritz open up on it with a 5.9. but tri as he would , he could not hit it , so he rake the ground around it , with H.E. Shrapnel , what his idea was I do not know . The old tank too , that he has manag to put out of action , get quit a lot of attent from him , but though his artillerymen do some veri fine group practic , when shoot at these stationari target . I have never seen a direct hit , it is when they select a certain area , and commenc to sow it broadcast that they do the damag One day in Octr Last I watch their heavi shell tear the place to piec in amongst some of our batteri and all the time the gunner were busi move the gun twice I saw heap of ammunit set on fire besid the gun , but the gun were not hit , just behind them as a small truck load with timber , and after awhil a lucki shell caught it , fair centr , There was a sudden and swift , depreci in the valu of that truck Timber doubtless , had the gunner , been abl to observ the effect of that particular shot , they would have boast about their fine shoot , but still they do shoot well , though our gun give them no peac , and general make thing so hot for them that they shut up . I believ that for awhil there was a veri strong Idea amongst the Armi leader on our side that the Hun would make a push somewher on this particular sector , and fritzi , I believ drop pamphlet tell the civilian that he intend dine in one of the big town not far from here , on Xmas day , but no push came off , so the rumour may have been true and it may not , one thing , there was a veri nice recept wait had he come . . You spoke in your letter of the fight which I presum Alf Phillip got his ticket , Gaza , well the paper at first over here , claim all sort of thing for our side , then later came the report of the commiss which follow . The busi was rotten enough , but still someon must make mistak , if the whole truth were just laid out befor the public , each time the public would learn some strang thing , still sooner or later , the truth must come out , the Messopotamia commiss show everyon that much . If I could tell you the exact locat of our present quarter , I would , but as you know , it is not safe to do so , such is the care with which the militari guard against ani news that might be of use to Fritzi , escap . . Yet , the civilian in near ani district that we have yet been in can tell us day befor , if we are move , and where we are go , "funni is n't it ? we must not say it in a letter home .
