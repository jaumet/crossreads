The Scott Monument close to Waverley station is a very fine piece of work, another Sgt I climbed right to the top from it you can see all over Edinburgh, she is 200 ft in height, has 287 steps, the Architect was a shepherds son George M. Kemp, there is a little story connected with this monument when they were putting the last stone in position right on top they found their machinery was just a couple of inches short the great stone hung in the air they did not know what to do it was a drunken sailor who showed them how to get the few inches, he done it by simply wetting the ropes causing them to shrink the stone was placed in position, it took 4 years to build was opened in 1844 costing 15600.
Edinburgh is rich in statues monuments some of them very fine costly.
