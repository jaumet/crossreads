<p>at seven fifteen for Alexandria Station.</p>
<p>Thousands of bales of cotton were lying at the station. This cotton is grown in Egypt.</p>
<p>Huge tracks of country are covered with water.</p>
<p>Large numbers of native labourers are making roads and digging the canals deeper.</p>
<p>This part of Egypt is splendidly irrigated by a splendid system of canals.</p>
<p>Impressions this time are pretty much as I have already described in the earlier part of my diary.</p>
<p>No hedges or fences divide the various fields one from another, the furrow seems to mark out the field.</p>
<p>Oranges are in great demand by the "boys" and are eagerly bought up by them from the native sellers at the various stops on the way. The familiar o-ran-ges "Eggs are cooked", of the natives sounds extremely amusing.</p>
<p>Along the road which runs by the side of the canal and railway little buildings like monuments are placed at intervals of a few miles. There seems to be wells placed there to quench the thirst of the travellers who seem to be numerous along the way.</p>
<p>We saw a number of native youngsters holding a net in the canal. How fish could live in such water I cannot understand. The water is so very muddy. Travelling rapidly in the train one could not see what kind of catch they were getting.</p>
