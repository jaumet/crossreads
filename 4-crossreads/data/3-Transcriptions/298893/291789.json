<p>Capt Hale.<br/>Referring to Div Order 61 Par 285 (Care of Gas Sprayers)<br/>The order says that fluid for Sprayers is to be kept in jars handy to the Sprayers.<br/>If the Sprayers are not ready filled at the time of Gas Alarm a lot of time will be taken in pouring fluid from jars into Sprays.<br/>I examine the Sprays every second day &amp; stir the chemicals up &amp; today I am cleaning the machines out.<br/>Please let me know if it is necessary for me to put the whole of the fluid into jars or only the extra charges.<br/>A Gray<br/>RSM</p>
