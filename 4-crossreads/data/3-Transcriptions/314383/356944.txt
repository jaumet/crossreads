<p>Aug 26</p>
<p>I am again running a temp and haven't been able to eat a bite all day.</p>
<p>Aug 27<br/>Feet &amp; ankles out like baloons. Guess its Berri Berri.  Dr. says I must go to Hamadan with convoy tomorrow.  Wonder if its better to use my revolver.</p>
<p>Nov 15th<br/>Colaba Bombay.</p>
<p>The old diary has been locked up in my valise which I haven't been able to open since leaving Hamadan.  I have lost all count of time since that day of Aug 28th when I did the 100 miles run in a Ford car to Hamadan.  I must have been delerious when I got here.  Woke up to find myself in a tent &amp; above all a bed even if the blankets were full of lice.  Influenza was raging during the three weeks I spent there &amp; a lot of our people died including Lake, Brophy &amp; Smithson.  The Turks made a thrust at Zenjan &amp; the Col in command at Hamadan</p>
