<p>5-1-16<br/>Wed 5th<br/>Had Regimental drill this morning, but broke out of the ranks to do signalling practice; Was issued with a pack horse at dinner time to carry signalling gear; Was also issued with signalling equipment (new) &amp; put the afternoon in doing nothing; Les received a pass from dinner time , &amp; I scaled off as soon as I had fed the horses &amp; taking the Kukri in to post it went to Cairo; Called to see Morgan as we went &amp; found him improving fast; Arthur &amp; Bottom went in with me &amp; we had a very enjoyable time, but found it was too late to send the Gurkhas's knife so left it at a cake shop where we are regular customers &amp; came back to camp early; Was surprised on weighing tonight to find I weigh 12 stone 5 lbs.</p>
