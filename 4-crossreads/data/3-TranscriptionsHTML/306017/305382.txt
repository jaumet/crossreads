<p>January 1917<br/>The New Year came in wet &amp; cold &amp; windy  On the 5th it fined up.  A &amp; B Troops went to Reuisat &amp; Zagadan.  Zagadan is 12 miles SE of our camp.  6 of us struck south from Zagadan &amp; followed out some Bedouin tracks in a westerly direction as it was too late to follow them East.  We came across the place where they had their goods &amp; chattels packed &amp; covered up.  We got papers &amp; next day sent out some pack horses for anything useful in their stack.</p>
<p>On the night of the 6th we got some more rain, but it fined up again next day.  More mail came in &amp; I got 2 parcels &amp; a few letters.  On the 9th the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Rafa on the Egyptian Border &amp; had a stiff fight eventually capturing the place.  The ground was bare &amp; without cover &amp; our casualties were over 500.  Over 2000 prisoners were taken &amp; the Turks had 600 casualties.  Our troops suffered some from British</p>
