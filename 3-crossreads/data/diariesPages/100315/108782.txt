14/4/18 ? Lavieville
Not at all a promising day for our relief ? dull low grey clouds. The Staff Captain was the first visitor and talks of a good many F.G.C.Ms pending. The S.O.S. was sent up on the 24th front last night and heavy bombardments commenced. The 21st tried to carry out a small raid on a post last night under artillery support but did no good, having 1 officer killed, 7 wounded and 3 missing. Rather a disastrous little show. The 7th Bde. succeeded in getting one prisoner. News continues to arrive of the Hun advance up
