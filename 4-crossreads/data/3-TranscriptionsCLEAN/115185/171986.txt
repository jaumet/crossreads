  
 4 - of course you would cable for me if you or Father was ill - and I could probably get home on transport duty. But I hope you wont be. I wonder so much about Willie and Gibson. I have Mother - your precious New York photograph on my table. The only photograph except some snapshots. I have had all the time - in my tent in my hut - & now here in Cairo. Your ever darling, loving face - always inspiring and comforting. It's an awfully sad time - all the Australians are moving - but we dont know where to. Both the other general hospitals are going, we stay here they say till August. I'll Cable if we move but I shall not know where to. Please give Bill & Edith & children my love. I'd love snapshots of them all. also of Constance & her family. I'd like - a Saturday Herald & a Wednesday Telegraph if you have time to post them. I got all you sent before. Devoted love to you my precious Father & Mother. Ever your loving daughter Beth McMillan
