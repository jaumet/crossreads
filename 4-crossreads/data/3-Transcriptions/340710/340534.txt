<p><u>Sambo.</u><br/>His name was Sambo.  He was employed to burn off the rubbish and keep our lines clean.  He lives in the village on the other side of the Canal and had sworn a vendetta on the people of the village to the north of Tel-el-Kebir.<br/>Those Arabs would come into the camp and sneak off with all kinds of clothing and food but Sambo's eagle eye wanders ever and anon around his domain and no stealthy native escapes him.<br/>He waylays and searches them and burns all he finds unless they happen to be useful to himself or his kinsmen, he then belabours them soundly and chases them off with a stick.<br/>Sambo setting off for his demesne is quite another</p>
