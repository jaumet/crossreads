  
 Should hate to get too fat. 
 We went to Afternoon tea to an Aust. Battalion on Tuesday   &  had a lovely afternoon. On Friday, three of us Dorothy, Annie Bell   &  self went with 3 officers to another C.C.S. Sports   &  it was awfully good. We were the only Australians there, so in the boom. 
 Sister Bell's brother is a M.O. here   &  a grand fellow, he came with us to the Sports. It is awfully nice for her to have her brother here. He is a  very clever surgeon. One of our Sisters went on Leave last Sunday   &  to-day
