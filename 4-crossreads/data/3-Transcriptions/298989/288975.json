<p>2/2/16<br/>Left Staging Camp at 0700 and rode out into the desert &ndash; the pack horses following. Very pleasant riding along past gaily clad gangs of natives on the road making job. Struck out into the sands &amp; picked up some landmarks to steer by. Not able to go much above a walk with the horse. Chaplain Stewart over for the day and my batman looking after him. Made Spendlove shave me and then settled up accounts. Bread a welcome addition to the menu of the mess.</p>
<p>After lunch rode out with Major Smith round our forward line and sited the trenches there. Fine trench usual winding communication trenches, supports, and "get away" to the keep in rear. Some pieces of pottery lying in the sand in places and also saw footprints of dogs. Turkish patrols seen today 15 miles out. Our agents report 13000 Turks at Beersheba and others scattered all over desert as outposts. Pte. Handasyde D Co Accountant Melb Herald age 54 enlisted to be with his son, the Sergt. &amp; now finds himself too old to keep up with the young men. Misguided patriotism for him to have come away putting his country to needless expense. A decent old chap.</p>
<p>3/2/16<br/>A lazy day. Strolled round in shorts cool wind but hot sun. "B" Coy did 10 mile route march. 6th F Engineers revetting the "keep" with hurdles &amp; matting. Major Pidgeon supervising French digging in our forward position, the men can stand their rifles upright in the sand but the practice affects the visibility of the picquets and has to be prohibited. Tried out some NCO's. "When I says Fix! You don't fix but when I says "Bayonets" you whips them out and whops them on!". Recruit with the rifle loaded, "10 cartridges in the tin box &amp; 1 in the funnel". Brushed up semaphore work and also tried the mekometer.</p>
