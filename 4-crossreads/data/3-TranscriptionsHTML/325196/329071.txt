<p>29.12.15<br/>Wed 29th<br/>Shifted into fresh tents this morning &amp; our Webb equipment was handed back to the Q.M. Ser. &amp; all our belongings are now lying loose in the tents; After dinner we were issued with saddles &amp; bridles &amp; then I asked  Major Smith (who is OC of C Sqd) if I could get 6 weeks furlough &amp; was told that I had no possible chance. I then asked for 4 days to go to Luxor next week but was told there was no chance &amp; that we would probably be going away again in 2 or 3 days so I had to be satisfied with leave to Cairo tonight Went in with Arthur &amp; Morgan &amp; had a good time at the Kursaal; having tea afterwards we met Bottomly &amp; had great fun coming back to Camp with a couple of Frenchmen.Bottom speaks French fluently &amp; is a character</p>
