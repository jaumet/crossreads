Entry 3rd Oct. 1917 - In small tent, sandbagged around, near Belgian Chateau.
Posted letters tody.
This morning I took a party of 30 through Ypres in a lorry to Birr Cross Roads & then we walked to near Westhoek. We banked up a cable from here back to Birr X roads about a mile. Heavy shells came over us & scattering & burning a few dumps but luckily we had no casualties. I examined a tank in a crater. It had evidently been mined. I got a piece of a tank shell case from it. We have not used the tanks much lately. No one who has not seen Ypres can ever imagine the wreckage of beautiful buildings there. It is the worst I have seen for a large town. I have seen smaller towns on the Somme & near Messines totally obliterated except for a few bricks here & there, but for a city like Ypres, it is terrible
