April 1917Tuesday 17Moved out at 7 pm last night. Travelling in the dark towards enemy poz fired on by an outpost (11LH) at 50 yds range, only 1 horse shot. Dismounted in a wadi and advanced on foot. Took up a position on a ridge before daylight. Turks opened fire on us at daylight. After about 2 hours here we advanced. Brig and Dave galloped thro hail of bullets and shells telling us to keep down. The din of guns awful. Brig and Dave galloped up again telling us to advance.
Shortly after several Turks were sighted with white flags. Several men and officers [indecipherable] that everything was [indecipherable] and ceased fire and rushed forward. It was only a blind as half the Turks disappeared and then it came a hail of high explosive shrapnel. Lots of our chaps hit. We retired from this possie and took up a worse one, being under frontal and enfilading fire. Several more were shot. We retired and took up another pos and advanced. Had to run to a wadi for our lives under fire and shells, Disher killed in the wadi Capt Hamlyn wounded - we got out safely and joined up the firing line. Heard Dave was wounded also Fr Goodman and 9 other officers and Lt Throssell killed, retired to our horses. Travelled back a few miles in night.
Next day dug trenches and occupied them. I was out on listening  post.
SatCol Todd and Majore Grimood (10th LH) were wounded.
