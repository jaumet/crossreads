25/2/18 Selles
here rode out through Quesques on to the Ecoueville ridge from which a magnificent view is to be had. Walked all over this and decided on a plan for our attack practice. Back to BnH.Q. and tried a number of cases of overstaying leave which offence is becoming altogether too frequent. Old Crowley reverts to rank of Corporal at his own request. Fixed up some routine matters. My host at the billet complains of trees cut up and used by our men for fires and has claimed 100 francs therefore. This will be paid by the men concerned Our new Padre (Smith) was in to mess. Held a conference of officers afterwards.
