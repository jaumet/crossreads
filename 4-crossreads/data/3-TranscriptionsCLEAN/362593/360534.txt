  
 Friday 29 March 1918 Recco.  Pilot Capt. Addison, in air 3 h. 10 m.  Engine cut out on one side over Damie.  Reached Jericho. Visited the Jordan, very interesting and quite a pretty place. Took off to do recco.  Great storm comes up, we turn for home and fly through rain and mist for 11/2 hours over the hills round Jerusalem, at times doing 110 m.p.h. and badly raining. 
 Saturday 30 March 1918 At last news is received of Oliver Lee through a German wireless which states that 3 aviators have been captured near Kataani [possibly Katana].  Sure to be the three pilots that are missing, very pleased to get this news.
