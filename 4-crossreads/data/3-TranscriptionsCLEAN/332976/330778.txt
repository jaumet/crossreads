December 1916(27th continued)   ascertain the extent of repairs required & after dinner I distributed the party to the billets & we started on the work.  There is a lot of work to be done, consisting of chiefly the repair of bunks, construction of extra bunks & accomidation for the troops in general.28th   We continued with our work to-day & have made considerable progress.  To-night I & three others went to the vaudeville show about a mile distant from our billet.  Being held every night & financed by the Australian Comforts Fund, it is a great success & appreciated by the boys after the spell of the trenches.
