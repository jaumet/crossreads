<p>24/9/15  A dreadful sleepless night driven nearly mad by vermin. One mass of flea bites from head to foot and the irritation of lice in head and at the axillae almost unbearable. Not an inch from tip to toe that is not lousy. Later &ndash; On conducting search find black &amp; grey varieties christened Black Watch &amp; Scots Greys. Their parade ground my chest but they bivouac in the lowlands. Sent Mitchell for a supply of verma jelly from Q.M. &ndash; A lovely day but cold still. Censoring letters &ndash; one gentleman makes rather novel proposal to his wife regarding "carrying on" during his absence. The hills here are all covered in one shade of green undergrowth but of 3 different varieties in main. No where do these shrubs grow higher than about 5 feet. Between Indian Camp and Suvla Hills some trees are scattered about on the plains but here there are none. The shrubs are a kind of holly, the rhododendron and <strike>draw</strike> dwarf oak trees about 2 feet high. Wild olives are also to be seen &ndash; In the gullies they say a species of blackberry grows. Birds are scarce but robins and linnets and an occasional thrush come and sit on the trench parapet. Most animal life though shuns this place as accursed the only living things that seem to flourish being the flies and they are in their millions. At night hanging up a coat on the pegs at the top of the dugout causes a hum and stir like a beehive.</p>
<p>Very quiet all day until about</p>
