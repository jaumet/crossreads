 Dear Mum, 
 I am writing just a few lines but the chances are I will be home as soon as this myself.  I hope to be on the water by the end of the month, the name of the boat I am coming on I have forgotten but that doesn't matter as I will soon let you know when I do arrive.  I have just had three days leave in London to visit Bert's wedding which came off very successfully.
