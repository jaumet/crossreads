C/o D.M.S.CairoEgypt24 May 1915
Dear Girls:/
This morning letters were posted to you at the G.P.O. Cairo.   Also to Mollie, Mr. Travers and several others.   To you also were consigned photographs, which mayhap will give you pleasure.
At 6 p.m. on returning from a business jaunt to Cairo I found a cable from you awaiting me:-  "Col. Nash.  Hospital.  Cairo. Via Eastern E.F.M. Sydney - 21-5 (Date) 2-55 p.m.   Many returns nineteenth all well.  Nash."   The implication to me is that you dispatched the message on the 21st of May. and that  It reached me on the 24th.  Whence the delay as the Sydney date indicates that it was not handed in as a week-end message.  I shall ask at Mena tomorrow. Thinking that you would address to Mena, I wrote to the telegraph operator there asking that he should repeat to Abbassia.
Much pleased to learn that you are "All well." Hurrah! Hurrah!!! Hurrah!!!!!. May you all ever be so.
A letter to Mother M. Bertrand has just been finished, which maybe will amuse her to read.   Many subjects are treated of briefly on its sheets.   Enclosed in them is a post card, the Holy Family in the recess above the altar at Matarieh.  I must pay the shrine a visit within the course of a few days.
