  
 May 1917 very little opposition was encountered & several miles of line, Railway platforms & Reservoirs were destroyed.  We left to come back at 3.30 & got back to camp at 11 pm after a tiresome ride of about 18 miles most of it in the dark.  Sgt Sullivan went to hospital 
 Thursday 24th An enemy plane came over & dropped several bombs.  8 or 9 men were wounded & some horses killed.  An Australian mail came in  I got 3 letters, 2 from home & 1 from Roy. 
 Friday 25th More bombs were dropped this morning.  The camel corps got them.  Several camels were killed don't know if any men got hit.  Got in a good supply of canteen stuff & divided it amongst the troop.  The YMCA now supply the Regts in bulk & the QMs divide it out.  It is a good way of keeping up extras to the troops.  Some light clothes I sent to Alex for arrived to day & it was a welcome change to get the heavy old "chatty" togs off. 
 Saturday 26th Some more reinforcements arrived.  I got 3 in "B" troop & am up to full strength again.  There is a certainty of us moving back for a spell in a day or two.  Only hope they give us leave as most
