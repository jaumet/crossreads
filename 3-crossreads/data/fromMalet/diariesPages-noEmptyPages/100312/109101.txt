to hotel via the dark Champs Elysees and then per metro. To Bould. des Italiens for an outdoor dinner consisting of a lemon squash by way of reaction from Henri. 
Returned for a rendezvous but waiting miserably cold a long time. Cleared out at 10.30 getting a note from Rodda just on the death knock. By taxi to Gare du Nord and secured a seat in the Calais train by the kind offices of a busy cold footed redcap alert for a tip. Five days at hotel with breakfast 80 fr. Tips 18.

Travelled all night and all day in various trains bored to extinction and at dusk landed back at Steenvoorde. Walked out to billets and found all well. 25 MM.s out of last stunt. The band played at dinner and it was good to see all the cheerful faces of the boys round the table ? good chaps all of them. Busy writing all the evening. Leave for Rome is through.
