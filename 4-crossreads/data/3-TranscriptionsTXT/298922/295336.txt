Rafa.
My mate Major Irwin is shot through the arm - this time I escaped. Without doubt the ANZAC Mtd. Division are a fine lot of men - we bivouaced last night at Sheik Zowabin for 3 hours to rest & then got back to El Risa with PRISONERS. I & Major O'B & another had a bottle FIZZ on our return presented (& kept for the occasion) by our Merchant in Port Said. After tendering Returns to B.H.Q. I shall sleep tonight.
My cob did well on Bedouin wheat, but had no drink for 36 hours!!!  Among Turkswe got several German Staff Officers but missed General VON -  I took a Belt off a Turk & will get the BUCKLE silver plated for Dolly. All ranks feel well pleased with their work & themselves altho' we've lost a few good men.
