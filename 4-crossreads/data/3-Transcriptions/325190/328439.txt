<p>The gas school was on the northern ridge overlooking<strike>Harfleur</strike> Ruelles.  Directly one has passed through<strike>Harfleur</strike> Ruelles &amp; turned to the left down the valley, the scenery is entirely different.  Instead of dingy marshy &amp; muddy flats, there are verdant hills covered with beautiful trees in autumn foliage.<br/>Everything here is green &amp; fresh &amp; the road good.  We left the road about a mile along &amp; turned to the left, for the camp is on the left ridge of the valley, but we can see the main road go straight along following a course half way up the opposite ridge, past chateaux &amp; beautifully neat country houses of a good size</p>
