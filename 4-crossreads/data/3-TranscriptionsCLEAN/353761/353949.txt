The large tents and the small tents are but outlines. There is peace and silence and slumber here. The burden of our equipment and packs has now become two fold in weight and we are wet though with sweat. The troops mutter and curse, sing and laugh and joke, grumble, whistle and endure; while they all hope for a spell and a rest.
