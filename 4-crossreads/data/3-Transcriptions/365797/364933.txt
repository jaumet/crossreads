<p>I am an engaged lady I have to be more sedate. Dene is so particular you know, &amp; I have to do my best to live up to his ideals, 'tho' the poor chap sometimes has about ninety fits at the things I do. Never mind doubtless I shall be trained &amp; turn out quite a respectable young woman.</p>
<p>I do admire that moustache most awfully of yours, but am not quite sure whether I prefer you without one or not. You know on principle I do not approve of them, but of course with a soldier these things are different. I shall have to wait &amp; see you before I decide I suppose.</p>
<p>Last night we visited Mr. &amp; Mrs. Thompson &amp; she showed me your last post-card &amp; also a very charming photograph of you when you were quite a little boy &ndash; of course ages ago.</p>
<p>Billy is growing into such a big boy &amp; remembers everything. He still does a great deal of visiting in Lindfield</p>
