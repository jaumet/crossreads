<p>Tuesday Nov 3 &ndash; 14  Cup day in Melbourne  -  We got up a sweep - 2/6 tickets &ndash; 40 in it  -  I've got a horse - Hushmoney an outsider  -  &ndash; but still a horse  -  The S.S.  Moresby went out last eveg  for Sydney &amp; carries a letter to you  -<br/>I was on the beach on Monday aftn &amp; spent some time in the Carnegie library looking up the flora of this part  -  I wanted badly the name of a very   fine, very common, tree with a trunk &amp; fluted like a Greek column &amp; with a most [indecipherable] head &amp; branches &amp; often with ferns &amp; mistletoe covering it  -  No doctor man knows anything here but his job just like the N.O.  &ndash; that is perhaps I shd  say in natural science  -  However I got the name it is the Polynesian or Tahiti chestnut &ndash; (Inocarpus edulis)  -  At once I found out all about the tree  -  You see them round the huts of the natives in low lying ground  -  What grand shade trees they are  -<br/>Ferns in this island are everywhere  -  Fancy a total of 246 species of Ferns, Lycapods &amp; Selaginellas</p>
