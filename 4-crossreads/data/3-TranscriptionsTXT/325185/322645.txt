 But that is nothing unusual for this run. This is the third Sunday we have been out haven't had any church parades yet. We have had to get ready each Sunday but something has turned up each time to put it off. Bad weather at first &amp; today it has been raining too much. All on board seem in good cheer. I haven't heard any one complaining about the length of the voyage. Of coarse we are having a very good time. Concerts very often &amp; boxing take up the evenings. I seem out of place on board not having anything to do. I haven't seen anything of N Tait since the 2nd day out I think he must be in the hospital. I didn't take any notice at first as there were not many that were not sea sick. The morning I saw him he was looking very off colour. Well there isent anything to write about so will have to close. Love &amp; best wishes to all at Marshall st your sincere son  Clyde
