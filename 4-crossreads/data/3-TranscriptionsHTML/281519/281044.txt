<p>Ribemont  <br/>23/1/17 Morning parade devoted to still more brushing up and cleaning and a little drill. A bright day but the sun had no power and ground remained hard frozen and returned the show of a week ago. Formed up as a Battalion at 11.30 and did some ceremonial drill. After lunch moved out to parade ground on hillside and formed up in mass with transport in rear for inspection by General Smyth V.C. It was piercingly cold on the frozen and snow covered ground in spite of a futile sun's feeble rays. Received him with the General Salute and Present and accompanied him round the ranks. The wind cut through one and little time was wasted on details but he soon skipped from one to another. Formed then a hollow square and the General made a most kind and complimentary speech. Took the salute on the road and the men marched well to the band. The little village looked pretty nestling in the hollow its white surrounding slopes forming a background. Very cold indoors and Madam wanted to give me a brick. Proudfoot to be our Pay Sergt came in for a yarn</p>
