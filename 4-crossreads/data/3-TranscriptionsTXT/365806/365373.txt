 Since the Battalion has been on service all the officers and Non.Cos. of the Battalion which originally left Sydney have been promoted for their services and it is thought that the Committee would be pleased to hear that the 20th have supplied the following:-  Brigadier of 5th Brigade Col.

 In conclusion the Committee is assured of the appreciation of all ranks for their hard work and kindly interest in the welfare of the Battalion.
