25th Well this morning we had the new at work, dummy firing for a start then in the afternoon we fired them alive, they turned out fairly well they had a fine range 240 yards with a 7sec's fuze, you have to watch yourself for the shock of discharge is considerable they kick some dig a fair hole in the ground, they burst fairly well, after this we all threw of the new type of Egg bomb, these have a percussion lighter you have to knock them
