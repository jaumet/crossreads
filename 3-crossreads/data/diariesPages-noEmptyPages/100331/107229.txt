On arrival at the Soldiers Theatre at 5 Pm we found a large crowd of Boys standing two deep waiting to go in so we formed into line took our Turn, after waiting for about 15" we Doors were opened we went in by our Turn, there were 4 Belgian Girls also waiting to go in so they we told them to get in front of us which they did as the 50 Cent Seats were all sold we only could get 30" which was at the back, anyhow we obtained a good seat behind the Girls had some fun during the evening, The Girls were dressed very plain even had their Aprons on I am satisfied our Australian Girls would never go to a show dressed like that, but it seems to be the custom They don't mind. The Division put on a first class show the crowded house gave them a great reception, it was over at 8 Pm starting at 6 Pm afterwards we made for home had Supper went to bed.
