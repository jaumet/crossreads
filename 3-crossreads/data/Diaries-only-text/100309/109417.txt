25/6/17 Beaulencourt
Up at 6 and left early with the Company Commanders to reconnoitre the ground for our mornings work. Stewart met us at 8 with the Battalion in artillery formations and we massed in a convenient sunken road. At 9.30 jumped off and took two trucks and then worked the loss of a copse and its recapture by means of a counter attack delivered by our supports. Had a pow-wow with the officers and then sent the Battalion in which we reconnoitre the ground for tomorrow. They returned in artillery formation but formed up on the hillside and marched in to the strains of the band which is coming on. Two new bandsmen M.DC Ross were among a draft that marched in last night. Alderson drew up the operation order for the attack tomorrow and after tea all the officers and N.C.O.s went out over the ground. Returning a heavy shower came on and a run to the Q.M.'s store did not avoid a wetting. Just becoming dark at 10 pm.
