<p>Thursday 13 January 1916<br/>Regiment on Parade under Col. Fuller.  Major Sommerville visiting Camp.  He is connected now with Infantry Divisional H.Q. &amp;amp; will go to France with them.<br/>A Trorpy of the 7th whilst returning from Cairo fell off train &amp;amp; was killed.  It was a sorry day for the Regiment when Cap. &ndash; now Major Sommerville left to take up a position on the Permanent Staff.  He is a man with a trained mind combined with Tact and commonsense.  He could be friendly &amp;amp; a true comrade, &amp;amp; at the same time firmly check insubordination &amp;amp; laxity of discipline in a thorough manner.</p>
<p>Friday 14 January 1916<br/>Mounted parade &ndash; Col. Cox commanding the 1st L.H. Brigade.  They leave today for Western front.  Col. Fuller in Cairo tonight.  I don't know that the Higher position now held by our old Colonel will prove satisfactory as far as Peace of mind &amp;amp; smooth sailing is concerned.  It is commonly reported that some of his Officers are not too well pleased with his promotion &amp;amp; there is likely to be friction &amp;amp; stormy times ahead.</p>

<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]<br/>Mounted parade, Col. Cox Brigadier of the 1st L.H. Brigade.  They leave today for Western Front.  Col. Fuller in Cairo tonight.</p>
<p>Cleaning up Camp.  Went into Cairo for Primus Stove &amp;amp; outfit for Officers Mess.<br/>Preparations to leave soon for Canal.<br/>Day by day we become more keenly conscious of the fact that a big move is too take place as far as we are concerned.  When we see our Quarter Master with a large Fatigue party surrounded by heaps of new equipment strewn upon the ground, sorting &amp;amp; counting &amp;amp; distributing the various articles rapidly to the different units we see before us a move of no mean importance.<br/>Also persistant rumours are flying about <u>'Latrines'</u> as we commonly call them, coming from no particular source, but neverless fitting in wonderfully with what is actually known &ndash; we draw conclusions which may mean a different &amp;amp; a more exieting Life than we have here at Maadi.</p>
