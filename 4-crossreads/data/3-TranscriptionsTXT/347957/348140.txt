 This little book is not written, or summarized from various reports published at different times of treatment of our boys in Hunland , but is what actually befell me during my few years as a soldier of the A.I.F. 
 In the early months of 1915 I &amp; two of my brothers, who were both killed  the same day I was taken prisoner, one older &amp; the other younger than myself, enlisted for service abroad &amp; after several months of training    &amp; camp life, ultimately found ourselves all in the same company of the 32nd Batt. 
 My training &amp; voyage across to Egypt was identicle with that of our bonny boys who went to that dirty, flea, lice &amp; fly infested country so will skip over it, commencing my varied experiences from the time we left the Arabian desert for quiet picturesque France &amp; the awful Huns that were doing their utmost to overrun France &amp; outrage all humanity in the worst possible ways.
