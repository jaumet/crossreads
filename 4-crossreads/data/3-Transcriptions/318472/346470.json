<p>2 September 1918<br/>Monday<br/>The wind has no way abated &amp; the sea is fairly rough with a heavy sea. About 8 P.M. there was a fairly heavy thunderstorm but we appear to have missed the worst of it. No war news.</p>
<p>1918 September 3<br/>Tuesday<br/>A nice sunny day with a fair wind &amp; swell. Still steering about 10 kts. &amp; everything going well. Everybody appears to be getting tired of the journey and all will be glad when it is finished.</p>
