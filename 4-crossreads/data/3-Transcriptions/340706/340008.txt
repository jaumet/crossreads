<p>54<br/>it. However on seeing Redfern I find CO has cancelled order &amp; said that I was not available so thus far I do not know whether I am going or not at present. Snow is still falling</p>
<p>Tonight received word from de Vere that order was temporarily suspended &amp; that I was to go to Brigade with Thomas as Brigade Claims Officer but that in meantime I stand by. After this I attended a lecture on New Guinea &amp; heard that it rains 269 day in year &amp; averages 1 in per day &ndash; that place is full of malaria, crocodiles alligators &amp; cannibals &ndash; that natives save 3 tribes are treacherous. Just a nice place to avoid I should think</p>
<p>6-2-19 Thurs<br/>No news through to day re transfer &ndash; so am sitting still &ndash; refusing to attend parades or do anything for the company Redfern &amp; [Fry] have received sudden orders to sail for Australia to day</p>
<p>Have seen the post red robin today Generally there are plenty of chaffinch but no robins. Just now the accumulated snow on the roof became dislodged &amp; tons of snow fell on to ground, Pity help anyone caught below they would have a rather rough time of it Went for a walk after dinner</p>
