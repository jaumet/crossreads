<p>troops advancing on Katia.<br/>At 1.30 we had Katia surrounded at 2.30 a general attack was made  &amp;  kept up until dark but we had, I think bitten off a bit more than we could chew  &amp;  at 7.30 out crowd came home followed by the regiments.<br/>I believe today our infantry is out there attacking it, but I don't know how they are getting on.
