 began a fight for masteri . One could see the flame come from their machin gun , against the dark background . After about half an hour good go one of our plane score a direct hit and the last I saw was the German fall through the air in a slant posit toward their line . 10 of our fellow retun from Poizer Contalmasison and Albert today where they have been attach for some time . They have all had lucki escap . Lose onli 3 hors on the trip . They brought back mani souvenir with them The German are again put shell into Albert and Bosancourt and just as I write our 15 inch Sleep Lizzi is answer them . This gun is fire from a special built Railway track , and to take the tremend recoil , the Engine is set go in the opposit direct at full speed and onli just succeed in stop it . The 1st Divis infantri march in this morn togeth with all column , after have had a fair spell . Gener Birdwood has told us that there is go to be no spell for the Australian until the war is over so fini . One of our chap was sever kick by a hors this morn , and is veri bad as a result of same . Blousin is in England . 17.8.16 Thursday The main item of import in today cours was the great activ of Aeroplan . One flight of 30 machin was make for the German Line earli this morn I feel sorri for the peopl they drop their bomb on . 3 Taub were set upon by some of out Battl Plane after a veri fierc fight which last for about half an hour one of them burst into flame fell headlong to the ground , this satisfi the remain two they flew off to their own side , close pursu by our machin . The 4th Divis have now move to the rear , but the Lahor Artilleri ourselv have to remain in this local for about 6 week , hard luck for us . I have just receiv a further batch of letter from you all and left off write this afo to read them . Aeroplan are return home from their raid and the air hum with their noisi propellor . We all just wit a further combat between a British and German Aeroplan and the German was again brought down in flame . Our huge battl plane are death on the German Taub and it make us all feel a wee bit safer with our huge wagon park . We have all been told that within 2 or 3 week the huge and dinkum offens is to start right throughout the whole front if this transpir I realli think that it will be the begin of the end . We have again pick up the Railhead job and everi morn the Waggon have to go out to Acheux to pick up the load , .return to Sen to re-issu to unit and then take it out through Albert and Bosancourt to the fire line . Mani horribl sight are to be seen through Albert , and where the old trench use to run . Whenev our artilleri sink a gun pit it is a certainti that they will strike human remain as I think men are buri over everi part of Franc . Then again when the German send their jackjohnson or coalbox over they general blow an immens crater in the ground and blow rotten part of decompos bodi all over the place . The place fair stink and one is alway pleas to get back away from it for a spell In dig dug-out , men sometim strike the limb of bodi , and it is a common sight to see an arm or a leg protrud out of the wall , both German and English . As state abov it is most like that we are here for anoth 6 week , and if so it will come my turn for the tramway job which is veri danger , on account of be under shell fire the whole time , but one can onli live and hope . 18.8.16 Friday . It rain again today and made the road except hard for our work , which take us over veri difficult countri . One of our hors drop dead at Acheux and we had to put a ride hors in it place to draw the vehicl , afterward send a parti back to buri him . There is a heavi bombard proceed on our left sector in the region of Thiepval This place is a thorn in the side of the advanc and is hold it up , and same be a wonder strong fortifi posit is go to caus some troubl . Our sleep Lizzi has again been sever strafe the German again and of cours we have been get a few return . The Aeroplan are again veri activ and this coupl with the Bombard which has just start is probabl the start of a renew attack . I understand that they have driven an immens mine lead right under Thiepval and we all expect it to go up in the air in a few day time . Cavalri is again activ and if they can onli break through there will be some fun on the Somm front 19.8.16 Saturday Last night was anoth Hell of a night and the Artilleri Salvoeff from the 750 gun on our sector was terribl to listen to . The struggl has again open up with redoubl furi and our object this time is the famous fortress of Thiepval : whether it fall or not is an entir differ question , but if we can onli take it , the termin point of the whole German posit will have been reach and the German will find themselv compel to retreat . As is onli natur the struggl is of a terribl natur and each step gain is paid for in blood . But the latest news avail is to the effect that the German are be slowli push backward . Evidenc of the heroic natur of the struggl in progress is evinc from the fact that a column of 1500 un-wound prison march through today . They were all sort and size and each one seem to be mighti pleas that they were captur . On our right the French are do well and by a concert action with our extrem right flank carri the key posit to the Town of Maurepa and Baupum , It is at the last name place that the German have their big gun mount and the loss of it to them will be serious . They realis the fact that they are be forc out of their impregn posit and consequ fight like corner tiger . The French bombard is veri live and we are all expect news of the fall of Peronn , which is their object . The Black Watch have again distinguish themselv and to them lie the honour of the major of prison captur today also to a veri substanti advanc . We are have a particular rough time of it now . Reveill be at 3 am and never get to bed befor 10 pm . We all got flood out today on account of an except heavi downpour of rain but it is a case of grin and bear it . Later There are persist rumour that Thiepval has fallen to us , but none of us believ it as yet , becaus on account of it be the key posit of the Somm offens we are all expect a hard struggl for it , Howev everybodi is anxious regard the place and it will be a big relief to everyon when the posit is won . I close observ some fresh arriv prison today in Sen and realli I cannot say much for there look and physiqu and firm believ that if they were not back by such a huge quantiti of artilleri , that our fellow would walk through and through them . 20.8.16 Sunday The bombard never ceas all last night and in the earli hour of the morn after a tremend gradual eas off in it intens . New is veri scarc but one good item has come to hand 3 British Divis advanc on out left flank and surpris the German took 3 line of trench and 400 Prison . A great number of offic were includ in the number and it appear that they had all been summon to a confer at a given point and our forc attack in strength and with great rapid took the lot . There were no more surpris Gentlemen in the wide world than when they found themselv look down the wrong side of Bayonetss held in the hand of the famous Black Watch regiment . They were all brought into Achusen and will be taken to Harv enrout for England . The Field Engineer depot situat alongsid our bivouac , present a veri busylik appear tonight as string and string of Motor Lorri with Pontoon attach are come in . This to us look like the anticip cross of the Somm River . We saw 7 of our Aeroplan bring down a German observ Balloon this Evene and as it was fall it burst into flame . It is not veri often that one can see a German Balloon up now befor our plane effect deal with it , but at the same time it presenc is alway felt , as par exampl of this Evene for although it was onli up for a few minut , it suffic to give them the rang and at the present time we are be shell by their big howitz from Baupaum . The whole sky is black with the shrapnel burst and the sooner it give over the better I will like it . The day has been fright cold with a nasti bleak wind blow and I do not know how on earth I am go to get on tonight if it doe not get a littl warmer . The Reveill racket of 3 am is no bon and we are all begin to feel rather fatigu . 21.8.16 Monday Today has been a terror , in that all the dissatisfact of sever past week came to ahead and all the NCOs were held account for same . I and sever more offer to revert but no notic has been taken of it . The new phrase of the offens on the Somm still continu and the fight is terrif . Thiepval has not yet fallen , but it is onli a question of day now , as our troop have taken domin posit on either side of the Villag . Its defenc are the most marvel in the world and no frontal attack could ever possibl succeed in take it . . Huge Cupola built of steel and man by heavi gun command all approach , but these are gradual becom smash and I suppos when the time is ripe a fierc hand to hand fight will place it in our possess . Numer air duel are occur hour and one Taub unfortun manag to drop a few bomb in Sausag Gulli caus lot of damag and loss of life . We are gong to be move North again after this final flutter and as far as is known are go to Ypres , to reliev the Canadian who will come down and take their turn on the Somm Front , but from all account we are go to a pretti hot shop , situat somewher near Popperingh . 22.8.16 Tuesday . This afternoon and practic the whole of the night has been by far the worst time I have yet experienc , and I will alway rememb it . Previous to the start of it Some Fokker and Taub got over our line and did some observ which unfortun for us all was correct . Whilst we were sit down to tea , we were all startl by the familiar hiss of a big shell and heard it come straight for us . You bet we all duck . It struck earth about 150 yard from us and caus a deafen roar send dirt etc fli in all direct . A few of us went up onto a high ridg of land about 100 yard from us and sat down to watch the firework and I can assur you they kept it go . Shell after shell came hurtl over and it was almost terrifi to see them gradual creep up toward our line . I saw sever larg one burst close by to us and it is truli an aw sight . One shell we watch go right plunk on top of a small bivouac and the remain of 2 men who were sleep insid were never found . Of cours it goe without say that dure a long rang bombard of this kind , sever loss of life is alway in it wake , as they rare wast such valuabl ammunit unless sure of profit result . Right up to about midnight this shell continu , sleep of cours be imposs . They seem to be fall all round us and yet by good luck none actual got us , but at the same time I think that they are leav us too long in the same posit . To resum the stori of the night experi . Our Gun hitherto silent took up the challeng and then the row and racket began . On one side of us were 5.9 , 8" and the other the big naval 15 " gun . All night long they blaze away and my insid just feel as though it is turn insid out . They grew quiet this morn at 6 am but the smaller field piec are fire furious . 23.8.16 Wednesday . Follow on the big bombard we have advanc at sever point , and now hold 3 cardin point which domin the fortress of Thiepval and we are watch this struggl with interest . Our big gun are now train on it but on account of the marvel depth of the dug-out some of which are 80 to 90 feet deep the artilleri are unabl to do much more than blow the topmost posit to piec , which is be done . Huge 9 inch and 12 to 15 inch shell are caus the natur format of the land to chang . The struggl is a desper one , as both side are do their utmost . The British are advanc step by step on either side of it , after have the way care and systemat search with Artilleri fire , whilst the German continu feed their defenc with their best and freshest of troop . Accord to Prison captur in the immedi vicin , it is a Prussian Guard Divis that is now hold it . On other sector of the Front , good work is be accomplish and despit the fact that the German are still as strong on Artilleri strength as ever , they are be slowli forc backward , and must begin to realiz by now that they are be slowli strangl . The weather is again wet and the road are veri slipperi . Consequ our transport duti are much harder . 24.8.16 Thursday The Bombard eas off this morn but open up again this afternoon and at the time of write are hammer away at a great rate . The chief item of today do is the great activ of the Aeroplan . There seem to be hundr of machin out and the sky is litter with puff shot of the gun , whilst the spent shell rattl all over the place . Mani duel occur abov our line , but I did not see ani brought down . The fight is report to be particular sever near Guillamont which is anoth posit of strateg valu on the Somm Front . Our boy who were work from Albert up to Contalmaison , Beecourt Wood , Ovillier Flucourt and Delvill Wood with Ammunit load have been present with illumin address by Gener Cox their name are Whelan , Hansen and Coolata , E the last 2 name are both old 20th ASC lad , who came away from Sydney in our old Compani . Persist rumour are fli round that the German are prepar to retreat , but this is better believ when it is an accomplish fact , All the same the rang of our gun have had to be alter to reach their posit and in some case the big gun have move up . We are under order to leav here for the North again so as to rest after our 1 month solid go , We entrain in a few day time , the 1st Divis have alreadi move out . I hear we are go back to Ypres again , so I fail to see where the rest come in , as this place [Ypres ] is a 3 side Salient and we catch it from 3 side , Howev they know what they are do . A few more indign have been place upon our head by the O in that they have order a big batch of Comfort to be place in their bivouac and what is left the men will get I suppos . The men bivouac have also been order to be pull down as they look unsight , this mean they must camp in the open . What matter - They have billet , We are all full up and onli await our chanc of retribut on return to Australia then it will be our chanc . 25-8.-16 Friday And 26 -8-16 Apart from the usual fierc bombard and fight noth of unusu import has occur . Our forc have advanc a further 300 yard on a 1000 yard front near Thiepval also at Guillemont . The weather has again turn out wet and it has not ceas for 2 day . A veri cold wind is blow which is a foretast of approach winter . Our 1st Division Infantri has again move up from St Ledger and goe into the front line tonight . The tramway job in Albert re-comm and I am get a parti of them away tonight . We are all intens interest at the cours of event in Greec and are wonder what it will final lead to . A big batch of comfort has arriv and I am just go to have a tin of preserv peach and cream . Hear me smile . 27.8.16 Sunday Today has again been wet and slipperi with a bitter cold rain and blow which chill one through and through . I had to take a larg convoy of waggon with suppli right up , and although under heavi shell fire it was veri interest . I will tri to give my actual impress . I left Sen at 1 pm and take the main road went through Bouzencourt which place is practic demolish . On the outskirt of this villag you pass the chalkfield and it is a perfect demon of a job to get load waggon along as the hors cannot get a grip , and consequ down they go . About 1 mile further on you strike the old 1st line of trench and I can assur you that they have a sinist appear , I suppos thousand of men are buri in the hastili dug pit all along the edg of the trench and the weed which are now grow there coupl with the barb wire entangl , and with the crude littl board which just simpli read ( " Here lie ? men ? compani ) give the place a ghast appear . The line of trench can be trace with the nake eye for mile and for mile and everi yard claim it victim . It has a great snake like appear to view it wind over hill and dale as it doe . All along the road , in the gulli and field are cun design gun pit , some of which were built by the German in their retreat , Four mile further on the onc beauti town of Albert is situat and I must write someth of the devast which has befallen this citi . By reput it is term the second citi of the Somm and it has mani beauti build in it which are all most heap of ruin . The Cathedr and it monument I have alreadi written about previous but sinc then some more big shell have struck it and it is in a veri shaki condit . A larg Motor Car ( Brasseri ) and machin factori close by is just simpli one mass of twist steel . This build was built of steel girder and the way they have been twist up is someth marvel . Imagin a place like say Parramatta onli with more up to date build and especi the beauti Cathedr . Fanci to yourself that it was smash to piec and what was not smash was burnt and you can form some idea of the damag wrought . On pass through I had to move the column quick as the German were busi shell the place and big high explos shell were send brick and stone fli in everi direct . Further out one come to Contalmaison , Ovillier and Poizer and I absolut defi anyon to see anyth that would lead one to believ that there had been habit there . Of cours our own gun did this and it is probabl that all villag wherein the German offer resist will be similar treat . Delvill Wood which was so hard to take was on my right as I move along and it was be veri heavili shell by the German , the place La Boisell is wipe off the face of the countri . The British mine this and when I tell that 1000 ton of explos were use in the one charg it will give you an idea of the magnitud of same . It was a particular heavi defend posit on account of the posit of the land and warrant the cost . To look at the place now it has the appear of a huge Brickfield Pit , The dimens of the crater are Breadth mile length mile , depth 1 to 30 ft deep . The German had fright loss here on this occas and assert that they have never experienc the like of it in their life , neither have I . The stench of decompos bodi is veri distress hereabout and it is noth to see human remain blown about by explod shell . Our artilleri when dig gunpit , often come across pit of men and have to fill it in and dig elsewher . I arriv back safe , howev , I cannot honest say that I want to go out again , but if I have to go well never mind . 28.8.16 Monday Our HeadQuart have again move up to the front and I believ it is to be our final splash here for a while . The German are again whip some HE in and by the sound of same they are some close , although there are a lot of dud . Aeroplan are again veri activ so I suppos it mean anoth bombard tonight .It has rain hard again today and also been cold . No news to hand but rather fanci that there is not so veri much do , at the present time , Possibl wait for some divers in the Thiepval Region . 29.8.16 After a furious 3 hour bombard by our big gun , all field piec have been move forward 2000 yard . This mean to us that a further concentr of Artilleri fire is about to be brought on the new German posit in front of us but I doubt whether our Armi will particip this time . The French have been bombard on our right and it seem as though they are prepar the way for a further advanc , as there Artilleri fire is terrif We have receiv unoffici news to the effect that Roumania has declar war against Austria and everyon is jubil over same as if it is true it mean the begin of the end of this great struggl , How ever they are go to fix thing up after the struggl , lick me . I saw one of our Aeroplan brought down just now . He was up a good height and a shell got him . The machin just seem to rock for a second and then tilt nose down ward and start to come down at a startl pace . The Aviator made desper struggl to right it and succeed in steadi himself when about 300 yard from the ground , he dive from that height howev and struck . Another plane follow him down but whether he rescu the pilot or not , I am unabl to say . They are explod smoke bomb alongsid our line and the wind be favour , drift it along and entir envelop our big gun posit thus hide the tell tale flash from the muzzl . There is evid someth big do today as all along the front the big gun and small one are send shell scream in everi direct . The German are by no mean idl either , and shell are fall into Albert Bouzincourt , Millencout and the outskirt of Sen everi hour . Another parti of our men have been sent out to Becourt Wood to work with the Royal Engineer , this is a heavili shell area , and they may strike troubl . A batch of 32 German Prison belong to the new draft of the Prussian Guard were sent back to Warloy today , and from their look do not compar favour with the Prussian Guard we read about earli in the war . It rain again earli this morn but has sinc clear up , although the sky still look overcast and raini . Later A terrif bombard has start all along the front and the nois is terribl to have to endur . The shell go whistl along with an uncanni and sinist sound to strike the earth and explod with a nois like thunder . At the present moment a terribl thunder storm has just eas off and while it last I assur you that it was not pleasant . The artilleri fire never abat , and it coupl with the exceed heavi thunder clap made one think of home and mother . The rain pelt down in torrent and veri soon the creek and gulli were all run banker . It was an awe-inspir view to wit the vivid lighten flash plain silout against the devast ruin of Albert . It is now offici that Roumania has thrown in her weight with the Alli and the million fresh bayonet that will be fight will shorten the war consider . Anyway we are all anxious await news of her first blow which will make themselv felt . 30.8.16 Wednesday Today is realli the worst day on record and to cap all I have veri sever pain in my tummi , which give me gip . It is absolut imposs to keep dri and warm . The wind goe right through us and the rain beat into everi corner . This is one of the mani hardship which we have to contend with and I honest admit that it is fair break my heart . God , what a countri , Egypt was hot without ani rain but this dam place has never been dri sinc we arriv here , and cold well I do n't think I will ever get warm again . Wet blanket to sleep in ? consequ I am in a mad rage . There is a veri fierc battl go on which doe not improv matter by ani mean and the German are tear the shell in like furi . Of cours they are not have it their own way by ani mean . The Bavarian are attack the Australian 4th Divis and so far they have not done much more than get themselv slaughter . There is an unoffici rumour of anoth naval battl also German declar on Roumania . 31.8.16 Thursday The night remain bitter cold and it was imposs to keep warm . The weather broke this morn howev , the sun is tri to peep through the storm cloud . Last night bombard was the hottest I have ever heard the way the big gun fire was absolut marvel . There was not one second intermiss between the various salvo of fire . The caus of it was the desper effort the Bavarian Guard were make to break our line , but although they tri all night long , the 12th 13th Brigad repuls them each time . It has quieten down this morn , but the Rifl 4.2 18 pounder are still veri busi . The Scottish Regiment are again march in to see them swing along the Albert Road , with desol on either side , the pipe all skirl is a great sight . Part of our divis is entrain for Ypres today I suppos we will follow on later to either Armentier or Popering in Belgium . We are to reliev the Canadian then , so that they can have a go down here , sever Divis of them have alreadi arriv here , A coupl of Ulster Divis are alongsid us , they are all fine chap . There is grow animos between the Tommi Wallabi 1.9.16 Friday I again went out with the convoy today this time go as far as Albert branch out to the right of the Citi . Everyth was in a state of bustl on account of Canadian Armi march in . I thorough inspect the big 15 " Naval Gun which doe the damag I can tell you she is some gun . The road were all choke with Canadian troop , includ mani Scottish Regiment I was pleas to see what a fine stamp of men they were . I receiv 2 letter from Nina , one of which had 2 photo enclos I am veri pleas with same , although it give me a home sick feel when I look at them . It was a surpris to see the great number of observ balloon up today , both British German , This mean an artilleri duel tonight . I was watch the 10 " gun fire through curios got a shock concuss caus through ventur too close to them when fire . No more for Rick I tell you . I also visit the 1st Line Trench from which the German have recent been push out of . And I can tell you it would open anyon eye to see them , mile mile of barb wire entangl , pit entrench wherev you look . It is simpli marvel that our armi have been abl to advanc at all , they have simpli blast them out of it occupi their posit . It gave me a pang when I saw the Canadian Scottish march through Albert with shell tear all round it seem such a shame that such fine men should be sacrif their live in thousand as the grave yard will tell you for the sin and error of Kaiser Bill . Great news is come through from the Balkan but a reserv must be place on a lot of it as some of it is of a startl rumour . None of us quit know how the Roumanian situat will affect this front but our convers alway get heat we knock off . 2.9.16 Saturday Today has held mani surpris in store and I suppos when you get notif of what I am do , it will surpris you , but circumst coupl with overwork strain and worri decid me in take the step , Also a promis of promot in the near futur , I will narrat the convers as it actual occur . " On be told that sever Commiss had becom vacant that sever of us had again been overlook for junior I rais a kick which led to certain interview , the result of which was made appar to me by Major C today , under instruct from someon higher up he state that all transport Com had be fill for some consider time , but admit that I had earn a star for past work also Certif which I hold also state that there would soon be a vacanc in the Suppli Section to this end ask me to revert to the rank of Staff Sgt , which howev is the same rate of pay is realli on the same foot . The idea is that , have the Transport experi by me , I can learn the suppli part thus have both at my finger tip , He state that he knew I had been overwork late this would be a good chanc of a littl rest as there is not as much worri work in the last mention duti . He further state that he could promis me , that it would not be long befor I got my Star that I had the CO Tran influenc behind me . All these fact togeth with the certain knowledg that I need rest has decid the cours of action which I intend to take hope for the result to matur at an earli date . It also mean that I will not be tie to the Camp as former consequ will have better chanc of see the countri without the usual worri of entrain 300 hors wagon etc , which up to the present time has fallen to my lot . I fanci it is for the best as I am break away from all old grove one veri certain thing , I was sure of that was that I suit too well as a CSM would have end my day as same , if I had not of step out . War news is pretti much the same thing with not much do . The aeroplan are veri busi the anti aircraft gun are spit out their shell in hundr . In one corner I can count as mani as 30 plane circl about , from their action it appear as though they are fight hostil machin although it is too far away to discern veri clear . I am heartili sick of the whole affair I can assur you that it would be with a feel of great relief if the war were to sudden end today but no such luck , I suppos that it will continu to drag on right throughout the winter thus ad a few more hardship to a rotten disagre life . When I look at all your photo think of the disgrac manner thing are carri out like here well , it make me bile , I can assur you I do 3.9.16 Sunday At 3 am this morn a furious Artilleri attack commenc has been rage ever sinc . Everyth els compar to this has been child play . The news to hand is that our Infantri attack an import posit held on to it like grim death be oppos by Prussian Guard of which 3 divis have been hurri up to the line . The posit at the present time is both curious critic the Prussian counter attack , but were stop by our fire , whilst their artilleri establish a barrag of fire behind our fellow so that no munit or reinforc could be taken up . Our artilleri did likewis behind them it is now a question of artilleri ordin . Gun are be hurri up on both side it is a prefect inferno what the troop are suffer could never be adequ describ , The Canadian are in close support all offic say that we will be abl to swamp them with the weight of our artilleri . A place that I was visit yesterday was heavili shell today I am veri thank that I was not there today . We are move on the 6th of this month to a place where "gas " is veri preval , so am hope for the best , although none of us like the idea of it at all . Prepar are be made for the winter so am resign myself to it . 4.9.16 Monday We have all had a veri live time today owe to Fritz put over some of his big shell strang to say keep it up . It has occur sever time today at the present moment has been resum . He start by put over a few "whiz-bang " has kept it up with high explos , altern with shrapnel at various period for rang direct purpos . Owing to the humid of the air , the explos could alway be seen befor the familiar hiss in the air reach us . They were shell a high ridg just near us , about 500 yard away can tell you it sent creepi feel down my spine . You would hear a deafen report see the earth spring up into the air for about 30 feet , whilst through the debri one could see piec of iron steel fli in all direct , Lot of soldier were run to each shell burst to obtain souvenir but I let them alon . The shrapnel start next although far more danger , owe to it spread , was not so bad on the nerv . One would hear the far-away explos of the gun ( which we can all swear to now ) a few second later a vivid flash in the air , togeth with a dens volum of smoke a deafen report would signal it messag to us . They seem to be shell the road which all transport take to Albert over the ridg also the observ balloon on the Theipval Sector , which are situat just in front of us . They fail to get the later owe it deflat and be taken away in good time but they made a rotten mess of the road . Howev as thousand of men are kept busi on the road not much inconveni result . Our repli will no doubt be given tonight as 4 larg Naval long gun have just gone through the villag . Our troop have taken Monquet Farm firm held it final hand over to the Canadian who are reliev us . No more mention has been made of my transfer as yet but I expect it later . 5.9.16 Tuesday The weather has again been fright cold for the last 2 day tonight it is the dizzi limit . I am write this under adverc circumst see that I can hard hold the pencil for numb finger ala there are some French Sergeant here sing away in French like fun , to one that doe not understand the languag it is extrem pain as I explain to Monsieur Rouvet , who hail from Calai To say that he was amaz would be to put it mild . The furious fight still continu the German are still put shell over at us . Sever of us had lucki escap today . The DAC wagon had a shell explod besid 2 of them piec of jag shell actual shot away piec of the seat the driver escap to say that we went like blaze would express it veri mild . The driver put their whip over the hors tore along although there was practic no need , as the nois of the explos was suffici . One shell hit a Cape Cart blew it , driver hors to smithereen whilst a small Fox terrier which was actual within 2 or 3 feet of the burst was unscath , but you should have seen him go . The British French have again advanc have taken part of Guichi all Guillemont . These are import villag the way the Prussian Guard are counter-attack speak volum for the import that they attach to it loss . So far howev all their effort have been smash by our Artilleri Fire the posit is like to remain in our hand .

We move back today , pass through Acheux Ourvill sever other place are now bivouack at Orvilleu which is about 2 mile from Doullen . It is great to be away from the front I can tell you I will sleep more peac tonight than I have done for sever week . Later ? I did not have the sleep I intend to have as at the last moment I decid to go into Doullen so hop up onto a motor I got a ride in . After have a look round I decid to return home found that I could not get a convey of ani kind . So subsequ had to foot it , a good 6 metr . It was rotten . Doullen is a Vill of 10000 inhabit veri prettili situat on the bank of the Somm . It has been a town of import year ago has castl with moat round them like olden day . I tell you it is great to get back into civil again .

After get into our compart we had previous had a [indecipher ] of [indecipher ] between ourselv bought champagn , tin fruit , cake etc . I can tell you we had a pretti love trip while it last . We then went to sleep on the floor in the rack anywher we could get was awaken at 6.30 am by the guard who told us we had reach our destin , call code ? Wauveld near the Belgium frontier . Then began the work of disentrain . 9.9.16 Saturday We finish offload had a cup of tea , look in move off for an unknown destin . . After pass through much interest countri we stop at Steenvord for dinner . I rode through this citi was much interest in all I saw . We start off then cross the Franco Belgian Frontier at 2 pm . Just after ride along from the Frontier I ran into Uncle Charli whom I have not seen sinc leav Egypt .

Then began the usual routin of build hors line . Pitch [indecipher ] etc which tire me out . I final went to bed veri tire might say slept well . 10.9.16 Sunday Today has pass without much of ani note occur . We straighten thing out a littl I then had a chanc to look round a littl . We are camp in a littl villag about a mile from Poperingh the same distanc from Ypres . Both these Citi are veri beauti built , although there is not veri much left of Ypres . It is wors than Albert . Part of Poperingh are in ruin , but the main part is still intact . It is curious to watch the habit of the Belgium peopl , their way be far differ to the French , They all seem to wear the clog for foot gear in the countri villag but in the citi they are beauti dress the women folk all seem exceed pretti . They all hail the Australian with delight , have becom tire of the Canadian Imperial on account of them have been here for so long also I suppos the Australian pay . One grave danger of this place is the frequenc of gas attack , everi time the gas alarm sound one has to get up fall in on parad with gas helmet on , place nosebag full of wet hay light over the hors head . All the villag are engag on hop pick of which there is a veri larg amount grown , all age are to be seen in the hop field pick away for their live . We are in rear of Hill 60 made famous about 12 month ago by the furious fight to all account , it will soon be the scene of further strafe . They say it is all under mine expect to be blown up at ani time . Thing in the fight line are dead tame here in comparison to the Somm the compar quiet is a bless as 6 week in Albert was suffici for Richard but I understand we are to go again later on . 11.9.16 Monday noth much to report . The weather is veri cold here total differ to Franc where I have just come from .

I have not yet been under a sever gas attack but it is a moral certainti that it will come our way as soon as the wind chang owe to the British give them a fair liber dose . I went to a veri pretti Belgium Citi this afternoon call Waerslad near the French Border . It is hidden away beneath tall tree in a valley with a big Convent overlook it from the crest of a big hill . One cannot help compar the attitud of the Belgian peopl to those of the French . The populac as a whole , especi the winsom lassi ( who by the way are strike handsom ) cannot do enough for one . I am extrem puzzl over a letter receiv from Nina in which she state that I am in England . I have never been near there as a matter of fact , have come straight to Franc from Egypt last June 12.9.16 Tuesday The old matter of my transfer to the Suppli re-open today and \i glad consent , especi as \i was told that I was certain to get my Star within a month .

My time will come direct to have a look at the old dart I suppos . War news still continu to be of a veri satisfactori natur the French are again do wonder near Peronn . I took a stroll through Steenvoord which is in the natur of a larg French Citi it was veri gay . Everi second place is an estaminet needless to state they are all full of soldier , owe to the 13th Brigad be camp in this vicin . It would do your eye good to see the happi way all these fellow have with them the whole town is simpli one big uproar of various nois .

All the Battalion QMs are veri nice chap and help the work consider . The French have put up a great advanc round Peronn we are all expect to hear of it fall direct , togeth with Baupamm Combl . All these mention place are big Citi Railway centr . Consequ the German are hold on like furi but it is no good . The Alli Artilleri is go to blast the German out of all their so call impregn posit befor veri long . 15.9.16 Friday . The weather seem to have broken it now onli rain off on , but this is quit enough to make thing veri sticki underfoot I jump on a bicycl today cover a good few mile of countri sight-se . A thing that I have not been abl to do for mani a month . I have now cut they job down to 3 hour per day . Good go eh . There is not much to write of here , as we are a good way in rear of the line , whilst our Brigad rest I can tell you it need it . The Brigad went into the Trench when we were at the Somm after take the Train march out 2000 odd strong , not withstand the fact that it had been reinforc onc . 16.9.16 Saturday Another cold day , but I understand that the cold will continu now so we have got to becom use to it . I rode a bicycl a few mile to have a look round got in as far as Meteren Fletr which was our old Billet area . It is desert now as there are no soldier there at all . The 2nd Divis are get readi to go into the trench on the Poperingh Ypres front , so it will be our turn next . I receiv sever letter yesterday note that you still think I am in England . Howev I have sent a letter explain same . Good news still come through from the front . 17.9.16 Sunday Today is a fine one veri pleasant . The suppli work still continu to run on smooth is prove a boon to me , as I now have plenti of time to rest . I never went out today remain in my bivouac most of the time . Great news is to hand from the Somm front , the British have made a further big advanc captur a larg number of prison . You will no doubt have read of the big Armour Motor Tractor be use for the first time . These are gigant thing built on the Caterpillar wheel system abl to safe negoti ani hill as well as take a 12 ft trench safe . They are arm with heavi gun do an immens deal of damag when they get go . There are persist rumour that the German have ask for an armistic if this is so , it certain show a weak . In our opinion it will be imposs for them to hold such a big front dure the winter month everyon is expect to hear of them fall back on a shorter front direct . Of cours it will have to be veri care plan as we have a nice littl packet of 40,000 cavalri wait to get through the minut the last line of trench are reach . The 3rd Divis have not yet declar War , consequ they are still in England , presum have a good time . To say that we are jealous would be to express it mild . The 50th Battalion move from Steenvoord today back to St . Omar , to undergo a school of instruct , so I suppos we will still continu to hang on here for some time . Later . It is snow in England we are get the wind off it , consequ it is dam cold . The weather has again broken it is pour down in torrent .

I am afraid that there will be mani sorri home in far away Australia befor this cruel war has finish , Our camp ground are in a fear mess , up to our knee in mud , but it is the same wherev you go , so it is no use tri to better the condit . I have a veri quaint assembl for the Suppli Section here , one chap is a Ragtim Singer dancer off the Tivoli he is veri amus anoth has spent most of his life in India anoth has been an offic in the RAN , whilst still anoth one held a high posit in the Lunaci Dept , be of a witti natur often keep us in roar . One man come from the Mexican Border is full of devil . This constitut the major of the men a happier littl parti never exist . 19.9.16 Tuesday . 20.09.16 Wednesday Tuesday was on a par with all other day with noth of note occur Wednesday was on the busi side chiefli on account of the long Distanc our Section had to travel to issu to the Brigad which has move up to the Trench . We had to go right into Reninhelst which is a fair big villag on the Yser . After finish up the Sergeant I caught a Motor Car to Poperingh spent the afternoon look round also have a good tea . Poperingh which was batter about dure the Battl of Ypres in Oct. 1914 is a larg Belgian Citi is about the same size as Marseill . The local Resid have all gone , but are gradual drift back again , but the place is fair full of refuge from other part of Belgium , chiefli spi . Its main build are like all French Belgian Citi immens Church Cathedr which have in this case escap destruct . The eastern part of the Citi is in ruin by air all round observ of the shape of the Battl Front which form a big salient it has had a veri lucki escap . We went practic to the outskirt of Ypres , which is about 3 mile further on . This Citi is larger than Poperingh although held by the British is practic raze to the ground . It is usual shell heavili by the enemi everi day . All the peopl about here seem to be either pick hop or make lace give one the impress of be veri industri . I pass the old 14s camp but did not have time to see ani of them . All this district is subject to gas attack but the peopl as well as soldier are use to it taken in time , doe not prove fatal . I final caught a motor to Abeel from there got anoth one over the frontier back to Steenvoord . We leav for Renighelst tomorrow to occupi our winter camp . 21.9.16 Thursday 22.9.16 Friday Both day were occupi in move up to Belgian Front area onc more we are sleep to the accompani of the thunder of big gun . It is not quit so bad as the Somm but there happen to be a heavi batteri close to us when they fire salvo which they do regular right throughout the night it shake our bivi . We are all camp in Hut built close to the ground for warmth it resembl a Rabbit Warren to look at it . We have a larg stove in the centr of our hut it is great to make toast on for warmth . We are live well altogeth I think that we are as comfort as ever we have been .
