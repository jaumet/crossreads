The residents did a great deal for us in getting up sports meetings and entertainments after the day's work & altogether things went very smoothly indeed.

Our horses are all in splendid fettle now and we have some pretty long days in the field, but the climate is very bracing here and makes one feel very fit. The impression one would get from reading of Egypt is that there is nothing but trackless deserts and scorching sun. I was never more surprised in my life. Certainly there is no lack of sand & desert but the weather is sublime. Clear dry atmosphere, and nights equally as cold as our Australian winters.
