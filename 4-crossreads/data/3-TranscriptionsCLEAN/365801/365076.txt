  
 "Sandhill" Newport, I.W. 26/6/16 
 My Dear Ferguson, I cannot tell you how grieved we were to see Captain A. G. Ferguson's name in the "List of Honour" today.  No particulars of regiment or battalion are now given in our newspapers, but I fear it cannot be a coincidence - that are likely to be two men of the same rank & initials. 
 In such tragedies as this, words of consolation are idle things, but I must send you an expression of our sincerest sympathy with you all.  If there is anything I can do, such as going over to France, you have only to let me know.  There is another side to the tragedy - it's the finest death a man can die & you have a right to be proud of the sacrifice. 
 Believe me to remain Ever yours sincerely [Signature indecipherable]
