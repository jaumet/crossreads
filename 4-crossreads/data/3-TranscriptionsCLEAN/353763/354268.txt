  
 I had a bunk - there are only 3 in that funny little cabin - shut off fore & aft by red curtains from the sailor men but drawn back at bed time  -  I slept vy  -  well indeed - my first night on a submarine  -  When you sit in this small wardroom it requires but little imagination to fancy you are close to a vy  swell pantry with the walls lined with brass & pewter & silver contraptions  -  A six foot man must be careful about his head I can tell you  -  All around are electric & mechanical contrivances  The latest thing in the application of these sciences  -  At 6.30 am we had morng  -  tea & then a jolly swim & a little water polo then dress & breakfast & talk then to the beach & Stoker & I wandered &  examined the trees & ferns & rocks & got some vy good botanical specimens -  At 10.30 we all went inboard - the crew had been bathing & then AE2 came up the harbor & we passed in grand style
