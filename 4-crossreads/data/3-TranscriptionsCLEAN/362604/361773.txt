all wet & we had a much better time amongst all the jubilations in Town than we could have had in cattle trucks away out in the French Country District.  I had a walk around watching the joyful crowds.  All nations arm in arm singing & shouting, & flags were waved by thousands & nearly all the Houses had a flag or flags hanging out of the upper windows.  I had 2 glasses of Le vin blanc in which I drank all your healths.  I returned Home early & I got into a Hut amongst heaps of blankets to sleep & it was ever so much more comfortable than the Tent.  Ellis joined me at 11.30, He having gone to a Dance with the other boys.
