Lieut Cullen, [indecipherable] Hilder, Gunners Burke, Gorman and myself went to Moascar today on horseback to mark out our new camp. A Tommy Artillery Brigade was camped there and we arranged to exchange Camps which saved us making a Camp out. We had a very enjoyable ride anyhow and had tea at the Ladies Canteen going back.

Today the Brigade moved off to Moascar The Spooks were left behind as rear guard and we had a pretty hard day of it. Had some tea again at Ladies Canteen. We are having another inspection on Thursday and will probably entrain next day. I understand we have to be embarked by the 6th June. Went for a swim after tea and Y.M.C.A. after

We are going to do nothing but clean everything up preparatory to embarking We were issued with our saddle equipment today and I was all day cleaning mine up and greasing. Went for a swim after tea and spent a very pleasant hour in Y.M.C.A. after. There are not many troops camped here but it is gradually filling up. Sent letter home today.

Cleaning harness still. We have been offered a prize of 1£ for the best turned out saddle so I am having a try for it. However I don’t stand much chance as my saddle is a very old one We had an awfully good concert tonight in Y.M.C.A. given by New Zealand Hospital Glee Party. Some wonderfully good artists among them. This Camp has improved a good deal since our last camp here. Plenty of water and much better tucker.
