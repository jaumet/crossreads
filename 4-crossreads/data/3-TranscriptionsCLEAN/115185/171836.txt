They have plenty of friends in fact are over embarrassed by invitations etc. Stephanie is such a darling and Mrs Scot Skirving is very fond of her, finds comfort in having her with her. She is looking much thinner poor child - but her face is more like when she was a little girl. We passed a scarlet floating bouy today, and stopped while the officers on the bridge inspected it and had some shots of it with a rifle. Of course when we stopped we all thought it was a submarine that was sighted.
