<p>P.P.S. 5-2-15 &ndash; Oft times thought during the day is with me &ndash; an anecdote for the girls.  One told to me yesterday:/<br/>Not infrequently 'mongst the protestant congregations, comes up the question of uniting the various sections.  At the end of one of the discussions 'twas agreed amongst the chiefs that a visit seeking information, should be made to the Patriarch of the Greek Church at Moscow.  In due course several Anglican bishops and others arrived in the Russian capital.  The Patriarch listened attentively to all that was spoken and then said:&ndash; "I know much about the heretics at Rome, but of you I have never heard before.  Please give me time to investigate and think."<br/>Such is fame!</p>
<p>"Man, proud man,<br/>Drest in a little brief authority<br/>&hellip;<br/>Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven<br/>As make the angels weep."<br/>Measure for Measure ii-2.</p>
