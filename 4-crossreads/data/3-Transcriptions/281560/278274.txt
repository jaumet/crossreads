<p>18/7/16<br/>They took our blankets today and there has been much inspection of gear and equipment. We have to stand by ready to move off at half an hours notice. We get plenty of that sort of thing. Old "Digly" gave us his views and instructions concerning the fighting we may get mixed up in. All we ask is; Lead us to it;<br/>19/7/16.<br/>Muster Parade today. 16 Platoon is 75 strong. We were issued with large patches of pink cloth to sew on our backs. A careful inspection followed. This afternoon we marched out through Albert. We are resting in a field now, alongside the road that leads to the front; English troops are passing back along the road</p>
