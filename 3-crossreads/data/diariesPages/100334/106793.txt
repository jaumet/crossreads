Saturday Mch.22nd After breakfast I went along and stay a couple of hours with my Sister and then along to Holborn for Lunch and then away to Buckingham Palace to view the Great March of the Guards. All the morning the Weather was beautiful, the Sun Shining and it gave promise of a fine day, which London took advantage of. I walked down Kingsway towards the Strand and once in the Strand the Footpaths were lined with people waiting to see the procession, it was necessary to walk along the Road, Flag's were flying everywhere and from every Window of the buildings could be seen people sitting waiting their time. I wendered my way along and into the Mall and towards the Statue of the late Queen Victoria and took up a position in front of the Palace to view the King taking the Salute, a splendid account on the March is given in the National News, written
