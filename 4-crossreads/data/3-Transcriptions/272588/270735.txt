<p>Tuesday 9 July<br/>A bit of a scratch match at cricket to-day. To-night I went down to the "Sentimental Blokes" near Hazebrouck, &amp; the concert was very decent.  The girl was fine in fact she becomes more chic daily. A stunt is coming off to-night and we are standing by.</p>
<p>Wednesday 10 July<br/>Raining to-day &amp; thundery.  The stunt of last night resulted in 30 prisoners &amp; about 60 wounded for us.  Visit 3rd Brigade Concert party.</p>
