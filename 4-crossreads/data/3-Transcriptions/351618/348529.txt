<p>last found our departure was postponed till tomorrow. Alas another night on board the "Southland"</p>
<p>Saturday 19th<br/>Mustupha is a place of much concern as all wounded soldiers to their sorrow soon learn. A few weeks there and back your turn to where the bullets fly and make you squirm.</p>
<p>Scotty and I met in this place of renown.<br/>It wasn't all comfort or feather down.<br/>We were there a few weeks on bread and jam and good hot tea that made you very down.</p>
<p>Now we are off where the bullets fly<br/>and hope to meet again in the Street bye and bye.</p>
<p>Limerick to Cecil Thomas Scott (RMLI)<br/>58 Alexandra St, Warsop, Notts.</p>
<p>We were all day waiting on board</p>
