Working with the Platoon. Showing them some stunts no word of my being gazetted yet; though I do the work. On parade today the Colonel gave us the "dinkum oil". There is trouble before us.

A Churchparade this morning where the padre piled on the agony about being killed in action. Then we moved this afternoon, to a point near Dickebusche, being comveyed in motor buses along the Ypres road. Have possies in the old trenches.
