<p>Jan '18<br/>old hands who have been to France before &amp; are bent on all the fun they can get out of the last few hours on this side There is a good deal of drinking allways is traveling  &amp; all moves in the army to quote Omar Khayyam "What without asking hither hurried. Whence.<br/>And without knowing, Whether hurried hence"<br/>or I think that is it</p>
<p>Wednesday 23rd<br/>Had a very light breakfast of Bread &amp; Bacon at 6 a m &amp; marched back to the Boat &amp; straight on board &amp; anchored in the harbour all day. Southampton seems a fine place what little I saw of it. There are a lot of horses on board &amp; a fair number of troops. There is no sleeping accomidation. Hunted all over the place &amp; could not find a decent posie It is a dead calm night so no sickness Have done well for tucker could buy bread &amp; tea or cocoa from the sailors &amp; had plenty of 'billie' The engins have just stopped 4.15 AM so suppose we are at Le Harve</p>
