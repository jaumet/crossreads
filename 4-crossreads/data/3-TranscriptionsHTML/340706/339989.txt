<p>I manage to get down for lunch.</p>
<p>We pass two depots for tanks at one of which there must have been at least 200 in rows. On return to my carriage I find Col Dicken of Shropshire &amp; Junior Carlton Club in my compartment &amp; we have a good yarn.</p>
<p>After much slow progress we reach Etaples. The usual time of journey for a troop train is 7 &frac12; hrs &amp; yet we are 29 hours late. Have supper at the Etaples Club for 2 fr. I have 2 large plates of meat &amp; chips &amp; go down to station to catch train at midnight. However as she does not go till 2 am I sleep in a YMCA on the station at railway yard &amp; am called at 2. Train however is no hurry &amp; does not leave till 4.20. We have a brasier in waggon there are no carriages on train &amp; towards morning feel the effects so badly that I have to hang outside the train to get fresh air.</p>
<p>11-1-1919<br/>Arrived at Abbeville. There is another officer getting out here G H Jones 227 Field Coy RE-BEF. He say that if I throw out my valise at the cloak room it will save being carried back. He throws it out &amp; it immediately falls back under the train &amp; is hopelessly cut about &amp; covered in grease. So dirty is it that the disagreeable chap in cloakroom refused to take it</p>
