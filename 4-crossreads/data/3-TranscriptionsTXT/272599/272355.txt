 1917 Sunday 25 March 
 A beautiful bright sunny day. Such a welcome change to the cold bleak ones we've had. One could almost imagine himself back in dear old sunny N.S.W.   Tiny finches are appearing in the brakes &amp; hedges chirping of the advent of Spring &amp; the sky-larks are actually carolling high up out of sight in the clear air of the morning as I write. Is the grim struggle going on in all its intensity but a few miles away? Yes! one can hear the dull boom of guns, that can only bear one interpretation, &amp; the tireless air scouts are buzzing overhead in their bright aluminium cages.   Purposed visiting Tony this afternoon but find it is pay day &amp; also there is to be a memorial service in memory of poor Bill Parsons tonight.
