1917Fri. 22nd June.The explosion of these caused the vessel to sink a couple of feet on an even keel - but no further.
Later, an enormous bomb was taken over and placed in the poop & kerosene was sprinkled over the decks.
The bomb caused a terrific explosion - which appeared to take an upward track & nearly succeeded in blowing off the poop & displacing the mainmast.   Another bomb had no better result - and the water-logged vessel would not fire.
These bombs were each apparently more than half the size of a mine!
After the bombing failure shelling was commenced.   All the afternoon shells were poured into the little vessel - not one of which succeeded in hitting a mast.
Shelling was stopped at dusk, after between 30 & 40 shells had been fired.
