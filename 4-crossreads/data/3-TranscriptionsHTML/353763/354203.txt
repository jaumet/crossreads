<p>There is a 'buz' round &ndash; from the wireless station &ndash; that 3 British Cruisers have been sunk by German Submarines in the N.Sea  -  The Aboukir-Hopple Cressy<strike>Euryalus is one of them  - </strike>We hear that they attacked Kiel harbor &ndash; doubtless by Order &ndash; also &ndash; that the Allied left wing of our armies have thrown the German right wing back  -  We'll hope its true  -</p>
<p>My personal equation isnt very much &ndash; a fine swim this morning &amp; a few minor cares to attend to  -  <u>Yesterday</u> ie Friday aftn  -  I was ashore &ndash; (Grantala medicoes have been <u>here 2 weeks &amp; not</u> allowed ashore ) -  Haggard &amp; I went together &amp; explored the park &amp; acclimatisation gardens  -  We got to a point marked Zum Ficus &ndash; wekk we'd been  <strike>there</strike> to the Figs &ndash; that was to our right &ndash; We went Zum?
