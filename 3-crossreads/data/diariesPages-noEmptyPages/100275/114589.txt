Am on Headquarters guard today a pretty snaggy job for you have to so particular see that everything is done correctly, one of the intended guards was shot in the clink he was helplessly drunk has been the same for the last 2 days.
About an hour after I had taken the guard over, a guard came along from D. Coy. there had been a mistake on their part, their Coy don't come on till tomorrow.
Our Artillery have been passing through here all day some going in some coming out, they reckon it is still a deathtrap.
Two French priests have just passed me they wear big long black
