<p>15/4/19<br/>Marcinelle<br/>Took a walk up towards the Waxworks but did not go in. An attempt was made to steal our horses last night but failed and I tried a foolish looking chap of the 17th Battalion &amp; remanded him for Court Martial. From the Cavalry Barracks last night twelve birds escaped. In days past this never happened &ndash; now corruption is rife.  <br/>At midday went up to the Waxworks and had a look at the horrors there. Took afternoon tea at the mess having first wandered out and done some shopping. A windy thundery and showery day. Spent the evening with the Cornils.</p>
