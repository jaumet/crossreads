<p>Dear Mum,<br/>This is the other end of the Town from us about 3 &frac12; miles. We have to walk everywhere here as motors at 1/- each way are too expensive. Dave &amp; I walked over 15 miles last Saturday afternoon. We sat in the Market place &amp; eat dough nuts &amp; custard tarts with tea. We had tea later with Billy in the Main Street. This is quite a large Village &amp; has a street with about a dozen shops in it. It rains 2 days out of every 3 here but it is not cold yet. I had a hot &amp; cold shower tonight so it is easy to keep clean. this Village is about 3 miles from our  camp. The people here speak quite plainly being used to Australians.   Love Harry</p>
