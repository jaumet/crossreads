 11 o'clock service at All Saints' Cairo &amp; in the afternoon after having a look at the Armenian scouts &amp; dropping in to a Children's Service at 'All Saints' went round to the Rectory for afternoon tea (Rev &amp; Mrs Horan). The O.C. arrived back from Luxor this morning looking pretty fit. The past week has been a very pleasant one for me &ndash; time my own. Have been getting plenty of exercise. Up every morning at 6 &amp; drilling until breakfast time. Out practically every morning, afternoon &amp; evening visiting new places of interest, attending meetings of English, French, Jewish &amp; Armenian Scouts, going to a couple of places of entertainment &amp; keeping up usual French lessons.
