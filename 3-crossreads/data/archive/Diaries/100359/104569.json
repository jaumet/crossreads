No one goes to bed early as it does not get dark till about half ? past ten and we cant go to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a5299083\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 83]<br><br />\nof the notice for the first time said \"Hommes, there was heavy fighting there, I read in the \"paper\" Now it is classed among our Ambs.
