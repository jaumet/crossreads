<p>heard about it.</p>
<p>You're certainly not missing much at present, unless its much to be guarding the canal from sandstorms &amp; desert. Occasionally enemy patrols are sighted thousands of miles out, &amp; now &amp; again we get bushed when visiting our own standing patrols by night, but beyond that there is very little excitement. When I say excitement I mean active excitement, there is always a sort of latent excitement just kept aflow by the various rumours that keep on flying about.</p>
<p>One particular bit of news kept my pecker up, the substance of which was that if certain things happened I would get another rise in rank, but as certain things were delayed, I'm afraid field rank as far as I'm concerned, has been knocked on the head for the present.</p>
