<p>8.  are rather haughty fashionable <strike>hi</strike> dames and not pleasant to work with, still it does not matter much for there is not much opportunity for knowing or being known, only sometimes they hurt one's feelings a bit in their superior ways.  They are mostly from the well-known fashionable Shepheard's Hotel, so Sister Lucie says, but I can't help thinking they must be really kind-hearted to bother to go &amp; help there at all.<br/>Sister Lucie does not improve on acquaintance she is spoiled by the notice the soldiers take of her, or that she says they take &amp; I get sick of hearing little egotistic things, though of course in the main she is absolutely lady-like &amp; must be good to spend all her time for the Y.M. as she does, it is only that she is getting a little bit old &amp; silly- perhaps I mean too old to show such silliness, for she is quite young really, only about 38 or 40.<br/>I wish I had more to do for the soldiers but am keeping a look out, it is no use worrying when there are such lots of nurses here idle, &amp; other very important folk.<br/>Must close &amp; post this.  My love to Jobber and your dear dear selves,<br/>Very lovingly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your daughter<br/>Olive.</p>
