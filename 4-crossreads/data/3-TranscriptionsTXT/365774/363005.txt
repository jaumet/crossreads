 9th April 1915 My dearest Mother I am very sorry I cannot write you a long letter but our letters are being severely censored &amp; anything that tells about our whereabouts numbers etc. is pounced upon. All the boys you know are well Ray &amp; Rupert being exceptionally so. I am in the very best of health in fact never felt better in my life. Well mother dear as I haven't written to anyone else this time but you &amp; don't know when I shall, please let all enquirers know I am OK etc. Give my love to Lizzie &amp; Dave so as not to get this delayed or worse destroyed I will close with fondest love from Your loving son Ken
