<p>Monday 30 April 1917</p>
<p>Posted notes yesterday acknowledging letters from home March 19. Quite cold for a change. We are still having a rough time.</p>
<p>[The following sentence crossed through.]  I am glad JOE saw he is indispensable at home &amp; doing more than his Bit.</p>
<p>I look forward to a reunion some day soon. Enemy plane with black + on wings is soaring above me as I write, &amp; the little rings of bursting shells from our Anti aircraft now all around her but never hit &ndash; as far as we know. On Outpost last night &amp; digging Trenches today with Stables, to do it gives little time for the men to cook, delouse themselves or sleep &ndash; but men &amp; horses are fit &amp; cheery. <strike>Wise not to discuss my DIARY if Military is hearing</strike>.</p>
