8ashamed to think they 'squeaked' that is the spirit of them all. Australia is now a nation, the greatest fighting nation of our hemisphere. If Australians only knew what her boys have done, are doing, & will do, they would not give the foolish twaddle they do in their papers as a means of raising recruits. There is no one on the peninsula except Sheiks who can go with them, no one who will follow them. For this reason they lead every move. But I have formed lots of opinions, some about Kitchener's army and England's sluggish methods which I will not give here - as I am still a soldier. But when I get back I'll tell you.
A story
Bill enquired today to see if he could get some pay before going into convalescent hosp. in England. "I've lost my pay book," he said, "and they would not give me any in Alexandria, but I must have money Sir." Where did you lose it "said the Colonel. "In the last charge, sir"!! said Bill.
Well I hope everyone is as well as I am. Is Hazel drawing the allotment regularly?
Whips of love to all. Your loving son
