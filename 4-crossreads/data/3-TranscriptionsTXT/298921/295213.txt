 August, 1915 Monday 30 Henry was blocked from going to Australia, &amp; is now back in Hospital here with a sort of Infuenza &ndash; He was Boarded &amp; told to do duty at Alexandria &ndash; bad luck after building on going home. He is in bed alongside. He has just told Col: Mandesley that he is a breeder of Shorthorns &amp; Sheep in the Riverina. We just stopped him using an empty Hot water bag (which the sister had left alongside bed) as a urine bottle!! I have found out the use of the piano &ndash; it drowns the squeals of the men when the poor beggars are getting their dressings done &amp; others coming out of anaesthetic "Long live the piano"!
