20th. Fine bright day. Course NW by N, N, NE & E at 5.30. Am told on good authority that our detour has taken us well over 1000 M west of the trade route & consequently we wont get to old Blitie before 27 or 28 Inst.
21st ENE, heavy swell running. This is our 63rd day out from Melbourne. We are all reckoning on a fine pay after landing. £4/6/- owing me to date. Medical experiment in progress – Several down up to date. Our turn to-morrow. have a cold but don’t expect any trouble with the M.O. as regards fitness. Got my notes jotted down on old Lincoln & at Mt Aureol & am entering them here in case the other papers go astray. We have difficulty this way as one cant always carry ones things about in onship rig, & the spirit of comradeship – the Esprit de corps – of our army is so fine that nothing is safe from the sneak thief and the casual pilferer. While on this tack we wonder would people ever give to war funds if they could see the misuse & scoundrelism that goes on. One of our chaps bought a box of chocolates from stores today
