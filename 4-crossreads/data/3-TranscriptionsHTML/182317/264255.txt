<p>Now take care of yourself and don't try and get well too fast but make the cure a permanent one. Kiss Hettie for me if she will allow you &amp; give my love to all my Ladies who go to see you particularly Mrs Wisdom &amp; Miss Everett &amp; Mrs Rudall. Good bye. Kindest regards from all here. Yours Sincerely, William Holmes</p>
