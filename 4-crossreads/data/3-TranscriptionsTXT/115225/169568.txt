to a dump at Blangy Tronville & went to Ialeux railhead & delivered a load of ammo to. Corps reserve dump on the Paris road & again to railhead for a load to take back to Park - my engine started to run very stiff but I was able to get back to park alright. we saw two German tanks at the railhead which have just been captured. they are heavy & ugly looking things & dont look as efficient a weapon as ours
 
May 29th  We put off our load of ammo & pulled into the 5th M.T.

We had a parade called & were informed that "Ren" had been awarded 90 days No 2 field punishment & he went to Poullainville bird cage to do it -
The stuffed hawk that I souvenired on the 14th I mounted on the canopy of my lorry where it looked as though it had just ali landed there & it
