<p>Very probably I would have had half the population of the town yelling at my heels and no amount of persuasion or threat would drive them off. We Camped again last night in the market place which is enclosed by high iron railings very close together. The whole population came crowding around these rails asking for the inevitable "Backsheesh" "Clamouring" would be a better word They some had eggs to sell or oranges or lemonade. But the whole population had one thought in the minds &ndash; What can I Steal?" Little bits of nippers reminding one of half civilized dingoes would ferret out something saleable and handy to the railings where we had placed our saddles and watch for an opportunity to grab it &amp; run The Native police were flogging they away with their whips but these people are so near to animal in their nature that while the "Shawish" flogs them away from the railings they re-form at his back. Nothing short of a bullet will stop them We must save those we may have better use for them yet.</p>
