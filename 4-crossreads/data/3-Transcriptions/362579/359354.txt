<p>A car was going from here with patients to Doulllens, passing through Frevent   &amp;  we were asked if we would care to go, so we accepted immediately. Left here about 10 a.m. It is an awfully pretty drive   &amp;   was an ideal day for motoring. We both sat in front. Arrived at 6th Stat. about 11.30 a.m.  &amp;  the family were delighted to see us. Had a bonza time, had luncheon with them. Saw al my pals (girls)   &amp;  had a great yarn. Just as we were leaving who should come to see them but two of our own Medical Officers</p>
