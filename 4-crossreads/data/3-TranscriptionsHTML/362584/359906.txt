<p>France<br/>20th April 1916</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>In posting my last letter to you, I forgot to enclose these photos. The post card was taken on board the Havenford on our way over. I'm sitting on the left of Col. Lloyd. I was in the same ward &amp; in the next bed to him while I was in hospital. The other photo is the battalion officers taken in France.</p>
