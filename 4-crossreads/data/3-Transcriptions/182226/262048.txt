<p>I have struck some tough goes out here, but today has been about as bad as any. The only thing in its favour was that it was sharp &amp; short. It was a 6 hour nightmare.</p>
<p>We left Ferry post at about 9 a.m. &amp; struck out in the desert towards the trenches with a full pack &amp; from then it became a ceaseless struggle through the sand &amp; rain till 4 p.m. I was at my last gasp several times but I managed to keep up with the column, through the ankle deep sand &amp; ended dead beat like every one else. We are now camped in the sand with the prospect of stopping there till after the Turks have made their dash.</p>
