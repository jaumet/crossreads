<p>We were paid today, but I did not draw any money.</p>
<p>Thursday April 18. 1918. 1354.<br/>cloudy &amp; misty.</p>
<p>Last night was very quiet not much artillery work. A raid is daily expected from Fritz.</p>
<p>After dinner today we packed up to leave here to go to a little village called Franvillers about   kilometres away, and further to the rear. The Transports got away by 2.30 and the cook &amp; I with several others remained behind to guard what was left until the Limbres returned.</p>
<p>We left about 4 and arrived an hour later at our destination in a dilapitaded old village consisting mostly of mud &amp; plaster houses on brick foundations. We had to light a fire against a wet wall in a corner &amp; it was 8 o'clock before it was ready, but we had comfortable billets to go into for the night.</p>
<p>Friday April 19. 1918. 1355.<br/>Cloudy all day, light showers &amp; a few flakes</p>
