 Wed. Oct. 17.  Wet, dull day.  Had a good read "Smoke Bellew".  Doctor came round after Dinner, &amp; marked me for X Ray.  Red X Ladies brought Cigarettes &amp; a "Bulletin".  They stayed quite a while &amp; we had a good old yarn.  Received Letter from Ruth.  They are expecting a Convoy in tonight &amp; the Nurses &amp; maids are rushing about like a Ration Party, carrying Blankets etc. 
 Thur. 18.  15 men came in last night.  Judging by the excitement I thought there would be, at least, 100.  The doc. came in during the night &amp; borrowed my "Bulletin".  I was X Rayed just before dinner.  There is still a piece of shrapnel in my Leg.  It shewed on the plate, so I guess that means they will make another cut.  The Sister made my visit to the X Ray department quite interesting, as she explained to me the process.  Whilst waiting for the lift to return me to the Ward I struck up a yarn with a Girl waiting to be X Rayed, &amp; found out that she had been wounded by a Bomb which fell in London during an Air Raid.  She was driving a Tram at the Time, &amp; was injured in 6 places.  As it was such a glorious day, they put "Smithy" &amp; I out on the verandah.  Wrote Aunt Nell &amp; Mrs Pudney.
