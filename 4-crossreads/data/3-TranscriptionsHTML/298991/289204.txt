<p>Tuesday August 21st.</p>
<p>Boat roll called out today, but I was not on it. Went to a very good concert in the Y.M.C.A this evening. It was Miss Carroll's party from Bournemouth, &amp; every item was very good</p>
<p>Wednesday August 22nd<br/>The weather is quite good now. I got quite a shock this morning when I read last nights orders, &amp; saw I was transferred from B2BH to C2H. The latter is home service in Australia, so that isn't too bad. I also got another surprise this afternoon, when my name was called out to go to Verne, so I expect we will soon be going back to dear old Ausey.</p>
<p>Left Monte Video at 3 p.m. &amp; marched to Melcombe Regis Railway station, where we entrained for Portland. From Portland to Verne it is about 2 miles, &amp; up hill all the way, it knocked the wind out of me climbing it. Verne is right on top of a very big hill with an outlook over the sea in three directions, &amp; Weymouth in the other. It appears that this has been an old convict place once, but has since been made into a garrison. We are camped in tents here, &amp; there are two tents to a mess. Four blankets were issued to us, &amp; they are needed sleeping on the ground</p>
