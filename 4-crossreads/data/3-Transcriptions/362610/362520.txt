<p>Tuesday 31 October 1916<br/>A good deal of rain during the night. Up at 4.30 to go up the line with the General. After a cup of tea had to wait some time for General Walker to come along, setting out about 6 a.m. Strong cold wind but no rain during the morning. The ground was quite a bog &amp; the trenches in an awful state, the sides falling in on all hands &amp; the mud &amp; slush being in places up to the groin. Dugouts of course were flooded excepting where they had quite fallen in, &amp; in the trenches were rifles, equipment &amp; all manner of gear, simply smothered with mud. And yet shortly after the sun had appeared the men were all bustle &amp; seemed as cheerful &amp; happy as possible. General Walker soon turned back, but the Brigadier &amp; I were along the line for a long time, arriving home wet &amp; muddy abt. 11 o'clock. Had to lie in a blanket &amp; get breeches dried as well as possible, the afternoon, with the exception of 1 or 2 breaks when rain &amp; hail fell being clear &amp; fine. One of the men counted 52 aeroplanes up, besides 20 odd sausage balloons.</p>
