<p>News all points in one favour just now but somehow I can't believe that the<br/>Germans will give down suddenly. There will be heavy fighting before they are driven out of Belgium &amp; we all feel quite disappointed that Mr. Hughes has not brought in cons-cription so that the men may all be in training at once &amp; ready to send along in the early spring.</p>

<p>Good night dear; we are hoping for a letter by tomorrow's mail. With love from us all</p>
<p>Mother.</p>
