Extract:- "A Magic Stone" Robert Blatchford."I love diamonds - love them for their beauty, for their fire, their colour, their sparkle, their distinction.   Rubies are splendid;   opals have mystery; sapphires remind one of the sea;  pearls are pretty in their purity.   But diamonds for me.   Diamonds are like stars and roses and peacock's tails and summer clouds:  they are royal;  they are alive;  they have souls;  they drink up sunshine like champagne, and then flash out marvellous and valiant dreams.   I love 'em."  etc.
There is imagination there!
