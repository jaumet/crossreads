 Got up earli and went to Fountainbleau with YMCA Parti . It is situat about forti mile from Pari and it is here that the famous Forest of Fountainbleau is . We spent a veri pleasant hour in the quaint town . Had lunch in the Hotel Cadian . Had we not seen the Palac of Versaill we would have consid the Palac of Fountainbleau magnific Still it was a most beauti place insid and contain beauti room and beauti pictur . The Palac date back befor Napoleon 's time but it histori is interwoven with the life of Napoleon . It is useless for me even to attempt to describ these place , they have got to be seen in order to be fulli appreci We drove through the magnific Forest of Fountainbleau in a Char-a-banc . The day was pretti hot and the cool drive in the shade of the tree was delight . We had our Photo taken with the Maid of the Forest . This " Maid of the Forest " had a caf near the Swing Rock and she gave us an exhibit of shake this rock . I could not move the stone but she , be as the say is "like the end of a hous " I would much rather have her stand on the top of the huge Swing Rock than stand on the top of me We return to Pari at 6.p.m .
