    Then Sunday dawned with the chiming of Church Bells, too late for kirk we wandered through old Edinburgh, the Grassmarket, Canongate, Cowgate, John Knox's House, The Toll Booth, Holyrood Palace and Park, King Arthur's Seat, with views of the Burns Monument and other edifices on the Calton Hill, back through Princes Street to view the Scott Monument and Gardens and back to the club thoroughly tired having seen much in the slums of old Edinburgh that impressed us with our own happy state in Australia.  The afternoon found us on top of a tram going to the seaside suburb of Porto Bello, but we did not dally there, the wind was too bitterly cold and the rain came again. 
    After deciding to sacrifice our dinner and eating High Tea instead, we went to church at "St.Mary's Cathedral" Anglican and greatly enjoyed the service and singing, the anthem was an old favourite, "This land that was desolate" and the male choir rendered it gloriously, the pure notes ascending unbroken to the vaulted ceiling, the organ a wonder of beauty. 
    Then back to the Club, a few letters written, bed and up the next morning to catch the 10 a.m. train to London seeing as we passed Durham Cathedral and York Minster besides much of lesser and commercial interest.  Pleasant companions helped the tedious hours to fly and by 8 p.m. we were in London, too weary for theatres.  The next day, it was the last day of leave, squaring up my business, packing my kit, dodging here and there in the city then in the evening, dinner and the theatre.
