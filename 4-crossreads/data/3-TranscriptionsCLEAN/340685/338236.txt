  
 in the town hall which had a fine floor where we slept comfortably 14.10.16 Next morning after some preliminary wandering about started on the way through Abneke and with a strong wind we finally started at about 11 o'clock and arrived at about 3.30 at Watten just through the town and are camped in a farm where there are 8 Belgian refugees. Before entering the town we climbed a high hill from which we obtained a fine view of the surrounding town and on the top was an old chateau guarded by two forts with sentries over them. The town also has a trench system protecting it. The view was very beautiful with winding canals, railways, houses and farms. in the evening after obtaining a leave pass we went into Watten although supposed to be out of bounds and had a good look round at the fair sized town. We struck a brewery and had on inspection and were offered a drink of gin, rum, whiskey, brandy,  rum  or wine and had a brandy which was very good and on the way home some beer and "malagher". This seems to be our permanent training place. 15.10 16 Parade at 9.30 to 11.30 for rifle inspection and drill and also at 2 to - 4 and in the evening I went early to bed. it was very cold and looked frosty. 16.10.16 Very cold last night and it rained a bit Dare & Kernot came in very "boozed". First parade at 6.30 and went for a march for a while and were told I was on guard at 9 A.M. Got letters addressed to Pioneers Battalion and a parcel from Auntie Sarah. Spent the off hours in writing this up. 17.10.16 peter Kemp turned up in the afternoon yesterday so we put him in the guard room to await court martial. Searchlight active all round us during the night presumably looking for aeroplanes. Rained during my 1 - 3 guard at 1.45 so I laid down inside. Fairly cold. Dismissed this morning at 9 and am putting in the off time until 2 o'clock in getting clean and writing letters. Eileens photo to-day. 1st & 2nd Brigades went through yesterday and are camped considerably further on than we are. First Field Company camped adjacent to us.
