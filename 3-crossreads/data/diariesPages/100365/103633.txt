which is 6 miles from Paris. We went on another line so did not go through the City much to our disappointment, but skirted round it.However I saw The Eiffel Tower also got a glimpse of the City itself.Our next stop on the Nord line was Amiens through which the Germans came although they ravaged the women took them away to Germany they never had time to spoil the crops City. Amiens is a very large City looks well.All the way along we were accorded a royal welcome. Further along we could see great military activity a very pretty sight is to see the long columns of Troops vehicles winding over the Mountainous Country.There are Canals running everyway all the wounded are brought right from the front in big Barges built for this purpose.It is nothing to see as many as 20 of these huge things on their way to the Base.We finally arrived at our destination at 6.30 pm we all heaved a sigh of relief.Our Company is now in a rest Camp at a place called Abbeville".
