 1916 &nbsp; TUESDAY 18 &nbsp; JULY 
 A decent warm day at last. M r &nbsp;Neylan had us for flag drill in morning &amp; we &nbsp;were working the helio-graph in afternoon. It is interesting work in the open like this. I received a paper (Sunday Times) from Linda and a letter from Alan from Scotland. Had a game of Cricket and some kicks at the football in evening 
 &nbsp; 
 Here&#39;s to the man who plans things&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; 
 Builds things&nbsp;&mdash; makes things&nbsp;&mdash; 
 Who prates not of wonders of old; 
 Nor gloats on&nbsp;ancestral gold, 
 But takes off his coat &amp; takes a hold, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp;And does things.
