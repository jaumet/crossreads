still raining nothing doing, I heard today that Fritz has captured St Julian is now holding it. Our Casualties up to date have been very light from reports Fritz has had a lot killed.
Saturday 4/8/17
We attacked Fritz again today forced him out of St Julien now we are holding it it will not revert again to Fritz. I obtained leave went into Poperinghe for a change, while I was walking about I noticed some Purple Ribbon in a shop. I bought  yard was directed to a Tailoress who had some Terricotta Red in stock, so I got her to make me our Regimental Colours, as up to date Headquarters had not supplied us with them as all the other Australian Regiments had theirs I decided to buy my own. They cost me 1 Franc each, the Colours are Red 2  inch square with 1 5/8 inch diamond of Purple with the number of our Corp 59
