<p>[Handwritten page of notes relevant to AE1's disappearance]<br/>She disappeared in St George's Channel between Islands of New Britain and New Ireland between 2 &amp; 4 pm  Some theories as to her fate:-</p>
<p>1. <u>Motor trouble.</u>  One of her main electric motors being out of repair she dived &amp; slightly overtrimmed- that is had not buoyancy enough with her one remaining motor to give complete control &amp; finally she became unmanageable &amp; sank.<br/>11.<u> An old enemy Tug boat</u> was found beached, having been set on fire by her crew who had decamped.  This tugboat had on board a Nordenfell gun 5 barrel which may have been used unexpectedly by some one in hiding as the AE1 lay on the surface nearby.<br/>111. <u>Enemy Mines</u> This theory is hardly probable because there were no harbours which had not been thoroughly swept &amp; searched.</p>
<p>The cause of her disappearance is still a mystery.  She was out in company with the "Destroyer Parramatta" &amp; this boat left her to go down the chanel for another 25 miles.  When the "Parramatta" had returned no trace of AE1 .  They thought she had returned to harbour.  However as no trace of her cld. be found a full search was made by all the available boats but without success.<br/>Diligent &amp; stringent cross examination of the natives nearby by the Commander of H.M.S. "Encounter" reached no satisfaction.</p>
