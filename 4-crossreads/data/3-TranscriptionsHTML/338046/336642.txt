Next morning, we (the signallers and runners found another place, a sort of storeroom closed on three sides with brick walls and opening onto a platform for loading cement into trucks. Bob Goldie (I think) discovered a tarpaulin and got permission from some Froggies, to whom the tarpaulin did not belong to keep it. we nailed the tarp over the front of the storeroom and were all nicely settled when the transport officer came along with his hoboes and said that they had been given that position, so we reluctantly moved taking with us, our tarpaulin, to the transports disgust. McDermott salvaged another big tarpaulin from a railway truck and we made another joint in a corner we also commandeered a bale of hay from the transport and carefully his it underneath our original.</p>
