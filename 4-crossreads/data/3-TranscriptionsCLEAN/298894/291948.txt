weather very fine. Turks shelled us during the day one landing in the hospital but did no damage. I was working in the Pier & the nearest to me was close on 100 yds. The Marquee which had been struck by a shell suddenly burst into flame about midday & was totally destroyed with contents luckily no patients were inside. This tent has been singularly unlucky. Four times it was damaged by shellfire while all others escaped & now was finished for good. In the evening we carried up seven dead from the Pier a most unpleasant duty. At night orders came for us to return to Lemnos with the exception of 14 there was open rejoicing from many. They had had their fill of war already.
Friday July 2nd Packed up & handed over our dugout to those remaining & very sorry I was to leave it as it was extremely comfortable. Whilst we were on the pier at 11 A.M. awaiting a pinnace to take us off the shelling recommenced forcing us to take cover. It was very severe & one shell landing in the water sent the spray all over me. The second last shell caught the naval Lieutenant in charge of the pier & took off part of his foot & also wounded his companion. It was only a few minutes previously he had joked with us on the pier. We went on board the "Hythe" to set off for Lemnos about 3.30 P.M.
