<p>Our battalion was not the only one on board, and I was delighted to find several members of the Legion of Frontiersmen, <strike>with</strike> whom I had drilled and camped with at Dee Why, Sydney, and we "swapped" yarns.  We passed by innumerable islands of an archipelago, <strike>and</strike> apparently <strike>took</strike> taking a circuitous course, so as to dodge the foe.  A few days later, we arrived at Lemnos Island, and stayed there two days, <strike>and enjoyed</strike> enjoying ourselves swimming about the harbor, which is of decent size.  The Greeks came alongside in boats selling fruit, tobacco &amp; sweetmeats and were soon sold out;  especially in chocolate.</p>
<p>We transhipped here aboard the fast steamer "Osmanieh" and were brought to Anzac early that night, and kept off the shores for a few hours.  A number of warships speeded by in the darkness with lights out, and I saw a number bombarding the Turkish trenches.  It was with mingled awe, and trepidation that we regarded these things, and everybody spoke in whispers.  A huge dark mass loomed in front of us, <strike>and it was</strike> dotted here and there with lights, indeed a mysterious place.  Rifle and machine gun firing was plainly heard, and now and then a jet of flame spurted, followed by the explosion of a shell.  A hospital ship was not very far away, <strike>and looked</strike> looking a pretty sight with the green lights around it and a big Red Cross glowing in the centre.</p>
