<p>17 July 1916<br/>Monday</p>
<p>Rained all night, slept in huts on bumpy ground.  Feeling good, pack not so heavy. discarded more of my belongings at last place.<br/>Stay in our billets all day. Huts unhealthy, damp mould on ground.<br/>Pay in afternoon. 40 francs. Short rations for tea, go down to village &amp; supplement same with eggs and cafe. Mud &amp; slush on road very slippery. Talk with some French soldiers. Mutual effort to speak each others lingo. not too successful. <br/>Impromptu concert in hut on return</p>
