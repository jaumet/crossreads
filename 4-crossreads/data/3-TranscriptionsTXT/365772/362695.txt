 Give my love to Dad &amp; Mother I never write to the former but I know you give him all the news &amp; tell the Mater I will very likely miss her this mail &amp; as for Ulmarra I havn't written for months so will have to be careful anyway when it is all sifted out there is only you Dad &amp; Mother worth writing to, a chap drops a lot of sentiment etc. here &amp; gets rather hard &amp; callous so forgive me dear if I dont write too affectionately, but we know one another dont we Lizzie you are sweetheart sister &amp; all to me. I will close now with fondest love to R B &amp; self from Ken
