<p>the side kicked up a [dash] of a row. After a lot of trouble we got safely into Mudros Bay, and when we awoke the next morning the most wonderful sight in the world was before us. This was Wednesday November 17th. Of course the first thing to do was to pack up our kit ready to go ashore, but the lads were disappointed. The sight before our eyes, was about a dozen fine Hospital Ships, much bigger than those visiting Australia, Troopships of all sizes, and from the latest Battleship down to the smallest Submarine. Hydroplanes were there also, and paddle-wheel boats, which travel about 20 knots. Mother, one can never describe this place. Battle ships and Men-of-War going in and out, as well as Troopships, and Hospital Ships. Well Mother, this is no description but when I get home, I hope to give more news. Towards noon a Southerly Gale sprang up, and the old "Argyllshire" dragged anchor and slowly but surely drifted on to the "Guildford Castle" Hospital Ship, and bumped with a tremendous crash, and smashed two of our life-boats. There was much excitement on board, especially on the other ship. After freeing ourselves from this ship, just missed the "Gloucester Castle" by inches. The old "Argyllshire" still keeps the record, &ndash; towards evening, nearly went ashore and only for the wind dropping, we would have gone ashore.</p>
<p>We spent most of the time on deck watching the boats going to and fro, and wondering all the time when we should go off ourselves.</p>
<p>While we lay in this Bay, on the boat till December 4th, one could write a book if time could have been spared. We was four of the largest Ships afloat. "Acquitania" 50,000 tons, "Britanic"</p>
