Monday, 15.Took over duties at reveille 5.15 this morning. Fall in 5.45am. I have no friends here and it leaves one with a queer sense of depression and the feeling that one can never be at home here. The constant change of the last few months too, is having its reaction and one feels that one is indeed a "Wanderer". More singing (evening) some fine voices. "Soldier's Farewell" "The End of a Perfect Day".
Tuesday, 16.Orderly Sergeant for the day. Plenty to do. Was pleased to get the job as it gave me an insight into things. W.O. Campbell who has improved out of all recognition, (though the fellows hate him) called me up last night to explain my duties. He sort of spoke challengingly, but I told him straight out that I would do my whack etc. and it sort of broke the ice.
Wednesday, 17.Am beginning to feel more at home. The fellows are a decent lot---mostly Tasmanians, though there is a representative or two of all the States, and an Irishman, an Englishman and an American.
My French improving---though mostly patois spoken round here. The older people difficult to understand.
Thursday 18.Usual routine.
Friday, 19.Usual routine. Interpreter for the day, finding out depths of water in wells round about the billet.
Saturday, 20.Usual routine morning. Afternoon---sports. Wrote letters. In evening concert. Very fine double quartette "The End of a Perfect Day". "Soldier's Farewell", I sang "Boys of Tasmanian's Clime", and Tipperary and Marseillaise in French.
