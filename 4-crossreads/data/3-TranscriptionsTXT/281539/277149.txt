 10/10/15  Good sleep after stand to arms. A fine cool typical Australian day; plenty to do and lot of messing up from Bde. who are "on their ear". Peppered with high explosive during afternoon and although N. De B. buried under ruins of his dug out no one badly injured beyond a couple of flesh wounds We have some "points d'appui" a technical term too tough for the "warbs" who call them the "points der putty".  Shell hit clip of cartridges in pouches and exploded them but no harm done. During afternoon rally when shower of high explosive was going two Abduls poked their heads up to observe effect. Quite comical the way they threw their arms up when our bullets went through them. Being in such close contact with the men breeds a sort of friendly familiarity particularly as saluting &amp; ceremonial are all dropped. Will have to watch or they will be calling their officers by Christian names. Issued lime juice ration 1/10 of a gill to each man. An orderly (old chap) from "C" Co sitting outside. Gave him balance of rum ration left over from last time &ndash; a good stiff tot. He greatly delighted. "Ere's luck to yer, Sir &amp; to Orsetralie". The same gentleman had the nosecap blown off his rifle today but escaped himself unhurt. His lucky day!!
