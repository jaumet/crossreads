  
 41 soon alive with flags & just as the anchor dropped I ran up the gangway & shook hands with Eng Lt Cresswell, who quickly piloted me to Capt MacInnes. Major Martin followed in the Police boat. Shortly afterwards she came up to the ship. The visit of the Matunga was for two purposes, to bring stores for the garrison & to open negotiations on behalf of Burns Philp & Co for the export of copra & other native products. She brought 10 bags of mails for us containing letters & papers that have been wandering about the Pacific for the last two months. What a time we had; FdkWms Hafen Post Office had never seen the like. The sorting room was a mass of letters, papers & packages. We whipped off our coats & worked like Trojans, the perspiration pouring off us like water. Our usual Church Parade was forgotten; instead all hands turned to the unloading of the ship & the erstwhile quietude of our little town was rudely broken by the harsh but welcome rattle of the winches. The work continued till sunset and will start again first thing in the morning. The "Matunga" is to leave at 3 pm tomorrow for Alexis Hafen & the "Lili" will proceed thither the next day. I omitted to mention that while at Alexis Hafen I was visited by Vincenti Torres, the youngster whose father was maltreated by the Missioners some days ago. He brought his little brother, Alphonse, with him; he presented me with a large bunch of bananas, some cucumbers & a cake specially made for me by his mother. I don't know how it is but these youngsters do get a hold on me. Yesterday afternoon the Garrison held a water carnival. The principal events were 200 yds handicap (won by Bragg, H Co.) 75 yds Cigar Race (Wilmott H Co) Diving (McQueen E Co) & Swimming Dive (King, Naval Gd)
