<p>My dear Mr Garling</p>
<p>I received your letter of 25/7/15 just one month old. I am very glad to hear that you are well also Mrs. Garling and Pat, by the was I also received a letter from Pat which I will try and answer this mail.</p>
<p>Since I last wrote I have had a rather severe attack of dysentery, as a matter of fact I have still got it nearly 3 months of experiment of different doctors I am getting tired of it so I am going to ask for a Medical Board they must either send me back to duty or home it is no use hanging on any longer I might destroy my health for life.</p>
<p>I was twice in hospital, the first time</p>
