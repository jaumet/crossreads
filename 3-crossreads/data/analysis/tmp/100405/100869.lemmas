 La Madelon ( A Yanke translat ) Below the camp where mani soldier muster , There is an inn that they call the "porlus " [ ? ] rest , A modest hous , whose wall with ivi cluster Hard by the shelter wood , a cosi nest , The girl who wait on us is pleas Like sparkl wine her eye in fun She hard halt to hear our teas She 's onli known as Madelon . All through our dream at night all through our day 's dull chanc She 's onli Madelon perhap , but she 's Romanc . Chorus When Madelon come trip to our tabl We bold pluck her skirt as she goe by And each one whisper low his pretti fabl Made up to win her , on the sli . Our Madelon is not a sur beauti . So when we chuck her chin to lead her on She laugh ? that 's all ? and feel she 's done her duti . Madelon , Madelon , Madelon .
