The fourth division holds the reputation throughout the force as the most travelled Australian division about France.  It has fought in every field, with invariably the greatest distinction.  The third division, the newest of all, had never before fought outside Flanders, and came to the Somme country with the keenest enthusiasm.  Its battalions had long endured the friendly chaff of other divisions,  that they were not dinkum Anzacs, as they had never seen the Somme.  They had the honour of bestriding a ridge between the Somme and the Ancre in the direct path of the Germans, where they were sent in to battle individually as they dismounted from omnibuses, and flung themselves against the enemy advance guards.
On March 27 and 28 two brigades made a brilliant skirmishing advance south of Mericourt and drove in the enemy advanced lines.  Clearing a large portion of Treux Wood, they established a firm line running in the direction of Sailly, which they held against all attacks.  In this advance a Tasmanian battalion, made a particularly gallant fight.  The fourth came into action contemporaneously west of Albert, after a magnificent forced march already described.  One of its brigades went into action to support a tired British division.  This brigade, like the other two west of Albert, met heavier fighting than the third division, especially at Albert, where it was called upon to withstand heavy German massed assaults, especially in the great battle of Dernancourt on April 5, when, after an all-day fight, they threw back the storming German divisions.
April 4 and 5 were days which will long live in the history of Australian arms - the days when the Germans tried their utmost, with what forces remained with them, to hack a way through to Amiens.  On April 4 efforts were made south of the Somme against Villers and Vretonneux, when the British cavalry and New South Wales battalions fought tooth and nail an heroic battle against odds.  The flanks were consistently hard pressed, and the town itself, the centre of their position, was deluged with shell fire.  Nevertheless, giving ground only by inches, and repeatedly counter-attacking, they finally saved the position, after 18 hours fighting.
