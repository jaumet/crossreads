This I lodged (with an application for transfer to the firing line) to Capt Parker, who as much as refused, but this time I am determined to see the thing through &amp; I'll get to the front this time or go back home. Have had enough half &amp; half business   The usual [droll?] monotony of casualties until 12.30 pm &amp; we have the afternoon off duty. Take a long walk out of the other side of the city to that which we have traversed lately. Many hospitals &amp;  general depot camps here from which the troops proceed to the front. No 1 Aust General Hospital. No 6  &amp; 10 General (English) Hospitals. All in large marquee tents. Several convalescent hospitals also Indian hospital &amp; camp.</p>
