 replacement of one Gun-faattery by one Howitzer-battery and some renumbering of batteries. The Brigade's training was completed in December 1916. Then on 31 December 1916 the Brigade disembarked at Le Havre in France. Its 25 Battery was at this time comanded by Major J.B.W. James. In January 1917 the 7th Brigade, A.F.A. was again re-orgairiised. The four gun batteries were expanded to six gun batteries including one howitzer battery.

Godley's llnd Australian Corps was to be disbanded and its 3rd Australian Division was to be transferred to Birdwood&acute;s 1st Anzac Corps. Concurrently, the 1st Anzac Corps was to be re-organised into the Australian
