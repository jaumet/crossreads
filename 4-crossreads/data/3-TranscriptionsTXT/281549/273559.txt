All my family came to see me off with the exception of Dad & Alma. Dad had a carbuncle on the back of his neck & Alma stayed home with him. When I left Dad did not seem to be very bad, but later on the carbuncle got more serious and ultimately it led to his death on October the 30th 1916
Etta Lewin & Sisters also came to see me off, Miss Lily Finigan & a few of the Old Army Service Boys came as well. Prior to my Embarkation I was presented with a Silver Cigarette case & a Gillete Safety razor by the Boys at the Army Service Corps at Darlinghurst of which I had been a member prior to my enlistment.
Dad presented me with a wristlet watch & Etta gave me a pocket wallet. I received other presents from several different People.
