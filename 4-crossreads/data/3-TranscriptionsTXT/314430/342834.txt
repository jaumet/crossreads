I was carried out on an ammunition limber, which rumbled slowly through a dark field en route to La Heussoye Lahoussoye. On the way up I saw &amp; heard evidences of Hun 'plane busy bombing our battery positions. The Hun used to drop abrilliant flares from his machine; these would fall half way to earth, and then became as fixed balls of light, and burned on hung in the air for a quarter of an hour, thus illuminating a large area of the country beneath. I was jolted severely in the limber, which approached the outskirts of La H Lahoussoye about 10. PM, and the first thing I saw, on entering the village, was a huge iron crucifix that loomed up strangely in the darkness. On arrival I was put into a barn and fell asleep on the straw where until I was disturbed by a Hun plane dropping bombs on the village. The explosions made the night hideous, &amp; kept frequently cast lumps of dirt and debris upon the roof of the barn my shelter. On the 16th inst I was sent on to the hospital where I made am at this date.
