<p>The noise of men loading horses &amp; stores and wagons rumbling along the hard road and the horses being restless and the cold wind blowing. It was a night to be remembered. However the longest night must have a dawning &amp; so with this one. Daylight came at last and soon after an empty train came in from Cairo and then for the space of about one solid hour All hands set to work and loaded all the horses and got our stores on board. I was glad to get into a carriage where I could take of some of the equipment which is always a great weight and terribly inconvenient at all times. Imagine a bandolier of 90 rounds of ball ammunition which in itself weighs about 20lbs. A water bottle full of water, a waist belt with bayonet and 4 pouches containing 60 rounds, a pair of field glasses and a prismatic Compass. All these things fit tight and it is a relief to get them off I always get pains in the Shoulders through having my equipment on too long. However we got into a carriage at last and about 7.30 AM. we moved off and for several hours there was a complete blank in my existance</p>
