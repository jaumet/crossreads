all helped to make a Beautiful Picture. These small Glass Houses were very nicely laid out inside, they are all on Graves some have two chairs inside some beautiful Wreaths of Beads of various colours designs also several contained the Photo of the Deceased Person buried underneath. I spent an enjoyable hour wandering about, at the top I came across several rows of French British soldiers Graves who had died in the Hospital in the Town, the graves are well looked after. I saw two soldiers digging around them trimming them up. I then went along came down the other side eventually came to the entrance went back over the Canal up into the Town being well satisfied with my Visit. I was soon directed to the YMCA Hut there had a cup of cocoa had my lunch a rest for  an hour then walked quietly back to the station arriving there at 1.15 Pm at 1.37 we were off again for Bethune. At each station there were an unusual number of civilians Soldiers travelling, it being Sunday. Coming down we passed a Semaphore Signal at Danger by an order of the Chief Guard as a Train was in the Section ahead we had to proceed cautiously to the next Semaphore which also was at danger on another order we continued on slowly on taking a curve we could see the Train
