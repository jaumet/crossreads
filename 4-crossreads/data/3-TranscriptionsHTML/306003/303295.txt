<p>21.3.16<br/>Tue 21st<br/>Went to the sand hill again today &amp; had some good practice with the helio.  but Major Smith sent a man out to tell us to come in at 2 oclock, when we arrived back in camp I found there was a message saying I had to give signalling instruction to the troops (6 men at a atime) &amp; there was no necessity to keep the helio station going all day while the 'phone was working.  so it appears our Helio Station is being cut out;</p>
<p>We had no natives troubling us today apparently they took Reidy's lesson to heart yesterday  Mick O'Donnell was up before the Col today &amp; received 4 days No 2 Field punishment for being in the village with the others a few nights ago, none of the others were punished but as Mick is an old offender they gave it to him;  Received tunic today</p>
