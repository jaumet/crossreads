 Monday we have to be on parade at 7.30 AM. &amp; we are to be inspected by General Godly;  next   We have to be in full marching order &amp; have everything the same as though we were going to move off for the front;  Idleboy's leg is still bad I hope to have him fit by Monday morning; Nelson has gone to Cairo this afternoon &amp; Stan has gone to Heliopolis since tea, so I am putting the evening in writing.
