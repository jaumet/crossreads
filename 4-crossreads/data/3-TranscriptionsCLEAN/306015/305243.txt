  
 July 5.   Reveille at 5.50, breakfast at 6.   Our platoon then went through a 'stunt' with ball ammunition & moving targets.   After dinner 80 of us moved off and marched to Martin Puich.   This village is about 3 miles past Pozieres & is a total wreck, being literally razed to the ground.   The fighting was very severe in this quarter as can easily be detected.   Dud shells lie everywhere, and bombs of every description, both British & German, are as common as stones.    We came upon one huge unexploded shell on the side of a dug-out.   It was 15" in diameter and about 4' 6" long and every time I pass it I feel somewhat awe-stricken. 
 Our quarters here would remind one very much of a ranch.   We live in tin huts, dug-outs or anything else we can
