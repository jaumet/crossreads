 My dear Mother I got your letter (Saturday 3 p.m. just befor leaving camp and I received Fathers on Thursday.  I have just come down from camp and have not had any dinner yet so can only write you a line. Of course sell Gaida if you think you can get a good price for her, but I dont think they will buy her for the military as all our horses are ponies like Galina. Next week 150 horses are coming up to camp and we are going to start mounted drill.  I am glad you got the rain, wonder what the sheep brought? The boys wrote saying that the proofs of my photo had & I need not be afraid of showing them to people as I looked quite hansome which showed how much they are faked.  Cheeky little devils. It is raining slightly here & I am hungry. With love from Rob
