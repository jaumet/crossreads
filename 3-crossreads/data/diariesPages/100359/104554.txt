The crowd went for a route march to night with full packs up, but I know one man who went out with an air cushion in his pack. S.P. were excused, so the game is still good. 
Tuesday 30th 
Another busy day in the incinerator, also digging holes to bury what wont burn, a nigger came along and was very anxious to dig the hole, so, as we did not like to spoil a good mind, we let him. The tucker we are getting is rotten, Our Corp.Cook was at Alexandria for about 6 weeks at a Cookery School, but instead of improving he has got a jolly sight worse. This is a rotten camp, we are in, but thank the Lord we'll soon be out of it, at least we are hoping so. The crowd went for another route march with full packs. The orderly room sergeant informed us that they were open to receive letters again, which is a jolly good job, as we all like letting folks at home know how we are. Went to Y.M.C.A. where a first class programme was gone through by the New Zealanders from the stationary Hospital, who are leaving for France about the same time as we hope to. This afternoon I went for a stroll as far as Nefiche station. It appeared deserted but for a few Arabs who were lying about asleep. As soon as a train was heard it became quite exciting. Arabs old and young "Bints" and "Walads" appeared from "Nowhere" and every one had something for sale,, cigarettes, chocolates, melons, cucumber etc. etc., "Cigaretts very good", "very nice" "very clean "Water Melon, Johnnie" They were singing out and made a regular pandemonium. They are a very dirty crowd and spend most of these time hunting "big game" Things must be pretty bad with "em about these parts, as they dug a deep hole for us just to let ?em take away the scraps of food.
