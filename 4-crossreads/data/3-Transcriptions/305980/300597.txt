<p>July</p>
<p>1: Enemy raided our outpost, but was beaten off with grenades, leaving two dead in front of the post.</p>
<p>3:  Our camps have been heavily shelled during the past week, but we have good cover &amp; little damage has been done, except for the horses when at the troughs.</p>
<p>4:  Back to Malaria post ( Maskareh) at 8 p.m., lost two men sick &ndash; doing duty with only three on each gun.</p>
<p>7:  Except for continuous shelling by either force, day &amp; night, nothing startling has occurred of late.  We cannot move from our bivouacs during the day, as we always receive a good supply of shells if moving about &amp; rocks fly every where.</p>
<p>11:  Murray killed &amp; Bradley wounded  by a 5.9 shell, which exploded just at the opening of their bivvy.  This occurred at 5 a.m. just as we came off post.  Buried Murray in cemetery behind Musselabah, having to carry his body about 3 miles from our post.  Impressive burial at 9 p.m. about 40 all ranks present.</p>
