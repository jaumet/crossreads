Fine & cold. We went out on a brigade stunt in the morning & did not get back till about 2 pm. We went over the downs & came into action a couple of times. We took the waggons down to ordinance stores at Fargo & got 320 odd rounds of amunition for firing tomorrow. I was on horse picket at night. Got a letter from Linda & it was just the letter I had been looking for for a long time.
