<p>We were also issued with air-tight goggles and went through tear-gas,(sometimes called pineapple gas owing to its likeness in odour)through an open trench. There was a Y.M.C.A. hut at the end of our row of tents, and we used to spend most of our leisure time there at the fire as it was bitterly cold outdoors. We visited the town of Etaples on two occasions, and generally speaking it was a filthy town, giving off some very nasty odour especially in the narrow streets. The people have no modesty apparently, as post cards and pictures are displayed in windows that would shock any ordinary person's modesty in Australia or England.</p>
<p>It was now the beginning of November, and we moved off to the railway siding to embark into trucks for Albert, which is one of the headquarters on the Somme front. I shall never forget the journey which lasted from 6 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock the same evening. As we drew up near Albert in the train we could hear the rumbling of the heavy guns in the distance, and we all sat reserved, talking little, but thinking a good deal.

At the top of the tower is a bronze monument of the Virgin Mary with a baby in her arms overhanging the street. This monument was considered unsafe in this position, so the engineers went up and fastened it securely in the same overhanging attitude. We stayed in Albert overnight, spending a very cold night, and marched next day to Dernancourt, where we joined our unit, the 21st Battalion. We spent 5 days in this village of Dernancourt, which was a low lying muddy and uncomfortable place, doing drill and getting organised for the Battalions next turn in the trenches. Our accommodation there was of a very rough and crowded nature, as we were lining in stables, cowsheds or pigsties, and some men were even in cart sheds which were fairly open to the snow floating in on them whenever</p>
