La Madelon (A Yankee translation)
Below the camp where many soldiers muster,
There is an inn that they call the "porlus" rest,
A modest house, whose walls with ivy cluster
Hard by the sheltering woods, a cosy nest,
The girl who waits on us is pleasing
Like sparkling wine her eyes in fun
She hardly halts to hear our teasing
She's only known as Madelon.
All through our dreams at night all through our day's dull chance
She's only Madelon perhaps, but she's Romance.
Chorus
When Madelon comes tripping to our table
We boldly pluck her skirt as she goes by
And each one whispers low his pretty fable
Made up to win her, on the sly.
Our Madelon is not a surly beauty.
So when we chuck her chin to lead her on
She laughs ? that's all ? and feels she's done her duty.
Madelon, Madelon, Madelon.
