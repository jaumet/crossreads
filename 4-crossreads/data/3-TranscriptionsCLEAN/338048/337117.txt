There are Australian soldiers in plenty about the streets and the people generally & very nice. It is amusing to see the women some quite middle aged running after buses & getting on while it is going. There is a bustle getting on & off the bus but along the streets all is ordinary. The narrow streets are marvellously navigated by hosts of motor buses & taxies and the way they dodge each other about is marvellous.

Nothing like the Age which is very often quoted by the most important papers here. I will post you some when something Australian is mentioned. All our chaps are very patriotic. No place whatever like Australia which we boom to all the people with which we come in contact.
