  
 30/8/17 Campagne and Renescure   Went over to Renescure at 10am and sat with General Wisdom & 4 Colonels on a G.C.M trying a Captain of the Provost Corps.  Some of the M.P witnesses were terrible people - fat & cold footed perjurers.  Had lunch at 7th BHQ in an old fashioned castle like place with a moat round it.  A date 1472 over the door but the whole place shows signs of very much rebuilding and renovation.  Lots of little turrets & towers.  Mullioned windows.  Our Court sat in an old meeting room elsewhere & on the walls were photos of past Republic presidents and a plaque of war of the female figment symbolical of "Republique Francaises".  After dinner corrected a number of maps sent in by the Intelligence officer & done by our privates.  The regimental buglers played a very fine 'Last Post"at 10 p.m.  Am anxiously awaiting word of my application for Italian leave and do hope it soon arrives.  Harricks leaves for the 6th I.B. in a few days for 6 months.
