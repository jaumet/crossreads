Dear old Vol
I received your letter of Nov. 10 today, and can assure you that I was very pleased to hear, as I was beginning to realise your letters were becoming rarer and further between.  I've written so many that I have long since been prepared to lose one in every two, because not many get to their destination.  It's the same with mails coming over here.
I got a letter or two from George, as I told you in my last.  I think he is still in England;  he owes me a letter which I expect to get shortly, unless he's joined his unit, in which event he would probably not write but try to look me up.  I intend doing the same
