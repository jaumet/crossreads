<p>My dearest Mother</p>
<p>Theres a little song which is a great favourite with the boys here, it goes<br/>My home in Tennersee,<br/>Just try &amp; picture me,<br/>Right on my mother's knee,<br/>She thinks the world of me.<br/>All I can think of to night,<br/><strike>Are</strike> Is the fields of snowy white,<br/>Banjos ringing, darkies singing,<br/>All the world seems bright.<br/>Red roses round the door,<br/>Make me love mother more,<br/>I'll see my sweetheart Flo,<br/>And friends I used to know,<br/>They'll be right there to greet me,<br/>Just imagine how they'll greet me,<br/>When I get back, when I get back,<br/>To my home in Tennersee!</p>
<p>Well, the first time I heard that song</p>
