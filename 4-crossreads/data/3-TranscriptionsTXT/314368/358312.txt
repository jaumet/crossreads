 on board is the Y.M.C.A. This association supplies us with reading and if needed writing matter and materials. 
 I do a good deal of reading, looking at the ocean is interesting for a while, but a chap soon gets tired of it. I have seen very little animal life since coming on board, with the exeption of a few flying fish have seen no denizens of the sea, of any kind.  News to a certain extent is restricted, as everything passes through the censors hands so I shall wait till later to send you along a longer letter Ida, I may not write this time to the boys so you can let them know how I am when you write. My permanent address will be. Pte. G.T.E- No 1647 2nd Rfts.  54 Battn Intermediate Base. Depot. Egypt. All letters sent to this address will be forwarded on to me. 
 Hoping you are all well at  home With fond love. Your Loving Brother Gordon
