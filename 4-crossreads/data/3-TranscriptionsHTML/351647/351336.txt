<p>I have the blanket bag your mother gave me on leaving.  I've used it constantly ever since &amp; haven't washed it yet.  What ho.</p>
<p>How is the winter going at Tog.  How is Mac &amp; is he still the sweet tempered light hearted blithe lad.  Also I hope Graham is well.  I'm just dying to see him.</p>
<p>The Boss well &amp; cheerful I hope also Tom Fog &amp; whats my successor doing.  Do write soon &amp; tell me everything about the garden &amp; the personnel &amp; your latest dresses.  How is the new Jackeroo &amp; who you've had staying there.  I've not heard anything of your book.  Don't say you have dropped it.</p>
<p>I must fly &amp; post this.  My love to all &amp; specially yourself.</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Jim Wilks</p>
