<p>Tuesday 9th May</p>
<p>Had a letter form Rita today &amp; it has cheered me up wonderfully.<br/>Scrimgeour tonight promised to give me a recommendation when I leave, but no news of the result of the applications I put in a few days ago.<br/>Am progressing slowly with the Latin.<br/>Have come to the conclusion after a great deal of thought on the subject of late, that if I get back safely it will be urgently necessary for me to strike out in some new line &amp; specialise in order to progress a little more quickly than I did.<br/>A little more application &amp; diligence</p>
