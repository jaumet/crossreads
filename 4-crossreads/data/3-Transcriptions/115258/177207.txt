<p>Our &#39;Arbour</p>
<p>20/4/19</p>
<p>Easter Evening</p>
<p>Just eating a buttered bun Aunt Katie sent me.</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>been in the &#39;Arbour for nearly three days now. Anchored near Watsons bay, and tomorrow we go to North Head for Quarantine till Anzac day; when we are to march (or &quot;drift&quot; I expect it will be) in the precession. We are a &#39;clean ship&quot; so dont know why we are being kept in, but it seems to be the usual thing. I received yours &amp; Fathers letters of 17th April. Sorry to hear it is still so dry, but glad you are not coming</p>
