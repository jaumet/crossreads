<p>We are now on Board Ship and the Distance from here to Gallipoli is 60 miles. We will reach there Some time tonight and join up with our Battalion tomorrow morning&nbsp; We were all on Ship yesterday and at the last moment we were told to get back to the Minnewaska&nbsp; the weather was to rough to land us at Anzac. we may not get away to day. But there is a Slight Chance of Doing So Soon. any how I hope that we reach there tonight. So that I will See Some of my old pals again.</p>
