  
 11 February 1918 Monday We are in Reserve the weather cleared with a terrific thunderstorm- Out all day with Capt McLean surveying well known towns & districts like Lud once Lydda, Ramleh, etc. Afternoon held long postponed Sports  as  I have 2 boils under one arm & one under the other.  I was only an administrator.  The Rain washed away railway in the WADIS so no letter from the little wife for several days-  From where we were working SNOW plainly visible on the hills towards SAMARIA   Crusaders Towers are good landmarks in our surveying work- which was originally done by  HH  KITCHENER 1878
