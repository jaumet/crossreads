My dear Harry
Thank you dearie, for your nice kind letter, you know Harry boy, you are so very thoughtful, that alone, would endear you to me, but when you came to see us, strangers to one another, you boys walked straight into our hearts and there you will for ever remain, "the boys" are spoken of every day in this house, and our friends know you all by name, your beautiful album is often looked at, and much admired, in fact, Harry boy, your Uncle says, "you might be really my own boys," at which I say, "so they are," and so you are This is always your home, on this side of the Globe, at any rate, and we are longing so very, very much to see your dear faces again.
You will smile, when I tell you, that I am quite jealous when I hear of others having you, but Ellis is a dear lad too, and told me, in his last letter, that he would rather Summer Hill and that, pleased me much, I don't
