April & May 1917
was the ruins of a big French Chateau which had been destroyed by the huns. Next morning we moved further back to Reincourt Camp which is situated midway between the villages of Reincourt & Beaulencourt. Our stay did not last very long for the following night 26th we marched to a sunken road outside Veaux to releive the 18th Battalion who were to practice a stunt & the same battalion releived us early next morning & we moved back to Reincourt Camp again. We stayed a couple of days here this time but on the 29th we again moved back to Veaux & releived the 18th Battalion & this time I was put in charge of an out post & it was about 4,000 yards behind the line. From this post we could see the artillery limbers & battalion transports taking ammunition & rations forward under observation of the enemy who used to shell them very heavy. Our next move came during the afternoon of May 2nd when we were releived by the Battalion & when we moved back to Company H Qtrs. I was detailed to report back at Reincourt Camp. The same night the 2nd Division were having a big stunt & our battalion was to move into close supports for same.
