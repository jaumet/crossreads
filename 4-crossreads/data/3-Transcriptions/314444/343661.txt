<p>top. The last few days the have been bringing it up as quick as possible &amp; we have about seven days supplies on top. Well all these things have to be contended with and I am one that will stand them. I am sure &amp; feel certain that I am coming back without a scratch. I have got ever so much more used to the life that is the buzzing of bullets &amp; shrapnel &amp; the big guns going off.<br/>I am very sorry to hear about Arthur having trouble with the Natives. Now mother Dear do not worry and believe in fate as I do. I would be very pleased if a lot of our chaps believed in it One thing I have the name from Officers &amp; most in the company of being the coolest &amp; gamest in the company.<br/>I am sorry to say we lost Johnson one of our tent mates at Liverpool He was that quite chap I told you about He was shot through the head right alongside me It was bad luck. Old Mackay is wounded.<br/>Will write again soon  hoping you are all well Give my regards to all friends &amp; Love to Helen.<br/>With all my love<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
<p>I tip it to last about another 6 to 8 weeks here &amp; then good bye Turkey</p>
