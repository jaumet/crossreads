<p>arriving at foothills in afternoon where we camped preparatory to taking up position in the line. Taubes visited us &amp; we were also shelled while watering. Once more we are back in the old Jordan Valley. Where we are there is no shelter so expect Jacko will give us hell<br/>Thursday Aug 22<br/>Contrary to expectations things were quiet to day &amp; about 8 pm we took over from 3RD LH.FA The position we are at present occupying is one of the worst in the valley. We are some 3 miles from Water camped between two hills. Going to water is like taking a ticket</p>
