<p>Via San Francisco</p>
<p>July 27 1875</p>
<p>My dear Arthur<br/>I dare say you have thought the one hundred and Fifty pounds I promised you some time ago, a long time in putting in its appearance. However it only makes good the old saw &amp; "better late than never".</p>
<p>I had hoped to have heard from my Brother respecting the matter, but cannot allow you to wait any longer, I have not heard from him for a very long time. My firm had a letter from him a couple of months ago about some wines he had in Sydney belonging to us, which he has now sent home and which have safely arrived &ndash;</p>
<p>The &pound;150 is for you to do, just what you like with. I shall send this letter open to your Mother that she may peruse the cash. I having had the Bill made out in her name, in case you might be absent from Sydney akin this arrives</p>
<p>Wishing you every success in business and with Love to your Brothers &amp; Sisters believe me my dear Arthur</p>
<p>Your ever eff. Uncle<br/>John S. Hall</p>
<p>(all well at Bondican House)</p>
