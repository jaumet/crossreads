I hope this is the last time that I will have to send for money.  The allowance here for a private is 3/6 per diem.  As things are at present it is impossible to get meals in England under 1/-, which only leaves 6d. per night for a bed.  However I am just cutting things out nicely.  I am very comfortable where I am &amp; I am getting all my meals over at the A.I.F. War Chest Club, which is right opposite headquarters.<br/>It is still miserable weather over here, but not nearly as cold as it was down Perham Downs way.  It is not all office work that I am doing at present; I often have a lot of running round different parts of London after drugs of one kind &amp; another and am quite able to find my way round the Metropolis.<br/>I am very glad to be able to say that I am feeling wonderfully well lately; just after I came here, I was feeling very sore in the side, &amp; I got Capt. Shaw to give me an overhaul.  He did so &amp; said that I had given the side a bit of a strain, and that I would have to take it easy for a time.  Among my transfer papers was a memo. from the S.M.O. (Senior Medical Officer) at Wareham in answer to a question by Major Buchanan, saying, "This man's classification is B2 A." instead of B1 A4. as I thought.<br/>I can't help being struck with the way in which the women are working to defeat the Huns.  I saw one yesterday, a little way out</p>
