January, 1917. 1st after Epiphany. Sunday 7Set out about 9 and was surprised at the daylight appearance and no of dead all along especially outside Delville and surrounding the tank into which I looked. No guns left. Also deep dugouts in german old lines. Surveyed Nos 10 to 15. 10 being near Grandecourt. Here was some of the 18 pounder batteries. Day was fine and frosty a little misty and a M.G. was located in Needle Trench to deal with low flying planes used once but at long range. Tanks are scattered frequently. Fair amount of shelling and shrapnel landed rather close. Returned about 2.30 and after tea wrote letters. Savage gone to School of instruction and Kernot to follow.
