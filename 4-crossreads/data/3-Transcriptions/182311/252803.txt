<p>The wonderful monuments &amp; Arches, Admiralty Arch, Marble Arch, the monument, Trafalgar Square with its Lions, its tall column surmounted by Nelsons Statue. The effigies of Statesmen &amp; Soldier in all the parks &amp; reserves were productive of great satisfaction but also the picture galleries were closed &amp; their valuable pictures, their &quot;Moner Elizas&quot; were safe in underground vaults quite away from possible damage by Zeppelin<s>s</s> bombs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; London by night is a city of darkness, streets lamps are shaded, all blinds are drawn, lights on vehicles are reduced to the smallest possible glare, &amp; even <sub>^</sub><sup>the</sup> trains have all blinds drawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night when I left London &#39;twas enveloped in a real London fog, this further emphasised the effect of the reduced lighting &amp; one had to cross roads, feeling the way from island to island &amp; chancing accidents, small boys with lanterns were everywhere earning coppers, but their value lay not in the light they carried but in their knowledge of the locality.</p>
