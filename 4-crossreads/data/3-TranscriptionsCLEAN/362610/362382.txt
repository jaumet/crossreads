Thursday 15 June 1916Not on duty during the night & so had a really good sleep from 10 p.m. until 3 a.m. things being very quiet right through. In accordance with the daylight saving scheme the time was put forward to 12 midnight at 11 p.m. The day turned out to be very dull only a slight drizzle of rain falling. Trotting round & doing odd little hobs, having an hour's sleep as well. The wind was very cold from the NW & the day altogether quite wintry.In the afternoon Rid came along about 4 o'clock & stayed for a couple of hours. He had rather a nasty cough but promised to get some stuff for it next day. It was quite a treat to see him.
