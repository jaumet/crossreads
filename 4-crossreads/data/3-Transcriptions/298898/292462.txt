<p>Sunday 4th <strike>Feb.</strike><br/>The cold winds appeared to have started as today was cold &amp; windy. Things very quiet in the line except for shelling, a pretty stiff lot being thrown over on our right. Planes fairly lively two huns &amp; one of ours being brought down.</p>
<p>Monday 5th <strike>Feb.</strike><br/>Heavy fall of snow last night everything being covered this morning. Had about 15 cases in during the night all from one battery. They had just moved into position at Flers when Fritz located them &amp; put over 200 heavies toute de suite playing up the very deuce. A dugout 30 ft. deep was destroyed burying the men inside, a tribute to the power of heavy guns &amp; an anti-aircraft gun also got knocked rotten. One of our machines took on &amp; brought down two huns during the day</p>
