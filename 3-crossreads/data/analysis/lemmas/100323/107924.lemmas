Reid the elder Chief Officer is a charact and there is also a pilot aboard . The ship began to look a bit more trim by noon and was inspect by the Admiralti surveyor and other . Afternoon I went up the town and did some shop . Hull had a half holiday today and the citi was deader than ever . A slummi place and wretch type of peopl . Go to sea build up their bodi a bit and make up for wretch hous . A good deal of eat to do here but the sea air and smell of wet paint send up one appetit . Other ship with lesser crew are alongsid .
