<p>1st Anzac Corps, 9th July, 1917.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear Travers,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your letter of the 7th July, which I quite understand, and which you may be sure I will keep in mind. More than that you will know it is impossible to say, while I am sure you know how sincerely I trust that you and Basil Holmes may see through the war in safety. I can personally much sympathise with you about the small son in Australia, for much the same occurred to me during the South African war, when I was away from home for three years, just as a small child appeared.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
