1st January.1917.
Came out of the line last night to reserves in "Gap Trench." The shelters here are rough affairs; not rain proof. Some mail was sent up to us. Rested all day except for a few odd carring jobs.

Went to work on the "Anzac Tunnel"; which is being constructed in the communication tunnel with the supports of the Geudecourt sector. It is over a mile long and is 30 feet underground. A light railway is being constructed so that the wounded can be brought through it. The 1st Pioneer Battalion takes the credit of this work. "Hinie" has our duckboard track that leads to the line so well marked that he punks holes in it till it looks like a section of a cribbage Board.
