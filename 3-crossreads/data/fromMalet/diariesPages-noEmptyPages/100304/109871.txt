Glasgow. a great day. Pottered round all the morning and at 2pm went up to the Windsor Hotel to Skene's wedding. There were a good many guests and everything went off like clockwork. It was a homely little wedding and afterwards 'the younger ones" adjourned to the Central for tea and afterwards went to the Ahlambra music hall until 9 o'clock. Skene's sister in law tres bon and also a little first year med girl. Spent a grand evening with them and really have never listened to anything so pretty as their Scotch accent. They twit us about our Cockney one. Out to Newlands for supper and some music and it was grand to get with a family again. All so homely and so Scotch. Bed 12 mid.
