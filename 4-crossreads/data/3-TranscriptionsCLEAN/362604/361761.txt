They are both well & Jack has not even been wounded yet.  We are getting cold weather now.  Ern has 5 blankets & sheets & Ellis & Dick 6 & 7.  I only have 3 so far & I am lovely & warm.  Now, my Dear ones, I've no more news.  The mail has not come for 3 weeks now, but I had a stray one from my Friend at Inverell so I guess there will be heaps along To-morrow
