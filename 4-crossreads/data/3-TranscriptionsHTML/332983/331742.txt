<p>have at Battery 1,008 rounds of ammunition, Without doubt the Turks are great fighters. Of course they have had months to prepare for this, Bombardment eased at 7 P.M. Warships firing on Krithea village Turks running. 260 prisoners captured this morning and 200 this evening and 2 German officers all elderly men, seemed greatly fatigued, There are 84 in a yard not 200 yards from our lines. Some 4.7 shells in our lines today. Still another narrow escape one fell 6 yards from me, most awful noise, no damage done, 2 men in 1st Battery wounded. The farrier of 3rd Bty had a narrow escape, just missed him by a hairs breath, knocked over 3 men, no one hurt, not even a scratch  It is bad on our side, but it must be fair hell on the Turks. The Scottish in the firing line today. Our side suffered heavly 304 rounds sent to Battery tonight, waiting to draw. Drew 1,308 rounds today, one gun out of action, spring broken. Got one from the R.H.A. B.A.C.<br/>13/7/1915<br/>Tuesday. French firing away on right flank. Our Bty got only 250 rounds, cant get any</p>
