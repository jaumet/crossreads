<p>The C. of E. Chaplain, Capt. Hinsly, held a service followed by Holy Communion, at 10.30. It is Mother's Day, &amp; he gave a lovely sermon. The service was held in a beautiful spot in the forest, the tall green beech trees forming a canopy overhead. Wrote to Mother in afternoon, &amp; at 6 pm the 13th Brigade padre had a little service in the Y.M. barn. I got a parcel from Elsie today, a nice cake. We go back in the line tomorrow night, wonder what sort of a spin we'll have. Monday 13 May Before daybreak, I was aroused by our machine guns firing hard, &amp; could hear the drone of aeroplanes, &amp; knew Fritz was overhead. They dropped several bombs,  &amp; his guns also began shelling, &amp; I could hear the awful roar as the shells burst unpleasantly close to our pozzy. He knows our guns are about here. On getting up for breakfast, I saw one huge hole only 2 yards from the trench where two of our chaps were sleeping. Other holes were round about, &amp; the road was torn up in places. I slept most of the day, wasn't tired, but getting ready for tonight when we go back into the line. Unfortunately it rained all day &amp; will</p>
