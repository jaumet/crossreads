you can get any amount of them, but I expect this state of affairs won't last long.
29th. On the same job again today only the parties are all split up. We had a few anxious moments last night old Fritz dropped heavy shells all round us the clods fell like rain on our slender little humpy, we were expecting every shell to land right on us, but they knocked off in time. A man would be dead stiff to stop a shell right back here, but you never know when one will blot you out for he drops them at random day night they are likely to catch some one.
It rained a fair bit last night melted all the frozen ground, the consequence is, that today everything is soft muck once more, King mud reigns supreme.
