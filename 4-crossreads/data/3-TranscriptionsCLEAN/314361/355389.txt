  
 Raineville Nov. 9th 16 Left Ridemont yesterday midday, marched about four miles then boarded busses which took us about fifteen miles & dropped about 1 1/2 miles outside this one. Do not think much of this village, seems to be all barns, the houses are built behind the barns. As usual we had trouble over finding a billet, last night we found the one intended for us, but also found that A. Coy had jumped the claim, however we discovered another in a hay loft, we had all climbed up the ladder when Madame of the farmer came running out very excited trying to tell us that, that was not a billet & that we could not sleep there. We took no notice, so she took the ladder away. After a while one of the sigs, climbed down & found the billeting officer, explained the situation, & found us another place, this time on the ground floor. We are about seven miles from Amiens, but we are not allowed to enter that town. Sunday Nov. 12 16 Raineville Still in billet, the rain has kept off these last few days, & it is not quite so cold. Yesterday afternoon I had leave to visit Amiens.
