Thur June 13 (cont)
After Tea Tamblyn and I went to a whist drive at Arcadia. It is a very pleasant little Hall. There is a good dancing floor, and dances are held here during the week. As soon as we entered the Building some Lady (aged) asked me if I would be her partner, to which I acquiesced. She was a very good player, but we held rotten cards and did not manage to get a prize.
After the show my partner asked me if I would care to have a cup of coffee before I went back to Camp. I said I would and she took me Home and gave me two cups of coffee and some Bread and real butter and cheese. It doesn't do to say "No" to a Feed nowadays.
