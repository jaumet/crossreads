Had General Robertson along for a yarn after lunch and then James looked in. It was dark when we walked down to James' billet. The streets were crowded – a cinema show was thronged and the oldest profession in the world was having a busy time. Saw Beith of the 23rd and then walked up to the 22nd where I had dinner. The woman question is rather acute here and a great deal of VD is about. The Huns left all diseased women behind and our preventitives will be sure of a good sale. Round the fire at Bde H.Q. we talked about old battles all the evening. As a mob near the picture show seemed rather unruly I ordered an officers piquet to be on duty there tomorrow night.
