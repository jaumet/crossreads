<p>ships company, for breakfast we have porridge &amp; stew sometimes we have fried steak &amp; coffee, for dinner soup, roast meat &amp; vegetable &amp; sometimes pudding, for tea bread &amp; butter &amp; jam, sometimes stewed fruit, so you see we are living a bit better than we did in camp. Once a week we get an issue of fruit (apples) 2 each.</p>
