<p>20-3-15. 8.15 p.m.  We have read during the afternoon of the disaster to the British &amp; French warships, from contact with mines, while they were trying to force the passage of the Dardanelles.  It is not to be expected that in such project the attacking ships could escape unscathed.

I shall do so in the course of a few days.</p>
<p>21-3-15. 9 a.m.  Six of our Captains are this morning detailed for duty on a transport, each to one ship to go to where &hellip; Where?
