<p>will bring up the old joke about an army moving on its stomach, we</p>
<p>at last wriggle into No.5 post.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Good night, Sir&quot;, says the</p>
<p>Sergeant.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A lovely night for a harbour picnic&quot;:&nbsp; &quot;and a lovely</p>
<p>night for a sniper&quot; adds my Corporal with feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There is one</p>
<p>sniper who appears to be only about 50 yards out from here&quot;, says</p>
<p>the Sergeant.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I&#39;ve swept all the ground round about there with</p>
<p>the Lewis Gun but I fancy he must be in a shell hole and just</p>
<p>sticks his head up to fire&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well get your rifle grenades ready,</p>
<p>keep a careful watch out to locate his flash next time he fires</p>
<p>and then pour a couple of dozen grenades into the spot&quot;.&nbsp; (On a</p>
<p>night when the moon was not so troublesome, such a sniper would</p>
<p>easily be dealt with by two or three men wriggling out and</p>
<p>settling Mr. Sniper with hand grenades.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By now the enemy&#39;s artillery has opened up in</p>
<p>reply to the disturbance created down at xxxx Nos. 2 and 3 posts</p>
<p>and things are merry for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon our own artillery joins</p>
<p>in and the Boche quietens down again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our return journey to No.2 is just a repetition</p>
<p>of the outward trip, and here the relieving patrol should meet us.</p>
<p>We wait half an hour but as no sign of the patrol appears we set</p>
<p>off to look for them.&nbsp; No.1 reports that the patrol had been</p>
<p>there and left again an hour ago.&nbsp; Soon a messenger turns up and</p>
<p>tells us that the patrol corporal had been sniped through the</p>
<p>head between Nos.1 ad 2 and that the officer not having been over</p>
<p>the ground before had been compelled to return to Company Head</p>
<p>Quarters for a fresh guide.&nbsp; He turns up about half an hour</p>
<p>later and we are both held up in No.2 whilst Fritz puts about</p>
<p>50&nbsp; minewerfers (large trench mortar shells making a tremendous</p>
<p>noise in exploding and having great tearing effect) over.&nbsp;&nbsp; One</p>
