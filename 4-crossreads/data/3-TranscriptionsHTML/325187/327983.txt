Time will fix me up- but I'm bandaged so tight I can hardly breath <strike>in the rotten foul air below</strike><br/>Usual routine, Boat drill Dressings, Sleep, game of bridge, etc.<br/>Can only find 2 Australian Soldiers &amp; 1 new Zealander on board, they were glad to find someone who spoke <strike>"the Colonial twang"</strike> &amp; looked like a Convict, with close cropped HAIR</p>
