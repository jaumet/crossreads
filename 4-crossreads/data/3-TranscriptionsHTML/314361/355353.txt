<p>we are now in the north of France, did not pass through Paris. The flowers along the way have been glorious, have seen a great variety. We are now getting near the firing line. It is still lovely &amp; warm<br/>[indecipherable] July 3rd  16<br/>The journey finished about 3 Am this morning &amp; we are now in this village, which they say is about fifteen miles behind the firing line. We are billeted in a barn over a cottage. We are very comfortable, &amp; expect that we shall be here for a couple of weeks.<br/>July 3rd [indecipherable]<br/>It is quite a change to have cloudy days. Have just had a look over the village &amp; there is quite an elaborate church, elaborate in the inside. We hear a lot of booming from the front, but nothing comes our way.<br/>July 4th<br/>Have just had a thunderstorm the first rain we have seen for months. The thunder was exceptionally loud, similar to how we get it in Queensland. We are getting very well fed here, though what bread <strike>wh</strike> we have we have to buy, but expect to be issued with bread tomorrow</p>
