5/8/19 Durban
Hall and Municipal buildings are really fine and were all draped and decorated for the Peace celebrations. The shops and general lay out of this place beat Cape Town own out of sight. We went to the Royal Hotel near the main square and sat down for a while until S.M.O. Padre Fox came along. Dined with them at Hotel being waited on by coolie Hindu waiters. Processions sent us down towards to the beach again where were gay crowds, confetti and plenty of fireworks. Talk of a trip to Pietermaritzburg if the trains suit. We took a rickshaw back to the boat. Billy Hughes and Freidericsruh are here and the Durban Castle also. Bed 10.3.
