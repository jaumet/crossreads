<p>June 24<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to&nbsp;Fr&eacute;chencourt with supplies. we stay out at&nbsp;Fr&eacute;chencourt &amp; have a comfortable dinner &amp; go home at our leisure, when it is warm enough we stay awhile on the boulevardes of Amiens. we always spend some time in the flower &amp; fruit gardens &amp; parking out at Belloy-S.S. amongst the civilians we almost forget there is a war on &amp; we very much enjoy our privilages. not granted but taken nevertheless</p>
