<p>January, 1915.<br/>Thursday, 14<br/>Left Colombo at noon, a pretty Harbour &amp; sight all these big boats steaming out. A lot of trouble over men leaving the ship &amp; getting drunk.<br/>And many Rickshaws were broken out.<br/>I sent some Post Cards which I hope arrived safely &ndash; I bought some Mangos, PawPaws Bananas Green sweet oranges etc:- sufficient to see us to Aden.<br/>The Chief Officer got locked up in the civil gaol, &amp; several of our men fell off the Anchor Chain trying to get on board.</p>
