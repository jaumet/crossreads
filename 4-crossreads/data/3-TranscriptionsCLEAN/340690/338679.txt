9.4.18To move at 10 and set out not striking any villages and arriving at Flesselles at 12.  Visit to an estaminet and in afternoon got things more comfortable.  Parade at 3 and had to wash tool carts again.  However address to N.C.O's by Major and got away at 6.  In evening read a little and slept at 9.30 after demonstrations by Stott & Gillett.  Fine.  On exploder for 5 mins.
10.4.18Check parade at 7.30 and reveille at 7 but check parade didn't happen.  Breakfast 8 and drill order at 9.  Kernot made fools of us on exploder till 12 and Savage on 2 parade (drill order) continued till bout 4.  N.C.O's then packed tool cart till 5.30 and late again for tea.  Bed tired after reading some red book.
11.4.18Usual.  Fine.  No check parade and drill order at 9 and dismissed at 10 after usual tomfoolery by Kernot.  Then took 10 men to shift wagons at horse lines and eventually 4 horses used, back for dinner at 12.45.  In afternoon got boots fixed up to escape frightfulness.  Some still fooling with exploder and others with Kernot drilling.  News of capture of Messines, Sailly, Bac-St-Maur and we are standing to for entraining, presumably for there.
