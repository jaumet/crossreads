<p>Jan 26<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp; We stayed in bed late &amp; went without breakfast. We went through the Louvre art Galleries (Mus&eacute;e) in the afternoon &amp; in the evening we saw &quot;Faust&quot; at the Opera &nbsp;We had the worst seat in the house I believe right behind a big pillar. but as we went there more&nbsp;<s>for</s>&nbsp;to see the building &amp; effect than to follow the opera which we could&#39;nt understand, we had an enjoyable evening</p>

<p>Jan 27<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday - But the best times must come to an end &amp; I woke up in the morning to find this my last day in Paris - we got up late &amp; went without breakfast - we went to Bois de Boulogne in the afternoon the place of sunday crowds &amp; came back down the Avenue de champs Elyss&eacute;e &amp; had supper at&nbsp;C&eacute;cilles. we finished up on champagne &amp; I told them that I would be down in Paris again as soon as possible &amp; I would sure come &amp; see them - I caught 11.40 P.M. train from Gare du Nord after a splendid holiday which I was very sorry had finished so quickly, the Canadians who were on 14 days leave saw me off &amp; they remained as they had three more days still to go.</p>
