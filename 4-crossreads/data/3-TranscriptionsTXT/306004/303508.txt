3.9.16Sun 3rdThis morning R.S M. Mc Keown Sgt Laney & I rode to Mahomedia & caught the 9 oclock train to Port Said.  the line is only a small one & we dropped the sides of the truck & let our feet dangle within a few inches of the ground but as we were crossing some points about half way to Port Said one of the lads was pulled off but was not hurt & we continued our journey - after putting the sides of the trucks up, it was a rather rough journey as we were packed in as close as it was possible to get; the sea was within a few yards of us on out right all the way down & sand & salt lakes on our left. We arrived at Port Said after mid day & there was a rush for boats to get us across the Canal & we.
