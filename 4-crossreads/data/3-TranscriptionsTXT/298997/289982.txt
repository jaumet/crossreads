Dec 21.I discovered that there is one place in Kemmel where there are still civilians - a quaint little shop with vulgar, highly colored cards & an assortment of all sorts of foods.  Some diggers were knocking at the door, which was closed, and when I got near a woman opened it & said "Horsh! Horsh! you will wake the baby!"  Fancy waking the baby that seems undisturbed by the guns! - for there really is a baby there, it seems.  But fancy also civilians hanging on in the battered place!
Dec 23Have discovered three things.  Neuve Eglise, Dranoutre, and a man to play chess with me at the School of arts YMCA - Beebe, who was a member of the School of Arts, Sydney.  He belongs to another troop battalion.  Neuve Eglise is the headquarters of our 3rd Brigade, and is almost as badly smashed as Kemmel.  Taking a straight line between Neuve Eglise
