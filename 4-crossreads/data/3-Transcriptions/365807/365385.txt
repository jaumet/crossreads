<p>My dear Ferguson</p>
<p>I send you the enclosed, with which I wholly agree. Rennie will explain the parts you don't understand &ndash;</p>
<p>Thank God the boy is doing all right  looks well and is full of pluck &ndash; oddly enough I take his VOTE tomorrow as I'm returning officer for the Australians in all the Hospitals in the London command under Millbank!! &ndash;</p>
<p>Also  <u>I</u> think you Fergusons have done yr share and although yr boy begs to go back as soon as possible to the Front I propose doing my best to stop him and having him returned to Australia and when he gets there the Australians can then settle whether he is to be discharged or not &ndash; At this moment it is possible I may not start back till Sept. The War Office  through the AMP have asked for 2 or 3 months more of my services. I'll do what I'm told but everything is v difficult to know what is best. I am very</p>
