Also received a visit from Abbe'    [Duposs]   Ducants late of parish of Lille &ndash; Armentieres who had  been asked to call by friend Bucamp of [indecipherable]. Very nice of him. 
 Have had various letters from the unit &amp; hear that good boys have gone under since I left &ndash; you see I was the first, the very first casualty in action! Luckily for myself. 
 Mrs H. writes to let me know Chas. is waiting to rejoin his Batt. The cash comes in handy, am holding enough &amp; the rest will be used at  overstrand as I have directed for Xmas presents for Harold &amp; Charlie &amp; the youngsters. 
 Love from Harry.
