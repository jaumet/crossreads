camp after pitching the tents it was 11pm. Then to add to our tired feeling I was one of the unlucky ones to be put on piquet all night.The present camp site is right on the old famous battlefield of Tel-el-Kebir were Wolseley, Gordon & Kitchener scored the terminating victory over the tribes in 1882. There is a tremendous camp here far ahead of Liverpool in administration. It is well laid out and clean but the evil smell in the atmosphere is a contrast after the pleasant air at the Canal.
