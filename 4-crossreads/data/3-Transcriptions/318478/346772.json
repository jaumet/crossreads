<p>Dear Major Jarman</p>
<p>I am very interested in your scheme for presenting a picture of the Ghezira Cricket ground to Goseken and think the subject very suitable for "paint".</p>
<p>I hope to be in Cairo within 3 or 4 days from now and we could go into the matter in detail.</p>
<p>I certainly think that my present contract would not prohibit me from doing the job &amp; it is only a question of time which is getting short and of health which is not too good.  However I shall see you presently.</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
<p>Not undertaken.</p>
