  
 [Sunday 5 March 1916] 
  I got a Teapot from Laura & some Handkies- & more Woollen Soks-  It is quite hot now & about 102  today. Our horses are doing well but we have trouble to keep them shod, no coal in Egypt &  rotten iron in shoes- No fighting only patrol work but one never knows from day to day what our Desert friends are doing- [Following paragraph is crossed out] If anyone asks you what to send me as per Mrs W- a fountain pen would be most acceptable.  Posted notes to Deniliquin yesterday, but am glad you and Day are in Melbourne-   Regards to all friends
