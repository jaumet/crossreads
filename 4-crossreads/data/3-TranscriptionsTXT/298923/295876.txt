29 July 1918 Monday (Whole page crossed out)Tonight I am giving all A Squadron boys a bottle of wine each & the Officers a dinner on the strength of my D.S.O.  It is the men who do the work in these things & deserve the credit.  Just had a tragedy recited to me.   My groom had 7 days leave in Jerusalem to get married to a decent girl there.  Provost found him in their house over staying the night, he was arrested & the bride left "waiting at the Church"I shall marry them here in the Regiment, but all his clothes have been taken & he gets 21 days Field Punishment No. 2 pretty rotten luck.
