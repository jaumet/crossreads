<p>I shall tell you all about them when I come home.</p>
<p>Belle buy a few lively pieces of music such as "Destiny Waltz"   &amp;  a few popular songs. Cannot remember names just now but shall send a list next time.</p>
<p>Miss Cornwall came to see Pilkie this afternoon   &amp;  invited me to afternoon tea at Croydon tomorrow to see dear Col. Ramsay Webb (our old O.C. on Kyarra). He is going back to Australia, so she would like as many of his old sisters to say Bon Voyage.</p>
<p>Think I'm going on for ever. Must stop now. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all.</p>
<p>Love to my friends.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
