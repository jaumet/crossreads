<p>than Stretcher Bearing. We are still unattached to the 8th who are miles away in a comfortable billet. Two of our Officers who have been with us from the start have been promoted to Lieut. Colonels &amp; moved to another Ambulance. This is very unfortunate, we have lost two very good men. A German Plane flew over today &amp; dropped a bomb into our camp. One Officer was killed &amp; to men wounded. Another narrow escape for the 8th.</p>
<p>Thursday 16th November 1916.<br/>A bitterly cold morning, the ice was about an inch thick in the shell holes &amp; frost covered the ground. I have never experienced weather like this before. Working all day unloading wounded from the cars, &amp; different odd jobs. We all miss our Unit &amp; wish we were with them once again. Another Taube flew over today, a bomb was dropped &amp; 6 horses were killed, about 300 yards from our tent. A great rush of patients, during the night, some of the poor chaps have been lying wounded in the open for over two days. A great number of men die from exposure, the Stretcher Bearers cannot get to them.</p>
<p>Friday 17th November 16.<br/>The weather this morning was even worse than that of yesterday. It was bitterly cold &amp; my feet were like blocks of ice. What a miserable climate this is, &amp; only the beginning of the winter too. A great rush of patients all day. All kept busy.</p>
