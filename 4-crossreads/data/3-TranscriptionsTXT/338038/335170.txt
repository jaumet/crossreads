 My dear Father &amp; Mother. Many thanks for your long letters of 17th October received a few days ago, also Harold of 9th &ndash; That makes a break of a fortnight between the 2 last mails here; whether you posted anything by mail leaving Sydney 11/10/15 I don't know, but that mail was supposed to have foundered. The sheepskin vest has not turned up so far, but I know the 1st Brigade have not received their first instalment of comforts yet, so no doubt it will be along any time now. The last mail also brought me letters from Mrs Forsyth and Aunt Mary &ndash; which I hope to answer this mail or next. Yes, that 17th Octr 1914 seems a terribly long way in the dim and distant past. Even 6&frac12; months have passed since I landed here on the Peninsula and at the present rate of progress it looks as though we will put in a fair time here yet. It is rotten to be held up here when we might be doing better elsewhere, but as Kitch put it
