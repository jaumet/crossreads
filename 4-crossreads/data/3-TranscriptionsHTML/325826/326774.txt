<p>8.  Wal says "We have had a glorious trip across; the Mediterranean might almost have been Sydney Harbour for all the motion there has been.  This is no doubt   largely due to the splendid sea-going qualities of the ship.  We were unfortunate enough to lose one man overboard, but he jumped over deliberately.  We heard last night that a boat had been torpedoed near Malta, not 100 miles from where we were, so we are very thankful to be here cruising about between Toulon &amp; Marseilles waiting for morning.  We expect to disembark before mid-day &amp; set out on our long train journey across France, some say to Rouen, others to Amiens.  I don't think any of them really know excepting that it is to be in the north of France: they say we have been allotted a sector on the River Somme, but I expect we shall not be really in it for some time to come, the men certainly require a lot of training before they are ready for the Job.  I believe we are to be billeted in the French villages &amp; if this is correct I can hope to know some French by the time the campaign is over.<br/>Am hoping to get in touch with Rid &amp; Leo soon after arriving at the Depot.<br/>You may have had, before you get this of mine, something much more decent from Wal, I do hope you have.  Evidently they did not stay in France at all but went straight to England for training there, and as he suggest may be there for some time.<br/>This letter of Wal's must have come by the same English mail that brought Rid's I think, only Rid's happened to be delivered this morning a delivery earlier.  Wal's cable from London on 12th April is really the most recent after all.<br/>Very much love dear Father &amp; Mother<br/>Your very loving daughter<br/>Olive.</p>
