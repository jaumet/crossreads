  
 Enclosed is a piece of maiden hair from the hot house in Nouzha Gardens - Lots of chaps go there just to see the maiden hair because they say it is a bit of Australia My word I am glad you have got the car. Wonder if you have gone out to Nyngan yet.  I have some photos to send home but dont know when I can do it.  Expect it we will be traveling all day tomorrow. Think my address will be Machine Gun Squadron 1st Reg 1st Brigade ALH but 1st  Reg 1st Brigade will find me. Stella wrote saying she had sent a parcel but I have not go it yet - hope it is not lost as the last one she sent me was longer I ought to see Colin & Lecester as they are out at Romani too I think & of course Ronald Mc is in our Regt. This pen is rotton. Will write a decent letter as soon as I get out there. I am your very loving son Robert C. Wilson
