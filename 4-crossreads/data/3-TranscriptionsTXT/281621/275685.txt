 Sunday 11 Last night the 4th &amp; 5th went over on a raid which was an utter failure. Of the 100 who made up the party 75 per cent; were casualties. Our HDS is very inconvenient &amp; our colonel incapable. 
 Wednesday 14 Went for a walk to Edwards post to show Perkins round. A stunt is expected shortly &amp; he is in charge of reserve squads. Came back through High Wood where many tanks are stranded &amp; many monuments erected to those who took part in the fighting there. The tanks are being cleaned in anticipation of being used again. No word of leave yet. 
 Thursday 15 Tonight we were warned the Fritz intended bombing all rail heads. 
 Friday 16 This morning I was awakened by bursting bombs, machine gun fire &amp; anti-aircraft firing. Fritz caught a big ammunition dump &amp; from reports he caused considerable damage. Great clouds of smoke roll over the hills a few miles away, and the explosions are almost continuous.
