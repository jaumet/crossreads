Wednesday 5 March 1919Busy buying games - Concertina, Banjo, Picolo, Tucker etc. for voyage.  Very cold & wet for a wonder in Cairo - Dolly & Babe well.Had lunch at Shepheards with former costs 150 pt. equal to 1:10:- for a meal!!  I bought bought 1/2 lb. ham for Dolly, it costs 8/-s, eight shillings a pound!!!While on Tucker, will you get a ham cooked at Jagos also fowls & ducks say twice a week when you want them cold & leave the bill for me, if Dolly goes first.  I don't want Joe to go to any expense for her in any way & as she now thinks another Babe is coming - naturally the Mother must eat more.
