Anyhow by the time I get your letter informing me of it I have the satisfaction of knowing that she is better again. Congratulations  to Anna on her progress. I got a "Methodist" with all my screed on 'Lights Out ' in it. I almost forget writing it. It seems so strange now. It was just the expression of a mood caused by those experiences and that claimed an utterance. Anyhow if it does anyone any good I am thankful. Anna may be pleased with the enclosed letter coming to Australia with me 'apres la guerre' is one of the jokes Lucienne  & I have together. I hope Anna will write to her, she is a nice simple little thing though not smart in any way her French sometime may not help Anna. All the same the interchange is interesting. Tell Ol one more day gone & I am still at it in good health. I wrote her yesterday. Good fun in our trenches last night but I can't tell. Yours affecty Rid
