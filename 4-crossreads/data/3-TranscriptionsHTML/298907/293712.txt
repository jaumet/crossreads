<p>crook, some stunt believe me.</p>
<p>As we were coming home we bumps into old Beggs with his Kit bag, I wondered what on earth he was up to, it appears that he &amp; Rilen came in 20 min's late last night &amp; the Sister who must have been nursing a grievance grabbed them &amp; this morning had old Beggs set off under escort to the 1st Southern General, this is the result of yesterdays row you can bet your life &amp; its a dirty way of getting your own back, Rilen who is guilty of the same offence is to be confined to the Hospital for a week his pass having been stopped, &amp; he's not going crook about it either. poor old "Aussies", &amp; to think that we have come this far to be treated like this, makes my blood boil to think of it I'll bet they have got it in for all of us now, however they can send me out</p>
