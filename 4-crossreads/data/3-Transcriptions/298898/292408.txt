<p>* Total<br/>One division for 10 days</p>
<p>had been cut off &amp; when he left us there were none left. Everyone he came in contact with cut off a button &amp; he started buying favours by pointing them out when he learnt that everyone wanted one. Had I allowed it the beggars would have taken his cap knife etc. it being a perfect mania amongst the chaps. He had a gold watch &amp; chain &amp; each time he was handed over, the one in charge was notified of it so as to hand over intact &amp; so on. Large number of trench feet cases coming through we having passed through 940 * odd cases so far. Evidence is being taken &amp; I fancy that some of the O.C.'s will be hauled up over it as some divisions are singularly free from the trouble. So far as I can see the absence of warm food or drinks &amp; gum boots is responsible for most. Many of the men were crying with the pain &amp; I gave several morphia. Had a few shells land nearby during the day the nearest throwing mud on the roof.</p>
