<p>4.  future plans, I shall just have to wait a while &amp; see where the troops are going to settle down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I feel so badly over it all that I think I must come home, &amp; I have Rid's glad permission to do so exactly when I like.  But I am not sure yet that that is what I ought to do, it may be more my duty to go on to England much as I dread the old submarines &amp; aeroplanes.  It is awfully worrying to have no one to decide one's future plans for one, but there is absolutely nothing to do yet but wait a little.  And by the way in case I should go to England I want to correct a serious error I made in last week's letter in the address I gave you.  I was not quite satisfied at the time but could not find the list of addresses W Oakley had given me till after I closed your letter, it had slipped in between a folded paper, &amp; the letter from the folk in Southampton of course had no surname added.<br/>It is Mrs Osman (W.O's sister) "Corbie Lyn" 82 Lumsden Av. Shirley Southampton.  I told you "Oakley," though that is all wrong &amp; the rest all right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other Oakleys in Southampton &amp; one in London: but in any case any more travelling I do I will do through Cook's &amp; have all my letters addressed through them.<br/>I met Olive Clark's brother here yesterday &amp; he told me that she was married to John R. Nield B.A. L.L.B. on 18th March (they had had a cable from W.Nield he &amp; his brother)  I am very fond of her &amp; I wish I had known earlier.  I suppose he has his commission now.<br/>Well dear Father &amp; Mother I will close this just now.  Don't worry more than you can help &amp; so lose such a lot of hairs &amp; become so bald we won't know you when we come rushing in.  Many loving prayers for you in the anxiety of it all, &amp; very much love also the dear little Jobber,<br/>Very lovingly Your daughter<br/>Olive.</p>
