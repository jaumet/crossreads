SBY 5/6/18
O noble tree, so stately and so proud,That hurled a scornful challenge to the wind,Alas! too soon thy leafy head is bowed,To puny mortal's needs thy life assigned
I watch the flame a-glowing in the night,And know that what thou wer't thou art no more,A heap of ashes mark thy proud delight,As "dust to dust" laughs Nature's mocking law.
