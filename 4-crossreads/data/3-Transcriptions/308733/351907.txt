<p>24th Its getting a habit with me to write my letters in instalments. During the night one of our cooks was hit in the shoulder by a spent bullet, he was in a  supposedly safe place too, but bullets come in very queer ways, it will probably mean a trip to England or Malta for him lots of chaps are very lucky in getting superficial wounds that only require time to heal and do them no permanent injury as they get a trip to England perhaps and the best of attention all the time in fact some of them wont come back or hang out as long as they can while convalescing. Hope you have had rain. I know what it will meant to you to run short, we are cut very short at present &frac12; a gallon a day is the ration, it is a job to get enough water to have a shave and we look a ruffianly lot in consequence.</p>
