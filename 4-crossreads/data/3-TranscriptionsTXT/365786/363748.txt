Another question often asked is Can I vote away the life of another woman's son?  Why should I?  Someone said to me the other day "my boy was killed at the war - he was all thro' Gallipolli [Gallipoli] & then in France & now he's killed - do you think I want any other girl to be as unhappy as I am?  That is why I will vote no."  So I said "didn't you think it good & noble of him to go & fight for you & his country?  Yes she said I did.  Then don't you think he should have been reinforced?  Don't you think that you ought to insist on every fit man going to the front to carry on the work he was trying to do & that he laid down his life for?  What greater dishonour to those who died in the service of Australia than that Australia should no longer be represented at the Front!  How we cheered the boys as they marched off to the Front.  Often with our hearts in our throats & tears on our cheeks, but still we proudly waved good bye & God keep you didn't we?  We didn't then hear a storm of voices & columns of letters in the press
