Dearest WoofI have been very glad to get some letters from you lately, and today a parcel came that Mum said was from Frank, but had a washer in from Frank, and one from you, thank you very much for it, they will both be nice when I am having a bath, and also when I have a wash, as I only have one leg to stand on, and It is hard to wash
