  
 must have broken through - but though they crept up close, they showed no keenness for any bayonet work. In fact there has been very little bayonet work done at Anzac at all. Robert Scot Skirving was in my Bn, until shortly before we left Egypt, when he exchanged to the Light Horse. Archie Scot Skirving went out to the Dardanelles with  a  the New Army. He was wounded, & I heard died of wounds, but this is not confirmed. You would have been proud of the Australians, if you could have seen them in the assault of Lonesome Pine. I heard afterwards it was the best thing the Australians have done yet. The First Brigade had it - & I have never seen a more magnificent at the same time a more pitiable sight. The Artillery bombarded for an hour first, but owing to the shortness of range were unable to touch the Turks leading trenches, nor of course their machine guns - men simply went down in rows, but there was no check. We took the place & held it. When we were relieved 3 days the Brigade [indecipherable] 800. I took in 765 officers & men & brought our 183. I  lost  had 21 Officers killed & wounded out of 24. But the regiment was magnificent. I know I have never been is such a funk, as when I had to go across the open: it was then that the shell caught me. But you will be tired of hearing all about myself. I hope you will write again soon  C. Magnaghten
