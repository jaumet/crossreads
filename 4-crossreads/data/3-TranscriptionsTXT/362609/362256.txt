 was obtained. Numerous factory chimneys stood up above the crowded house tops and gave the impression that the city is a busy manufacturing centre. Beyond the unattractive city was the blue water with 1or 2 rocky islets and rugged cliffs showing up clearly on the other side of the bay and away to the horizon stretched the blue Mediterranean. It was a very pretty panorama seen in a fleeting patch of bright sunlight. A French workman doing some stonework at one of the viaducts reminded one of the saying that types are the same the world over. Although distinctly French he was a typical stone mason and would have at once been picked out as such from a crowd of men. From another steep cutting we ran through a tunnel very much longer than any I know in Australia, but in spite of its length and the fact we had 2 engines on, it was wonderfully cool and well ventilated. The country beyond was broken and undulating and seemed to be of a rather poor class. Large areas were under olives, but the fields looked stony and the soil poor. The trees had gnarled trunks and seemed stunted; in size they were similar to our orchard trees. Marseilles, we afterwards found, produces quite a notable quantity of olive oil. Presently we skirted along the shore of a large body of water on which were numerous fishing craft while sea birds flew here and there; it was a salt water lagoon connected with the sea by a narrow opening on the south. From here the route lay in a straight line across to the Rhone at Arles , leading through some miles of a magnificent avenue of well-grown cypresses on each side of the line. The telegraph posts were distinctive, being pine or fir arranged in pairs at right angles to the route, perhaps 8feet apart at the base and braced together by a strut from near the top of one to the base of the other. The numerous wires were attached to insulators on both posts. Rows of trees acting as windbreaks were planted amongst the olive gardens and cultivation areas, hawthorn hedges already showing signs of spring replacing them sometimes. Plum trees in blossom were a common sight and once or twice were seen tall horse chestnuts bursting into leaf. There were numerous stops and at every opportunity the men got out to stretch their legs until at last they commenced to roam so much that strict orders were issued that no one was to leave the train under any circumstances. It was a pity that all should be thus penalised. At one of the stops however, two or three womenfolk were standing by and Prescott engaged them in conversation. They were surprised to hear that we were  Australians and thought that we should have been black. At another stop were 2 farm wagons of a peculiar type; two wheelers with a long floor extending well in front and behind the axle. They were heavily loaded with
