for some things, one could almost wish, the present, might go on, for quite a long time. Would that all the world, were as peaceful, as we are here, on our little Island home, but dear [boys/lovys?], we must go  ​g ​​on, & hope for the best, through all, Surely surely, all may yet be well.
You would be dreadfully tired when you arrived at Bulford, Harry, I wished, I had taken you to the Station but perhaps Siddie would have a nice supper waiting and you would pop into your little bed and so a good rest . would set you up again.
It is 11 o'clock, Uncle says. bed time Annie. Marie went at 10 so I will finish with fondest love to you both &  a kiss each from Auntie,
P.S Your first little note Harry I shall always keep in remembrance [dear?] of you
