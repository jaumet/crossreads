<p>Heterogenous a difficult word to spell is the most suitable for describing the motley gang of Turks, Armenians, Greeks, Gurkhas, Tonkinese, niggers (no capital letter) and others on the lower decks.  In the Saloon fortunately reserved for Officers we are seven Australians to about 25 French.  They, the French are amusing, interesting and hospitable and appear to be very admiring of the Australians.  Altogether we are not having a bad passage up the Dardanelles, the water is flat thank Heaven and we get off tomorrow at Constantinople about eight du matin.  So good night to you and the boys.  I sleep on deck which will suggest to you two reasons, A it is mild, B there is no other place available.</p>
