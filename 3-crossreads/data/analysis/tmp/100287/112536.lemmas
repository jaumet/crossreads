 last night a littl bunch of us were sit up on my favourit place on the coil of rope when enorm shoal of fli fish start to hop out of the water , there were million of them the nois they made as they sprang out of the sea sound like great covey of quail rise , they look for all the world like swallow skim the wave but they do n't seem to be abl to dodg the wave for they disappear as soon as they hit them , they can fli till their wing get dri then they drop in to the sea , they must have had a lot of shark or someth amongst them to make the fish leav the water in the number they did , they say these fish are veri good meat but hard to catch , they grow to a coupl of pound weight by the look of them from a distanc are a grey color .
