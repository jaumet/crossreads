 Monday 12 November 
 Beautiful Day. Cleaning the bike all the morning.  After Dinner set off on a long round passing through Boeschepe, Berthen, St. Jans, dropped returns at A.D.M.S. Bailleul and other despatches at the Paymaster's &amp; Signallers &ndash; Continued on through Dranoutre, Daylight Corner, Lidenhoek &amp; Suicide Corner to the Main Dressing Station midway between Kemmel &amp; Wytschaete.  Returned to Remy Siding near Poperinghe. Passchendaele fell to the Germans this morning &amp; our bombardment this evening is terrific as a prelude to a strong Counter Attack.
