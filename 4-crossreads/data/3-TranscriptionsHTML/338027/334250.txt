<p>Sunday, 3 October, 1915<br/>A big mail in but none for the amb, in the past few weeks 6 men of the amb have been sent away with typhoid.  We heard to-day that Chanak had fallen but it was not confirmed we are convinced though that there has been a big Naval success somewhere.  Church parade in p.m. by Anglican Chaplain Capt Green I attended with my new mate the corporal he and I are of a very similar temperament and have much in common.</p>
<p>Monday, 4 October, 1915<br/>About 10 a.m there was a tremendous amount of shelling on the part of the Turks both on the left &amp; near us above Walker's somewhere in the vicinity of Courtney.  The Turks then jumped on their parapets preparatory to charging but must have got a scare as they got back again and it is rumoured that our lads counter attacked &amp; took two trenches.</p>
<p>We had to stand to arms &amp; those in the trenches had some shooting I was talking to two S.B.s [Stretcher Bearers] we were in a group when the nearest to me fell shot through the back by a stray Bullet.</p>
