 September 1918. Sunday 22 
 Ahead of La Vigure, Bty Position. Weather wet, and fairly cool. Rained very heavily during the afternoon. Fritz very busy all day with shells. Smithy wrote to Marg [indecipherable] mother. At 9 pm Fritz put down a barrage on the gully. Scottie while sitting alongside me in dugout, stopped one up the forehead. Had a nightmare as the lines which were constantly broken by the barrage.
