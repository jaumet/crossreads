<p>You go to bed at night<br/>And when to sink in blissful sleep<br/>The weary Billjim tries<br/>The mournful Jackal rends the night<br/>With cries, and cries, and cries</p>
<p>4<br/>And Spiders, lizards, snakes and ants<br/>Where ere you chance to roam<br/>All claim a vested interested in<br/>The place you call your home.<br/>And dust and sand and heat conspire<br/>To make these "Holy" shores<br/>A grim, vast, septic Hospital<br/>Of sores, and sores, and sores</p>
<p>5<br/>The Holy land's a golden place<br/>To read about in books<br/>But Billjim covered in its grime<br/>Just sees it as it looks<br/>There ain't no milk and honey<br/>Corn and wine is out of date<br/>And time here only stirs the chords<br/>Of hate, and hate, and hate</p>

<p>"Exiled from Home"<br/>In the cool and dewy morning<br/>When beneath the slanting ray<br/>Of the yellow orbs uprising<br/>Springs to birth a golden day<br/>From the dewy Eastern splendour<br/>How our memories, sweetly tender<br/>Turn our fancy to the Southland far away</p>
<p>[Four alternative lines (indecipherable) written over the above]</p>
<p>2<br/>In the brilliant noonday glory<br/>With the red sky all ablaze<br/>When the scorching blinding Kamseen<br/>Comes in whirling drifts of haze<br/>While we fume and sweat and swelter<br/>Vainly seeking some cool shelter<br/>Oh, its fine to think of Home &amp; better days</p>
<p>3<br/>In the evening when the Red sun<br/>Glides adown the Western sky</p>
