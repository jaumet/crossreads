  
 27.6.15 Sun. 27th.  A rally of rifle & machine gun fire woke us soon after daylight this morning.  The Turks we [were] apparently having a joke with us & started the business by dropping a few bombs on us, one dropped on the roof of the Drs. dug-out but fortunately it never exploded.  We had to stand to arms for half an hours.  The Turkish artillery played havoc with the New Zealanders' trenches & a piece of a shell fell in "Dad" Howarths dug-out cutting his blanket & oilsheet & only missed "Dad" by an inch or two.  The Turks undermined the 8th L.H. on the "R.F." & blew up there H.Q. at 2 a.m. this morning, killing & wounding a good many of them, quite a number of casualties on the beach to-day also & a bomb thrown over Courtneys Post accounted for 11 men.  We have been suffering rather heavily during the last few days.  The Turks are using a German mortar to throw bombs & it doing good work for them.
