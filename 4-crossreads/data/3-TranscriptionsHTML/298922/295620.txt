<p>Saturday 17th November 1917</p>
<p><strike>Red X wife &ndash; watch at Porter &amp; Smith.</strike></p>
<p>Found I had to pay 55/-/- passage money self &amp; wife!!!  I anticipated the Red X would pay her fare.</p>
<p>Then visited Laura at the Hospital, she is getting on well. I saw a good deal of young Charlie yesterday, we had lunch together &amp; he is a bonny boy &amp; I think will look after his Mother. Brace is in London but I don't see much of him.</p>
