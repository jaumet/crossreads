We got under way for Colombo on the afternoon of 1st April.  We arrived at Colombo on 9th April after a most beautiful trip across the Indian Ocean.  Left Colombo for Singapore on 14th April arriving Singapore on 22nd April.  We left Singapore for Batavia on 25th arriving there 27th April.  We remained there one day.  Some of the crew had a trip up to the town of Batavia while the officers were entertained by the Dutch Admiral.  We left again on the evening of 28th for Port Darwin arriving there on May 6th after a beautiful trip through the Dutch Islands.  There we were entertained by the residents to Sports and a concert in the evening.  We left Port Darwin for Cairns on May 9th arriving Cairns May 13th.
