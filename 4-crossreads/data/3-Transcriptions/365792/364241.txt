<p>June 10  a good long yarn about N.S.W. &amp; the boys. Arthur met me at the train &amp; we walked to the nearest tram &amp; then home. Ethel is rather jolly &amp; I like her, but I decline to go visiting &ndash; (Later) Ethel &amp; I <u>do</u> go visiting but the people are really jolly &amp; I enjoyed it no end. Also saw Isabel (in fact we stayed there for tea) but I was rather disappointed in her. "Such is life &ndash; &amp;and: photographers". Caught some rain but only a little. After tea Arthur &amp; I strolled through the main part of the City &amp; then trammed back, called at the Liberal Club for an hour or so &amp; from there home. Leeds is far bigger than I thought it was (pop of 400,000) &amp; it isn't a very dirty City. The tram service is good, &amp; of course they are all double deckers &amp; not single like Sy trams.</p>
<p>11  Up at 7am &amp; went for short stroll &amp; bought a couple of papers &amp; some chocs. After brek we all went to Church &amp; I'm sorry to say! Giggled muchly, but such is life [in margin] <u>Sunday</u></p>
