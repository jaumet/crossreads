<p>8/10/17 Broodseinde Ridge<br/>At about an hour before dawn the relief was "complete" about 110 rifles on 500 yards taking the place of over 320. The trenches are in a dreadful condition the men being up to their knees. All the while the shelling continues on both sides. We had a number killed and wounded one chap was blown absolutely to bits and cannot be identified by any means at all. At about 4 a.m. turned in for a little sleep in the little adjoining cell in this concrete place and slept on till about 9 a.m. The B.M. then came in and confirmed the attack orders so we set to forthwith to get to work and issue our own operation orders. Brought Rodda down from the line and put the poor tired exhausted old chap to bed. All the morning busy on orders. At noon called down all the company commanders and discussed the plans. Poor dejected &amp; depressed chaps. I preserved a cheerfulness that I did not feel. Sent Davis and Tayles out. Towards evening it became wet and the place flooded</p>
