contain spy code information.Put in an application to O.C. asking that I may be transferred to a unit where I could be more suitably employed. My C.O.s gave me a good recommendation and officer promised to put it through to H.Q.Thu 14 More rain, plenty of mud. Camp again shelled.Fri 15th. Our locality still being shelled. Gas somewhat troublesome.Saty 16 Everything fairly quiet. One shell fell within few feet of 40 men camped in surface structures. No damage done.Sun 17th. All round us enemy artillery is searching for batteries with heavy shells. Our camp is in a bad position. A road and a light railway encircle it. Near us is situated a dump and our home is far more conspicious conspicuous than it should be. Complaints have already been made regarding this and we hear today that we are to be removed, shortly, to a spot not under direct observation. The heavy shelling continues yet our narrow strip of territory remains unmolested.
