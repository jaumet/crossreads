I would have gone to if I could have found my pay book.  It is amusing to walk through the various decks and see the rainbows of colour.  The French uniforms made from the palest of blue to the most glaring of red trousers, even to the tassels on their shoes, everything for show.  I have been detailed off to assist to the hospital whilst on board.  I have been informed that there are stripes waiting, if offered I am going to refuse them, for conscientious [?] reasons.  We have a lot of fine mules on board belonging to the A.S.C. also French officers [indecipherable].  We will know our future intentions when we arrive at Lemnos. 
 Friday, 4 June Received three bed patients to-day.  I also assist in the dispensary, with the medical nursing knowledge I have gained I will be a first class quack by the time I get back which I hope will be in Nov.  The food is a little better on this boat but the accomodation  is poor.  I had an amusing experience in the middle of the night.  Owing to my speaking Arabic I had during the day been conversing with some of the Egyptian sergeants during which I told them my name, well about two a.m. I heard a knock at my cabin and it was one of the sergeants, he cried [in arabic] "[indecipherable] Morris Effendi, [indecipherable]"  I went down and found the man suffering from colic, so I fixed him up and they tried to show their gratitude every way. I refused it so Capt Fowler who they spurned they had no [indecipherable] in him, but because I spoke their language, I was one of them.
