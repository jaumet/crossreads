We ran wild for a couple of days after coming here much to the annoyance of the heads, had to be medically treated again & was found fit. some of the chaps were pronounced unfit for service after coming this far. they did not seem the least annoyed about it either. I and the rest of A. Co were vaccinated yesterday. every one in the camp has to be done. In company with a cobber, I had a good look round the pyramids, climbed twice to the top of the great pyramid and had a look inside it, it is fearfully & wonderfully made. composed throughout of limestone blocks, of pretty tidy dimentions. they are very easy to climb by the corners, but in the middle it is a different and somewhat dangerous thing. we tried a new route, but had to give up when half way to the top. in fact we got nervous, so cut across diagonally to the corner.
