yellow dab was a small crab - Body about 3/4 of an inch & speckled black & white  -  The yellow was due to a large 1 inch single claw  -  They scuttled into holes as soon as you approached - the claw acting as a lid (like the cat's eye)  -  If you stopped one by catching hold of his claw he instantly shed it & off he went as lively as ever  -  He'd only one claw & that on the Right side  -  He had 2 stalked eyes  -  I collected a handful of hermit crabs for Rawdon  -  There are millions of them  -
I noticed also how the mangrove shrubs send down roots from the trunk & branches to grow into the mud  -  They are long brown supple sticks with a small black cap on the end of each & they seek the ground, just like the screw pines do with their roots  -  Once in the ground they throw out roots & eventually the shrub looks as if it grew out of the top of a big crab or lobster pot  -  There shrubs with their roots & their fruit - torpedo shaped & ready formed to stick into the mud & start growing  -  Lines much of the shore  -
