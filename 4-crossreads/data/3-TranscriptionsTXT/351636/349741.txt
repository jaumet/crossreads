 Dear Mr. Horsfield &ndash; Can you give Mrs. Bourne (widow) &ndash; some regular assistance as I don't think she is quite up to scale that you assist &ndash; &amp; self &amp; children have been sick. She has a W's account with her &amp; is in need of clothing she tells me. 
 Yours truly E. H. Bennie.
