23/1/19 Gourdinne
Last evening spent a very happy few hours with Gorman chez Yvonne Legait. Sitting round the table we had singing and discussed all the scandals of Belgium ? the Baroness de Vaughan c. Yvonne is something of a beauty ? natural and unaffected but does not look strong. M. Fernande Crochelet was with us and it was midnight when we parted. This morning it is a leaden sky and powdery drifting snowflakes are falling on the frozen roads and footways. Inspected Headquarters billets. Afternoon took a walk through neighbouring woods ? snow lying round still among the grass and roads and paths icebound. To the edge of Thy le Chateau then home. Yarned with Gorman and then read and wrote after Mess.
