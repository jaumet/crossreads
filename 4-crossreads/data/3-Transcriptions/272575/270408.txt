"it's a good Idea." and one that is going to cause a great deal of fun and also a very great deal of annoyance, if put into Practise.   the man who is responsible for the suggestion evidently has a very poor knowledge of Pigs, or else just wish's to see how many fools will try the game.   he suggests that the London County Council, allow suburbanites to keep a pig and the Local Sanitary Insp. go round and see that piggys quarters are kept clean.   now just fancy a Business man rising early, to feed Piggy, clean his pen, then get ready for work at the office.    of course feed for the animal is easily procured.     any one who has kept pigs knows that, scraps from the house, that would otherwise be wasted are good, then some Turnips, they are fairly cheap.   A few other items, and then if you are lucky you may grow a Pig worth 3&#163; [indecipherable]. for not less than 5&#163; when all expenses are counted up.   then who's going to kill poor Piggy.

At present the British troops are holding a very large portion of the line and a lot of the French are back resting    I expect that means putting in crops etc. behind the lines.</p>
