 August 1915 several of the warships to buy stuff to take back with us  We were on the "Exmouth" "Bacchante" "Theseus" "Edgar" &amp; "Royal Ark"  It was a busy day &amp; I got a good headache. 
 Friday 13th Had a headache all day &amp; was sick in the afternoon.  Didn't go on guard at night as I was feeling too crook. 
 Saturday 14th Paraded to the doctor in the morning &amp; got 2 pills which I swallowed during the day at intervals.  Was feeling a lot better in the afternoon &amp; the headache was nearly gone.  Took some stew at dinner time.  Was feeling pretty hungry as I had missed about 4 meals.  I had to cut out the swimming worse luck.  Packed up at night ready for an early start in the morning
