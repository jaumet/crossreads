<p>number of little houses, that look like Bathing-boxes. They are right up high onto the side of the road. The women sit   &amp; sew there. While the children play on the sand   &amp;  smooth stones look like large pebbles. These huts are arranged ;ole cosy sitting rooms with the front opening on to the sea. It gives the place a very gay appearance. Have been busy to-day fixing some of my things to go on leave. We are fairly quiet. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses   &amp;  hope you are all well.  From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
