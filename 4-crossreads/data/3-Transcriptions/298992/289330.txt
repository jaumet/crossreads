<p>from Colombo &amp; are having a perfectly smooth sea &amp; fine sunny weather, not hot at all. In fact I have been surprised the last fortnight, how cool it has been.</p>
<p>How is Dene getting on with the Matric.? Of course when you get this, he will have had the exam, and I sincerely hope, passed, in which case congratulate him for me. Has that little money matter of his turned out all correct? If not tell him to go up to Victoria Barracks, they will fix him up there. We only get 1/- a day on board ship, but of course get paid the rest on arrival at destination. The reason of this is that a lot of the men only gamble it away when they get it, and the Heads think it will be safer with them till we land. I think it is a good idea too. I know I would only spend mine at the Canteen if I was paid it all.</p>
<p>The rumour is that we are going to Marseilles &amp; not Egypt, but time only will tell that. Myself I think Egypt will be our Headquarters for some time.</p>
<p>Are you keeping well? You really ought to have that well-earned holiday you promised yourself months ago. It would be good experience for Hazel. How are Rollo &amp; Wilga. I guess Rollo will not know me when I return. I have grown a moustache, will get a photo of it in Egypt. It looks dead funny. With tons of Love to you all. Alan.</p>
