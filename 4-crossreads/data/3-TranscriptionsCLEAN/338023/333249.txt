Tuesday & Wednesday.Going south close in to coast, fine weather & beautiful scenery. The sea is so smooth & burnished that its sometimes hard to tell which is sea & which is cloud. All is dazzling whiteness with an occasional dark band marking the cruise of one of the numerous currents.
Evening 15th  We have swung round to the S west & are making good running. The Drakenrsberg Ranges lie overside like an endless chain of mine-dumps,  peak & ridge arranged in excellent order all alike, & tinted with every shade of purple. They must be about 70 miles away. Between them & the sea numerous scrub fires are clouding the coast line with a fine, blue haze. Saw the whalers taking in a catch to Durban. There are plenty sperm whales in these waters.

We hurried some for a while but soon lost sight of her. Passed Cape Agulhas at
