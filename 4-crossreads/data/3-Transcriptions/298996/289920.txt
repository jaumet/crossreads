<p>Mule chasing now. Mule on back</p>
<p>23-6-15<br/>Letters from bike chaps. Things were very [indecipherable] until midday the The Turks gave us something to keep us awake. One man while swimming was hit with a cap off same it ripped the arm off him at the elbow on this hit &amp; fair saved [indecipherable] in half the caps were flying in all  direction take the bullets. We are going <strike>sapping</strike> to [indecipherable]<br/>24-6-15<br/>Just as we marched off last &amp; Shrapnel burst over head &amp; the shell hit the side of Cliff close by which caused stones to fly all directions one stone hit a chap on the shin &amp; to see the look of horror on his face it made us all laugh at him. He moved further on without further ado. While <strike>sapping</strike> doing our work last night which was watering the beach with salt water so as to harden same for the Franons thing were very quiet. But at 3 AM. a Destroyer which had its searchlight on the Turkish trenches on our left flank, all night gave them something to go on with re 24 shells quick &amp; lively. I am told it made them do the Turky Trot. It was a beautiful night <strike>with</strike> (half moon). Just where we were working the Indian mule drivers were watering their <strike>horse</strike> mules just before going to work to hear them jabbering at times in real Australian language <strike>it</strike> one has to laugh at them mind you they only use same when the mules get troublesome (which is often) Shrapnel full of iron</p>
<p>25-6-15<br/>Nothing much doing other than a few shrapnels paying us a visit. As we were going on a fatigue a shrapnel burst on a cliff near by &amp; of course sent stones off same about somewhat. One stone hit a chat on the shin &amp; to see the look of dismay on this face it made one laugh I can assure you that he moved further on at the double. is night..</p>
<p>26-6-15<br/>It is morning, fire broke out in one of the Chaps dugout &amp; his equipment caught on fire &amp; to hear the ammunition exploding one would think it was Kings birthday. While sapping were were gritted with a few rounds of bullets</p>
<p>27.6-15<br/>I was going for a swim about 5 oclock this morning &amp; the Turks started the attack a dummy one it appears but I did not go as expected we may have been called but to date</p>
