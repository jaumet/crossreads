<p>Pension where John Hughes &amp; myself stayed during our visit in Paris. To my delight the old lady was there &amp; though she did not recognise me at first, after a few minutes conversation she remembered me. She was frantic with delight &amp; spoke so rapidly that my knowledge of French was hard put to it to keep in touch with her. She asked me to be sure &amp; stay with her when I get leave to go to Paris. She is a dear old thing &amp; I was more than delighted at meeting her again.</p>
<p>I left Paris at 8.15 a.m. on Tuesday April 4th, had a few hours at Calais &ndash; then after spending the night at a rest house for officers I reported back to the 18th Battalion on the following morning.</p>
<p>I was glad to be back with all my friends &amp; take up regimental work again. Officers &amp; men were quartered with french families who could not do enough for us.</p>
<p>Next day Friday we moved off bound for the trenches. En Route we were inspected by General Joffre. He looked remarkably well</p>
