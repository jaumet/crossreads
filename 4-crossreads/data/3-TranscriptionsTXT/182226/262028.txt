Feeling a bit tired.
The weather is beginning to get windy with a promise of rain.
Rain came on late in the afternoon & the sea got up a good deal. It is a pitch dark night & the boat is rolling horribly.
We have as escort a little trawler which carries two light guns. She is rolling all over the place & shipping a lot of water.
We have to have our lifebelts with us all the time & are all told off to certain boats in case of being torpedoed. I am in No 13 mess & 13 boat so according to anyone of a supersticious nature I don't stand much chance of pulling through if anything happens.
