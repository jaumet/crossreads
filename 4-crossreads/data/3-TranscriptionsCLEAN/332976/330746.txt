November 191613th   Another heavy barrage was carried out by the artillery which started about 7 a.m. & lasted for about an hour.The route of the drain has been altered & we have been taking the levels all the morningThis afternoon we got another fatigue party of about 60, for the drain, & continued with its construction.  About 4 p.m. one of the men struck a bomb with his pick & exploded it.  He was mortaly wounded & died about half an hour later.  We got a mail in to-night & I have received a few letters from England, the first I have had since I landed in France.
