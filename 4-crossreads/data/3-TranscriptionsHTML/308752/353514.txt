<p>Samson, was absolutely superb. M. Darmel, who takes the part of Samson, possessed a fine Tenor Voice. At the end of the opera Mlle. Aida Boni one of Frances most famous dancers gave her wonderful ballet scene, &amp; a wonderful performance it was too. The Opera House is the most famous in the World, there are five galleries, &amp; all except the top one contains boxes or lodges, holding six seats.   we had very good seats &amp; once again we were lucky, an Englishman was in the same lodge as ourselves so of course he helped us along &amp; explained different items. The dome of the theatre was gorgeous, one mass of lights. Between the acts, the people stroll along the beautiful foyer or promenade one would think that he was in a palace, not a theatre.  The show ended about 11.30, starting at 7.30, so we had a most enjoyable evening. The performance will always remain in my memory.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 9th December our last day of leave, we stayed at the hotel all the morning, &amp; enjoyed living in comfort. At it was raining slightly, I made my way to the writing room &amp; stayed there, till it was time to visit our old haunt Caf&eacute; de la Negre &amp; enjoyed another sumptuous meal.  In the afternoon we went for another stroll along the banks of the Seine.  This river runs through the city, whose green waters flow between the wharves &amp; beneath the arches of seven bridges. Le Pont Alexandre or Alexander Bridge, is said to be the most beautiful bridge in Paris. Four magnificent statues adorn each corner mounted in bronze. From here we took a taxi to Luna Park, pleasure grounds, &amp; skating rink. A huge crowd was present, &amp; a great number of Australians &amp; American soldiers I noticed in the skating rink. Then back to our Caf&eacute; at 6 oclock, to have our last meal there, &amp; we enjoyed it, I can assure you. After tea we strolled into a number of Cafes, &amp; had the time of our lives "believe me". Return to Hotel, at an early hour, &amp; made our way to the Drawing Room, as some very nice French People were there</p>
