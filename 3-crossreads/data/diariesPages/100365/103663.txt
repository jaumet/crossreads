through the pieces of shrapnel falling after having been fired at the planes by our own guns.Our Company has just had, in my opinion an absurd inspection of Harness etc, which took up the main part of the afternoon. Fancy having to keep Pole chains steel links shined up, whilst on active service, yet this is what has to be done.HQ ASC moved out today at 9 a.m. to Baillieul where they entrained for an unknown destination. It has been very quiet in Armentieres today our waggons have gone right up to the trenches never been shelled once.I understand we are to go back to Fletre either tomorrow or the next day, our HQ to go to Merriss. This means I suppose that half our Company will go to Strazzeel Caestre.
