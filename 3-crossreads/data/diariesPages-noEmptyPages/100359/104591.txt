Saturday 5th
Another quiet day. Mail arrived at mid-day. Got a letter from France, also one from Nell telling me about having said "yes" to Mr. Hook. Wrote to Mother, Lill and Nell also to Mr. Hook to congratulate him. Spent an enjoyable evening at the Tommies canteen, where they have a piano. Had a good old sing-song until they closed at 8. Then we came back to our farm and had some Grand Opera, in which the "Roan Colt" was the star performer. 
 Sunday 6th
The guns are banging away day and night, so Fritz must be getting some "hurry up" had a most enjoyable service in our Mess Room. Cosier took it and preached a jolly good sermon. A big mob of cavalry went by last night. They had just come from the Somme and looked quite battle scared. It is jolly cold in our dairy. Maj. Newell promised us an extra blanket, but we haven't got it yet.
Monday 7th   
Last night was A.Sec. "night out" quite a number of them returning with a decided list. We got our extra blanket last night and slept much warmer. This farm is also a kind of "Rest Camp" C. Section are running it, and they have a number of chaps to look after who are suffering from shell shock and other minor war complaints. Before we went to sleep we witnessed a bloodthirsty encounter between the "Roan Colt" and "Mackiinlay" It was a very good go, but "Mac" had weakened somewhat in getting down to the weight of the man from the Sugar Country. They draw a good house, but a large number of the "front benches" were "dead heads" Promotor Sullivan is doing his best to arrange a return match, but it would be much better for all concerned if he could eliminate a big number of "Bakshee" patrons. The result was a draw, as the referee could not decide which of the men had swallowed the most beer.
