<p>Deiran<br/>15/2/18<br/>Pack up and leave camp with HQ men and proceed to Latron.<br/>16th<br/>Leave 7 am and proceed.  Wagon nearly lost near Motza through break giving way.  Arrive Jerus 5 pm and meet Kenny &amp; [indecipherable].  Arrive Bethlehem 6 PM and camp in an old Greek Monastry.<br/>17th<br/>Windy dirty Day<br/>18th<br/>Pack up ready to move out.<br/>19th<br/>Leave Bethlehem 10 am with pack animals and have a very rough trip through the narrow streets.  Crowds of people line the way.  Wind up and down the bridle path and eventually get a glimpse of Jerusalem over all the rough country.  Awful rocky country having to lead the animals most of the way.  Have lunch 3 PM in a little grassy patch &amp; move on and at dark camp up on the hill overlooking the Dead Sea.<br/>20th<br/>3 am move on again in rain and wind up and down, reaching the flats near a big redoubt which is being shelled heavily.  Spread out and get across as quickly as possible.  Hide under cover of the redoubt all day and get the wind up over a few close shots.  Erect station at dark and do some traffic.  Men set out</p>
