The men who were detailed for guard over the officers kits aboard refused to leave the wharf this morning and consequently officers had to guard the boat and guard their own gear.<br/>Major Burret of the 3rd Btn Officer i/c N.S.W. and Queenslanders called a meeting this afternoon and told us that if we went aboard the ship he would see that each man had a hammock to sleep in (there was a shortage during the trip) and would issued with clean blankets. The ship would be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.</p>
