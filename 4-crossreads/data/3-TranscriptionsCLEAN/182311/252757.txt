bed, to sleep until 1.30 a,m. and then to do an eight-hours tour of Guard.  Monday morning a hopeless dawn, for no more leave, at 3 p.m. we left the wharf and anchored in the bay, awaiting sailing orders, these came about 9-30 next day, and away we went at 1 o'clock.
   I am making a few photos to send with these pages, places seen and visited.  I have not enough printing paper on board to make several sets of photos so I'll just send one of each, first.  Capetown: these are a few impressions, situations and environs are very beautiful, Lord Richard Bryce in his book on South Africa says that "It rivals Naples and Constantinople" - high praise.  The town is a disappointment to a tourist in search of the antique for most of the Dutch buildings have disappeared and the two canals have been filled in.
   The quantity of colour is disgusting to the average Australian, really at times I felt quite pleased and relieved to see a white face.  And the graduations in colour are amazing, from the nearly white to the pure native, the latter is usually far preferable to the former.
   No, I wouldn't like to live in Capetown, Melbourne for me.
   With all love.
   Harold.
