<p>the cheeky little field guns kept plugging away, I was expecting every minute to see the gun &amp; its crew go flying sky high, but no, I'm hanged if he could hit it &amp; the battery was still firing when he knocked off.  Had a shave this evening, first one for 10 day's &amp; I wanted it bad enough as you may guess, but everything has been against a man lately &amp; we have been so miserable &amp; wet, however I borrowed an article here &amp; there &amp; scraped my face clean again for a man might just as well be killed clean as dirty.<br/>Sent a fatigue over to Flers village where our Hqrs are, to draw 48 hours iron rations this in preparation for the charge.  Had a fairly liberal issue of rations this evening, bread, jam, butter cheese, bully, milk, bacon, raisins, pork &amp; beans, tobacco &amp; matches, one of the best for some time</p>
