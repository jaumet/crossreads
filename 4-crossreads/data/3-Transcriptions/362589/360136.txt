Amongst other things we saw the Arabia come in to the wharf (at Port Melbourne) for the first time. She had on board the body of the late General Bridges brought from the Dardanelles. It was taken off very quietly. Next morning there was a lying-in-state for a few hours in the Cathedral and a funeral cortige in the afternoon, but as we left at 4 p.m. we did not see either.<br/>During the rough weather we had to resort to cards to pass away the time &ndash; the continual pitching and tossing was so monotonous but between Fremantle and Durban I hope to get some reading done. We have a couple of very good pianists on board also men with other instruments including 'cello &amp; flute and quite a number of singers. With this material to work on we have had an occasional concert, both enjoyable and of fair average standard.<br/>I am enjoying very good health and appear to be a good sailor. Am putting on weight and also, incidentally, growing a moustache.<br/>Please give my kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; Keith, also Edward who by now, I suppose, is quite at home with his work.<br/>With all good wishes<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/><u>L.
