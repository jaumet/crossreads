After dinner I borrowed a bike from the Engineer's took a run up to the Battalion, for the mail was closing for Australia to day the boys had a lot of letters to be censored so I collected them all took them up to their Coy.'s collected what mail there was for them up there to bring back with me, while up there the Sergt Major said that I would be coming back most likely tomorrow to take charge of a Platoon so that would mean another rise for me, I am doing pretty well lately am I not; Len I believe is getting his 2 stripes today he should have had them long ago by rights,
