<p>May 11, 12<br/>skeleton &ndash; frame partitions screening across the centre from the tall double doors of either side, add intricacy to the low tie beams and their struts.  The far end gable &ndash; a brick wall strutted outside by a buttress pier &ndash; has a round window, filled with a primitive spoking of bricks, in the night a luminous sky fills it with a rich colour, and the shadows of the roofing, with the framings catching of light all the more suggests an old villiage church turned to a Billet.  A rumour tonight of two landings at Zeebrugge and at Ostende:  but it's a tall telling &ndash; the Boche is not asleep on the coast, and his defences are there surely something to wounder at.  B. Bearers up to the war tomorrow, we perhaps to Borre.</p>
<p>May 212<br/>132.<br/>Borre, A.D.S.<br/>From La Cruele [La Kreule] this afternoon to A.D.S. to work with C. Section.  Night Duty clerking with the dark Assryian [Assyrian].  He reminds me always of "The Cup Bearer" of the wall painting of the Palace of Knossos.  His features full of the beauty of the Assryian carvings, but without that strong character of cruelty:  as the wounderful Jake is full of a Greek Paganism transplanted to Australia, so Watts is the Assryian after centuries of the sun and blue of Australia.  Though he's been in the unit since Ypres, he's practically a stranger.</p>
<p>May 13<br/>133.<br/>a.m.<br/>Just for a minute saw Vin Davis last night:  he passing the A.D.S. going up with G.S. wagons.</p>
<p>Mail yesterday a barren choice in Books Catalogue from Holland Bros. and List No. 3 Clearance List from Davis and Oriole, the morning damp and a grey cold windy mist about the billet:  and the afternoon a sun through the clouds that cast no shadows.  So I wrote to Davies &amp; Oriole for the only book of their list of any appeal &ndash; the 1st edition of Georgian Poetry 1913-15, 8/6.</p>
<p>134.<br/>p.m.<br/>An enthusiasm growing again for a No. 5 Ghutz.  Basil down to La Cruele today and saw Owen B. &ndash; he sending up a book of copy:  but its stuff published in several rags, and the idea of Ghutz was to only hold original stuff, so Owen to write up something during the next few days.  Capt. Murphy expresses interest, promises article, also Capt. Scolds.</p>
<p>The press down with B. Tent Sub. but the Col. promises to have it sent up to us.</p>
