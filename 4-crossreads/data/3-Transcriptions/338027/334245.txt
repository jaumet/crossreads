<p>Thursday, 23 September, 1915<br/>Every night each squadron is out either patrol, outpost, in the trenches or digging &amp; making saps.  It is all night work &amp; the day off, last night &amp; to-day have been bitterly cold.  The joking rumour now is that they are going to land [indecipherable] as it will be too cold for us.  Typhoid is breaking out now it is rather bad at Lemnos, in the next few days we will be busy inoculating against it.  From our trenches they killed two big fat Turks that exposed themselves, they were snipers, they got one with the machine gun, the other with the rifle so they avenged the chap they got yesterday.</p>
<p>Friday, 24 September, 1915<br/>Sick parades becoming much smaller, mostly dressings.  The Dr is very unpopular it is very hard to get on with him, in private life he is a man that one would feel like mocking; he has a horrible sneaking way and only a crawler would get on with him.</p>
<p>About nine at night we were surprised by a terrific artillery bombardment on the right followed by heavy rifle and machine gun fire, we dont know what the attack was.  We did not have to stand to arms.  Some of the 25 of the bodyguard came over with stores to-day they say that every day the German taube drops bombs on G.H.2</p>
