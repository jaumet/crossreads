  
 Ellis is sending a menu & it will explain itself.  We waited on the Boys at Dinner time.  I am no good as a waiter.  3 plates was my limit & I was soup all over, the gravy would run out of all my dishes.  Things are ever so much better at the Hospital now & we are having a much more cosy time.  We have had no snow yet.  But on X'mas morning there was a 1/2 covering of Hail, of which we have had a considerable amount lately. 
 We had a lovely parcel of sweets each from Mr. C.L. Jones on X'mas Eve.  Also, a very fine X'mas parcel from Red Cross besides Cigarettes galore.  I don't smoke but they are good to pay my Patients for extra work that they do to help me.  I am having a very pleasant time now.  We have nothing to do after 5 p.m. & no parades except the morning
