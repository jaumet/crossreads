<p>3.  an intense desire to giggle.  It's no use it's deep-rooted in us &amp; I caught Walter in the act also one day before he left!  Even having a U.S. father doesn't seem to erase it!<br/>Now just a few words about that cable (the birthday one.)  You will at least know by now, from my last letter, that when I sent it I hadn't dreamed of you hearing anything about Rid's sickness, but how funny you must have thought it that I didn't say he was well or better or something.  Oh no though! Now I come to think of it you thought it was sent by Rid &amp; that very fact proved he was well again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so glad that it reached you before the birthdays, even though it was not all quite clear to you, I was very anxious for it to get there in time.  I hope you have not since been disappointed to find that at that time we had not all seen each other as the cable implied.  As a matter of fact I had got Walter's permission to include his name and had written to Leo telling him I was going to include his, so that we really were all in touch over it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was so nice to hear of how you spent Father's birthday, it sounded all very sweet &amp; restful and I hope Mother's was spent as nicely, we ought to hear about it next mail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortnight between mails seems a long while to wait does it not?<br/>So far I am afraid I have no news to give you of Wal and Le, and the diary part of Rid's letter I sent on to you two days back &amp; there has been nothing since.   However I shall not close this yet for some days &amp; there may be something more by then.  I rather fear that they may be holding back military letters &amp; if so I suppose we shall have to believe it is for some wise purpose and be glad of the precautions they are taking, though letters do mean so much don't they.  I expect I should not have had the one I did from Rid only that he gave it to the Purser on the "Bohemian" to post when they got back to Alexandria.  A happy thought wasn't it?</p>
