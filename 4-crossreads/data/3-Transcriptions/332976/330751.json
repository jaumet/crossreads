<p>November 1916<br/>(19th continued)   which went out for a spell about a fourtnight ago, is returning &amp; the advance guards arrived here to-day.<br/>20th   I finished the culvert I have been making &amp; it is rumoured that we are moving to-morrow.<br/>21st   We shifted camp this morning to "dugouts" about half a mile to the right of Longueval, &amp; nearer the line.  About six weeks ago the Germans were in possession of these parts &amp; the ground is one mass of shell holes.  On our left are the ruins of a large sugar refinery &amp; the "duck-board"</p>
