Tuesday
Passed night at so so, a few shells over. Fool round all morning waiting for orders to move back. Whilst waiting Fritz began sending over more shells. One unlucky one lobbed on to the tent where we slept last night. One poor 13th FA Linden by name was killed also 2 pioneers on the road. It settled us all somewhat. There are some marvellous escapes. After a lot of useless delaying we got off from Longueval about 2 p.m. 1st 2nd 3rd F. Amb. bearers under Lieut-Col. Hearne of 2nd F.A. A long tiring march brought us to Biscaudal where we encamped for night.
