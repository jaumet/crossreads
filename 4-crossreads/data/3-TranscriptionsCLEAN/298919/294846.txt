women & children killed, though no great damage done.  After dinner went for a trip across the transporter bridge to the other side of the river.  The river acts as a boundry line between Durham & York.  Had a pleasant walk along through fields of wheat & hay, returned in time for tea.  After tea Purser & self caught the train & went to West Hartlepool.  Here we caught a tramcar & went to East Hartlepool.  This is the place that was bombarded by German warships some time ago, all the damage has however been repaired so there was nothing of interest to see.  We got back to the Ship about 10p.  Raked out some preserved fruits made tea and had some supper got into bed just before the lights went out at 11pm.
