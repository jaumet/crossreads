<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Saturday 25</p>
<p>Left by ferry for Inter Base &amp; after landing had to walk 3 miles carrying full kits to base camp.</p>
<p>This camp is pretty miserable but is situated on a hill with a good view.  There are 3 villages in sight &amp; they look picturesque in the distance.  The sunset over the hills reflected on these collections of stone house made a very nice view.</p>
<p>Food very poor &ndash; bread hard biscuits, rice &amp; bully beef stew.</p>
<p>Informed that we move on to Anzac in the morning at 7 oclock.</p>
