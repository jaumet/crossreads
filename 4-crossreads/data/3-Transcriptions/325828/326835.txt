<p>Please thank Anna for her note to hand to-night.  Am enclosing stamps as requested &amp; tell her she can have the post-cards if she wishes.  Leo.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I must thank you for your letter of 24th to hand yesterday.<br/>In a short note to Walter last week I told him that I had finally decided to go to the front &amp; do my share.  I expect to be <strike>down</strike> leaving here next Monday week (7th prox) providing the Dr. passes me alright this end.<br/>The leg is nearly healed now but there is an angry looking swelling about an inch below the wound.  To-night it is about the size of a pigeon's egg.  I am keeping it poulticed &amp; it is owing to the awkward position I am in (that of lying up with a poultice on) that my writing is all skewiff.  I am going in to Dr Alan Walker (an old S.H.S. boy) on Saturday to see if I'll pass for pig-sticking, &amp; if the boil affair hasn't broken then I will get him to lance it for me.<br/>We expect to finish sowing on Saturday<br/>Excuse the brevity of the note for I am anxious to get to bed &amp; rest the leg<br/>Love to all,<br/>from Your loving son&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo</p>
