<p>8 &ndash; to see a man I nursed with Meningitis at Lemnos, Private Palmer. I was not allowed to go to the wards &ndash; but he came out and sat on the wall of the hospital garden to talk. He had written me a note the day before to ask me to come if I could. His eyes were full of tears of gratitude &ndash; poor child. They get so fearfully lonely. This is about the 6th week of being shutfor him and he has not had any letters or parcels from home since his illness. He is the man who tied the chocolate box ribbon round his head on Christmas morn to show his desire to be gay on that happy day. I took him a tin of biscuits you sent me - and some sweets Major Morshead has sent me from the Army &amp; N. Stores &ndash; and a book Sister Steele of P.A.H. sent me "Brothers" Vachell. This is just one of the thousands of boys who are lonely &amp; sick over here. This one wants to get back to his regiment instead of being sent to Australia.</p>
