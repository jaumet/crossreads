<p>Sunday 26 March 1916<br/>Church Parade.  Col. Fuller attended.  Went to Canal for swim with Lieu. Chisholm.  It was most refreshing &amp;amp; one is struck with the vastness of the work accomplished when the two Sea became one.  Trees line the Canal Banks, &amp;amp; protect the ground from slipping.  Protectors are also built some distance from Canal to catch most of the Sand during heavy gales.  The Vice-Roy of India, Lord Chermsford  &amp;amp; Suite passed through on their way to their new Home.  No swimming is allowed between the Hours of Noon &amp;amp; 5 p.m. to-day.</p>
<p>Monday 27 March 1916<br/>Regimental parade.  I went to Ismaila by 9-20 a.m. train to get Washing &amp;amp; Groceries.  Major White &amp;amp; Ted Reed went to Cairo tonight.<br/>The Native Quarters here are the far end of Ismaila, &amp;amp; most of the Business is done at this spot.  It is a busy spot about miday when the Troops come in to buy up quantities of Stuff for their respective Units.  The Railway Station is a busy spot, &amp;amp; thousands of Arabs &amp;amp; niggers in general congregate here awaiting the Cairo &amp;amp; Port Said Train.</p>
<p>Tuesday 28 March 1916<br/>7th Regiment on all night outpost duty, very dark &amp;amp; many of the men lost their way.<br/>5 per cent of my are allowed 48 hours off for Holidays.<br/>This country is very difficult to grasp owing to the sameness everywhere.  The stars are excellent as Guides also every Officer &amp;amp; N.C.O. carries a compass.</p>
<p>Wednesday 29 March 1916<br/>Terrible heat wave on men in Camp overcome with heat.<br/>A Route March organised by some fool of an Officer left Tel Kiber &amp;amp; some large number of men gave in &amp;amp; had to be conveyed by Ambulance to Hospital.<br/>Just heard that W.O. Little of the Aus. Base P.O. Alex. is dismissed &amp;amp; returning to Australia as an undesirable, owing to His shady transactions in connection with money matters.</p>
