The man himself was almost distracted through water supplies being short in his particular Corp, & his horse was so famished for drink that immediately he came on the sand & within range of the ocean he ran foward & drank immense quantities of the briny fluid.  During my brief stretch of writing this portion of my diary I was am compelled to seek hurried shelter from shrapnel fire which has been raking this beach throughout the day with dire results to a number of our lads.  Just as present moment a great rush is being made with trenching tools at renovating worn out dugouts.  A few casaulities casualties almost always awakes a few of the slumberers & makes quite active members of them for a few hours.  I am afraid my memory is a little deficient at present moment, probably the memory of shell fire has not quite gone out.  Once more peace & quietness reigns, but for how long?  I have an alnight job in the trenches tonight which I am looking foward to, as I consider the trenches more sheltered than our own particular camp.  The night was quiet, especially on our wing, & the trenches were given over entirely to the Sappers who had a busy night of it.
