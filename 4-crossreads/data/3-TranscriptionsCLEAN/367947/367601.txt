  
 Well old man thats' about all this time. I'll have such a lot to tell you when I come home that you'll wish it could have been your luck to come. However your job is at home as I've told you in most of my previous efforts. Things are looking bright for me in several ways. When I get back & if they do well both you & Ted will get the call. So in the meantime look well after Clare, the kiddies, & yourself with ever grateful love to you both from 
 Will.
