4th October. Weather still showery but shows signs of clearing up. Usual fatigue "working parties" out on the various jobs that we have in hand, I can tell you I have my work cut out of a morning getting them together for they are so scattered the new hands are not used to the game yet, it takes them a terrible long time to get ready, as for water they are always wanting it, they have not learned to control their thirst yet, all the old hands never touch water unless they absolutely need it a man is much better for it for you never know when the time may come when water is unprocurable you have to go without for 2 or 3 days (I have done it before today) that's when it hurts the heavy drinkers.
