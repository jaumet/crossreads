<p><u>Operations at Posieres, July 1916</u><br/>Diary gives an outline of doings up to 18 July 1916 at which time we were billeted at the town of Warloy-Baillon, an average-sized village crowded with troops belonging to the 1st Inf. Brigade.<br/>On Wednesday, 19 July, we were all day expecting orders to move so had things packed up &amp; simply remained on the qui vive. About midday I was delighted to see Rid coming along. He was down from his camp in the wood on the hill in order to buy some goods for his mess &amp; had been directed by one of our 2nd Bn. officers (DeWinton) to where I was. We only had a short time together but I was glad to hear from him that Leo was close by &amp; doing well.<br/>Having some idea of what might lie ahead this meeting with Rid was specially welcome &amp; it was not easy to shake hands &amp; see him trotting away (on shank's pony) to do his marketing. He seemed well &amp; in good spirits.</p>
