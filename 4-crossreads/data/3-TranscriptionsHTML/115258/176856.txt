No doubt they are proud wretches! their officers or this Sergt Major <s>whe</s>&nbsp;would not have anything to do with the other German soldiers even after they were captured. I dont know how they are able to keep it up so different from our officers - the next night it was a bit cold and I was on the phone and our major came along and asked me if I could keep warm and told me I had better sleep with him in a bit of a hole he had found out of the wind and share his blankets; but I did not do it as Ted &amp; I generally stick together on these stunts, but it is a pleasure to work with officers like ours who are just leaders &nbsp;and gentlemen. Am sending you a photo which I was not going to sned home as it is a bit gruesome, but thought you might like it to show the McCabe boys or other antis who would just as soon be under German as Brittish rule.</p>
