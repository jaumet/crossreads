<p>Jly 29  Rather warm the last few days. Query? Am I for Australia or Home Service? Have 2 to 11 pm pass &amp; came down by car about 2.30, but nothing doing at all. Just my luck. Scores of bathers in the Briny, including lots of our boys. Several 3rd Div men &amp; officers on the Prom. Turned the old Cady down for the first time; on a/c of the heat. (Weight 11-8, just about the same) Jolly nice tea, &amp; pictures weren't too bad. (9pm) Beautifully calm sea, &amp; quiet &amp; peaceful way down here on this end of the Prom. Just ahead is a Coastal boat</p>
