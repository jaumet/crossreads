<p>Rain &ndash; Heavy wind &amp; snowstorms. Camp duties. I went over through Ligny Thilloy &amp; down near to Factory Corner, looked well over what was No Mans Land in the middle of November &ndash; Many Australians still lay here unburied &ndash; I could not find any trace of the identification of Hubert O'Kelly, who I am sure fell just about there. My pal Les Bowden who was looking for a friend, had the very good fortune to identify him by some papers strewn, about, amongst which was a letter of his written to him, Pte Margery. Les discovered in burying him that he still had his wristlet watch on his arm which was under him. I have written to the Registrar of Graves asking him to recognize a cross I place in that vicinity to Hubert's memory, if no further particulars are offering about him.</p>
