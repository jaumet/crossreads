The walk had whetted our appetites & we thoroughly enjoyed the Steak & Bacon & other good things.  We had a rehearsal at 2, which went off well, our Pianist (Frank Newton) being in great form.  Had Tea at 4, plenty Bread & Butter & Cakes.  Then we commenced to make up for the Show, which was billed to start at 6.  As soon as the Doors were opened the crowd rushed in & we had a "Full House" in double quick time.  The show went off splendidly, everyone seemed to be at their Best.  Several items were encored.  The Sketch also took very well.  "Oriss" & Madame Melbum taking their parts to Perfection.  Billsy May took Payneys place & sung his two songs admirably.  The "Belle of N York" went off very well too.  After the Show, Mr Greenberg complimented us on the Show & said he never expected to see anything near as good.  He also gave us Hot Tea & Cakes, before we got aboard the Cars & returned to Olincourt.

We had Tea & then got ready for the Show.  Last night the acting Brigadier & about a dozen other officers were present & spoke very highly of our Show.  We got going at 6.30 & the crowd seemed to enjoy it even better that last night.  "Orris" was in great form, & his antics greatly amused  the crowd.  We finished about 9 & returned Home in the G.S. waggon, tired & happy. 
 Sat. 13.  Last night finished Letter to M.S. & posted it  We put our show on in the Mess Tent at night & the patients enjoyed it very much.  Tomorrow we are returning to "the Somme" & the crowd gave 3 hearty cheers for the Bearers.  It was read out in orders this morning that 8 of the
