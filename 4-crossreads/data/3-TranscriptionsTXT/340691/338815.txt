Absent.
Sometimes between long shadows on the grassThe little truant waves of sunlight passMy eyes grow dim with tenderness the whileThinking I see thee smile.And sometimes in the twilight gloom apartThe tall trees whisper heart whisper heart to heartThinking I hear thee call.
Because.
Because you come to me with naught save loveAnd hold my hand and lift mine eyes aboveA wider world of hope &amp; joy I seeBecause you come to me.Because you speak to me in accents sweetI find the roses waking round my feetAnd I am led through tears &amp; joy to theeBecause you speak to me.Because God made thee mine I'll cherish theeThrough light &amp; darkness &amp; all time to beAnd pray his love may make our love divineBecause God made thee mine.
God send you back to me.
Love you have left me weary and lonely.Sailing so far awayAh how I miss you- daily I'm prayingSafely you'll come home someday.Though we are parted- love lives for everWhen hearts are fond and true.So, till our meeting, let us rememberEver I pray for you.God send you back to me.Over the mighty seaDearest I want you nearGod dwells above one youKnows how I love youHe will bring you back to me
