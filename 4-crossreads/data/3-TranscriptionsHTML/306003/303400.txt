<p>21-6-16<br/>Wed 21st<br/>We left Romani at 2.30 this morning &amp; had a decent trip to Oghratina arriving at 8.30 &amp; made ourselves as comfortable as the heat would allow in the shade of the palms;  We are expecting a message all day from a scout aeroplane that went out this morning, but none came &amp; we received a message per phone at 5.30 saying the scout was missing &amp; another plane was coming out to look for her but only came as far as Qatia &amp; dropped a message to the N.Z. troops there saying she could not go further as it was getting too dark &amp; then went back to Romani for the night;  Today has been one of the hottest we have yet had<br/>The 3rd Regt is the advance party this time &amp; went on to Debabis this morning;  A good many lads have been going into hospital lately &amp; 8 were sent back to Romani with the Camel transports this evening</p>
