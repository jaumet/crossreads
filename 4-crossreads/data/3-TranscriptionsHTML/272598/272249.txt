<p>feeling fit &amp; well.  Have been having a good time in hospital also out of hospital.  Weather getting very cold, have to wrap up out of doors.  Have been over the cathedral which is very ancient &amp; most interesting.  Hope to have the good fortune to be able to remain here for Xmas.</p>
<p>Saturday 1 to Saturday 29.12.17<br/>Surprised that I have been allowed to remain here for so long still was extremely pleased to spend Xmas in such a fine place.  Marked out for furlough about 20th &amp; am now waiting for my papers to come through.  Xmas Day was a grand day</p>
