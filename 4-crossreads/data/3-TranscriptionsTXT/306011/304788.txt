Frid. 26th Oct. 1917:-
There have been plenty of taubes over latterly including last night which was fine & clear. Taking advantage of the moonlight went for a stroll down the road, over the frontier, and on to French territory. Have started to learn Flemish in earnest - it looks easier than French.
Tuesd. 30th Oct 1917:-
Fritz has been bombing our area like billyho the last few nights - London raids aren't in it (mere fleabites). So far our place has escaped scot free. The bombs are of a deadly nature - bursting all directions without penetrating downwards.
We have just had some very interesting news - leave to England has been increased from ten to fourteen days from 1st Nov. And about time too. There are crowds of chaps who haven't had leave for 18 months & some for two years. The heads are only just waking up and sending more on leave. The papers have been kicking up a fuss lately & this no doubt the result.
