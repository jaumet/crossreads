  
 1918 Tue.  1st Jan. At the conclusion of the programme they played the Hamburger "homeward-bound" song and all the Germans sang the chorus in very excited fashion, demanded an encore, and wildly cheered the strutting bantam-cock on the bridge. 
 The chorus went:-      "Holdrio, es geht nach Heimat.      "Holdrio, yur schonen Heimat.      "Holdrio, es geht nach Heimat,      "Holder-rie-ei-rie-ei-rie es gaht nach Haus'." 
 And musical snobs try to tell us that English popular songs are  so  inferior to the German and French. 
 Fri. 4th Jan Sail sighted 8 am, passed at 11.30.   Being neutral the vessel was passed, but a little later mein Herr Kommandant decided to sink her since "dead Neutrals tell no tales". I watched the chase from the port-hole, the full armament was swung on to the vessel and she surrendered.
