 Sent to you with best Love & Wishes 
 From Your Loving Sister & Nephew Flo & Roy Knight April 25th 1918 This is "Anzac Day" Dear Hec, the Day that will be well remembered in the History of this War. The Landing of our dear Lads in Galipoli & my Brother. This Day should be kept as a Sunday - to my mind.
