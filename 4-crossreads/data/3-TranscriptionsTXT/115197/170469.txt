  Feb. 9th  (Sunday) 
 Letters Home.&nbsp; London in Winter.&nbsp; An afternoon of exercise and amusement.&nbsp; Walk to Parliament in the Fields, which lies adjacent to Hampstead Heath - and there I witness ing  the delightful recreation of tobogganing for the first time. 
 Great sport.&nbsp; Many laughs!&nbsp; Return to Elm Bank and spend the evening reading aloud to Mr &amp; Mrs Scales.
