<p>[On letterhead of "The Young Men's Christian Association and the Australian Branch Red Cross, with H. M. Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in Egypt."]<br/>[From] P E Potts C.Q.M.S.<br/>954 [No.] C [Coy.] 19th [Batt.]<br/>[Brigade] 5th [Division] 2nd<br/>5/11/1915</p>
<p>Mrs A. W. Hill<br/>Kurraba Road<br/>Neutral Bay</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Hill</p>
<p>Tom met with a slight accident today. He was sitting in his dug out &amp; a piece of shell from some distance flew back &amp; hit him on the arm, &amp;  hip, causing a fair scar in both places. Happily however the wounds were not deep &amp; Tom bore up like a Briton. He of course will be obliged to rest for a few weeks but is in no danger whatever &amp; being physically fit should be back with us in the course of a month at the outside.<br/>I am cabling you tomorrow in case Tom hasn't a chance of doing so. The Military Authorities would naturally advise you of Tom being wounded &amp; you might think he is badly <u>"done by"</u>. &ndash; but on receipt of my cable you will see he is not too bad.<br/>Hope all is well with you &amp; yours<br/>With kind regards to Miss Hill<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>P E Potts</p>
<p>[Written sideways in the left-hand margin:]<br/>We will all be pleased to see old Tom back with us. If I told you all we think of him &ndash; you would be getting too proud. All I can say if there were more Tom Hills we would be over the Hills &amp; far away from this I'm sure</p>
