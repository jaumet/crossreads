<p>II<br/>don't think there can be any material change in the situation on Gallipoli since we left. I saw the cables from London of Septr 27/28th at Kenneth's Hospital about the fine advance made by the Allies on the Western front. The news certainly is most reassuring and should greatly relieve the pressure on the Russian front. It is to be hoped that a concerted movement will be made by our people to bring the business to a close this month or next and so avoid another Winter Campaign, because the latter although it will severely test the Hun's resources, will also be a severe financial drain on Britain, especially with the new War Loan at 5%<br/>Captain Millner who is D.A.Q.M.G. of our Division and a friend of the Fell's had a letter from Janet dated August 4th with a full description of the Australia Day Collection which certainly eclipses anything of the kind ever held before. It surely must have been a great day &ndash;<br/>II</p>
