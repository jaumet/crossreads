<p>Wednesday, 4.<br/>Received notice to pack up ready to leave for Harefield. Left by 1.22pm train from Aylesford for Charring Cross, London. Arrived 3.10pm. Thence to Commonwealth Bank, but no cable for me. Thence to Harefield. Arrived 6.30pm.</p>
<p>Thursday, 5.<br/>Commissariat etc. splendid. 7.pm notice of discharge to Salisbury Plains.</p>
<p>Friday, 6.<br/>10.30am Left by motor for Denham, thence through London to Salisbury Plains. Arrived Perham Downs (Luggershall) 5.30pm. The rottenest hole on earth.</p>
<p>Saturday, 7.<br/>Parades all day for new equipment, pay etc. One general parade to se a deserter---corporal---stripped of his chrevons. Charge and</p>
