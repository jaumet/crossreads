<p>1918<br/>Tue. 8th Oct.<br/>A day of trial and trouble.   I cursed and vanquished Limb, the wardrobe master, in the morning.   The pig tried to do me out of borrowing the best toilette in the English wardrobe, which I intended using at the Theatre Francais on Saturday.   Returning weary from the fray to our Officer's Mess (which is also the Officer's Dormitory, the Officer's Club-room &amp; the Officer's Kitchen all in one) I fought with my adorable Irish mess mate, who is getting more impossible everyday.  Then came "dinner" &ndash; the best the Captain could give us was a plate of thin soup &ndash; our store of food is almost exhausted.   I cursed the Kaiser, Lloyd George, the Food Branch of the Red Cross &amp; the world generally and then flopped down on my bed (a thing of unpainted wood which frequently becomes lousy) to mourn in solitude.   The bed collapsed beneath me.   I rose from the ruins and fled to a rehearsal to try and Forget.   (how tragic that looks.)   Here I met Nagle the International conductor, an American of sanguinary illegitimate parentage (to paraphrase my opinion of him).   To cap all, Directeur Darras <u>twice</u> stopped the performance to correct my French accent!   A sad day!</p>
