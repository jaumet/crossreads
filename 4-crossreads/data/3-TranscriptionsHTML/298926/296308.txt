<p>You can always see a minniwerfer shell coming. It weighs 100lbs and looks like a cigar <br/>in the air.  The trench mortars you can also see coming &amp; they look like an apple on <br/>a stick.<br/>The trenches here have to be built up with sand bags as the ground is very watery and <br/>any depth below 4? fills to that level with water.
