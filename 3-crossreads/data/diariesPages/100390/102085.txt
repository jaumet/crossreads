also my sketches in water ? oil Ive sent from time to time to you 
Now don't worry realize that Im not in a civilized country next to a P.O. in peace times but a wandering soldier in a disturbed one. 
Ill come thro alright. My Scots second sight tells me that youll see me home some day. 
All my fondest love to you all kisses for the dear kiddies
from Yours affectionately
Jack
Write occasionally. I got 2 letters from Mater ? Pater one from Dora since I left also about 5 altogether from Viva. I think many must have gone astray, however Ill be home soon tell you all the news better than cold paper pencil can.
