When-ever a strange bird ventures near their nest they dart out after it and unless it flees immediately a furious encounter takes place in which neither side is satisfied or will desist until one or other comes hurtling to the ground killed or hopelessly crippled. No doubt there is something hatching on these nests judging by the jealous manner in which they guard them.<br/>You could not imagine a more peaceful neighbourhood than this is at present.
