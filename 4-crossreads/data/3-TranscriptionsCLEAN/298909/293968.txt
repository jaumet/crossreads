  
 Tom O'Hagan telling me he was in Abyssia Hospital & had been ailing since December. 
 I put a very nice day in Ismailia, wrote a lot of letters & sent Eileen some things from (Dayanam Brothers - Merchants Ismailia). They are very particular about passes, I was stopped about a dozen times - more especially at the ferry. Got home about 9 pm.  Saw a lot of Turkish prisoners also wounded going through to Cairo from the engagement not far from here 22nd 23rd 24th. 
 The Tommies are not held in confidence by the Australians here  generally  & there is not the best of good feeling - rumour has it that only for the Australians the other day the Tommies would have been cut off - In Ismailia today an Australian had a few  laagers  in him & indulged in a bit of horse play. The M-P's ex London Police, Cold footers - took to them & got a hiding result - they went back, called out all the whole of MPs in Barracks armed to the teeth. If there had been a few more Australians I'm sure there would have been a battle royal.
