 Dear Frank A view of the beach from the [indecipherable] is not visible form here. Could see shells bursting day and night on Cape Tekke . note the dugouts, and stacks of stores. This southern part of Anzac is called Hells Spit and it is a very appropriate name. Drop a line sometimes please. Yours sincerely A Pyke
