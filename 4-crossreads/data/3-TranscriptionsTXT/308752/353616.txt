29th September 1918. (The Bellicourt Stunt, Hindenburg Line) to the 5th October 1918.At 7 p.m. the Bearers fall in & started on the road again, towards the Line closely following our Brigade. It was some march, I can assure you, at times the hostile shelling was very severe. Very often we advanced through our smoke [indecipherable], & our experiences were most trying at times. The net work of defences, such as barbed wire, trenches, concrete dugouts & strong points were to no avail, the Yanks got through these all right, & then the "Diggers" took a hand with the "box on" at Fritz.  Crowds of German prisoners could be seen coming our way from all directions, towards the rear of our Line. A jolly fine sight,  a sure sign that we are advancing still -    About 3 p.m. we formed a Relay Post in a Trench, but a Loading Post could not be formed on the road, as the road was receiving hell from Fritz & it meant certain death for our Ambulance Waggons to attempt to come through.  Naturally a great congestion of stretcher cases was the result, and to make matters worse it began to rain heavily.  Just before dark a Loading Post was formed, & we started off to carry the patients away. The carry was a long one, about two miles and only five squads available, so the task of getting away about 30 cases to the Waggons was a very hard one. The carry was a most delightful one - into trenches & over barbed wire, & very often in mud up to the knees.
