<p>4.10.1916   Again wet and miserable.  The same old complaint, mud over your boot tops  Everything quiet  during this weather.  Getting on slowly with our stables.  A number of men suffering from boils.  Weather too rough for aeroplanes.</p>
<p>5.10.1916   Bty is coming out of action in a day or two.  The weather is fine, and mild.  A few shell about the Bty.  One of our mules wounded at Lille gate last night.  This is a dangerous spot, swept by machine gun fire every night.</p>
<p>6.10.1916   Fine but cloudy Bty coming out of action tomorrow.  Shoeing Smith Heyden gone to Hospital, something wrong with his throat.  Tonight is windy and rough, Artillery active.</p>
<p>7.10.1916   A few isolated showers, with a fierce wind, Bty coming out tonight</p>
