<p>England &amp; I assure you that on each arrival home after a loving meeting with the &quot;best little girl&quot; in the world I go &amp; gaze on my testimonial &amp; &quot;think&quot;. It hangs in the room I usually go into first.</p>
<p>From this you will think me a sentimental old &quot;Shell back&quot; Well maybe I am but I am glad of it &amp; only hope I shall remain so until I am called away to join the ranks of all the brave fellows who have gone before.</p>
<p>Thanking you so much for your letter &amp; looking forward to meeting you on my arrival at Sydney, with kind regards</p>
<p>[I remain?]</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>RH Wynne</p>
