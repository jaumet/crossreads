24/7/17 Beaulincourt ? Aveluy
Reveille at 4.45 am. All up and out early and set to work striking the tents before breakfast. Coys. then marched out and piled arms on a hillside. Men then marched through and through by the officers picking and cleaning up all the rubbish until the ground where the camp had been was as bare as a board. It is marvellous what there always is left even after several preliminary goes at cleansing. Incinerators were roaring. At 7o'c the Battalion moved off and passed the starting point on the Bapaume - Peronne road. Our good friend the Scottish Colonel (Craig of the Highlanders) was there to shake our hands and we gave him an "eyes right". Moved from the Pumping station over through Ligny Thilloy which was occupied by the 2nd Pioneers. On one ruined shack was the legend "Pioneer Pub. Adams Ale". Another ramshackle place was the "Elite Theatre"with sheet iron painted like stage scenery. "Whale oil fag!"Came
