ammunition in is a terrible weight to carry when you are not used to carrying it. We are camped right close to the sea shore and we have a swim every day.
My word I have only been her six days but I have had my eyes opened to what the Officers and men must of suffered in there wanderings around the Desert. No body out there has any Idea what the Light Horse has gone through out here. Well the food out here is quite as good as anyone could expect it to be. We are off again tomorrow somewhere.
Well I hope everything is going alright at home. Let me know how my horses are looking when you write next. I got the two wires you sent for me to see, they made an awfull mess of it alright. Thank Olive for sending me those chocolates they where very welcome. Remember me to Tommy & Mrs Norrish and family. The pencil you send just came in right as I had lost mine somewhere. Have you heard what I got for my wool yet. Jack Norrish is away in Cairo at present.
Well what ever you do do not worry about me, as I will be alright. Well I must close with sending my best wishes to you all. Remember me to Birt & Mrs. Bilney also all old friends. Kind Regards to the Boss also George. Well I hope Nell is over staying with you before your recieve this letter. I must conclude with sending you my best love.
