<p>10:  Moved off again at daybreak, but were greeted by a heavy shelling from the enemy at Burka, so were forced to gallop for cover.  At 10 a.m. the 1st Bde. entered Ezdood a native mud village, which is well supplied with clear spring water.  The natives give grain to the wellkeeper in exchange for water, which of course was free to our men &amp; horses.  2nd &amp; 3rd  regts on patrol duty &amp; keeping in touch with the enemy at Burka.  The 52nd Div. (Scotties) Marched in at 5 p.m., after 3 days &amp; nights of continuous Marching, fighting two minor actions en route, on half issue rations.  Left at 6 p.m., going two miles up the wadi on outpost. At 9 p.m. the 52nd raided an enemy post, killing all hands, but had 5 killed &amp; 17 wounded in the stunt.</p>
<p>11:  After an uneventful night, we received orders to remain on the post until noon, when we returned to Ezdud &amp; drew our first ration issue since the 8th &amp; we soon made the scanty supply look sick; this being our first meal since tea on 8th.  No [indecipherable] to be had &amp; we have not had any since the 5th.  At 3 p.m. we moved off to Tel el Murra (6 miles) on reconnaissance, where we found a fresh water stream  12 ft deep &amp; about 40 ft wide, running into the Med. Sea from the hills.  At 7 p.m.</p>
