 19.2.19 Feeling off colour all night but better when woke up this morning. Up 8.30 am then went to a restaurant near YMCA for breakfast having Steak, Chips, Coffee and Buns for 45 cents. 
 Then went to Senate Offices to see Senator Colt but he was out, so went to Representatives Offices and saw Congressman La Guardia. Gave him the letter of introduction from Miss Dexter of E. 75th St, N.Y. so he gave me cards of admission to Senate and Representatives also letter to admit me to Bureau of Engravings, Smithsonian Institute and other places. 
 When coming back from La Guardia's office a burly chap yelled out to me "Hello Australian" and came up and spoke. His name is Garland a Congressman and he was over in France seeing the battlefields after the armistice. He told me to go to his office and see him if I wanted anything done. 
 Then called in again to see Colt but he was still out, so went back to YMCA and after reading the paper "Washington Post" got on a sight-seeing motor bus and drove all around the city, costing 1 dollar. Saw Edgar Allen Poes residence, Quincy Adams ditto, General Grants ditto, also residences of innumerable American notabilities. Also saw the White House, War Offices, Mint, Gallaries, Botanic Gardens, G.P.O., and all public buildings and points of interest.
