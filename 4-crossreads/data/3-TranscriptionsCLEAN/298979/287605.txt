Mounting the operating table the bandage was removed from the injured arm, & the wound examined, the patient stretched full length to receive the anesthetic, when having seen the result of the operation on the "youngster", this patient sat up and stated that no matter what was found in the arm, if anything, or what its condition was, the arm was not to be taken off.
A discussion thereupon arose which lasted fully fifteen minutes The patient was informed that he had there three of the finest (British) Doctors in France whose knowledge had been gained long since & every confidence could be given. If the arm was in a state that amputation was unnecessary it would no be interfered with, but as there was every indication that it was much worse than it looked they pressed for discretionary power to take off the arm if in their combined opinion its retention endangered the life.
The answer was. No matter what the consequences were likely to be, the arm must not come off!
The operating Doctor (who was also the Doctor of the Ward) then quietly appealed to the patient for trust in his knowledge & skill, and to let him decide during his operation as to what was best to be done, the arm would only be taken off if positively discovered to be inoperative.
Still the answer was. No! Further, sitting up the patient stated that he must ask each of the three Doctors to give their word of honor that no matter what condition the arm was in, or what the subsequent result might be, they must promise that the arm must not be amputated If this promise could not be given the patient would at once jump off the table & leave the theatre.
After repudiating all responsibility this promise was given & the operation was proceeded with.
After passing off into unconciousness
