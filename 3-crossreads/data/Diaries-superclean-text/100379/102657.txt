10th March 1917. Woke at 7 after a great sleep. Went on duty at 8 till 2. The Battalion HQR shifted their station from our dugout today leaving us on our pat. If old Fritz gets a footing here now we are gone to the woods. Anyhow its a good idea for us to be here alone as we can sleep right here. Fixed up sleeping messing quarters opposite telephone dugout Avenue. Fritz strafed tonight made it hot for a while. Went on duty at 12 till 4 and read Aust papers etc which came in by mail. Received letters from Rana Florrie.
