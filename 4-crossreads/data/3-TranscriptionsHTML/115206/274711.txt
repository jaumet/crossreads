<p>Bussy &ndash;la-Daours<br/>Wagon Lines for Battery.<br/>Weather fine. Did the 4 to 5.30 am on the phone. <br/>Fritz dropped four close to us at 11.30pm last night. Cleaned my harness, like a new set. Went for a swim with Ken .<br/>Wrote several letters in the evening whilst on shift, 10 to 12.30 am<br/>Burglar Lawrence and Abl Garfott arrived home from L'aison, at Vaire. <br/>Sent 50 francs to O.J. <br/>Saw a decent football match during the evening between "C" Battery and Q.R.H.A.</p>
