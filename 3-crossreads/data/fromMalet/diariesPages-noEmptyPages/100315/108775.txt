as left by the people in their hurried flight. Salvaged some clocks and all the deeds and registers of the Mairie and sent them back to our Transport Lines for Leon Barbier. A bright day. Walked round these pleasant open paddocks to see all the Corp. Everyone very tired as the guides lost them last night getting here. All the men feeling a bit better after a sleep and a wash. The Hun was shelling at intervals. A good view of Albert which means we are under observation. He did not shell this village today but Mellincourt was going up in flames smoke. Sent Stewart down to Transport and kept Sutherland here.
