very carefully, but unfortunately just as I was finishing, off she went scattered the phosphorous particles all over the place, well you talk about a stampede for there were a number of chaps watching the delicate operation, they fairly flew for their lives left me alone with the bomb blazing spluttering like mad, as quick as thought I unscrewed the vyce whipped her out, pitched the whole concern out in the mud where she burnt herself out after raising tremendous clouds of smoke fumes, I was just able to stamp the rest of it out before it set the whole billet alight, but I never got off "scot free oh no" some of the phosphorous caught on 2 of my fingers on the left hand burnt like H.. the only way I could get it out was by dipping the hand in mud, this killed the phosphorous but my fingers are badly burned blistered are very painful sore, but that is nothing, for I still have the bomb she is unspoilt, the boys all reckon one day I will blow myself up
