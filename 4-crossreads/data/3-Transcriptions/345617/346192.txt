<p>Septembre 27<br/>Our attack yesterday was very successful &ndash; inflicting heavy enemy casualties &amp; taking a lot of prisoners. Our Coy have suffered about 20 casualties &amp; 2 almost certain to succumb. Had to turn out again this afternoon &amp; go with a large party carrying material to the Front &amp; wiring. Heavy shelling during the day but quiet tonight.</p>
<p>Septembre 28<br/>Arrived back in camp about 6.30 a.m. after being out all night carrying material &amp; wiring. Tommies failed to get their objective on our Right &amp; in consequence our 15th Bde was cut up badly &amp; had to be relieved by our 8th. I think the Tommies were the 23rd Div.<br/>Had to turn out again this afternoon &amp; go with some [indecipherable] to the "Butt" to do some foreward work. L. Fisher of my Sec. was killed tonight.</p>
