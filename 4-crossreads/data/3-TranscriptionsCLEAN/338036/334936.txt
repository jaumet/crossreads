  
 VISIT TO HAZEBROUCK [17TH Aug. contd] which he was almost sure to take first thing in the morning.  He made a second trip but kept clear of Ballieul & presumably went to Hazebrouck. 
 Saturday 18th In the afternoon after we had finished our work Fred Cook [e] & I decided to have a run to Hazebrouck & with that intention we set out at 2.15 pm.  Walked to Ballieul obtained a lorry to Meteren.  Had the luck to strike an ambulance going to St Omer & had a bon ride thro Fletre, Caestre on to Sylvestre.  From there we got another lorry which took us right into Hazebrouck.  Saw the damage done by recent shelling & bombing.  In two instances two terraces of 3 houses had almost been demolished by shells (15 inch naval variety). 
 Thence to Railway Station after we had a look thro L'Eglise Notre Dame.  Saw some chaps from 2nd 1st & 5th Divisions flitting around.  The Hotel de Ville quite a treat to look at.  Forgot to mention that while at station the French Poilus leave train came thro' from Ypres.  Place seemed deserted & the people were quitting to the country on account of the shelling.  Just before leaving we had the unpleasant experience of seeing a couple of hundred refugees from Armentieres arrive with their belongings.  Armentieres was to be evacuated by civvies today
