 come up &amp; were closing in so as to cut off our retreat.  So the 2nd Brigade can think itself lucky to be still  able to  an active unit in the British army. 
 The retirement was a big thing &amp; the whole army retreated in a heap as it were.  Had to go a long way round &amp; rode all night reaching Belah at about 10 next morning, muddy, dusty, bloody, tired, sleepy &amp; hungry.  Perhaps if daylight had lasted another 2 or 3 hours Gaza would have been ours.  However we are nearly ready for another go for it &amp; this time I think we'll take it. It is a week since we attacked the last time &amp; a rough week mostly, as we have had to watch the movements of the enemy etc, while our army was resting &amp; getting ready for another fly. 
 Will write &amp; perhaps be able to give you details of a decided victory next time. 
 Lots of love to all From fond son Jack
