<p>I finish up this diary. I am still however perfectly confident of victory my only doubt being whether another Xmas will come &amp; go before the end, I sometimes fancy it will.<br/> For myself I don't care but for others &amp; the untold suffering still to come, my poor mother &amp; other fellows' mothers. What must they suffer? Whilst we, in our callousness perhaps getting stronger each day, let month after month go by &amp; are called heroes etc. get all the praise &amp; limelight whilst the mothers &amp; silent workers at home get nothing but the time to eat out their hearts with dread. Perhaps we get killed, who suffers most but the home folk. Personally I don't fear death for myself but for the effect it would have on those at home. Some might say that 'tis only conceit to think so but I can now realize something of my mother's love for one of her sons. I know this, that if it is my good fortune to return home safe after this war I will return home a better man than when I left &amp; I say this in all sincerity and a strong faith in the hereafter<br/>Harry E.
