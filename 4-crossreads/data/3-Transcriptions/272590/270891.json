<p>1919<br/>Sept. 3<br/>Badge.  The discharge was dated ahead so that I was still on leave for a couple of weeks.  After a short trip to Gunnedah at the Country's expense, I settled down to work again after war service lasting Three years and one day.</p>

<p>Two minutes' silence!<br/>Halt upon thy way,<br/>E'en if ye seldom bend the knee,<br/>In silence pray.<br/>Oh! how we prayed that peace might be,<br/>Oh! how we shouted victory!<br/>Te Deums rang throughout the land,<br/>A new, a glorious world we planned<br/>When strife was o'er &ndash;<br/>Lest we forget that sacred day,<br/>Two minutes' silence &ndash; halt and pray.</p>
<p>Jno. Wilson.</p>
