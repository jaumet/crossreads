<p>is under the charge of an Australian sister to whom I have since written. Of all the delightful houses I did not see one to surpass this one.</p>
<p>It was originally the residence of a wealthy Englishman who vacated it with his wife, and presented it with it's cost of upkeep to the British Govt. for use by wounded Tommies. The grounds surrounding the house are delightfully laid out and it is maintained sumptuously; we were fortunate in meeting Mrs Hurst who is the wife of the donor and she entertained us to tea at her new residence which is close at hand.</p>
<p>Left at 6 pm, and, after tea attended the second performance of the show at the Palace Theatre, commencing at 8-45 pm.</p>
<p>October 13th: -<br/>Went to the baths soon after breakfast and enjoyed the dip immensely.</p>
<p>At 12-30 pm, 3 of us caught the river steamer to Cowes on the Isle of Wight, which is a famous holiday resort. On this Isle are the magnificent homes of many of the English nobility and the place Cowes is a veritable paradise. A fine promenade extends around one front for 2 miles and when the regatta is held each year it is the parading place of the genuine Aristocracy who are generally in residence there when this event takes place. Visited the old home of Queen Victoria and caught the 6 pm steamer back.</p>
<p>Went to bed early to-night as we were very tired. Slept on deck.</p>
