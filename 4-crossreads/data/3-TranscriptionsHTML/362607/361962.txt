<p>This is just to tell you I will not be out tomorrow after till six o'clock if fine. I am invited to a party to help entertain wounded boys, it was to have been today but it is so wet &amp; they want to have it in the garden. I'm afraid you must have for awfully wet on Saturday night only hope you are none the worse. Kindness &amp; regards from us all .<br/>Yrs sincerely<br/>C.M.F.</p>
