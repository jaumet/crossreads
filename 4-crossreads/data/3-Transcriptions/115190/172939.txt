<p>pay for the sheep and fowls.&nbsp; My two hours are up at 5 pm &amp; after I shave wash boil the billy &amp; have tea &amp; groom &amp; feed the old mare, I am free until midnight.&nbsp; The horses are not getting enough to eat &amp; I forage in the village &amp; get my nose bags full of good chaff &amp; <sup>grain</sup>.&nbsp; The old mare gets a good feed that night &amp; is sure of one the next day.&nbsp; By this time I am regarding that mare as my dearest friend &amp; would rather starve myself than her.&nbsp; She has had all my spare biscuits &amp; doesnt she like them.&nbsp; She noses round my haversak like a child after lollies.&nbsp; At midnight my mate wakes me to go on duty.&nbsp; He tells me that there is no business doing at present, and he has blown the candle out as a sniper has fired two shots at it.&nbsp; Needless to say I do not&nbsp; rush over to the office and light</p>
