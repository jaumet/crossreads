 Saturday 22 December 1917 
 Dined at adjoining MESS &amp; in afternoon rode into Ismalia , the men here will have a good Xmas Turkey, Fruit, &amp; a bottle of Beer per man, sports on Boxing day. I spent one Xmas day returning from Gallipoli one Xmas day at El Arish &amp; this one I hope in comfort here. 
 Reinforcements have just marched in a lot of Boys, chiefly, all pass through this Training Requirement, &amp; do Musketry etc:-  the Cadre are changed every 3 months so if I get it I won't mind.
