H.Q. officers & asked to be allowed to take half one day & leave the others to follow. He did not say no & next morning I was
Thursday 25th Nov.up early & bundled as many boxes as I & Eltham & the Manchester chaps could. I found I had 50 cases on board. It was a rough & cold journey up to Suvla I felt perished & the spray dashed all over us. The sea was big I arrived at Anzac Pier about midday but as usual there was no one to help me & I had to transfer my boxes to the Horse Boat Barge & then when at Pier up on it. The M.L.O. there got some Infantry chaps to take the stuff off on to the Beach.
