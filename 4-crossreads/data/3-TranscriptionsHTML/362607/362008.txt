<p>2.12.17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>I have 3 letters of yours to answer but it has been too cold to sit away from the Fire today. It is alright when one keeps moving but sitting &amp; writing above all, is much too cold. I rode the bike into Salisbury yesterday &amp; it was lovely cycling home. The wind was behind me, the sky was cloudless &amp; a full moon was shining, We have had lovely weather &amp; today was perfect. Of course on the cool side but one must expect cool weather this time of the year. We are both O.K. Now I'll answer your letters later on in the week.   Love to All,  Harry.</p>
