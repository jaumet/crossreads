 Shopped &amp; pd. up Bills of Dollys &amp; danced in Hotel in evening. Fox trots &amp; only 2 one steps &amp; 1 Waltz. I'm not much good at the first &ndash; a splendid band &amp; good floor &amp; Dolly is a perfect little dancer, &amp; looks so pretty &amp; such a youngster, you would not think she was married. Raining &amp; snow. We get plenty of Tucker but one has to pay 100 &percnt; more for everything &amp; I could not keep up this pace.
