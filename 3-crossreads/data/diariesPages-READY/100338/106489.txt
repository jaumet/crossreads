All that remains of it is twelve tall columns which when seen from a distance seem to be the ruins of a very beautiful building, But when viewed closely it looks as if it had been started only a few years ago.

Another historical monument is the “Scott Monument" which is situated in Princess Street near the Princess Street Railway Station, It is a beautiful structure and was erected in 1840-44 at a cost of £16,000. In the centre of the structure under a canopy is a statue of Scott, and figures from the waverly novels occupy the various niches around the monument. After wandering around the town for a few hours after this, I took train to Dundee and arrived there at about 10pm, I stayed at the Overseas club for soldiers and sailors. The trip from Edinburgh to Dundee was, with the exception of the view of the Grand fleet as we crossed over the fourth-bridge much the same as the ride from London to Edinburgh, In fact all railway journeys are much the same, They all get monotonous
