At the Head of the valley was Snipers Ridge, from where the Turkish machine gun snipers were driven out with great difficulty, and above this ridge towered a big mountain called Rhododendron, which was a vantage point of observation for the enemy. 
 From the spot, where I was on guard, a glorious panorama spread out to view of the sea and the surrounding hills, and away in the distance lay the Salt Lake and Suvla Bay shimmering in the sun.  The ruins of the town of Little Anafarta were miles inland and a tall tower stood here for a while, but as it proved to be an observation post for the enemy it was shelled and brought down.  Near the Salt Lake were the Chocolate Hills  and  where I witnessed a heavy attack  there  one night.  It was a grand spectacle of skyrockets, flares bursting shells, burning scrub, and flashes of rifle fire;   and  one might have enjoyed it, if it were not for its awful meaning;  many a participant never saw the light of day again.  The Turks suffered heavily but the burning scrub impeded our advance, so the objective was not reached.
