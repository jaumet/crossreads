MARCH   FRIDAY 31   1916
If in this life you wish to win
And rise above the common chump,
Take off your coat & pitch right in,
Don't wait, lay hold, hang on, & hump.
 
It ain't no use to grumble & complain
Its just as cheap & easy to rejoice
When God sorts out the weather & sends rain
Why, rain's my choice
