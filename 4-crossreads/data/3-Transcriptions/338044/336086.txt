<p>Am well enough and put on duty in Dispensary   Position of honour ( I don't think)  Scrub floor each morning etc  &amp;  a few odd jobs. Have at last found a good berth. Sleep on floor of hospital. Ship's food is not of the best. Very poor &amp;  one longs for a good repast at "Scott's" or A.B.C.  Breaks my heart to just look at the officer's dining saloon, whilst we are herded below.</p>

<p>Speculations are rife as to our whereabouts or whether we are to call at Albany or Fremantle. All sorts of rumours are afloat  &amp; it is remarkable where they come from. It transpires that we are south of Albany about ninety miles &amp;  pass it during the night.</p>
