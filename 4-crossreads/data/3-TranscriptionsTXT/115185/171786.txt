3 - here. Gibson wants to get to the front - but I'm sure they wont let him go with one eye. He doesn't like the idea of army service corps but it's better than being in the Tanks.I think it would be harder to get Gibson transferred to N.S.W. troops than to get him a commission in army service corps here.Much loveDevoted daughterBetha
