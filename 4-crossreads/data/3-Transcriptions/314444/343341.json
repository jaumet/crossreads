<p>P.S.  I regret to say the "Bayard" is temporarily out of action not from any defect but because I am unable to obtain any 380 [lubricant] &ndash; my old stock being exhausted.<br/>I have thoroughly overhauled the working and functional parts and despite the rough and heavy handling to which the arm has been subjected find they are in excellent condition denoting surely enough the workmanship and class of material used.</p>
<p>Yrs.<br/>Claude Benson.<br/>Ye Gods.  It's exactly 12 mos today since I sailed from Pinkenba on this stunt.</p>
