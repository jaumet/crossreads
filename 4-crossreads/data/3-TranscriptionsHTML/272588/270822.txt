<p>Wednesday 25 December<br/>Xmas day passed quietly.  We had much to eat &amp; a little to drink, but everything was very orderly. As a matter of act, I have a touch of flu.</p>
<p>Thursday 26 December<br/>Joy! A return has been asked of all men who left Australia in 1915 &amp; C.O.'s have been warned to be prepared to lose these men at any moment. Admitted to Rest Station with flu.</p>
