<p>It is almost evident &ndash; to us &ndash; that the 'German propaganda' referred to, is simply the worded opinion expressed amongst ourselves.</p>
<p>It is a fact, that in every big advance, with the one exception of the Vimy Ridge, the Australian Divisions have taken their big share, and at every part of the line they have been put to, there has been increased activity on that front.</p>
