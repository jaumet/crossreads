Saturday Nov 9We heard today that all 1914 men are going home almost immediately. They will be back in Ausy by Christmas. There is not much to be done here so we should have a good time.Sunday Nov 10                                  Rumoured today that Germany had thrown in the towel. The boys are beginning to get excited. We have now built an open, oven kitchen & mess hut so are living under decent conditions for this country. All hands are looking forward to the day when we start for Ausy.
