<p>work, we do at night. We have not Enteric fever here to any extent &ndash; not like Sth Africa. This is a matter we ought to be thankful for. Just think what it would mean if an infectious disease broke out in the little "plot" we occupy. It would be worse than the Germans' gas, which we have not had a taste of yet.</p>
<p>We have just finished a rest, which we enjoy in a sheltered gully, but fortunately we have no bother about getting a "locum". I hope when this reaches you, that yourself &amp; the Drs are in good health. I will finish my short note with thanks for your kindly interest in patriotism's cause for much good can be done at home as well as abroad.</p>
<p>I Remain<br/>Yours Gratefully,<br/>Clem Walsh</p>
