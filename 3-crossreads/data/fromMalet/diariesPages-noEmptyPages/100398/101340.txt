Steaming WNW at dusk. Sea like a mirror. Parade 6.30 – 7am. 9.30 -11 am (lecture Lt Bruce on field engineering, bombs & grenades very interesting – wonder why we are not taught more about other arms & explosive which we must use the little pea shooter?
Afternoon parade 3 to 4p.m. a very imposing affair.- All hands stripped & standing round – fighting one another – under the salt water faucett. Our canteen can only sell lemonade’ cigarettes & tinned fish. Tobacco & matches are ‘non est.’ Also, all fresh water being barred except a small quantity for drinking only, it has now become a crime to shave. All from Commandant down go unshaven & look pretty rough. This is the result of orders issued on day of departure.
