<p>Sunday<br/> May 18th at Sea</p>
<p>Church in morning on deck : calm &amp; warm day</p>
<p>Monday May 19th at Sea</p>
<p>calm &amp; warm : plenty of flying fish about now also a few sharks : concert at night</p>
<p>Tuesday May 20th at Sea</p>
<p>calm &amp; warm : hard work trying to keep cool &amp; I reckon we'll feel our Aussie summer for a while : passed plenty of jellyfish of a purplish hue with a pink Sail set up which caught the wind &amp; thus provided the means of propulsion : pretty to look at : inoculated for "flu" : dance at night</p>
