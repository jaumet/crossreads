<p>Aug 31.  Picquet changed at 10 A.M. &amp; I had the rest of the day to myself, <strike>and woke</strike> writing in the morning &amp; walking to St. Omer in the afternoon.</p>
<p>We had a bright &amp; merry evening in the billet during the evening hours.</p>
<p>September 1.    Another day in the wood.   We had quite a picnic there, very little drill and plenty of blackberries.</p>
<p>Fellowship meeting in evening.</p>
<p>Sept.  2.   Church Parade in morning.</p>
<p>After lunch I walked through Renescure (5 K.) to Ebblinghem (3K.) and thence to Blaringhem (5.2K.)   At the latter town I had tea of four fried eggs &amp; coffee.   During the trip I visited two churches and found the pictures especially, rather interesting.   The various interpretations of the "Stations of the Cross" by different artists are rather quaint (to the non-conformist mind, at any rate.).</p>
<p>I called to see Jack Rew at Ebblinghem on</p>
