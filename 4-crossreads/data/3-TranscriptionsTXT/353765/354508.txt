 May 1915 24th - Undermined &amp; Turks given 24 hrs to surrender. (25th only Rumour) [Note in margin:] H.M.S "Triumph" sunk by torpedo. 25th &ndash; All on Fatigue in morning fixing fireplace for cookhouse &amp; getting brambles for burning. Finished Dug-out today. Rained fro time in afternoon. Most &amp; heaviest so far. Battleship HMS "Triumph" torpedoed by German subm. just off beach. Sank in 35 minutes. Saw her turned over &amp; boilers burst. Looked as if she was firing to the last. Turned on her starboard &reg; side for about 20 minutes then slowly sank. All tugs out to rescue of crew. Destroyers flying round trying to ram or locate submarine. Could not &amp; submarine evidently escaped. Triumph was an old battleship &amp; came from China seas to Mediterranean after Kia-chau fell. Third visit of submarine first time she scored. Destroyer (or Triumph) missed her when firing. Triumph only about 2 miles distant from us. Big crowd [Note in margin:] X Bob Thomson  &amp;   25th &ndash; watching her when Turks sent shrapnel at us. As usual missed &amp; no one hurt. Tugs etc. also shelled by shrapnel, apparently from fort (Kilid Bahr). Triumph sank about 12.30pm. During afternoon piece of shrapnel shell (ring of nose) flew between half a dozen of us missing us by less than a foot, just brushing past Eddie Miles' nose &amp; Pat Kelly's head.
