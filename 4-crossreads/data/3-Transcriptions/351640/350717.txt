<p>playing parts honorable to themselves and doing credit to their education &amp; their educators.  Mrs. Deery has won for herself a good name, but in all probability there was in her home not strict enough discipline, which must at all times insist upon a correct line of action in the affairs personal and public of each moment.  Kelty, Kirkland, and others have chosen a first-class ship in which to travel to <strike>Adelaide</strike> Tasmania.  Mr. Andersons paper has not yet come.  Mr. Macdonald was very good to take you and Marie to the pictures.  Please convey to him &amp;amp' Mr. Vallon and their families my best wishes and kindest regards.  The mountains would bring a bloom to our Caggies cheeks.  Caggie is a sweet girl, of the best, or as the French say Une Ange.  You note that my reading just now is a novel in french.  Yes the care of myself is of the first order.  Your thoughts and prayers will avail me much.  Give my love to Maria, &amp; say may Fortune smile her best upon her now and always.</p>

He owes Mr Holman more than he can ever repay, but since words have been written 'tis the person who has received most <strike>who</strike> that is likely to kick the giver.  Holman is the best of friends but a poor personal enemy.</p>
