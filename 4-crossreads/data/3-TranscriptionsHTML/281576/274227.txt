<p>Saturday May 26  Got up about 8 &amp; went out quite early.  Had a shave.  Then I put my things together &amp; prepared to go to Stone.  Bunny &amp; Snowy came down to Euston with me &amp; saw me on to the Train.  Arrived Stafford 4 p.m.  Caught Train to Stone at 4.50.  Arrived Stone about 5.30.  Saw Jem. Starkey &amp; Topper Wooley on Station.  Didn't seem altered a bit.  Went to Crown &amp; Anchor.  It was great to be under the old Thatch one more.  Looked into Unicorn Hotel.  Saw Ernest Jackson &amp; had a great old yarn.  He's got awfully fat.  Just as left his shop met Mr Blakeman.  He would have me return then &amp; there with him, so I went back to Shirleywich with him.  Frank met us with the Float. He has grown into a big chap.  Ruth &amp; Mrs B. very pleased to see me.</p>
<p>Mrs B looks quite an old Lady.  The Shock of John's death must have affected her very much.  Mr B. looks quite well.  Much better than I expected.  Ruth has grown into quite a woman.  Jolly fine woman, too.  John's wife looks very well.  His son Alec is a bright bonnie kid.  His Grandma &amp; Grandma think the world of him.  They made quite fuss of me.  Put me in such a lovely big room to sleep.  There were all kinds of Girls nick nacks hanging around &amp; it made me feel quite Homesick.  Felt lost without pyjamas.  Slept soundly &amp; peacefully.  Made me think quite a lot of M.S.  Bless Her.  Actually said my Prayers.  First time for years.</p>
