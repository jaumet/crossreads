Reveille as per usual
At 0735 a plane was reported approaching our lines from the direction of Katia 5 minutes later they said it was hostile, she came over the 155th brigade then across us on to Hill 40, Petresium Kantare. She came back again hiving over us for a deuce of a time our anti aircraft gun had a go at her but it fell short the plane came round again flew over El Maler, not one of ours to be seen until she got well over Katia when two war planes were here up at a deuce of a height.
Bed 9 oclock, on a stunt tomorrow night.
