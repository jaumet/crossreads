<p>for us lately but so far on a whole our company has been very fortunate.  I had the bad luck to loose my mate the other day, he got a nice Blighty right on the knee but he is better off than us &amp; is sure to get to England with it.  I wouldent mind being in his place anyway his name is Frank Bailey, comes from Armidale &amp; was one of our Corporals coming over on board</p>
