<p>6: Left Arish 8 a.m., camping at Gowaiid for the night; leaving for Rafa at 9 a.m. next day; had lunch in the field where the action took place last Jany.  Took the opportunity during the halt to visit Robinson's grave.  Many wooden crosses marked the resting places of those who fell in that action &amp; the graves have been well looked after by the boys.  Pushed on to Khan Unis &ndash; native village, the first we have seen in Palestine. Well cultivated country, almond &amp; fig trees in abundance.  Camped here on the night of the 8th, being 9 miles from Gaza.  Planes over all night watching for Taubes but nothing sensational occurred.</p>
<p>9:  Went to the village, which is fairly clean, but inhabitants very cheeky to our men.  Saw ruins of chapel built by Richard Coeur de Lion in 1165; fine Gothic archway &amp; specimens of masonry on outside walls.  Taubes bombed Rafa 5 a.m., killing 7 &amp; wounding 28.  Anti guns have now been brought up &amp; manage to annoy enemy planes.</p>
<p>12:  Left Khan Unis at noon on outpost at Tel el Gemmi, being able to get a good view of position at Gaza.</p>
<p>13:  Stand to at 3 a.m., leaving at dusk for Khan Unis, just settling down when enemy shelled our hospitals, dumps &amp; railhead  at Bela, killing 7 &amp; wounding 23 troops.</p>
