 Ballad of Waney's Desperate Doings 
 Now Waney's an Australian, an Australian to the core The fighting blood  is in him &amp; he comes to every war Now 'twas some where in Egypt that this desperado strayed In fact I rather fancy he was 'on leave' in Port Said. 
 In a quiet secluded village, I think they call it Arab town Where French damsels of ill virtue, &amp; picquets hunt you down Old Waney wandered slyly carrying quite a dozen beers Till the cry of "Help us Aussie" made him prick up both his ears And girding up his loin cloth like Horatios of old With blue mettle in his pockets advanced with mien so bold 
 Now this awe inspiring spectre would the boldest man appal For there stood three Light Horse men with their backs against a wall And facing them two Gippos with their wives &amp; several sons Were forcibly demanding payment for some current buns
