<p>There were under fifty men in our trench, and here were hundreds coming to attack us.&nbsp; Nothing short of a miracle could save us.&nbsp; We only had about two officers left, the others had all fallen early in the attack, among whom was our Commanding Officer and leader - Captain L.L.Smith -.</p>
