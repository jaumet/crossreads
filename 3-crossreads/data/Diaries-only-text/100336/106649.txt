I suggest that the Preface be cut down to about this length some parts omitted might be embodied in the work proper.
Preface
During the first few months of my captivity the idea suggested itself of writing an account of the submarine A E 2. from the time of her construction until the day when she settled down to the bottom of the Sea of Marmora, 300 feet in 50 fathoms of water. She had been my home I missed her.
I also kept an accurate, a minute account of my prison life in Turkey up to the end of January 1916, when I was transferred to the Taurus Mountains section of the Bagdad Railway.
Having served a sentence of "Three years Hard" in that locality, "doing time" on the construction of twelve tunnels, I am in a good position to give first hand information on this section of the Baghdad line, which has been the subject of much speculation. Our work there helped to make possible that highway on which the traveller who boards the "Rapide" at Calais can travel through by rail to Luxor, only leaving the train to cross from Constantinople to Scutari by ferry.
