 16.3.19 Dear Dad, This is the Isle of Man as I've seen it many time of course it has its winter coat on now  &amp; looks rather ragged  &amp; out of work. Am assistant in every Department while I am staying with Auntie but I have to be very sly, because my Cousin is a very independent little soul  &amp;  asks no help at all. I have to do everything such as make my bed, lay the table, clean the Knives before she can get at the jobs because she is also wilful   &amp; would not let me do the thing then. Of course there is no need to do anything but we have been brought up to be helpful   &amp; of use in the Home &amp; it is not pleasant to me to sit down  &amp; be waited on by ones who are so good &amp;  kind. Uncle Rodger has just come in. He is very like you in His ways. We will be able to tell you better when we are Home to note the things that you do. He is always pottering about in Aunties way while she is cooking.
