engaged digging out a trench. Walked through the posts right down to the bank of the River Lys, the ground is marshy. Back to the Coy H.Q. and then out across to Posts 1 2 near and saw them all there. Returned to Bn HQ via Rodda at Iron Gate and turned in for a little sleep. Had a few visitors during the afternoon managed to keep busy. Major Crowther was in. Arranged a bombardment of the Spinney by our Stokes Mortars. The 34th shot a Hun this morning and captured another alive. It looks as if they had lost their way on patrol and got into our wire. At 9 pm left with Smith Thewles for the front line. To Iron Gate first and there saw Rodda and yarned for a while, then continued on to
