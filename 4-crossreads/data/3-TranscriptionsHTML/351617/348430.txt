<p>wardrobe on that trip down</p>
<p>We detrained about 8 kilometres from Samer at 10.45 pm and were put into motor-busses to complete the journey arriving at our destination at 1 am cold as frogs and hungry as hunters. However the Cooks had gone on a day before and had a good feed of hot stew waiting when we landed and an ant couldn't have got a feed after we had done.</p>
<p>Samer itself was not such a bad place but like all the small french town there was nothing to fill in time with. Some days we would go into an estaminet and have a game of French billiards but they closed at 2 pm so we were kicked out. Sometimes we would start off and walk for miles to surrounding Villages and have a look round and land home again in time</p>
