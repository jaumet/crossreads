<p>the month.&nbsp; At noon we are lying due west from Cape St. Vincent.</p>
<p>Punching balls, gloves &amp; medicine balls introduced.&nbsp; The weather hotter &amp; finer and the sea a good deal calmer.</p>
<p>Favourable winds prove most welcome.</p>
<p>During the day I read &amp; much enjoy<s>s</s> &quot;Echoes of the War&quot; (J.M. Barrie).</p>
<p>Recite at a &quot;Sing Song&quot; on &quot;A&quot; Deck.</p>
