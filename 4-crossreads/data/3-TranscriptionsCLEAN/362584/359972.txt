  
 At Sea Cloudy morning 
 My dear mater, 
 The longer I sit & ruminate, the more clearly do I realize how lucky I am to have such a mother as you. If there is anything which could possibly make me more comfortable than I am at present, it must be unknown to the civilized world. I never knew the luxury of a sponge till I came aboard this ship, - whose name, by the way, I am not allowed to mention -, but were it not for the one I have, my morning bath would be an uncomfortable necessity instead of a pleasant initiation to a day of monotony. Really I think that they ought to give you the job of supplying comforts to the whole British Army. 
 You will notice that the nearer we get to the bottom of the page, the more rotten my writing becomes. That is because the table is so narrow that the bottom of the writing pad overlaps
