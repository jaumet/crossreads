<p>September 1918.<br/>Thursday 26</p>
<p>Waggon Line and Tincourt<br/>Weather glorious fine and clear. Spent morning cleaning up phones and overhauling wire. Have every reason to believe that we shall be in action tonight.<br/>Packed up kit and left with wagons for new W.L. near Tincourt, by the railway line. Seems quite civilised to hear the trains again. Arrive new W.L. at 9.30 pm and rigged up a tarpaulin for the night.<br/>Rained during the evening not very hard, Met [indecipherable] Mosely and Don Cooker also Gus Knox.\</p>
