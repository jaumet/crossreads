  
 1918 27 Aug too slow for Capt Zander so he got up on top telling  us to follow him, 5.9 shells bursting around us all the time. I was puffed out and so was Don, and the first trench we came to, we hopped in and stopped to get our breath. Zander went on. When we regained our breath we walked along the trench till we came to a cross trench. Some of our Company were on the other side. They yelled to us to run across the cross trench as Fritz was firing straight down it. We found another trench and went up it, shortly coming onto the Fritz who had been shot through the neck by one of our men. He had tried to bandage himself up, but without effect, and was lying back looking exceedingly dead and white. I got his pocket book but there was nothing much in it. I took his pay book as a souvenir, but threw it away again, as I thought I might get captured and it would not look well. We got up to some old stables
