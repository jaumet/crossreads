3/9/18 Haut-Allines
devil. Crossed over to Greene and found him dug into a canal bank and well looked down into by the Boche. All the men tired out and asking for relief. Not much stuff flying round. Haut Allines village is a mass of ruins. Our chaps are taking too many prisoners lately they want to kill more. We are getting plenty of men killed they avoid it by surrendering. Returned to Bn H.Q. at 1 pm. The Tommies on our left carried out a peaceful penetration stunt this afternoon pushing out patrols with platoons advancing after them. The rest of the day and evening was moderately quiet but the Boche pumped over a large amount of sneezing gas which seems now to be often enclosed in H.E. shells. QM Miles was up here later in the evening. Our searchlights and the Boche's searching for aircraft are pretty.
