<p>In Action Flers 20/11/16 The men out digging the next trench in No Mans Land had a rather exciting time but working in the shell holes they managed to avoid casualties.  The enemy evidently thought we were coming at him and sent up a cluster rocket and opened a barrage behind the portion affected and kept it up for 15 minutes.  Otherwise the night was a comparatively quiet one.  The new men and their officers were all busily engaged groping round and trying to make themselves at home.  Stayed awake all night but managed to get a little sleep from 6 until 10 o'clock when liaison officers in distress commenced to drift in upon us having had great trouble in finding their bearings.  One was an English chap and his disturbed tones and general out of place appearance would have been comical if the whole thing had not been so tragic.  This morning men went out collecting water from the shell-holes and we found it fairly good but impregnated with chemicals &ndash;phosphorous etc.  So much explosive has been pumped into the ridge opposite that all water drained therefrom is all tainted in taste and a little unpalatable.  A Bosche shell landed on top of our dugout and the concussion put out all our candles.  In the front line a piece of shell caught one of the runners just above the heart and left him very sore.  The spirited lad stuck it out without complaint.  They are all dags.  "David" is one of the leaders of them.  Heavy cannonade about 7 pm.  Mud awful and dreadfully sticky just like glue.  A man pinked just through the arm and dressed in this dugout.  Huns belting hell into our old tank and making it decidedly warm round there.  Only just putting ones head outside the door is sufficient to ensure getting quite a mud bath.  Attempted to scrape mud off boots with a knife.  Clothes quite stiff with mud both inside and out and I am most horribly lousy and creepy all over the [indecipherable]</p>
