<p>2.<br/>Those instructions have not come yet but I am expecting them this week. The course here ends on the 5th Feb &amp; if I do not hear by about the end of the month I shall write. If it is necessary I shall not mind going to my battalion (which is at Cleethorpes on the East Coast just S. of Grimsby) for a while, but I do not think I would be capable or desirous of continuing with the infantry work. I am however hopeful of being given a chance in the Flying Corps when I want it. In my next letter I should have some real flying news.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you have again got into touch with Arthur. The postal system between <u>England</u> &amp; the A.I.F. is very unsatisfactory. I have written to Arthur &amp; Caesar &amp; several others but have heard nothing yet from them even after an interval of a couple of months. I cannot tell whether they have received my letters yet.</p>
<p>The weather lately has improved very much &amp; the days are quite appreciably longer. We have been spending practically every day out in the field reconnoitring &amp; carrying out schemes of attach, defence, trench fighting etc. it is certainly a very healthy life &amp; I am feeling generally better for it. Tomorrow night we go out on a night march by compass: it should be interesting.</p>
<p>Tonight, as usual, we have a lecture at 8.30 &amp; I am taking advantage of the interval between 6.30 dinner &amp; that to get some writing done for the mail on Friday.</p>
<p>Will stop now &amp; hope to have more interesting material for the next letter.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; yourself</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely</p>
<p>L. Whitfeld</p>
