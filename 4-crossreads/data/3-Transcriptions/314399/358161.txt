<p>Friday 13 June 1919<br/>Nice &amp; bright this morning. Quite a change from yesterday. Still taking medicine to clear my stomach. Went to Stephens Ship Building Yard at Linthouse in the afternoon with Ernest's brother in tow. Went all over the place &amp; enjoyed it immensely. Saw a boat almost ready for launching. another just started. Keel only being laid. Another with just the ribs on &amp; a torpedo boat launched &amp; to be finished at the end of the month. Went over all the workings too. Took Alice &amp; Ernest to a show in town. It was very poor tho. Real fine day all day.</p>
<p>Saturday 14 June 1919<br/>Took the two kids into the station to meet Janet. She turned up at 11.30 am so went shopping &amp; then out to Alices place for lunch. After lunch we went to a friend of Janets. Caught the 6.30 pm train to Gourock &amp; then the boat to Stroue. The lochs here are very pretty. the whole place is much like Sydney if it only got plenty of sun. We arrived here at 9 pm. Had supper a walk &amp; went to bed. Met all the family. They are very nice.</p>
