<p>30 June, Monday.</p>
<p>F.<br/>Finish my Cape Town Story. Go to English class on Figures of speech. Sea much calmer &amp; lots of small birds about. I go in sweep on mileage but lose horribly. I play my game of Cribbage &amp; win. Work right up till 8 pm bath, write &amp; go to bed. It was cold &amp; rainy &amp; I had to get up at 3 am to close Port Hole.</p>
