  
 last stint I had uncanny luck, in the final stages of taking the village I was working along with 6 men & a machine gun opened up on us killing 4 wounding 1, had my breeches clipped & beat it for cover narrowest squeak I have ever had. Then again had my Coy Hqrs blown in twice with heavy shells. I am hoping this run of luck keeps up. Things are very mixed on the Western front now we are pushing him all along, he is fighting desperately
