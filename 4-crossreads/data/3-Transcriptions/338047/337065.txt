<p>1919<br/>July 14<br/>debating society.  The first debate was &ndash; Compulsory Military Service.  It was held before the pictures started.  It was too chilly at nights to hold them on deck so they were shown on the mess deck.</p>
<p>July 15<br/>On 15 July we saw the Southern Cross for the first time.  The boys gave it a cheer at the thought of getting south again.</p>
<p>July 16<br/>On 16 July we crossed the line at 7 pm.  The ceremony was held in the afternoon, but unfortunately I was asleep &amp; missed it.</p>
<p>July 17<br/>On the night of 17 July there was a great amount of phosphorescence in the water.  The propellers seemed to be churning up fire, &amp; the wake of the vessel could be seen shining for 150 yards or so.  All the time that I was in England, I had religiously kept off meat, &amp; my boils had all disappeared.  On the voyage I started to eat meat again with the result that I found some hard lumps forming under my chin &amp; jaw.<br/>[Photograph of an orchestra on deck]</p>
