<p>3<br/>handwriting I did not know and even after opening both &amp; finding each to contain chocolate I was still guessing &ndash; until tucked away in the wrapping I discovered the two cards which I enclose.</p>
<p>Thank you very much &ndash; it is awfully kind of you to send me all these things. Fortunately for my health, everyone else in our mess likes chocolate. I open the stuff and as long as it lies on the table I eat it. I should certainly be ill if someone didn't enter into the argument and spoil the look of portion of it. Where sweets are concerned I have no will power I am afraid.</p>
<p>I am glad we're getting out of this place. I am getting to hate these Jews more and more. I think a general massacre is really the only thing for them. I told "some of them off" in the best Regimental Sergeant-Major style a few days ago &amp; have been feeling better since.</p>
<p>They held a two nights concert here some time ago "for the needy sick of the village". Three days ago I was asked to see a case of suspected typhus. It was a young girl of 17 or 18, &amp; she certainly was pretty ill. I didn't think she had typhus but as I have forgotten what I learned about Medicine that goes for nothing. At any rate the civilian doctor was taking no chances &amp; wouldn't see her, &amp; no one</p>
