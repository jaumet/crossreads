8/10/17 Broodseinde Ridge
The evening was very quiet except for a rattle of musketry and some bombing on our right. Again as on the 4th my nerves broke out ? a trembling set in ? quite involuntary. The rain has made conditions terrible. It is like flogging a dead horse to get anything done by runners or others. They take the message and soon turn up saying they cannot find the place or some other lie. The men are done, absolutely done finished. Poor Bunning tonight was well out to it. There were a few shells very close here we had our candles put out more than once. The evening was quiet except for a rifle and bombing stunt on the right evidently a German raid of some kind. Just before midnight Stewart Rodda and Savage went forward to lay out the J.O.Ts a risky job. As our barrage commences behind our own front line it will be necessary to bring all our men well back to jump them off. My task is to make two strong posts and attack with a battalion 90 strong on a 500? front!!!
