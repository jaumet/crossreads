June, 1915Thursday 17I have seen the 3.4.5 Infantry Brigades go & now the 6th is camped opposite & we wake to their Bands in the morning & all the Arab Hawkers & Small Shops are doing good business again.X Two Letter Cards from May I note she is at home now, I am very glad -X Ralph Arnold has not been near me since weeks ago I took his photo & he camps only 200 yards away, but perhaps he feels I am an Officer & he a Trooper.Also got a letter from Percy Smith Millawa, bad time on the Murrumbidgee with drought.
