Wednesday 13 June 1917.
Sea a lot calmer this morning and we will soon be in the Gulf of Aden.
Two boats - 1 tramp & 1 liner passed us going in direction of Colombo at 6.30 a.m. 2 sharks 12 feet long following boat with a dozen or so smaller ones. Several whales seen some distance away at 9 a.m. One came up on surface & was plainly seen. All were spouting. Flying fish were being chased by ("Beeneta") (Dolfins) fish [Bonita]. These (Beeneta) (Dolfins) are as long as 5 feet and of a bluish green color. They can swim very fast.
At 6.30 pm a large shoal of porpoises was seen close to boat. In early hours of tomorrow morning we pass Aden. 2 boxing contests this afternoon. Heat very great & atmosphere moist & very oppressive.
