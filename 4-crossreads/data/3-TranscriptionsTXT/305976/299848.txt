Some of us are civilised.Arrived Sydney 1pm. Home once again. Had a pleasant re-union old friends.Sunday April 8thWent to Manly Glad. One did not think he would see our dear old Arbour so soon again.Monday April 9thWent to Easter show, great crowd present. Does not seem as if there is a War on. However much better to be cheerful & miserable. Hate idea of saying Good Bye again. Left for Melbourne 7.15pm. Bidding Goodbye I will never forget. Never will I come to Sydney again on leave again. The old Lady takes it too much to heart. Whatever comes or goes the memory of this night will live forever.
