<p>26 May 1916<br/>Dear Beatrice<br/>Just a few lines to say all is well.<br/>I cannot say what my address will be in the near future.<br/>Have not had letters from any of you for ages<br/>The constant movement from one place to another must have put postal arrangements out.<br/>I have directed them at this end to deliver my letters care of my O.C. but still no letters.<br/>Am living in hope of better times and more pay for your sake.<br/>Keep well and happy and don't let the children</p>
