back in time for dinner. A friend of the family gives us plenty of music &  the evening passes very pleasantly  There is one thing that will never be replaced in my feelings  & that is music. How it brings back memories of home  This is the first time for a long time that I have become moody & thinking of home  & who can wonder after a fellow has spent nine months in nigger Egypt to once again  be amongst the good old English houses again listening to my own songs. The first time I have been    within an English home since leaving Australia. My fight with this cold has absolutely got me knocked right out, there are no two ways of putting it & by jove only for my holding out against it, would be down now. Having got rid of the cold (or nearly so) but feel pretty week &  good hot lemon &
