<p>1918<br/>Thu. 7th Feb.<br/>Quite an eventful day.   We are to move to the prisoner's hospital aft today;  all prisoners, including neutrals are to be spaced within nos 3 and 3 holds, presumably to enable them to be more easily spurlos versenkt if "Wolf" is caught.   The weather is icy.</p>
<p>We are just in the Atlantic circle;   the vessel is coated in ice, drift &ndash;ice is floating here and there on the lead- coloured swell.</p>
<p>Since I was along aft such a length of time has elapsed that it is quite a novelty.</p>
<p>The place is now indescribably filthy, a large proportion of the prisoners have scurvy and yet the morale is much more cheerful than it was.   Everybody is quite sure they are going to the bottom sooner or later (probably sooner) and they are quite fatalistic and cheerful about it.</p>
<p>The fashions in apparel have also changed.</p>
