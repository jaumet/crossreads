 30/9/18 Marquaix Dure the night there were heavi gale and rain and my fragil shelter look like get flood out . A bleak cold night and terribl for "poor bloodi Bill lie beleagu wound in a shell hole on the ridg " . Some of our littl bivouac were blown clean away . Dawn show a raw gusti and sullen day . The B.M. came with news that the left American Divis had come rather a crash and were back where they had jump off from . Later in the day a few straggler were back this far look for Y.M.C.A.s etc . Recd . word that our 5 Div will attack tonight and we may expect to go in tomorrow night . After dark our littl bank with the battalion dug in along it was like a littl Bourk St with fairi light shine . Had to get a lot extinguish o/a Hun plane .
