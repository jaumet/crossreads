<p>J.Shanahan and Jay Potts. There is a Y.M.C.A. there and we had a cup of hot tea but could get nothing else. Moislains is a ruined village, with a large church now smashed up. Their is a big cannal not finished running past Moislains and through the valley in front of this camp. All the locks and bridges have been blown up by the Germans as well as the railway. The railway is being repaired by the Canadians who are sawing off the broken ends of the rails and putting them together again.<br/>Yesterday evening I was at a Canadian on the outskirts of Peronne to get a paper which gave more details of the victories in Serbia and Palestine.<br/>Peronne is now full of troops and there are numerous trains running in all directions with war materials and thousands of motor vans &amp; many steam waggons are on the roads. There are many Americans here as well as other troops. There was a heavy artillery bombardment this morning &amp; again today.<br/>I was at a concert tonight which had a few Americans &amp; Tommy performers on it &amp; the audience was American English &amp;amp Australian</p>
