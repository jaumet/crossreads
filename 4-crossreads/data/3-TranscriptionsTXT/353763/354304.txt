Too much drinking here in certain sets  -  Young, nice chaps, with not much ballast get encouraged to drink & they cant stand it & you see the result both at the mess table & in the card room & then you'll see it in their jobs of work & next thing is they'll lose their billets  -  All we can do is by example - talking seems worse than useless  -
