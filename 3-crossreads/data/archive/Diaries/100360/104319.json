May 20   Snowy &amp; I shared a double Room.  After a wash &amp; Brush up, we went for a stroll around the City.  It was glorious to know that we were free, &amp; we wandered around till about midnight.  Then it commenced to thunder &amp; lighten &amp; the Rain poured down.  This made us think about Bed, but we found that it was too late to get a Bus or Taxi, &amp; just had to dodge back from from doorway to another.  It was in the early hours of the morning that we arrived back at our Hotel.  We soon turned in between the sheets &amp; were asleep in no time.</p> \r\n <p>Monday May 21  Woke up by a bang on the door &amp; a voice informing us that it was \"9 oclock\"  We hopped out of Bed &amp; opened the Door.  The Girl asked us if we?d like Break in Bed.  Of course we jumped at it.  Went back to Bed &amp; had Bacon &amp; Eggs &amp; Coffee.  Then we had a Bath.  Got dressed &amp; went out.  London is some Town alright.  After wandering around for a couple of hours we went into a Place &amp; had Lunch.  After Lunch I went to a Tailor &amp; got him to alter my tunic.  A girl from Paddington was working in the shop, &amp; she had a great yarn with \"Snowy\" Atherton  Returned to Shaftsbury &amp; had wash &amp; \"brush up\"<br> \r\n After Tea sat gazing out of window for a time. Then we went to Palace Theatre &amp; saw Vanity Fair.  A jolly fine Show.  Nelson Keys, funny as a Circus.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300078\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 78]<br> \r\n Tues. May 22.  Had Break in Bed again.  Got up about 9.  Went to Whitehall &amp;  saw them changing Guard.  Life Guards &amp; the Blues.  Great sight.  Then went on to Buckingham &amp; saw them changing Guard there.  It was wonderful.  The men marched like machines.  We also saw the men coming out after being decorated by the King.  There was a big crowd &amp; as each man came away he was greeted with much applause.   We then met Bunny  &amp; Charley Whitaker.  Visited Westminster Abbey.  Saw the Tombs of Wellington, Nelson &amp; many other famous persons, also saw the Gun carriage on which the Iron Duke's body was conveyed.  It is made of captured French Guns.  Went into a restaurant &amp; had a great feed of Steak &amp; chipped potatoes.  At night we went to see Chu Chin Chow.  It was a great Show.  Oscar Asche &amp; Lilly Brayton are as good as ever.</p> \r\n <p>Wed. May 23  Spent a quiet day wandering around the City, Riding in Taxis &amp; Buses.  The Girl Conductors look very sweet in their neat blue uniforms &amp; hats turned up at the side.  Visited Madame Tussaud's.  It was most interesting.  The wax figures look almost life-like.  Snowy &amp; I wandered into what we thought was a nice restaurant ? but it turned out to be vegetarian.  We tried some nut pie &amp; raspberry pudding ? then we gave it up &amp; went to another place for a feed.  In the afternoon we purchased Post Cards &amp; writing material &amp; went back to the Shaftesbury.  Had an hours sleep, then we spent an hour in the Writing Room.  Sent a few Post Cards &amp; wrote to Lill.  What a wonderful difference it would make if only she were here.  Gee! What a time we?d have.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300079\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 79]<br> \r\n Thur. May 24th  5 years today Lill left England   Father's Birthday &amp; Empire Day.  Snowy &amp; I went to Southend.  It was a Perfect Day.  We arrived Southend about midday.  Aunt Pudney was surprised to see me.  We had a good Dinner there.  Mr Pudney made us feel quite at Home.  Olive is a very nice Girl.  Mrs Pudney &amp; I adjourned to the sitting room, where we had a great old yarn about Lill.  She showed me her photo Album, in which I saw Lill Absolom as a Kid.  What a bonnie Kid she was too.  Florrie is married to a sergeant in the Flying Corps.  She is almost as good looking as her cousin.  Snowy &amp; I went for a stroll around the Town.  It was very quiet.  Mrs P wanted us to stay overnight, but we couldn't spare the time.  Went to a photographers to get my picture taken, but he was out.</p> \r\n <p>Fri. May 25th   Went to Southampton.  Got there about 2 oclock.  Aunt Nell was not a bit surprised to see me, as she said she had expected me so long.  It is a very nice part of the suburb in which she lives &amp; a very pretty cottage &amp; Garden.  I showed my collection of pictures  She (like everyone else) quiet fell in Love with Lill; &amp; asked me how I managed to win such a nice little Wife ? but that is a mystery.  I don't know myself.  She must miss Uncle Stewart very much.  I had a scrumptious Tea.  Ate about 2 lbs of Lovely Home made Cake.  Aunt Nell gave me what was left to bring away.  Snowy Atherton soon made a mess of it ? ably assisted by C.W. &amp; Bunny.  She was quite put out because I couldn't stay overnight, but Lord, what can a man do in 10 days?</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300080\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 80]<br> \r\n Saturday May 26  Got up about 8 &amp; went out quite early.  Had a shave.  Then I put my things together &amp; prepared to go to Stone.  Bunny &amp; Snowy came down to Euston with me &amp; saw me on to the Train.  Arrived Stafford 4 p.m.  Caught Train to Stone at 4.50.  Arrived Stone about 5.30.  Saw Jem. Starkey &amp; Topper Wooley on Station.  Didn't seem altered a bit.  Went to Crown &amp; Anchor.  It was great to be under the old Thatch one more.  Looked into Unicorn Hotel.  Saw Ernest Jackson &amp; had a great old yarn.  He's got awfully fat.  Just as left his shop met Mr Blakeman.  He would have me return then &amp; there with him, so I went back to Shirleywich with him.  Frank met us with the Float. He has grown into a big chap.  Ruth &amp; Mrs B. very pleased to see me.</p> \r\n <p>Mrs B looks quite an old Lady.  The Shock of John's death must have affected her very much.  Mr B. looks quite well.  Much better than I expected.  Ruth has grown into quite a woman.  Jolly fine woman, too.  John's wife looks very well.  His son Alec is a bright bonnie kid.  His Grandma &amp; Grandma think the world of him.  They made quite fuss of me.  Put me in such a lovely big room to sleep.  There were all kinds of Girls nick nacks hanging around &amp; it made me feel quite Homesick.  Felt lost without pyjamas.  Slept soundly &amp; peacefully.  Made me think quite a lot of M.S.  Bless Her.  Actually said my Prayers.  First time for years.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300081\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 81]<br> \r\n <strike>Monday</strike>\u00a0Sunday May 27.  Glorious morning.  In the Garden, a thrush was singing away merrily &amp; across the meadows came the call of the cuckoo.  I looked out of the window.  In the distance, the village Church bells were ringing &amp; all seemed good with the world.  What a difference to Bullencourt  After shaving &amp; ablutions I went down to Breakfast Bacon &amp; Eggs, &amp; nice Fresh Butter Gee! How I enjoyed it.  After Break. went round the Farm with Mr Blakeman, Frank &amp; young Alec.  My word he's a bonnie kid. <br> \r\n The crops are looking excellent.  There is plenty of Food for the cows &amp; they look fat &amp; content.  How I enjoyed my Dinner.  Roast Beef, Potatoes, Cabbage, followed by Beastings Pudding.  I almost felt ashamed of my appetite.  After Dinner we adjourned to the Drawing Room where Ruth played, &amp; Jack's wife sang. Three kiddies came to Dinner.  The elder girl was very pretty but she played the piano viley.  I quite enjoyed that afternoon.  After Tea I went to Church with Mrs Blakeman &amp; Ruth.  We arrived late.  It was a very nice service, &amp; the parson preached a good serMon.  In his spare time he works on the Land.  We had supper on our return.  Then Mr B. &amp; I sat yarning for about an Hour.  I went to Bed feeling at Peace with the world.</p> \r\n <p>Monday May 28.  After Breakfast I borrowed Frank's Bike &amp; went to see Lizzie Rowley, who lives about a mile away from Ruth's.  It was great to ride along the peaceful country roads, with the birds singing merrily &amp; the sun shining; &amp; very pleasant to talk to people in good old English after being in France &amp; Egypt for so many months.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300082\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 82]<br> \r\n Mon.

The Cemetery was looking very nice, plenty of flowers &amp; the green grass [lush?]  &amp; neat.  Father's grave I found quite easily.  It looks well &amp; evidently receives regular attention.  Went on to Stone.  Called in &amp; had a yarn with Annie Shardlow.  She told me some great yarns about Father.  Went to Unicorn Hotel.  Had tea there.

They don't seem to be altered much.</p>\n<p>Saturday June 2  [no entry]<br></p>\n"}]},"field_working_notes":[],"field_transcript_image":{"und":[{"fid":"105217","uid":"0","filename":"a5300014h.jpg","uri":"public://a5300014h.jpg","filemime":"image/jpeg","filesize":"1084721","status":"1","timestamp":"1389068103","type":"image","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":920,"width":1400},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"field_diary_title":{"und":[{"value":"Arthur John Moore diary, 11 November 1916-11 January 1918","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"Arthur John Moore diary, 11 November 1916-11 January 1918"}]},"field_page_number":{"und":[{"value":"14"}]},"field_review_notes":[],"field_url_path":{"und":[{"value":"/page/104319/view"}]},"field_status":{"und":[{"value":"6"}]},"field_transcript_edits":[],"panelizer":{"page_manager":{"entity_type":"node","entity_id":"104319","revision_id":"104342","name":"node:transcript_page:default","no_blocks":"0","css_id":"","css":"","pipeline":"standard","contexts":[{"identifier":"User","keyword":"user","name":"user","type":"current","uid":"","id":1}],"relationships":[],"did":"0","view_mode":"page_manager","css_class":"","title_element":"H2","link_to_entity":"1","extra":[],"display":{"args":[],"content":{"73":{"pid":"73","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:transcription_document_ref","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"hidden","formatter":"node_reference_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"0","locks":[],"uuid":"9ccbf756-f2b4-4d57-bbfd-7c7fa38c5a8f"},"74":{"pid":"74","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:page_weight","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"hidden","formatter":"text_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"1","locks":[],"uuid":"d24dfe39-4671-47ec-be85-d537d02b50be"},"75":{"pid":"75","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:field_page_completed","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"above","formatter":"list_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"2","locks":[],"uuid":"f9c3ede0-b95f-493f-9535-0a7366ece5b1"},"76":{"pid":"76","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:field_transcription","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"above","formatter":"text_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"3","locks":[],"uuid":"b609cc6b-c87b-4692-9520-01c431aa0e77"},"77":{"pid":"77","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:field_working_notes","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"above","formatter":"text_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"4","locks":[],"uuid":"127fb571-c17b-4a8f-8e0c-00fa63bdc743"},"78":{"pid":"78","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:field_transcript_image","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"above","formatter":"file_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"5","locks":[],"uuid":"ccd0c00a-13dc-4501-a91e-34e3d2b10f67"},"79":{"pid":"79","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"node_links","subtype":"node_links","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"override_title":false,"override_title_text":"","build_mode":"page_manager","identifier":"","link":true,"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":{"css_class":"link-wrapper"},"extras":[],"position":"6","locks":[],"uuid":"1ea8cc9d-43fc-484e-8bd9-467b53d82f4a"}},"panels":{"center":["73","74","75","76","77","78","79"]},"incoming_content":null,"css_id":null,"context":[],"did":"13","renderer":"standard","layout":"flexible","layout_settings":[],"panel_settings":[],"cache":[],"title":"%node:title","hide_title":"0","title_pane":"73","uuid":"8914f91c-b456-4f63-a7b8-22ba91035943"}}},"cid":"0","last_comment_timestamp":"1397715541","last_comment_name":null,"last_comment_uid":"1","comment_count":"0","name":"webadmin","picture":"0","data":"a:3:{s:7:\"contact\";i:1;s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;s:25:\"overlay_message_dismissed\";i:1;}","num_revisions":"1","current_revision_id":"104342","is_current":true,"is_pending":false,"revision_moderation":false,"path":"http://transcripts.sl.nsw.gov.au/content/arthur-john-moore-diary-11-november-1916-11-january-1918-page-14-1"}
