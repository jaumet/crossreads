<p>The weather up in these parts has been very changeable this month.  Yesterday was a perfect day, not a cloud to be seen, &amp; very little wind.  To-day has been one continual mass of rain with clouds almost on the ground, making flying quite impossible.<br/>We took advantage yesterday of the fine weather to go over "en masse" to a drome some 25 miles away and bomb the tripe out of it.  It was a rare bit of sport.  We went over in formation thus:- [diagram here] (diamond shape.  I was in the rear machine and about 200 ft above the two in front of me.  We were surrounded on either side by our fast scouts who hovered above us protecting our 4 bombing buses.  We got over Minchinhampton drome, and a mob of "enemy" scouts came after us and tried to split up our formation.  In France, once a machine is separated from its mates, old Fritz hops down on it like a vulture.  We kept our formation &amp; left our scouts to deal with the "enemy'" while we went on &amp; dropped our bombs (chemical ones) on our objective.  Several machines from that drome rose &amp; tried to cut the 4 of us off, but by this time our own scouts had returned, and when we started for home, we left a dog-fight in progress over the drome we had "bombed."</p>
