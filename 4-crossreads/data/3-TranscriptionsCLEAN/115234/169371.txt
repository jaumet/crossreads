  29 th  April 1918  
 Well quite an interval has elapsed since I last scrawled herein. 
 Things have happened 
 The Priest's house is a heap of ruins.  An eight inch shell lobbed right in the kitchen 
 Luckily we were all outside watching the acrobatics of one of our number as he manfully essayed to milk a goat.  I am writing this propped up in bed in 3 ward of No 2 B.G.Hospital
