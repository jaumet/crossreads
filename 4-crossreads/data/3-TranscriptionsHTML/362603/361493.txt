<p>I'm writing a short note to Dad as well, so I must leave some news for Him.  We had a parcel of comforts by the Comforts Club.  Everything was very nice.  We will be just right for the Winter Low.  It is as hot as anything yet.<br/>Well, be of Good Cheer &amp; don't Worry.  We both have a home in Salisbury &amp; mine is in such a beautiful spot.  A nice letter to Mr Fremantle "The Close" Salisbury Wilts. would not be out of Place.  Heaps of Love Harry</p>
