<p>C.R. Anderson<br/>13 Browning St.<br/>Seddon<br/>Vic.</p>
<p>Struck water Camp. From "Gordon Dump" to Trenches in Petrol tins. All along we passed evidences of last night's fray. Dead &amp; dying every where. Stretcher bearers hurrying past with bloody stretchers &amp; wnd. figures. Sickening horrors in the trenches Germans &amp; our own dead uncovered. One man of ours blew himself &amp; mate up with Mills bomb in pocket. Phosforus &amp; stink fare use to a horrible headache &amp; I lost all interest in the war. A'fternoon we dug shelves &amp; with Equip on &amp; W'proof sheets over us spent the night in fear &amp; trembling. Shelling fierce.</p>
