<p>2<br/>is in fact that winter is past and we are getting on to Spring and Summer.</p>
<p>I left the adjutancy of the 1st battalion in December last to go to Division to understudy the E.S.O. III there &ndash; much to my surprise and pleasure. After spending four months there I have now come on to the 1st Brigade to understudy the Brigade Major.</p>
<p>After laboriously climbing up the seniority list (and it takes a long time in our division) I got near to becoming a Captain and then all promotion in the A.I.F. was stopped. It is rather hard luck particularly as these appointments I have had on staff work are as a rule only given to Majors and Senior Captains. However I have had a good time at the war and have been happy all through.</p>
