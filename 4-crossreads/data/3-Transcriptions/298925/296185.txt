<p>I hear you calling me</p>
<p>1. I hear you calling me<br/>You called me when the moon had veiled her light<br/>Before I went from you into the night<br/>I came do you remember back to you<br/>For one last kiss beneath the kind star's light</p>
<p>2.  I hear you calling me<br/>And Oh the ringing gladness of your voice<br/>The words that made my longing heart rejoice<br/>You spoke O you remember and my heart<br/>Still hears the distant music of your voice.</p>
<p>3.  I hear you calling me<br/>Though years have stretched their weary length between<br/>And on your grave the mossy grass is green<br/>I stand, do you behold me, listening here<br/>Hearing your voice through all the years between</p>
