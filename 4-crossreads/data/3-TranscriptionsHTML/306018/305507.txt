<p>March 1918<br/>young Cave to Briggs for dinner &amp; afternoon tea.  We went out then to some French friends of the Briggs.  Met 5 or 6 French girls.  They were very friendly.  We stayed to tea &amp; afterwards had some games.  They are much more merrier than any English girls you meet &amp; we were soon on good terms with them.  It would take a month to make &frac12;  the progress with an English girl.  We enjoyed ourselves immensely &amp; are going to picnic to the Pyramids with them tomorrow afternoon.</p>
