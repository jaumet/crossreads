<p>On leaving the Station we entered the wide &amp; beautiful Avenue de Keyzer. It is a fine street &amp; contains many fine buildings &amp; places of amusement. Antwerp is a large &amp; commercial town &amp; is said to be the most important of the sea ports. A restaurant was soon found and a light breakfast was obtained;  but, the same as in Brussels, the price was very high. A few minutes walk from the Avenue, found us standing in front of the famous Cathedral. The church is famous, because of its age, over 500 years old.  Being Sunday morning the church was crowded so we entered the place, &amp; stayed for a few minutes listening to the singing. At the far end of the building we came across two famous paintings &ndash; the "Elevation of the Cross" and the "Descent from the Cross". They were painted by Ruben the famous Belgium painter. The pictures are priceless &amp; are wonderful to behold. Standing opposite the door of the Cathedral, is an old well, it is many hundred years old, and said to have been built by the famous artist Quentin Matsys, who was once a blacksmith. We saw quite a number of his pictures later on &amp; they were equally as good as Rubens. From the Cathedral we went to the Grand Place (large market) which was close by. Here we met a guide, who accompanied us, in our inspection of the city &amp; he was an interesting chap to talk to.</p>
