We were also packed like sardines, and with that and nothing to eat or drink, also the boiling hot sun shining on us made us feel very uncomfortable.  We reached Serapeum about four o'clock in the afternoon, we were then marched about two miles in the sand which I will never forget, there was also a strong wind blowing and the sand that was flying about nealy blinded us.  Anyhow when we got to the place where we had to join up our battalion, and I was very glad as I was dog tired.
