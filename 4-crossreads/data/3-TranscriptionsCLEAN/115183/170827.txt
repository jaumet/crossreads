(6?)Our farms where we were billeted were about 10 minutes out of the village. The village was only a small place but boasted a large church or rather what had been a fine church, for it had been burnt completely out by the Germans in 1914, and only the walls and square belfry tower remained. The day after our arrival the 15th June 1917 we fell in at 10.30 and marched down to an assembly ground in the village. Here the 9th Brigade was formed up to be addressed later by Brig Genl Jobson, commanding the brigade and then by Lieut General Godley, commanding the 2nd Anzac Army Corps to which we belonged. The latter complimented the brigade very highly on their part in the battle, saying they were given the right flank as a difficult post post of honor. He congratulated the men who were put forward by their cols as having done especially well. Among them Jim Prentice, sgt of the Brig Signal Section.
In the afternoon we went to see Jim who was feeling very pleased. The next day
