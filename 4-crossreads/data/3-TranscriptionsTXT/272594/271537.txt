a number of Germans who seemed to spring from nowhere  Bob & I immediately sprung up & came to the "on Guard" all this was done in a flash you might say for we never noticed that they were prisoners.  We startled the old Huns properly for they thought we meant it, up went their hands & they pulled all their belongings out, but they had nothing of any value, the other boys had "fanned" them before they got as far as us
