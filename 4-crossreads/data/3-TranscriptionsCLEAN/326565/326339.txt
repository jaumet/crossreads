Pitched a few tents, then rested the remainder of the day.  Turned very cool towards evening.
Wednesday 5/4/16Cooks fatigue for the day.  Much cooler than usual. Hospital tents pitched & commenced to take in Brigade sick.  Dysentery rather prevalent among the troops camping here; water apparently the cause.
Thursday 6/4/16Rather warm again.  Very little work carried out here during the middle of the day owing to the heat.  Flies very troublesome.  Walked across to roadhead about 11/2 miles
