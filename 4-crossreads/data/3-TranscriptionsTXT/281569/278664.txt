 Day lovely &amp; cool &amp; I regained my revolver it was found where I was rat hunting. The C O &amp; I are off to Assiut tomorrow to try out our lines of communications, we expect to catch the 6 oclock train in the morning.

 Rumors are afloat that we are off any day now somewhere down the canal a journey of 600 miles, it is said that Gen Ryrie fell in the last scrap &amp; we also suffered 177 casualties.  Mail came in today I got one from Nell, she was at home &amp; having a splendid time. Roy got his first bar also &amp; is now on the first rung.
