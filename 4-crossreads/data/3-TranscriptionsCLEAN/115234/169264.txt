 When the Hun has 
 ceased from troubling 
 And the Nations are 
 at peace 
 Then for home we'll 
 soon be doubling 
 Us blokes who came 
 overseas 
   
 Then will come a 
 wonderful greeting 
 When the ships tie up 
 to the Quays 
 And our loved ones flock 
 to the meeting 
 Of us blokes who came 
 over seas
