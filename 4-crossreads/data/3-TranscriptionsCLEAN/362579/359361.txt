  
 But other C.C. Stations have had to do all the work , so out M.O - (surgeons)   &  theatre Sisters have gone to help there. There is to be a great Stunt soon, so shall have plenty to do then. We are very busy getting our wards etc fitted up. 
 Have not seen much of the new Colonel, but he is a very  busy man. Am sure we will like him very much. Dorothy did not get her leave, so we may be  able to have it same time.
