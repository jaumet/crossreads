 More than 23,000 German prisoners have been taken on the Western front since September 25.  The French have captured in Artois and Champagne alone 121 heavy and field guns, while Sir John French reports the capture of 21 guns with many more abandoned between us and the enemy, as well as 40 machine guns, in addition to many destroyed by the bombardment. 
 A telegram despatched from Sofia on Sept. 23rd says that it is officially announced that Bulgaria, in ordering the mobilisation of her forces, has no aggressive intentions but is resolved to be fully armed to defend her rights and her independence, thus following the example of Holland and Switzerland at the beginning of the war.  In view of the movement of troops by her neighbours and the Austro-German offensive against Serbia, Bulgaria is obliged to proclaim an armed neutrality while she continues her pourparlers with the two belligerent groups. 
 A telegram from Athens on September 26th, states that at an interview between King Constantine and M. Venizelos, the Prime Minister, complete agreement was reached as to the measures to be taken for dealing with the situation and as to Greece's duty and obligations. 
 M. Venizelos has since (Oct. 2) announced the decision of Greece to stand by Serbia if she is attacked by Bulgaria. 
 Sir Edward Grey, speaking in the House of Commons on Sept. 29th, said:  "It is officially announced in Sofia that Bulgaria has no aggressive intentions whatever against her neighbours."
