Today has been fairly quiet here. During the past few days I have been fitting water carriers to the Limbers. I have done 5 and there are 4 more to do.

There is a cool change in the weather last night & today.
A squadron of enemy aeroplanes were over last night, & were driven off by archies & machine gun fire. They flew right over our camp the hum of their machines being like a hive of bees in the air.
