<p>young nation&#39;s greatest and best manhood, who answered their country&#39;s summons in the hour of need, and went out in the night to face they knew not what, but determined to stand at bay with any force or influence that chose to mar or soil the innocence of their sacred hearth and heath.&nbsp; At what a price?&nbsp; As a living member of that sacred band of Crusaders, I shall regard it as a Heaven-sent privilege,for all time, to have been given the opportunity of serving with, to have once been able to write after my humble name, those glorious letters, emblazoned with success and history, A. I. F.</p>
