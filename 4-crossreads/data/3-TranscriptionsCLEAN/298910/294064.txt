 Nice day - On duty to Estaire - Market day there & it was a great sight - Most large Towns have a big square in the very heart, here the country folk gather from daylight & take possessions of side walks etc & erect awnings etc to sell their products. Fowls - Fruit - vegetables - meats - also Geo Kingsley & I stopped a runaway horse make sausages - sweets - etc. Had a look thro the Town Hall - part of it is alotted YMCA, this is a very old building - the records of Mayors shows from 1789 - A fine big Church here must date back early into 1700.
