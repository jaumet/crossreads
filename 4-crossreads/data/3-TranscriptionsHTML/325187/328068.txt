<p>(The following paragraph is crossed out)<br/> You must be careful to omit all military news of value-  I heard of a Commander of a Cruiser losing his job, coz his Mother in law put an advt in paper re marriage of her daughter to Commander so &amp; so of HMS ________ inserting ship's name.</p>
<p>Left <strike>Val St Pauls Bay</strike> yesterday evening &amp; now en route for <strike>Salonika</strike>  I shall be glad to see something of that cosmopolitan place-  A fast Cruiser escorts us, it will be a full week ere I reach <strike><u>Alexandria</u></strike> or more-  <strike>I posted a letter for Dolly at Malta.</strike>  I will send these notes from <strike>Egypt</strike> if I get there!!!!  <strike>The Aegean Sea is not a pleasant place just now in trialling with submarines</strike></p>
