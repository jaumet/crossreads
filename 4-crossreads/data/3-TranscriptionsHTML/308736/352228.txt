<p>some time.  (Some men badly injured.)<br/>Just finished dinner when riot broke out against one Massey.  The M.Ps wanted him and the men wanted him.  No. 10 Canteen suffered during the disturbance.  First the "diggers" set fire to the back gates, then smashed them down.  Windows were broken wholesale, barrels of beer were rolled outside and emptied, all the stock was taken off the shelves.  All because they were sheltering the "mob of crooks" that the diggers were after.<br/>Later in the day the mob broke into 6 &amp; 9 canteens and emptied out the beer; then they took possession of the Q.M. Stores; every one helped themselves to whatever they wanted or didn't want. Evening. Went to concert in Y.M. While concert was on a blind rush took place after Ned Kelly up the hill, where they caught him and gave him a rough handling.</p>
