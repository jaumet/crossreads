  
 men are coming from the parties, wearing the trophies from bon-bons, boxes, & such like.  Minds one of after dinner decorations at home at the same annual festival.  Good luck to them again! 
 At 8 p.m. I read the rosary and the litany of the B. V. M. with some prayers for the Catholics who were at the lecture room.  One Sister and about twenty men attended.  Late arrival at dinner was of advantage in that it made me an odd number, enabling one to be a listener to the merry chatter and the rippling laughter which flowed from my neighbours, both officers and nurses.  Brief replies sufficed for sentences addressed to me.  Enclosed you should find two leaves taken from off the Christmas cake which was on the table beside me, the trophies were in much demand, mayhap for friends far across the ocean. 
 Should Mrs. Reynolds like to learn about me and my voyaging please send her word to come that she may look through this letter. 
 Good night!  Good night!!!  Good night!!!! 
 26-12-14. We expect soon to be within site of land, & breath the perfume that is said to come from the growths on Ceylon.  The island of my childish fancy which was the first of those towards the East Indies stated in legend to be whence the spices came for consumption in Europe.  Should we be allowed to land, of the country some notes may reach you at a future date. 
 Good bye my dear.  God bless you.  To Mother M. Joseph - Bertrand, - Pins, their Sisters please convey my best wishes & regards. 
 To you go heaps of love & loads of kisses from one who thinks of you often & remains 
 Your affectionate & loving Faree John B. Nash
