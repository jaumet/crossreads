<p>We seen plenty of Hop vine frames on the way also tobacco leaves drying on the walls of some of the Houses.  We walked over the frontier to Steenvorde where we were supposed to Billet but found the 7th Brigade had jumped our Billets.  After standing about in the cold for 1&frac12; hours we tramped on to Winnezeele 3 or 4 miles further on making about 15 miles in all.  Even then C. Coy had to Bivouac in the fields &amp; there was a very severe frost.  Plenty of Blackberries here but the frost has nipped them.  We slept 200 in a Barn.  I went into the village in the night &amp; had  tucker &amp; some wine.</p>
<p>Sunday 22-10-16<br/>On the road again at 8.15 A.M.  The Germans penetrated 4 miles past Winnezeele in their advance.  The Villagers thought they were English troops. They were soon driven back.  The country is now becoming undulating &amp; very pretty.  Awfully cold today.  Arrived in Arneke at 2.30 P.M.  billeted in a Barn.  Church here 307 years old.  Very footsore.  They have dogs here working a churn by means</p>
