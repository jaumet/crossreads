It certainly appears as if the initiative has passed to us & we see every indication of a big push being made on the Amiens front.  I passed dozens of heavy guns today going up, from 60 pdrs to 9 inch & tonight we saw a lot more. Tomorrow I am to equip an Ambulance with dressings & supplies likely to be wanted in a big advance so something is truly afoot, I hope so as a definite victory this side of Christmas will show the world the winning side.  The Canadians are appearing in strength & will probably be used as they have been resting for some months.  Hundreds of tanks are forward.  Our 4th Division have relieved the French on the Eight but I hope they don't use our crowd too much as we are not too strong in numbers.
