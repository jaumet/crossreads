  
 Monday 10.1.16 (19) Usual routine till 7 pm when Capt Teague gave a lecture in F Ward on how to keep out of mischief in Egypt. 
 The weather all the time is very cool & the sea is calm. Every morning about 2 am the wind rises a bit & we have a shower of rain but otherwise it is just like a trip to Manly on a breezy Saturday afternoon. 
 I washed some clothes & hung them over the steam pipe at the back of my bunk & they dries by night time. 
 Tuesday 11.1.16 (20) A very eventful day. 
 Usual routine till 2.45 when Capt Bray gave another lecture.
