<p>Sunday 7th<br/>The sea is now lovely &amp; smooth, &amp; not much rougher than crossing to Manly.<br/>This is the fifth day out from Sydney, four of those days we had rather blowy &amp; a little rough.<br/>We called in at Melbourne for a few hours only, two or three, &amp; do not think that we will see any more land until we arrive at Suez.<br/>Our course appears to be almost due west slightly north.<br/>Have got over the Sea sickness, to day have a touch of Rheumatism in the feet, brought on through sitting about on deck in the wind. Went down to tea to night for the first time since we left Melbourne.<br/>To day we saw what we took to be a whale, but it was a little too far off to have a good look.<br/>Monday Nov. 8th.<br/>Best day so far. The Sun is showing better.<br/>Wrote letter to Louie &amp; home to day.<br/>Wednesday 11th 15<br/>Yesterday we called in at Albany to put off some sick. Albany is a very pretty little place situated on the side of two hills. We were only there a few hours, arrived about 6 A-m departed mid day.<br/>Took a few photos</p>
