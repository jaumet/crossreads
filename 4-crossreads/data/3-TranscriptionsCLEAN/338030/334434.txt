we were ordered to scatter, and once to remain motionless. In the afternoon I went some distance with a wagon for provisions, during which time it snowed hard.On Tuesday, 3/4/17, I left the 103rd Bty., and joined the 9th Bty., about a mile away.On Thursday, 5/4/17, took guns into action about 4 miles further up. The shells were bursting round about us and could be heard whizzing through the air, so, as soon as the guns were in position, we lost no time in getting away.On Friday afternoon, I took a trip to the guns with provisions.Easter Saturday, 7th, we shifted guns to new position, as Germans were making it that hot that the guns had to be abandoned. We left in the afternoon, and travelled part of the way and waited till nightfall. We then proceeded under cover of darkness and succeeded in moving the guns and ammunition. We got back to camp at 6 next morning.On Sunday, 8/4/17, we moved our camp back to Forest, about a mile away, where we were before (Villers Au Flos).Easter Monday went and pulled some wagons out of the mud with mules.On Tuesday, 10/4/17, we shifted our guns further up. We left at 1 p.m., and, during a violent snow-storm, succeeded in shifting them, arriving back at 11 p.m. On the way back we lost our way in the dark. I was in the lead, so I just let my mule go his own way and, sure enough, it was not long before we were home.
