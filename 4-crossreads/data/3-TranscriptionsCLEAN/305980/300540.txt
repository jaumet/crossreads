 January 
 1:  New Years day & a good one too.  After a starve of six days, received a good issue from Red Cross, so we got busy & made up for Xmas day..  Taubes paid us a visit, but only wounded one man & 4 horses with six bombs.  Still raining & bitterly cold. 
 4:  Heavy rain & sand storms: only got out of our bivies for feed & water our horses. No lights allowed, owing to expected night air raids. 
 6:Taubes over at 9 p.m., orders to lead our horses away from the lines.  23 bombs dropped & m.g. playing a lively tune, keeping us out in the cold for over half an hour. Archies opened out to make things worse, caps & cases falling every where & utterly impossible to see the machines.  Not a soul or animal was hit, though some of the bombs went rather close to big targets. 
 7:  First church parade at Arish, but in the midst of it we were ordered to get back to our horses & take them off the lines, outposts having reported hostile machines
