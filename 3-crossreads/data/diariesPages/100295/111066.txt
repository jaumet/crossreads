Harvey ? my batman, estimable lad, is like a mother has arranged a great bunch of flowers on my table. It is a pleasant, calm peaceful reaction after a day amidst guns battle. 
A great battle has been fought today the Australians have again carried their objectives. The casualties have been heavy, but out of proportion to the important advance great number of Boche prisoners. I'm sick of being amongst killed wounded hearing that hellish din of cannonade dodging shells. One becomes a fatalist I am convinced its no good shell dodging. We have even a worse time than the infantry, for to get pictures one must go into the hottest even then come out disappointed. To get War pictures of striking interest
