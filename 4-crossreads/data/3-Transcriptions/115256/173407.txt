<p>Thursday 3 June 1915</p>
<p>Nov. 20th<br/>Back form Lemnos to Durrants Post.</p>
<p>Nov. 27th<br/>Snow for the first time &ndash; early fall &ndash; numerous cases of frost bite!  Everything very quiet.  Gallipoli will never spell success to Allies.</p>
<p>Dec. 13th<br/>First rumours of Evacuation.  Are we on the eve of the most stupendous, colossal blunder in the annals of military history?  Maybe, may be not.  A week will tell, at any rate.</p>
<p>Dec. 17<br/>Gen. Birdwood visits firing line.</p>
<p>Dec. 19th<br/>"Der Tag".  Everything upside down.  Waste beyond description.  Many own crosses &amp; friendly warring against the Teutons left with Johnny Turk.  Also Dummies galore.</p>
