3rd July 1917. Reveille 5 30. Fooling around as usual. Balance of battery went up to position tonight. We are not going up. Day hot.
4th July 1917. Reveille 530. Packed up left for battery at 9 oclock. Arrived at new position passed over the ground of our recent advance. Its an eye opener to anyone. There is hardly a piece of ground which was once Fritzs intact. Saw some of the mine craters on the Ridge. Our position is on the Ridge a little way north of Messines. Spent the afternoon in making a dugout. Went on duty 8 ? 12.
5th July 1917. Woke up at 7 this morning with Fritz putting heavy shells right close. On duty through day at 8 till 12 6 till 8. Fritz shelled heavily today getting one of our guns in the stunt although I dont think he was on our battery. Shelled again tonight the big bits coming very close.
6th July 1917. On duty at 4 till 8. Left battery at 2.30 for a job down the trenches in OP which lasts for 24 hours. The OP is in one of Fritz's dugouts which have been badly knocked about by our shells. On the Phone till 1 oclock.
7th July 1917. Did not have much sleep at OP. Down there till 3 oclock when we were relieved by another battery. Came back had tea went to bed. Fritz aeroplanes very active today.
8th July 1917. Woke at 8. Went on duty at 12 till 4. Very sloppy after last night's rain on duty from 8 till 12. Received letter from Eileen after a long of waiting.
