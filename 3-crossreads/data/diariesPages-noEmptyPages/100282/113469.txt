think I will spend a few days with Mr Duke then go on to Ireland for I would like to have a look at her before going back to "Aussy".
Our guns ("heavies") were blazing out tonight with a vengeance the aeroplanes must have spotted some movement of the Huns for they circled over the "batteries" for a full hour signalling with their machine guns directing fire.
I laughed this afternoon, a Fritz plane came across got well over our lines he made straight for one of our observation balloons he darted at it like a hawk out flew the occupants like birds parachuted gracefully to the ground after all the Fritz missed the balloon he had the luck of his life to get home but he put the "wind up" the observers.
