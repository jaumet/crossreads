<p>4<br/>pieces and reconstructed in all but the ironworks. In each case it means two or three weeks delay and an expenditure of &pounds;5000 &ndash; &pounds;10000 but money doesn't seem to enter into Naval matters as a consideration of any moment. And you never know when you have them &ndash; they're always liable to change their minds at the last moment, and undo all the work they have just completed.</p>
<p>I had the hardest evenings work on Easter Monday that I've had for a long time. I was informed at 6.30 p.m. that I was acting as best man at a wedding at 8.30 and that no arrangements had been made. Not a taxi in the city available owing to their strike &ndash; the minister away out at Abassia, the bride in another part of the city, the bridegroom here and the church in a different direction again.</p>
<p>It took me two hours almost to get a car &ndash; no dinner &amp; no time to change out of old slacks, dirty boots etc. It was a queer show but eventually when I got home about 1 a.m. everything was fixed up. The hurry was due to circumstances brought about by the war here and was unavoidable but I'm finished with being best man.</p>
<p>My kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>R.J. Hunter<br/>P.T.O.</p>
