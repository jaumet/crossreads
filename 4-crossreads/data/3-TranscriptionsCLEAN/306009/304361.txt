Work has been pretty easy lately  - Start about 8.15 a.m. with "Shay" (tea) at 11, knock off at 12.30 - dinner & usually  no more work for the day although there must always be one chap in the office out of 3. After dinner got busy on a big juicy watermelon. Pretty good - Betcher! Spending the afternoon at French & Arabic. 4 of the Westminster Dragoons including a Covent Garden singer, gave a concert at 8 p.m.
