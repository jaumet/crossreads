Two in an air collision, in a cloud, one dived straight to earth, dropped a bomb, killed 3 men and wounded 2.  Only one man aboard, got his jaw, one leg, and one arm broken.  The 101st Howitzer Bty., two men wounded.  The 6th Bty. had some men killed.  A lot of men and horses killed in Bapaume last night.  The broad gauge railway near our camp torn up and carted away.  Rails and sleepers, only the Blue metal left.  All timbered dugouts burned.  The destruction was carried out on a wholesale plan.  We are camped on an aerodrome.</p>
