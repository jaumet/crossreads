<p>got out at Trafalgar Square &amp; put up at Morleys Hotel a flash but good place.  After getting fixed up I went for a stroll round the streets &amp; had a look at the Square which they are transforming into ruined villages, trenches, &amp; etc., they have big guns everywhere &amp; when it is opened all War Bonds purchased will be signed inside these guns.  England is going to raise another gigantic loan &amp; this is one of the ruses she is trying to get people invest.  London never seems to change, her streets are just as crowded &amp; busy as ever &amp;amp no one appears to worry in the slightest about the war the more one sees of this great city the more I am lost in admiration &amp; wonder at the working of it, truly she is a marvellous old town.</p>
<p>5th.  Woke up this morning to find it raining slightly &amp; very dull.  After breakfast I went for a stroll round the city hunting for films &amp; after trying dozens of places eventually</p>
