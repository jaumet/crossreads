<p>December 1915</p>
<p>Tuesday 28<br/>Fine    It rained heavily during last night and as I was sleeping on the boat deck I had to get up and move my bunk to a drier spot. Hitched up to the wharf about 11 AM. [indecipherable] scenes on wharf with natives.</p>
<p>Wednesday 29<br/>Fine Left boat about 7 PM. And boarded train which had drawn up on wharf in readiness for us. Things were only middling amongst the men and there were hot scenes on the way to Telelkebir our destination. We had several long stops chief of which was Zagazig.</p>
