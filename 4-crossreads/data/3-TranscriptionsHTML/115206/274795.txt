<p>August,1918<br/>Tuesday 13</p>
<p>Villers Brettoneaux and Cayeau<br/>Left with column for twas rumoured Rosieres. Ken and myself jumped a motor lorry to Harbonniers, where we waited for column to pass. However column did not come our way so we searched, aided by motor lorries and our feet until we found them situated in a little hollow close to the latter village. The hour was then 11.55.pm so we built our home and before going to sleep listened to the wily Hun dropping his bombs. Heard that old Les Critten was killed from Cpl Andrews. [indecipherable] and Spence also Dean were wounded last night</p>
