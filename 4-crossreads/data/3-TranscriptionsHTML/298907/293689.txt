<p>&amp; as we walked past the hospital the whole crowd of the boys &amp; nurses craned their heads to see us, &amp; what a hooray we got when we marched in after putting our girls on the tram &amp; started them off for home, they are both bonza girls &amp; one's you can take anywhere &amp; as jolly as you like.</p>
<p>22nd. Went down to the Rink skating this afternoon till 4 oclock &amp; nearly got into a nice argument over those skates I bought from a chap there a week or so ago, it appears from what the rink men say that he sold their skates, <strike>that what they say</strike> &amp; they showed me their brand on them, of course an argument started &amp; soon got pretty hot, they wanted to take them off me but he had no chance</p>
