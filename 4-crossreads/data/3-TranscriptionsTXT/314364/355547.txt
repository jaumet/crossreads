Thurs. Feb.13.Am taken off the night Job now & put in charge of the Pack Stoves. It should be a fair Job if only I can get a decent place for a store. The Hospital is run on very "slip shod" lines, & one is kept wondering what is going to happen next. Last night we had quite a decent Impromptu Concert on Deck. It seems strange that in spite of the enormous amount of money that has been subscribed to the Red X & Comfort Funds this ship was allowed to leave Port without a Piano. The Music at last nights Concert was supplied by 2 Diggers  1 Cornet & 1 Violin.There are quite a number of Scabies patients undergoing Treatment. Carson is attending to them & I am issuing clean clothes. Dropped a few lines to Lill..Thurs. 13 (cont.)"Bluey" Downing & I occupy one of the Hospital Cabins, which is very comfortable.The weather is good & sea calm. The popular game of "House" & this old "Crown & Anchor" Board are much in evidence, & the Diggers are keeping their [indecipherable] well circulating.
