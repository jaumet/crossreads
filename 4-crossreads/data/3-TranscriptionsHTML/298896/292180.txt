<p>four to sleep. We had two germans through who had been out for a couple of days &amp; one man I gave chloroform to while the M. O. tied some arteries. Cases came in slowly during the night &amp; just as well as with four men it was a fearful job carrying them down steep stairs into the tunnel and then up again into the car. Had about 25 through. Felt fresh after a shave &amp; breakfast. About 10 A.M. the 6th Fld amb arrived &amp; I had to make out inventory lists of everything I handed over. This took me time as stretchers blankets etc were all over the place &amp; I had to do most of it myself. At 11 I handed over &amp; then had some lunch after which I loaded our own gear on our 4 cars &amp; set off to open up a new post about a kilometre out of Bellecourt which turned out to be an old trench. Here we formed a post to treat walking wounded cases only the possy being the trench with a tent over the top. Fixed all this up &amp; then decided to turn in as I had a fearful headache. After 4 hours got up &amp; after managing to carry on through the night returned to bunk which was a small dugout. Had one man wounded coming through Bellicourt our casualties</p>
