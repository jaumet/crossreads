B.B. appears harmless enough &amp; inclined to be friendly to the khaki &ndash; from long association with transports (coaling) he has adopted something of a military style &amp; may be seen after hours, strutting round<br/>in khaki riding pants &amp; leggings. Always he carries a highly polished stick. The pants are pinched &ndash; the stick comes out of the scrub &amp; is usually crooked &amp; far from light. One thing is very noticeable &ndash; B.B. says 'Australian soldier good boy' with great sincerity of expression.  Aus. soldier good boy because he treats B.B. to spare coppers, bread, condensed milk &amp; cigarettes in return for Ju-Ju dances. We had one Ju Ju dance rendered by old Nicks favorite grand child. The biggest &amp; ugliest human being I ever hope to see. Put him on the Tiv. &amp; he'd bring a fortune &ndash; if he didn't start a panic. The whites here look on the nigs as so much dirt, but from a physical point of view BB looks the better man &ndash; excepting Raffir &amp; Coolie. The up-country natives are easily picked out by their graceful carriage &amp; big limbs. Some of them would be rough customers to handle.</p>
