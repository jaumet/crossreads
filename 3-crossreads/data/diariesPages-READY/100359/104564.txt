The very idea of the "Huns" or anyone daring to "play up" in a country like this seems almost a sacrilege. We have all heard a lot about France, but it is far more beautiful than any of us ever dreamed. There were 8 of us in each carriage. Oru crowd consisted of MacDougall, Payney, Frank Woods, Aldis, "Miles" Sheehaw, Bert Hunt, Stan Wright, and Myself. The carriages were not too good, but far more comfortable than the stinking boxes we rode in, in Egypt. We looked out of the windows as long as we could. It did not get dark till about 10 then we unrolled our blankets and tried to sleep, but very few of us had much sleep; as the floor was too jolly hard.
Saturday 24th
We were all awake about 5, when we tried to get a wash in our mess tins, it freshened us up, anyhow. Then we chewed some bully beef and biscuits and said we?d had breakfast. Then we continued to feast our eyes on the glorious country through which we were steaming. At intervals of a few hundred yards the French soldiers are posted, guarding the Railways, also on all the Bridges and crossings. They all seemed to be men about 40 50 Their uniforms of blue and grey and some wearing scarlet pants, looked very quaint to us, after being used to nothing but Khaki. We greeted them all with hearty cheers, and threw them cigarettes and tobacco of which we had a good supply. When we pulled up at a station the kids all rushed up and begged for "souvenirs" badges off our hats or coats, or coins and they seemed quite delighted even with a tin of corned beef. It is hard to realise that this country is at war, as all the people look so happy and content but we can't help noticing the absence of men and the number of people in mourning.
