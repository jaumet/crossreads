  
 March 1918 young Cave to Briggs for dinner & afternoon tea.  We went out then to some French friends of the Briggs.  Met 5 or 6 French girls.  They were very friendly.  We stayed to tea & afterwards had some games.  They are much more merrier than any English girls you meet & we were soon on good terms with them.  It would take a month to make 1/2  the progress with an English girl.  We enjoyed ourselves immensely & are going to picnic to the Pyramids with them tomorrow afternoon.
