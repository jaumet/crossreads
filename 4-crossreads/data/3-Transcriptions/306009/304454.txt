<p>1915<br/>Sep. 29 Wed.<br/>Went into Cairo at 4 p.m. to make inquiries about the present whereabouts of some chaps, at the Intermediate Base.<br/>Had a chat with Harold Kershaw who has come back from the Peninsula with dysentery.<br/>Am just about tired of Cairo &amp; if no chance of promotion or move of the Unit takes place soon, I feel like going across to Gallipoli.</p>
