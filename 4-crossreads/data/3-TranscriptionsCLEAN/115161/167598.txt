 While on fatigue work during the day we can see the Germans doing work behind their front line, so we are not very far away. 
 We had to shave every morning and the only way to procure water was by breaking through the ice in the shell holes.  I don't think the razor had much to do with cutting the hair off, I really think it bent the bristles over and they snapped off, so perishing cold was it, standing outside our dug-out.

These things were all in a day's work, and did not effect us very much. 
 We were allowed a small piece of candle in our dug-outs, the result being that the heat from same would thaw the ice on the iron and make us comfortably wet.
