<p>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Arrived in Taree &amp; stayed</p>
<p>at Fotheringham&#39;s Hotel. Saw Redman</p>
<p>&amp; Lee&nbsp;in morning, but they are too</p>
<p>slow for anything. I wasted a</p>
<p>day there, &amp; drove out to Fo<sup>r</sup>ster</p>
<p>with John Newman after tea</p>
<p>Stayed with him the night.</p>
