 Bustard Trenches, 
  Somewhere in England . 
 October 4th 1916. 
 My Dear Ones, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; This is just a few lines written from trenches, where we have dug, fought, slid, swum, splashed and been soaked through and through, and still enjoy the joke; today I&#39;ve had a bit of a spell, and the first shave for three days.&nbsp; We have lived under Active Service con-ditions here, worked the trenches by day and by night, fought an attak, dug hasty trenches and then retired from their counter attack and found the work very interesting.&nbsp; I&#39;ll write at length on Sunday, for the present, all love 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.

 My Dear Ones, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; This is Saturday, cold and bleak, the others have gone into Salisbury but I&#39;m in my hut, I&#39;ve just finished three hours work on my Lewis Gun School Note Book and now feel free to write to you, I havefinished work and now can take my recreation. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I am attending a local school on the new machine gun, and am anxious to get a first classpass.&nbsp; Did I tell you that I qualified at the Ranging Course at Hayling, that was the ony standard and I believe I got very nearly the possible marks.
