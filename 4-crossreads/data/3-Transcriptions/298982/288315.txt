<p>Thur 1st July Out of trenches at 5 &amp; to blankets. Rested to 12 Out of sorts. Feel need of different tucker, want tinned milk &amp; cocoa or coffee. Officers can buy or obtain all they require but a private even if he has money can get nothing Day in day out Bully Sun bathed for weeks, bacon &amp; cheese &amp; jam. None of them bar former too bad but the stomach revolts at the eternal sameness No fruit preserved or otherwise</p>
<p>Rice <u>second</u> time to day - Bennett roots Bob Harrison up with his foot. Bob curses him. This is a fair idea of what one can expect from such officers (cads) as we have. Dolly McLeod is back. Heard him say he'd lost a stone, but he's gained no savoir faire. Makes no attempt to greet his men or ask how things are going</p>
