<p>Thursday 3 July 1919<br/>Rained in the morning. Went to Earls Court &amp; got my cake then to Maries flat. She wasn't in but waited till she came. Got told off for not writing &amp; telling her about the engagement. Through speaking so long to her I missed a train to Brighton. Got one half an hour later. Janet met me at the train. We walked a bit &amp; then went on to the Palace then till it was time for my train. My lip is improving. Gee it is some sore tho.</p>
<p>Friday 4 July 1919<br/>Fine today. The car broke down whilst I was having my lesson so went into town. Booked seats &amp; a table for dinner for tomorrow night. Met Bill &amp; George at the bank &amp; had lunch with them. Took a couple of photos. One of Aussie House &amp; a couple of Trafalgar Square. Planes were flying about dropping leaflets advertising the London [indecipherable].</p>
<p>Met Bill again &amp; had dinner at his place &amp; then we went out to Marie's. Left early tho &amp; took George to the train &amp; then came home.</p>
