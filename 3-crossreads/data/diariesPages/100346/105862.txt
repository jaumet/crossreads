Pal of Mine
Ginger wasn't much to look at he was dirty vulgar low
But I bet he's a favourite where game dying soldiers go
He?d never had no schooling he?d sell his shirt for wine
But I loved him as a brother ? lion hearted pal o mine
Oftd I see you little comrade as I did that winter's morn
your blood flecked lips swearing the old smile ever worn
Where the rattle of the rifles the roar of bursting shell
With screams of men hard dying made it all a proper Hell
On that grey cheerless morning the mist wrack all aswirl
I kissed you lips old comrade as I've never kissed a girl
"Fall in" for you was sounding ? the last great trumpets call
Your soul "stood to attention" on the field that levels all
Well I don't know much of Heaven this harps halo game
Though the Chaplain used to tell us as how a Christian came
Who?d save the poor lowly if they pray?d it to him square
Though in hell I am game to meet you little comrade if youre there
Yet I sometimes get to thinking in the day beyond the night
There's a Heaven home for soldiers who battle for the right
The soldier's Hell is No mansland with the star shells overhead
 the red moon kind of leering on the battered bloody dead
