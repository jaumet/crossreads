That sheepskin vest you gave me has been most useful already &amp; I think with its aid I will possibly be able to pull through the winter!

I heard from Wilkie a few days ago he seemed flourishing &amp; had taken on office work which I think is v. wise of him.
You may have seen the notice of the death of my brother, the one you met when you had that house at Manly if you remember;  I am now trying to get leave to be home for the dedication of the window the family have erected to his memory but do not know whether it will come off.  I must now end up &amp; take advantage of a fairly warm day to wash some article of clothing (only having one of each) &amp; also attend to the many irritating visitors!  With kindest regards &amp; please remember me to all at Tog. [Toganmain].
Yours sincerelyErnest E. Kirby
