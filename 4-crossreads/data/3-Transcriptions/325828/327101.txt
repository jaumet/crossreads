<p>It is partly for this reason that I am not on Scout machines as weight is an important factor when you need to climb to 23,000 ft.  I was disappointed at first at being put on as Corps Pilot but am quite satisfied now as my machine has &amp; will have in future a stationary engine, much more reliable than rotaries.<br/>Must close now, with love to all at home<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.<br/>P.S. No home mail to hand for close on 2 months now.  Will probably get a budget when it starts.<br/>Leo.<br/>P.P.S. Must acknowledge with thanks the remittance for &pound;10 that I cabled for from Wendover.  J.L.W.</p>
