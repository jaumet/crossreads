sniping bunyips on the banks of the Bogan. They have been long in reaching me I received 19 letters all at once, all old I should have received them all "bar one" while I was in Egypt. two from Dora C. written in January one from a friend of Johns written in May, a Mr G.A. Linter. ask J when you see him I dont remember him giving me Linters address, he gave me, Charlie Edwards and another, I saw one of them Mackinson, he asked to be remembered to J they are attached to our Brigade, but I only saw any of their Coy once to speak to just before we went to Pozieres, I dont know where they are now, none of my Platoon mates came to this hospital and I dont know just how many of them were killed or injured over there, it was a hot corner for a while but we gave more than we got, and if we lost heavily, fritz did also and our lads held what they had taken. I must ring off now it is 10.40 P.M. So for the present goodnight the first patient for this ward has just arrived a stretcher case, there has been once death in this ward since we arrived here a young fellow from somewhere up near Grenfell. he had his left arm off and suffered a lot at times. The nurses were very good, and did everything Possible but could not "save him".
