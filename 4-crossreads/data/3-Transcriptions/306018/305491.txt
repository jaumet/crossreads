<p>February 1918<br/>said she was sorry she could not have had 20 more present.  We dwindled away in 2s &amp; 3s.  Mrs Cornish wanted some of us to remain to dinner.  I didn't like to make "too much of a good thing" so went back to town by the 7 tram &amp; had tea at the Australian Soldiers Club, a place just recently opened here by the Church of England under the management of Canon Garland.  There was a Memorial Service at the Cairo Cemetery in the afternoon for fallen Australian Soldiers.<br/>I would have liked to have gone.  I believe there was a good attendance there.</p>
<p>Monday 25th<br/>Major Ferguson was in the office in the morning.  I showed him a good deal about the work here.  He is now in command of the 2nd Training Regiment at Moascar.  The weather turned very cold after 12 oclock, with heavy gusts of wind.  Looks a good bit like more rain.  Went for my lesson</p>
