Friday 13 Sept. 1918
Yesterday morning Sgt Kerry of the O. Room told me that a nominations had been called for from the Colonel for one name the position of Education Officer with a unit in the 1st Division   Each Battalion will have one & the whole of the other details such as AA.M.C. & A.AS.C., one each to a division. The Colonel wanted to see me at 2 p.m in his tent, & when I went he told me that he had decided to nominate me. My lack of degrees or diplomas is distinctly against me, but my organising ability will give me a dog's chance. Sgt Kenny gave me a copy of the order, to judge my the wording of my application form, & on it I noticed the names of Sgt. Woodyard, Pte Dalton, Pte Maynard, Pte Barlow & Pte Holt, with the latter underlined. I would like to get the job, but the chances are not great.
