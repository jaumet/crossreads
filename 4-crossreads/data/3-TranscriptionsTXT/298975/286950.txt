 Aug 1917 letter from Les Walsh in France. Went for a walk in evening. Through Ye Olden Village and down rustic lanes. It is all very pretty &amp; old. What surprises me is that people have gone to so much trouble with this country. It has such a vile clymate. But things seem to grow well 
 Thursday  30 Started work today &amp; it was quite fine. The method here are better than Aus. But must not say to much untill I have seem more of it. The meals are good &amp; plentyfull Bought this pen today for 5/- it is better than using pencil. Should have written a lot more
