 Delville Wood 10/11/16  About 11.30 am a Taube came over and a fight ensued with one of our planes.  The anti-aircraft guns also got going and presently the Taube crashed down to the ground from a great height one of its wings coming down after it.  After lunch amid great cheers from the men another plane was seen to fall from where a fight was going on but recovered itself before reaching the ground and flew away.  This, however, was one of our own and must have had a sideslip.  Aeroplanes fire at each other with Lewis guns and the sound is a "bubbly" rattle.  The report of anti-aircraft guns is also different from ordinary guns firing having a hollow sound.  At sunset the enemy put several shells round the camp but hurt nobody.  Our observation balloons are up in scores and very close together.  They are sent up in a kind of echelon covering one another off.  From sunset onwards a most deadly and uncanny quiet set in, an absolute silence taking the place of the usual rumble and roar.  It was eerie.  The chaplain turned up mud up to the waist and we are putting him up.  All blankets came out today and I have laid in reserves of rum, sugar, tea and biscuit with some pork and beans to set up any poor chaps who dribble down.  Trench feet are our curse.  Orders are issued that men must change their sox and rub feet. How can they do it up in front when a man can't sit down.  Covering the feet with whale oil is the only preventative.  Hot beef tea was served out after dark and all here are quite comfortable.  A plane went across about 6 and shot a flare across the sky, our searchlights tried to pick it up.  The deadly silence of guns continued until long after midnight.  Heavy reaper and binder rattle of some heavy air machine.  Things were very quiet on the Western Front.
