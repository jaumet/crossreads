the bursting flash of the shells was very pretty. Today is the most sedentary day I've spent since arriving in Anzac. Have been siting down all day had no exercise. Feel nothing like as "fit" and alert as in Egypt where the tough raining made us hard as nails. After dinner in the evening heard Tom sounded on a ship's bugles. The first bugle call we have heard for 2 months, and a sound it is to gladden a soldiers heart ! Remember the massed buglers of the Westminster Dragoons sounding "Officers Mess" at Kasr el Nil Le Caire. listening from a houseboat on the Nile with the whole scene draped in wonderful night, who could forget ?! Nothing doing during the evening. Bed 2000
