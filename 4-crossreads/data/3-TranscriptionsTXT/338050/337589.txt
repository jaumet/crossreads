 29th. Dec. It has been raining pretty well ever since we came here. This morning we had several lectures &amp; tonight we went out for night operations. When we got out about three miles it came on to rain very heavily &amp; we turned round &amp; came back. 29 th. Dec. Marched four miles out to Kangaroo Range where we fired fifteen rounds apiece. 31st. Dec. Church parade &amp; saw off a draft including Sgt. McKenzie. 1st January 1917. Route march in the morning &amp; a rifle cleaning parade in the afternoon. 2nd, Jan. Two route marches one in the morning &amp; one in the afternoon behind a rotten band. We were paid tonight in French money. 3rd. Jan. Two route marches again today. I had to take off one of the stripes today. We will all have to take them off when we go to the line but they had too many sgts. so several of us had to drop one today. We are not allowed to go into Etaples but it is the dirtiest place ever you saw.
