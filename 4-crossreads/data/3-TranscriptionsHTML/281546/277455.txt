<p>and then on my way to see my Sister, I visited Selfridges large Emporium in Oxford Street first to see the Huge Handley Page Aeroplane containing room for 17 People and the Mechanic's.  Only the Body was on view and splendidly finished. The Passenger space is about 40 ft by 5 ft and there are 17 Leather Arm Chairs and sitting in three were three young Ladies dressed in the latest fashions of Aeroplane <strike>costumes</strike> Suits of Brown Leather and Caps to match, they all looked very nice in their Suits, the Crowds were directed along and around and then away. I spent over an hour strolling about on different Floors inspecting the different departments, which were well stocked with different wares, and the staff were all kept busy. I could not help admiring the beautiful Costumes and Hats of the latest fashions. I then went around and spent an hour with my Sister, and away then for Tea, afterwards making for Liecester Square</p>
