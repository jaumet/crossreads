<p>1918<br/>Wed 3rd Apl.<br/>We passed through St Pauli again, it's slatternly, kimona-clad and rouged inhabitants looking by no means fascinating as they waddled to the bakers for their allowanced loaf.</p>
<p>Hamburg itself is a beautiful city, some of the canal scenes being quite Venetian.</p>
<p>The Inner Alster in particular is very beautiful.</p>
<p>From the main Bahnhof we left in the Overhead for Altona, boarding a train there bound for Hannover.   When the Hannover train reached Hamburg it was commandeered for troops by a shrieking brass-hatted Hun &amp; everybody (including us) was bundled out on to the platform, the train being then packed with troops en route to strengthen the line at Metz.</p>
