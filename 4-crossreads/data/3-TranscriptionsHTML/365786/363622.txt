<p>Strathfield Red + 13/3/16</p>
<p>When one of our men is wounded, he is first attended to by his own mates or any Army Medical Corps men who happen to be handy &amp; hurried back to the nearest dressing station.  There a Doctor binds up his wounds, checks haemorrhage etc. &amp; sends him back to the Field Ambulance.  This is a series of tents arranged like a small hospital, <strike>having</strike> &amp; has in war time a personel of 240 (or thereabouts), Doctors &amp; Orderlies, stretcher bearers etc. but no nurses.  Here <strike>small</strike> necessary amputations take place &amp; cases requiring immediate operation are attended to &amp; from here the <strike>cases</strike> patients are drafted to hospital ships &amp; sent to the big base hospitals &ndash; far from the battlefield where the men get every attention &amp; <strike>hope</strike> have the comfort of an ordinary hospital, thanks mainly to the Red Cross Society which supplies</p>
