<p>Red Cross &amp; Y.M.C.A.</p>
<p>To the Editor "The Egyptian Gazette"</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In regard to the discussion on the above subject that has appeared from time to time in the columns of your paper &amp; which was initiated by an "Australian woman" drawing public attention to the donation of &pound;500 by the Australian Red Cross Society to the Y.M.C.A. building fund &ndash; it appears to me that the whole question resolves itself into this bald statement of facts :-</p>
<p>(1) the sum of &pound;10,000 was subscribed by the people of Australia &amp; was officially earmarked for the purchase of comforts for <u>Australian</u> soldiers &amp; for them alone.<br/>(2) part of this sum has been donated to the Y.M.C.A. building fund.</p>
<p>Admitting unreservedly that the Y.M.C.A. has done excellent work for our Australian soldiers &amp; even granting that our men have been supplied with Red Cross comforts there is no justification for this distribution of money to be used for a purpose other than that for which it was specifically intended.</p>
<p>We know that the people of Australia provided the wherewithal to ensure</p>
<p>(1)  that our wounded en route from the Dardanelles to the Base here in Egypt should be well supplied with bandages &amp; dressings, pillows &amp; pyjamas,</p>
