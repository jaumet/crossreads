  
 stuff today. The goods received were very mixed & assorted so bundles of equal value were made up & then we drew fro them. My lot consisted of one towel, one pair socks, 1 bottle sauce & small writing tablet. Weather mild & dull. Thursday 9th. Spent a bad morning, severe headache etc. but it went off by midday & I felt well enough to do some washing. Usual duties in the morning. Played "house" after tea & had a good time ending up by losing 1/- worth it for a night's amusement. Friday 10th Felt much better quite lively in fact. Much cheered up by receiving my Xmas Cards from London done to my own design. They have turned out splendidly. Decided to send in my application for transfer to N.1 A.S.H as dispenser by arrangement with the new O.C. Had he been here before I should now be with them. Weather still fine  & mild very enjoyable. Indications of expected big move increasing daily. I trust it will be successful.
