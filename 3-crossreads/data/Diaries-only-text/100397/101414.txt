France April 26th ? 16
Dear Bett.
I have very little news just now Things are quiet here, and [indecipherable] not too brisk, and the weather, well since we landed on this side we have only enjoyed about 4 fine days. The rest have been cold and wet weather something like, that which you had on the Hastings, just before you went to Sydney and mud well I never saw mud before I landed here, the place is all mud water a trifle different to Egypt, the last two days however have improved things and the ground is drying steadily I hope this fine weather continues for a while it will improve things greatly I suppose there are a good bundle of letters etc waiting for me somewhere. I have only received one since I landed over here and it was written in Dec. 1915 so there must be quite a pile on the way When you see Mrs Harris again you can tell her that L.C. Hall is attached to this Batt. as Signaller I see him sometimes. "I also met one of the men who was at Lone Pine, and was in the same Platoon as Jack. he knew Jack and told me that there was absolutely no doubt about Jack he was killed by a shell just near the trenches, when the charge was made. "You can see what Mother thinks before you tell Mrs. Harris this".- A little over a fortnight ago we had some lovely weather, a regular French mixture wind, snow rain combined I can tell you it was pleasant, I dont think, France is a lovely country, but, when cold and wet is just as miserable a place
