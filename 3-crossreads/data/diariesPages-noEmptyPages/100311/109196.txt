1/10/17 Esplanade Saps Ypres
Aircraft very active last night and while at a conference with the General at BdeHQ one dropped a couple of large ones close to us covering everyone with dust and dirt. A noisy night. At dawn very heavy barrages were put down. The day was very fine. Orders arrived and summoned all officers together and discussed them with everyone. We also got plenty of maps and photographs. All the men hard at work getting issued with their fighting gear ? bombs entrenching implements etc.The modern soldier goes into action loaded up like a pack mule. At 9.30 sharp our extremely heavy practice barrage commenced and continued for an hour. The Hun retaliation was said to be weak. It is something to be once more quartered in the historic town of Ypres ? the one time Oxford of Belgium ? now white ruin waste. During the afternoon the officers got their men in groups with maps aeroplane photos and went over the operation. Today we have excellent photographs taken as recently as yesterday over Hunland by the R.F.G.
