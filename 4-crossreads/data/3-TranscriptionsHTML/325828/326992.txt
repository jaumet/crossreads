<p>by Lieut. Robinson at Cuffley some few months ago.   If I get back to Australia with it it will rank among one of my best souvenirs "a la guerre."  I have been to a good number of the picture shows in London &amp; they are fine especially the music.<br/>I return to France on Tuesday next, &amp; can assure you I am not looking forward to it at all.  I have been having a thorough holiday since I've been over here instead of rushing like mad all over the country.<br/>I have been to the Bank every day to see if the remittance I cabled for, has come through but up till yesterday it hadn't, so I believe the Sydney Bank are holding it up.  I ran right out of funds about three days ago, &amp; am just hanging on as best I can in the hope that it will come through before I return.  Our Agent General for N.S.W can't do anything neither will the Head Quarters of the A.I.F. although they have got a complete hold on us whilst we are in the Military.  However it will all come right</p>
