<p>23.9.16 Saturday</p>
<p>It turned out a bitterly cold morning &amp; I can tell you there was some sting in the water when having a wash. A German Taube  paid us a visit this morning &amp; to our surprise there was an Anti Aircraft Gun right alongside our Camp &amp; the way the shells screamed through the air was a treat. They got all round him &amp; we were cheering them every time they got closer but I fancy we would have cheered the other side of our faces if he had given us a bomb dropping exhibition. However 2 of our Battle Planes came up &amp; he ran for it &amp; we finally lost sight of them banking round one another in the distance. It is thrilling to watch an Aeroplane duel, everyone gets so excited &amp; when our chaps score a hit they go mad. Taking them all through we hold supremacy of the air as they always run when they sight our planes. I was watching them descend and ascend at the Aerodrome the other day &amp; they came down &amp; go up by dozen. How it is they do not collide with one another is a mystery to me.</p>
<p>We are all amazed by rats in this place &amp; on speaking to some Canadians who vacated this Camp they told us that all the way from here to Loos is overrun with them</p>
