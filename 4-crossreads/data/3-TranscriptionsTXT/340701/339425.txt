 Sunday 24-9-16 Rily [?] St. job again tonight. 
 Tuesday 26-9-16 Yesterday &amp; today working in secret trench which is a secret no longer.  Fritz put over a few shells (small ones) this morning. One lodged right in the trench &amp; buried Freddy Harden.  It took about 15 minutes to dig Fred out.  His helmet saved a little air for him &amp; he supervised matters from below, it sounded very strange to hear his muffled voice saying "more air" etc.  He was uninjured, his face being slightly swollen &amp; nose or mouth bleeding slightly. I believe Fritz caught one or two of our planes today.  There is going to be an Artillery stunt this evening.  Payday today.  One of the Boys got drunk &amp; being unable to balance himself on the W.C. perch fell backwards with appalling results. 
 [Frederick Harden, No 1939, 2nd Pioneer Battn.] Friday 29-9-16 L/M &amp; Claire Met H. Crothers the other day.  Heard that H. Hook was Killed at Fler Bain while working Trench Mortar.  The 18th organised a raid last night which was a failure.  They run into a bombing post &amp; were bombed back.  Our fellows used a 192 lbs Trench Mortar against Fritz
