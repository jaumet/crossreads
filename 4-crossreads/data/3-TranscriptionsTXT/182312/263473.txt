  15th February, 1917 :&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking across these peaceful snowfields one 
 finds it hard to realise that but a few months ago they were the 
 scene of some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting the war has 
 seen.&nbsp; Here were villages, factories, woods, cemeteries, roads 
 and railways;&nbsp; now all has been levelled and what traces there 
 still are of former days have been covered by a couple of feet of 
 glistening snow.&nbsp; The wet weather has caused most of the old 
 trenches to fall in, and even where a particularly well made trench 
 has withstood the weather it is now full of frozen water and being 
 snowed over is unrecognisable as a trench. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one gets closer to the present firing line, however, 
 this peacefulness gradually merges into activity of a military 
 nature.&nbsp; The French population had not been allowed back so that 
 no attempt has been made to rebuild villages but in their place 
 are camps, workshops, dumps, railways and the thousand and one 
 things required behind an army in the field.&nbsp; Streams of vehicles 
 of all classes occupy the numerous strategic roads day and night 
 carrying amuntiion and supplies to the armies in the line.&nbsp; Baths 
 have been erected where men fresh from the trenches can have a 
 bath and obtain clean underclothes for their old ones.&nbsp; Soup 
 kitchens are dotted along the roads to the front line where tired 
 troops returning from the trenches may obtain a mug of soup anytime 
 during the day or night free of charge.&nbsp; Everywhere is activity 
 and everywhere are soldiers all bent on making this the last year of war. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A visit to the Australians old Battlefields at 
 Pozieres was of interest even though not many of the old spots 
 were recognisable.&nbsp; Occasionally a familiar object would be found
