At last I am away with a draft.Left Acoz with our portion of the No 10 Quota & put up for the night at Corp Concentration Camp at Marcinelle, Charleroi.
Thurs Feb 13th:-Left Charleroi by train after getting a "Tea Leaved" lot of "Johnnie Walker" aboard. Passed through Mons, Valenciennes, St Ghislan & Amiens.
Fri Feb 14th:-Pulled up at a siding near Havre & marched to the Aust Gen Base depot late tonight.
Sun Feb 16th:-The tents in this camp are in a filthy condition with the old gear, food & blankets lying about & the wet conditions. A number of us are lying out with the flu & we are chary about reporting sick as the draft is liable to move across to Eng at any time & so we would miss it.
Mon 17th Feb:-Still got the dog's disease but hanging out in case the quota moves.
