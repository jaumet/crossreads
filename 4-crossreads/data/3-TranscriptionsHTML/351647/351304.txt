<p>Our boys still doing well.</p>
<p>a/d<br/>H.Q.<br/>5th F.A. Brigade<br/>A.I.F.<br/>France.</p>
<p>Field<br/>30 August 1916</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Am afraid I've been some time writing you, up till just lately I've felt anyhow &amp; simply couldn't rake up any energy at all &amp; if I had to do something well I just used to do it &amp; then flop on my back gracefully &amp; gratefully directly it was finished &amp; proceed to do absolutely nothing.  I did feel rotten &amp; the weather was rotten &amp; flies were rotten &amp; everything.  However that's all over, I've been shifted back to my old beloved Brigade, not in the old Battery but in the Head Quarters this time.  And I'm Brigade clerk &amp; promoted to Corporal &amp; Acting Sergeant &amp; a very important bloke so I'm doing well in my slow old way.  I didn't do any engineering either, the people here asked for me &amp; although the D.A.C. folk didn't seem inclined to let me go well they just had to.  Thank Gawd.</p>
<p>The weather is still particularly vile &amp; the conditions of living aren't too good still, I'm not growling at all.  We live in dugouts.</p>
