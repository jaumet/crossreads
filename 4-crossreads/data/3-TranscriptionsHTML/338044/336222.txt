<p>at Lyons &amp; take a train &amp; bus back to Strand in time to get to the Hippodrome  Matinee "Joyland". A fine theatre &amp; we get a good seat in the stalls  I thoroughly enjoy the whole performance, it is really great   The scenery, in my opinion, is the best I've seen. Having Tate's witticism is great    &amp; the Empire Tableau is fine. Needless to say Australia's flag is much applauded also Canada's &amp; the other Colonies   I leave satisfied. Walk to the Strand &amp; take a taxi to Headqus &amp; report at 5 pm. As usual a further wait  &amp; we are to report at 5 pm to-morrow. After  obtaining a further extension of leave pass, I again accompany Lake, at his request, to his home &amp; take the train from Waterloo  &amp; after some more music    &amp; another pleasant evening, have a good stiff hot lemon &amp; whisky    &amp; some medicine</p>
