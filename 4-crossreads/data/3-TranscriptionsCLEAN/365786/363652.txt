From the parapet at the western angle of the mosque a magnificent view of Cairo may be obtained.  One sees spread out the yellowish grey city with its countless minarets, domes & gardens.  It's medly collection of houses is seen & the hum of it's swarming population rises to one's ears.

Several times I went out to the Pyramids & one beautiful moonlight night we saw the Sphinx - our soldiers called it seeing the Minx by Spoonlight.
