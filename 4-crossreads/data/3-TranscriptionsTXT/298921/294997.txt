 January, 1915 Sunday 24 After all I did not post these notes at Aden as we only stayed a few hours &amp; did not go ashore. This morning we are in the Red Sea &amp; many boats of many nationalities pass us including a patrolling Cruiser, keeping the trade Routes open. A P &amp; O Mail boat also passed, we exchanged greetings &ndash; The Coast is rugged &amp; date palms grow at intervals. Patients in hospital are better I am glad to say
