 Tuesday 10 July 1917. 
 In hospital. Feeling pretty good &amp; expect to be out tomorrow. Things as usual in the camp. Rumored that the mail closes tonight so must get to work on the letters. 
 &quot;Tommy&quot; camp practically empty now. Geo. Cameron got 2 S.B.&amp;M. Journal papers &amp; I read these also &quot;Herald&quot; dated 26th May. Sgt. Browne got &quot;Argus&quot; dated 17th &amp; 26th May &amp; saw these also. Saw where Pat Lynch has died of wounds in hospital in France on May 6th 1917. He was wounded 5 months ago.
