<p>Tuesday 30 April 1918<br/>H.A.P. with Addie, in air 3 h. 5 m.<br/>Patrolled over the L.H. [Light Horse] as they attacked Es Salt.  No Huns came over.<br/>Addie was lying in his tent when a B.F. taking off crashes into it, was lucky to escape with his life, goes to hospital with a bust knee cap.</p>
<p>Wednesday 1 May 1918<br/>2 B.F.s missing today, no news so far.<br/>Went to see Addie in hospital at Ludd.<br/>Awfully sorry to loose my pilot for a time as Addie is unbeatable in the air and we know one another so well.</p>
