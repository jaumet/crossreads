<p>handed in; Thank goodness I can have a couple of spare sets carried &amp; send it back to the Frenchies to be rinsed, &quot;Washing done for Soldiers&quot; is a big business here &amp; signs setting that forth are everywhere in rear of forward areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Same job as before &quot;Scout Officer&quot; it suits me for very few officers know anything about N.M.L. &amp; I am usually left to do my little job without interference of course were it done other than well I would hear about it, but as it is <s>ther</s> I work out my little game as I will &amp; nobuddy sez neithink to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few days time I&#39;m off for a weeks instructing, a British Brigade has requested my services &amp; so away I go again&nbsp; What an awful thing it is to be so famous. Eh!</p>
