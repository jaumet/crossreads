<p>Friday 19 October 1917<br/>And for the last time we go down the hold &amp; do a final packing at our boxes.<br/>Very hot &amp; thousands of tiny waves sparkle in the sun like so many gum leaving [leaves ?] dancing in the wind when the sun shines after a shower in our own dear Australia.  Ships appear on the horizon now &amp; <strike>tiny</strike> fishing boats &ndash; dhows &ndash; stand like tiny fairy things on the edge of the world (as we have seen it for 5 weeks now).<br/>S. Watson improves slightly.  T. down 99 degrees.<br/>Sleeping on deck tonight &amp; oh, how stifling is the cabin.  Today a large yellow butterfly fluttered by the Ayrshire's side, and dolphins (?) great blue green fish spring in the air after our tiny flying fish.</p>
