<p>not so high or majestic as old Gib looks, we had not long been anchored when motor boats came rushing up with health officers &amp; etc   the "Sandgropers" were very excited at the thought of getting home  some of them had been up half the night getting ready,  about 8 'oclock the townspeople got wind that we were in the "Sound" &amp; a boat came alongside us with a lot of girls on, these were the first "Aussie" girls that we had seen &amp; I could not help noticing how brown &amp; tanned they were after being among the English girls for so long but still to me they were a fine sight &amp; one felt home once more   the boat they were in brought us potatoes &amp; fruit &amp; the girls also sent a lot of oranges cigarettes &amp; such like to us</p>
