<p>Wednesday 11 June 1919<br/>Heavy thunder storm early this morning. Naturally there is plenty of rain. Had a hair cut today &amp; go in tomorrow to get my hair treated. Ernest &amp; I went to Renfrew by train. It is along the Clyde. Saw all the shipbuilding yards. Came home by crossing the river in a ferry &amp; getting the train back. Everywhere one goes here there is one mass of children playing in the streets. The majority too are filthy dirty.</p>
<p>Thursday 12 June 1919<br/>Wrote 8 pages home to all today. Very heavy thunder storm lightening &amp; rain was very good. I enjoyed it. Met Moffitt in the afternoon &amp; had tea with him. Went in to the hairdresser &amp; got some advice about my hair. Harriet came out &amp; she, Ernest &amp; I went to the pictures &amp; then took her home. Was quite decent coming back. Rain had stopped.</p>
