 Wednesday 5 December 1917. 
 In bivouac 1 mile from main Jaffa road but hardly yet out of range of Jacko&#39;s Jack Johnsons  6  5.9 inch Howitzer guns, but partly protected by sand dunes right against our position. 
 Watered camels &amp; filled fantasies at Richon Zion village which is the best village we have come across. People mostly French &amp; well spoken. 
 Had a look round the shops and bought figs,  &amp;  almonds &amp; bread. 
 Back to bivouac at 12.15 pm. On picquet from 1 till 2 pm. 
 Saddle up (full gear) &amp; moved off at dusk. Travelled to Richon Zion &amp; straight onward &amp; now getting  well  away  at  from&nbsp;the sound of guns etc. A relief too. Travelled till midnight. 
 Rain started near Tebna.
