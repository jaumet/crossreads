lying about this morn.  The country is very wet & flooded in many places.  Wen we got on the boat were given a ticket with no. of table & mess deck & told to wait at the table untill we got a meal.  It came allong in time quite a decent feed.  If we get our scale of rations as given in a list we should do fairly well.
The blankets & hamocks were rushed so quite a lot of us got none.  After some trouble we managed to get at least 2 blankets
