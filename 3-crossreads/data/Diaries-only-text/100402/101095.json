At 6 a.m. this morning our guns opened in a heavy barrage and an hour later the Tommies on our right went over advanced about 3000 yards taking prisoners and guns. Our chaps followed up on their left at 10 a.m. and apparently linked up it is rumoured that they took 40 prisoners and machine guns. Certainly prisoners were taken as we saw them come through Borre. Still glorious weather prevails. This evening Fritz is shelling between Borre Pradelles heavily. Our American attaches went away to-day.
Ye Gods! the 10th did another hop over at 6 p.m. to-night and got all objectives, a subsidiary affair to the attack on the right by 31st Division. Casualties have not been extraordinarily heavy.

Still glorious weather at Borre to-night we moved up the line again to Strazeele Station again. Things have not been too quiet of late but everything is very still to-night.
This post is no good now because it has become H.Q.'s for battn. sigs. they have almost ousted us from the post.
