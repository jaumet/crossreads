<p>curious existence this military one and each chap in the A.I.F. plays many parts in doing his daily work.&nbsp; Oh yes, and there are baths , just across the road where A.Coy will bathe tomorrow.&nbsp; Good little baths too, there are showers and though the flow of water is not large one can get clean and also a washed (not clean) set of underclothing, it may be verminous but is usually better than the one handed in, thank goodness I can carry a couple of spare sets and send them back to the French to wash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 24th I am off to the Tommies again for about a week to assist in the preparation of a raid, rather a compliment eh, to be asked for again and it is nearly twelve months since the last time I was with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now I am living at the transport lines and as I had a bit of a cough and was losing my voice, <s>so</s> the dear old Major sent me away from the underground <sub>^</sub><sup>for</sup> three days hol-iday, no job and no responsibility he told me, and here I am, just on top of that comes the invitation of the Tommies so it never rains but it pours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Best wishes from,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
