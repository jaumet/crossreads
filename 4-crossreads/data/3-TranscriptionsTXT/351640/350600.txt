 [Act V, Scene 2; Lines 57-58, 68-71 and 95-97:] "Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, The sciences that should become our country." 
 "King Hy. If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace, Whose want gives growth to the imperfections Which you have cited, you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands 
 "... Our cousin Katherine, here with us, She is our capital demand, comprised Within the forefront of our articles."

 The same fertile feilds, as so oft before in the centuries that have gone, are the place of carnage where grim visaged war holds sway.  Alas in this 20th Century man is as ever, prepared to fight for right or a grand mistake, for women or territory.  There be some good people, in Sydney they were but few months or years back, who formed themselves into a Peace Society, their act of faith being:&ndash; "Men &amp; women are becoming too civilised to ever again make war, or kill one another for any purpose".

 [Rose Scott (1847-1925), feminist, pacifist, law reformer and women's activist, was born in Singleton, NSW. She was a founding member of the Women's Literary Society (1889) and founding secretary of the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales (1891). David Scott Mitchell, whose collection forms the basis of the Mitchell Library, part of the State Library of NSW, was her cousin.
