<p>Saturday 27 May 1916<br/>A perfect day. Soon after breakfast Leo put in an appearance, looking well &amp; fit : thought he had gone to London &amp; was surprised to see him. He knew where Rid was billeted &amp; together we walked out the couple of miles thro' glorious country. Cereal crops from a foot to two feet high &amp; beautifully green : potatoes strong &amp; healthy, the rows being hilled at the time : beans in rows 10" apart just thro' : peas in full bloom, having a general white colour : marigolds 6" high &amp; just thinned out : clover 15" to 18" high &amp; in bloom. All these crops looked their best. Peaceful farm-houses nestling among poplars, elms or beeches broke into the landscape here &amp; there, the green hawthorn hedges picking out the roads leading to or past them. Found Rid at home &amp; after a minute we all walked home to Sailly together, Rid wheeling a bike on which to ride home. In the afternoon censoring letters &ndash; then had to bike down to a spot where the night's fatigue was to be done. After tea marched down there &amp; kept the party busy clearing trenches until 1 a.m., reaching home an hour later just as dawn was lighting up the east.</p>
