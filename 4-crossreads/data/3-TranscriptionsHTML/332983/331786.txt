<p>with fair results, a few sets dirty. The Navy is doing good work in and around our way. Preparations are being made here for winter quarters. A prisoner (Sloane) awarded 3 days C.B. Absent from early morning stables. We are expecting a big move in a day or two. We have been stock taking. 3rd Battery shoeing smith sick going away, My S.S. has been sick, he is in bad health, asking for a spell at Alexandria exchange with shoeing smith Elphick. The shells are coming over thick and heavy, high explosives 6 in very good bursts<br/>2/9/1915<br/>Rather cool today, wind eased off a little. Rifle fire strong all night, artillery fire at frequent intervals. First shot over this morning 6.30. A list of all horses out of condition, to be taken and forwarded to Vet officer today. It is likely that they will be sent to Alexandria rest camp. Some high explosives shells over from the Asiatic side, a deadly gun gives you no warning, you hear a scream and a second after, a frightful explosion. I have seen with my own eyes pieces of these shells falling half a mile from where the shell burst. They say it is a Naval gun off the Goebin.</p>
