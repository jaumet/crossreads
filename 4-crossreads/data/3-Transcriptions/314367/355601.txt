<p>Sunday<br/>13-12-14  A hot stuffy Saty night &amp; the Fantome rolled, rolled, rolled &ndash; Clean white suits all round today &amp; the Captain goes the Rounds &amp; anyone who isnt up to the mark gets 'Scrubbed'. All went well &amp; then we had prayers &amp; then 'Fall out' &ndash; I've informed my SBA that when I say 8.30 for Sick Parade &ndash; I mean it - The blighter got my tongue sorely this morning for being late &ndash; I dont want any excuses &ndash; I want punctuality &ndash; I read Spectators &amp; played Bridge till lunch &amp; now I'm writing my journal &ndash; No press news &ndash; not a vessel seen &ndash; We are about? 100 miles off Wrossel Island &ndash; S of N. Guinea &ndash; We expect to be in Rabaul on W-day by noon &ndash;</p>
<p>Monday<br/>11-12-14  Mab is 20 &ndash; Dear girl &ndash; I'm very fond of her &ndash; We must all have a stunt together somewhere when I come back &ndash; I like this life but I also like home life &ndash; What's the news? &ndash; Nothing doing &ndash; We're somewhere close up to Wrossel  Island &ndash; We're a week out &ndash; All goes well &ndash; The Fantome in every way is far before the Upolu &ndash; Ship is far superior &ndash; Discipline is A1 &ndash; No gooning &ndash; All goes as smooth as oil &ndash; Sick parade was sharp on 8.30 this morning &ndash; By Jove we rolled last eveg. We took both Port &amp; Sherry Decanters at dinner &amp; one terrific roll took nearly half the things off our table &ndash; No fresh meat, no decent</p>
