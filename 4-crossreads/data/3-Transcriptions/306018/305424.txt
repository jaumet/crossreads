<p>April 1917<br/>out on patrol &amp; made a big circling screen to the South &amp; East.  We saw no sign of the enemy but came across some sheep &amp; goats &amp; secured three  They made very good eating &amp; a change from the eternal "bully" we have had of late.  After breakfast we took our horses to water &amp; we all had a bath.  It was greatly appreciated as it was nearly a fortnight since the last &amp; the dirt was accumulating fast.  The heat was very intense again &amp; it was a relief to get through the day.</p>
<p>Thursday 26th<br/>Had a fairly easy day again but it was far from comfortable on account of the heat.  There was steady gun fire near Gaza all day.  Can't get any news of what is happening.  At dusk we were relieved by the Yeomanry &amp; came in to Weli Sheikh Nuran &amp; had a good nights rest.</p>
<p>Friday 27th<br/>Got our horses some good grazing.  In the afternoon we cleaned out trenches.  B Troop were in the trenches at night.  There was fairly continuous gun fire  near Gaza all night.</p>
<p>Saturday 28th<br/>B Squadron went to the Shagar [?] cisterns &amp; were all day emptying</p>
