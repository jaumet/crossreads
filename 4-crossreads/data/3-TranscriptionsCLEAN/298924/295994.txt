  
 Sunday 12 January 1919 Our Y.M.C.A. Church Service, Padres all gone home.  Rained hard but I am in a Bell tent.  Posted you my Diary today.  Letters from Australia delivered just after posting diary - 2 from Mother Nov. 10th and Nov. 24th with Diary printed. Dolly likes to get them sent on to her.  Also 2 letters from May & 1 from Lorna.  Papers no doubt will follow. Played Bridge last night with some Gunners. I find you & Day & May had all influenza & only hope no ill effects.  We are a good constitutioned family.  I could never have come into what we have done had it been otherwise & thanks to your early care of we children.
