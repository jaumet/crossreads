  
 February 1919 1st.  My Paris pass is a long time coming through. 3rd.  Paris pass arrives at last and to-morrow I will catch the Cologne-Boulogne Express as far as Arras. 4th.  Leave Charleroi at 6 p.m. and travell all night in guards van. 5th.  Am in Paris, but after a most awful journey of 28 hours.  We took just 24 hours to get to Arras, when it was snowing heavily, but by luck I caught a train for Paris arriving there at 9.30 p.m.
