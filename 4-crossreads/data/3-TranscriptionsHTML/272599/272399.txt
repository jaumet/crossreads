<p>1917 Tuesday 8 May</p>
<p>Morning duties. Afternoon off  Tog up &amp; go into Boulogne. Plenty  to interest one round the docks, troops arriving hospital ships leaving for Blighty, submarines, &amp; destroyer escorts &ndash; a busy &amp; everchanging scene. Boulogne is the main artery connecting France &amp; England. <br/>Jock Heylin joins me later &amp; we go to French Cinema at the "Theatre Municiple" a pretty little theatre it proved to be. Spent an enjoyable 2 hours there then home in time to sign off at 9 p.m.</p>
