Saturday 8 June
The "Tock Emma" fired to-day, a projectile 150 pounds in weight. From Strazeele heights a great view is to be had of the surrounding country almost back to Estaires. Quiet to-day with glorious weather. Several fires have been caused by shelling of farm houses.
Cook to-day.
Sunday 9 June
Glorious weather still continues, we are living very well indeed. The Bosch hit one of our outhouses early this morning.
