  
 15 May, 1916 We left Romanai at about 2.0 oclock one reg of New Zealanders & the 6th & proceeded to Katia; here we watered & boiled our quarts & had a good tea - Joe woods had boiled a piece of bacon & it went well - a bit after six we saddled & moved off again, it was quite pleasant riding along in the cool moon light night  After about 5 or 6 miles we halted again & re filled our water bottles & fed up  & did not remove our saddles - later we took our horses around to a well & gave them a drink, when we came back the section opened some bully & we had a snack then lay down with the reins hooked over our arms & tried to get some sleep - the horses were very quiet & I was awakened only too or three times with the horses tramping up against my shin bones, then there would be a little language & I would go off to sleep again
