Thurs 22 Wed. 21-6-‘16
marching close to hedges at about 30 paces interval. We passed thru a mined village (Pictures recalled London Illust. & Cinema). One corner, where was an old Church in ruins, we came under fire from M. Gun Traversing. Bulletts whissed overhead nearly all the way & buried themselves in the road all around. It was dark when we came behind the firing line about 1000 yds. From the Huns. Flares lit up the snakelike formation of 
the fatigue party = 100 or more men of all regiments. We halted at 3 paces interval & then I noticed that we formed a line from our own front line back.
