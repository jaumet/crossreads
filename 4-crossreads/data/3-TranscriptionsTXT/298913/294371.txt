During the afternoon we saw a native funeral. This is rather comical to watch. First of all go the man's property &ndash; generally  a few donkeys, then natives singing or rather howling, to keep the spirits away. Next comes the coffin &ndash; a kind of a box with the corpse in it, borne on the shoulders of a dozen men. The coffin is open - &amp; covered with a cloth &amp; a piece of wood projects upwards from the head. On this piece of wood is the deceased man's Taboosh (red fez cap) &ndash; Eric says he could not go to Peter without a " tile " on.
