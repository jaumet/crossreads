[Friday 31 March 1916]
Scotchmen treat me very well & I'm quite happy in my new job.  Cold better, & plenty of work.Near here are antiquities & Tombs with the bones of many past generations I have not had time to explore yet.I am posting you some Negatives, which you have printed if you like, but P.O.P has become so dear & scarce in Egypt that I send you the Films only I have labeled the Films what they represent.Many good Films are spoilt by the Native photographers as Developing Mixtures are almost unobtainable in Egypt.
