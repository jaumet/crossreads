<p>Sunday 16<br/>Move from Senleques to Warrams. Snowing tonight &amp; prospects of more tomorrow.</p>
<p>Monday 17<br/>A very cold night last night. Move today to Wizernes &amp; there entrain, disentrain at Ballieul &amp; thence to Danoutre, about ten kilos behind the line at Messines. The bombardment on the left, Ypres is fairly heavy</p>
<p>Tuesday 18<br/>Rumour has it that the Germans are going to make an attack on this front. Certainly the artillery is very active, day &amp; night.</p>
<p>Thursday 20<br/>A very heavy hoar frost to-day &amp; tonight &amp; the hedges etc are covered with frost crystal. No rain &amp; the ponds etc are frozen over</p>
<p>Friday 21<br/>Visit Ballieul again. The town is the same as of old. French customs are queer. To-day I saw a man carrying an empty coffin under one arm &amp; the cross under the other. The effect of this hoar frost is just fairy like, beautiful.</p>
<p>Saturday 22<br/>Visit 9th Field Ambulance &amp; have tea with Verne Cocks &amp; quite a good yarn. En route passed through old haunts, Neuve Eglise &amp; Steenwerck.  Still freezing</p>
