<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find it a great old comforter.  I forgot to say these gifts they gave out were A.M.C Comforts.  We get some terrific winds here during the day &amp; clouds upon clouds of dust, sand &amp; grit.  I am in comfortable quarters here &amp; the tucker is good.<br/>I am keeping a look out for Walter but it is only chance that I will run against him.<br/>There is very little news that we are able to write.<br/>Am generally glad to get to bed early as we are up about 6.<br/>Must close now with love to all at home.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Leo<br/>Thanks for spare paper &amp; envelope will use them next time.  Have plenty to go on with.</p>
