August 1915fatigue.  The mail was distributed in the afternoon.  I got letters from Violet Blair Kate & Doug, also an "Illustrated War News"  Wrote a letter to Violet.  Had a yarn with Harold Jones at night.  He has been here a fortnight now with reinforcements for the 7th LH.  Went for a dip in the briny after tea.  We had a little rain during the night.  About 10 or 11 oclock there was a tremendous outburst of rifle & machine gun fire, also bombs & it lasted quite while.  Seemed to be on the left of the Lone Pine.
Friday 27thAbout stand-to in the morning there was another burst of fire.  Seems as if they are doing some scrapping on the left.  The weather is still cloudy & cool.  We heard that Italy has declared war on Turkey & that Greece & Bulgaria may come in at any moment.  We won't be sorry
