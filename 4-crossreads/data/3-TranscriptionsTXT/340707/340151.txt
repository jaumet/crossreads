25The heavenly chorus of girls gives a noisy display with tambourines & the audience is informed that search is finished, & they must return to earth receiving a blessing at foot of stairs I forgot to mention that St Peter with his crook welcomed us at door on entering & conducted us into heaven.
After this we adjourned to Le Chat Noir a much more interesting show. Price of admission is 1.85 & beer costs 75 centimes & was flat. On entering we were greeting with a remark Here are live real Parisians All girls are addressed as Princess, soldier as generals & civilians as monseigneur & some remark passed about each. A lady accompanied by 2 men enter, & are introduced as the man his wife & the baby. A front man entering introduces himself as the l'amant.
The songs are rather good & at conclusion singers try to sell them. There seem to be 4 male & 1 finale singer & a pianist. How it pays I dont know. The method of acclamation is directed by one of show & many be a succession of 3, 4 or 5 claps repeated 3, 4 or 5 times. The shallow shows are over the odds of the soldier who sees a girl & [indecipherable] much movement after which a duel & then his funeral.
Some of the songs are very hot & much talk is of Americans
