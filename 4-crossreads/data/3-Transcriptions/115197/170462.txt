<p>for dear &quot;Old Blighty&quot; -&nbsp; Arrive at Dover at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>An incident concerning some Imperial Warrant Officers - as disgusting as it is contemptible.&nbsp; Arrive at Victoria and march to Horseferry Rd - after which I make for &quot;Elm Bank&quot; and arrive at my English Home more dead than alive.&nbsp; Mr &amp; Mrs Scales are away but Alice attends to me like a true nurse and after medical attention I go to bed and sleep soundly.</p>
