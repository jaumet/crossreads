<p>We got into touch &amp; were told to proceed to a place called Tel El Sheria[?] which we did. Going along the track there were dead &amp; wounded about &amp; we did what we could. We met a few who had lost touch of their units &amp; were on the same lay[?] as ourselves. After wandering about we decided to camp &amp; our S.M. proceeded to try &amp; get in touch with Headquarters. Failing in this we pushed on &amp; intended to strike Tel El Sheria[?] as quickly as possible. We very nearly met with disaster. Tel El Sheria[?] had not fallen and we would have probably rode into the Turkish lines. This would have meant capture or practically the total destruction</p>
