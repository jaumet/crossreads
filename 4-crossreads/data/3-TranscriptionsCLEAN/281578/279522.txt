  
 last night, as two shells fell right in their billets, & 19 men were killed, & 62 wounded. It is a cruel business, men back resting too, & it was bad luck getting fair on to the sheds they were sleeping in. We halted beside the Somme River about 9.30 a.m. under the lovely trees, & stayed there during the day. I had a sleep before dinner, & a dip in the swift flowing river in the afternoon, & feel nice & fresh. A gun is blazing away at the Huns with an awful roar near where we are. At 9 p.m. we marched off, went along a narrow road which ran along the bank of the river, & walked without a stop for 2 1/2 hours. We came (pen run dry) to Corbie, a nice town now deserted, crossed the river & various swamps by means of footbridges of wood, followed a track through long green grass, & trees, & eventually came to the position in reserves we took up. We had a very narrow squeak. Fritz sent some shells over just where my section passed half a minute before. We got against a bank by the sunken road, & more burst 10 yards or so in front of us, just where we had come past. A bit of stone hit me under the left eye, & further along the bank a chap was wounded in the leg by a piece of shell, & got a nice "Blighty". When the shells stopped we continued to the dugout we are
