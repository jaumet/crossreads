12/1/18 London
Cheshire Cheese and had some of the celebrated pudding, pancake and a half of bitter. Cost 4/6. evidently restrictions are touching them up and the place is going off. To Piccadilly and Leicester Square both dark comparatively and thronged with women. I should like to see all these places lit right up properly as in peace. The London policeman is a wonder and knows everything ? streets tubes bus numbers and has a courtesy that is unfailing. Back to hotel about 9.15. The bus ran into station yard and it was the Devils own job finding the hotel.
