<p>1917<br/>Thu  11th Oct.<br/>An alarm in the morning which turned out to be only practice;  but it sufficed to kill 2nd mate Johnson of the "Beluga".   Heart-failure.   Strange to say there are 13 of us at table (or were before he died.)</p>
<p>Fri 12th Oct.<br/>The body was laid on the hatch covered with an American flag and at 9 am he was buried from one of the gun-doors under the starboard gun.   We all dressed for the occasion (it was the first time most of us had had socks on for months).</p>
<p>The show of uniforms was rather dazzling, but most of them were well streaked with mildew and creases.   Capt. Olsen read a short service.   The "Hitachi" was met later in the morning and we patrolled in company.</p>
<p>There is no sign of any vessel so far &ndash; we are now in the vicinity of Mauritius.</p>
