<p>Shortly after 6 machines were wheeled out, four of the engines were started, and the machines 'taxied' out on to the aerodrome. Our machines went down and opened fire on the enemy machines, whereupon the motor car approached them and the engines were stopped. During this proceeding 600 rounds were fired at the machines and other targets.</p>
<p>Two days later the advanced aerodrom[e] at BALAATA and horse lines and camps along the BIREH-NABLUS road were attacked from low altitude, by the same pilots and observers. 1,300 rounds were fired and panic was produced in the various camps attached.</p>
<p>On the same day Lieuts. S.A. Nunan and R.S. Adair (Pilots) and E.A. Mulford D.C.M. and L.P. Kreig (Observers), while out on reconnaissance, went down a few hundred feet and attacked horse and camel transport in the WADI FARAH. Later in the day the same target was attacked by Lieuts. E.P. Kenny and P.J. McGinness, D.C. M. (Pilots) and L.W. Sutherland M.C. D.C.M. and H. Fysh (observers).  On each occasion horses stampeded, many were seen to fall and general panic prevailed. 1,850 rounds were fired into these targets.</p>
<p>While on the Eastern reconnaissance on the 12th Lieuts. P.J. McGinness, D.C.M.  (pilot) and H. Fysh (Observer) located 2,000 camels and 500 cavalry near KISSIR Station moving South, into which they fired 800 rounds. This target was bombed and machine gunned by a formation of our machines later in the day. Several direct hits were obtained, and the camels and horses dispersed in all directions, many being seen to fall. On the 15th the reconnaissance machine reported that the camels had been again collected and were moving Southward. They were again attacked and scattered 1,250 rounds being fired into them from our machines.</p>
<p>Camps, cavalry, trains and other ground targets were similarly attacked by our machines on several other occasions during the month.</p>
<p>On the 16th Capt. A.R. Brown and Lieuts. G.O. Peters (pilots) and Lieuts. G.  Finlay and J.H. Traill (observers) drove 4 Albatross Scouts down on to the aerodrome at TULKERAM. Enemy records, captured later revealed that all enemy machines were damaged by machine gun fire on this occasion.</p>
<p>Lieuts. C.S. Paul (pilot) and W.J.A. Weir (observer) chased an enemy machine (two-seater) to JENIN, but were unable to overtake it before it landed there. On the return journey they flew along several roads at low altitude and fired 1.450 rounds into various targets causing no small amount of commotion.</p>
<p>The same afternoon Lieut. A.V. Tonkin (pilot) and Lieut. A.V. McCann (observer) drove three enemy scouts down near NABLUS, and on this occasion also, according to enemy records, all enemy machines were hit by machine gun fire.</p>
<p>Later in the day two enemy two-seaters were driven down on to the AMMAN aerodrome by Lieuts. D.R. Dowling and G.V. Sheppard (pilots) and E.A. Mulford D.C.M. and L.P. Kreigh (Observers.)</p>
<p>On the following day two enemy scouts (Albatross) were met at 11.000 feet over BOREH by Capt. R.N. Smith M.C. (pilot) and Lieut. W.A. Kirk (observer). Both enemy machines were destroyed. The Officers concerned were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.</p>
<p>An enemy two-seater was shot down by Lieut. A.V. Tonkin (pilot) and Lieut. L.W. Sutherland M.C., D.C.M. (observer) on the 22nd. The enemy machine, close[l]y pursued by our machine, flew along a deep gorge about 20 feet above the ground. Lieut. Sutherland here fired a burst of 100 rounds into the enemy machine which crashed in the bed of a Wadi.</p>
<p>Acting upon information received from an Agent, a special reconnaissance of the country round ZIMMERIN was made by Lieut. E.P. Kenny (pilot) and Lieut. L.W. Sutherland M.C. , D.C.M. (observer) escorted by Lieut. C.S.  Paul (Pilot) and Lieut. W.J.A. Weir (Observer). It had been reported</p>
