<p>groin etc. hadn't let me down I would have been O.K. &amp; am not afraid of going back to the slush, in a couple of months the winter will be over &amp; spring &amp; summer here are delightful although I expect we will be very busy driving the Hun out in those seasons &amp; one sometimes get hurt in what we call these "thinning out parades" anyway luck is a fortune &amp; I am a "millionaire".<br/>I received a "Military Cross" the other day &amp; now walk a little more erect to throw a chest, to make the ribbon prominent. I feel awfully bucked about it dear as the Battalion only have five wearing that order &amp; we have had lots of officers, there is a devil of "drink up etc" waiting for me when I rejoin the old Bn. When I get to England again I will get the Cross from the King &amp; will send it to you to keep for me, am enclosing a piece of the ribbon. Your mail is again chasing me round the country &amp; when it turns up wont I have a time, it is now six weeks at least since I last heard from Australia.</p>
