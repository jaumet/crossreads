<p>I have been tonight how to play draughts &ndash; you would be amused if you saw me.<br/>I have read two of Masefield's books &ndash; Multitude &amp; Solitude &amp; Captain Margaret &ndash; I liked them both.<br/>Am reading the Price of Love by Arnold Bennet as usual he depresses [indecipherable] his sordidness.<br/>Dr Jekyl &amp; Mr Hyde I read without much interest.<br/>I have the Higher Critisism of the Bible on board in case I fall short of mental stimulus.<br/>Devoted love to you my precious mother. Do rest and come home refreshed &amp; strong.<br/>Devotedly your daughter Betha</p>
