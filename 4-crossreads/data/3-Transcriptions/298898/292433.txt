<p>However at 8 we had tea &amp; turned in shortly after 10 catching the 9.10 train in the morning back to London. I was very pleased I ran up as Will D. was there &amp; I was glad of the opportunity of seeing them again.</p>
<p>Monday 15th Jan.<br/>Spent Monday returning to London a trip I enjoyed altho. it was rather tiring. The whole country was covered deeply in snow &amp; was indeed a very pretty sight &amp; one quite new to me. Had lunch on the train, rather good. Returned to Hotel &amp; we went to the 9 oclock house of the Palladium rather poor on the whole. Supper on our return.</p>
<p>Tuesday 16th Jan.<br/>Went round flat hunting with friends, rather a quiet day. Went to see L.M. &amp; Co. &amp; saw Mr. Brown &amp; Thoroughgoods, very decent to me. Would do all they could. At night went to see "Theodore &amp; Co."</p>
