<p>128<br/>in charge of the Battalion sanitary arrangements, I used to get on fairly well with the R.S.M. whose name was Douglas and he put in the "recommend" I would have got the stripe this time. At this I was approached with reference to accepting the position of Company Clerk. Capt Hewish agreed that I should like it so I settled down. Percy Godbolt who nominated me for the vacancy was relinquishing the position on account of promotion. He gave me an insight into the working and left me to it. However at this position I was never comfortable, couldn't get into the work at all and it wasn't for want of trying either. I kept it altogether for 5 weeks but the work</p>
