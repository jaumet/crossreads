ever enjoy any trip as they always take you away from those you love or at least some of them.I long to know where you are settled. I hope at the flat and with Mrs Ed to do the work for you.As soon as I get to London I shall go to see Grandmother & Jocelyn & Rosamond - who may meet the ship - and then to Mr Colville to pay in money. I shall have &pound 14 to pay in which will leave me &pound 6. for the expenses on the voyage at Colombo etc and the tips - and immediate expenses in train fares etc in London. I get my mess allowance to the good on the ship.I wish you dear Dad would let me know how I stand with regards to you and what Mr Swifts account is. Then I shall know what to do and how extravagant I may be -
