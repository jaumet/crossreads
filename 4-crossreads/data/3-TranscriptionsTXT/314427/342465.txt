I was up about 6. this morning ,had an early breakfast & was ready to go on leave at 8.a.m. from the Orderly Room.We were driven to Weymouth station in a motor van. The train left about 9, and we passed through Dorchester Southampton, Winchester and numerous other stations arriving at Waterloo before two o'clock. From there I took the tube to Euston changing at Charing Cross and waited there for a boat train.
