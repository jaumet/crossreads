Beaucamps. Le. Vieux, Amiens 
5/2/17 gave the necessary sound. Usual advance in rushes from here to where they eventually dug in. The 37 m. gun was carried up on a cart. A day of a week being presumed a new regiment took over clad in fighting order. In a fixed signal they opened an intense fire with rifle grenades and machine guns while the 37 mm gun fired as hard as its gunners could load. The whole place was soon a mass of smoke and the opposing trenches quite blotted out. Then at a fixed signal they advanced crying "En Avant!" their Lewis gunners slightly in front spraying the ground with bullets. All halted a short distance from the trench and poured a barrage of hand grenades into it cleaning it up. First wave went right on and tackled second line while second and third cleaned up. As soon as objective was gained an effective signal was put up consisting of a hanging parachute flare which remained burning suspended in mid air for a long time. At different stages the old General explained the situation to us with much gesture. We all went over then and examined their guns bombs c. the rifle grenades are fired with ball cartridge. Bugles sounding all the men formed up. As we moved back to our cars
