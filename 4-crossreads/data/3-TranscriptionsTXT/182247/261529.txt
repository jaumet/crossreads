 Rose 6.&nbsp; Could sleep no longer owing to severe bombardment by our guns which shook the dugout and at intervals, caused the sides to crumble and nearly bury us.&nbsp; Did nothing all morning but sleep.&nbsp; Warned for duty in the line in afternoon.&nbsp; Told we were to go to front line that night as road party to mark out the road in the stunt through Polygon Wood, after first wave had gone over, so that supporting troops would know the track to follow.&nbsp; I was made a picket carrier.&nbsp; Did nothing all afternoon except conjure up possibilities as the outcome of to-night&#39;s stunt.&nbsp; Told to fall in at 1.45 am. in morning in battle order.&nbsp; Got things ready for the job.&nbsp; Examined Gas masks.&nbsp; Put diary in overcoat in case anything happened to me and asked Tim Woods, in case I should get pipped, to forward it on to John, which he promised to do.

 The day of days.&nbsp; Rose 1.30 and had tea. Fell in 2.&nbsp; Marched out to front line ready for hop over at day-break.&nbsp; Reached there about 4.&nbsp; Guide took us to wrong sector.&nbsp; Went to find our right place.&nbsp; Did not return.&nbsp; We stayed on.&nbsp; Zero hour arrived.&nbsp; Barrage opened 5.45 am.&nbsp; Infantry moved forward.&nbsp; We did not but awaited instructions from Sergt.
