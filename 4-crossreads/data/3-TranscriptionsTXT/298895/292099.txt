 finishing the journey to Eblingham on foot.  Found things as before but learnt that during my absence the Colonel had given me a very high recommendation for the position of Warrant Officer.  He was called on to recommend three names from this Unit but don't expect anything from it as there must be some others who have been Sgts longer than myself &amp; that carrys a lot of weight.  Then again through being deprived of my crown lowers my position of seniority &amp; if I received such a position now it would be over the heads of several Saturday 11th.   Had a very easy day wrote letters in the morning and had kit inspection during the afternoon.  Have made a start on French again but will probably have to drop it when we start work again. Sunday 12th. Aug.   Church parade in morning, afternoon free.  Had a go at looking up French.
