Dear mater,
I hereby beg to acknowledge receipt of socks pairs two & magazines cartoons one.
Fritz is on the fun, & we, unfortunately, are out of the line having a   rest.  Lord help him when we start.  Note the personal touch in the we.
Don't know whether you are receiving my cables which leave here regularly week by week.  Letters also flow continuously from my labouring pencil.  (You thought I was going to say pen) & no doubt   reams of uninteresting literature are helping to swell the libraries of countless Goanti-Spikes or whatever other monsters inhabit the chasms of the vasty deep.  (That's rather good isn't it?)
Don't worry about me. I'm as safe as the goldest sovereign  in the pocket of the mingiest Hebrew.
Much love, & an equal amount of lingering embraces.
Your adoring filial encumbranceKeith
