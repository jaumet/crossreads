 Tel-el-Kebir or here, &amp; that makes it all the more easy for seeing one another. Caesar too is flourishing &amp; doing good work. Of Evan Richards we have had no news since the official intimation that he had gone to Malta. 
 I am so glad the Battalion committee meeting was such a success. The comforts are tremendously appreciated by us all. I think we have received all the cases that were sent off. At Tel-el-Kebir we were fairly inundated with parcels. Curiously enough the Xmas consignment arrived before the very first shipment of all. The men were delighted. You have no idea how much it all means to them. Out here we are very comfortably off with tents mess &amp; bands. You people have not neglected a single thing that could add to our comfort. I hear from everyside of the excellent work Keith has been doing. How nice for you to have him at home for Xmas. 
 Kindest regards to yourself &amp; the Judge 
 Yours very sincerely
