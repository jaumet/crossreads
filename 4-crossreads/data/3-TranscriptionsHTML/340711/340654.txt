<p>September.<br/>Friday, 1.<br/>Saw doctor in morning. Told me to come next morning. (He wanted to pack me off there and then, but I had my pay book arrangements to make.)</p>
<p>Saturday, 2.<br/>Went over to doctor's---thence Albert, No 13 Clearing Station in cook's cart. Met McCleave there. Thence in motor to Vandencourt, No. 1 Canadian Hospital. Thence motor to Puchvillers (English)---thence train.</p>
<p>Sunday, 3.<br/>Arrived Boulogne abut 3.am. Thence motor to No 8 Stationary Hospital. Wonder of wonders! Caught sight of Australian Flag and found it was No. 2 A.G.H. Sent down note to C. and she came up in afternoon. Had bath and complete change of clothing. Khaki taken away and blue suit issued. Got to bed 6.am. Orderly came 7.am and woke me and told me to get up---spoke roughly. Feeling absolutely knocked up after long journey etc. Gave him something to go on with and in middle of it had seizure.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 5.<br/>Doctor insists on my getting up. I saw my sheet and noticed it diagnosed "Epilepsy?---under observation," Told him point-blank I was not a neurasthenic but had had a bad fall and injured my back. Told him I had been six months in line and not had a day's sickness. Later in day begged the Sister in Charge to get me an X Ray examination if she could.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 6.<br/>X Ray examination. Two plates taken. Photographed through abdomen. German prisoner helped to carry me in. Very considerate and willing.</p>
