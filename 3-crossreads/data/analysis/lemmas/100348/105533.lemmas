 gentleman who show me the way to it . He was a garrul bird veri courteous in his manner but I had to be guard with him for this place teem with spi . 18/2/16 The Battalion is for a new stunt tonight , have to lie in camp dure the next three night , rest on our arm so to speak . Each man has 100 round of ball ammunit , and order to be readi to march off at a moment notic . An old precaut against a "rise " I believ . I hope someth happen to make it worth while for there will be no excurs dure the next three . It is my idea that these coon will never kick against the british rule , they know when they are well off , and have never seen such prosper as they are enjoy now .
