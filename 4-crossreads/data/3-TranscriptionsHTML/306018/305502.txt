<p>March 1918<br/>Stayed for supper &amp; got back to our quarters about &frac12; past 10.</p>
<p>Monday 18th<br/>Had little to do in the morning so wrote a couple of letters, one to Doles.  Saw<br/>  our colonel in the afternoon he has just come back from Australia.  Remained in during the evening.  Had some music in our Recreation Room at the Quarters.</p>
<p>Tuesday 19th<br/>Had a fair bit of work to do, but enjoyed a good sleep in the afternoon.  5 of us got a box at the Opera House, &amp; saw Miss Hook of Holland.  It was really very good &amp; quite witty.</p>
<p>Wednesday 20th<br/>Usual day at the office.  Went round to the Bank in the afternoon.  Still no money.  It is over a month since I cabled.  Went to see the Mummers, a soldier troop who are giving 1 performance here at the Piccadilly.  They are quite worth hearing.</p>
<p>Thursday 21st<br/>Wrote a letter or two as there is not much work coming in now.  Went for a walk in the afternoon.</p>
