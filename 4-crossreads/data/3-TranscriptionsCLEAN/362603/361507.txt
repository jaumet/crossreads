  
 4.  Miss Ninnes being responsible for the face washer.  You must thank them both for me.  I would write to both only that my letters may not be liked.  I have not forgotten the other business yet & never will forget either.  I paid the Boatman on the River last Saturday with the last of my sovereigns.  I have had this last one for such a long time & T'was like parting with an old Friend.  I am getting some money from the Firm & when I get it I will let you know & you can pay the Firm in Sydney  10 for me also for Ellis.  It is much cheaper, no humbug, & quickly done.  I will want some money to go to the Isle of Man this month & I am broke. Well Dad, I have given You such news as there is & I must get on with some of my other letters. Heaps of Love to all at Home & to my old Friends who enquire. Your own Boy Harry
