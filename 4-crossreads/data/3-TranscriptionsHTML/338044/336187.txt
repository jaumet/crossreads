<p>13th July:- Thursday<br/>Out at 6.30 am &amp; as the prickly heat rash is very irritating I see the doctor in hope of getting something to ease it, but he puts me into a dirty room called a hospital &amp; says I must stay here for a few days. My luck, as usual  &amp; Tommy doctor's brains   However, as there is not even a bed in this dungeon, I politely take myself off &amp;  go around the ship at leisure. Rather rough to-day &amp; the sea is very choppy. We have a new Sergeant's mess, which is much better   No submarines or mines so far. Nearly collided with a tramp steamer about 11 pm. Sleep in my usual bunk.</p>
