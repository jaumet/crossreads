<p>here. they have a big search-light moving around the harbour all night. It is a very pretty sight by night, all the boats alight, the town of Aden, &amp; the forts on the different Peaks.</p>
<p>Friday 22nd Jan. 1915.<br/>Finished coaling this evening, have moved outside the heads and expect to move off in the morning, are waiting for the rest of the boats that went to Colombo.</p>
<p>One of the fellows at Aden was telling me that they had rain here the other day for the first time for eleven years. There is a well in Aden supposed to have been put down B.C. &amp; still getting water out of it &amp; some of the reservoirs were built during King Solomon's time.</p>
<p>Saturday 23rd Jan. 1915.<br/>Arrived in the Red Sea early this morning. All boats slacked speed at 12 noon today during the burial of one of the infantry on the Siramic, happened to see his burial, the boat being just in front of us, they just wrap him up in canvas, put lead in, place him on a plank &amp; slide him into the ocean.</p>
<p>We have just passed what they call the 12 Apostles in the Red Sea, it is 12 hills in a line.</p>
<p>Rumoured that there has been a Turkish warship sighted.</p>
