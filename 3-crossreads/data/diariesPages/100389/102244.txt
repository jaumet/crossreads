were on the road. The journey was tedious and at 12.30 we arrived at Warloy where we stayed for the night.
17th Reveille at 4.30 am and by 8 am we were on the way. Progress was as usual very slow. The ground was still slippery though much better than yesterday.
By 12 noon we were at Senlis where we parked up and made bivouacks. During the afternoon it rained and everything was converted into a muck heap.
18th Beautiful day. Harness cleaning & steel burnishing. Gee some work!! All night long a terrific bombardment raged which could be heard quite distinctly here. About 5 am
19th inst it ceased. Rain continued all day and about 9 pm the artillery opened out again.
20th Beautiful day. Harness cleaning & burnishing. Bombardment commenced about 9 pm and kept going solid till about 5 am 21st when it lapsed into one continual rumbling and about 9 am it died down. If we can hear it at this distance it must be hell in the line. Route march from 9 am to 12 noon.
