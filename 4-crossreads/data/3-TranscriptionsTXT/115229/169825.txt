injuries on reaching hospital. We left for reserves at Villa camp on the 9th, where we remained for 4 days prior to going into the line again at Le Sars. We went in this time as company gunners, battalion gunners being cut out. We were in for four days and then came out for a rest for the same length of time. Again we went in on the same sector and on the night of the 24th hopped over and took Le Butt Warlencourt. Here we consolidated and remained until 2 p.m.
