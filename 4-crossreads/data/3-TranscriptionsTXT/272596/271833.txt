A heavy6 wind accompanied by rain sprang up after breakfast this morning & it was no time before I was feeling anything but gay & to make matters worse I had pains in the stomach.  I felt crook the whole day & had no dinner nor tea but laid on my coils of rope right up till 8' oclock tonight when we entered Colombo, there was nothing much to be seen only a row of lights & a lighthouse throwing out warnings.
Was doing a bit more sewing a little while ago & managed to run the needle right through my fore-finger
There is a chance of us not going ashore at Colombo for it appears we have a patient with meningitis aboard, if true we will be kept in isolation for this is an infectious disease  they operated or inoculated him this evening
