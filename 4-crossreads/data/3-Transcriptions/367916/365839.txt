<p>Keith might be able to give some school particulars &ndash;</p>
<p>May 22</p>
<p>My dear Ferguson,<br/>The Hermes made such a rotten mess of the last notice. Page 1 enclosed shows that I sent page 1 + letters &amp; the notice omitted everything of any value &amp; spelt Edinburgh Edinbough. If the notices are [indecipherable] why not get Keith to initial it? It wd. be nice to have an old pal do it.</p>
<p>[indecipherable] for the material with my thanks. Hermes is not yet to hand I will return it in the mail.</p>
<p>[indecipherable]</p>
<p>Can you send me a draft?</p>
