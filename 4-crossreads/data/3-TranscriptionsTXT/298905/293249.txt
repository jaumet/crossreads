trenches for our own, both rifles seem to crack alike out in front, but there is one point which is always worth noting & that is the flares for the squareheads use about 10 to our one & they are a much superior & bigger flare than oursWe had this morning (Sunday) a blanket, gas helmet, & rifle inspection it was only a short affair & we were then dismissed, 2 of my section were sent to hospital this morning, one of the chaps had "the wind up" (an expression for scare) one night & gave a false gas alarm.The boys have a daily routine of our work here, this is their version of it  11 hours "stand to" 12 hours work & 1 hour for meals all the rest of the day you can have off for sleep &etc.There will be a big fatigue party leave here tonight, I am on one of the jobs.
