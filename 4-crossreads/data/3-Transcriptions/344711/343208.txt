<p>them away to work in another part of the island, &amp; bringing them back at night.  In afternoon we had a sudden storm, with the largest hail I have ever seen.</p>
<p>25th<br/>Same as yesterday.  Tired &amp; sick.</p>
<p>26th<br/>Had a day's rest.  Went out in a sailing boat to the flagship of the fleet, H.M.S. Exmouth.  Had a good look round among the guns, etc.  They have a lovely string band on board, and it sounded lovely after the rough time we have had.  Got sea-sick coming back in a naval pinnace, &amp; a soaking in the rain to boot.  Had tea with Jack Pettit in bakehouse.</p>
<p>No work for the Turks to-day as our Friday is their Sunday.</p>
<p>Tried to return to the peninsula, but the M.O. wouldn't let me.</p>
<p>27th<br/>Went out on H.M.S. Bacchante a 4 funnelled warship.</p>
<p>28th<br/>M.O. agreed to let me go back again to-morrow, going first to Mudros for M.E.</p>
