  
 Wednesday 20 Sept. 1916 Everything underfoot was fearfully wet & slushy but there were only a few driving showers during the day. Went round battalions in the morning & in the afternoon stayed inside for Leo's visit. Most crops of hops have now been harvested, also chickory : maize sown in drills 10" apart is abt. 3'6" to 4' high & being used as greenfeed.
