  
 I waited for a while though & managed to get another, intending to change at Andover Junction. I woke at Southampton, and decided to have a holiday so went on to Plymouth, up to Bristol, and then on to Salisbury by Bath. 
 I arrived there about 3 am and had to pay 15/- for a car to Wilton whence I walked to camp. 
 There was a parcel and several letters also for me which I read till the others woke. 
 We left that night for France.
