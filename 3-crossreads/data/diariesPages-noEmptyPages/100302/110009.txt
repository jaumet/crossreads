Erquinghem-Sur-Lys
5/6/16
Awakened at 6 pm by Sergt Major re fatigues and put on gumboots and overcoat and went over to have a look at the men. They had no bed clothes or blankets at all and were lying huddled up in restless cold sleep on their hut floors. There was a great deal of coughing.
Later on in the day all were pleased to see the transports come up bearing our blankets home again.

Inside are tawdry wreaths, tiny china images c and in some cases there is even a photograph of the late lamented.
