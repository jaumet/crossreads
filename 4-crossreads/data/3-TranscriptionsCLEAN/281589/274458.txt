 We were giving the opportunity of voting, but a lot of us didn't as we were fed with tales of the Min party (Nationalists) and heard nothing of the other side of the "House". We marched out at 6.30 PM to go up the line for the Stunt, carried blankets  & stretchers right up to the front line (about 1 miles in front of Novieul) arrived there safely. I went to sleep for a while, Fritz must have taken a tumble, he put a barrage over with gas shells and H.E.s he nearly got me with his gas as I was asleep. He kept it up for about 1/2 hour & about 1/2 hour after that (4 AM) we opened up. the fighting was terrible, we wasn't too successful & suffered heavily.
