<p>[Thursday 7 December 1916]</p>
<p>Here I am 8 miles from <strike>Al Arish</strike> &amp; among the Turks again- Aerial Bombs as of yore &amp; Camel Patrols in touch   Since I left <strike>Sinai</strike> the railway &amp; Pipeline have pushed on a lot &amp; the main road has been laid down with ordinary &frac12; X 17X 42 Rabbit netting, five lengths wide quite good for marching on foot &amp; for Motor Cars<br/>It is expensive but might be used over Sandhills near Homesteads out West.<br/>All ranks seem glad to see me back but the Truck I rode out in was about as rough a train journey as a man could have only sand ballast &amp; always drifting.<br/><strike>I wrote J.A.C [indecipherable] on loss of 2 sons</strike></p>
