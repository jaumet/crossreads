  
 Mon. Mar. 19. The sea is not quite as rough this morning, but the wind is very keen & the ship still rolling a bit. The Hosp. is filling up again; keeping us on the move. A chap named Roberts, from Manly came in last night. "Poss" & I gave him an ananema, which "put the wind up him" somewhat. He is alright this morning. The rumour is that we are  not  going to Hobart from Adelaide, which will be a mighty good job if it's true, as it will bring Sydney a few days nearer. The Food continues good & we manage to satisfy our patients; which is a big item. We have 8 malaria Patients in now, all "Gentleman of the Light Horse". They are a very decent crowd. Tues. Mar. [indecipherable] They say now that we are going to Hobart, but I'm hang if I know what to believe.
