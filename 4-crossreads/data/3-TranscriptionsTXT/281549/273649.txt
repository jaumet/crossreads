 Sunday the 7th of October  I again moved, this time to the village called Zeven at a distance of about 100 kilometres. At 7 am we left Gnarrenburg Station changed trains at Bremennorde Junction &amp; thence to Zeven arriving at about 12 noon. 
 We are sleeping on the top floor of the Farmer's premises &amp;  have  two big rooms between seven of us, It is the most comfortable place I have been in so far, The food is also very good, too good to last. The work that we are to do is Potato digging. We worked at the Potato digging job from the 8th till the 13th, when we were sent away for not doing the work properly.
