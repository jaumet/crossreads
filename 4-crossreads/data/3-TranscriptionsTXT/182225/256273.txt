1916   SUNDAY 4   JUNE
Another beautiful day. We turned out for Church parade at eight oclock and after fooling round for a couple of hours we marched through the town about 13/4 miles to the town hall and had service in the hall  After service we were dissmissed till 10.30 pm  The same lot of us had dinner at Butterworths and then went out in a car to a sugar refinary & went all over it. It was very interesting. Went to the Zoo afterwards & had tea & a look round the animals  Saw a dingo, kangaroos emus jackasses ect & thought we were home for a bit. Drove round the beach & then up to Butterworths for tea
