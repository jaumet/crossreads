<p>the loss of dear old Les. It seems so awful that I can hardly realise he is gone &ndash; It is one of the times when we wonder if its all worth it, as these things happen. We all realise that if our time comes while on service we are going out in the best cause but it makes it no easier to bear when a comrade is taken &ndash; I cannot tell you anything more than the enclosed letter written me by our Chaplain, Capt Stevenson, who met Les on several occasions, - He refers to one instance of their meeting which was when we played football against them &ndash; A finer or straighter man than Les never lived, of that I am certain &ndash;</p>
<p>The operations just concluded have been very successful, but we had to put in a very hard week of it &ndash; we opened the bombardment at dawn on the morning of the 7th, and about 4 hours afterward</p>
