20 FRIDAY
Fine & Sunny. Cleaning harness
all day, & as it got very rusty
it took some polishing again
We turned our horses out in
a paddock to graze, & my
word they did enjoy themselves
I got three letters & a parcel
from Linda & two from Jo &
some snaps. I camped
in a room in a farm
house. The first time to sleep
between sheets for months.
