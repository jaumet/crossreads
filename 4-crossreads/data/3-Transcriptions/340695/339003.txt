<p>23-8-17. Moved from DRANOUTRE to T20. C.44 (Sheet 28) near NEUVE EGLISE by motor lorry. Are billeted in a Nissen Bord hut in pretty surroundings. Have already had a feed of blue plumes.<br/>28-8-17 Great excitement to-day ending in a very narrow escape for me. A huge tree was blown right across the hut I was in smashing it to matchwood but I rose through the debris unscathed. I was the only occupant at the time had the adjutant been there he would certainly have been killed. Our papers &amp; gear were scattered some &amp; it took a couple of hours to clear everything but now we are again safely installed in another hut. It was the closest shave I have yet had.</p>
