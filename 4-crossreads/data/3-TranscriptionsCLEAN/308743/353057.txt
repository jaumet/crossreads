Slept out last night on account of the heat & during another night horse pegged out & was dumped this morning.  Vaccination was proved a failure by doctor's verdict this morning.  Officers practicing for tomorrow's night concert.  News came to hand that Turkey apologized to Great Britain but she was calmly told that the time for apologies was past & now has to fight.  A burial took place on board the NZ fleet the chap who had appendicitis died, got orders concerning appearance of enemy by closing all port holes etc & heard tonight that Germans are hovering around.  Canteen run out of soft stuff & now have to die of thirst.  We are to be inoculated next week so another bad time in store.  Had all the afternoon off & occupied my time by playing chess & having a general clean up.   Entered [indecipherable] at 9 AM.  Changed our course at 7 PM tonight goodnight at 9
