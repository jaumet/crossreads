Landed Anzac 1915
92 wks of soldiering
Reveille as usual
Twelve months today since we landed in Gallipoli, hope it wont be long before we go into action again, at 2.30 today we were sneaking round Shrapnel gully like rabbits, carrying panniers. Horses went out as usual to the palms men played quoits. The advance guard of the Dorset yeomantry put in their appearance, the shelters are to be gone on with straight away our old camp site has been condemned. Work has been very heavy we cleared 100 outgoing messages during the day piles of DRLS stuff coming going all ways.
Played cricket after tea wrote letters met the train at 10.30 after that turned in at well nigh eleven.
Mail arrived but nothing for me.
