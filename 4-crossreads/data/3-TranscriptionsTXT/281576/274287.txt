 Bed 54 FRI. Oct. 5.  Last night I put on my Blighty clothes &amp; sat up in Bed till about 2 a.m.  I heard the motors buzzing around, &amp; thought, "Oh, they'll be here for me presently".

Our chaps continue to give Fritz Hell, which is certainly good news.  And they are holding all the ground they took.  --  About 1.30 a.m. on

Here I was put in a Bunk.  The Train was staffed by V.A.D's, &amp; they looked after us well.  The Train left about 4.30,  They
