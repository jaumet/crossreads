<p>very interesting &ndash; this my first glimpse of Italy.  I had to take things fairly quietly as was still feeling a bit groggy.<br/>The train arrived at Milan (150 kiloms.), my next "port of call" at 7 p.m. and I put up at the Hotel Cavour, via Alessandro Manzoni close to the Public Gardens.  After a good dinner I made tracks for the Teatro Lyrico, crossing the Piazza Duomo and getting a first glimpse of the magnificent Cathedral.  At the theatre I secured a good seat and saw "Cavalleria Rusticana" followed by a splendid ballet (storica allegorica fantastica) "Excelsior" which lasted fully an hour and a half with constantly changing scenes and magnificent costumes.<br/>The following morning I went first through the Cathedral and down into the crypt, and then visited the world famed Scala Opera</p>
