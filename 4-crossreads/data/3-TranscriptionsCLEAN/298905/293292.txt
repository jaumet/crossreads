After it was over a patrol of ours went across to the German trenches & there was not a living soul left nothing but a mass of dead & mutilated men, I believe it was something awful in the trenches, the patrol penetrated to their second line & it was nearly the same there, they brought one prisoner  went  back with them & strange to say he had a pass on him made out for Berlin, how stiff was he, though I suppose he can count himself one of the lucky one's, the power & fierceness of our bombardment was indescribable, Lone Pine," was only a flea bite
