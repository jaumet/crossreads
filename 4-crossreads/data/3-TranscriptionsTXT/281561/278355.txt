4/1/17. The cold, wet weather continues so work in the tunnel, out of the rain is very acceptable. Fritz is suspicious of our mine shafts and tries to plunk a shell down them occasionally. He put a shell into the back of my little wet home where I sleep with Sheperd, last night. Fortunately it was a "dud."5/1/17.Was sent to mend the duck board track known as "Cavalry Track". The Bosche was in a peevish humour and peppered us with shrapnel. We had just completed repairing it; when he destroyed a chain of it with three well placed shells. He uses the high velocity shrapel shell here we know as "Yellow Jack!" or "Yellow Peril!" Beastly climate. Paid 20 Franc's.
