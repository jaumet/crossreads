In accordance with our appointment with the Belge, take the train to Bonsecours at 3 p.m., but after waiting for half an hour & he had not arrived, we came to the conclusion that he must have been despatched on duty & make off.  As usual I start buying some souvenirs which may be overdone, as spend my money.  A cup of tea & some cakes at our usual cafe & return.  A walk around the town until 8-30 p.m. &
