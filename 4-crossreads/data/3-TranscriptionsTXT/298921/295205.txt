August, 1915Sunday 22I have tried to keep going in a normal way & forget the scenes & mates I have lost - It would not do to brood there is much to be done yet.I can hear Church being held -This is funny Wm Gunners son from Walgett sent an admission card to my old camp for me to come & see him, he is in the 6 L.H. wounded & in next corridor but did not know I also was wounded & in the same Hospital.
