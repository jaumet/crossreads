  
 April 1917 22nd continued   & in one part a once "No-mans-land," there is an enormous crater or rather succession of craters blown up by our mines at the beginning of the advance, one being about 90' deep the others ranging between 60' & 80' deep. The German's position there was exceedingly strong & the hill is almost undermined by "deep dugouts," most of which have now been destroyed. The Sergeants mess has been formed here in the camp & the Cpl & Sgt are sleeping in it.   The remainder of the section are in a large "bow" hut & I am in charge.
