<p>Mena Camp.<br/>3rd January 1915.</p>
<p><strike>Another</strike> The New Year has come along and we are still here but suppose we will have about another two months training and then off to France perhaps- who knows?<br/>George and I have now got a black friend he is not black really, he is brown, an Bedouin Arab and a vendor of antiquities, today he took us to his home and gave us coffee and cake and afterwards presented us with a charm &ndash; the eye of Horus- which will guard us from all evil spirits and bring us safe through the War.  Of course we believed all this for the afternoon as it wouldn't been at all nice to doubt a man in his own house would it?  His name is Hessien</p>
