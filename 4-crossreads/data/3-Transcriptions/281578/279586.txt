<p>the 13th Bn. Heavy rain again today, the weather is very unsettled lately.<br/>24 July Had some shooting today, had a devil of a walk as usual to get there, hot &amp; muggy, &amp; mud underfoot. Only fired at small targets at 25 yards; first we had a grouping practice with gas masks on, then rapid fire for a minute with masks on, then for a minute without mask with fixed bayonet, &amp; then a snapshooting practice. In the afternoon, I played cricket with the 13th Bn against the Honorable Artillery Company (Tommies) on their ground. We finished at 8 p.m. then there was the long trip back, so a chap is about knocked up. The Tommies won by 30 runs, they had a good batting team, one chap had played with Somerset, &amp; one with Yorkshire seconds. They gave us tea, the usual army issue plus boiled eggs, very decent of them. I got a ride back to La Houssoye on a motor lorry, &amp; it was raining heavily as I walked on to our dugouts, the ground was very slippery. Thursday 25 July<br/>Reveille at 6, didn't I wish I could have slept on. We are supposed to be having an easy time, but with the distance from Querrieu we are always tramping, &amp; cricket till 8, &amp; the trip back to our company afterwards, a man is always tired. Today we had a gas</p>
