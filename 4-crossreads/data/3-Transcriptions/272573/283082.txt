<p>for  a stroll. Went again through the woods to St Etienne. After having a cup of coffee, we went out of bounds, into the city. Feeling that we had to go very warily on this account not having a pass, we avoided the M.P.s as much as possible.</p>
<p>After having a look round we boarded a tram to get back to camp but it was so overcrowded that we decided to get off again.</p>
<p>We tried to hire a taxi. This was a fruitless search. Luckily an officer seeing our difficulty offered to give us a lift in his taxi which we readily accepted. We drove rapidly back to camp and arrived there a few minutes before "Lights Out".</p>
<p>April 20th. Thurs.<br/>Wrote a few letters in the Y.M. Hut. Went to the Hospital Concert this evening. Very slow and did not wait long.</p>
<p>April 22nd. Sat.<br/>Very wet weather these last few days. C, D and myself were entertained to tea by Mr Purvis. Had a very interesting talk with him.</p>
<p>Went to a Lecture later.</p>
<p>In the concert hall things were very amusing. A prize of a few cigarettes were given to the men who would sing a song first. No one seemed to take the bait until after a good deal of hesitation a youngster plucked up courage, mounted the platform and broke down in the middle of the song. This caused a great deal of amusement, especially so when Mr Purvis presented him with a box of cigarettes. This set the ball arolling and quite a number sang songs without the motive power of prize winning and quite a pleasant evening</p>
