<p>the <u>Court</u> are living there at present. We did not see any of them. <br/>It is an awfully interesting place &amp; most beautifully situated. We went up the Curfew Tower, into St George's Chapel, where we had 30 mins service, &amp; was most impressive. We sat in the high seats with the Coat of Arms on the top, my, these ancient buildings are wonderful. The most beautiful monument erected to Princess Charlotte by Queen Victoria is in that Chapel. I shall never forget it as long as I live. I've sent a picture  of it. Then we were allowed a peep in at Prince Alberts Chapel &ndash; It is really past all adjectives &ndash; the ceiling alone is worth seeing &amp; we were very sorry at not being allowed inside.<br/>We did not have time to do Eton &ndash; just drove past it, walked along the Thames, saw all kinds of old historical houses etc, but have no time to write about. Had a lovely tea at the prettiest home made cakes etc at a tea room. Also bought some cakes</p>
