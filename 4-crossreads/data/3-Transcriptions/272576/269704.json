<p>10th Sept 1916<br/>Sunday today. Mess orderly. Better lot than the Winchester one. Day slightly cold &amp; dull. Received first letter from Laurie. Walked to Amesbury &amp; then had a look round rotten hole. Got home at 9 oclock.</p>
<p>11th Sept 1916<br/>Day out on manoeuvres. Part allotment of positions. I have got nil so far. Played soccer match against 26th. Result 2 to nil against us. Did not go anywhere.</p>
<p>12th Sept 1916<br/>Started with our own HQrs in morning. Then some more military stunts. All put together signallers from Div. HQrs and Batteries. Makes one sick &amp; tired of the whole show. Anyhow I can see waste time &amp; trouble for nothing. I suppose the Winchester training going to Hell now.<br/>Gen Sir John French visited this camp today. Received first letter from my father &amp; sister since arriving in England. Answered their letters also Lauries &amp;Wyns.</p>
<p>13th Sept 1916<br/>Early morning jerk on hill. Went up &amp; had a good close glimpse at aeroplane on the ground. Signalling test morning. Signalling reading afternoon. Marched with the 7th down to camp 14 to hear lecture from some old [indecipherable] in the Salvation Army a colonel I think. Gave us a [indecipherable]. While we were lined up ready to be marched over an aviator in a small plane gave us a bonser exhibition of flying. Very exciting.</p>
<p>14th Sept 1916<br/>Signalling &amp; out on Battery work. Walked down to camp 10 to find Perce. He was out at Amesbury on Picquet.</p>
