<p>whole process explained &amp; later sampling the finished project. Did not buy any, the prices being excessive. Next caught a tram to Le Bar walking on to Gorge du loup, a lovely spot with waterfall etc &amp; fine restaurants. There we had dinner a splendid spread with local wines which are renowned. We were seated on a balcony overlooking a stream &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed it. After, I visited a shop to purchase some postcards &amp; had a great yarn with the proprietor, a horticulturist &amp; collector of stamps, who became very friendly on my giving him some Australian stamps. He gave me some extra postcards, also a bulb of some famous lilly which he had grown. Had tea here &amp; caught the train back at 6 and reached Nice about 8.30 P.M. Did the town for a time &amp; turned in at midnight.<br/>11th Nov. Monday<br/> Decided to do Monte Carlo again so caught the 7 oclock train &amp;</p>
