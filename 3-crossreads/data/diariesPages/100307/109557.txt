The carriages were very warm and the stops en route so tiresome that in common with most of the other passengers went to sleep a couple of times. Leaving Invalides walked past the Chamber of Deputies and over a windy bridge. Have not yet seen the whole 7 bridges at once owing to bad lights. The square of the Concorde was full of dirty snow and the mademoiselles ventured across the road with much trepidation and, at times, squealing. Passed up past Maximes (its chief claim to a place in the sun seems to be in its high prices) and had lunch not far from the Madeline. A bottle of a fish a large steak with a following of tart cost 7 fr. 10. Caught many odd and ends of conversation ? a group next door was driving a hard bargain and concluding some deal.
