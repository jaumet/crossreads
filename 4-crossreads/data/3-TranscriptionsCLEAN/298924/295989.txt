Tuesday 7 January 1919Beautiful weather now, but all ranks are chafing at the delay in getting away, no fresh rumours.Please order for me to await arrival from Peapes, Sydney, a suit of mufti - chose Homespun Australian Tweed of grey material - tell them to hold till I arrive to try on as there will be a rush for civil clothes.  They have my measure & beyond the Tummy might have altered I am little different.
