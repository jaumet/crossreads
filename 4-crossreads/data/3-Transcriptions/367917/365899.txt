<p>Dear Judge Ferguson</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary Gilmore passed along your letter in reply to one of her own, a request, I believe that I shall be given the opportunity of doing <strike>war</strike> pictures in connection with the [indecipherable] war. Mrs. Gilmore has been most persistant and has worked very hard to this end and it seems as if her labour shall bear fruit. Accept my sincere thanks for the help you have given in this matter.</p>
<p>I am overjoyed in the thought that I may be given the opportunity of doing my Country a service, whether it be with the rifle or brush I am satisfied to abide by the decision of those most capable of judgment, all that I wish for is that they shall take of the best that I have to offer &ndash; it is no more or less than the [indecipherable] offering [indecipherable] &amp; my regret is that I have not had an opportunity of offering sooner.</p>
<p>I will write, as you request, and let you know when I am likely to leave.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>E [indecipherable]</p>
