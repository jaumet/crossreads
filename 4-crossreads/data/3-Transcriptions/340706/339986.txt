<p>32<br/>Moderne upstairs &amp; I am whizzed off to their camp at Le Sart, but which they call Brencq. Here the major produces a bottle &amp; cigars &amp; gives me the palliasse off his bed &amp; unlimited number of overcoats I doss quite comfortably for the night</p>
<p>8 January 1919<br/>This morning I only wake at 9 am &amp; decide to miss the train at 10.30 &amp; so have breakfast in bed &amp; then have a warm bath with which this private house is fitted, shave &amp; set out for Lille. I had hardly gone very far when the Major overtook me in his car &amp; I got a lift into Lille.</p>
<p>On way in we pass an anchored balloon round which 5 aeroplanes are circling &amp; passed some Algerian troops leading spare horses. Also some french cavalry with spare horses. Their seats are not good &amp; they ride badly.</p>
<p>I then take tram for Roubaix. Each section costs 5 centimes. The tram ticket is marked on top with the hours &amp; on bottom with days of week (letters only). We pass du Romarin, St Mur, Le Buisson (it is not visible) Croise Laroche, Wasquehal, Le Sart, Velodrome, Pere Barbieux, Roubaix where I get out. Nearby is Tourcoing, Leers &amp; Hem but so far the tram has not commenced to run to these localities</p>
