My Dear Ones,
   Well, here's another Sunday upon us, and again I am sitting in the hut enjoying a rather one-sided conversation with my own folks.  The tourist has had duties this week-end and cannot describe any new scenes visited or any castles at which he's called, instead, yesterday afternoon was spent in a visit to another camp and seeing some Albert Park people.
   After seeing to the start of a "hare and hounds" race at 2-30 I commenced a very pretty and interesting walk along the downs and through the Avon Valley to Bulford Camp, this is a permanent camp very large and well built and there I found Capt.Comber in the married officer's quarters, very comfy and nice.
   Today the clerk brought me my certificate from the Lewis Gun school.  My pass is "First Class Distinguished" so I'm the proud possessor of a "D"  which is much better than I hoped for I was quite new to the gun; but I worked at it really hard and the result is "Distinguished" more than some who were quite expert to start with.  I'll post my certificiate home after I've swanked it in front of the Colonel and one or two others.
   Our brigade is now doing a very strenuous time for twelve days, training all the men in specialist work, bombing, sniping, bayonet fighting, gas defence, and Lewis Gun
