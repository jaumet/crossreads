<p>to England Staff Sgt Williams in charge<br/>Monday Sept 24<br/>Very hot to day. Flies very bad. Usual daily routine<br/>Tuesday Sept 25<br/>Went to Canunis a village some 3 miles from camp. Usual dirty native village with its mud houses built any how &amp; the roofs used to throw rubbish on.<br/>Wed Sept 26<br/>Four days bombardment in progress. Giving Jacko a rough spin. Rumoured big offensive coming off shortly. As many troops as can be spared from the line are resting.<br/>Thursday Sept 27<br/>Donkeys arrived on desert from Cairo. Very funny trying to take them to water. They are to be used by Batmen &amp; grooms owing to shortage</p>
