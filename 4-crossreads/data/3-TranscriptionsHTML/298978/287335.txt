<p>colour. In the evening to Cairo to my favourite rendezvous, the Caf&eacute; Saulte. I like to go here because there are no soldiers. It is such a treat to be among civilised people; it is not their delightful pastry that appeals to me so much as the elegant china, gold and white in Louis Seize style, also a delightful little orchestra which usually plays one of my favourite operas, "La Boheme."</p>
<p>Whenever I enter this place I am much stared at &ndash; why I should receive attention more than other soldiers puzzles me, I used to think it was my egoism made me thinks so, but on several occasions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have drawn my attention to the interest I appear to create.<br/>Often the habitu&eacute;s of the Caf&eacute; make my acquaintance &ndash; I am glad I can speak French, it has been most useful to me in Cairo.</p>
<p>Feb: 24<br/>More wearisome flag wagging.</p>
<p>Feb: 25<br/>Manoeuvres &ndash; this means trouncing across the desert.</p>
<p>Feb: 26<br/>Manoeuvres.   Tonight I dined at the Hotel Heliopolis with my friend Frank Fraser, quite one of the most charming men it has ever been my pleasure to meet.  At first we had some difficulty in getting the maitre d'hotel to permit us to dine here, for we are only privates and this place is the rendezvous of officers.  To be sitting here, surrounded by women charmingly gowned, roses on the tables matching well with the womens' robes, the soft electric light, was ecstasy</p>
