<p>Sunday 23<br/>Mr. Winkler never cut a better figure on the ice than I did to-day on a pond. Nearly came several croppers but never mind. Beautiful weather</p>
<p>Monday 24<br/>"B" Section's dinner last night was a complete success for Xmas.</p>
<p>Tuesday 25<br/>2 pm. Snowing to-day &amp; typically English. I have just seen the patients dinner dished out &amp; everything turned out well. Patients all well pleased. Our meal tonight.<br/>The Dinner was O.K. but no one felt inclined for the concert after. The officers were in a snow fight for us &amp; were rolled over &amp; over in it. Some Xmas.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26<br/>Still more snow, heavy. Not over the effects of last night yet.<br/>Yesterday, hardly a shot was heard &amp; everything was peaceful, with the snow all over the ground.<br/>Heavy bombardment tonight German I think</p>
<p>Thursday 27<br/>Snow still on the ground.<br/>Walk to Caestre to-day.<br/>A Section Bearers is up the line for raid. Roads very slippery &amp; many wagons motor &amp; horse have been ditched as a result.</p>
<p>Friday 28<br/>A visit from Fritz by aeroplane this morning and a couple of bombs dropped near by.<br/>The Kookaburras are here again &amp; the girl is better than ever</p>
<p>Saturday 29<br/>Snow still covers the ground.</p>
