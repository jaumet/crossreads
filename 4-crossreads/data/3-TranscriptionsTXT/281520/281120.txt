Paris4/3/17Being tired rested until about 7 pm and read the papers, then set our for the Place d'Opera going via the dark Place de Vendome.  The streets were fairly quiet except round the Opera where Aida was being performed and many taxis were drawing up.  Lights appear to be permitted just the same as in times of peace.  Refusing services of guides wandered along Boulevard d'Italiens and other streets looking for a restaurant.  The former were all closed.  There are many newspaper kiosks in the streets and the interior of them is illuminated which throws into relief the advertisements on their glass sides.  Had some diner in a place near the Opera.  Soup roast beef and a piece of tart cost 11 fcs.  carving done by a special man who cuts very thin but covers the plate as if helping one lavishly.
In the streets there were crowds passing and many couples intent only on themselves, kissing each other unrestrainedly as they walked along.  In the heaven of bliss, - Some good providence seemed to guard their footsteps from tripping for they had no eyes for their path.  Soldiers everywhere.  Taxis and chara-bancs busses tearing round like juggernauts, Gendarmes in caps capes &amp; slacks walk slowly up &amp; down.  Returned to hotel &amp; needed no rocking to sleep being dog tired
