<p>Well dear just a little about myself &amp; habits. I am in a Company with 5 other officers all good fellows &amp; old hands. 3 of us were in old "G" Coy together "years ago": our O.C. is a Major Rowlands from Manly. We are a very happy family mess together always. I am mess secretary &amp; have to keep up a good table, one thing about fighting in France we have lots of big canteens where one can buy anything so at a cost of about 20/- a week we live very well.<br/>They are giving us leave now, a very small percentage though, one of our family is away now &amp; when he returns another goes, we get 10 days.</p>
