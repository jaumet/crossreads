June 3/28The next day 3 June - education classes started.  I saw that the classes held possibilities of dodging "fatigue", so pulled on Motor Engineering.  To my regret however, we still had to do fatigue until our Sgt instructor made a fuss & got us exempt.  The classes were very interesting & I picked up a fair amount of theoretical information regarding motor engines & magnetos.  The troops generally were becoming very fed up.  Different stories were started every day about our sailing date.  Nearly everyone was short of cash, & our only amusement was to walk along the promenade, & go to our "buckshee" picture show.  The latest "furphy" was that we were to go on the Port Melbourne on July 2nd.
