<p>are mostly legal men a fine lot of fellows.</p>
<p>Money is running very low &amp; I am going without one meal a day &amp; taking no amusements till I know where I stand. I wish I had some account on which I could draw. I have &pound;15 on me due to my account at London but I am frightened to spend a penny till I know when my next pay will be forwarded. How I shall last till November I have not the slightest idea but I mean to stay here all the same even if I have no meals &amp; no bed.</p>
<p>All the organisations &amp; clubs are closing &amp; there is no recourse. Even the Americans are closing down in July I am continuing the American course until its conclusion &amp; then I shall have to take a tutor whose fees will be 10 fr per hour. The University people give me a lot of address at which I can find board &amp; lodging ranging from 80 fr to 300 fr.</p>
<p>11-6-19<br/>I spend all the morning looking for rooms &amp; visiting the addresses which have been given to me. Most of the rooms will not be free until the student vacant in some cases 15 day in other a month &amp; finally take rooms temporarily in Hotel des Grand Hommes in Place de la Pantheon at 70 fr</p>
