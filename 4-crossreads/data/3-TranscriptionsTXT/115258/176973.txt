My dear Mother
Its Saturday evening - time about half past nine and I'm on the phone sitting in a bell tent which was camouflaged with bamboos and other green stuff a couple of days ago, and its just beginning to dry and the smell of it carries me back to the Cooyal lucerne flats, and I remember the evenings you and Father and I have driven past there with Joe in the old sulky and smelt the new own hay, on our way home after a day in Mudgee. And Now you tare past there in a car and I'll bet you go so fast you hardly see those flats - let alone smell them. But I guess the car will do me and I wont stop to smell smells or be poetical once I get going.
