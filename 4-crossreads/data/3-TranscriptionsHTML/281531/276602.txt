<p>10/8/18<br/>Framerville<br/>were lying around direlict. The place was only captured yesterday afternoon. Near the church were a number of stinking horses killed by our armoured cars and a visit to the house adjoining gave us a rich harvest of souvenirs. In the backyard was a travelling library full of cheap novels &amp; inside the house a meal was in preparation in the kitchen meat chopped up and wine poured out. Clothing &amp; personal belongings everywhere. One room was a shop full of books, some of them really valuable. We ratted the place and got out with our loot just as he let out a bombardment. One shell went close enough. Had a hot walk back to Harbonieres [Harbonnieres] where we picked up our horses. Rode back to Camp. After lunch</p>
