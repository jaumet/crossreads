<p>My dear Father,</p>
<p>The mail has just arrived &amp; is being distributed now. I've already got several letters including one each from you, Mother, Grandmother &amp; Mr Breilly. I'm answering them in a sort of a way right now, while I am in the wood. Among the parcels so far to hand, are two waterproof sheets which will undoubtedly prove invaluable. I can't find anything of interest to write about, for the reason that, no matter what happens, at any time, we all regard it as a natural course of events &amp; not likely to be of any interest to anyone.</p>
<p>How we got away from the Peninsula is as great a mystery to me as to anyone. That the Turks knew what we were at, there can be no doubt, &amp; I feel certain myself that we were leaving it too late. For the last three or four nights we expected an attack, which if delivered with any vigour would have meant the end of the very thin line that was then left. What made us particularly anxious was the fact that the Turks tested our line with a few men every night during the last week. They did not drive home the attack till &ndash; some say twelve hours, others thirty six hours after we had left. Very little was left behind. I left nothing.</p>
<p>Love to all</p>
<p>Your affectionate son</p>
<p>Arthur.</p>
