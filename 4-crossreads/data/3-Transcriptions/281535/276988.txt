<p>3/6/19<br />London<br />Road and did other errands all the afternoon. The business people seem to be a gang of robbers and cheerfully ask the most exorbitant prices. Went out by tube to Elliot &amp; Fry&#39;s at Baker Street and had my photograph taken. Dined at hotel and then went out to Hammersmith and saw La Tosca well done.</p>
<p>4/6/19<br />Did much tearing about London until 11 a.m. looking in at St. Pauls where scaffolding was still erected and work going on in the interior. This seems to be a semi perpetual job as every time I have been in since 1916 the chisels have been busily sounding. Left London at 12.15 in rain and reached Warminster at about 3.15. Settled down in camp very soon and had a yarn with Colonel James. News of Grand Parade winning Derby at 23-1.</p>
