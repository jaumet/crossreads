8/12/18 Paris he swung along. From here we took tube to Abesses and walked up through picturesque slums of Montmartre to the Eglise Sacre Coeur which crowns the height. The day was slightly foggy so the view was spoiled. Inside the big church is by no means bare and many hundreds of candles were burning. Now returned to tube & so to Opera. Walked to Arrigonis where we lunched well and then by metro to Cite. Had a look at the Conciergerie and then to Notre Dame which lighted up looked better than ever before. A bishop in crozier mitre and golden vestments was conducting a ceremony. To  St Julien Les Pauvres and St Severin. At the latter there were crowds of nuns and novices and a cleric was delivering an eloquent sermon. We then walked down Boul Mich and tubed back to Opera
