<p>Dear old mater,</p>
<p>What do you think of this scrawl for a young beginner?  Dont think it hurts because it does not, but its the best I can do for the present.</p>
<p>It was on <strike></strike> the 31st March that it happened and I think Fritzy might have been more <strike></strike> careful.  The first was alright, a bullet through the fleshy part of the right arm above the elbow; but throwing bits of shrapnel at a man's head was a bit too <strike></strike> strong I thought.  It landed on the left side and glanced off &ndash; a good job it was the head.</p>
<p>I <strike></strike> swore for a <strike></strike> while <strike></strike> but after about 5 mins. gradually lost the power of speech.  I can't speak</p>
