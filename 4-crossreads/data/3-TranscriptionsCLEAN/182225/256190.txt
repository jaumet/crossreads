 FEB.   FRIDAY 4   1916 
 Fine & hot again. I was detailed off among others of 15/1 to get the horse lines ready as 60 horses were coming to camp. We got fixed up & away by 3 pm. The 15/1 was on duty & I got main guard  I was on guard at the gun park again. It was hard luck the 15/1 striking duty as I could not get in to Linda for two nights. The horses arrived about 6.15 pm  They are not a bad lot, but too light for artillary horses.
