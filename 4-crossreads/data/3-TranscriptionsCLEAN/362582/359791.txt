  
 as escorts - We had quite an exciting afternoon, met Fred's Regiment moving out. So you can imagine my joy at seeing the boys again & knowing they were alright. George looked very brown but well & they were all so dirty. Fred was also surprised to see me - I met ever so many more friends along the line and poor old chaps, all looked so tired & dirty - they had been a good number of days on the march. We could not get to the Canal, but stayed & talked to all the boys. I received a little letter from poor old Norman but of course he could not tell me where they are, but old address would find him. He was well & enjoyed the cigarettes I sent him. Tell Alice Bower I wrote to her last week. Hope you get all my letters. I'm awfully disappointed at not receiving my Aust. mail to-day - none since last Thursday - week, so am longing for them.
