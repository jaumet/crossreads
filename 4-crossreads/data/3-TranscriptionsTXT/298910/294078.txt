Bapaume ere this.
Saturday 28/10/16
Drizzling rain & blowing a treat - relieved at 5.30 pm. Had a fairly easy day. Heavy Bombardment night & day - Fritz sending over plenty of H.E. Shrapnel. Had a fairly good sleep after a good nip of rum back at our dump 5 miles back. Going home in the dark. Capt Elliott, Capt Medcalf got bogged to the knees - Sergt Stevenson in trying to help got bogged worse than either. I went away & got a spade - dug Stevenson out first, then Elliott, we got Capt Medcalf out minus his boots, he had to walk home barefooted - I couldn't help laughing & said didn't "Bairnsfather" hit it nicely - Bairnsfather he said, what time do they feed the Sea lions. I think surely there must be a special place place in either Heaven or hell for us Volunteers - I haven't struck a man yet who didn't ease his mind by curses  when he fell about 6 ft into a shell hole. Actually got letters from Annie - Jess Hagan & L. Single, all of whom say they haven't received any news of me for 3 months, this is very consoling to a bloke doing a perish here.
