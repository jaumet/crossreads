 8 January, Wednesday 
 F Go down Town to see Dick Whittington & His Cat with Ellis & S/S Lilley. It is very long up to 11.15 pm. Very good in parts. I meet Natt, Roy's Brother. He, with whom I was nearly drowned. There is lots of sentimental rubbish shewn & I am very scornful of it all. We have to walk all way Home via steps route.
