<p>14.3.16<br/>I had a long day in exercising the horses &amp; was in the saddle most of the day.  Just as I was about to unsaddle the Postman ran up to me &amp; gave me a gloriously long letter from Nina, you can bet I was very pleased with same.<br/>I am teaching my horse to follow me &amp; even now he will walk about all over the place after me.  I run away from him &amp; he will come trotting after me.<br/>I rode through Helmieh to-day, where the Howitzer Camel Corps is camped &amp; am gradually getting him used to them.  I also went through Zeitoun &amp; Matarieh.  Apart from the usual Transport nothing much occurred..</p>
<p>15.3.16 Wednesday<br/>Had a good days work on convoying Fodder to Nebu Pasha Barracks.  I also went down to the Irrigation of the Lower Nile &amp; the scenery is very nice.<br/>Equipment for the Train is now pouring in &amp; it looks as though we wont be long before we are fit for the Road.</p>
