29/8/15 Up at 5. Big church parade stayed in lines and issued orders. March past At 9 all kits stacked near road and motor lorries turned up. The motor service most efficient from one end of the road to the other one long line of lorries close behind one another, getting away when loaded and then another coming in. No bustle no confusion just shows what motor transport can do. A memorable sight. All hands slept on ground and slept like tops breeches the best pillow. The only trouble is feet which will persist in sticking out. Australian mail just arrived in time to catch us before leaving. Trains go at 9 pm. 2.30 am so all night we'll be travelling. Our transport is H.T. Scotian, our complement about 1300 military. Our own battalion all together fortunately not split between 2 boats like some of the other regiments. We also carry the 6th Field Ambulance
