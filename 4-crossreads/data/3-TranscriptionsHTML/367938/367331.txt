<p>see any Majors &ndash; after a minute or two he came out &amp; said "the Col. is at mess &amp; I don't like to disturb him. I said "I don't want to disturb him at mess but don't want to wait outside your hospital." He then gave me a stool &amp; a paper. After &frac12; an hour they were discussing the "bloke waiting for the Col" &amp; I got sick of it &amp; said I didn't want to see the Col. at all but simply to get into their hospital.</p>
<p>The Sergt. argued I did want to see the Col. &amp; I showed him the paper the Cpl gave him that I was a patient &ndash; he said he didn't look at <u>that</u> &amp; why didn't I say. After telling him it was his business to admit patients &amp; give them a bed if there was one, I was sent to D Ward &ndash; a tent with 2 or 3 officers &amp; some 30 soldiers in various stages. That was 6.30 p.m. It was 10 to 10 before they'd been able to cut up some grub &amp; I got some bread again &ndash; starved!</p>
<p>The patient next to me was an awfully nice fellow &ndash; at Lt. in the Innis Killing Fusiliers. He had been bombed through the back at Hellas &amp; usually coughed up blood when he spoke to me for there was a bullet rolling about in his lungs. <u>They were actually feeding him on the same rations as the men in the field</u>. <u>Breakfast</u> &ndash; porridge, boiled egg &ndash; bread &ndash; tea. <u>Dinner</u> stewed meat or tinned meat &ndash; tea. <u>Tea</u> bread, jam &amp; tea.</p>
<p>One of his arms was bound up useless, &amp; in the morning they gave him a <u>soft</u> boiled egg in 1 hand &amp; two chunks of bread in the other; how was he to eat them? Being well then, I set to work &amp; fixed him up &ndash; cut his bread afresh &amp; thin &amp; made sandwiches &ndash; got a plate &ndash; got staler bread (the dough wld. have killed him in a day or two) &ndash; got the orderly to promise to feed him with tea in a tea pot instead of mug &amp; generally taught some highly advanced ideas such as "plate for an Officer &amp; the meat cut up. Also wrote his wife for him &amp; did all I could. &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
<p>I escaped from the hospital &amp; caught a launch to the Hdqtrs ship the "[Arrayo?]" &ndash; a huge Pacific liner where the H.Q staff live like Kings, but all soldiers returning go on board. The launch returned &amp; put us off as she was only allowed to carry telegrams (300 yds). Got another &amp; was put on board a large trawler with others for Anzac &amp; the Hellas Officers on Aragon.</p>
<p>I had large kit bag &ndash; very heavy as full of food etc &ndash; Knox box &amp; a haversack &amp; not up to carrying huge weights, but we moved here &amp; there &amp; finally we were put on the Aragon &amp; Hellas where we were.</p>
<p>Then we reported to ships adjt. He said "all right stay here till tomorrow afternoon". I said "must go back". He said "boat gone". I said "Had already waited 24 hrs at Mudros as no one knew when the boats returned &amp; who made these mistakes &amp; why were they made when everyone was required [at the?]</p>
