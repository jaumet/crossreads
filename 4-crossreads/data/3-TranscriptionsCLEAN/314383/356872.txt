May 15th23 miles today.  Up at 3 am & on the track at 4 am.  Not feeling too well today fairly knocked up tonight.  Heat in the valleys intense therefore we all are as brown as berries.  Dick Hooper pretty bad with dysentry.  Also Young, Lake and Southgate our batmen.  These lads require all the attention instead of being what they are supposed to be, but they do their best.
May 16Easy march of 8 miles taking advantage of a rest.
