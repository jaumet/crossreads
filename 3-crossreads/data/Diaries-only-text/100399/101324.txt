August 24th March from Warloy to Beauval, a couple of miles from Doulens. I don't think that these divisions will return to the Somme front I know that we have been detached from the 4th Army to which we were temporarily. I think that the Australians have fully justified their being transferred but the price has been heavy. I think we will return to the Armentieres dist.
Aug 25th Spend day at Beauval I notice that Col Lawson has been killed in action.
Aug 26th At 1 pm we left Beauval entrained at Doulens. The country down here has completely altered in as much as the crops have been cut are stooked in long rows. For miles you can see long rows of these stooks.
Aug 27th At 3 am. we left the train at Hopoutre siding a couple of kilos from Poperinghe (Belgium) went to billets in huts a couple of miles from the town. This afternoon we went into the town which is typically Belgique very old is of some size. It is often shelled from Ypres direction. We are about 12 kilos from Ypres.
This part of the country is fine now the hops have matured there are many fields in this district which is famous for them. In the town real Brussels lace can be obtained at high prices 200 fr. for a handkerchief.
Sept 1st Move to take over D.R.S at Remi Siding about a mile the other side of Poperinghe. 
Septr 16th We have been doing very little here but indulge in sports of all kinds walks. To-day we held a Grand Sports Meeting the events were great, mounted on foot.
