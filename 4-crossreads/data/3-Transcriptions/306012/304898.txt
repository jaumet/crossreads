<p>Sunday 26th May<br/>Great activity on our right last night.  The French seventy-fives were flashing briskly along the line.  Our position here is fairly elevated.  Behind us is the Cathedral of Amiens, in front Villers Bretonneux village and Hangard on the right.  Things are very quiet in our sector.<br/>I see from the French papers that Paris is now having three meatless days in the week.  No long range guns have fired on Paris since 1st May;  the French counter-battery work has evidently been effective.</p>
<p>Monday 27th May<br/>Last night an enemy plane came over our camp &amp; dropped six bombs, luckily only one of our men was wounded.  I was in my dugout at the time (4 p.m.)</p>
