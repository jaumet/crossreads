could to get him back into the battalion.  I showed the letter to the Colonel & he wrote over to England to ask if they would return him.  About a week ago I saw Julian.  He is now brigade machine gun officer in one of the earlier brigades - I forget which.  Walter & Blue are still both well.
They have now taken it into their heads to grant leave to England.  If the war lasts long enough, every officer & man in the Australian Forces, will eventually have spent a week in England.  If I put in for it, of course I am well up in the list, but as I had a spell from the Peninsula, I don't feel justified in doing so, until all those who have not yet had a holiday have returned.  However I'm eagerly looking forward to the time when my turn comes, and will not be backward in asking for it when I think it is due.
I was very pleased to hear that Keith had his appointment, but would certainly advise him to do his utmost to get into a battalion, even though it means waiting a month or two longer.  Of course he is probably breaking his neck to get away with the first boat that leaves Australia, but I wouldn't mind betting ten to one, that anyone who leaves in a battalion two months later than his reinforcements will beat him
