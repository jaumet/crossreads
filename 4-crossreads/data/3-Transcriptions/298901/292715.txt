<p>Samedi 11th Mai<br/>Went for drugs today &amp; it developed into a big trip.  Had to go to No 14 which was at Crouy[?] &amp; then had to go on to 'Longpre' as No.14 could not supply all the stuff.  Obtained all I wanted so it was a successful day.  Roads very free very few troops on the move so we must be ready for the next push.  Our C.C.S. also are now definitely settled, so we are certainly well off for the next phase of the battle.  Trenches are still being constructed further back &amp; today I saw great numbers of French soldiers on the job.  Umpired a game of hockey at night as I feel too tired to play &amp; my indisposition has come on again.  We now have 16 proper hockey sticks the pioneers having tired of the game, gave them to us.</p>
<p>Dimanche 12th Mai<br/>Wet in the morning fine after.  Practically nothing doing.  My staff reduced again, 6 men of C section</p>
