<p>you.  Hope you like it.  You hold it firmly in your left hand &amp; waggle the bent edge with your right &amp; watch the photo.  I've run out of paper so must stop.</p>
<p>My love to Mac, &amp; Graham &amp; the Boss &amp; you.</p>
<p>Thanks for the 'bacco' &amp; food.  Also for being such a buck &amp; writing as you do.  Hope to be home soon now (soon means, next year).</p>
<p>Yours as always<br/>Jim Wilkie</p>
