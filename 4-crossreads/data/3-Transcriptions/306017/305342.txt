<p>the wind was blowing off the furnaces of hell.  An hour later we reached Sagra in scattered groups mostly &amp; here we found the NZealanders very done up &amp; they had got most of the water.  It was impossible to get any water for the horses.  The water here was brackish, but as I drank the first pint I thought it the sweetest I had ever tasted.  There was a great scramble here for water.  Men were rushing around a lot of them half silly.  Some were frothing at the mouth &amp; I saw one man put a bucket of water to his lips &amp; finish the lot.  Many more men were so weak they couldn't go on.</p>
<p>The Aust &amp; NZ ambulances were here &amp; they were able to give a lot of assistance.  For myself I drank a couple of quarts &amp; felt as though I could drink a couple of gallons.  I got my bottle full again &amp; so did most of the others.  It was no use stopping here  We had to get on &amp; water the horses &amp; it was 6 miles further on &amp; the heat was now intense.  This part of the ride</p>
