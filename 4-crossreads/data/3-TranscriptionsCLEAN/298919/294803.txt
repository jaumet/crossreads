  
 Strolled about here for some time viewing London by night.  Thinking last train left at midnight I arrived at Fenchurch St to find station closed up.  Walked down to Liverpool St, informed last train had left an hour previously.  Went to Great Eastern Hotel next door to the Station & took a room for the night.  Monday 12th July 1915.   Woke up about 9am, turned out dressed etc.  Went downstairs & paid bill.  Walked along to Fenchurch Street, caught train & arrived at Custom House at 10.30.  Just walking down to Presbytery met Priest coming towards me trained back to town went over Tower of London, viewed Traitors Gate where traitors etc in the olden days were brought
