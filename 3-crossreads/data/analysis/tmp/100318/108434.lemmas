 Edinburgh 18/7/18 and then walk down to the North British Hotel where we lunch and yarn until well after noon . Just here at the top of some step come up from the Waver station is sure the most windi place in Edinburgh and all passersbi have to here keep a hold on their hat . Went back to Abercrombi Place and a young middi from the ? Lion " was in . we had much talk about the Navi and had afternoon tea . Talk until dinner and after that had some music and spent an enjoy even in a home circl which is a rare pleasur to one after be so long away out away from all these thing . It was still quit daylight at 10.30 pm when we went to bed .
