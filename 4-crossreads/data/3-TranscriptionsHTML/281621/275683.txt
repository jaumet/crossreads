<p>Saturday 3<br/>Tonight I visited Pozieres &amp; had a look over the old ground. Everything is clean and orderly but the graveyard has been greatly augmented. The night is moonlit and the snow still covers the ground. Battery of 9.2 is by our old aid Post.</p>
<p>Thursday 8<br/>The weather is still fine but freezing cold and papers say that this is the coldest weather for many years. Fritz shells about us nightly &amp; today about a quarter of a mile up the valley.</p>
