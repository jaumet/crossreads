 November, 1915 Friday 26 Nothin doin!!! All quiet in front. So far as one side goes, but the Turks bang away, rifle, Bomb &amp; Shells in between if you listen you can hear the Grouse calling to each other &amp; an odd jackal barking &ndash; at night I mean &ndash; One would think the cannonading would have frightened all animals away &ndash; The jackals pull the dead Turks about like a Fox would a sheep.  Of course we bury all possible.
