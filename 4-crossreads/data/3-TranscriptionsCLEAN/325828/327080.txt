  
 only hope they will give me a chance of making a name for myself, for I am confident that once I got my foot on the "Aviation Ladder", (that is "to becoming a Pilot) I would go up. I thought a short time ago we were off to Ireland.  They issued us all with rifles & 200 rounds of .303's, & our MT service were "standing to" all one night, but nothing came of it.  The following day we fitted up with bombs & mach. guns) & dispatched 4 R.E 8's.  (a specially constructed type of fighting aeroplane) to Ireland   Later on in the same day we were informed by wire that the whole 4 had come croppers.  They had run into a violent storm on their way over, with the result that 1 fell into the Irish Channel, 2 landed on the Welsh coast, & the 4th was smashed when attempting a forced landing.  All the pilots luckily escaped serious injury. Snow is still coming down ever so gently & ever so softly, & by morning it will be fairly thick. Must close now, people dear, hoping this finds you all well, & not absolutely roasting while we over here are shivering, With fond love to you all & every one. Ever your loving son, Leo.
