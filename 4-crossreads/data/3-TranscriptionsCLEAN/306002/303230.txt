 18.7.15 Sun. 18th.  Last night word came along that some men were to leave the trenches at "Courtenays";  at 2 oclock this morning they were to go out & set fire to the German Officers trench & then return to "Courtenays Post" if they could;  our orders were not to fire but to try & locate position of enemy's machine guns, if they should open fire, but the night passed by without anything out of the ordinary happening to disturb us.  Dr. Fiaschi arrived on the scene this morning, he is our Reg. Dr. from now on, every one here is glad he is with us.  We had the usual amount of shelling from both sides, but we did not suffer many casualties at any rate.
