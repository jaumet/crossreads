 1st A.S.H. Egypt. Feb. 22nd 1915. 
 My dear old Belle, 
 It is very sad but I have not had an Australian mail for three weeks.  So you can just imagine how anxious I am to see a letter from Ilkley.  Suppose I shall have to have a little more patience and try to be contented. 
 We are all very happy here &amp; the weather is beautiful but think it is beginning to warm up again. 
 My movements are very uncertain at present but hope to be able to get back to Australia on transport in a few months. 
 Last Monday week seven of us, including matron, had dinner at one of the camps near by.  We had a lovely time and the boys were very delighted to have us &ndash; Believe they are arranging another one for this week but I'm afraid I wont be able to accept this time.  On Wednesday afternoon, Sister Boninely, O'Reilly &amp; self had afternoon tea with Fred at his camp
