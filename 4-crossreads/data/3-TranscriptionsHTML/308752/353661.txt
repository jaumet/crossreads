<p>Part XVI Embarkation:   Life on Troopship coming home:   Ports of call:  Arrival in Australia and Sydney.</p>
<p>The 16th Edition of my Diary.<br/>The last report of my doings on Active Service.<br/>The journey to Australia.</p>
<p>On Easter Saturday, I was discharged from hospital at Hurdcott, and returned to the A.M.C. camp at Fovant. Naturally I was feeling a little weak, but, this feeling soon wore off. Various boat rolls were compiled during the following week, and I was lucky enough to be on the roll of H.M.A.T. "China". Only three of the 8th Field Ambulance were on the list, this was unfortunate, as I would have liked to travel home with a few of my mates.

An Advance Party from the 4th Divisional Artillery were on board also. Our work was to get the boat prepared for the "main body" who will embark at Devonport on the 1st May. The majority of the troops will sleep in bunks containing a new mattress, pillow, &amp; three new blankets. All the messing utensils were brand new also. After dinner which was an exceptionally good one, leave was granted till 10 p.m.  I took the opportunity of visiting London, &amp; had a last look round the old &amp; historic city.
