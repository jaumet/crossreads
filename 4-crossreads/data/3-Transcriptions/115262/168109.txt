<p>Saturday 8 December 1917.</p>
<p>Rain eased off. Moved at 12 noon &amp; travelled to Julius. The last 3 miles was a perfect bog &amp; this with more rain at the time things were interesting.</p>
<p>Today we passed the railhead now at Ashdod.</p>
<p>There is a big Aerodrome at Julius. Counted over 25 planes out. Turkish engine &amp; rolling stock are used on the railway line.</p>
