<p>to this his game had been splendid &amp; far exceeded expectations.</p>
<p>However after this bad hole the Sentry settled down to it &amp; began to play as well as ever he played, "at the top of his game", in Australia. His driving was particularly fine.</p>
<p>When he himself could see from the "bogie" of the hole, that that the length of the drive was a very good one, even for a scratch man, it appeared to him very strange that the youngster caddying, failed to pass a single remark, good, bad, or indifferent. At last having driven a ball at least 250 yards, on soft ground, being desirous of hearing the Caddy's opinion the Sentry, on walking up to the caddy to receive the next club, passed the remark I managed to hit that one!</p>
<p>The Caddy replied, Ha yer seen Mr [dash] play? Hes drive's always up to yon tree! (only about another 100 yards further on)<br/>But does Mr [dash] play here regularly?<br/>The "Stoic" replied He's played here!</p>
<p>The caddy was referring to one of the longest drivers playing golf who probably would play on these links once or twice a year perhaps, when an open competition was held.</p>
<p>Noticing the boy's determined loyalty, whenever a dead approach was made or a long putt "sunk" the Caddy would always be ready with the name of some Scotchman, as like as not local champions, who could approach "deader" or "sink" longer putts into the hole.</p>
<p>When by accident, although the shot was really properly made &amp; played, the ball ran into the hole, a two shot hole in two, the Caddy was not to be beaten, with hesitation, as if nonplussed, for a bare second, he blurted out, as he proceeded to remove the pin &amp; lift the ball, "Any "fule" can fluke".</p>
<p>The Youngster was evidently so</p>
