<p>Sunday 10 October, 1915</p>
<p>Disembarked at 11.30.</p>
<p>Took some more interesting snaps &amp; saw a submarine in dry dock but couldn&#39;t get a photo of it.</p>
<p>Cigarettes &amp; matches were given us as we came ashore also some milk.</p>
<p>We were put in a motor ambulance &amp; then followed a drive of about &frac34; of an hour right across the island to St Georges Hospital. It was a lovely spin &amp; all the roads are perfect so we were able to go at a good pace.</p>
<p>The hospital we are in was formely a barracks &amp; it is very comfortable.</p>
<p>I am in Ward B2.</p>
<p>There is some great scenery here &amp; I am anxious to get loose amongst it with my camera.</p>
