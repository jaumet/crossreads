 Dear Judge 
 I enclose Myle's letter to my cousin, which she forwarded (by Malwa).  I did not hear direct from him. 
 And this morning came a letter from him with this little "glimpse". 
 "Sept 30th 
 .. We had an interesting letter from Myles this morning telling us about the review by the King on the 27th, of between 40 & 50 thousand Australian troops on Salisbury Plains. 
 Lieut Ferguson had change of B Company at the review  by the King  Myles heard a man say that if Lieut Ferguson was "half as good as his brother was, he would do" which is great praise from the ranks"
