Monday 3rd July
The 5th returned about noon utterly exhausted, horse and man, as they had not stopped since nine the previous night. They were successful in their purpose for they brought back to camp 109 camels and 5 prisoners. Their horses were so exhausted they could not push on for the main body.
I sent my papers in to-day along with all the other non-com for my commission and I was the only non-com recommended I know not what will come out of it as I am so use to disappointment.

Thursday 6th July
Left camp 6 am for Galban, rode 2 camels at best pace all the way only to find we had to wait 3 hours for light train, arrived at Kantara and whilst crossing pontoon bridge saw Train leaving Station, nothing else to do but camp for the night. Went to Scotch Field Amb who very hospitably put us up for the night and gave us breakfast.
