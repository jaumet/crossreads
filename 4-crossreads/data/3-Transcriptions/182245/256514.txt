<p>Fine &amp; cold. We arrived at Havre</p>
<p>in morning &amp; anchored in the stream</p>
<p>till near midday, when we</p>
<p>went up the docks. Got all our</p>
<p>Cases ect off and after waiting</p>
<p>a hell of a time got off about 9 pm</p>
<p>&amp; marched to a rest camp about</p>
<p>six miles out, where we picketed</p>
<p>the horses &amp; got to sleep in tents</p>
<p>about 12.30 AM.</p>
