  
 out of Fovant Camp at 4 PM nearly the same number wandered wearily into Sutton Vissy camp The walk was about 15 miles It was a beautifull day after the frost in the morning. Cool & bright Cannot say I am tired With a lot of struggle & strife we got blankets ticks & boards simed out & got a neary fair tea about 7 Hot stew - well it was a sort of stew. A few of us had extra tucker on the march today. Our Hut had a good fire all last night as Jones & I went straight into the coal yard & took a bag of coal It was stealing but as we did it with many looking they thought we had a right to it
