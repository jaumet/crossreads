<p>Got my pass this morning which I applied for to go to Frome with Len to see some people he knew down there so after dinner I went across to the O.T.B so after some delay Len &amp; I got away on bicycle &amp; they were bike's I can tell you one took his life in his hands riding or rather pushing them for they resembled wheelbarrows in this respect &amp; neither had brakes of any description to steady them, cost us 3/6 each for them, on our way we had to pass through Warminster so I slipped in &amp; had a look at my negatives which I was having developed.  I picked out what I wanted printed &amp; on coming outside I noticed a chap talking to Len.  I only glanced casually at him &amp; did not recognise the chap, just then Len said to me do you know</p>
