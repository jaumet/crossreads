Today a troopship went through to Alex from Australia and one of the boys started the old cry "Are we downhearted?"

The badinage from the ship lacked enthusiasm from then on.  It is really a Cruel awakening for those setting out with all the romance of war and that sort of thing heavy upon them to be suddenly popped into the East- the mystic fascinating quaint picturesque East- the country of beautiful moonlight, of soft strange bewitching music, strange people and pungent odours,  and  to find that these things are a suave and a delusion and that it is just Sand-Sand-Sand.
