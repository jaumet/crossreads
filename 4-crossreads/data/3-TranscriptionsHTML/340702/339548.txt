<p>The lights have been switched off &amp; I wonder if I will be able to see what I am trying to eat. Next item I have to walk about 5 Miles in the dark.</p>
<p>Sunday 24.3.18  Marvellous to relate the Germans are bombarding Paris from a point of 5 miles distant &amp; all these aeroplane warnings have been buckshee labour. Practically everything has been held up for about 2 Days while they were looking for the aeroplanes that were not there. 3.40P.M. I am now in a Barbers Shop and the fire engine has just rushed by warning the people to prepare for Shells (They use the raid alarms for the Bombardment now). This Bombard stunt has greatly spoiled my leave here &ndash; I would'nt mind how many shells he put in if they didnt shut down the Tubes Taxis etc. so that a fellow cannot get about.</p>
<p>Dinner at the Ostend tonight and had a box at the Opera (Faust) after. This is a most beautiful Building Even the cheapest places have Red Plush Seats. The roof is beautifully painted The only fly in the ointment is the fact that Fritz may come over at any time and cause the performance to close.</p>
<p>Tuesday 26.3.18 Had a quiet slow time yesterday. Went to see Lewis, Dined with him. danced at Hotel Moderne in the evening &amp; while there met some of the nicest women I have ever encountered.   <strike>It</strike> There is nothing nicer anywhere than a well bred English Girl.</p>
