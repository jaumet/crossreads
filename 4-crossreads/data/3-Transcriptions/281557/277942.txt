<p>their lines: our boys dug a new line &amp; occupied it: Fritz's snipers are busy also our own: on looking at what the Aust's have done here it is marvellous for the few men we have used: we deserve a spell alright:</p>
<p>August 25th  Friday<br/>Front line: again showery: up all night with shells &amp; gas: it makes me sick everytime I get a belly full: there are a good few dead about &amp; they do stink: the bones &amp; pieces of men sticking out from the parapets do not make a nice sight: Ern &amp; I went over the shell holes to what was once a redoubt but could not get in: got a few souvenirs from some equipments that were around: plenty of shells so we deserted our corner  &amp; got towards the new trench so we would be more central in case of a call: relieved by the 19th &amp; got back through a nice barage of shells: Fritz must have spotted us changing over: camped in "Death trap gully": I got a letter each from Darling, Elsie &amp; my kiddie also one from McNiels &amp; Aunt Myra: I was glad to hear from my "kiddie": I got a little whack on the hand before coming out but it was only a scratch: plenty of shells about during the night: plenty of planes about while we were in</p>
<p>Saturday August 26th <br/>Death trap Gully: showery: up about 8am: early in the morning our guns gave Fritz a shake up: one of our planes came down in our lines through engine trouble: Fritz sent over a host of shells during the morning: Sorry about poor old Peter Kemp: plenty of 'planes up lately &amp; some great duals: up to 50 can be seen up in the air at any time: buried Peter: got a letter each from Mum, Aldridge, Moyle &amp; pleased to recieve same: plenty of shells kicking around all the day</p>
