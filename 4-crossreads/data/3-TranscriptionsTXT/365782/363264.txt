 The Quest of Love My sleeping comrades never stirred, For there had been no call to arms. Still round the heights the battle rang Yet not that woke me, but a bird That somewhere sang. 
 To hear him sing made me forget Why I lay here and all such things. Straightway I felt the wind that blew. I saw the scattered clouds that let The stars shine through. 
 A flame felled all the sky!    &amp;  then, As swift, died out.  But I had seen The low black bushes on the hill. The men that stirred in pain, the men That lay so still. 
 At last the gun crashed.  Then for long The night was vivid with the light, And shaken with the roar of guns. And yet I heard a bird's clear song Ring through it once 
 I saw he moving on the slope. At each form fearfully she knelt And looked intently on the face. Then on she went again, and hope Made swift her pace.
