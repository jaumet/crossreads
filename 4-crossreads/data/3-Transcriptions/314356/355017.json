<p>spent an afternoon at Kensington, and ordered the more effective photographs of the sculpture of Mestrovic, including three camera studies by Hoppe, one of these, 'The Slave' unmounted, the remount and frame.  Then the problem will be a selection of wall pictures:  I'd intended calling at Les Warners for one of his Medici prints, but book buying left me too short.</p>
<p>Time for selecting later.  D.V.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon took Aunt Louie in to the Canadian War Paintings' exhibition.  They're a great collection, including some splendid Road Paintings of Nevinson, and a few wounderfully effective colour prints (?) of Nash.  Sims' big picture, 'Sacrifice' is very fine, and his design most original.  The only false note is a stretcher squad carrying "shoulder high" over country of deeply pool'd mud, through heavy thread rain.  As a design and painting it is both stronger and more effective than Brian</p>
