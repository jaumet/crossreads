<p>Sunday 25 November</p>
<p>Today St. Catherine's Day is a great carnival day in Paris, but the excitement took place yesterday in the streets and we of course joined in the fun.  Fine weather prevails.  Visited the big wheel &ndash; Blighty Corner &ndash; Pathe Freres Gramaphone Rooms.  Politeness of the French People is very marked.<br/>Sunday night here is very lively   It seems to be a great amusement night and the city is crowded.  Quite a merry time at the Alhambra<br/>Called on Paul de Longchamps, 14 Rue de Washington off B'de Haussmann.<br/>Australians are well liked in Paris and eyes are upon us everywhere we go</p>
