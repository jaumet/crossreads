Tuesday 20th November 1917
Moved on to DEAL & anchored there.
Passed a big lineR with stern blown in & being driven by TUGS.
We have at our table a Capt. HURLEY who has been twice to the Pole, & has been on the French salient photographing & is now en route to Palestine.
Cold & foggy.
The tucker is good & no restrictions like in England. All the Stewards are Indians & we have passengers for ports as far as Japan.
