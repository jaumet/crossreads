<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Respectfully, I beg to bring to your kindness that, I am a Christian Egyptian young-man, well acquainted with both English and Arabic Languages, and also obtained the Primary Education Certificate.</p>
<p>I heard that there are vacant posts such as interpreters and others for the British Forces.  So, Willingly I offer my-self to one of those.  I feel that my knowledge fits me for such work, although I promise to do my best to give satisfaction.  I hope that you will give your order to be appointed in any vacancy whatever it may be.</p>
<p>Should my request be granted and may you live long.  I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>
<p>Your Obedient Servant<br/>Kosta Salama</p>
<p>Will you please be so kind enough to reply me and much obliged,</p>
<p>My Address is: -<br/>Kosta Salama<br/>Abo Kebir</p>
