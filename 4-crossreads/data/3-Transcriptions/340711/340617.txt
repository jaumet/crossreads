<p>Helped with stables till 8pm---sick---slept up on deck---rained all night.</p>
<p>Saturday, 18.<br/>Very rough---raining, squally, cold---no shelter on deck---sick---bile. Went below to get hat to help with stables---couldn't get up again. Seized with kind of convulsions and had to be carried to hospital. Doctor injected morphia <strike>near</strike> over heart---do not remember much about rest of day.</p>
<p>Sunday, 19.<br/>Feeling a bit better, though far from well---temperature 96. Limited to milk and bovril. Pains in back and legs. Got up for a little while but it upset me.</p>
<p>Monday, 20.<br/>Got up this morning and had a hot sea bath and cold shower, and shave. Feel very shaky but much better. Sea calm and beautiful. Blue sky and not a movement in the ship. Slept in hospital.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 21.<br/>Discharged from hospital. One is fed there on milk and perhaps a small piece of bread, or half a cup of bovril and latter. Warned for Guard but refused to take it. However, was promised by W.O. L. a couple of N.C.O's to do posting. He failed to keep his promise and I had to do the best I could. Night bitterly cold and a rough sea. No sleep, and frozen all night. It was an eternity of nightmare. Never have I dwelt in such black depths of chagrin and hatred and disgust of the swiftly accumulating humiliations and tortures of the military machine. Bitten in the neck by a horse 5.30pm.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 22.<br/>Feeling a bit better. Living in hopes of end of voyage. I</p>
