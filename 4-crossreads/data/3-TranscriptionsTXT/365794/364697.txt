Sunday 21 October 1917Awakened at 3.30 a.m. by excited sisters hanging over boat's side & sight of land at last.  On left Africa looms darkly through the gloom - our future life lies there!  On the right the Perim lighthouse shows a revolving light (3 revolutions every 15 seconds).  We glide through straits of Bab el Mandeb and the sun rises out of the ocean with Perim island lying a little astern of us.  Passed 6 boats, 1 French man o war, during day 2 boats - we imagine - transport for Australia.Small barren islands are passed during morning.  Islands (12 Apostles) appear we imagine but are not told about 10 p.m. with lighthouse.Very hot night and the "blues" to the fore.  So ends our last Sunday on board.  A quiet day but lonely as I fear my future must now be.
