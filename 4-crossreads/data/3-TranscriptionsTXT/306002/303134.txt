8.5.15Sat. 8th.  I had a bad throat last night & bought a gargle from Fletcher & my throat is still very bad this morning.  Arthur Welch came over soon after dinner then went to Town & returned about sunset & took some letters & photos to post for me as I believe that our letters are being censored when posted in Camp.  Fell in to answer the roll call at 8 oclock & every man was issued with 150 rounds of ammunition per man.  We were also issued with knapsacks during the afternoon.  & the signallers with leg.
