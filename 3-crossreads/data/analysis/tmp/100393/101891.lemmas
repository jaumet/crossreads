 wet ground in the dark . We got into our various posit , sat down and wait . The ground was veri wet . I was sit in a pool of water . It was rain all the time and most of us were for wet through pretti cold . I was rather tire and despit my condit I dooz doze off to sleep in the littl shell hole . It must have been the rum . The attack The next thing I knew I woke with a start to hear a terrif roar of gun violent rattl of machin gun . I was then wide awak and fulli realis where I was and what was do . It was a foggi , dark , wet , miser morn . In front , in fact it seem all round us , noth could be seen but the flame flash of burst shell and behind the tremend rattl of machin gun . We had a machin gun barrag support us which was the greatest that has ever been fire . 6,000,000 bullet were fire in that barrag and in support to our battalion alon we had 4 brigad of field gun artilleri apart from other bigger gun . The nois was aw . One could not hear one 's own voic , much less anyon els 's . This barrag was not onli in front of us but also on left and right . The attack was be made along a 15 mile front . We had English on our left and French on our right . 10percent ; of the shell use that morn were smoke . The morn be damp and foggi kept the smoke down . We had not gone far when it was almost imposs to see more than a few yard . A slight breez was blow toward us , which which brought the smoke and fume of the explod shell back on us . It was not veri pleasant stuff to swallow .
