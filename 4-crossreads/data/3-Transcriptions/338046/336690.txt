<p>1918<br/>April 4<br/>still scarce so one day we salvaged some potatoes and turnips from the billet we were occupying and some bully beef and made a dry hash. It made a welcome addition to our regular food. When right in the middle of it a junior officer came in and saw us. He advised us to get it inside us and hide the traces of the peelings. I bought a candle from a young Frog who had a shop here. I said,"Combien le bougie", and he answered "3d please". I was so taken aback that I forgot to ask him where he had learnt English, as the villagers generally could not understand it, being different to the Belgiques altogether.<br/>On 6 April we had a long march of 17 kilos going through Barly, Outrebois, Autheux, to Fienvilliers. We were billeted in a barn next to the church. The next morning I had a look over the aerodrome. There were a great number of large and small fighting machines there. One had to be on the lookout to avoid descending machines, as they alight at a very fast pace- the Camels, I heard, at about 80 miles an hour. One</p>
