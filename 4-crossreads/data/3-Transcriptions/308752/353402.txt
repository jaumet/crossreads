<p>What will possibly be the most eventful year of my life has passed. The 12 long weary months of 1916 all spent on Active Service have been crowded with incidents &amp; experiences. Some of the latter naturally far from pleasant. Much travelling was done by this Unit during  the year, the early months of which were spent in Egypt, the move to France eventuating in June.</p>
<p>1917 opens very promisingly for the 8th. The boys are all together in a comfortable billet, &amp; all trust that their turn of soldiering will have ended before this date next year.</p>
