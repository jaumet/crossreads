<p>were very busy today.  Germans shelling Fleurbaix and roads behind us.  11 of our aeroplanes were up, one performing wonderfully.  This was The Mad Major's plane so we watched him very closely.  He dived to within 100 ft. of the German trenches and opened up the machine gun.  In this manner he carried on throughout the whole afternoon and Fritz had painted the sky black &amp; white with shells but couldn't hit him.  The man is indeed a marvel.  An artillery man told me today that during last night they knocked a German armoured train off the line.</p>

<p>Another lovely day.  I went to Elbow Farm for the rations.  We have decided that it is better to go for them in</p>
