I want you to get someone to buy Will an L & Co (Loewe & Coy) pipe which will cost about 11/- & spend the rest on the three dear children with best love for Xmas. It is very good of Mrs Slade to send me a pair of sox - & when they come I will write her a nice note thanking her. - In case you have not received my letter asking you to go & see Mrs C.G. Somerville I will give you her address again. Mrs C.G. Somerville \ "Brenbar" Arkland St North Sydney I forget the telephone number.
