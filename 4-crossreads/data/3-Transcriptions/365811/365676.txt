<p>3.<br/>under the control of the politicians. Of course, Northcliff denies the wicked imputation, but his modus operandi is very subtle. He uses the "Daily Mail" in the first instance to throw out feelers and watches to see how they are adopted by other London papers. If the cry proves to be popular the "Times" then comes in and drives the position home.</p>
<p>To my mind the effect on the Military authorities of this underground work must be disastrous. A great weakness of the Public Service in general in this country is the strong reluctance to take responsibility and run the risk of making a mistake, and when men like Haig and Robertson know that there are some eager eyes watching for every slip on their part to be used as an argument against them, naturally they are very much handicapped in their freedom of action.</p>
<p>Goodness knows there are muddles enough on the part of the military, largely owing to this unfortunate habit of shirking responsibility and passing it on to somebody else. For a serious mistake, even the biggest are prepared to pay the penalty, but it is a very different thing from living in an atmosphere of distrust and unsympathetic control.</p>
<p>After all, when you consider that three years ago we were absolutely non-military without experience or training, or organisation, it is marvellous to see the results we have achieved. In reaching that position we have gained experience by making mistakes. The Americans, with our previous experience, have now been nearly twelve months here at work and are not yet ready to face an army in the field; and if there was ever a time when caution was necessary it is just now, when the German Forces are so preponderating.</p>
<p>We have just got over the shock of a second Conscription vote; not a shock altogether because general opinion was very doubtful of success. I suppose the same fanatical feeling operated in Australia, and it was not noticed over here among the soldiers in particular who declared they would not fight alongside a conscript, nor would they ask any man against his will to face the privations and sufferings they had undergone; and by way of an additional weight the personal objection to Hughes amongst old Labour men and a general desire to punish the Government for administrative grievances all helped to turn the scale against success. There was no attempt at educational work exhibited by the Commonwealth, either for or against the issue.</p>
<p>The result was that the soldiers in the field mixing among themselves were influenced by the leaders of their own small coteries and never grasped the real position. The men in the hospitals showed a tendency to vote "Yes", and that I think is attributable to the fact that they come in contact with numbers of the public who are able to discuss the matter</p>
