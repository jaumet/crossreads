 Bussy -la-Daours Wagon Lines for Battery. Weather fine. Did the 4 to 5.30 am on the phone.  Fritz dropped four close to us at 11.30pm last night. Cleaned my harness, like a new set. Went for a swim with Ken . Wrote several letters in the evening whilst on shift, 10 to 12.30 am Burglar Lawrence and Abl Garfott arrived home from L'aison, at Vaire.  Sent 50 francs to O.J.  Saw a decent football match during the evening between "C" Battery and Q.R.H.A.
