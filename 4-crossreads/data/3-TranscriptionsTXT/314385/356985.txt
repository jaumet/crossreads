Wednes Sep 27thThis day was eventual.
At 8.15 a.m. we were paraded in full review order as we are to be reviewed by Gen Birdwood who arrived punctually at 9 in his car. After reviewing & addressing us he decorated 3 of our boys with the Military Medal. Who should come with him but Andy Fisher the X Premier who stood there like a dummy & spoke not a word.
The General reminded us that we would have many trench feet to deal with. After the address he visited the wards then departed.
This evening there was an interesting & exciting 20 minutes. An observation baloon broke loos and after drifting in the sky some [indecipherable] towards the enemy lines. We not being able to recover it. Some of our planes came on the scene & hovered over it just like birds & almost before we wondered what they were going to do a tongue of flame shot up out of the baloon
