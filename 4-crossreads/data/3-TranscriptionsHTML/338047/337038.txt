<p>1919<br/>May 25 [24]<br/>fell heavily &amp; woke me up.  The burgler entered &amp; turned out to be the Janitor.  He said that a lady had called to see me about an attach&eacute; case that she had lost.  She had last seen it at Bobbies where I was carrying it.</p>
<p>May 25<br/>I called at Mrs McKenzies lodgings to see her but she was out.  Went to the Aldwych, but found that she had gone to St Albans, in pursuit of the case.  I went to the Temple to church.  The church was full, so took a seat in the old circular part near the entrance.  Just before the sermon, a crowd got up &amp; went out.  The preacher, a very old man, gave out his text, &amp; another crowd got up &amp; walked out.  He had a thin piping voice.  I couldn't hear a word he said, as every few minutes someone else would get up &amp; stump out heavily over the tiled floor.  The tiles were queerly decorated with lions biting each others &amp; their own tails &amp; smiling.  Sir Geoffrey de Something or other was buried just behind me &amp;</p>
