After lunch we had a walk through the town &amp; took some photos in the native quarter.  A carriage was then taken out to Pompey's pillar &amp; the Catacombs.  We got back to the ship at 6 PM &amp; learnt that we were all to disembark at Alexandria &amp; that our unit was to be quartered at Mena House near Cairo.  Sunday 17th January  We came alongside of the wharf early in the morning &amp; commenced discharging our cargo.   We will probably be at Cairo for about two months &ndash; everything depends on how things turn out in regard to the Turkish invasion &ndash; from all accounts it is not likely to be a very serious business. I am sending this letter to London as you will be sure to get it there whereas it may miss you at any of the intermediate ports.   Later I will write &amp; let you know what our quarters at Cairo are like.  I have been keeping very well but at times get very bad attacks of homesickness.   Fred is also very well.   Very best love to the kiddies and your own dear self Yr. loving husband Will
