Monday, 27 September, 1915A lot of shelling going on all day.
Contracted a nasty sore throat gives me trouble, we are now issuing out soft food to the men arrowroot cocoa etc to those that are really sick.  We received great news to-day that the British have made a general advance in Champagne district driving the Germans write back along a front of 20 miles.  We rec the news with cheers.  Wrote home during the p.m., my throat caused a lot of trouble last night.  There was a small advance on the left during the night.
Tuesday, 28 September, 1915My throat was much worse and I had a slight touch of the flue, I never felt like doing morning sick parade but was relieved of it by the old Corporal returned from his sickness of course it puts my nose out of joint for his job but we are going to work together and make a good job of it he is a very decent chap and we are sharing our dug out together.  I lay in bed all day & the rest did me good, we started cholera injections again to-day & will continue until the Regt is finished.  Great news from France the general advance is doing splendidly, capturing 23000 prisoners & eighty guns.
