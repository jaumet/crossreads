<p>After tea Scott Olsen &amp; I sat on a rock &amp; drank in the wonderful beauties of the place.</p>
<p>Down below, thousands of feet, lay the valley of yesterdays march.  To the right &amp; left tumbled crags rear their shrivelled heads upwards, wind rain snow has carved them into most fantastic shapes.</p>
