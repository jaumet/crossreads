Capt Smart who has then in hand utterly lacks power of organization, and I have to thank him for more or less presenting the exhibition in an extemporised and unfinished condition. I was so disgusted that I did not appear at the official opening, and I believe things were more or less mixed up by the projecting man for the color work being missing.</p>
<p>Here again Smart showed his incompetence by discovering at the Iast minute that the hall for projecting purposes had been previously engaged. Everything was left until the last minute, and had I not returned from Palestine in the nick of time the whole fruits of my work would have been so much waste time. I expect to have things complete       and in satisfactory order in a week's time.</p>
