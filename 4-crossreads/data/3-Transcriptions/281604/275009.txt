<p>Brighton is an extremely pretty place with fine big buildings &amp; has two big piers &amp; the beach has a pecular formation of shingle &amp; very little sand. After spending a very decent time I left Brighton by the 2 PM train on the 25th &amp; experienced one of the Hun air raids on London the same night but it did not prevent me from having a very enjoyable evening. Next day the 26th being the last day of my furlough I left London about midday for Salisbury &amp; spent a very pleasant evening &amp; returned to camp last the same night. Next day I was warned for draft &amp; had to pass my medical &amp; dental inspection &amp; then had to stand bye. I was rather lucky for we had the next weekend in which I spent in a very satisfactory manner in Salisbury.<br/>Oct <br/>It was early Monday morning the 1st October that I came the bump for we were warned to proceed over seas that night. After having a fairly decent send off in camp we left at 8.30 PM &amp; entrained from Amesbury at 10.30. It was early next morn when we were aroused from our slumber in the train.</p>
