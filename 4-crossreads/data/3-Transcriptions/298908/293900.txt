<p>5th.  Was wofully sick last night I am still so.  I am forcing myself to eat but it's the job of the world &amp; I don't scarce care a hang what happens but luckily I have some good mates &amp; they are looking after me.  We are just about into the Bay of Biscay &amp; there is a terrible heavy swell running &amp; our old tub is dipping &amp; diving &amp; rolling like an old tub, early this morning the great "Naterland" passed us on her way to Bordeaux.  The weather is very cold &amp; a heavy sea is running I have been wet through several times for I dare not go below for any length of time &amp; there are hundreds more in the same boat.</p>
