<p>18/1/16<br/>There was no leave today. Because some of the fellows were detained by the police in the city last night. I reckon that the "John Hops" made a mark of our fellows because they were conspicuous with N.S.W. pencilled on their hat bands. The Governor of Victoria, Sir. A. Stanley came onto the ship and delivered an address. The usual rot about, "heroes going to fight." But they stop their leave because they get drunk. Holdsworth came down onto the pier and I was allowed to get off the ship to speak to him, and tell him good-bye. There was quite a crowd on the pier to tell us good &ndash;bye when the ship left the pier at 6 P.M. and anchored in the channels. We are not likely to get into mischief here.</p>
