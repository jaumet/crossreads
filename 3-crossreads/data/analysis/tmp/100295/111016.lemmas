 veri success . There is a touch of patho sad in these new ruin ; littl patch of cloth domest thing ,each speak it own tale of suffer , of home wreck , of death ruinat . Mani wall are blood splash tell the most piti tragedi of peac folk swept into etern dure their sleeptim . Everyth tell of the horror of War , of unspeak agoni wanton murder . Peopl of Ypres may you one day be reveng upon those who have demolish your citi fill your live with agoni and suffer . We return to Camp at 7.30 p.m. Oh ! , the dust ! Talk of our duststorm ! We almost had to feel our way through the troop transport pack street , that were obscur by an impenetr cloud of the earth , which is dust in the dri season mud in the wet . Whilst look at the ruin of the Cloth Hall , I notic a flock of pigeon rise from the ruin after circl around for some time return to their home in the lofti ruin . They seem to be thorough accustom to shell fire .
