  
 March 24, 25 been frightfully callous in throwing forward great masses of men, sheer weight for his success. 
 243. Mail, from Smiths, Paris, "Cathedrals of England & Wales", two E.N. books of Georgian Verse, and "Limehouse Nights", a bonser letter from Mother of Jan. 27, one from Hazel, and one from Mat. 
 Detailed for Night Duty - in Cookhouse. 
 244. Lying full in the afternoon sun finished reading of "The Vengeance of Fionn".  I'll read it again. 
 245. C. Section to a station by Ravelsberg, to take over a section station.  4th shelled out. 
 Tonight saw Mick B. and Jimmy O'F., they down from Reserve, go into line posts tomorrow. 
 March 25 246. Duty last night - Babbling and a damn dirty job, would sooner the Infantry than Cookhouse.  Turning in after a long night. 
 Met in Dressing room old Woollahra boy - Hoptroph (spelling's wrong).  He in the 1st Bgde. French Mortars.  A yarning of old Woolahrians and a long list of them dead here. 
 Bombing during the night, mostly towards Dickebusch, 3 kilos away.  Major Lee brings in late rumour of Peronne falling to the Boche. 
 Reading Burke's "Limehouse Nights", two yarns read and two gems, but for loveliness of description I like his "Twinkletoes".  Writing 4 pages of letter to Mother, 4 pages to Mat. 
 So to sleep, brought from A. Camp "'Dorian Gray", Ruskin and Murdock, but too tired to read.
