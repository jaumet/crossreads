<p>for a nice ride to Liberton 2 mile away passing some very nice Houses en route, built of Stone &amp; not near so nice as the Aberdeen Houses, back again I came through the Principal Street of Edinburgh, Princess Street, &amp; out to Murrayfield another 2 miles away, on returning I left the Car which are very slow &amp; a long way behind the times, at the top of Princess St &amp; took a stroll along the Wide Footpaths, this Street is recognised as the finest street in the United Kingdom, one side is the business Premises &amp; the other is Gardens, with Monuments here &amp; there. Edinburgh is built on 7 hills &amp; very hilly, but very picturesque, it has only one main Street Princess St &amp; the Gardens slope down until it reaches the Railway Lines, the Gardens are nicely laid out &amp; kept, &amp; then the Ground rises again where a large number of Large Flats are built, The Old Edinburgh Castle built in 626 by Edwin as a Northumbrian Fortress, stands up very high &amp; is very large, &amp; is supposed to be the Oldest building in Edinburgh, This <strike>place</strike> is a beautiful City &amp; very large &amp; has a population of about &frac12; a Million People.</p>
