<p>Sunday 23rd September</p>
<p>[This page crossed through.] Cancelled.<br/>I bought this book some time ago thinking I would not want it but I hope to keep going to the finish now.</p>
<p>Went Y.M.C.A. to Church. The usual ranting Yankee type of preacher these places go in for. I get on well with the native servants here as I address them all as "MOHAMMED". Am reading "The way of an Eagle", E. Dell &amp; trying to forget &ndash; but its desperate this waiting. Now I'm told Thursday next &ndash; others say Oct. 2. I've had to cable again to the little wife explaining delay. No Australian mails for weeks &amp; weeks now.</p>
