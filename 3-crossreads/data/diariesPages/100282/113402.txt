what a nation England is what they the nations think of us, we realize how practically the whole world is leaning on old England looking to her for lead at any rate I shall never forget the applause with which this little item was greeted, it practically brought the house down, some of the French people nearly went frantic on several occasions when English items were on, especially when in one scene on a great lattice work the girls formed a beautiful Union Jack, there was a great outburst the whole theatre rose like one man sang Rule Brittania God Save the King, the curtain went down amidst an almost indescribable scene of enthusiasm cheering. I can tell you my chest swelled out for I felt proud of being English or British for it is all the same.
Gaby Deslys the world famous dancer was performing here, also Harry Pilcer the crack American, what a pair they were I could watch them all night
