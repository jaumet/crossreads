<p>1918<br/>Oct 1<br/>calling up signal, but it was too dangerous, owing to Fritz's gun and machine gun fire, to poke our noses out and flash the answering tin disc (carried on the back of our gas helmet case) back to him. He promptly dropped a lot of bombs, but luckily he was a bad shot, and they all landed outside the village. About 4 pm Capt  Wark VC of 32nd Battn came down the street to see Achi Barber. he wanted to give Achi something from his dugout so got Don McKinnon and self to go with him to his dugout. The Hun was firing pretty continuously with a machine gun down our street   <strike>and we</strike> from Wiancourt I think, and was knocking tiles off the roofs and chipping bits off the walls. The VC hero said "My word I'm windy". Don and I wished that he had been a bit windier &ndash; enough to make him run, but he just walked. We reached his dugout and got the message to bring back. We found some rum in a bottle and had a nip each, and sat down inside the dugout entrance for a little while till Fritz eased off</p>
