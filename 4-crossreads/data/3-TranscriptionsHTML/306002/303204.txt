<p>24.6.15<br/>Thurs. 24th.  About dark last night the Turks opened fire with high explosive shrapnel shells, &amp; there was no fault with the range, they fired quite a number of shells &amp; wounded 16 New Zealanders between here &amp; the Supply Depot.  The Turks opposite us have been busy the last night or two reconstructing their trenches &amp; the bomb thrower here has been firing bombs at them on &amp; off all night.  A Sqd. Signallers relieved us at dinner time to-day &amp; Les, Stan &amp; I went for a swim this afternoon &amp; it was lovely.  The Turks succeeded in shelling &amp; sinking 3 of our water barges yesterday &amp; Tuesday &amp; have been short of water in consequence &amp; had to go about two miles towards the beach to get any to-day (to the wells), a battery of 5 inch Howitzers were landed on the beach this afternoon.</p>
