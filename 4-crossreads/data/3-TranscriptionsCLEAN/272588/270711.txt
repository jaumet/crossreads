  
 Friday 24 May Fine again & morning runs & showers & again in vogue. 
 Saturday 25 May Big Aust. mail to-day, always the most welcome. Fine & playing cricket to-day. An attack is rumoured to be made on Mont de Merris to-night. The Bosch has been shelling heavily all round the line with gas, perhaps preparatory to the second phase of the offensive.
