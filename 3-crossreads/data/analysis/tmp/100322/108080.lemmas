 20/5/19 Sutton-Veni wife is a nice woman who speak without stilt affect . In fact they might be Australian so free are they from accent . Tonight I go to dinner there with Gener and Mrs Robertson . Return to camp at 11 and went to the Order Room for a while . Saw Jack after mess . Gener Robertson call in a car . I introduc Crawford Vaughan late Premier S.A to the parti and the car then left . We were receiv by footmen who took our wrap then announc us . The Duke and Duchess introduc us to their niec Mrs Loder and we had a veri merri littl dinner parti and there was no restraint at all . Left at about 10.30 and the run home was a littl cold but dustless ? these road are so good . About midnight an attempt was made to burgl my cubicl but an alert batman frustrat it .
