<p>to Shepheards that one reads about in books.  We now return to Heliopolis I bid farewell to the girls at the Palace Hotel, &amp; go in search of Dr Griffith who lunches there to congratulate him on his engagement to Miss Hay- My time is limited now &amp; I have a number of officials looking for him- but unfortunately he has been delayed &amp; I finally go without seeing him, but whilst waiting I pass down one of the corridors &amp; who should recognise me but Essington Day- dear old boy.  I was pleased to see him.  I had made several enquiries about him but not knowing his No. or regiment its most difficult to find anyone- worse than searching a needle in a haystack.  He has had typhoid fever badly but is improving &amp; looking forward to returning to Australia for a few months.  He was in the 1st landing &amp; one of 28 of his regiment to escape unhurt.<br/>At 4 p.m. I say goodbye to friends &amp; Cairo &amp; have a pleasant journey back to Alex- part of the way conversing c 2 colonels- one Colonel C Longhand- a friend of my brother Johns.</p>
<p>7.10.1915<br/>The last few days we have been staying at the Majestic Hotel.  Tomorrow I report myself to General Babtie as ready for Lemnos so quite expect he will say to catch the first Hospital boat that is going &amp;</p>
