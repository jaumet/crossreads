As far as we can understand we are here until after Christmas. Thursday Nov 14 Still we & cold nothing doing. New Zealand sports were supposed to be held today but were postponed on account of rain. Friday Nov 15 New Zealand sports were held today in fine weather. General Allenby attended & we all witnessed a fine days sport.
