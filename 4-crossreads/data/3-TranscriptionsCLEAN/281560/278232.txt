  
 2/4/16. Our escort left us last night. A hazy day, and by the way the ship is trembling we are travelling at top speed. There was a church parade there were four Generals attending. General Birdwood inspected us, he seems a decent guy. Passed an island called "Montagne" a french convict settlement.  3/4/16. The island of Corsica was an the starboard side this morning. General Birdwood addressed us, and told some stories of Gallipoli and the Landing. He is well mannered towards us and wears a patch of service ribbons that commands respect. Because of the short rations on this ship we have nicknamed her "Starveania". But our trip is nearly finished now as we cannot be far from France.
