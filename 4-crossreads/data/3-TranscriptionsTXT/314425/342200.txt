at a ruined village known as Bussu. The Battalion comes out tonight. This is the first time that the transports have went back since the big push started on Aug 8. We will be here only for a few days when we expect to either go forward or go out for a rest as circumstances permit. There are numerous dugouts here but like Tincourt most of them are mined. The enemy is very ingenious in setting mines of all descriptions & camouflaging them to make them most innocent looking. A burial party here saw some dead Fritzes and started to bury them. When they moved the bodies a springwas released & a terrific explosion followed killing several & wounding others. This camp is most inconveniently situated for water. The horses have to be taken to Courcelles on the Somme for water about 2 1/2 or 3 miles away. Last evening it was nearly dark when we got back & we had to pitch our tarpolon after night in a shell hole. There are a large number of bomb holes around & many dead horses. The enemy bombed this village again tonight.
