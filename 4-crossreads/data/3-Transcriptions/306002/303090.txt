<p>28.3.15<br/>Sun. 28th.  Very windy &amp; dusty this morning.  Church parade as usual, but the Y.M.C.A. was cloudy with dust &amp; we had only a short service.  A lance Corporal from A Squadron died yesterday at the Heliopolis hospital from pneumonia &amp; was buried this afternoon.  Received a pass out from dinner-time, but did not go to Cairo until after tea.  Cork, Francis &amp; I went to York House, for a sing-song, &amp; returned to Heliopolis early to find there was a letter from Billy Simon &amp; one from Edie Tomlins.</p>
