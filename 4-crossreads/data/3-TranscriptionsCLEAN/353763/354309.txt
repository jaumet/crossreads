  
 most useful I admit but not the place for an energetic medical man who wants to evolve his mind by experience & actual work  -  No - the science for the Navy & every war ship is the practical application from deck to keel of science - is physical science, mathematics, physics, mechanics  -  The Beach is the happy hunting ground for the Biologist - Chemist - Hygienist & practically applied medicine & surgery  - 
 This aftn I went to the Beach about 2 pm  -  I posted my letter to you & P.  C's to England for Xmas  -  I then bought some P.cards for you which show Suva & give some detail of Fijian life  -  I then went to the library & looked over some books about Fiji & picked up some facts about the old times here  -  King Thacombau was a cannibal Chief & then converted  -  Many tales are told about him  -  I then took a 5 mile walk right round
