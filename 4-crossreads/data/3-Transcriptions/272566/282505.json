<p>Saturday 3 March</p>
<p>Frosty and bitterly cold this morning.  Left for Heilly at 9 a.m. with General Service Waggon &amp; clothes to be exchanged.  From Heilly I went into Corbie and returned to Bellevue Farm by motor lorry which was drawing a 6 inch howitzer along.  Corbie is about 18 Kilos from Albert.<br/>After tea went to picture show in Albert.</p>
