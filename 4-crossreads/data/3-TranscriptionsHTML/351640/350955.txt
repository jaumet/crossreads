<p>Mediterranean expeditionary force).   The cabled items are interesting and such as we never see here.  For instance, the information in regard to the 600,000 tons of anthracite coal for Sweeden.   There is no reason why it should not be correct, there is plenty of coal being produced in Germany, and it is probable that the miners under William II worked while the Welshmen were squabling about what they should be paid.   Training has told adown every age of the world, and it is likely to do so in favour of the Teuton in our time.   What will be the result to the map of Europe?

Never until the nature of man is changed, and the ideas of the unit and the crowd agree upon what is right.  Pilot asked long ago:   What is truth?   So to day might any common man ask:  What is right?   As no answer was given more than nineteen hundred years ago, so none can be given to day, that would be worth the uttering.  The young and uninstructed could tell you at once, but the statement would be so devoid of knowledge that it would not be worth listening to.  It is not to be thought possible by any sane mind that the different persons in even one line of thought can agree upon every point, and if they cannot then there will always be cause for quarrel mongst the sons of  men.
