 Ethel Mac has me up betimes to catch train for Nowra.  Meet Bob on station.  Entrain for Nowra on our final leave.  Hunt about for carriage with entertainment in it. No success.  Finish journey without incident.  Lassie at Kiama gives us glad eye. Arrive in Nowra to time.  Met Dave McGuiness on train.  Lunch at Stan's. Stay the night.  Take Bob up Showground & Depot. Not too well yet.  Bed fairly early.
