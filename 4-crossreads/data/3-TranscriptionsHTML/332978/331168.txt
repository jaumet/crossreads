They made a Hole in the ceiling &amp; intended escaping thro' a small window from the attic by way of a rope Green led the way &amp; make such an awful noise that he attracted the attention of several people who gave the alarm.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Green was caught the other 5 managed to effect a hurried retirement to their rooms after hauling up the rope, despite the Sentrys threats to fire if they did not let the rope alone. A search was made especially for the rope, but without success &ndash;</p>
