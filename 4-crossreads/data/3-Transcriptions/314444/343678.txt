<p>Dearest Mother Father &amp; Dear Dolly,</p>
<p>Still no mail, but there is a rumor that there is one down on the beach, so expect letters etc from you tomorrow. Will be glad to get it as we have not had any mail for a long time.<br/>Well I am getting on tip top and can manage without the stick. The wound has almost closed up and I am feeling splendid. I hope I do not get in the road of any more. No good to "Gundy". [Slang for "no good to me".]<br/>Well we have had good weather since the snow thank Heavens. We don't want too much of the snow. One thing they are giving us a rum every night now instead of once a week. The tucker is getting better too, although I could do one of the good old home dinners still. The comforts fund has not arrived yet you can bet I am watching for it &amp; will be mighty glad when it comes. I am thinking of the Asparagus &amp; I hope there is some chocolate. It is great stuff the plain chocolate.<br/>How are all my friends give them my kind regards and tell them paper is too scarce to write. I would like to write but the paper &amp; time is too scarce, so you explain to them. Tell them I am well &amp; hope to soon be back with them all especially my dear parents. Tell John &amp; Marguerette I will write the first opportunity, as I must keep some paper &amp; envelopes to write you all at home</p>
