Battle of Flanders (3rd Battle of Ypres)  (Warneton)[30th July contd]duties.Afternoon.  As mentioned about a week ago we were expecting another battle soon.  Everything seemed to point that way.  Our artillery had been hammering away at the enemy for three weeks and during the last 10 days had increased to the heavy bombardment of the war.  This bombardment extended from Warneton (almost opposite to us) right to the coast.  Trains were hurriedly passing to & fro along the newly made line with food & ammunition.  British Labor Companies had been preparing new railways.  Observation balloons - well when I say that with naked eye I could easily see 22 balloons is sufficient that something is doing.
Fritz was very nervous also & tried his best to respond to our artillery with varying success.  Stretcherbearers from our three ambulance were all warned to be ready & we had our colors (green) issued again in readiness.  Last Friday was the day fancied by everyone for the hop over but no - nothing happened and still the bombardment went on.  I really believe that that was the original date but HQ altered it for some reason.  However here we are on Monday 30th July going about our duties when at   [indecipherable] (afternoon) word came that every stretcherbearer must be in readiness to push off[The attack, also known as Battle of Passchendaele, was postponed until 31st July]
