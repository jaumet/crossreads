  
 September, 1915 Saturday 25 (Letters from Joe 19th Aug & May)  Marjorie Ritchie  rang up from Heliopolis Hospital she will be much sought after decent girls being few & far between in Cairo.  Boils  on arms again   never had them till I came to Egypt. The troops have suffered so much that a vaccine is used by Hypodermic syringe  We are inoculated for CHOLERA also, before going Gallipoli now. M.O. let me off Cholorform business & will let me have week of Massage& Bathes instead, otherwise am fit enough.
