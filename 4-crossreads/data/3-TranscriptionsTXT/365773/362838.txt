now. I am looking forward to it, although you know the old saying re the cup & the lip. The trouble in most of our units is:- we have a lot of senior officers away wounded, sick etc. & they are holding up promotion. I now have a horse which is an acquisition on a route march.I am very fit now in fact never felt fitter in my life - we are getting a decent Battalion together again, the heads wisely promoted a lot of old N.C.O's to commisioned rank, naturally being a ranker myself I think they make the best officers, in our democratic army anyway.I will close now with fondest love to R B & Self from your loving brother Ken
