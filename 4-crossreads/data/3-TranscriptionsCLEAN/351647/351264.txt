  
 Its so funny it being quite light till 10 p.m. & seeing the fellows getting to bunk in broad daylight but I suppose the days will soon start to close in. 
 I went up to the pits the other day & saw some of my old cobbers there, among them Bert Macnamara & Fred Postle.  They are well but won't be sorry when things are finished.  It must be wearing to be there, you have to be ready at any odd moment & you never know when the Germans will find you & shell you out.  Only that morning they had dropped a few shells round, I saw the holes.  I thought it rather  miraclulous  miraculous. 
 On the way home I saw my pal Tansey &  shoul  was shown where two big shells had plunged into the church.  And the was to their billet as the office to your dining room at yours. 
 That happened that morning too.  Things were quiet while I was there, they must have known. 
 Last night & the night before things
