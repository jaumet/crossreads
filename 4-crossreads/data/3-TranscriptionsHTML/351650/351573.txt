<p>Dear Mrs. John</p>
<p>I haven't written to you for ages so far as I can remember, so here goes to write to you again.  I've had some three letters from you in the meantime written about all sorts of heathen places like Darwin and so on where you have been on your travels:  by the time this letter reaches you, I trust sincerely you will be safely back at Toganmain with the restless spirit cured for ever:  after all there are devilish few places good as home, though no doubt absence at times makes one appreciate home more:  of course I'm pretty strong in that connection now, and feel as if home will do me forever after this war is done:  if it ever gets done with, but I'm pretty certain now Asquith has gone we shall be able to move forward a little and get to work on Germany next spring with renewed determination to bust her once and for all, its no use messing about here as we have been doing while Germany wins the war on the other side:  what we've got to face is one terrific battle right up and down this front so tremendous that the Germans must give way &ndash; every man England has must bring into it next spring and I'm certain Germany will crack;  this year's offensive was alright but too small by far.  I can see that now.  We shall require about three times the fighting done here on the Somme, and three times the casualties of course.</p>
<p>But this show has got to be done with a good heart, and full of determination no matter the cost.</p>
<p>And if England doesn't realize this and wake up (as indeed I think she just has), I shall sincerely begrudge the time even I have lost in messing about here on this job which, although a terrific show &amp; God knows how costly, has never so far had behind it the genuine force</p>
