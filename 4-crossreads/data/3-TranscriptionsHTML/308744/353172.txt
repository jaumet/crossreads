<p>(issued with M.E. Routine Orders dated 17/12/1917).<br/>SPECIAL ORDER OF THE DAY.</p>
<p>G.E.Q., B.E.F.<br/>15th December 1917.</p>
<p>With the capture of JERUSALEM another phase of the operations of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force has been victoriously concluded.<br/>The Commander-in-Chief desires to thank all ranks of all the Units of services in the Force for the magnificent work which has been accomplished.<br/>In forty days many strong Turkish positions have been captured and the Force has advanced some 60 miles on a front of 30 miles.<br/>The skill, gallantry and determination of all ranks have led to this result.</p>
<p>1.  The approach marches of the Desert Mounted Corps and the xxth Corps (10th, 53rd, 60th and 74th Divisions) followed by the dashing attacks of the 60th and 74th Divisions and the rapid turning movement of the Desert Mounted  Corps. Ending in the fine charge by the 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade, resulted in the capture of BEERSHEBA with many prisoners and guns.</p>
<p>2.  The stubborn resistance of the 53rd Division, unit of the Desert Mounted Corps and Imperial Camel Brigade in the difficult country north east of BEERSHEBA enabled the preparations of the xxth Corps to be completed without interference, and enabled the Commander-in-Chief to carry out his plan without diverting more than the intended number of troops to protect the right flank, despite the many and strong attacks of the enemy.</p>
<p>3.  The attack of the xxth Corps (10th, 60th and 74th Divisions) prepared with great skill by Corps and Divisional Commanders and carried out with such dash and courage by the troops, resulted in the turning of the Turkish left flank and in an advance to a depth of 9 miles through an entrenched position defended by strong forces.<br/> In this operation the Desert Mounted Corps, covering the right flank and threatening the Turkish rear, forced the Turks to begin a general retreat of their left flank.</p>
<p>4.  The artillery attack of the XXIst Corps and of the ships of the Royal Navy, skilfully arranged and carried out with great accuracy, caused heavy loss to the enemy in the GAZA sector of his defences. The success of this Bombardment was due to the loyal co-operation of the Rear Admiral S.N.O. Egypt and Red Sea,  and officers of the Royal Navy, the careful preparations of plans by Rear Admiral and G.O.C. XXIst Corps, and the good shooting of the Royal Navy and of the heavy, siege, and field artillery of the XXIst Corps.</p>
<p>5.  The two attacks on the strong defences of GAZA, carried out by the 52nd and 54th Divisions, were each completely successful, thanks to the skill with which they were thought out and prepared by G.O.C. XXIst Corps, the Divisional Commanders and the Brigade Commanders, and the great gallantry displayed by the troops who carried out the attacks.</p>
<p>6 The second attack resulted in the evacuation of GAZA by the enemy and the turning of his right flank. The  52nd and 75th Divisions at once began a pursuit which carried them in three weeks from GAZA to within a few miles of JERUSALEM.</p>
