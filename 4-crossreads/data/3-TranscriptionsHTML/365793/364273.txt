<p>June 24 think ill get it again OK. Feel like doing a damn good swear. Have been to the Doc &amp; he's going to do his best. Obtained a pass from 2 pm to 11 but will have to go easy as I only have 18 bob. Strolled round the older part of the town ran into sundry dead ends &amp; narrow highwalled lanes, &amp; unearthed a couple of Methodist Churches. Got several splendid views of the town &amp; Harbour, but the weather is dull &amp; not conducive to sight-seeing. &ndash; Several men &amp; women are in bathing &amp;</p>
