<p>30.4.18<br/>Cloudy and dull all day and stayed in bed tired but couldn't sleep much.  In aftn. read Pelman and wrote diary.  At 4 o'clock a fair number of small shells were sprinkled close to road and our dugouts.  Don't think any damage and again at 5.  Don't have to go out to-night so when rest had gone I wrote letters till 3 o'clock when Edmonds returned.  Bed very tired.</p>
<p>1.5.18<br/>Stayed in bed till 2 except to get meals &amp; then to go over with Cpl. from First Coy to act as liaison to-night.  He went over first &amp; located company and then I came over with all my gear.  Camped about 10 mins away so I came back with all my gear and had tea.  Went over at 7.30 and and out at 8.20 to Battalion and then to Coy H.Q.  No work so came home <strike>home</strike> short way and rest went home arriving at 9.40.  Wrote letters till tired and finished off other odd jobs and bed very tired.  Rest at Croix rouge.</p>
<p>2.5.18<br/>Stayed in bed nearly all day and at 6.30 went out with Kernot near Croix Rouge and marked out trenches, 100 men party at 9.30 and carried on in two places.  Carter in charge of one.  Some 4.2 wire thrown all along our trench and a lot too close for me.  Home about 12 chased by shells.</p>
<p>3.5.18<br/>Slept most of day.  Had a good bath in afternoon, cold water yesterday.  Today Edmonds and Linton went out at 2.30 to new billets at Borre</p>
