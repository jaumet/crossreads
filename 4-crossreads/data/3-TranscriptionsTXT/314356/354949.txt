 December 19, 20 waived to save an electric situation. 
 December 20 Presles Presles has a beautiful Chateau, and the staff have a weakness for Chateaus, and the unfortunate part of the whole concern &ndash; even apart from the five impossible Majors &ndash; are the ten kilos between us and Charleroi.  The 'staff' have their cars! 
 Well-billetted again, in a large double-casement window lit room, facing a park and great hill forest of dark lovely pines.  G.Q. and A.D. in separate village Billets:  we in the Chateau's lodge.  Great folk in the lodge, and this morning Madame &ndash; an older sinisterly senile dame, had our fire lit, and sent Coffee at 11. 
 Solre left yesterday morning, and a lunch &ndash; of dark beers and light and excellent Cognac &ndash; at Charleroi, in the evening an Estaminet hunt proved disastrous.  An order comes into force shortly, that no alcohol is to be sold in the Divisional area, only Beer and Wine &hellip; this rule to the Estaminet Keepers, but the quality of their sales seems uninteresting to Fav'd Authority. 
 Straight falling slow rain, and the beauty of the tall heavy pines a wounderful setting for the formal building of Fav'd Chateau.
