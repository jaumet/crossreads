June, 1915Wednesday 23Note from Laura letter that Dr Gault said Joe has a Cataract in his eye, he did not tell me that & I hope he is not hiding anything - as he is the mainstay & is of far greater consequence then if anything does happen to me. I hope W & A have paid their interest regularly - by the way I never got any wash basin from Sydney people only an Air cushion which is most useful.Love to you all Mother dear & don't worry.
