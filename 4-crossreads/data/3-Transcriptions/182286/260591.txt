<p>here this year but no use seems to be made of them. In Ireland much jam is made from them, though they need a lot of sugar for they are very bitter: and also the sticks are cut for sale a great deal over there too. In France, the people make wine&nbsp;out of these some sloes and in Russion Gin is made out of them. It is a cold weather plant entirely and the natural seasoned bark is a fine piece of wood to see in its natural state. The samples of Blackthorn around here are very very poor indeed and not worth cutting. Along the opposite direction you can see Fidworth House and the Barracks also mentioned, &nbsp;in previous letters. The rumour is that This huge Barracks and Peckam Downs and Parkhouse - where we are now&nbsp;- are all taken over for the encampment of the American troops which are now beginning to arrive over here. &nbsp;Peckham Downs were supposed to have gone to Sutton Veny, a camp near Warminster - yesterday, but I have no idea whether they have moved or not. Again and lastly, behind us lays the Parkhouse, a fine old country home, all creeper covered and standing out amongst it grounds; and the bright chalk road that leads on beyond to Quarly Hill where Cromwell at one time surveyed his trooops and the surrounding country previous to one of the early day battles. &nbsp;This locality is famous for many old Roman relics of which I have written many times previously. For all the beauty of the place none of us will be at all sorry to leave it&nbsp;for Australia, or anywhere else either other than - Parkhouse -</p>
