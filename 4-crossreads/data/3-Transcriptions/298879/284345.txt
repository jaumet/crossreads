<p>March 1915<br/>Monday 15<br/>Had a bath. First one since entering hospital   Rained, Poured through the night. A record for Egypt. Nearly all the troops out on a bivouac. They will enjoy the wet weather I do not think</p>
<p>Tuesday 16<br/>Feeling well except for a slight headache in the morning. Appetite coming on well. Very interested watching Artillerymen pull guns up and down a large sand hill for practice. They had some trouble with young horses coming down as they wanted to roll down the hill instead of coming down rationally.</p>
