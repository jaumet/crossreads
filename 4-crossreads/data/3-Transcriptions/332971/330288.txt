<p>First of all you would love the Downs the smooth soft green sloping hills that rise to a height of between 100 &amp; 800 feet and extends for miles along the country of Sussex by the Sea.  They are so still and soothing to the eye and restful for the mind I often wander over them and a favourite walk is to a little old fashioned village 4 miles away over them called Rottingdean.  It nestles quietly between the hills by the Sea &ndash; apart from the quaintness of fit its chief attraction is the old red church of St Margarets with the most beautiful windows I have ever seen designed by Sir E Burne Jones.  He is buried in the church yard there and his widow Lady Jones still lives in the house opposite the Church.  Sir Edward Carsons first wife is buried there too also William black (the Authur).</p>
<p>Another item of interest to the place is that Rudyard Kipling lived there for sometime and was a next door neighbour of the Jones.  He must have loved the little spot for of it he wrote these lines &ndash;</p>
