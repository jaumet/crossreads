Monday 11 March
Very quiet on the front to-day. Infantry changed over last night, but no casualties. A raid about 11.30 p.m. on our right appeared to be in progress. Only two casualties so far from R.A.P. Beautiful day. Our post is the easiest I have yet been on we push the patients on a tram line for about  of a mile. The country about is hilly sloping away to Ypres on the north has been much battered about in the Battle of Messines.
