In the afternoon Sgt Brindley, Clarke & I went to Adelaide & in the evening to Prospect to see Mr & Mrs Le Messurier Very nice people. Adelaide impresses one favorably. Today was rather a Gala day in aid of the 7  War Loan Also a big effort was being made to obtain recruits. Got back to Boat about midnight 
 1918 September 17 Tuesday Left the Boat about 9.30 A.M. & travelled to National Park in the Mount Lofty Ranges - getting out at Belair. We were again entertained by the V.A.Ds & some of the other local people. We were splendidly treated & had a very enjoyable day indeed. Got back to the Boat about 3 P.M. & pulled put about 5 P.M. The people of Adelaide have done everything in their power to make our visit a pleasant one & have truly succeeded in doing so. We were taken for a motor drive while at National Park & the trip was a very pleasant one driving through natural bush.
