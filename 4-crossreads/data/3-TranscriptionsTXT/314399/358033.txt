Wednesday 5 February 1919Snowed last night & part of the morning. Very heavy too.
Thursday 6 February 1919Very cold again. Everything frozen. Got a job of walking to Harfleur see all diggers saluted & were properly dressed etc  None saluted as usual but sad to say I didn't correct them. Went straight into Havre.
