 August 1915 Monday 30 Warm day   Had a good night's rest. Rather a quiet day except for a few shells and bombs in the evening. One shell unfortunately killed two of our stretcher bearers, one being literally blown to pieces 
 Tuesday 31  Fine.  German aeroplanes are busy overhead. One dropped several bombs on our gun positions. A lot of talk about a relief for us I Will be very disappointed if we do not get ours soon
