  
 Monday 9th April Cold wet & dreary day with a little snow. Had to work a new staff as a section was sent away this morning & the old one belonged to it, however managed to get a good day in. Had a huge naval gun firing nearby the report sounding like a mine going off & the huns attempted to shell 'Albert' without success the shells falling short. As I end this book things are very bright for us, the Germans retiring to new positions thus acknowledging our power. The retreat is a masterly one as expected of the enemy but cannot prevent us from running a victorious offensive later, one advance moving forward at a fast pace without any disorganisation whatever a tribute to our leaders, & we have been able to bring a force to bear on the enemy that he has not been able to reply to, most noticeable in regard to gunnery. With every hope of peace before I end my next diary I now close this one at "Aveluy" a suburb of "Albert" Somme France.
