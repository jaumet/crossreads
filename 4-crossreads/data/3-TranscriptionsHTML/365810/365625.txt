<p>I had one from Dorothy.  I have not had letters from home recently &ndash; the last was dated July 12th &ndash; yet yours were both dated September.  I can't explain the non-arrival of my home mail but am none the less &ndash; in fact I am all the more delighted when I get others.  I fancy there must be a heap of stuff somewhere chasing me around but it doesn't catch me up &ndash; I never seem to stay in any one place long enough.</p>
<p>This country we are in now is very different from the part we set out from.  It is to be expected that as you go N from the Southern boundary of Palestine where it borders on the desert &ndash; the soil should improve &amp; the population increase &amp; that is what we have found.  S of Gaza there are some "hods" where Arabs in a half-hearted fashion grow poor fruit &amp; almonds.  In between the hods they or Bedouins scratch the ground up &amp; plant barley.  Here there are, every few miles, quite modern settlements &ndash; mostly Jewish &ndash; in each case a village with good stone houses, surrounded by beautifully arranged &amp; tended orchards &ndash; oranges, almonds, grapes, olives &amp; figs being grown with a remarkable density of cultivation yet with great success.  You have heard probably of Jaffa oranges &ndash; they speak for themselves &amp; are a good recommendation for the country.  The soil is red, sandy, &amp; evidently very fertile.</p>
