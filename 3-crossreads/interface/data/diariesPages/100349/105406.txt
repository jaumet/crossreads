No alarm last night. Things are normal. Foggy weather, which is very favourable for Fritz he has retired some distance, and is still falling back. We will catch him soon enough I'm thinking.
29/2/17.
Was issued with extras, sandbags Bombs, ammunition etc. and went to the trenches, in battle order, no blankets. Were loaded like mules with all kinds of gear. Occupied the old German line in front of our Yarra Bank position. The industrious Hun had constructed deep dugouts here, which we are in and feel grateful for. Our chaps are still advancing slowly, have seized all this strong point we know as the "Maze" and have pushed him beyond the village of Thilloy a thousand yards in front.
