<p>April May 1916<br/>a man got through without a wound.  The slightly wounded were taken away as prisoners.  Most of the severely wounded must have died on the battlefield as it was 3 &amp; 4 days afterwards that we reached there.  Next day Friday the 7th LH went out &amp; buried the dead at Oghratina.  It was not a very nice job but we had had our share the day before.  An aeroplane comes over every morning &amp; drops a message.  It flies down real low so we get the news almost as quickly although we are 30 miles from the canal.  All our water, food etc is brought from the rail head by camels.  We have no tents &amp; sleep on the sand.</p>
<p>May 2nd to 7th<br/>Things are getting a trifle monotonous out here.  Of course at any time we may get some excitement as we are the furthest lot of troops out at present &amp; the Turks are reported to be in large numbers at El Arish.  So our patrols may clash at any moment.  We are doing our own cooking</p>
