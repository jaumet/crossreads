<p>hundreds of trawlers patrolling the net, today there was only a few.  Dungeness was rounded at 6.45 and Beachy Head, our last glimpse of England at 9pm.  Very strong wind blowing &amp; this &amp; the continuous splash of water against the bows lulled me to sleep.<br/><u>Tuesday 17th August 1915.</u>  At daybreak today there was no sign of the English Coast.  At 5am a promontory on the French Coast near Cherbourg was in sight.  A steaming hot cup of tea and a couple of slices of nice warm toast was very cheering at 6am and made me feel fit for another 6 hour watch.  After having <strike>my</strike> breakfast in my cabin I turned into my bunk &amp; slept until 11.30 when I had a bath got dressed and paced the deck for exercise until dinner time.  Today the sea is calm the sky clear</p>
