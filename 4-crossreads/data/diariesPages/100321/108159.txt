Sir John Hobbs was round this morning but had little to say. A small man in a big hurry. Visited our printing office to see the production of the paper. Afternoon Jack Major Pascoe called round and were discussing the projected amalgamation. After mess the officers had a euchre party and I went round. The lady of the house is named Cherie and has an anemic dirty looking husband who is as weak as she is robust. Yvonne and her Mother and Father were there but the rather squalid surroundings put me off their society. Jack Cowan is unwell and had to go to bed early. Madame heated him a brick for his feet and this is called a fiancee! Snow is still lying all around today. At lunch we had Millar who is just back from the Rhine.
