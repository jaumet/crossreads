<p>19.7.18   Yanks have been passing here on their way in (to the line) for the last 3 days at about the rate of 3 Divisions per day. One of the Drivers has just informed me that our Guns are being pulled back, Also that Fritz is massing heavily here. Well the Aussies will give him something to think about if he comes<br/>G.L. to Mum 19.7</p>
<p>22.7.18   A Fritz plane brought down another Baloon this afternoon. I don't know what he's doing elsewhere but this is the fifth Baloon he has destroyed here this week. Of course it a great sight etc. but there must be carelessness somewhere. It is always the same two or three baloons that he gets. The observers generally get clear in their Parachutes.</p>

<p>28   When the Aussies first came here, Corbie had just been evacuated by the people, &amp; tons of good things could be had for the lifting, of course Corbie was being heavily shelled as also was Amiens. Among other things the Anzacs salvaged a lot of dainty feminine Underwear &amp; being rather short of underwear themselves immediately used the ladies stuff. They went into the line soon after.</p>
