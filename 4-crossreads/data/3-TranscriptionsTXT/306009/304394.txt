 1915 July 29 Thu. Have great fun in Gezira Gardens after tea in the evenings now.  Strike up acquaintances with kiddies of all nationalities who play about there, &amp; speak to them in a mixture of French &amp; English. Quite decent practice in French conversation. My companion in these strolls is Ray Smith &ndash; a very decent chap.
