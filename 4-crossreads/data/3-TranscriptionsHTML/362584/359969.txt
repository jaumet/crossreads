<p>Dear Mrs Ferguson</p>
<p>You will not know me by name &amp; perhaps will not remember me even by sight, but I felt I should like to send you this extract to show what one of his boys thought of him your son. I felt heartsick for you when the awful news came I am sure all we mothers of the 20th were in great sympathy with you.</p>
<p>This is put in boy language but it will just give you an idea what a fine example he gave to our boys.</p>
<p>May you be helped to bear this terrible loss, only we Mothers can tell what suffering it is for you.</p>
<p>Don't bother to reply I shall understand.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Nellie Spedding.</p>
<p>My fountain pen seems out of order but you will excuse. My nerves are very bad as I write also badly.</p>
