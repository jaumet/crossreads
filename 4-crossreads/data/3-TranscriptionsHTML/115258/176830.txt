<p>25th March 1918</p>
<p>My dear Father</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know when I will be able to post this, but I think I&#39;ll start it and carry it round till I see somebody going in. Yesterday was Palm Sunday and our first day East of the Jordon, though we are still in its valley and it is all beautiful country. I wrote to Mother last on the 19th from up near Bethlehem and on that day I also sent home my last years diary by Lieut James, who is going to Australia on furlough. He is a very fine officer, was a Sergt Major when I joined up at Romani and got his star soon afterwards. He is married and lives at Newcastle. I think. The morning&nbsp;we left Bethlehem there was a frost and when we got down near Jericho, we were feeling jolly hot with only a shirt on, and yet they are only about twenty miles apart but of course Bethlehem is about 2700 feet above see level and here we&#39;re about ~ 1000 so that makes the difference</p>
