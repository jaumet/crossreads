  
 doubt at all who got the worst of it. There is a rumour, that Roumania has decided to join in on our side hope so, for that should shorten the duration of the war considerably. Sept. 1st 16 We have just had a few days rain, & every thing was in a terrible mess, the water came through the roof in the farm, & the floors were covered with mud, however it has cleared off now.  Sept. 2nd 16 Today I got another flag, also a small parcel containing some lollies & 6 packets of Capstans & Sydney Mail. Sept. 4th. Got another mail this morning & a Sunday times from Lou. Yesterday morning we were bombarded in a fairly lively manner for a few minutes. I saw shrapnell bursting right overhead, it did make us run, we were afraid that some of the high explosives which were coming over would hit our place, whilst under cover shrapnell will not do so much harm, but you must get under cover. We had the biggest fright since the stunt.
