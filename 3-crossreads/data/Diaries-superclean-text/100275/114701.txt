This afternoon the Colonel had us all formed up on the parade ground he gave us a good lecture against the gas" which we are bound to get in the Ypres Salient" where we are going for a while. It is a very dangerous thing alright we can't be too careful about it for it has life long effects on a man if he gets a bad gassing. I had a fatigue party this afternoon cleaning up a lot of garbage rubbish that was lying about round the cookhouse, it was a most disgraceful state
