<p>becomes very tiresome</p>
<p>Wednesday 10<br/>Letter from Col Green today, he is in the hospital &amp; has broken down in health: (Calais)</p>
<p>Thursday<br/>I left for Calais this morning. Picked up motor lorry to Poperhinge but missed the train However having the day to spare, I determined to try &amp; get to Calais, &amp; in a spirit of adventure set off. I was very soon on board a Motor Lorry, bound for Steenvoorde about 10 miles I stayed here for lunch &amp; set out again walking along the Hazelmick Rd It was pleasant walking. I had gone about &frac34; of a mile when a car came along &amp; I got a lift in a fine motor car right to Hazelmick about 12 miles. From here I expected to get a train</p>
