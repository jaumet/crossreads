<p>started on the trek for our new Camp known as Romani (pronounced Ro-marney) This spot is on the advanced front and the Turks only are in front of us but a good way off probably 20 miles at least The place is particularly well guarded and strongly patrolled for miles around a perfect screen is thrown out we are taking no chances in fact we never do; we know the Turk by reputation having met him before. The unfortunate Gloucester Imperial Yeomanry were badly cut up just about here through taking the Turk too cheap. From Hill 70 to here is about 15 miles but what with the twisting and turning going across the sandy desert we probably went 20 miles. Everyone experienced great difficulty in keeping awake during the long and tedious and hot march Great sand dunes are on all sides of the Camp and we are Camped down on a hollow close to a clump of palm trees. The sea breezes here are the same as Hill 70 and they are just lovely they make life worth living. Had about 3 hours sleep to day after the horses were finished with</p>
