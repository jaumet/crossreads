<p>Wed. 22nd May<br/>The weather is keeping extremely hot &amp; I am getting about in an old pair of khaki shorts and thin shirt.<br/>Our dressing station and gas centre are in an open field by the side of the road running from Daours to Amiens.  The tents are banked up with earth outside and hollowed out inside.  There are no tents available for the personnel &ndash; everyone is living in dugouts.  Two of us dug hard last night and the previous evening and have succeeded in making a good little shelter in the side of a bank not far away.  Water is scarce and only obtainable from our three water carts.</p>
