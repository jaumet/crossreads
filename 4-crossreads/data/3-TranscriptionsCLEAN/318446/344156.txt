  
 I made very excellent meals the last two evenings cooked by myself.  Yesterday's dinner menu was 
 Fried bacon & Fried bread Toast Marmalade & Swiss milk Tea - Egyptian Cigarette 
 Today's ran as follows 
 Fried Bacon Fried Bread Corned Beef Fried in Bacon fat Cabbages (machon ochies) Toast Swiss milk Tea - Egyptian Cigarette 
 Not so bad in fact.  I enjoy cooking & eating these meals more than any others.  One has to live absolutely for the moment here or else one would die of melancholia.
