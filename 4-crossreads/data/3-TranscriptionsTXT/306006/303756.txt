1-3-17Thurs 1stIn addition to the usual parades we have been having at 6 oclock tonight we had a lamp parade & had some good practice till dark. I am Sergt of the guard tonight & have to fall the guard in at 8 oclock but I am going to sleep in my hut & let the guard carry on, it is only to see that no natives come on the scene as it is stated a good many rifles etc have been stolen from here. Went to a concert for awhile tonight & it was very good, held in one of the mess huts, Sergt Harris is coming out with the Nurses next Saturday.
