<p>I have been dodging about the gardens quite a lot as you may imagine. The Melbourne people are miles ahead of us as far as gardens are concerned.  In Sydney we make use of waste spaces for advertisement hoardings, here they convert them into nice little rockeries &amp; what grand taste they display in the grouping of the plants. In the Alexandra gardens close to the city there is at present a gorgeous display of Japanese iris. The Botanical gardens are very tastefully laid out &ndash; I picked up a few tips in the matter of rockeries &amp; hope to introduce some of them to the Wurley when we return. I tried to get you on the phone last night</p>
