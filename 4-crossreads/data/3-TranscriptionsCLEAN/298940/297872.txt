  
 short as a hun, & brave in proportion: fine head, huge & good looking; Ted Farrell, once Staff Sergeant - reduced - beer soaker (not to mention rum) had eyes at night - with the redeeming feature that he has right through  since the landing at Gallipoli. Then Ash a provincial Englishman, talkative & not very strong or sensible, yet tenacious apparently; not getting the just due of his good points because of the predominant surface blemishes. He is gone in one eye. Lastly we had Kollosche - already discussed. The two good men of the party were Stafford & Kollosche!
