<p>Sunday 21 October 1917<br/>Awakened at 3.30 a.m. by excited sisters hanging over boat's side &amp; sight of land at last.  On left Africa looms darkly through the gloom &ndash; our future life lies there!  On the right the Perim lighthouse shows a revolving light (3 revolutions every 15 seconds).  We glide through straits of Bab el Mandeb and the sun rises out of the ocean with Perim island lying a little astern of us.  Passed 6 boats, 1 French man o war, during day 2 boats &ndash; we imagine &ndash; transport for Australia.<br/>Small barren islands are passed during morning.  Islands (12 Apostles) appear we imagine but are not told about 10 p.m. with lighthouse.<br/>Very hot night and the "blues" to the fore.  So ends our last Sunday on board.  A quiet day but lonely as I fear my future must now be.</p>
