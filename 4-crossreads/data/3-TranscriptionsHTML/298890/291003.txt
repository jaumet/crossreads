<p>13. Thursday<br/>Stayed home to rest but had to run around &amp; do housework so might as well have gone to caf&eacute; &amp; earned a penny.  Threatening cold day.  Alister came &amp; we had tea in the garden.</p>
<p>14. Friday<br/>Struggled down to Minerva, oh the terrible fainting feeling.  Dragged home at 5.30 &amp; went to bed.  Arose for dinner &amp; to receive Mr. Post &amp; Mme Ja[indecipherable].  Heavy rain in afternoon &amp; evening.</p>
<p>15. Saturday<br/>Cold greyish day.  Met F.P. at Piccadilly at 4 .m.  Went to see Australian pictures at Grafton Galleries.  Tea at 'Blue Bird".  Then talked a while in Park.  Came to Swiss Cottage &amp; failed to find Bambacionis.</p>
