<p>May 6th<br/>Today we had a short march &amp; three regular meals for the first time since we took the track, usually we wait until we reach camp before having a meal &amp; as water regulates the camping grounds.  We often do 16 &ndash; 20 miles before or between meals.  We were also able to purchase a quantity of eggs. Dick Hooper assisted by a Sgt. does the Q.M. job &amp; generally rides ahead &amp; purchases extra food for the party on arrival at camp</p>
<p>May 7th<br/>This morning we picked up a telegraph line repairing outfit with mules &amp; G.S. limbers.  My group were on rearguard work &amp; our job was to see the limbers into camp.  The first 10 miles</p>
