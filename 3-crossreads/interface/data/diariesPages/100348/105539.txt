7/3/16.
Slipped off to Heliopolis, and made myself comfortable in the soldiers club. Stayed there all day; came back to camp and was sitting on my angerib (a wicker bed) when Sep walked in. Gosh! I was pleased to see the priceless old feller. We went down into town and had a veritable corrobborre. He had some grand tales of Gallipoli, and I am going over to his unit the, Camel Corps tomorrow. We have been camped within a mile of one another for nearly a month and did not know it.
