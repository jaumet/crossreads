Friday 9th July 1915

A hot oppressive day – "full marching orders" parade. The atmosphere is thick & muggy, & the troops perspire freely & curse the stifling heat. As we approach the equator each day, warmer conditions prevail. Discarded cardigan jacket for the first time – others throwing off thick underwear. Rush for saloon & boat decks at night. The dull routine of ship life is unbearable – my restless nature craves for greater activity & change of purview. Nothing to see from day to day beyond the limitless expanse of the ocean – not a ship sighted for over a week.

Saturday 10th July 1915

Another hot day, calm sea – awnings necessary on well & boat decks. Boxing contest B Co. afternoon. Col. Lamrock & other officers present. Some good stoush, with a minimum of skill. One clean knock-out. Despite the uneventful voyage with its monotonous daily life, the troops display a remarkable buoyancy of spirits. Whether they realize the seriousness of the work before them in a few weeks, they do not show it by their attitude on board. One would think they were on a huge picnic or harbour excursion – their happy disposition speaks volumes for their heroic self-sacrifice for the great cause.
