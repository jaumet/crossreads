 El Arish, 22nd Dec. This camp is too good to last as usual.  There is a move or a stunt or something tonight. It is a weary world. 
 "Mag Dabeh", 23rd Dec. We left camp at six p.m. last night for a stunt to beyond Magdaba straight down the Wadi El Arish. We arrived there at daybreak having travelled all night as usual &amp; found the turks a few miles further on. Engaged them &amp; the left flank gave away at once &amp; we have chased them away out of sight.  But on the right flank they are still holding us.  It is now 1 p.m. &amp; so we have not much time before we shall have to go.  The whole division is out &amp; a battery 18 pdr. &amp; the C. Corps &amp; a mountain battery.  The horses have had no water since we started.
