<p>Gaston.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, is dining here once more to-night, yes?"  "Yes, Gaston" I replied "I am just waiting for some friends"<br/>Outside on the cobbled streets endless streams of limbers and wagons rattled by with their supplies for the great god- War.<br/>I am seated in the lounge smoking a lonely cigarette, Gaston has left me to flit about the tables, his fat face beaming, his tongue prattling out small talk to his patrons.  I begin musing as to the appearance of this resteraunt before the war, before the dark clouds rolled over Belgium, leaving death and devastation in their wake casting fear and apprehension before them.  Only eight miles in front of this town</p>
