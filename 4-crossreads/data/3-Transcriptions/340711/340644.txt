<p>Moved off with guns and Firing Battery wagons at 7 p.m. for the firing line. The night soon came on thickly---darker by far than usual---and intensified the mystery and cruel magnificence of everything. We soon passed through the old British First Line, and thence through the German First and Second Lines. Becourt Wood gloomy to intense blackness. Sausage Valley, where our difficulties commenced. We arrived, after many waits, at 11.30 p.m. The big guns, right alongside the roadway, thick everywhere, were continually on the fire. I road as brakesman on the gun trail as otherwise would not have got the trip. We rode at 20 and then 50 yard intervals to escape shrapnel.</p>
<p>We put guns in, and left wagons---and off. We returned by a much longer route (Fricourt Road). Even with the utmost will power could not keep consciousness for two minutes together for a great part of the way. Rode Cpl. Cox's and led Sgt. Whitworth's horse back.</p>
<p>Friday, 28.<br/>Got home 3.30 a.m. Then watered and fed. Reveille 7 a.m. Left at 9.30 a.m. for Pits as brakesman---was anxious to see the place by daylight. It was cruel and terrible. Great craters, shattered wire, equipment strewn everywhere; innumerable trenches, dug-outs, and guns---some in pits, others in open, but everywhere guns. Coming home we saw the big 9" Howitzers. Big Lizzie of the Somme, 15", is just opposite our horse lines. Orderly sergeant 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Saturday, 29.<br/><strike>The wh</strike> Teams left at 1.30 a.m. The whole Brigade left Wagon Line south of Albert to a position north of Albert---just the other side of the town. Left at 3.30 p.m. and arrived 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Sunday, 30.<br/>Left at 9.10 p.m. with Sgt. Cameron (in charge) and Bdr. McGowan</p>
