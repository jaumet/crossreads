<p>Monday, 13 September, 1915<br/>Spent the morning after sick parade in the trenches sniping at Turks for amusement.  The range is 600 and a difficult shot, our machine guns are in a splendid position but never a Turk will dare to come this way.  The Turks put two or three big shells over the beach at Anzac one on the hill being a high exploding we hear it killed 11 of the 13 L.H. and wounded several they had only just landed, the Turks have a 75 gun that they captured at Helles off the French and this is the only gun that ever troubles us Beachy Bill seems silenced.  Canteen stores issued to-day the men did not do so well as the L.H. as for goods.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 14 September, 1915<br/>Alf's birthday.</p>
<p>My birthday, my second on active service, I trust I never have another. It is now officially reported that the Russians have gained a wonderful strategical victory over the Germans outside Warsaw, 900 German officers being killed it seems too great to be true.  It is now stated that the big shell that came over yesterday killed only 1 but wounded five and got three N.Z. horses.  The N.Z. went to day for their spell. I wrote home again, now I have plenty of time on my hands.  The nights are getting very chilly now.</p>
