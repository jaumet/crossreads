<p>Sunday 15 [14] April 1917 [1918]<br/>No trace of Sunday breaks this prison time save that during the long lonely afternoon I indulge in old hymns, some not sung since childhood's days of long ago.  Evidently the Padre (C of E) has no time for a sick sister within his gates.  Matron does not visit me either &amp; I miss her sweet quiet talk.<br/>A menu for the day &ndash;<br/>Breakfast 7.15 a.m.  Porridge, tea, 2 hard poached eggs of doubtful age, 1 strip rancid bacon, 3 slices brown B &amp; B.<br/>Lunch 12.15 p.m.  Mince, boiled onions, mashed potatoes.<br/>Rice with curdled milk &amp; no sugar.<br/>Dinner, 6 p.m., rather greasy soup, piece fried fish, mince &amp; veg. same as lunch with addition of crowds of pepper making my throat burn.<br/>Boiled pudding <u>hard</u> &amp; <u>cold</u>!!</p>
