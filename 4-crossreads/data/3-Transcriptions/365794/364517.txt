<p>Thursday 25th April 1917 [1918]<br/>Anzac day!  A glorious morning &amp; pretty, soft day following.  Such a day as perhaps we are having "down under" on this 25th April.<br/>If only could have gone to the old Cairo Cemetery for the service or All Saints but no hope.  No visits from the medical staff &amp; no trace of Miss More so cannot ask to go out.<br/>Hear that my swab is negative again but note from M.O., Capt. Rankin, on paper asking for another to be sent so a wait of 4 days, i.e., Sunday, follows.</p>
