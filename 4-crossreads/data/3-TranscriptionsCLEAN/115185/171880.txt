Your Christmas pudding from the Civil Service I gave to them. We lighted it - and young Capt Steele of South Australia the M.O. with Lt Col Stanwell for my ward eat it - and every man had a bit. I tasted it - it was very good. We also made a plum pudding which the men eat after yours - to fill in the gaps. I only had 16 at the table and 7 in bed. All Australian soldiers as early on Christmas morn - all my English Tommies were taken on board the Aquitania - was it not a long trip for them? I believe she was a bower of fairly land loveliness. They of course got their Christmas bags etc here in the morning - we are as you know clearing the hospital and all our bad cases for the Base England left in Aquitania on Christmas day
