<p>27th Day out<br/>We sighted land this morning at 2 a.m. &amp; some of the fellows sat up and gazed at it all night.  We sighted a tramp homeward bound for Australia &amp; a native fellucca on the coast.  These &amp; a little dhow that has just come up are the first vessels we have seen since we left the West.  The coast is very mountainous.  I suppose a few miles from the coast there are lions &amp; elephants.  The sea is waveless this morning.
