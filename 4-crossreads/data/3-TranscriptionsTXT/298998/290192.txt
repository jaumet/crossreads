The number brought down, exceeded the aggregate of machines employed on the whole Somme front. The report referred to one sector only. I read many similarly exaggerated and absurd reports, but they are not worth paper space. The papers are no doubt, editored according to Hun dictation. Moreover, the misled French population, is continually tortured in this typical Hun manner. I have discovered the advisability of learning the German language.

They lack courage and coolness, this I have experienced both at the Front and here. (England er alles schwindler, England er sweinori) followed by storms of "Donnerwotter" are the only remarks received in reply to a question. If one
