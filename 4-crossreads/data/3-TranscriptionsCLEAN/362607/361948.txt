Dear Dad,
This place I visited on my trip to London. The floor is the original one of Roman Tiles. Note the Fire place & Baking oven. There are a lot of carvings by one time prisoners where X is drawn on the wall. In the Room immediately above, the Princes were murdered. 3 or 4 celebrated prisoners committed suicide in this Room.  Hence the name Bloody Tower. Sir Walter Raleigh spent 2 years here & paid   4 a week for it. The Portcullis shown in 5 & 6 are in the corridor to the left of the Picture. The Board marked X. X was placed where it is when the inner Portcullis was removed.  Harry
