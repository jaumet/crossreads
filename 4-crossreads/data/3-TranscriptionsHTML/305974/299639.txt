<p>17 Thursday<br/>We have been divide since we arrived he one lot going to the 1st division &amp; the other lot going to the 2nd division.  I am in the 2nd division.  The camp seems to be a dusty place. There is every convenience &amp; the food seems to be rather good.  Medical inspection held in the morning.  Rained very hard in the afternoon. Went on swimming parade in the afternoon to the sea about 5 miles away had a good swim no breakers though.</p>
<p>18 Friday<br/>We don't do any drill here.  Rained during the early hrs in the morning. Fell in 7.45 am to go to what is known as the "bull ring".  It is about 3 miles away.  We went through a course of bomb throwing.  a lecture &amp; practice with the Poisonous gas helmets, a lecture regarding the first field dressings.  We then went through the real gas, also the tear chemical, the latter is a chemical used to prevent you seeing, it also plays up on your eyes, it smells like pineapple, &amp;  is rather nice smelling.</p>
<p>19 Saturday<br/>After a lot of fooling about we got paid.  I drew 30frs or &pound; 1-1-6.  We also received an issue of tobacco, we could either have a 4 oz tin or 4 packs of cigarettes, I gave my cigarettes away.  Went down to the siding &amp; saw some troops go into the line.  Went for a walk in the evening.</p>
