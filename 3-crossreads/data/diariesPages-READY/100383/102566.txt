Ypres There is very little to be seen now except ruins but the cathedral known as Cloth Hall & the Asylum & City Gates known as "Lille Gates" are the only big places that can be made out. There is also a big bell which is kept at Lille Gates & well guarded & it is the most costly bell in the world. The story goes that a collection was called for throughout Belgium & there was that much copper & silver collected that it was all melted down & made into the bell & it could be heard for twenty odd miles & was in the tower of the Cathedral before the war.

The old church is still to be seen but has been hit several times by Alien shells but no great damage has been done to it.
