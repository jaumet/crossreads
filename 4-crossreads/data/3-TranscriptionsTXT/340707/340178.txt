The Frenchman is superficially polite but under the surface he lacks all the finer feeling for his women that we possess He will thrust her out of his way in a rush for seats. Never will he offer his seat to a lady. Women will offer their seats to crippled soldiers or women with baby in arms & occasionally a young man will do the same thing but this is rare.

After dinner to night Clements intends to visit Nostre Rogis & I dig out Cailloud to accompany us. After a drink of wine in his atelier we set off & visit Nostre Logis
Singing is exceptionally good this evening. Everyone seems to excel. Cailloud finds a modele & makes a appointment with her but he is like all Frenchmen never confident in a womans promise & says perhaps she will be there & perhaps not.
After a while I try to sleep for 6 am very tired. In fact the sleeping fits that used to trouble at Woolwich seem to have returned. Perhaps it is weakness owing to lack of nutriment I have only 1 meal per day & in morning a little dry bread & cheese & water. This is my every day fare & perhaps is not sufficient but if I do not live in this manner I should have no money
