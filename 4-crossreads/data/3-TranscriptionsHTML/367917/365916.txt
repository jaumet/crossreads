<p>10.<br/>I am glad to hear that Keith is progressing. But don't you think that the impediment in his speech will be a serious hindrance to him in the law, unless indeed he means to put it to advantage in earning refreshers in Equity. However I suspect that you have good grounds for hoping for its gradual cure.</p>
<p>This letter I am afraid must seem made up of envy malice hatred and all uncharitableness &ndash; mostly the effect of the cold. The nights grow chilly, and the prospect of a winter in some damaged village up front is not cheering. To tell the truth I believe I am getting fed up on this war.</p>
<p>Goodbye<br/>Eric Brissenden</p>
