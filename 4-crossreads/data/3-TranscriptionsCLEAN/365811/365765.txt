 Enemy armoured cars had been seen here, and cavalry there - the air was thick with rumour of disaster. And then just in the nick of time three Australian Divisions lined up between Fritz and Amiens, and so far that has been the end of his advance on this front. 
 We have handed over positions to British Divisions which have then been pushed out, but we have always retaken them again. The last case was Villers-Bretonneux which we handed over to the 8th. The position overlooks the whole country right into Amiens.
