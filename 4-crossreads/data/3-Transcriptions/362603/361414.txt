<p>4.  think I told you.  We have a chest of drawers in our Room now &amp; we have the Family Group on the Dressing Table.  We have a lovely room to ourselves &amp; are as comfy as Comfy can be.  We often say Well, Dad &amp; Mum must be worrying about us &amp; look at us.  If you could only see how comfy we are you would laugh at Your fears.<br/>The Colonel was in making His usual inspection &amp; did not know it was Our Room.  He did laugh when He saw how homely we had made the place.  Of course you wan't to let people think we are having a hard time.<br/>Best of Love<br/>From Harry</p>
