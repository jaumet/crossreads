 Wednesday 31 October 1917 Very little sleep T. 101, 102, P. 84, R. 24 during day &amp; night. Feeling less ill. Again am thoroughly examined in chest &amp; now they search for spots on abd. &amp; back &amp; Capt. again tries the luckless spleen!  Nothing to be found.  After having Cal. gr. I my condition evidently intends to improve.  On asking if I may see Cobbie, home sister says, "must ask Capt.", therefore feeling a little sarcastic Betsy composes a few little sick room queries.
