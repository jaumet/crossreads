<p>3/1/16<br/>Piercingly cold. On morning parade wind cut right through one's clothes. Did some skirmishing &amp; manouevering over skylines &amp;c. Returning from our walk yesterday we met some men well oiled. We won't be sorry to reach warm Egypt again. The women wear a white kerchief for head dress and when in villages wear shoes which they carry in their hands later on when on the road. The dwellings of the plough men and lower class are rude to the extreme and the same roof shelters horses pigs &amp; poultry as well. The men are now wearing sheepskin coats. Their wooden ploughs have an iron tipped share.</p>
<p>Such fishing craft as are about are lateen sailed. Some queer vessels skirt the coast of Africa both north &amp; south of the Canal but the wickedest are these piratical looking rakish rigs. The very look of them is redolent of rascality, smuggling and all other nautical vices. The disreputable appearance of the craft is usually matched by that of their crew, swarthy dark skinned sharp eyed rascals that would as lief crack a head as a nut of any other kind. You might call these craft the larrikins of the high seas. Rather than frequent large harbours, they favour the bypaths secluded coves &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we practised artillery formations &amp; we coached up our guard which mounts tomorrow. Brigadier says all or part of us are certain to sail tomorrow so made preliminary preparations. Present indications point to a sojourn on the Canal. Dr Craig &amp; McKay went to a dance at 2nd AGH but I had to remain here in case of orders. The big four funneled hospital ship left this afternoon. Sea rough &amp; white caps dancing in the sun. Bed and slept soundly.</p>
