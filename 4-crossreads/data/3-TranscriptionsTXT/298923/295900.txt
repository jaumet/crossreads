 22 August 1918 Thursday Put 80 men into trenches again where Germans attacked us last &amp; moved Camp up the Wadi.  Dust worse than ever, but certainly cooler. We are staffing the  B.W.I.     I don't suppose you know who they are  but cannot write it plainer.   Posted notes yesterday hope they arrive &amp;  ate your PLUM PUDDING on arriving into our new Bivouac area-  I have now done 4 years of war = 2 years S.A. makes 6 years active service.  I suppose the world will owe us at least a living if we come out &amp; are willing to work.
