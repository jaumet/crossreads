  
 Sat. July 7th  Spent a rotten morning at Squad Drill.  After Dinner we gave our tin Hats in to get painted.  Frank Woods returned from Blighty. 
 Sunday July 8   Another Air raid on London.  That's Bad news.  It's nice to know that the Frenchmen shook Krupps up a bit   Gen. Holmes killed & Billy Holman suffering from shell shock.  Fritz is doing some damage this  week, but our turn will come.  It rained heavily this morning, & we had to go to Henencourt again to practise for a display before the King on Thursday.  Finished Letter 24 to M.S. also posted her some P. Cards & a few copies of the "Tattoo". 
  Sunday  Monday July 9  Mother's Birthday Another wet day.  Went out to Henencourt again & put in some good work preparing for the great event next Thursday.  Yesterday Tom Shearer fell foul of Barrisgill & he is banned from drilling with the Botts.  The weather cleared up after Dinner & two scratch Teams played Rugby League.  A very enjoyable & amusing game.
