<p>26 April 1918 Friday (X to X crossed out)<br/>Refugees (all Christians) Arabs) continue to pass, as the Circassians &amp; Turks are killing &amp; robbing all who try to come in.  Sheriff of Mecca is not far away now, &amp; our armed Motor boats on the <strike>Dead</strike> Sea cease firing this morning- so we keep on. X I not only have that old affliction of Ezcema but Dobie: itch as well cannot cure without disinfecting under clothing- impossible on A.S. but the water in Jordan &amp; Dead Sea is full of sulphur &amp; good for these troubles-  Went out to cover a Troop which was ambushed coming from Madeba.X</p>
