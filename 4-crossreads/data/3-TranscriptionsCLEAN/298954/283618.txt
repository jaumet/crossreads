(cont) Sat 6th Apl.Lots of Irish, including two padres (Fitzmaurice and Casey.)
We formed fours outside and were marched to the lager - a collection of wooden huts inside much barbed-wire in a corner of the Stadtgarten.   There is a decent-walk under a avenue of chestnuts, but no room elsewhere.   One hut is a mess-room, another is an amusement-hall & boasts two billiard tables, a library (French and English), a piano, & a curtained off stage.
The sleeping huts are divided off into rooms containing about 8 camp-beds & 2 wooden tables.
Everything is very clean except the mattresses, which are filled with wood-shavings and are alive with vermin (assorted.)
Orderlies, of ones own nationality, are provided for English, French, & Italians.
