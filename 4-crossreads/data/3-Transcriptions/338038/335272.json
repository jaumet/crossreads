<p>I have visited the Fishers there won't be much of my leave left for running about.</p>
<p>There is a meet of the Surrey Union Foxhounds here on Saturday week, and although the quality of the <strike>fo</strike> hunting has deteriorated greatly since the war, I am looking forward to it greatly. Nearly all the families have managed to retain some sort of a neddy that can "lep" a bit.</p>
<p>Had a visit yesterday from a Mrs Carse the wife of my senior subaltern. They are Melbourne people (relatives of the Falbeniers of Riverina) but Mrs C is living at the Isle of Wight while her husband is at the war.</p>
<p>Have written to Del Stott also but her reply I think was forwarded on to me to France. However I will write again, and try and see her before I return to the front.</p>
<p>Ted &amp; Sis have not been up since, but they write almost every</p>
