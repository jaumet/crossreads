  
 last Sunday from Col Owen who commanded the 3d Battalion - he was critically in the spot where Frank met his death. I do hope you will have good news of  your  dear ones. - That 'Enola' business was a tragedy - almost nine 10 times the landing on the 25th April! My daughter in law & her mum are still in London with her [indecipherable]. I hope they will be arriving here mid year. It would be a very great pleasure to my wife & myself to welcome you to England - our in hospital where tiny life is born - there may be a chance of seeing you. Kindest regards in which my wife joins me Always very sincerely yours  Duncan Timms
