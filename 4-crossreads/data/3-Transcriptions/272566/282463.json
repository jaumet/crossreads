<p>Saturday 20 January</p>
<p>I wasn't feeling too well today so did not go out with the others from "A" Section who were taken out to carry on with the building of a new A.A.D.S. some 4 miles to the right of our present No. 3 (or Battery) Post.  Freezing cold and frosty &ndash; Ground still white with snow.</p>
