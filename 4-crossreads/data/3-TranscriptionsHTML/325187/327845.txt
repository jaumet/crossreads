<p>Am fast forgetting all about the Peninsular as I have forgotten Elands River &amp; past droughts.  What a happy thing it is we can do so.<br/>Severe Khamsin or Monsoon, Dust storm, like a good Riverina Dust storm.  Enclose more snaps of Nile etc. (I am not likely to forget you Mother.)<br/>I have come to the conclusion the Egyptians are SNOBS, when introducing anyone the formula is "He is a very rich man" or "I am the son of a BEY or PASHA" - &amp; they are always keen to know one's rank etc etc:- the result of years of slavery to the Turks I suppose.<br/>Posted Joe a Tarbush or Fez tonight's mail hope he gets it.</p>
