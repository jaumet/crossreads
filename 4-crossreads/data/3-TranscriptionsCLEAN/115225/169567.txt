 May 25  th    We went to Ailly-S.S. for petrol & oil & then did a trip to Hangest for water with the trailer,  du  we did'nt do any job for the froggies to-day - We had a swim in the evening & rigged up a spring-board at the pool - it is very good - 
   
 May 26  th    We slept in till 7.A.M. & took Ren & an escort to Bertangles for court martial for refusing to go on guard whilst we were at Allonville (he & two other men joined us there)  We got back at noon & greased & oiled up in the afternoon. 
   
 May 27  th    We had to load up our echylon of amunition (the echelon is a reserve of ammo a full load for every lorry to be ready in case of emergency, a very fine idea but incidently the cause of a lot of trouble etc) & delivered it to a dump at Querrieu. & went to Flesselles for another load which we had to keep on the lorry all night. We are supposed to have a load of ammo always on the lorry but we would so often have to unload & load it as ocasion required, that we did'nt keep to the letter of the law & we put it off at the side of the lorry & covered it against the weather - 
   
 May 28  th    We delivered our load of ammo.
