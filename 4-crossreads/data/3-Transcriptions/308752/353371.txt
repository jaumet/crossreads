<p>dug-out was over 50 feet deep &amp; contained 4 rooms. We found about 20 runners &amp; a squad of signallers there, so of course there was very little room for 26 bearers. We scrambled in somehow, &amp; were there for 36 hours. Our rations consisted of two loaves of bread, two tins of butter, two tins of jam, &amp; two tins of army rations, not a quarter enough for 26 men. The carry from the R.A.P. to the next relay post, was close on a mile, &amp; a terrible road, mud &amp; water feet deep, the poor patient had a bad time of it, as we often slipped in the mud &amp; almost pitched the patient out of the stretcher. Judging from the roar of the guns &amp; the illumination of the sky, it must be hell in the front line. I believe our men are wet through, rifles &amp; machine guns choked with mud, &amp; very little food is available. It is too terrible to write about. It is really wonderful the advance the British have made here, the place must have been a second Gibraltar. The wastage lying about is enormous, rifles, clothing, ammunition, barb wire etc. When one remembers that some of these shells cost &pound;300/./. each, we cannot realise the vast sum of money that is wasted. At 7 p.m. the following day we were relieved, &amp; we started on our long trip back to our home or dug-outs.  Unfortunately we got lost again &amp; walked about for hours in a hopeless fashion, a number of us kept falling down in the mud &amp; shell holes, mud up to the knees, an awful experience, especially as an artillery duel was taking place. It was also pitch dark &amp; raining heavily. Arrived at our dug-outs at 1 a.m. all dog tired &amp; weary. Found to our disgust that the cook had gone to bed, &amp; the stew was cold. An enormous amount of sickness in the Ambulance, &amp; I don't wonder at it. Received a big mail 13 letters, but had to leave the reading of them till the next day,</p>
