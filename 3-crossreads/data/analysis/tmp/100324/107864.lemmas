 6/9/15 Johnston Jolli of the 6th Bn . The HQ is a littl semi-dugout semi lean to and from it I have a wonder view over the danc Agean Sea blue in the sun and a dream island call Samothrac and anoth call Imbros lie lie jewel out among the white pranc sea . In the foreground are store ship and other lie at anchor but they keep out of gun rang . Look down ? a larg gulli sandi , steep on both side with scatter scrub . At 2 pm went through trench with Lieut Guilfoyl . Look through periscop there was noth to be seen but a confus mass of tumbl earth and sandbag ? the Turkish trench about 250 yard in front . Absolut no one or no thing in sight and yet we know they are there right enough .
