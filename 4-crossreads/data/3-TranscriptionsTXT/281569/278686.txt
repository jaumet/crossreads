Still further news of the Russian offensive, the Germans have come up but are not strong enough to push the Russians back, they still continue to advance & collect huge quantities of booty.
Aero reconnaissence today shows little movement in the enemy although out Salmana way back of large convoys are noticeable our boys should be returning from the Stunt now & glad to get home. Heaps of shipping on the canal & I myself spent the greater part of my time dividing its waters & was in up to 10.30 pm, full moon & what nights wasted, little activity in the office no luck with Alec so far, hope to succeed when in Cairo. Bed at 11 tired out.
