I need hardly add that it is anything but warm flying this weather.  The other morning whilst up testing a machine I felt the wind & cold pierce like a knife altho' clad in the usual leather coat & fur lined cap.Did I tell you, Dad that the application that I put in a fortnight ago for a Pilot was turned down for the 3rd time.  I was heartily disappointed, & when I the Major was in a good mood a few days later I asked him why he had turned me down.  He explained that as I had a somewhat difficult & responsible job, & I had thoroughly grasped & understood my work, (as he found out when I was away on 6 days leave) he couldn't afford to lose me.  Of course all this was like soft soap to this kid, & it didn't go very far with me.  However a day or two ago, it came through orders that No 6359 1st A/M Waterhouse J.L.L. to be Corporal from 1st inst, so now that I am strolling round with 2 bars on my arm, & greeted everywhere with "Hello, Co-orporal."  Kiss me Corporal" etc.  To-night the Orderly Sgt has just put me in charge of a hut of 30 men, so that it looks like a case of "out of the frying pan etc."I have an exceptionally heavy cold in my head at present, which at time makes me feel somewhat deaf, but otherwise I am enjoying splendid health.Sometimes I feel heartily ashamed of myself over [torn page] in absolute safety, & comfortable, whilst those poor wretches over the other side are enduring all sorts of hell upon earth.  I am going to try again this month for a Pilot [torn page]
