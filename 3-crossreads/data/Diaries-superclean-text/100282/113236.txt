have a look at the Directory which I did, soon found out where he was Kirby was the place so out I goes only to find the whole family away, only the servants home, at any rate I stopped the night there, it was the most beautifully furnished home I have ever saw, must have cost thousands of pounds, next morning caught the train at Lime Street station so on to London. I had only a fleeting glimpse of Liverpool she struck me as being a particularly dirty place made it seem worse I suppose after Edinburgh which is so clean. Lancashire which we passed through is nothing but a mass of factories, chimneys wherever you look pouring great volumes of black smoke out, seemed to be some fine crops there too took us 5 hours to get to London I can tell you I was fed up
