With the 47th Divn B.E.F. for 6 weeks as Chief Instructor of the Divnl School & Liaison Officer for Trench Raiding.
FRANCE.
Saturday 18th Mrch 1917.
My Dear Ones.
For the last twelve days I have been away from home, that is to say away from the Battalion and attached to the Headquarters of an English Division ^47th Divsn B.E.F. newly arrived in France, and they asked our Division for for a "Liaison Officer," they had heard of our great success in "Raids."  The request was granted and I received the compliments of being the officer chosen; for have I not come safely thru' three raids and been quite successful too, particularly the last.
   Well, the days have been strenuous, for as well as a daily lecture of one hour and training the Raiding parties all the plans have been made or passed, criticized and even discarded by we two, this "we two" includes Manning, a 2nd Lieut.of the New Zealand Rifles, also attached for the same purpose, he's a splendid fellow and knows this front intimate-ly.  (Later Lieut Ivan Manning M.C.   K.I.A.)
   Just at first the Brigadier Generals of the Brigades used to send for us and we would visit them in the Divisional Car, but finding that that wasted so much of our time, H.Q. asked them to call upon us, as they now do, but even then they do run away with so much time that we find ourselves busy for all our waking hours; but today is Sunday and I have snatched a little time to write.
   Manning and myself are living together in a roomy little hut built of weatherboard with composition roofing
Cul-de Sac Farm near Sailly.
