<p>Sun. 28th. Nov.<br/>Snowed last night &amp; today is bitterly cold.<br/>We will suffer here when Winter gets us properly.</p>
<p>Tues. 30th. Nov.<br/>Our "Silent Ruse" of 3 days dimension commences today.<br/>No firing to be done &amp; no one to move about more than is necessary. I wonder if "Jacko" will come at us.</p>
<p>Sat. Dec. 11th: &ndash;<br/>Moved into firing line at "Allah" Gully relieving 7th Light horse on right Flank,</p>
<p>Sat. Dec. 18th 1915.<br/>Getting ready all day for our "historic slope"; we will be like "Anthony Hordern's"<br/>All the tracks have been marked out with spilt Flour, rice or anything white so as there will be no losing the way down to the beach.<br/>Been burning stores for the last few days &amp; what we can't carry we are spoiling.<br/>A few weeks ago we couldn't rise a pair of dry socks &amp; now we are putting on a fresh brand-new outfit of underclothes twice a day.<br/>Could have a new lost every minute only we are too tired to change. We have been marched up from the beach a few times a day</p>
