 Dear Dad, Mother & George, 
 We had to march across this Bridge on our entry into this camp. I brought some grapes on the left as I came out. My first purchase on French soil. They have just hoisted the union Jack on Top of the Wireless Mast. We hear that the War is over but we hear so many rumours that we sceptic about everything. Well we expect to march onto Havre to-day so I must go & pack up at once. Love to you all   Harry
