Thursday 9 August 1917
Am hunting up VIVIAN PRICE's grave, he died here & I hope to get a photo to send to the MILLS family. Left Ernie Armstrong of GUNBAR in the Hospital in Cairo . He is a full blown trooper & has RHEUMATISM. A moist heat here like Sydney & it does not agree with me. Am sending you some little water colours done by an Arabian Artist here. They want mounting.
