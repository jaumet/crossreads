  
 October 1918. Thursday 3 
 On right of Bellicourt, Bty Position. Weather fine and warm I feel very sad today for one of my very best pals Smithie has left for Australia. Several other fellows in this Battery have all gone to Australia today. An attack this morning resulted in the capture of Ramicourt with over 3000 prisoners. Packed up to move out for a spell today, but did not go. We are to go into action for a stunt on 5th tomorrow morning, as this mornings work has left us out of range. Believe we are to go in the line again tomorrow.
