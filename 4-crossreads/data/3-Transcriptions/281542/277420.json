<p>Frightful devastating storm at night.  Thunder lightning and rain.  Hellish weather all day, which developed into a veritable inferno of storm &amp; tempest as night approached.  Rain fell in torrents, the wind howled along in terrific gusts.  Great damage to piers &amp; beach works, &amp; saps &amp; road work in the several "deres".  Some saps are have been converted into raging torrents &amp; practically impassable.</p>

<p>Splitting headache today.  Body has been covered with blood rash for many days now, &amp; the irritation has kept me awake at nights until it has become well nigh insufferable.  I feel like if I could scratch my bowels out.</p>
