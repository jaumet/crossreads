time give a whistle a couple of Germans will jump up wave to you. This morning Jock I were signalling away to one of them when Jock collars a rifle holds it up in full view of the Fritz made a motion of pitching over his shoulder as if he was tired of war. Fritz was watching the performance closely then he collars his rifle goes through the same movements.
