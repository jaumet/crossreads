Sunday April 29.1917Yesterday evening it turned hot and sultry and it is again very close to day.  Our stores is surrounded by Batteries, and they kept up an intermittent fire all night and early this morning.  I saw some Belgian soldiers last evening. They are dressed different to the French their uniform being dark blue while that of the French is steel grey, or perhaps it can be better described as a blue grey.There was a lot of cleaning up to do this morning in order to make the rooms fit for receiving the stores which the A.S.C. delivered before dinner.  Our own transports delivered the coal and coke & charcoal.
Our issue of rations are exceptionally good during the past few months.  In addition to the issue of tobacco, we get an issue of oranges several times a week which are much appreciated.  As their are no civilians living about here we do not get any newspapers, which is a drawback.  I am told that the billets down at the trenches are carved out of the ridge of hills running parallel to the trenches & are something marvellous, & are absolutely shell proof, but the trenches are a very hot place[Shorthand entry not transcribed]
