<p>Tues. 25th July.<br/>Bombardment still going on &amp; we are just in the right place to catch things now that we are in these support trenches just a short distance from the front. When we were close to the relief last night I was one of those placed at intervals along the blown &ndash;out trench to keep up communicating with "C" Coy on our right &amp; to close up the gap caused by the demolished trench. We were kept busy with a "banjo" &amp; sandbags trying to put up a bit of cover for our stay.<br/>The officer (Pugh) who took over the Coy after Captain Pearce was evacuated came along the trench to tell us to be prepared to move when the relief came &amp; he said "Wake those men up &amp; tell them to get ready" But the poor fellows around were beyond the waking process as they were the killed of the afternoon.</p>
