Away over the hills a machine gun is rattling away in its methodical maddening song. Like someone testing a noisy motor bike; the intermittent popping of the infantry practice is echoed from the pyramids. Sometimes an 18 pounder booms over the sand hills followed by the queer sound of bursting shrapnel like a big cart load of stones being dumped on a road. 
In front of me sits a grey crow with a black hood two dingo like pariah dogs with curled tails view me suspiciously. The sun glints on the silver anklets of a woman of the village the sound of trumpets comes down the breeze. 
I shall be glad indeed to take the warpath altho this is interesting enough this training becomes deadly. I seldom go to Cairo now its too far, too costly. However the move must come some day. I must abide in patience. How will it all end! 
I often think, in fact I always think of you far away and your quiet life. I think how strange it is that I would be elected the wanderer of the family. It must be some ancestral reason that sets me off on restless escapades. I sincerely believe in my prophetic sense. I felt this coming months ago. Also I felt once I shall return some day. Certainly a wiser I hope not a sadder man. I feel about 28 altho I have now a fine sprinkle of grey in my hair. The life fascinates me. 
I have never got your letters of which Viva adresed me. She complains I don't write ? I've written pads of letters which must turn up some day. 
I had 4 1 paper from her. Tell her to be patient. I am not neglectful but letters always go astray in this game. Praps you may not hear in 3 months a line but word will come at last.
