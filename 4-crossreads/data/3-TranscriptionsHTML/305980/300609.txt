<p>November</p>
<p>1:  Unit 40% under strength, men going away daily with malaria, 3 of our boys died during the past twelve days.  Left Amman at 8 a.m. reaching Es Salt (24 miles) for tea &amp; camped there for the night.  We then moved on to Shunet Nimrin, Tel at el Dunm, Jerusalem, Latron, stopping at each place for the night, all travelling being done during the day.  Had a good night's fun at Mrs. Chisholm's canteen at Jerusalem, as she made all preparations for our meals &amp; placed a room &amp; a piano at our disposal for a musical evening.</p>
<p>7:  Reached Richon at 5 p.m. after a journey of about 125 miles.  Good camp.  Rations reduced 10% as we are not in the line at present.</p>
<p>8: Gave 1914 men a hearty send off- twenty one from our gun squadron.</p>
<p>11: News through of an armistice with Huns.  Flares &amp; Verry lights of various colours illuminated the camp for miles &amp; presented a very pretty sight.  Boys had a good issue of Richon wine &amp; made merry when the news came through.  Batteries opened up, making one think war had commenced instead of ending.</p>
