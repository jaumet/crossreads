 9/9/17 Campagne The 21st paraded with us on our ground for church parade conducted by Lamble and Durnford.  A fine morning and the parade went off very well probably our last big one for sometime.  For lunch Kellaway had his brother with us.  A medical authority on the subject of meningitis.  During the afternoon made preparations for tomorrows work embodying the necessary cleaning up and cleaning out the packs of surplus gear.  Stewart, Greig and Blanchard all celebrate their birthdays today &amp; strange to say the two latter were also married on the same day of the year.

In some parts about there seems to be a good deal of poverty and old people beg .  Hereabouts everyone seems to have at least food and lodging but in Rouen it is different.  In Glasgow the bare poverty was more noticeable than anywhere else.
