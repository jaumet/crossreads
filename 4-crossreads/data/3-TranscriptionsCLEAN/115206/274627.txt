 Messines Gee but it has been cold today. I did old Garfortt's shift for him so therefore slept all day today. Waking only for meals. Wrote several letters. Executed the 8 to 12 pm midnight. Charlie Adey well stung. A bit of a stunt on at 7.15 pm a small barrage. Witnessed a perfect sunrise this morning dressed in a shirt and top boots.  Tom Codey waiting for leave pass to arrive.
