<p>However it was simply useless for if a shell burst anywhere close away they would go. Although pitying them the workers could not constrain themselves from laughing at their mad antics.</p>
<p>While this was happening the Major who had been wondering what had become of the men, came along, and seeing them all huddled up in the trench wanted to know, What [dash] [dash] they were doing there! What did it matter if two men were killed! What did they enlist for! Did they think their work was done! Certainly not! They would have again to go back to the dump &amp; bring back another load!</p>
<p>However while the officer was "roaring" at them a shell burst just beyond the trench, &amp; away the men went again not caring a straw for what the officer said or thought &amp; although he roared out, Are you a lot of women!, they simply kept going till stopped by another burst.</p>
<p>The workers then pointed out to the officer that as his men were so badly scared the best thing he could do would be to let them rest in the dug out for half an hour when probably things would be quieter. He agreed to do this.</p>
<p>Word was immediately passed to the Pioneers to go below. They did not care whether they knocked their heads on the roof of the stairs or not, or fell on the slippery parts, they only wanted to get below, &amp; they crushed down in twos &amp; threes instead of one at a time. They even wanted to rush down the shaft where the "workers" were working, but of course they were sent on to the other three shafts which all led into the same dug out.</p>
<p>After the half hours rest, they came up &amp; as the shelling had "gone away" to the left, they went out quickly &amp; quietly, to the dump to "bring in" their second load.</p>
<p>Arriving about 3 o'clock in the afternoon the two youngsters, among the workers, chaffed them unmercifully, but except looking as if they could knock the youngster's head off, they said nothing.</p>
