<p>Egypt<br/>6/2/16</p>
<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Well we have taken up a position for the present. We are somewhere out from the Canal &amp; on the desert It is all sand. At present the weather is beautiful. I am getting on tip top and feeling in as good health as ever I did. I hope you are all the same.<br/>We have now our reinforcements and are full strength again. I will tell you a little of the evacuation. I took over Stans post when they left. I only had three men, and had to stay for thirty six hours after they left Tell you how <strike>hellis</strike> ticklish it was our company left &amp; only 16 of us stayed it was the same all the way along<br/>They all left the Peninsular on the Saturday at six &amp; we left on Sunday night at one thirty I tell you if they had come we were gone to the mountains. I had 3 good men &amp; we would have died hard. I will tell you more when I get home. Will write again soon. Hoping you are all well With love &amp; kisses<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom.</p>
