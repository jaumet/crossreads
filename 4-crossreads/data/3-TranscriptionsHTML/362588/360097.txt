<p>Copy<br/>Australian Imperial Forces<br/>(Infantry Depot)<br/>Liverpool<br/>7th July 1915</p>
<p>Headquarters,<br/>2nd Military District.</p>
<p>Department of Defence No. 35103.</p>
<p>With regard to representations made to Headquarters regarding leave, I would point out that leave was not stopped entirely.  But as it appeared that Officers absented themselves without leave, and when they liked, - in the D.C.s instructions it was deemed advisable to stop leave, except with the approval of the Camp Commandant.</p>
<p>This step was rendered necessary by the fact that on several occasions I visited the various Battalions and I found on each visit not more than two Officers were present and these very junior.</p>
<p>Leave was never refused to any Officer who could show a legitimate reason, and as a matter of fact Officers were given leave for the purpose of sleeping in Liverpool and spending their evenings with their wives, but it is to be regretted that even this was abused.</p>
<p>As regards the order being resented as implying a want of confidence in Officers generally in their attention to duty in this respect, but that it was deemed necessary, after consultation with the D.C. to curtail leave in manner indicated, in the best interest of the Brigade.</p>
<p>Attached is forwarded copy of Routine Order 159 para. 3, June 8th 1915, dealing with the question of leave.</p>
<p>(Sgd) G.K. Kirkland<br/>Colonel<br/>Commandant, A.I.F. Camp</p>
