  
 We also heard another yarn the truth of which I wont vouch for - anyway it's [indecipherable] [indecipherable]   -  there are some 1700 souls on the Berrima & they are all male & all thirsty  -  Now a good deal of cash must of necessity find its way into the tills of the bar  -  This is collected & stored in safes  -  It is said it was found necessary to shift the safes - some to Port - some to Starboard - otherwise with all the cash on one side the Berrima had a marked list!!! 
 Well, well, the Captain & I got on to our launch  -  We had had a real good afternoon  -  Seen the Union Jack hoisted over New Britain seen some of the Empire's worthies Naval & Military  -  Had drunk some & talked some & I at least felt I'd had a very fine afternoon & was quite content with my first landing on the British isle of New Britain - recently taken over  - by act of war - from  Germany
