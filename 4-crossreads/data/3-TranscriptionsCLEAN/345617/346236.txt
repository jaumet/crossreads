Novembre 10Went to the Colliseum in afternoon & saw a good show with Mr & Mrs Smith. Afterward went to his sister's place in Isslington & spent a pleasant evening.
Novembre 11Went to Liverpoole with Mr & Mrs Smith to see Mr Smiths brother who was wounded at Hellfire Corner. He is doing very well. We had a rather rotten trip owing to a bad train service between Liverpoole & [indecipherable] & to the fact that we missed the tram coming home. Had an enjoyable day though.
