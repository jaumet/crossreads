 5.4.16 Wed 5th The natives killed a cow here for us today & it was rather interesting watching them.  they first cut its throat & then shoved a stick up the leg between the flesh & skin & put in about half an hour blowing air into it to make it skin easy, they were the whole morning doing it; Everything else the same as usual
