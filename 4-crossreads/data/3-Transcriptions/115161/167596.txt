<p>sure, you see, nature made me so short, my throat is so close to my stomach&quot;. I think he ordered me a number nine, the inevitable remedy for most ills. If a number nine failed to effect a quick cure, you could reckon that there was something wrong, (or as we used to say &quot;flurry crook&quot;.)</p>
