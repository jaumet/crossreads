<p>Thursday 25 March 1915</p>
<p>The work set down for to-day, was brigade manoeuvres and shortly before nine the 13th, 14th and 15th battalions left camp and cut across country, rushing through the sand at breakneck speed, as if their very lives depended on it.  The 16th had already taken up a strong position and at the first halt, the day's scheme was explained to us.  A White force, the 16th, is making an attack on Zeitoun, and a Brown force, the rest of the brigade, is sent out to oppose them.  The two forces engage, and the smaller party has to retire, for the purpose of reforming and regaining its <u>morale</u>.  The "Browns" immediately press home their advantage by a vigorous frontal attack combined with an outflanking movement.  The enemy are forced to take up a defensive position and hurriedly entrench.</p>
<p>But the cover was sufficent to protect them from the deadly rifle fire of a superior force, and so good a target did they present, that the umpires gave us the decision although at least four hundred yards from the leading trench.  The "cease fire" was sounded and we reformed.  After lunch (very stale bread and <u>sardines</u> of all luxuries) and a rest, we began our tramp back to camp along the old Suez road.  A fairly warm day, so the very cold water of the shower bath was very acceptable.</p>
