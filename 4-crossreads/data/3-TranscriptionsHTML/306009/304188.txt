<p>1915<br/>Jan. 2 Sat.<br/>Still feeling a bit off colour.<br/>Weather  still fine and sea calm.<br/>Usually sleep out on the deck with hammock as a ground sheet. Have only slept below first 2 nights on board.<br/>We got plenty of tucker but I very rarely have an appetite for it. Have gone right off meat, potatoes, coffee &amp; tea. The meat is sometimes, bad.</p>
