Thy are at present spending there honeymoon at Clovelly Court.  Diary May 8th.  Yesterday I went for a walk along the beautiful Hobby Drive which winds in and out on the hill side, it was lovely walking under the graceful spraying branches of the beech trees that are now unfolding their new tender green leaves - underneath them and on the banks are carpets of bells in colour from blue to varying purple with here and their clusters of the sweet scented yellow primrose.  The violets are there too but being scentless one is not drawn to them - the ferns and thick foliage help to make up the whole.  And I loved looking downwards through these tall shadowy trees and get glimpses of the calm blue sea below.  I payed the Gatekeeper -/6 this morning.
