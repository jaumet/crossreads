not sorry either, none to pleasant trudging along the sandy beats during the heat of the day.Each day becoming more & more monotonous, even the officers very discontented & anxious to leave this country.
Thursday 11/5/16Working on mess shed which is being constructed for the use of our unit.  Afternoon half holiday.   First time on sick parade since joining the 8th F. Amb; received a bump during the obstacle race on Anzac day & as in dozens of other cases here will not heal & has become septic.
