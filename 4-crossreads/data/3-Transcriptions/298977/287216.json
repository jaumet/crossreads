<p>and was very grateful for it later on.  It saved me from a nasty wound.  I also wrote to Joe at the same time thanking him, and that must have shared the same fate.  Yes, Ernie Lyons is in the Section.  A fine chap.  So Les Atkins has joined up.  That must be the finish of the old hands.  Was very pleased you put in for Os and I for a Memorial to Harold.  It was what I would have wished.  I wrote to the Rector last mail.  I often hear from him.  Apparently he is not forgetting his old boys.</p>
<p>Suppose you will have finished your spell by the time this gets home.  I hope it does you good and you have a good time.  You've evidently had a pretty rough time.</p>
<p>The report from the Comforts Committee was interesting.  They are certainly doing great work.</p>
<p>Had a letter this mail from Roy Fleming, from "Somewhere in  France" first I heard from him since leaving.  He is getting a Commission, so will have to be careful how I address him in future.  Rumours are getting very persistent about our going over his way, and I am beginning to believe there is something in them.  Hope so anyway.  May as well see a bit more of the world while I am at it, especially at the expense of the Government.</p>
<p>Will probably have a change in my address shortly, but will let you know definitely next week.  Will probably be H.Q. of Brigade.</p>
<p>I wonder if you ever sent me along a watch from home.  It's very awkward being without one.  If you haven't please do, preferably luminuous.</p>
<p>Well I guess I've done pretty well this mail and am quite exhausted with the effort, so will close.</p>
<p>Hope Mother and Dad are quite O.K.  Love to all and best wishes to friends round about.  Please thank Miss Wise very much for the soap.  As she says it was a very Wise choice.</p>
<p>Love from<br/>Roy.</p>
