25/12/18 Gourdinne
Awakened by the strains of our band playing Xmas carols. The snow of last night was still lying on the ground in patches but the day turned out finer later on. The day was observed as a close holiday. We are making a good many new improvements round the village. Our changing of the guard called out a big crowd again today. The people at my billet made me a present of a box of sweets signed a card with all their names on it. Went to A B Coy's dinners which were splendid. All the chaps were in great form. I made two speeches signed hundreds of autographs and then returned to my billet. The sound of roisterers going home gave the streets a merry ring. Everyone was in the very best of good humours tonight.
