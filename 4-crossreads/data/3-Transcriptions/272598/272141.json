<p>No 4 post.  Clear day for observation, any amount of shelling</p>
<p>Saturday 23.12.16<br/>Arose very early were relieved by 7th F.Amb. &amp; moved off to quarry dump where we entrained in open trucks in the rain about 9.30 AM, carrying 48 hours rations.  Moved away from quarry about 11.15 Am &amp; arrived at Mealte siding where we detrained at 1.30 pm.  Motors were waiting to convey us to our unit at Chateau d'Pliancourt" near Vignacourt; passed through Corbie &amp; Amiens enroute.  Very cold trip.  On arrival at Headquarters, much to my surprise, was informed that I had been mentioned in despatches (General Staff Orders, December 6th, 16) for good work in the field.</p>
