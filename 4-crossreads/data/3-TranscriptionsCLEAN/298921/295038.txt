  
 March, 1915 Saturday 6 You will think we are very gay & perhaps not serious enough when I tell you that we all went to another Ball at Continental Hotel - Dinner & danced till 4 A.m. being second night out without sleep - 1st in the trenches on the Desert, 2nd in electric lighted beautiful hall - but it all helps to keep a man fit, & the scene is a gay one, nearly all soldiers - expensive also!!! Friday night we Marched 18 miles & dug ourselves in  & awaited Infantry attack at dawn got back to Camp 9 A.m. Received letters from Aunt Louie Jan 22 & another from Laura Feb 19 - please thank them for me.
