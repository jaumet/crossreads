  
 Thursday 24th At 6 am a bathing party went to the pier  -  This was my only trip to-day  -  I remained on board & put in my time writing & reading  -  I have ascertained from the PM (Provost Marshall) that McGuire of the Medical Army Corps is PMO  -  He's temporary probably but at any rate there's no opening for me  - 
 Nothing doing & no news worth recording  -  A destroyer (Warrego) swept round our counter at sunset  -  What wicked little black hornets they look & are  -  Their black color - 2 stunted funnels well forward  -  They look to be dragging a long black body behind them  -  Amid ships is a torpedo - forward is a four inch gun  -  They can steam some 27 knots an hour & look like black snakes on the horizon - breathing smoke & threatening destruction  - 
 I mentioned we got a fresh prize - found up a creek & all covered up with green boughs - a fine little steamer  -  We got her niggers  to-day & coaled & then they cleaned our paint & holystoned
