<p>Fritz aeroplanes here all day now.  ours are never up when they are about<br/>of course they may be elsewhere</p>
<p>8/2/17<br/>I went down to get my back rubbed yesterday to Chalk Pit &amp; went through the old trench we left to come where we are now  well there is nothing left of it so to speak it is marvellous to see how things can be smashed up.  Fritz aeroplane very low firing his machine gun at our boys &amp; got a few , what is wrong with our [indecipherable] I do not know (I washed my feet they were awful)</p>
<p>Coming home three of us got a hot time with Fritz shelling us no doubt about it he is clever how on earth he could see us I do not know but we got a nice half hour.  three times we tried to pass.<br/>Our artillery is some thing damnable or was last night falling short etc knocked hell out of our boys &amp; trenches absolutely demoralised them it was a shame but our telephone would not work &amp; we could not stop them so we got it hot &amp; strong</p>
