Carry 3 times to Lee's Post for Pozieres. Knocked clear out. thoroughly exhaust Get budget of letters in dugout last night. What a read, & what a brief respite from the awful surroundings. Flies in dugout 3- black, sleepy crawly horrors satiated with offal, seek comparative quiet in the bowels of the earth. Concussion blows candle out repeatedly. Too tired to rest. Meet Tony in afternoon & have a good old yarn. Warwicks hop over this evening. Drizzly rain sets in again it makes the roads & saps well-nigh impassable. 6th F. Amb bearers come up to reinforce. a big stunt anticipated to night by our boys.
