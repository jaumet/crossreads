One on starboard side has 2 lighthouses &amp;  about 3 signalling stations. No trees or grass &amp;  no jetty or wharf. Travelled 295 miles. Natives came over to us from the shore selling tobacco, preserved fruit, post cards etc. Fired a blank off to frighten them away.

A clock is placed on a hill <strike>in the</strike> town &amp;  has only its [indecipherable]. Quite lonely it looks. It isn't lit up at night either. A very good search light is used by the garrison stationed there. Have a headache &amp;  sore chest.</p>
