<p>Visited several of the cafes &amp; tried their coffee 17 &amp; beer, 70.60 also had a game of billiards.  They were up to date with waiters etc.  Cinema shows were plentiful &amp; I went into one, entry free, inside being all tables at which beer etc was served.  There were plenty of young men about, the war treating Belgium lightly in this respect &amp; everyone looked happy &amp; prosperous.  All the coal mines in the vicinity appeared to be working, in fact all appeared to be normal except for the troops present, the greater number being Australian.  Notices such as "Welcome to our brave Allies", "to our liberators" etc were plentiful &amp; I noticed that America here as elsewhere comes in for praise out of all proportion, Woodrow Wilsons photo &amp; the Stars &amp; stripes being more prominent than anything English.  Slept in the car &amp; had a good night turning in about 10 &amp; having read by candlelight.</p>
