Dear Dad, Mum & George,
Yesterday was the 13th & we had our final orders issued to us to return our equipment & get ready to march out for Blighty & Home perhaps on the 15th.  So we are all standing by, Patients & all, & we send the first batch off at 9 am in the morning.  We will then be able to set the wires going for our return to Australia which we have not been able to do in France.  Ellis & Billy Hanrahan have gone for a stroll but I am attracted by a good orchestra which is playing here to-night & I will wait until the performance is over (the band gave me a start) before I rejoin them.  We are all in the gayest of spirits
