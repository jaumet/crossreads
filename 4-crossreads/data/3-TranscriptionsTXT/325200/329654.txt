 Romani Same time Next day 3rd November Arrived here today. It rained when we arrived so tonight I have rigged a diminutive tent composed of my canvas saddle cover  &amp;  some palm sticks supported at my head by my saddle. I am afraid it won't stand much but at any rate I am safely inside now writing by the light of a candle which threatens to blow out every minute. It has been thundering all the evening  &amp;  I am afraid we shall have a bad night.
