<p>83 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Up at 9.30 this morning had a good breakfast then started on our round of visits, first went to Odance  &amp; got everything fixed up there then went after our Xmas billies &amp; was lucky enough to get them &amp; 3 cases of gift stuff extra, sent them all on to Sohag, met Lt Rodgers at the Base this afternoon, he laid me on to a decent job so with half an ounce of luck I ought to get it, met Fatty Lloyd also, got all business fixed up by 5 &amp; went to tea with Smithy, had a bonza feed &amp; then gathered up our parcels &amp; strolled down to the train at 8, climbed aboard &amp; turned down for the night, arrived at Assuit at 3.30 found the camp dismantled &amp; turned in at 4 oclock tired out but happy.</p>

<p>Left Assuit  -  Arrived Sohag</p>
<p>Up again at 5.30 for the boys start on their trek at 8 this morning, we loaded the train by 10.30 &amp; then had to mess around until 3.30 when the train was due to leave, but when the train arrived half of our waggons were still on the platform so we caught the ordinary &amp; after a very dusty trip finally arrived in Sohag at 6.10, went up the town for tea &amp; then settled down to await the arrival of the troop-train, it put in an appearance at 1.30 meanwhile we were well nigh frozen, got our blankets &amp; went straight to sleep thoroughly tired out.</p>
