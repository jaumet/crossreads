94 wks of soldiering
Reveille as usual
Signal Stns were out all the morning good work was effected, went out for a ride in the afternoon later on went down to the Sig Sqd.
Reports are just as usual our troops met with every success on the last stunt although on one occasion when three sqds were deploying one mistook the direction in so doing allowed a patrol of the enemy to slip away, one only being captured, he being mounted on a slow camel.
More facts have come to hand concerning the doings of the yeomantry officers who were out at Duidae when surprised by the Turks surrendered without a fight well nigh on two sqds were cut up the 5th went out got em out of a scrape.
Lamp practice at night with Pards new pattent lamp which was real OK.
