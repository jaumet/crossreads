<p>My dear Moth. &amp;  Sisters</p>
<p>Received Ethel's also Nurse A's letters with Eddy's usual love letter, which I was more than delighted to receive. Am so pleased the darling got on so well   &amp;  trust he has improved in every way since. Hope you were all able to get a holiday this Xmas.</p>
<p>My, it is freezing. The frost has been very severe for days now, so all the snow is like rock   &amp;   the water</p>
