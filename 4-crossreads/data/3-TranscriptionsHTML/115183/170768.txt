<p>(3)<br/>I was taken on the strength of the Ninth F Amb as from Tuesday 31st October 1916. The next few days found me on parades and at stretcher drill, unloading and unloading wagons, and on route marches to the neighbouring villages and Stonehenge. These route marches were an unknown pleasure to me and designed to keep fit the men who were justly considered fully trained. I applied for the four days indulgence leave granted by the King after his review of our troops at Bulford. <br/>The leave with an additional day for travelling was granted from the Friday morning 3/11/16. Owing however to my dodging gargll parade that morning missed the pass till later in the day and caught the 12.34 pm train for Salisbury where after a walk round during the delay I caught a London train and arrived about 5 pm.</p>
<p>From Waterloo I walked round past the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abby and St Margaret's</p>
