<p>[The remainder of the page crossed through.]  On Reconnaissance had 1 horse shot. Turkswatch us, we watch Turks. Every afternoon <strike>about noon</strike> the wind rises &amp; clouds of dust blown from the North nearly as bad as a Riverina Dust storm. Shifted Camp last night back across the WADI. Our turn for the Trench having finished for a time.</p>
