captured the whole outfit with hardly any casualities. There were 35 Germans only been here three days. What a great trip they are having! From Germany through here and right round to Cairo. They would be pleased! Mother asked me in one of her letters for the address of Jim Ayre's mother, but I do not think either of his parents are alive. His old home in New South was Benduck, near Hay. They have started two newspapers over here which I am going to subscribe to and think I'll send them home as well. One is the KIORA-COOEE and A, & NZ paper issued monthly. I have read its first spasm and its jolly good. The other is the Palestine news and is for the whole army here. They both seem pretty good papers. There is most beautiful feed round here, and running water in every wadi - our early morning patrol to-day saw some gazells in along the foothills and there are wild flowers everywhere only they would be tame ones in Australia, because most of the wild flowers here are grown in the gardens at home. I must stop now. Love to Mother & Hal & Fred. That cake Mother sent was A1 and we eat it all along the treck from Bethlehem to Jericho. please thank mrs Sterling for her share in it. I am Your loving Son, Robert C Wilson
