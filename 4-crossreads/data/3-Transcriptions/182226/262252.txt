<p>Wednesday 18 August, 1915</p>
<p>Sailing through the Grecian Archipelego. The scenery was grand. The sunset today was a glorious sight. We are zigzaging all the way to safe guard us against submarines.</p>
<p>It is funny to see how the people on the islands build their houses right on the highest points of the hills. It must be a terrible walk to get up to them.</p>
