We got the loan of two gun and cartridg from Abdul the restaur keeper and in peac time , guid to tourist . He was a fine type of Arab , could speak sever languag , and was veri intellig . Along with Maham who went with us to rais the game we wander over Abdul crop . A few bird were rais but the excit of the moment and the fact we had not handl a gun for a long time we aim blind , or the bird was out of rang befor we had time to fire . We had almost given up hope of bring down ani game when S. by a chanc shot hit one a short distanc away . In our endeavour to secur the bind we wander into somebodi els 's ground and a nativ woman came out and shout all sort of thing in her nativ tongu at us . Moham know what she said we did ?nt , but one could gather from her gesticul and excit manner that their was troubl brew for us if we went much further . We got the bird and return home .
