  
 [Letterhead: The Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, Sydney, N.S.W.] To. State I have worked with Sister E.S. Thistlethwaite at home & abroad &  have been kept in touch with her work for a considerable number of years. With assurance I can recommend her as capable of carrying out any nursing duties entrusted to her, either those of administration or care of patients.
