 Dear Mrs. John, 
 I missed last mail, I'm sorry & I hope you weren't feeling too vexed, it seems ages since I wrote a decent letter to you but  really  its really very hard here to write.  I'm going hard from getting up to going to bed & the latter is anything from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m.  Interruptions are the rule and at times young Strath Playfair (who is Adjutant here & my Boss) is very trying.  You can imagine how at times I just ache to pick him up & spank him.  He's an amusing youth, do you
