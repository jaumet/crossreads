<p>Sept<br/>had our packs up &amp; it was quite a hot morning. The roads are very good for marching but a bit hard. In many places they are only just wide enough in many places to march in fours. That is supposed to be 10 ft. Had a very large dinner &amp; then went for a walk with Baker about 3 miles extra for fun</p>

<p>Monday 17th<br/>Picked for Guard today &amp; had a very easy job going through Guard duities all day. Was chosen as best dressed man when the Guard was mounted so got off quite pleased as it is a wet night.</p>
