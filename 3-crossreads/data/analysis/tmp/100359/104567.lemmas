 Monday June 26th Our First Anniversari . A French offic met us all at the station and conduct us to our billet . We have about a dozen hut for our Amb . They are built in a nice littl paddock next to the kiddi school , and quit near a Church . There is a pond close by , which suppli us with water for wash , but it is not good drink water . We are onli a few mile from the fire line , and can hear the big gun quit distinct . It did not take us long to unrol our blanket and get to sleep , as we had been near 3 day on the train , and had veri littl sleep. We woke up again about 11 , and after a drink of tea and a snack we were told off in a fatigu parti to squar up the camp , and build latrin , etc. , Mac Dougal and I were told off as S.P. again , so the game is still good . We got leav when the work was done , and wander around the villag . It is onli a small place , but everi littl thing about it is histor . The French peopl are most oblig , noth is too much troubl to them . It is veri nice to talk to those who can speak English , as the French accent make one dri old lingo which sound quit pleasant . The town is full of soldier , Aust . N.Zealand , Tommi , Scotchmen , in their kilt , in fact , all sort , but they are all veri well behav . Everyth is veri cheap , , we onli have to pay about a penni here , for what those sob Egyptian would charg 6d . A parti of us went around the place and spent a most enjoy even . There were 6 of us in the parti and it seem strang to be abl to " shout " for the lot with onli 6 penc . There are a big number of wine and beer shop about , which did good busi , but I ve onli seen 1 man drunk . They do n't have to pay for licenc and anyon can open a shop , the onli restrict be a matter of hour . They are allow to open from 11 till 1 and from 6 till 8 in the even .
