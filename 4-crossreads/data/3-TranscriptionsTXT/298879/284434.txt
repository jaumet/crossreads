 September 1915 Thursday 9 Had a safe trip to Mudross Harbor. Lovely breeze. A number of warships are here. We landed about 2 PM. We had to walk about 2 &frac12;  miles and cross the sea in shallow water for about 400 yds before finally arriving at our camp. We were lectured by our new Col. (Cass) and then dismissed to good tents. 
 Friday 10 The Col. read an address from the Gen. Officer Com. the Med. Exp Force thanking us for the work we had done and and commending us on the heroic and successful way we took Lone Pine on the right of our position.
