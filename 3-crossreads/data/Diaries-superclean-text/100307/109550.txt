Paris
6/3/17
the tombs were comfortable upholstered chairs I suppose for any members of family who might visit the ancestral grave and care for a sit down. Set out once more and after a long walk reached the Buttes Chaumont which a fine garden in the centre of which is a temple but the military are in charge and admission barred. Had rather a trouble in finding this park and had to traverse low and squalid streets. A little dirty simple soldat "sur permission" shook hands heartily and brought in a spirit sodden female to aid in indicating the way. 
Into the Rue de Manin to a cafe and had cafe au lait and whips of bread and butter for 1f. 50 cms plus the inevitable 2 sous pourboire for the waiter. hailed a taxi and he drove me right to the Bourse for 1/1. Travelling is nothing like as dear as in London. Pulled up at the Bourse which is modelled on the Temple of Vespasian and ascended the steps and watched an animated buying and selling accompanied by much noise and yelling. Did not go inside but walked right down to Lloyds Bank near
