Friday June 16th
The 14th Brig. Marched into our old camp with their "Circus" Bands we have our packs ready and gear all ready to move off at a minutes notice. Issued with Emergency Rations and waiting for the word "GO". The cookhouse are dismantled and their gear packed, so we have to exist on bully beef and bread and jam. Fell in about 6.30 for roll call and inspection. Then we had a drink of tea. This tea caused quite a lot of rude remarks to be passed. Capt. Wooster went to a lot of trouble to obtain sugar for the tea, but the cooks "lost it" After a lot of fooling around we marched to the station and got aboard the open trucks which were to take us to Alexandria. We left Moaska about 11 p.m. It was a glorious night and warm 
and the open trucks were much more pleasant than the closed in carriages would have been. We took our coats from our packs and rolling them around us dropped off to sleep.
