<p>Fine &amp; sunny. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>all day. We had to turn out at</p>
<p>6.30 pm &amp; go down to the old 27<sup>th</sup></p>
<p>position in &quot;Houplines&quot; &amp; draw</p>
<p>ammunition and take it to</p>
<p>our right section &amp; then get</p>
<p>another load &amp; take it to the</p>
<p>centre section. Got back at 3 AM</p>
<p>Saw a very smart bit of work</p>
<p>at the waggon lines in afternoon.</p>
<p>a Hun plane got into a cloud</p>
<p>coming over our way &amp; hung</p>
<p>in it till he got over our</p>
<p>stables, &amp; then he dived out</p>
<p>&amp; went for an observation</p>
<p>balloon closw bye with his</p>
<p>machine gun. He missed</p>
<p>it first go &amp; came back again</p>
<p>but missed it again. The</p>
<p>men came down in parachutes</p>
<p>&amp; landed in our gun park.</p>
<p>he was only about 700 ft up</p>
