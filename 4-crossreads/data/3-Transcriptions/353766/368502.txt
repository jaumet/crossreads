<p>passed a lifebuoy, - some say two &ndash; marked S.M.S. Scharnhorst. It was not observed from the   <strike>ship</strike> bridge &amp; we were soon too far ahead to pick it up. Everybody sorry. Cornwall &amp; Otranto here, latter a warship grey. Interesting to pick up details of the fight of only twenty days ago.   <strike>"Indomitable" </strike> Inflexible &amp; Invincible coaling. Canopas on mud repairing boilers disguised to certain extent. Here were also Kent, Carnarvon, Glasgow, Bristol. Enemy reconnoitred with intention of hoisting German colours &amp; utilising Falklands as coaling base. Had with them transport (Seydlitz) of 2000 troops probably reservists who sneaked on board in S.A. ports. Saw small ships only. Came on boldly. Then saw tripod masts. Not good enough, turned to flee.  Canopas fired, hit Scharnhorst. Inflex &amp; Invinc. cast off colliers, pursue, open fire 18000 yards. All lyddite. Unable to see effect of shells which burst inside Gneisenau &amp; awful havoc before British can be certain she was hit at all. Picked up 130 survivors of Gneise. Sad story of Leipsic. Pursued by Glasgow &amp; etc. All guns out of action. Will not, or cannot, for some reason, strike colours. Glasgow ceases fire. Captain Leipsic gathered ships company on Q. Deck. Told them to smoke. Nothing more to be done. Unfortunately explosion</p>
