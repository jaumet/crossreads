  
 July 31st. Mon. C.N. and myself went for a stroll over the fields. We got out at the Grand Bois (Big Wood) and landed into a little cottage and had coffee and a chat in broken French with Madame and daughters. I became quite taken on with Marguerite and so she seemed with me but being R.C. from the many signs of the cross I saw her make, made one shy off. 
 After having coffee we made our way round by Neuf Berquin. The church in this place like the rest of the churches near the line was very badly damaged. 
 August 2nd. Wed. C.N. and I took a walk out by the "Petit Bois" and round by the "Grand Bois" to the place that we had visited two or three days ago. 
 We were invited in to have coffee again and we caused a great deal of merriment amongst them by our endeavour to speak "Francais". Old Madame was busying herself about the home, which although to outward appearance it was dilapidated looking, inside the home was very nice and very clean. Marguerite was sitting at the window sewing a dress. The other sisters were all out in the fields working. 
 I learn from Madame Cuzlet that this family, who all consider to be fairly well off, had been driven from their home, a farm near La Basser
