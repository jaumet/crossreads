When marching at night any obstacle is passed back to those in rear to keep them wary. Our tired chaps tottering along the road towards camp one night. One - nearly done was muttering all the time. "Mind the wire, mind the wire!" - the b-wire was round his own feet and he had been dragging it for miles.Bob Smith to a Colonel:- Take your - mob to - out of this."Col:- I beg your pardon Sir.BS- Take your - rabble to - out of this and b-b-h someone else's show. Is that plain!!!A funny sound like a joke out of eternity
