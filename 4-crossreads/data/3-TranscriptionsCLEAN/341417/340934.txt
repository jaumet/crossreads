  
 I carry your gum leaf and card with tobacco in it in my pocket for luck and I have also got the little Black cat yet that you sent me. 
 Well dear Miss King I hope you will excuse my short and scribbled letter as I am writing it under very trying conditions (front [dash]) so you will understand. 
 Thanks so much for your kindness to me I shall never forget you. Yours Very Sincerely Lance/Cpl R. Otto C Coy 2nd Battalion AIF France Kind Regards to all the women and girls in Sydney who is working for us.
