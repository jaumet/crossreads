So pleased that poor old Annie was able to have a few days in Melb. with you, dear old Belle would be very delighted.  I must finish my p. cards now so must stop.  The mail we believe leaves to-morrow.
Darling Eddy is getting quite clever with his drawing & writing.
Hope you are all well.  Fondest love & kisses to you all.  Hope Belle have A Happy Birthday.
Tell dear old Mother I'm still looking for her letter.
From,Your loving sister,Edith.
