Australian Imperial Force4/11/1918Dear Sis,Am enclosing card (photo) just to let you know I am O.K. again. I am not going to write a long letter as I must surely get one from you. I cannot understand Vol enlisting at all. I am going on my fourteen days furlough on Wednesday but it is awful weather, raining blowing as hard as can be. It has been like it nearly a week. The other boy is Teddie Gale from Blacktown. He is waiting to go home. I have a good job now on the massage staff will not be going PTO
