Our horses had no water from 2PM on the 18th till 2 oclock this morning as we are afraid of the wells being poisoned. 
 21-4-17 Sat 21st Heavy dew & very cold last night but I slept well & am feeling fit again today; We have Observation Posts out & getting plenty of visual work, as the Observation Posts are in sight of the enemy; Our horses went to water a troop at the time this morning
