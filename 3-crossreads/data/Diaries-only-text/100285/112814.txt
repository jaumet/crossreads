While I was working on my lists last night a runner came along enquiring for Sgt Barwick, I was busily engaged at the time I blessed him, it appears he came from Lieut Gribble, I wondered what on earth he could be wanting, I soon found out when I looked at the sprawling spidery writing, wanted me to Lend him a few shillings for a few days, he was as drunk as a lord one could easily see that by the writing, booze was what he wanted it for, he got nothing off me, I told him I was broke that if he called round in a few days time I would see what I could do for him, that's what drink does for a man, I feel sorry for Jack at one time he was one of the straightest men in the Force, never drank swore or had anything to do with women, now
