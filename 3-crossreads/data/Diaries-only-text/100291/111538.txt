The wind dropped completely last night. a heavy fall of snow lay on the ground by morning, so soft lightly it fell. No one had any idea it had settled.
A brilliant morning for a few hours soon overclouded intermittent snow again all day. 
Thirty 2nd Field bearers arrived yesterday to release the 4th Field Bearers who have been here for 3 weeks are going to Bapaume this morning. I suppose when the 1st Div, goes in again it will be our turn to "impati".
