1916   SUNDAY 8   OCTOBER
Fine again. One of the fellows in the hut got the measles in the morning & we were all put in quarintine, but like most other military things its a farce. The 7th Brigade played the [?] 3rd Infantry officers & we beat them very easily. Poss Nivison & self & Jack went the pictures in evening & they were rotten.
