Dear Mick
I have accomplished the whole day without painting and I feel quite important.  The boys may be interested to learn that I determined early this morning to rest or rather loaf about like a schoolboy on the first day of the holidays without a set programme of enjoyment.  The net result is a strong bench put up in my studio tent, a swell clothes stand & boot shelf in the sleeping marquee, last & not too dusty a very elaborate Jackal trap, so complicated and at the present untried stage so efficient-looking that our Sergeant suggested that notice boards be put up in the surrounding gullies inviting or directing enterprising Jacks to come in & have a treat.
Tim who I hope is quite alright, may be interested in the appended design.  If no luck tonight we intend transplanting * Anemones, Crocus, and other wild flowers to give the trap a homely & encouraging appearance.
