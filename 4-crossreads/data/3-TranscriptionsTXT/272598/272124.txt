 in a dug-out for two nights without a wink of sleep. 
 Thursday 2.11.16 Large sick parade, only 8 of our section left including myself.  Have heavy cold &amp; slight trench feet but stuck it out.  Went out again to the posts, but work getting harder each day.   Quite a common occurrence to get stuck in the mud while carrying a stretcher.  Received a few letters prior to leaving camp but owing to heavy work from the time we took over post from 15th F Amb, was unable to read them till late at night.   Expect to be relieved by a second division amb to-morrow.  Five of 15 F Amb wounded by shrapnel a few minutes after we relieved them.
