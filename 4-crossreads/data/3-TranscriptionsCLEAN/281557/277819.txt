  
 attended physical drill class after tea 
 Thursday Jan 6th A very calm day : hot : Revellie 6 am : mess orderly all day : had my wrist painted & it is a lot better : our Coy on guard so we had no after tea physical drill class. This made our second time on guard since coming on board. Boxing tournament continued & more willing bouts : slept on deck but rained toward midnight & got damp a bit : but that is better than being packed
