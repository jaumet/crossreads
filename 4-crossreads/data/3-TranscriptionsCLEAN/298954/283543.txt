  
 The after-well deck (chiefly planter's apprentices, minor civil servants etc) is clinging to the outer semblances of civilisation to the last and still looks with horror at the sun-burnt semi-nudity on the poop. 
 This grim disapproval affected me to such an extent that I attired myself in a once-white tennis shirt and a pair of shoes in addition to the usual "shorts" when I visited the "well" to sit among the Highly Respectable and to munch crab-sandwiches with Webbie and Kennedy under the torpedo-tube this evening.    Smithy quite blossomed out;   he sailed out to meet Mrs Flood in an elaborate tennis negligee and a borrowed white topee!   That lady, by some mysterious means, still appears in well-laundered whites resting usually on a foundation of cerise or emerald silk hose. 
 An admiring train usually follows bearing cushions, etc. (not forgetting the purple brolly.)    In comparison with the other female-prisoners she looks quite brilliant.   (The others are mostly "primly-respectable".
