only seen land three times since leaving Alex,  that was Crete, Cape Bon in Tripoli and the Sardinian Coast.
We have the whole Brigade aboard here, with our horses, besides various details of ASC & AMC etc, about 900 men all told.
We had a parade of the whole 4th Division just before leaving Serapeum for the C in C, Sir Archibald Murray. it was a fine sight - The Artillery marched past mounted, and I know there was one very proud as we swung past the Saluting Base. It is very gratifying to see the progress our gunners have made since we took them in hand at the beginning of March
