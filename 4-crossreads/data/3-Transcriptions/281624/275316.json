<p>Sunday 12th March  My busy day dispensing all morning did sick parade myself, Dr out for day and I let my assistant go.  In p m wrote an article for London Daily Mail, called Anzacs &ndash; The Unconventionables.</p>
<p>Monday 13th March  More troops have gone to France, but we do not know our intentions we have not even got our horses yet.  Went into Cairo for a walk round in<br/>p m.</p>
<p>Tuesday 14th March  Ceremonial Parades every day there is a rumour gaining currency that the regiment is going to England.  Now that they have up to the 64th Batt they are making  a lot of new Artillery Brigades and are building them up out of the Detail Camps of LH.</p>
<p>Wednesday 15th March  Dispensing Day.  My transfer has at last arrived and in the night orders I was read out as [indecipherable] to be Corporal to Lance Sergeant.  So after 20 months service I have my confirmed rank.  I received a great ovation from the mess when I entered.  Went to O'Rs at night.</p>
<p>Thursday 16th March  It has cost me something to christen my confirmed stripes and there was a celebration by my fellow sergeants at the mess. I am proud of my rank now as I know I have had a hard fight for them with all previous luck against me.</p>
<p>Friday 17th March  For the past week I have had a brutal cold that has been causing a lot of trouble.  It is the worst I have ever had, medicines wont break it and it leaves me gasping for breath.</p>
<p>Saturday 18th March.   I believe the 2nd Division has gone to France and if so my brother Harold has gone with the 6th F Amb.  I have not heard a word from my other brother.  I fully expect to see Peace declared in a few months as all the Central Powers seem to be weakening.  Nearly all the LH Details have transferred to the new Artillery Brigades and I had an excellent chance of receiving a commission had I applied.  In pm went to Bulac to see the big football match between England &amp; Scotland.  The former winning.</p>
