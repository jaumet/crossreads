 Aus. Aux. Hospital Southall, Middlesex England 8.12.16 
 I hav'nt heard of you for quite ages dear Lady, quite intended scribbling a few lines of greeting to be in time for Xmas but really there is so little time.  I am up to my eyes in work at the Red X Store of the above Hospital and seldom leave much before six often after and by the time Home letters &amp; Mer's are written each week I'm so tired I don't get many others written.  Am wondering where our letters are, your last which I answered months ago said you had written several which certainly had'nt come to hand, probably my reply has never reached you. I hav'nt heard a word about your brother for a long time.  Mer. has'nt managed to strike him in France. I live in a little cottage near the Hospital, a very quiet and distinctly lovely life, &amp; at times get desparately Son-Sick &amp; Home-sick but I'm so thankful to have plenty of work,
