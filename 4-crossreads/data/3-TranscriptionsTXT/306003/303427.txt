14-7-16went down to the water troughs in the palms to get four pieces of angle iron for corner posts for the stadium   found they had all been used, but managed to get four pieces of timber from Bde H.Q. this afternoon & put them up after tea;  Now that James has gone down to it, I have to arrange for anything we require & am kept going constantly;
Tonight I went to James' tent to help arrange the contests for tomorrow night & found neither the 2nd or 3rd had given any names in so it had to be postponed till the morrow;  Our Regt. Sgt. Major (James) has been off color for some time & today went down to it at the latrines & had to be carried back to the tent on a stretcher, he has gastritis, the Adj advised him not to go away sick as there is a vacancy for him with a promotion to Lieutant;  McKeowan is acting RSM.
