  
 We had 2 hours on Hazebruck & then came on to Etaples - the Base, where I had to stay the night.  There was an unusual rush of officers so it was difficult to get accommodation.  I slept in a small hut on the floor.  I was given one blanket, but managed to get another. Was up at 6 & caught the train at 7.30.  I did not know where the 1st Bde. was, I simply went on to the Station indicated on the pass which was Albert & there I found they were out about 4 miles.  Albert is or has been a good town but is badly knocked about.  The fine cathedral is terribly battered and the tower still stands though very shaky.  On the top there was once a huge figure, I suppose 20 feet or more high, of the Madonna holding in her hands towards heaven a baby, the holy child.  It is of bronze & gilt.  This had been hit at the base and now hangs head
