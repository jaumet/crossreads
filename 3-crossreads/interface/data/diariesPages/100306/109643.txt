2/1/17 Thistle Tr 
where we found the 6th Dorsets. As soon as one put head inside the dugout a scent of perfumed soap met the nostrils. Not the war-weary warriors we are. There was an Artillery officer there and a young Dr. good lookers both. Our doctor, Fraser, again 101 and will have to go sick tomorrow. Relief complete by 9 pm. Two new telephone lines laid and they work satisfactorily. A fairly quiet evening as far as strafe goes. The relief went well and mud was not too bad and our ration parties got to work at once to carry the stuff up. This dugout is a Hun one and very neatly built all wooden pieces and much neater than the British type is. Table with telephone at foot of first flight and then recess holding spring bed. Down one more flight and there is a corridor with the signal office and the batmen. Stayed up all night busy with orders and ?phone. Rumours ? that Smith, Forbes, Plant have each got D.S.O. and that Austria is suing for a separate peace. Some furphy, what! A quiet night.
