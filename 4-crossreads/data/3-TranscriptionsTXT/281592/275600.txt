 At these stations, sidings made by widening the canal are placed so that vessels can pass one another.  One of the vessels has to moor to the side till the other passes.  Ships of War and Mail Boats fly the privilege flag and are allowed to pass first (a white P on a blue ground).  Various signals to regulate the traffic are in operation.  Speed limit 6 miles per hour. 
 The first stage of interest after leaving Suez with Mt. Attaka as a back ground (2700 ft) is the Bitter Lake in which the speed is increased to full beteen the stations Serapeum and Toussoum. 
 Then Ismailia on Lake Timsah which lies midway of the length of the canal. 
 A narrow gauge railway runs from Ismailia along the bank to Port Said.  A railway also runs to Cairo. 
 After 17 miles of narrow canal and high sandy banks at Kantasah the famous crossing of the caravans and pilgrims to Mecca is passed.  (Mecca is about half way down the Red Sea on the Arabian side.)  Lake Minzalah with its flamingoes and wild fowl are located on the west side and passengers on ships will often on occasion see a mirage.  Cairo has frequently been seen pictured upside down in the air, so also have ships etc. 
 The run through the canal takes from 15 to 17 hours.
