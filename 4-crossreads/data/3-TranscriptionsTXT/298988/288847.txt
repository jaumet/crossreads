What a surprise the Turks are going to get &amp; by pretty authentic accounts there are also 40,000 Germans there too. The "Queen Elizabeth" is here just at present but I suppose she will get away with the other Battleships so as to arrive there before daylight.

While we are landing, Battleships from behind us, will be bombarding the Turks, but the trouble is that the enemy have concealed guns everywhere.
