<p>7th September:- Thursday<br/>A beautiful day &amp; I pay a visit to the doctor, just to let him know I'm alive    &amp; also to keep up my case of getting away. Am not feeling too well. The doctor is undoubtedly a little mad &amp;  carries on. At last word comes from the front &amp; instead of success, am informed by Capt Parker that there is no vacancy on any of the units written to &amp; must carry on here. Defeated now at every turn I take of trying to get to the front &amp; here is my last hope. More than disappointing &amp; I'll do no work here. I <strike>wont</strike> carry on for any of them. A man is chaffed at from home    &amp; no man in the army has tried more than I to do my share in the proper place. If they don't want me they will not get me in future &amp; I'll go to Australia next chance</p>
