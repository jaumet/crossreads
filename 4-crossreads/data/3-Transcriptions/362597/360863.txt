<p>not allowed to lay a hand on a Corporal &amp; it is a crime to put a Corporal in the cell.</p>
<p>I had to go before the 2nd in command &amp; things were pretty soon fixed up. The 2nd in command almost asked me to let the matter drop because the guard &ndash; he was a sergeant &ndash; &amp; if I had pressed the case would have lost his 3 strips. Anyway he got a blowing up from the adjutant. It was quite an experience &amp; caused a great amount of fun.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12.1.16 (21)<br/>A hell of a hustle today. At 9.30 the 5 sirens went, which is the signal, stand to the boats.</p>
