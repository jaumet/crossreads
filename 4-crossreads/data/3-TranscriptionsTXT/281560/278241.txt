25/4/16.Anzac Day. The Brigade marched out to a square field enclosed on three sides by pine woods; and there a memorial service was conducted. A very large number of our fellows were an parade there; a the whole parade gave the Royal Salute to the Memory of the Australian Dead. It was a very impressive ceremony. 26/4/16.There was a zeppelin raid on this base last night. The raider dropped nine large bombs, no damage was done; but a few casualities and large holes blown in the ground. One bomb fell about 150 yards away but failed to explode. I hopped out of my tent when I heard the racket and saw the "Zep" flying at an immense height. It disappeared straight away.
