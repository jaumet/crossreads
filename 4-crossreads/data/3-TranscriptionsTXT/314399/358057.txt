Saturday 1 March 1919Went to Eaton Place to see about work but couldn't get any. Have made an appointment with the Studebaker people for Monday. Took Marie & Janet to see the King review The Young Guards & then to the football match at Fulham. Fulham played Chelsea & won easily 6 to 2. There was a tremendous crowd at both shows.
McGowan came out to dinner. His right wing is still sore & won't be right for some time. Took Janet to see the Naughty Wife. Gladys Cooper is the lead. It was excellent. Gladys Cooper had a broken arm & still played. Enjoyed it immensely.
Sunday 2 March 1919Up at 1.30 for lunch. Bonny day too. Wrote a couple of letters & then met Janet & we wandered round St James, Hyde & Regent Parks. Had tea at Marie's. She was out & had dinner at Pagani's in Gt. Portland Street & then back to Marie's. She was home then. Janet has a job as a V.A,D for Marie.
