<p>1915<br/>Jan. 16 Sat.<br/>Went on leave ashore at 10.30 a.m. &ndash; Had watch mended &ndash; dinner at the Soldiers &amp; Sailors' Home &ndash; Haircut at a French place  - Went out to Ibrehimieh &amp; visited Rev. Fry, Scout Secretary for Alexandra, found him very decent, took me along to see his boys, nice lot of fellows. There are British, Italian, Greek, &amp; Jewish Scouts in Alexandria. &ndash; Got lost coming back to wharf, did tremendous lot of walking &amp; at last reached destination &ndash; taken aboard quickly on an Egyptian boat at 5 p.m.<br/>Heard that disembarkation of the Unit was to commence the following day. What rotten luck being dumped in Egypt instead of going on to Europe.</p>
