  
 Some dated 1st may and some 16. Got letter from mother yesterday dates March 21st. No intermediate ones and none from  Her . Gas alarm sounded - probably we are using it. Very little wind. Another attack apparently at La Bassee. Fritz using a searchlight a little 4 balloons came up again to-day. Writing this while waiting at gas alarm. German observation balloon hurriedly pulled down on the appearance of our aeroplanes. Another gas alarm later on and when we went out to see what was happening a machine gun bullet "phutted" about 3 yards from us. We quickly got inside and after waiting about an hour had a snooze till dawn. 2.7.16 There was a big bombardment all night and we learnt we had made important advances all along the line. Our artillery did very excellent work and the german trenches 1st 2nd & 3rd were smashed to atoms as well as their barbed wire entanglements. Worked hard all day and we had a new infantry party who worked beautifully for us and thought they were on a picnic instead of fatigue. About 3.30 the leave men turned up with news that we were to return to Sailly in the evening so we at once gathered up our tools and put things straight and cleaned ourselves. Considerable Taube activity to-day over us and after tea we had a Taube right over us and guns firing at it. We heard a whizz and a thud quite close to our dug out and first thought it was an unexploded shell but it was a nose cap from one of our shrapnel shells and gave us a bit of a turn. Started to walk at 10 to 7 (about 5 miles) our bags going on the transport we had several beers on the road and a very hilarious time and I enjoyed it muchly. However took only a very little. Arrived about 10 o'clock and went up to our old billets and laid on the floor till our blankets arrived. Very dusty and several of our boys were very pushed and we made a great row. Things were very amusing. Our blankets arrived but it was 2 in the morning before we could possibly think of sleep and then it was a very troubled one. Got a fine batch of 16 letters and these helped to keep us awake. 3.7.16 had to turn out at 6 o'clock and after a scurried breakfast and got our things together and after a bit of a fuss were allowed to put our heavy bags on the wagons. We were uncertain  we were uncertain  whether our section would go or not but now it seems we are to go with the mob for a rest. Opinions differing as to Merris, Strazeel or Steenwerck. We had squad drive from 1 to 2 very amusing and almost a disturbance as several were badly drunk. Supposed to be a check parade at 3 but it didn't come off and after tea I went to bed early and had a long sleep but I felt crawlers over me several times but no bites
