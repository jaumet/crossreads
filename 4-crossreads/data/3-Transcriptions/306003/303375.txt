We have never seen an enemy plane here &amp; thought it was our own plane returning after an early morning fly scouting, but one glance at her dove tail convinced me she was a Taube &amp; was out for revenge &amp; there was a rush to get our horses away from the horse lines, &amp; it was remarkable how soon they were clear &amp; we were scattering out onto the desert;</p>
<p>The early morning sun showed out every mark on the Taube soon after she was sighted &amp; gave us fair warning;  our anti-aircraft gun opened fire on her just as she was coming over our camp, but she was much too high to hope to hurt her.  the first bomb dropped within a few feet of the wireless plant, the second in Brigade Head Quarters, the third in the horse lines of the 2nd &amp; 3rd Regt. who suffered heavily in horse flesh as they did not take their horses off the lines;  The fourth &amp; fifth were dropped amongst our best horses</p>
