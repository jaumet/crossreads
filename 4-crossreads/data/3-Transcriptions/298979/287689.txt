<p>the 3rd Division had been kept in England ostensibly for drill purposes, for six months whereas the men from the 1st 2nd 4th &amp; 5th Divs were being sent back to France the second time, although the 3rd Div continually boasted that they were the finest equipped &amp; best drilled of all the Australian Divisions. However after about a week the Third Division men were removed elsewhere. One man of this 3rd Div who was taken to the Hospital with his throat cut, was reported to have killed himself on account of the invective hurled at him by those, in the same hut, who had already been wounded in France. Whatever the cause the man "suddenly left by the razor route" &amp; he belonged to the 3rd Div.</p>
<p>Medical examinations were made at least once a week &amp; according to the improvement made in each case were moved up a grade till at last the "move" to Z Class meant going across the road, where the "move" to France was only a matter of days.</p>
<p>At the first examination where 100 men were placed in a hut on account of the very cold weather, each man having to strip for Doctors inspection, the Sentry was marked A Class, the highest class in that Camp.</p>
<p>Being utterly astounded the Sentry could not help but angrily turn to the Doctor to say Why man! I cannot move my arm above my shoulder! How can I carry a rifle or even do physical drill with an arm in this state?<br/>The Doctor replied The wound is healed! &amp; turning to the clerk simply said, A Class!<br/>I tell you my arm cannot be raised above the shoulder although the wound is healed! said the Sentry.<br/>Take off your shirt &amp; let me see the arm! Keep the arm out straight<br/>Then turning to the next man, &amp; also another, &amp; having stood up apparently to look at the third, the Doctor suddenly put his whole strength under the Sentry's outstretched arm and raised it alright, but not without raising the Sentry's body also.</p>
<p>Every man of that 100 saw that it</p>
