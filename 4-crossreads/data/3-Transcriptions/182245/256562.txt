<p>FEBRUARY 1917</p>
<p>16 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; dull all day, but came on a</p>
<p>bit showery at night. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all morning &amp; out</p>
<p>exercising in afternoon. They</p>
<p>are starting to fool round</p>
<p>again &amp; make everything for show.</p>
<p>We have to wear gas masks</p>
<p>bandoliers ect out exercising</p>
<p>now. They are hurling the Tommies</p>
<p>down our throat at all possible</p>
<p>occasions; the Tommies do this</p>
<p>&amp; the Tommies do that so why</p>
<p>dont you do it. I never want</p>
<p>to see a pommie after the war.</p>
<p>The battery was called out about</p>
<p>7 pm to take up ammunition</p>
<p>&amp; we were fooling about. I did</p>
<p>not get back till 3 AM. Nobody</p>
<p>seemed to know anything about</p>
<p>the stuff, &amp; when we got unloaded</p>
<p>nobody knew were we were to</p>
<p>load again.</p>
