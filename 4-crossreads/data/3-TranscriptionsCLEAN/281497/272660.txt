poor Bill Carey had been killed he used to belong to our old Company H, & the night of the charge at Pozeries, he left the Pioneer Battalion, & joined in the charge with us, the day after we went out he was skittled.
This afternoon we were out on a route march with full packs up it is punishment for the number of drunks that have been about & to punish the few, they punish the whole lot; thats a bad point I reckon in the military, to make the many suffer for the few but they did not take us far, & we marched without Tunics, so we were not so badly off
