<p>different messes buying goods, alongside us are the Welsh Fusiliers and they have a great mess, they are mostly big lion hearted Wesh  miners, and a very jolly crew, they had a stadium and a boxing match in p.m., at which two of our chaps beat two of theirs, we had a celebration afterwards.</p>
<p>Teusday 24th Oct.<br/>Mail in, mine has gone to Ferry Post, will be over to-morrow, rode to El-Ferdan Rly. for more goods, did not return till late, our officers of this  [indecipherable]  the reserve regt. camped close handy, challenged a team for shooting, our chaps went up and got beaten by three pots.</p>
<p>Wednesday 25th Oct.<br/>Had a good rest, things now fairly well settled.  Mail in, none for me, mine out with regt.</p>
<p>Thursday 26th<br/>Gave a horse to Welsh Sgt. Major and we rode to El-Ferdan on the Canal we called at the Hereford &amp; other messes and then had good time with R.T.O., a good sport ordered all our goods for the merchants, then came<br/><name="a6472028"></a></p>
<p>[Page 28]<br/>home, it took two hours for us to cross canal.  First time S.M. rode a horse, he was not sorry to get off.</p>
<p>Friday 27th<br/>Black kit bags back, all my stuff tayeb , I have had great luck with it, can now dress decently, my mail came in &amp; I got seven letters, three from Ev, one from my mother, replied at once.</p>
<p>Saturday 28th<br/>Rode 7 miles to the other camp, saw the Dr., all O.K., then went up to the mess, it was like a huge hotel, they made a big fuss of me and insisted on me staying to a smoke social they were giving to the Sgt's of a Welsh regt.  I stayed, recited and then I remember no more.  There was a beautiful Welsh Choir singing &amp; they must have gone to my head.</p>
<p>Sunday 29th<br/>Left after breakfast, they were a sorry looking lot that sat down that morning.  S.M. Sgt. &amp; myself rode home, arrived safely, had to then do a sick parade &amp; purchase mess goods, leave starts tomorrow.</p>
