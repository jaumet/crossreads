 Dear Dad, Mum & George, 
 Ellis has gone up to Dick's flat to play cards but I have not written for over a week so I am just scribbling a few lines to you & to Auntie while I have the chance.  We are kept very busy all day & we generally have 2 nights dancing, 2 at the Cinema or Theatre & I go to Sarum once a week & stay the night with Mr Edmonds.  I was there on Wednesday night having spent the afternoon with Mr Freemantle at the Close.
