<p>[Tuesday 17 October 1916]</p>
<p>Laura &amp; I went to Walsall to meet Major Brace a friend of Dollys.  Sleeping at the Hotel while I'm away.  Brace is bloated, fat, &amp; drinks too much whisky-   I do not think he will live to be an old man-   Laura is afraid of him.<br/>I return tomorrow.<br/>Brace is Recruiting Officer here &amp; draws a Major's Pay-  He never mentioned the son in law or anyone, Laura is much happier living by herself in London she is a slave when with him-<br/>Young Charlie has made his will.</p>
