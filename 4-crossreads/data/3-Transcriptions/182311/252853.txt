<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; How good to be in a home again, how nice to sit down at my Uncle&#39;s table, the genuine goodness of all my relatives, their ready hospitality and real pleasure in my company were things of great price to me; really when one is living, however comfortably, in billets, hotels, trenches, or travelling about, the simple pleasure of being in a home and with a fellow&#39;s own folk is really intense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Great Aunt and Mary were away, for it is the holiday season, but I saw again the majority of my relatives.&nbsp; Saturday evening I took very quietly, Sunday morning I went to The Ebenezer Chapel (Wesleyan) and in the afternoon along the Hoe with Syd and his Sergt. enjoying the beauties of Plymouth&#39;s foreshore.&nbsp; The next day was Monday and on Mary&#39;s return to town she took me visiting and sight-seeing, and then catching the midnight Great Western I returned to London at about 7 a.m. went to Belgrave Square and slept until 1 p.m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on Wednesday (6th June) was the Investit-ure, reporting at Buckingham Palace, being marshalled in a great reception room, moving before our King, bowing to him, approaching him and hearing him say &quot;Pleased to invest you with your Military Cross,&quot; then a handshake, another bow and away.&nbsp; One of the great moments in a fellow&#39;s life I expect, but it passed very swiftly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Cross is now in the hands of Mr.John Clark, 12 Ludgate Square, for I didn&#39;t want to post it away just at present, for the submarine menace is quite a real thing and I don&#39;t think I could get another if it did go down.</p>
