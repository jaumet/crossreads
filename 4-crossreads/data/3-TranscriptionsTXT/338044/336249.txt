It has been rebuilt but the old moat, drawbridge, cannons etc remain    This place was originally taken by William the Conqueror, taken & retaken by the French several times & now but it's walls remain    After climbing the towers, viewing the well, exploring the subterranean passages, we descend to La Bouille take the 8-15 pm boat to Rouen arriving at 10 pm & off home after what I consider a great day   Had dinner at La Bouille & very nice, costing 3 Francs (app 2/3).
