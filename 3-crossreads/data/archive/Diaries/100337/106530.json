The Doctor examined me, and told me that there was nothing wrong with me, He sent me back to work.</p><p>As a rule when a Prisoner is sick and there is no sore visible, he is classed as fit, And in the majority of cases, is driven out to work. But if he has a cut or sore, that can easily be seen, he is as a rule allowed a day or two off from work. You can be almost dying at times, and if you can show no mark or anything that looks sore to the doctor, out to work you go.</p><p>On Friday and Saturday the 22nd &amp; 23rd of March, we had some slight rain. Sunday was very cold &amp; dull looking, On Monday we had more rain &amp; snow on Tuesday.</p><p>It is published that the Germans have started their offensive on the Western</p><p>[Anchor]</p><p>[Page 109]</p><p>Front in the region of Cambria and Arras. And that they have advanced twenty kilometres and captured a large number of cannon, and 25,000 Prisoners mostly English. The German civilians here, say that their Soldiers are not allowed to send letters to Germany while this move is on. The Flags were flying here to-day.</p><p>On Thursday the twenty eighth day of March, The German papers published the reports of the German offensive on the western front as follows. That we have been pushed back to the town of Albert on the Somme district, A distance of about 50 kilometres.</p><p>Albert is where we checked the German advance in 1914, and also where we started an offensive in June 1916. It had taken us two years to get to the point that we were at, before the Germans started their offensive a few days ago. They claim to have undone this, (which has taken us two years to get) in six days. I will not believe this</p><p>[Anchor]</p><p>[Page 110]</p><p>until I get some more reliable news that what is in the<br />German papers.</p><p>If it turns out to be true, our side must be slipping a good deal lately. Some more news is that we have retaken two small villages close to Albert. According to later news the amount of Material, munitions and Prisoners taken during the offensive were , :- very large quantities of stores, 200 guns &amp; ammunition, and 70,000 Prisoners mostly English. These figures do not show that it was such a big victory. I expected to hear that the losses of our side would easily have been three times grater, for a big move like that.</p><p>During the week we had snow on two occasions , it has also been raining on and off during the whole week.</p><p>Sunday 31st of March and Monday the 1st of April are both Public Holidays, consequently we have no work to do. I received 10 letters this morning (Monday) so I set to and answered them, Needless to say that I did not write as many as I received, I</p><p>[Anchor]</p><p>[Page 111]</p><p>wrote one, which was the answer for everybody.</p><p>During the afternoon of Monday 1st I went with two other Englishmen and a Russian, to visit another Englishman, (named Lounds) who was working at a factory where the Coffee &amp; Meat extract cubes were made. H showed us all over the place, (which was very dirty ) and also showed us what the coffee &amp; meat Extract was made from. The coffee was made from the refuse of Vinyards that is, the skins, storks &amp; seeds of the grapes, after all the juice had been drawn from them &amp; fermented. The stuff smelt awful, and fowls were walking over it and scratching it about. I didn?t drink much German coffee for a long time after that. The Meat Extract cubes were manufactured form Potato peelings and course salt.</p><p>On Sunday the 7th Reports say that the Germans have taken three more villages 15,000 Prisoners and another 200 guns.</p><p>The weather for the past week has been fine but cold. The food as usual, bad. To-day Monday 8th April is a little windy and cold.</p><p>[Anchor]</p><p>[Page 112]</p><p>Yesterday was slightly cold and windy, To-day Wednesday the weather is beautiful, The mornings papers to-day the 12th say that the Germans have taken two more villages from us, Also that British and Japanese troops have landed in Russia to operate against the Bolshevists.</p><p>I wrote to the Red cross acknolledging the receipt of a ?Personal Parcel&quot; from Australia. The food these times is very bad, It is getting ever scarcer, Everything here is an awful price, Cigarettes range from 10 phennings to 20 phennings, the stuff that the civilians are smoking is a mixture of the dandelion flower and some scented leaf, It smells like an Australian bush fire when smoking. Luckily I get most of what I want from England, and am to a certain extent independent of the German tack.</p><p>Yesterday it was 12 months since I was taken prisoner, At times it seems like twelve years, at others, Its like only so many weeks.</p><p>To-day news has come to hand that the German have started another offensive in</p><p>[Anchor]</p><p>[Page 113]</p><p>Flanders in the region of Ypres and Armentiers, and that they have taken one or two of our strong positions, and ten thousand prisoners</p><p>Another batch of Prisoners (Russians) came to the fabrik to-day, ten in all.</p><p>For the last few days I have been studying a German Grammer book, trying to pick up a little German, But I do not make much progress. I am going to write to England for one or two books on German, and start to study the Language in my spare time.</p><p>The weather is getting much warmer now, all the frost has gone and the trees are beginning to grow their leaves again.</p><p>On Saturday I wrote to Alma granting her permission to draw my money, which she asked for. On Monday April the 15th news came through that Armentiers had fallen into German hands. The clocks were put back one hour at midnight last night for daylight saving, It is twilight till about 9 o`clock at night. To-day I wrote to England for some books on German Grammer, I intend to study the language while I have the chance.</p><p>[Anchor]</p><p>[Page 114]</p><p>To-day Tuesday the 16th of April the German papers say that, Count-Czernin the Austrian Minister for War has resigned. The Kaizer also commends the British troops on their great bravery shown during the German offensive. The Germans have not got their War-loan. The Government is asking the people to send Horses &amp; carts, Irion, Zink, copper &amp; other material, if they have no money to give.</p><p>The British Ambassador to Holland visited the camp to-day April 17th. We complained about the sanitary arrangements, which were disgraceful, We also complained about working on Sundays and not being allowed time off during the week . We also showed him the state of the sleeping quarters and dining room. He made notes of all that we told him and promised to do all that it was possible to have things altered. He admitted himself that we had plenty of room for complaint.</p><p>[Anchor]</p><p>[Page 115]</p><p>Wednesday. 17th the Germans also claim another success close to the town of Armentiers.</p><p>On Sunday 21st I injured my back whilst I was working, I had 6 days off from work in consequence. When I started work on Sunday I felt my back to be slightly sore, and after I was working for a while it got worse &amp; I was absolutely powerless to do anything, I could not use my arms to put my coat on, I returned to the Barrack and got another man to go in my place. I went to the Doctor on three occasions with it the following week, he did not give me anything for it, But just looked at it for a few minutes each time. On Monday I started work, but owing to my back not being fit I was sent back to the Barracks being of no use.</p><p>On Tuesday the 30th of April I went to the town of L\u00fcneburg to do some shopping with some other Englishman, I bought a cigarette holder &amp; case, Meerschaum pipe, tobacco-pouch, Watch &amp; watch case, and a gold ring. About 60 marks in all. I did not manage</p><p>[Anchor]</p><p>[Page 116]</p><p>to keep the things for long. The Cigarette holder and case, I lost soon after I bought it, The Meerschaum pipe I smoked about three times then let it fall out of my mouth &amp; smashed it in three pieces. The tobacco pouch I tore one day when I was getting some tobacco out of it. The watch and watch case I gave to cousin Wilfred when I returned to England, And the Gold ring I left in the lavatory at St. Pancras Railway Station London.</p><p>The food has been very bad lately with the exception of a day or two when we had it fairly good. For the last two weeks the weather has been anyhow. Some days we had snow, and others it was cold &amp; raining. The sun was to be seen on few minutes on one or two occasions.</p><p>I have been in constant recipt of Red-cross parcels from Switzerland containing bread, I also have had parcels of<br />Groceries and tinned stuff from England. letters from England and from Australia have been arriving fairly regularly.</p><p>July 1919</p><p>[Transcriber&#39;s glossary:</p><p>Albert page 60 ? is about 120 kms SE of Etaples<br />R.M.S.
