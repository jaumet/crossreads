5128-9-16.Last night just before tea a disabled Hostile observation balloon was seen to be adrift floating in our direction. Our aeroplanes were round it like sparrows, dropping bombs &amp; using machine guns with good effect. It was pretty to watch them swooping &amp; diving under it &amp; over it for all the world like crows arround a carcase. She sank slowly &amp; when near the earth burst into flames, finish of a German sausage.We couldn't distinguish the smiles of the Pilots as they flew past us on their way to the Aerodrome, which is not very far from here.
Sunday 1-10/16.All clocks were put back one hour last night so had a long night's sleep. It has been a beautiful day to-day
