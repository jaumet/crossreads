6/4/18 ? Front Line ? Albert Dernacourt
It was a wretched and trying night for the men but they stuck it in fine spirits and cheerfulness. Owing to the pitch darkness nobody knew the way round and they had to stand out in heavy rain up to the knees in mud and slush. Then "A" Coy (already very tired and worn) had to furnish a platoon to carry up the rations to the front line. It was pouring all the time. Fortunately I found a petrol tin of rum in the dugout and was able to give a tot to all the men who were working. It put them in good heart as they waited for dawn. Out in front they settled down quietly. We had one flare in the air found the line well back.
