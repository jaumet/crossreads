<p>June<br/>and have a peculiar grey uniform!!</p>
<p>People again very hospitable &amp; dogged tired we will be glad to have a good sleep.</p>
<p>Tuesday 20th<br/>Up &amp; off for another route march about 9 am marched through the business part of the city then uphill along a winding tarred &amp; ideal road around the Devils Peak &amp; rested near Cecils Rhodes old residence. We had lunch here buying oranges chocolate &amp; cakes to reinforce food taken.</p>
<p>We then proceeded further, passed the Zoo &amp; took a narrower road off the main road up the side of the peak to Rhodes memorial which is granite flight of steps about 50 yds across set in a bold position in the side of the hill. Nine large bronze lions and a huge bronze statue of a man bareback on a straining and powerful looking horse <strike>and placed</strike> complete the memorial which is very impressive &amp; a striking reminder of Rhodes vitality &amp; enterprise. The Zoo was I understand formerly his own while <strike>his house and</strike> the estate which forms a huge picnic ground comparable with the reserve of Fern Tree Gully <strike>wer are</strike> is a gift of his to the South African Govt. A very good view is obtained from the path to the memorial somewhat like the view from Fern Tree Gully with a background of hills. The place here is however <strike>only</strike> more thickly populate as it is only about 5 miles out.</p>
<p>On the way back we passed a large number of blacks who to our amusement &amp; their own excitement cheered us. The women were evidently engaged minding the town's washing which, as the day was fine, was stretched on the grass or over fences to dry.</p>
