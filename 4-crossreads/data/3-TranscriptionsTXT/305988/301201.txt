 On July 28th we left the Somme &amp; came up to St Omer just outside of Belgium. We moved about that district for a while &amp; then on 11th August I went on Furlough &amp; missed you at Fovant. 
 16th Sep we moved up to Dickebush in Belgium on the right of Ypes. 19th the Btn moved into the line I did not go in being left out with the Coy's books. 20th the boys hopped over and took every objective 22nd they were relieved. A lot wounded, but here were very few killed. A great success. The Huns we were up against were special troops &amp; we were told that most of them were men who volunteered to come over from the Riga front to have the honour of knocking the Aussies back, but the Aussies were too good for them &amp; gave them a good hiding 29th up again to Ypes. Oct 4th to Railway Wood, thence to Westhoek Ridge our original front line. The next morning I was sent back with the O/Room gear. On the 9th the boys hopped over again &amp; had another win. 11th they were relieved 13th came back to billets near Steenvoorde. 26th Back again to Dickebush. Friday Nov 2nd (2 years O.A.S.) the battalion moved up to supports &amp; I am again left out.
