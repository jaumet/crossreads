<p>20.4.15<br/>Tue. 20th.  Had a touch of tooth ache last night, so I plucked up enough courage to interview the dentist this morning &amp; had it extracted.  No parade this morning &amp; the time was put in getting overcoats strapped on saddles etc. as there was an inspection of the L.H. Brigade by General Maxwell this afternoon.  I did not go as I had an excuse of going on light duties on account of having visited the dentist.  We were paid just before tea time, &amp; I had a game of billiards with Roffe, &amp; had to lend a hand to feed up at 9 o'clock.</p>
