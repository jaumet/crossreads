good so that in all we are doing very well putting on condition & getting in good nick & would quite enjoy it if we were only near home.  Our leave has not come off yet, I don't think it will for a couple of weeks as next week we are shifting to another camp about 20 miles away to a place called - where the winter is felt less severely.  All the Australians are shifting & the Americans I believe are taking our places.  The weather has been beautiful here lately plenty of warm sunny days but today we have had a change & it is cold & windy.  I hope it does not last although I expect in another month the cold will begin to set in properly.  On Sunday afternoon we went for a walk with Arthur over to the old villages where the village blacksmith under the chestnut tree & the old church where the "Village Blacksmith" went, all stands today as it stood then, the whole village is quaint & old
