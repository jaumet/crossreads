  
 July 2 girl in grey is jolly nice. Went to Church at 6.30 good Minister. 
 3 Left for Monte Video Camp, & am now in a hut with the other unfits. We are supplied with beds, do no parades & have our meals in a special hut. It's a bit of alright after being stuck at Westham & having to do Mess Orderly & parades. There is a beautiful view from Hill 60 - on the left stretches the sea & a long sand bank, in front, beautiful green fields, innumerable hedges & scattered hamlets, & to the right lies the Harbor [in margin] Monte Video
