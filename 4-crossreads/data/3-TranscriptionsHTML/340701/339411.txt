<p>Some Bombardment on today.  I seen two of our Battleplanes bring down 2 Taubes this morning.  The morning was cloudy so our planes managed to sneak on to them.  One came down like a ball of fire.  I seen the crater of the mine which was exploded on or about 1st July near Becourt wood it is a wonderfull sight about 50 yds in Diameter and looks at least 100 ft. deep.  Within the last few days the 13th Batt made a charge.  They were to have been supported by the 51st &amp; 54th Batt. through some misunderstanding the latter did not charge, so the 13th were nearly surrounded &amp; had to fall back losing heavily.</p>

Went to another village about 1 &frac14; miles south east of Albert &amp; had a Bottle of very fair Champagne in a very dirty yard.  There is a rumor that the Aus. Army Corp. is going to Egypt after the next stunt, hope it is correct.  Fritz made counter attacks yesterday &amp; to-day.  It was marvellous to see the way our Artillery socked it into him.  It was also</p>
