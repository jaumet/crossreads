Notes
3rd Oct 1915:- Spent this day in hammock with only one blanket &  fully clothed  The wind howled like fury all day long &  the ship tossed in all directions, whilst I did not care what happened. Too rough for Church Parade. Hospital nearly full of Patients, mostly seasick  Eat nothing all day long  Most miserable day &  still worse night. All I remember clearly is the buglers blowing continuously "No Parade to-day."
4th Oct 1915: -
Much better to-day. Weather calmer & I eat a fair meal. Still too rough for parade however, &  "No Parade" again sounded. I get out of my retreat - the hammock in the bathroom - and have a bed instead. A Peculiar thing is the time, always going back &  nobody has the right time
