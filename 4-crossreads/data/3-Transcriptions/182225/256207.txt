<p>1916 &nbsp; MONDAY 21 &nbsp; FEB.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Foot slogging in the park all the morning. The O.C (M<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Campbell) delt with a petition we all signed &amp; gave up to him, asking him to remove Sargent Major [Fulkes?] as we thought he was not competant to drill us. He said it was open mutiny to send up that petition, but he just treated it as foolishness, which it was. If I had read the thing&nbsp;I would never have put my signature to it.</p>
<p>Got late leave and also got the early train to Sydney. Got my watch glass put in at Hardy&#39;s and asked P.S.&amp;B to get me a box for Wednesday night at the Criterion. Had late leave &amp; Linda &amp; self went to the Cremorne Pictures &nbsp;Went home in the 11.35 train to Marrickville</p>
