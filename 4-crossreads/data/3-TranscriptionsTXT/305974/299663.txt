9 ThursdayThis isn't a very big village.  It was a fine day to day I can tell you we all appreciated the warm sun.  Saw Clive Dwyer in the evening.  We didn't do anything all day, so I wrote four letters in the afternoon.  The Huts we are in are light structures with tarpaulins thrown over they.  We are expecting to be here for a few day.  Saw Dan Dignian [?] & Tom Turnbull in the 13th Btn.
10 FridayIt was very misty until about 10 oclock this morning.  This evening I can hear a rather a heavy  bombardment on our left.  Went for a route march about a couple of miles out on to the top of a big hill where a splendid view of the surrounding district can be obtained, There was a very heavy bombardment all night no news though.  A German Airoplane bombed the Div. Rest station.
11 SaturdayThere were 12 casualties.The bombardment is still continuing.  The 4th Fld Amb played the 4th Machine gun Coy League foot ball this morning, scores M.G. Coy 6, 4th Fld 3. & we again played the Royal Engineers in the afternoon (socker) scores R.Es 3 to nil.  Saw Jim Lihou  & Bob Stewart in the evening.  The days are very misty & cold now.
12 SundayThere was a very exciting game of socker between the 4th Machine gun Coy & the Royal Engeers  Score M.G. Coy 1 to nil.  The bombardment reached a very high standard during the night
