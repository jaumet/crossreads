 Wednesday 15 January 1919 Nice &amp; warm again.  We can see Trawlers sweeping for mines on the coast &amp; I dreamt last night we were embarking from the Beach here &ndash; a la Gallipoli but for home. My job of writing War History of the Regiment means a good deal of extra work &ndash; if I had my old Diary I could do it well but it has to be done at once. One has no conveniences cramped in a Tent &amp; other calls on my time.
