 March 4th 1916 My Dear Mother No doubt you allreadi know that the Brigad is in Franc , we had a splendid trip over . Stop at Toulon en Rout , but no Troop were allow ashor , as we were onli there for one night , Toulon is a veri pretti place , the hill rise behind the town , on the Southern side of the bay are orchard etc , and some rather fine build , we land at Marseill and entrain straight away . The journey through Franc take some time and we were onli out of the Train for a littl while , at some of the Stop place , but I enjoy everi hour of daylight , Franc is a beauti countri , with it tini green field and hedg , along the line everi piec of land that is ani good is cultiv even on the hillsid , where you would think it was allmost too steep to cultiv , the line follow a River , or I should say , run besid a river , for mile , I dont know the name of the stream , but it is a pretti trip along the valley and when the spring is more advanc and the hedg etc , are green it will be pretti inde , Along some part of the line patch of Primros and Cowslip were grow in abund , and daisi they grow everi where . just the same daisi that we take so much troubl to grow here . The field will soon be white with them .
