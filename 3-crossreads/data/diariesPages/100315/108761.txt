7/4/18 ? Albert-Dernacourt Line
The artillery activity of the enemy is very marked and fierce shelling continued all night. Round Bn. H.Q. we had a rough time and some shells landed very close. Fortunately there were no casualties. Dawn passed uneventfully and there was no attack. Mud is deep abround . Walked round the men's bivvies and some of the sights would make an angel weep. Poor dirty tired lads sleeping crouched in filthy wet holes. Those who were awake were cheerful and happy ? what an example to us are our men. It appears strange to be fighting on the old well known road
