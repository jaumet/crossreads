<p>Messines<br/>Gee but it has been cold today. I did old Garfortt's shift for him so therefore slept all day today. Waking only for meals. Wrote several letters.<br/>Executed the 8 to 12 pm midnight. Charlie Adey well stung.<br/>A bit of a stunt on at 7.15 pm a small barrage.<br/>Witnessed a perfect sunrise this morning dressed in a shirt and top boots. <br/>Tom Codey waiting for leave pass to arrive.</p>
