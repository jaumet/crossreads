<p>9.3.16 Thursday<br/>Spent the bigger part of the day in the Saddle exercising the Horses &amp; out on treck with the wagons.<br/>Went up to the Town in the evening &amp; regaled myself on Port Wine on the Piazza of the Grand Heliopolis Hotel.</p>
<p>10.3.16 Friday<br/>Took over a further 49 Wagons Limbers Water Carts etc from the 1st Divisional Train, who have gone to Sed-el-Bisher, where they will camp for 10 days &amp; then embark for France.<br/>We are the next train to go, so we are looking forward to the voyage, which I believe takes 7 days.<br/>Went out riding last night &amp; met with misfortune.   I had a horse which is very hard to mount &amp; as I had to get off for something &amp; he started to play up I was left in a rotten predicament.  There I was in the middle of the local Desert &amp; could not get him to stand.  However after a half an hours struggle I managed to get on him &amp; started for home.</p>
<p>Have not had any mail for a long while but I am expecting some</p>
