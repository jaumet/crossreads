<p>31-12-15<br/>Fri 31st.<br/>Today Les, Reid,Traill &amp; I had some flag practice which saved us from falling in for parades with the troops. We were given our black kit bags to-day &amp; I was glad to see that a new pair of boots I had in it was not removed &amp; practically everything still remained. I scaled away at stables this afternoon &amp; went into Cairo with Arthur &amp; Morgan Welch &amp; Bottomly &amp; had a very good time, going to the Empire pictures the tea &amp; back to Heliopolis in a carriage. Morgan is doing 3 days C.B. but took the risk of scaling out, we have been getting bags upon bags of mail since we arrived there</p>
