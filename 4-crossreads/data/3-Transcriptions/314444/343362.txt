<p>Dear Snowy,</p>
<p>I managed to stop one at last, after a good many close shaves.  I was hit in the groin on August the 25th.  I had a heavy dinner fork in the pocket of my tunic, the bullet glanced off the handle &amp; after making a gaping wound 3 inches square it travelled right across the stomach, finally lodging in the right thigh.<br/>I was operated on at the ambulance station &amp; then removed to the clearing station.<br/>There I had a heavy hemorrhage, was opened up again, &amp; re-operated on. All this little lot within 5 hours. Next morning I was taken on board a hospital ship, &amp; eventually arrived in Alexandria where I stayed five weeks in hospital.</p>
<p>The surgeons only gave me a bare fighting chance of a recovery, but I was in great condition all the 18 weeks that I was on the Peninsula, &amp; that pulled me through.</p>
