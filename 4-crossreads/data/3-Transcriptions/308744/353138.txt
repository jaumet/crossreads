<p>On the 16th the KUTRANI Railway Station, where increased movement had been reported, was bombed three times. These raids were carried out by machines from the Corps Wing, escorted by Bristol Fighters from 1st Squadron. The escort machines were flown by:- Capts. S.W. Addison and A.R. Brown, Lieuts. S.A. Nunan, R.S. Adair, E.S. Headlam and G.W. Sheppard, with the following observers:-  Lieuts. H. Fysh, G. Findlay, H.A. Letch M.C., A.W.K. Farquhar, H.B. Fletcher and E.P. Kreig. During these raids a train leaving the station was attacked by Lieut. Adair and Lieut. Farquhar with machine gun fire, 450 rounds being fired. A similar attack upon a train standing in the station was made by Lieut. Fletcher, 330 rounds being fired.</p>
<p>On the 19th, a special reconnaissance from KEER KARA, LEJJUN AFULE was carried out by Lieuts. E.C. Stooke, D.C.M. (Pilot) and L.W. Sutherland, M.C., D.C.M. (observer) escorted by Lieut. G.C.  Peters, (Pilot) and Lieut. J.H. Traill (observer) with the object of locating a new railway line that had been reported by agents to be under construction. The construction works were located and fully reported upon.</p>
<p>A vigorous attack on enemy troops and transport at MESSUDIEH station and NAKURAH was made by Pilots:- Capt. R.M. Smith, M.C. and Lieut. C.S. Paul. Observers: Lieut. W.A. Kirk and W.J.A. Weir, while out on a reconnaissance on the 21st. During these attacks, which were made from a few hundred feet, 2,000 rounds were fired from our machines, the officers concerned reported the shooting 'effective."</p>
<p>While on enemy aircraft patrol on 23rd. Capt. S.W. Addison (pilot) and Lieut. H. Fysh (observer) attacked 4 Albatross Scouts at 10,000 feet over BIREH. One enemy machine was shot down out of control, and two others were driven downs in a valley North of NABLUS. It was ascertained from enemy official documents captured later, that in this combat, 'one machine broke up, another was shot up and had to break off the combat; the remaining two landed damaged by machine gun fire. One pilot was wounded.</p>
<p>During the period, machines of 1st Squadron for the first time entered upon the duty of 'hopping off' in response to hostile air-craft alarms which were received by wireless.  Having been 'intercepted' on a number of occasions under this system, enemy aircraft began to adopt new tactics. When seeking a reconnaissance of our line, they would approach it from the coast, and at an altitude of from 16,000 to 18,000 feet, having apparently gained this height over the sea.  They would sweep along our line, taking photographs, and having the advantage of this height when first observed, they were often able to make a hurried exit before our machines could get up to their level. However, to combat this new tactic, application was made to Wing Headquarters by 1st Squadron for permission for machines to patrol behind our line at the height named at the times at which the enemy aircraft usually appeared. This was granted, and the enemy machines several times fell into the trap.</p>
<p>While up on one of these patrols on the 26th Lieut. A.F. Murphy (pilot), and Lieut. A.E.K. Farquhar (observer) engaged a two-seater "Rumpler 260.H.P." at 17,000 feet over our aerodrome at RAMLEH. An exciting combat ensued, in which the enemy machine was driven down to 5,000 feet. At this stage, the pilot in the enemy machine fired a Very's Light, and was heading for our aerodrome, evidently with the intention of landing, his observer in the meantime had been wounded. Lieut. Murphy simultaneously noticed that his observer had sunk into the cockpit, and as his own gun had 'jammed' he broke off the engagement. The enemy pilot, observing this, swung his machine round, made a bolt to his lines and made good his escape. Lieut. Farquhar was found to be dead when our machine landed on our aerodromes.</p>
<p>Two enemy two-seaters were forced down near KUTRANI on the 27th, by Capt. A.R. Brown, and Lieut. G.T. Oxenham (pilots) and Lieuts. G. Finlay and L.H. Smith (observers). One of the enemy machines was followed down to within a few feet of the ground by Lieut. Oxenham. The enemy machine landed and both occupants got out and ran, leaving the propeller turning over.</p>
