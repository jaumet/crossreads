<p>Dear old Pards,</p>
<p>Just a line to you all hoping that you are in better straits etc than ordinary. I continue to pass away the months as a Gefangener &amp; probably will keep doing so for another five years: Since last I wrote to you I have gone into a hospital to work. It got on my nerves hanging in the barb compound doing nothing so I undertook a job nigger driving Russians, Roumanian, &amp; Serbian prisoners. It will stand me good for Fiji on my return to the South. They are not so clean as the niggers unfortunately &amp; a good deal more obstinate, but then you know me &amp; my ways; I usually win through.<br/>Tell Mum not to worry about me, as I am well &amp; pretty warm &ndash; the hot weather has commenced in a heap &amp; now instead of snow each day we get a deluge of rain with heavy thunder.<br/>The men you mentioned in your previous note &ndash; supposed here &ndash; I have never run across; possibly they are on working detachments throughout Germany. I had a letter</p>
