<p>5th letter<br/>On the sea again<br/>H.M. Hospital Ship SS Galeka<br/>10.10.1915</p>
<p>Dears,<br/>Yesterday I saw the dear little "odd bit" &amp; her Mother safely on the "S.S. Milano" bound for Italy, and on returning to the Majestic Hotel received my official notice to board the above ship for Lemnos.  We stayed in the Harbour all night &amp; the morning as we were singing God Save the King after service we felt ourselves moving out .  The S.S. Kanouna was waiting along side of us.  She is now converted into a Hospital Ship.  The Matron here Miss Mills is sweet.  The staff of 10 nurses are English c the exception of one N.Z. &amp; one Aus.  They seem a very happy family.  The Officers are sociable &amp; nice.  Colonel Fetherston- three officers [indecipherable] &amp; myself are the guests on board. Colonel F is over from Aus &amp; I rather think on a tour of inspection.  He is making for the 3rd now at Mudros- then on to the Peninsula- from there to England &amp; back again to Aus- by the end of the year.  From what I could gather in a conversation last night he is not too pleased c the accommodation &amp; the comfort of our Nurses generally out here. "He says that all Sisters should be on an equality with the Officers"  he is keen on what he has seen of the Canadians- they appear so smart &amp; up to date &amp; with big hearts like our boys- but they have the most</p>
