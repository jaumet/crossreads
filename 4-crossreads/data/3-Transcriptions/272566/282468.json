<p>Thursday 25 January</p>
<p>Fairly busy all night.  This dugout is very warm and comfortable.  It is occupied by infantry A.M.C. details and also as a trench feet hospital.  The Primus Stove comes in handy for warm meals.  Heavy shelling took place today but we only had a few cases to take down.</p>
