pictures after tea with Yvonne at Eastleigh. Y. is a lovely little French girl married to Langston Earls about 3 months; comes from Bethune & is now my cousin. They gave me such a lovely time, would have liked to stay instead of visit elsewhere. stayed all night again retiring late.
19th. Friday.Caught midday train reaching London where I was kept very busy at bank etc. By 6pm train went to Bolton and reached "North Leigh" about midnight finding them waiting up for me. Never felt so at home anywhere in my life before as here, they were both so loving and homely & nice. Beautifull room and surroundings.
