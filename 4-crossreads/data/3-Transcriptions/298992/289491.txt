<p>a pretty free hand, as far as wandering about goes. I am not supposed to say where I am of course, but did you ever hear of a place pronounced something like "eeper". Will you have a look on the map &amp; you will see just about where we are.</p>
<p>I know this is an awful scrawl but ink is unobtainable and we have not much time to sit down &amp; write long neat letters. They'll probably be a lot worse than this soon too. It is impossible to write nearly so many now, so you can pass the news on to anyone who cares to hear it.</p>
<p>No letters from Australia for a long time now and I'm longing to hear how Hazel is getting on &amp; if Dene has left yet, in fact about you all &ndash; it seems ages since I last heard.</p>
<p>Goodbye for the present Mother dear, &amp; if you like you can post a small<br/> parcel of cigarettes or socks now &amp; again, they will be very useful.</p>
<p>Heaps &amp; heaps of love to you all &amp; I will write again soon before we go to the trenches.</p>
<p>Your son</p>
