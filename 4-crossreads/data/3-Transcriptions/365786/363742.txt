<p>Where is this cheap labour to come from? &amp; how is it to get into <strike>here?</strike> Australia.  We hear of Maltese labour flooding the Country.  Well, far <strike>there were</strike> more Maltese emigrants came to this country in 1912-13 &amp; 14 than since the war.  <strike>They are British subjects</strike> They are Europeans no darker of complexion than Italians &amp; members of the British Empire &amp; 400 of them went down in our ships with our men fighting for us in the Jutland Naval Battle.  All who have come into this country receive union rates of wages &amp; are liable to Conscription just the same as our men are.  As for coloured labour &ndash; what about our Emigration laws, our education test &amp; our poll tax?  What about our Arbitration courts &amp; the minimum wage?  Are these to fail because we are at war?  They will remain in force till the <strike>white</strike> present inhabitants of Australia repeal them &amp; until this happens we need not fear <u>the bogy of cheap coloured</u> labour.  Some say it will destroy unionism, &amp; many a working man selfishly fears to vote yes on that account.  But <strike>is</strike> are not <strike>the essence of unionism</strike> the sayings "Unity is strength"</p>
