  
 Friday April 27th A lovely day. Caught Electric tram to Ealing, & underground train to Charing Cross London. My intentions, are to visit the Robinsons at 52 Lefevre Rd Bow. After asking numerous policemen, who gave me a different direction each time, & riding about the East end of London  for about  in buses & trams for about 2 hrs, I eventually arrived at the above address. Found the people to be very nice. They were waiting for me & gave me a very cordial welcome. Spent a very enjoyable afternoon. Went for a walk through Blackwall Tunnel, I can now say I have been both under & over the Thames River. Arrived home about half an hour late, very tired. 
 Saturday April 28th We always give a hand in the ward of a morning, & by doing so are always sure of a  walking out  late pass (until 9 pm). Went to Ealing by tram this afternoon, but as it was very quiet there another chap & I decided to go to London on the top of a motor bus, had quite a good time. 
 Sunday April 29th A real Glorious day. The weather appears to be getting very much warmer. Went to London this evening, we went to Marble Arch, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Queen Victoria statue. Green Park, the Strand, Trafalgar Square, Pickadilly circus, & back home by the same route as we came out by. It was lovely on top of the Bus in the fresh air.
