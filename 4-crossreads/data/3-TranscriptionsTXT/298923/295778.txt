 22 April 1918 Monday The Carmilite Monastery Comedy Coy: (our men) give their last performance tonight viz:- "7 days leave"- as we go back tomorrow &amp; so far I have  not  got my leave-  I went with Military Governor to a Greek Monastery of Saint George where the Priest takes madmen &amp; cures them with the Chain of St George for 4/-/- a month-  If no money they die-  I asked what the insulators &amp; wires were in each room &amp; the Priest said, to convey the healing spirit of St George from the Chapel in the Monastery- awful old ruffian the British will no doubt stop his business soon
