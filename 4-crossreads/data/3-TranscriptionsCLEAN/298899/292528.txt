which I boarded ultimately reaching my camp at 8.5 P.M. Here I found a state of great excitement. The S.M. had been told that I was left behind & was as wild as possible & when I appeared he seemed to take it as a personal offence & all at once lost his temper & told me that I was not playing the game & that I need not ask him for any more privileges. This set me off & I gave him something to think over telling him that I wanted no privileges from him but that I would demand it. He quite lost his head at being spoken to like this as he rules this crowd with a rod of iron. I then went on night duty but there being nothing doing I managed to get 5 1/2 hours sleep to make up for shortages during the last few days. My conflict with the S.M. had to come, he has been looking for it all the time & I expect more developments.
