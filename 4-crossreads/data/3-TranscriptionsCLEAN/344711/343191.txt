through to the Brigadier, and we saddled up again and made a bee-line for the camp over the sand-hills, getting nearly choked on the way.  All sorts of rumours flying about as to going to the front.  Hope they are true.
8thStruck tents and cleaned the lines.  50 re-inforcements arrived in camp.  Our machine gun sections warned to be ready to leave for the front tomorrow.
9thFell in for church parade.  The hymn "God be with you till we meet again", was sung in farewell to our machine gunners.  The last time I heard that was when the Suevic, with on on board drew away from the wharf in Sydney, 20/12/14.  In the afternoon the Brigadier, Colonel Ryrie, made a speech to the machine gunners wishing them luck, and they marched away to the station in a perfect storm of cheers.  They are the first of our Brigade to go into action and may God's grace and mercy go with them.
