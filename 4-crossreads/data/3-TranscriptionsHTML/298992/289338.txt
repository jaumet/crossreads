<p>Constantinople. All my pals that I came over with are going, though they are Reinforcements, as it is expected that we shall sustain pretty heavy loses at first &amp; of course the gaps must be filled up.<br/>And here am I, lying on the broad of my back out of it all. Gee!!! its hard &ndash; dashed hard. I would give anything I possessed to get away with the boys, and last night I got up &amp; dressed myself &amp; went &amp; saw the Doctor to ask him if I couldn't get out of the Hospital &amp; go along with them. But it was no good, he wouldn't let me go. I would have cleared out, but I knew it was no use. I would only have been sent back. Well I did not sleep at all last night, and am not ashamed to admit that I shed a good few tears. Aren't I unlucky? Just the time when a man ought to be well &amp; in the pink of condition, ready for anything, he goes down to it &amp; is only a drag instead of being of some use. The worst of it is, it may be the last fighting the Australians may see, as it seems probable that their work will be to watch Turkey &amp; see that all is right round this way, &amp; perhaps never get to the front at all. I cannot tell you how I would love to be in the march into Constantinople. Our boys are leaving tonight at 12 o'clock for Alexandria, &amp; I daresay, we'll go right on then to the Dardenelles. Of course a lot of this</p>
