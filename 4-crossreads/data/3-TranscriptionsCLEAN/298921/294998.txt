January, 1915Monday 25Out of sight of land again. The Red Sea is between 80, & 100 miles wide here, & the Arabian Coast is a hostile one.We pass several P & O boats en route Australia & Singapore & I wish I was able to send you greetings by them.Nights are very bright now & heavy dew falls - We have lost the Southern Cross & have instead the Great Bear & the North Star.Regret to say 4 of my men refused to be vaccinated & must be sent back & replaced by others.Later above men changed their minds.
