 Fritz has been use a lot of incendinari shell of late , they look veri pretti of a night for they light up for a long way round with a bright fieri red . 7th Old Fritz put a heavi fire on us first thing this morn it continu right up till dinner time when he slacken off . I had as narrow an escap this morn as ever I have had , for that matter wish to , I was walk over to see Dimock , when my well train ear heard a big shell come my way , I knew it was no use run so I just stood still , held my breath wait for the fear crash these are moment one never forget , wait for what seem almost certain death for you are so powerless , what was probabl a second seem an etern to me down she come , there was a blind flash , a sicken thud the earth seem to rush up meet me , the next thing I knew that I had been flung in the air had land in the mud great lump of dirt were fall all round me , I was half daze my head was full of train rush
