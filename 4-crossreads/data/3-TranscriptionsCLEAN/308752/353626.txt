 Last Friday 1st November an Inspection was held of the Ambulance by the G.O.C. of the Division - General Hobbs.  He seemed well satisfied with the turn out. Pardre Gant from Le Havre held a meeting in the Cinema Tent on Sunday evening & a very fine crowd were present.   The 4th inst. I took over the Post man's job, as our worthy Postman had gone on leave.   A comfortable job. I have an office to myself. More great victories came to hand during the week, & naturally the troops are in a good humour. A Euchre Party, Whist Drive, Two Lectures & a Dance, are held during the week, so you can see that we are having a good time here. Unfortunately the weather has been rotten lately, the Winter has started in earnest continuous rain for four days.
