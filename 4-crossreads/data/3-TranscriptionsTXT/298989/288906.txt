Anzac15/12/15tinned chicken sent up by A.S.C. who are clearing out stocks. After dark very heavy machine gun fire and bombing up on Russells Top. Before stand to, up the firing line talking to the men. They have rigged up notices. "TrenchesTo Let" "Abdul! Call again in Spring". All the lads as happy as Larry. A bright moonlight night, the hospital ships gay with lights close in. We are making some noises in front with rattling tins for Abdul's benefit. Gave Hogarth the tip to dispose of mess stuff.

The "human machine gun" still flourishes but the voiceless bomb maniac is missing. A big gun (new) of ours slashed out suddenly at dusk and provoked a prompt reply of shells from Abdul most of which burst in the air
