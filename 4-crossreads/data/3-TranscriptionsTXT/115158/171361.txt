 at all times had to be able to raise steam, &amp; proceed to sea at the shortest notice.&nbsp; There were 3 watches of Stokers, one of which in turn, was always on watch.&nbsp; At night, when at 4 hours notice for full speed, only half a watch was kept on duty.&nbsp; The Engine Room artificers kept watch only at sea, &amp; in harbour overhauled machinery, etc.&nbsp; The department was organised for every conceivable emergency, from fire &amp; torpedo to collision &amp; action.&nbsp; I felt leaving the &quot;Australia&quot;&nbsp;very keenly, for I had made many good friends in her in the past 3 1/2 years.&nbsp; I had seen her in the piping times of peace in all the gay trappings of a smart flagship, and in the sombre rig of a fighting ship in wartime.&nbsp; Her ills had been my ills for 3 1/2 years.&nbsp; In her I had been round the whole world, &amp; I had been happy the whole time in her.&nbsp; I had received loyal support from the members of the Engine Room department &amp; I regretted leaving them particularly, and the praise which I received from my Captain on leaving the ship was really due to them.&nbsp; A better crowd, I never wish to sail with.

 I left the ship on December 19th., in a blinding snowstorm.
