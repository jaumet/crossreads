Firing Line Grinchy
17/1/17 at 8 pm brought in a Fritz. Corporal Friedric Litterst 2 Batt 29 Ersatzby Reg a very smart little chap. He got lost and near our lines was hiding in a shell hole. The boys got him in by beckoning with one hand and holding a Mills grenade in the other. He gave us some fun in his comments acted on different notabilities and was duly fed and given drink. When questioned he said he would not answer being a loyal soldier of the German Army. Relief was complete at 9.30 pm and the return to camp was memorable. The snow was inches thick over everything and flares going up made a beautiful sight. All shellholes were frozen over and duckboards were coated with ice and so slippery that capsizes were frequent. The tracks were hard to find in the vast sea of snow and we plodded on like machines slipping and falling. Reached padres soup kitchen and had a good hot cup of cocoa and some cake and after seeing the Brigadier made for camp passing a few poor tired derelicts. Old Dooley crippled painfully hobbled in. had good hot meal in huts and felt dog tired
