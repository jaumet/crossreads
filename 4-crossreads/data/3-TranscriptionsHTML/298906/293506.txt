<p>a draw, after a good fight. I hear tonight that the "Karoola" has been sunk &amp; a lot of our mail has gone down with her, enough to make a Saint swear after taking the trouble to write letters &amp; then have them sunk on you<br/>25th. Had an early breakfast &amp; then a good long route march it was a nice march for we went through several old villages &amp; crossed &amp; recrossed the river several times, &amp; the scenery was very fine, though the morning was very hot &amp; close the 2nd T.B. were also with us &amp; we had both bands so we were well supplied with music, we marched practically all the way at the "trail" light infantry</p>
