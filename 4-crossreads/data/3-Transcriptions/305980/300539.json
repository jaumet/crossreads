<p>28:  Reconnaisance to Sheikh Zowaiid (16 miles) but nothing seen by our night patrols.  Large Bedouin village, well laid out with fig trees &amp; orange groves.  Inhabitants seem rather hostile to our troops, but we have them well in hand.  Stayed here for the night in pouring rain.</p>
<p>29:  Left Zowaiid 8 a.m., reaching Arish at 2 p.m. after an uninteresting trek.</p>
<p>31:  Quiet New Years Day;  munga very scarce.  Went to bed at 7 p.m. Cruel weather &amp; during the storm tonight a supply ship was washed ashore &amp; wrecked.  No parcels from home to date.</p>
