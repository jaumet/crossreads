Beautifully cool and calm today and we should be in Malta today or tomorrow. I think I can go through without becoming sea-sick. We only lost sight of Crete this morning. I never imagined it was so big 45,000 inhabitants mostly Greek and Turks at present under the control of Greece formerly Turkey. We have been passing numbers of boats and small Is. The coast line of Greece was in sight this morning so we are not far from Salonika. The Sunset was absolutely glorious today and the ocean like glass without a ripple.

Nothing of any importance happened today. We passed a good many boats but no land of any description We only have one general assembly in the morning so we are enjoying a fairly good rest. We held a very good concert on board tonight before dark. Some very fair artists with 29th Battalion band as orchestra We are in an awfully slow boat only averaging about 7 or 8 Knots. A very large boat with 3 escorts passed about sundown.

We passed by Malta about 2 a.m. this morning but of course we were all sleeping. I will probably strike a guard of some sort tonight. Passed Pentigos Is. off Sicily about 9 a.m. and also about half a dozen trawlers doing patrol work and several large vessels. The band plays every morning on the officers deck to break the monotony. The weather has become considerably cooler today in fact a little chilly. We expect to reach Marseilles on Friday night or Saturday morning.

I mounted main ship’s guard last night at 6 p.m. and go on until 6 tonight. It is the first time I have used a rifle on duty with 50 rounds of ammunition on my bandolier. We are only about a day’s sail from Marseilles now. I thought we would see the coast of Sardinia but must have passed it during the night. We passed another Island this afternoon which I fancy must have been Corsica. I believe we are to go through Paris on our way as it was read out that it must be understood by all ranks that no leave will be granted there.
