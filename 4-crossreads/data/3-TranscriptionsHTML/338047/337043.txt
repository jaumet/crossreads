<p>1919<br/>May 27<br/>who had formed up somewhere, came marching [indecipherable] so the officer &amp; myself pushed [indecipherable] the crowd &amp; joined them.  [indecipherable] nearly up to the station when [inecipherable] by a cordon of police.  They [indecipherable] best thing we could do was to line the street,so we gradually fell back &amp; linked hands to keep the mob back (incidentally getting a good possie for ourselves).  On the station (accordingly to reports) the Mayor of St Pancras was waiting to welcome the two heroes, but some Aussies were also waiting, &amp; when the train arrived the Aussies took possession of the two, &amp; leaving the Mayor, Aldermen, &amp; illuminated address, standing, carried the two off to two cars, &amp; started a triumphal procession.  We held the crowd back till the cars passed, &amp; then the crowd became solid behind them.  I was nearly squeezed to bits.  After about 10 minutes I managed to reach a side street &amp; got away.  I made for the Winter</p>
