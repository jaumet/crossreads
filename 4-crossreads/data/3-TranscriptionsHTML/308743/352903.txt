<p>9 January 1915<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Stables at 6.<br/>In the morning I as usual acted as cook &amp; made porridge.  I'm getting real proficient at the act.  Another batch of letters arrive but none for me. I must be satisfied at mine.  Mackworth arrived &amp; called his scheme through.  I stayed in camp &amp; tried to fix up my motor during the day the appeal was returned &amp; now the motor is going to sent into Cairo to be repaired. The afternoon was a holiday for all hands most of the men went on leave, but I wrote letters Fletcher went to Hebron &amp; left us in the lurch for stables.  Bert Masters went to his lodge last night &amp; had a royal time the people could not do enough for him.  After tea I went for a stroll along the Nile with Bobby [indecipherable] then returned about 9.15 &amp; turned in.</p>
