This afternoon we went for a short route march and after this we had a kit inspection for we are leaving tomorrow I think. There is a strong rumour running round here that the Divisional Medical Major resigned because the authorities would not take no notice of his report on the health condition of the Division, he reckoned the Ist Div. want a long spell for they are worn out and I think he is right.
I was surprised on getting the mail from home to learn that Stan had left Tasmania and is probably in England . I expect we will soon see him at any rate I am looking forward to the time though I hope they keep him in England for some time yet.
Had a great issue of clothing today a shirt for every man and a pair of warm underpants besides other things
