<p>My Dear Mother,</p>
<p>This is the "scrap" of paper to which I am reduced &ndash; but believe me it is quite suitable for one finds little in the way of news to write about. My outlook at present is per several windows, across a ruberoid roof at a skeleton tree against a grey sky. The tree has only become a skeleton in the past few days. Typical English scene, typical English weather --- but not a typical English ward. I believe there is still a war going on somewhere tho all one hears talk of is raid &ndash; raid always raid. Almost one is tempted to believe that they 'have the  wind up' to use modern English.  Harold Horton was on his last leave about the time I hit Blighty this trip and by now, I expect, is in France where I hope he will have Luck and gain more &amp; more pips. Think I shall have to make my next pilgrimage over there with a couple of pips &ndash; it means so much more personal comfort etc (&amp; the pips take several months in the getting &ndash; a good point for the war may not last &ndash; ) But there's a bad point too. The French that is the decent people in that part of Europe that we call France &amp; France calls the "Dirty North," don't like the dashing Anglo-S sub much. The dashing  one of more stars &amp; even crowns, they like less. If the "dash"d one happens to be one of   <u>Us</u>  they hate him quite cordially &amp; refer to him casually as "bete sauvage." Thus  on second thoughts I think   <strike>indecipherable</strike>  it may be wiser to remain what is officially called 'Other Ranks.' It is so much better if you happen to need tucker &amp; decent wine. The leg progresses. Matter of fact there's mighty little wrong with it  bar a bruised nerve &amp; the massage is straightening that out. Of course I am obsessed with a wild longing to return to Belgium &amp; my beloved comrades, we all are. This is the secret of the indomitable spirit of victory permeating all branches of the service.</p>
<p>[The following is written sideways along the margin:]<br/>Not bad sniff for fly-papers that bit! I keep hoping that all is well in Aust, particularly in NSW. But bar the letter at Fangs I have heard not a word. A group of Aussi invalids are now discoursing at foot of my bed &amp; it is impossible to continue writing in the national  (?) atmosphere.<br/>Heaps of Love from Harry.</p>
