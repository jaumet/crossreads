<p>April 1915<br/>last minute.  The boat left at 3.30pm &amp; I caught the 6.10 train back to Cairo arriving at 12.30.  It was too late to get back to camp.  I was tired so I stayed in town all night.</p>
<p>Tuesday 13th<br/>Got the 8.15am train back to camp.  The Regt was out on a field day, so I settled down to read Austn papers I got on the boat.  The day was very hot &amp; dusty &amp; the worst yet experienced this summer.</p>
<p>Wednesday 14th<br/>All the Regt went out to gully past quarries &amp; formed a perimeter camp.  We dug trenches &amp; built a wall &amp; had explained to us how it just would be occupied in real hill warfare.  I was assisting the farrier in the afternoon.  Got letters from Roy Blair &amp; Doug &amp; wrote of Roy &amp; Doles at night.</p>
