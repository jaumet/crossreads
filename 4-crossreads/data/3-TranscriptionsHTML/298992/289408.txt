<p>I have no idea where we shall go to now, when we do go; probably you will be able to form a better idea than we can here, because we hear practically nothing of the War not nearly as much as in the Australian papers. Why, the "Bulletin" of about Novbr 4th had a cartoon of the Evacuation of Gallipoli, and we did not know here till the middle of December. That's only one instance.</p>
<p>Well, Father, I'll have to start and get things squared up ready to have at a moments notice now, so I'll finish this, though I think probably it will be a few days before we break Camp and may even only move to another site then.</p>
<p>Hoping you all had a tip top time at Christmas &amp; New Year &ndash; I suppose having Dene home made a difference &ndash; and that you are not worrying about me, because I'm O.K. and probably will be for some time to come.</p>
<p>With heaps of Love to you all, and tell the girls to write more regularly to me.</p>
<p>Your son. &ndash; Alan</p>
