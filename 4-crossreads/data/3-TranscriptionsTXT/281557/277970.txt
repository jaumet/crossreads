2V. C.  (by a modest Private)& drowned those who fell in their sleepWe fought we charged we battledTill the eighth line of trenches we tookFor every man there was a heroFrom me to the poor old cook& there was the knoll just before usSome two hundred paces or moreWith barbed wire entanglements glistening& the parapets slippery with gore& the Howitzers roared like perdition& vomited fire & deathTill we saw it was madness to charge themso halted a moment for breath.Then up came our gallant majorHis face lit with hopes cheering blissPass the word for pte jugginsHe'll find us a way out of this.If there's on thing I hate it is skitingwhen I hear it I always feel soreSo you won't think Im boasting when I tell youHe ought to have sent for me beforeA great cheer arose as I faced him& said Sir I'll see you through.I've a scheme in my head that will beat them& we'll wallop them black & blue.Then I shook hands with all the battalion(There was only 13 of us left)& they cheered me again till the foemenmust have thought us of senses bereftSo I gathered my arms & my rations& girded myself for the fray.If I live to be ninety or overI'll always remember that day.
