<p>17/2/16<br/>Awakened by Colonel at 0555, could hear 23rd band playing, some officers lazy and lying abed so roused all round. A lovely sunny morning but very raw in the early hours. Work bayonet fighting positions. After breakfast rode round outposts and our forward trenches &ndash; some lovely barbed wire entanglements, rusty stuff festooned up to 2' 2" from ground and 12' wide &ndash; pretty rough for old Abdul's bare feet supposing he comes.</p>
<p>Went round out in front at a hand gallop &ndash; the further you go in this desert the more tempting defence and other positions you see and the higher places for lookout purposes. Party of 250 men working on the wire. We also have detached 100 men as platelayers or rather railway builders just in rear of camp. Rode up to foot of Hogs back and found them under difficulties as regards observation. The top of the hill in a state of skimming agitation all the while, 2 feet of sand drifted into the dugout during morning and the sentry had great trouble with his eyes owing to flying particles.</p>
<p>After lunch went out on the horse again round the defences but returned early and did official work. Took a summary of evidence in the case of fraudulent alteration of pay book and fixed up an officer of the 24th who was under close arrest. At 2000 under arrangement sounded the alarm whistle and in a few seconds the camp was alive with running men silently getting to their posts. In five minutes time the whole battalion was formed up in mass facing east about 900 on parade all in fighting order. Ammunition parties at their posts sigs. &amp; m. gunners at theirs. Within 6 minutes all had moved off complete even to stretchers and within 20 minutes the trenches in the forward line were occupied. Bright moon by which one could read small print, scattered cloud gave the desert a foggy look caused by patches of moonlight. Lights out 2200 and so to bed.</p>
