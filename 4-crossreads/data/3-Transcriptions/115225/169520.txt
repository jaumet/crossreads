<p>Jan 18<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine day &amp; warm, I brightened up the buss a bit in the morning - which consisted of wiping it over with a mixture of petrol &amp; oil to make it look as if it had just been painted, so that Fritz could see them well with the sun shining on them - I read all the afternoon - I received an Xmas billy from Queensland which I thankfully acknowledged in the evening&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
