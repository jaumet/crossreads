<p>1917<br/>2nd June (cont.)<br/>At abt 6 pm Deitrich sent for me.  He had just discovered that the installation was missing.  He asked for an explanation.  He simmered a little when I told him that the gear had gone overboard.  He then gave instructions for the Chf, 2nd, 3rd officers &amp; myself to prepare to be taken on board the raider, all others to remain pro. tem. on board here.  Rees, Isbister, and myself climbed down the "Wairuna"'s  side from the starboard well-deck into the waiting motor-boat.  She crossed at once to the raider, some few hundred yards off.</p>
<p>As we neared her we could make out the seaplane moored on the after-well deck.  We climbed a rope-ladder to the after-well deck.  A group of Officers were waiting at the top of the ladder to receive us, the senior (presumably) saluted each of us as we came over the side.  The German crew &ndash; hundreds of them &ndash; were ranged around the decks watching us.</p>
