<p>June 24 the Kiddies are enjoying themselves in the sands, &amp; riding about on donks, &amp; natty little carriages drawn by goats. This saluting gets on a fellows nerves; so far i've only chucked one. Met ! &ndash;</p>
<p>25 Sunday again in England, &amp; this time in Camp. Church Parade at 10 but I'm dodging that. Might go along tonight. Swept out the hut, there are only a few of us here now.<br/>Lovely down on the Prom this morning &amp; a few waves are rolling in too. My bag has not returned from Plymouth yet.<br/>[in margin] Sunday</p>
