FRI. Nov. 2. Received Parcel of things out of my Pack from Bill Gamble. My leg is looking rotten the doctor told them to put a tube in it & dress twice a day. They also took away a sample of the discharge, so I’m tipping the next thing will be another operation. Put in a good day at my Cushion Cover. Got Letter from Mary B. Wrote to Mother.

Sat. 3. The weather is glorious, a bit cold inn the mornings, but warming up towards mid-day. A number of visitors came round after dinner.

Sun. OCT Nov. 4. Received Box of Cigarettes & Letter from Bacup Got up after dinner & went down the villages on crutches. Plenty of visitors flying about & a convoy of patients arrived. The village is pretty but awfully quiet. A chap came round & took Photo of ward. I gave him Polly Mincher trio to take copies from.

Mon. Nov. 5. Wet, windy day. Stayed in Bed & carried on the Good work with Cushion Cover. Wrote Mrs Ibbs. Bacup.
