<p>Wednesday 17 July 1917 [1918]<br/>Rob's birthday! &amp; never have I been so far away from the dear old boy.  Last night a distinct earth tremor shook the floor &amp; pts. felt their beds quake too.  A strange sensation truly.<br/>Have written Mother, Mrs. Luke, Ida, N. Bell, Muscio, Lucy Holloway since night duty began.  Very hot days &amp; sit perspiring all night.  2 orderlies are both good &amp; pts. stay in the ward, some are escaping from other wards I hear.<br/>Moonlight comes round again &amp; such a still calm broods over everything now (3 a.m.).</p>
