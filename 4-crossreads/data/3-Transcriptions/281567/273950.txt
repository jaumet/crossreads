<p>To anyone who had seen Hazelbrouck previously ( &amp;  my old unit had been camped about there for months) the scenes of desolation wrought by the German advances were appalling. Hazelbrouck but for a few soldiers was ruinous &amp; dead. Borre where I was stationed with my gun teams lay in close proximity to the line  &amp;  therefore under German batteries, the familiar old ventilator of the mill at Strazule had fallen in the ruins of the place, the churches of Pradelles  &amp; Caestre once such familiar landmarks now raised  scarred  &amp;  almost unrecognisable steeples over their respective battered villages,  &amp;  of the Sec Bois where the old 2nd Batt has rested on the edge of the Nieppe Forest nothing could be made out save crumbling farm buildings.</p>
