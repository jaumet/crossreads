<p>[Letter from Ada B. Stutchbury to Mr Eargood. See previous letter]<br/>33rd Battalion Comforts Fund, Branch Depot<br/>94 Pitt St, Scott Chambers<br/>City<br/>June 6th, 18</p>
<p>Dear Mr Eargood<br/>I have received a message from Miss Farleigh, Lieut Farleigh's sister, he was with Lieut Pockley when he was wounded and says: Lieut Pockley begged the stretcher bearers who came to take him to take another poor chap who he thought was suffering more, which they did at his request and when they came back for him it was too late, he had died of exhaustion.  I leave you to decide whether it would be best to tell your daughter.  It is all so dreadfully sad and one shrinks from causing more grief than you can possibly help but it was such a noble act and so like his brother at Rabaul</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>Ada B Stutchbury<br/>(Signed)</p>
