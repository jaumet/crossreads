<p>hearth, just becourse the Father happened to be born in a enemy country, and not in a country wich happened to be fighting side by side with Great Britain. I wher told on my aplication, that my Wife would be notyfied by the authoritys, in due course. My Wife wher notiyfied 2 weeks after my departure. I think it only fair for every married man that he should hawe had to privelege to inform his wife of the departure 3-4 days previously, so as to enable him to receive a visit, and say Au revoir" to his dear ones, trost the poor weeping Mother, as a mans health is allways stronger, and able to bear the pain more easyly, also to fix up anything in need of being attendet to. Owing the neglect of the department in tearing husband and father apart from his family, I am shure these sayd Government has broken many a happy home up for ever.</p>
