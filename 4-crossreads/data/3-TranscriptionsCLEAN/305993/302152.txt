  
 New Years day Fine weather prevailed but rather cold the temperature down to 38 during the day & 33 during the night.  The Bulgarians by what I could gather from those that could speak English, were very sorry that they were mislead & having joined Germany in the war & did not care much for the French but were very friendly with the British.  Varna contained hundreds of German troops until recently & occupied the place for 2 years paying for goods in their paper money which is worthless at present.  After the Armistice they became rough & treated the Bulgarians badly, took the best part of the food stuffs away & whilst there each soldier was compelled to buy so much food & send it to their relations in Germany each week.  All the shops at Varna were closed having nothing to sell, matches 7d a box, boots 3 a pair & other commodities similar.  Yet food stuffs was fairly good during the war being a producing country.  The forts & all Military bases have been garrisoned by the British troops.  The Bulgarian soldiers disarmed & strolling around the streets quite harmless & unconcerned.  The British tommy similar a strong patrol well armed parading the town night & day.  The harbor & houses are well laid out & of the latest principle.
