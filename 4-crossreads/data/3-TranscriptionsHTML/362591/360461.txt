<p>would become perfectly disgusting if she were to see Phyllis (Phyllis being my said horse).  She (Phyllis not Dorothy) is a weight carrying bay mare round &amp; chubby but with a good turn of speed.  She has beaten every horse that she has had a trial with including the Colonel's.  She has delightful feminine ways &amp; is dreadfully greedy.  There are about 4 subalterns &amp; about a dozen N.C.Os all trying to see me at once so I think I had better close.  I am afraid my letters have been scrappy lately.  Our next move looks uncommonly like France &amp; that in a very few days.  Shall have no regret at leaving Egypt.  Best love.</p>
