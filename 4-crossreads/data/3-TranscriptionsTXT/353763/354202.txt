our decks  -  Two officers from the Protector (Spooner & Lane) came to dinner  -  We talked war & its chances in Europe but as we haven't enough factors to go on we are much in the dark  -  We hope that the jaws of the trap are closing on Germany & Berlin but its only hope  -  We know very little  - 
Saturday 26thFive weeks out from Sydney to-day -It is 1.30 pm and for the past ten minuteswe've seen smoke away down the harbor  -  The harbor curves to the SE  -  Round the corner swept the Destroyers 3 in number then the Flag ship - then the Montcalm & the troop ship Berrima and bringing up the rear the Encounter - They were a fine spectacle steaming slowly up in the bright sunshine - The Berrime has gone up to the pier & the destroyers are anchored close in  -  The Flagship is opposite us & the Montcalm & Encounter anchored in line behind her  -  We shall get some news we trust  -  They are all back from New Guinea from Wilhelms Haven we take it  -
