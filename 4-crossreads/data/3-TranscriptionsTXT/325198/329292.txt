 27 April, 1916 Katia On patrol 6 miles out from our camp 30 miles from Canal &ndash; We were on out post last night &amp; came in about 5.0 am &amp; saddled up &amp; were out as a patrol again at 6.0 am.  We saw nothing until we got to a little village called Quazia or Katia &amp; on the hill past this we saw a lot of dead Tommies &amp; Turks, they were stripped of most of their clothes &amp; look a horrible sight. 
 we are at present posted on the hill in front as out-post while the main body bury the poor chaps.  Behind the little grass bumps on the hill here are numbers of Turkish emptied shells &amp; clips. The insects are so bad my mare wont give me a moments rest.  There were about 70 dead buried, mostly Tommies.  They must have put up a great fight against big odds.  The horse lines were a distressing sight.  The horses were all lying dead, tied up to the lines.  We watered our horses at a big well &amp; came in to camp arriving there hungary about sundown. We were pleased to see that there was plenty of food for us when we got in.
