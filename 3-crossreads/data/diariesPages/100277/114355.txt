Woke up this morning chilled to the bone shivering like a leaf one of the coldest raw winds imaginable was blowing straight in on us, I for one did not give a hang what happened I felt that miserable it is nearly impossible for us Australians to keep warm in this weather we sleep with all our clothes on, in fact we dress to go to bed
