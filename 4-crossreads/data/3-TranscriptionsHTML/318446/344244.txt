<p>the axle.  Rained very much last night together with a rushing mighty wind but kept dry myself fortunately.  Bir el Abd tomorrow.</p>
<p>Feb. 13th<br/>Bir el Abd<br/>Reached our destination at last.  Am on picket tonight &amp; have been very fortunate as the drivers are having a birthday to celebrate the proximity of the Cantecus &amp; thus I have had about a cup full of neat whiskey forced down my neck also much cake, they being in the state in which they would give away there last shirt if anyone hinted that it was needed.  At present they are arguing in strident tones on the old theme &ndash; the respective writs of their teams &ndash; and are being very funny about it too.  It seems we shall be here for a couple of months at least.</p>
