  
 proper thing before. I was sorry to hear that poor old Nigger had died; he has been a great old horse has not he - suppose Father will have to buy another draught horse for the harvesting. It was very nice for you having Uncle Fred and Aunt Katie both up home - the car must be the attraction all right which is rather a nasty one for you and Father is it not. I suppose the Sulky and Taffy feel like a bullock dray after being used to tearing along in the car. Those supine tablets you sent me are great things; I got a slight cold the other day and took some of them and it was gone the next day; though I don't think they are very nice to eat for a' that. I have written down Oliver's address but am afraid it wont be much use to me and I may not be able to see Mr Trelawny   for  as leave has been stopped for a bit I think. I was supprised that Oliver is a Captain: the old hands here think an awful lot of him and often talk about what a good officer he was - I wish he was back her now with us but he is lucky having such a good job in England. Dalgety's  & the S.S. Journal are good papers and I read every word of them; Gossip does write well though I don't always agree quite with what he says which sounds very priggish I know but he is a marvellous man - Must stop now! Goodbye Mother dear and don't exceed the speed limit in the old puff puff because if you do you will end up in jail & you would have found it  better  quicker to go slow in the sulky. I am Your loving son Robert C. Wilson.
