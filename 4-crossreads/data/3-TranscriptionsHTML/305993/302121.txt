<p>The H.M.T. Canberra &amp; Burmuda can see always behind &amp; it takes them all their time to keep up twelve knots zig zagging.  So consequently the Indarra had to lead &amp; ahead of convoy about 600 yards the others following astern.</p>
<p>[See images for diagram of straight courses and zig zag courses.]</p>
<p>The Commodore is disgusted at such slow ships being sent with the convoy, such as the H.M.T. Indarra.  He suggested since the Indarra was kept behind at Port Said through the change of crew that she should be sent on her own with a escort of 2 Japs T.B.D.  The result being sent away in a hurry with a strange crew.  We have 4 Indian Quarter masters &amp; only 3 of these can steer.  So consequently made temporary use of the signal men 6 &amp; the gunners 4 which are whites.  Otherwise it would have been very awkward.  Through passing so much wreckage the destroyers were kept very busy rushing from one piece of wreckage to another taking no chances for the periscopes of submarine are often seen projecting amongst such floating obstacles.</p>
<p>At noon today we have 150 miles to Salonika &amp; signalled the Destroyers that the Indarra will leave the rest of the convoy at 3.30 p.m. &amp; put up 17 knots escorted by one destroyer so as to be in harbor by 6 p.m. today the rest of the convoy will not be able to get in before daylight tomorrow.  4 destroyers will remain behind with the convoy</p>
