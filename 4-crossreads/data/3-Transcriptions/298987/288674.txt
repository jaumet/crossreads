<p>Tuesday 24th<br/>Put on Butchers fatigue this morning &ndash; Getting the days meat supply out of the freezing chamber &ndash; Also had to put a number of baskets of Lobsters in the freezer of course a basket got broken open &ndash; by an accident - &amp; my fatigue did them selves well &ndash; but I did not feel very well after a complete lobster &ndash; Went up Town about midday. First to Picture Gallery nothing out of the way Next to Koofman De Wits Collection of Old Dutch stuff no thrills there Then found a Public Bath &amp; had a reall hot bath one of the best things I have struck. The water is a dark brown but quite fresh Pay came to light (10/-) this morning so the financial strain is lifted once more</p>
