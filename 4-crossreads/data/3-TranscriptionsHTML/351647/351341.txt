<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Expect you'll be calling me a lot of rotten names for not writing.  I have been very slack lately but I think you would forgive me if you knew what a lot I have had to do &amp; how very cold it has been.</p>
<p>This new gag of mine is the very devil for work &amp; all clerical &amp; to make things most difficult we have had a cold snap of the worst for the last three weeks, snow storms &amp; frost.  Every thing is white &amp; really I never knew the meaning of cold before.  Several times I could have just sat down &amp; cried with the sheer agony of it.  Fuel of any sort has been very hard to get &amp; the supply most erratic.  I simply can't work when I am frozen &amp; when I wasn't I simply had to go for my life at my work &amp; had no time for letter writing.  All this sounds so rotten &amp; feeble especially when you have been such a dear but I hope you will understand.</p>
