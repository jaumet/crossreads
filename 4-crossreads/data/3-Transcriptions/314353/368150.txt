<p>Oct. 1<br/>4.<br/>Turning in, but for a sleep tonight.  In a low dug out, heavily heaped with time rotted sand, bag'd blocks, and from time innumerable.</p>
<p>A mail in today &ndash; three letters from home, one from Mother July, from Grandma, and a letter Geoff had sent Mother from the land.</p>
<p>Already the word of Muston being turned into Flats, Lindsay evidently the Architect as Mother mentions Court spending a day there.</p>
<p>Outside the dugout Frank and self yarning to two of the 54th and their yarning full of the elation of all their objectives taken.</p>
<p>Waiting the busses outside Steenvoorde yesterday, the 8th waiting too, a party of them strolled over to talk, they mellow with rum, consequently ready for stunting.</p>
<p>In their first innings in this sector last week they'd only two killed:  they by our own barrage.</p>
<p>To some others that joined in after they'd yarned a while, they introduced us as the 1st ANZAC . A.M.C. full capitals &ndash; and with becoming dignity.  The new arrivals honoured us:  and talked of their M.O.</p>
<p>"Our old quacks a M.C.:  if yer sick 'e'll give you the benefit of the doubt every time!  What d'you think of that?"</p>
<p>Always their talk is full of colour &ndash; they'll take a dozen trenches in an hour, and all the while in no spirit of boast or brag.  Simply they're full of the pride they have of their own mates &ndash; that we have of them.</p>
<p>And now too they're admirous of the Artillery:  one tonight gave word of its being 'now an Artillery man's battle'.</p>
<p>On the Somme it was an Infantry man's, and the beggars made it all their own.</p>
<p>Supper tonight:  Mat in a small parcel of a towel and pair of sox (a hundred thanks for the sox Mat) enclosed a tin of asparagus, and a small tin of sweets.  So for supper, asparagus.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I read half of the selected Poetry of Brooke:  this morning back to Keats, and read fully.</p>
<p>"I stood tip toe upon a little hill".  Yet I haven't  read "The City of Fear" fitingly, it should be read in Ypres, where it was written.</p>
<p>The 'City of Fear' to me, on the Somme was Bapaume.</p>
