Sing and wake nowThy sweet lute's soft numbersLull me to restCharm my sorrows awayOh charm - sorrows awayO sing and charm - sorrows awayLull me to restGive me your smile'The lovelight in your eyesLife could not hold a fairer paradiseGive me the right to love you all the whileMy world for ever,The sunshine of your smile.
