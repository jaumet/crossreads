<p>Buire sur Ancre. Picardy   30/10/16 Morning parade by companies, attack practice in waves in the fighting order of greatcoats buttoned back and blankets rolled.  In among rows of trees, all planted in their rows and becoming barer as leaves flutter down each second to the ground on the wings of the wind and carpeting the mud with a thick pad of leaves.  Round all the companies and then walked out of the village to some trenches and selected ground for the afternoon's work.  After lunch we fell in as a Battalion and marched off to the selected parade ground.  It commenced to rain as the men plugged along and soon started to teem in real earnest.  In a very short time everyone was soaking and slipping all over the place.  We carried out an attack in facsimile and took three objectives and then formed up in the torrents and returned home &ndash; a very bedraggled crew.. After a change of clothes, read and chatted round one of these French stores &ndash; sensible warming and cooking apparatus.  Dr Craig came to dinner and spent evening with us.</p>
<p>31/10/16  Went to 24th Batt. headquarters and tried 4 cases &ndash; 3 of desertion and awarded these 3 &ndash; all bad eggs &ndash; 10 years penal servitude each.  In the afternoon rode over to Heilly and had a bath at a Brasserie there.  Very muddy.  The sun shining on the leaves of the trees looked very pretty.  Evening orderly room some of the men were up for assaulting Porter and took a long time to thrash out.  Porter a pretty sight with black and yellow face and had to go to hospital with injuries due to the book</p>
