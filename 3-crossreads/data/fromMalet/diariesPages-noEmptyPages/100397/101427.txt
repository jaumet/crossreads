Tell Bett. that I will send some P.Cs along as soon as I get a chance to get some good ones I have a few Gyppo's with me, they are not every good ones but I will send them along ? also tell her not to worry about sending stamps at any time, thank her for them all the same. So far as spending money is concerned I have ample tell Mother, so there will not be any need to worry thinking I maybe short, in fact I secured an Australian note at the Y.M.C.A. I was thinking of sending it home Bacca. I have just as much as I care to smoke I bought  lb of Havelock Plug in Cairo and still have a plug on hand, They issue tobacco Cigs some of the weed is not much to write home about but I am getting used to it now, a lot of the boys dont care for the Bacca and I generally give one them my Cigs and he gives me his bacca, so I have Plenty. I had a  tin a couple of weeks ago, and had a job to give it away. Chas
