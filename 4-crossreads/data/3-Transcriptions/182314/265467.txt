<p>3/8/17</p>
<p>My dear General.</p>
<p>With reference to any application for the return of the 26th bandsmen, I would be glad if you will let one know your decision.</p>
<p>Today on our route march we passed the 2nd &amp; 3rd Battalions, they each had a strong band, &amp; I felt that they could not but think that this Battalion lacked &#39;go&#39; in not having a band</p>
<p>Since Wednesday week we have had the band once from 3 0pm to 3 30pm on Wednesday 1/8/17. The move of course is the cause of it but the rank &amp; file do not look at it in that light.</p>
<p>I know it is your intention to eventually have fewer bands, but during the past nine months although extra men have been added to the Band, it has not been done with the intention of training more players. Men have been put on other instruments because of actual inefficiency &amp; moreover some men have been returned to the 27th Battalion (this from Major Chalmers</p>
