to dry everything - still raining - had breakfast at 10.30 am - Voted about midday - The country here is very hilly - the name of this village is "Bouchon". Went for a walk through the Village on the hill named L'Etoile An old church some 100 yrs old looks very imposing - it being the highest on the Hill - the grave yard is all around the Church. Got some of the finest wine I ever tasted here they call it "Malaga".
A couple of our own Amb men down with Pneumonia, also several of the Brigade men reporting ill.

Very heavy frost - I was very cold all night, we all have only one blanket - a lot of us to try & get warm went for a walk over the hill & around the Church to Village - bought a post card showing the Village. Butchers Shop - couldn't get any of the Church. It was a great sight to see hundreds of motor transports passing along the road - the 14th Brigade moved out in motor transport, our own transport also left at midday - The people here to be more genuine French than those of the north & Flanders, they are very courteous & obliging - Took over Motor Amb Cars from 17th Tommy Division, they are riddled with shrapnel, they tell some cheerful tales of some cars last seen going heavenwards.
