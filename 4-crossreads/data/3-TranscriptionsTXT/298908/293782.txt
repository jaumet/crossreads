 7th.  This morning I was roused by Alice with a cup of tea, pretty strange for a soldier tea in bed I then got up &amp; dressed &amp; had breakfast &amp; then Eva came down to Plumstead Station with me where I was just in time to catch the London train.  I went as far Cannon Park hopped out there &amp; dived into the District Railway &amp; on to Victoria where I deposited a parcel in the office &amp; also drew my shell band out for Charlie Tonkin &amp; I were going to Littlehampton this morning by the 10.10 train.  I picked Tonkin up at No. 6 platform &amp; having a few minutes to spare we run round to Peel House &amp; got my camera &amp; back to the Station just in time. I forgot to mention that yesterday morning I went down &amp; had a look at the famous "Petticoat Lane" where all the Jews gather of a Sunday morning to sell their wares the place was simply crowded &amp;amp the noise terrific with all the salesmen shouting about their wonderful bargains &amp; goods.
