<p>Believe me dear friend your letter was a great help &amp; comfort to me &amp; if you can all forgive my poor reply, do write when possible. I am most thankful of Mrs Fry's dear letter, &amp; Dorothy's, enclosing the pretty photo of Hazel &amp; her dear wee one, &amp; the group Wilga enclosed of you all. I carry them with me always &amp; look at them very often. Will try &amp; write them very soon.</p>
<p>I am thinking of you all with such truly loving thoughts &amp; if, &amp; when I return you will help to soften the agony of the emptiness of little Mothers absence. With all love &amp; deep thankfulness for your interest in me.</p>
<p>Ever your loving friend,<br/>Ellis</p>
