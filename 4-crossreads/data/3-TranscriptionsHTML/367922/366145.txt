<p>think favourably of this &amp; I hope you will, I can give you the names of some of the others, but not all.</p>
<p>Lest it may appear strange that I should write you thus before having felicitated you on your new relations with Miss Macmanamy I would just say that I had waited to express myself personally, but the opportunity has not occurred except when you were in others company. Please accept my warm congratulations now &amp; with best wishes for the happiness of each turn.</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>Will Moginsly</p>
