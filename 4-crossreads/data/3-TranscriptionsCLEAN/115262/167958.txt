  
 Tuesday 10 July 1917. 
 In hospital. Feeling pretty good & expect to be out tomorrow. Things as usual in the camp. Rumored that the mail closes tonight so must get to work on the letters. 
 "Tommy" camp practically empty now. Geo. Cameron got 2 S.B.&M. Journal papers & I read these also "Herald" dated 26th May. Sgt. Browne got "Argus" dated 17th & 26th May & saw these also. Saw where Pat Lynch has died of wounds in hospital in France on May 6th 1917. He was wounded 5 months ago.
