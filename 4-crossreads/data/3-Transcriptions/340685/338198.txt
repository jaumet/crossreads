<p>One signaller killed by going back to get some gear. Big strafe by our guns at night.<br/>19.6.16 Same work. Reciprocal artillery duel. Good fight between apparently 3 of our planes &amp; two germans. Couldn't tell the casualties. Gas alarm at night but again gas passed by us<br/>20.6.16 Fairly heavy afternoon and evening strafe. I am getting quite used to it and slept through the night attack. Put on the trenches helping to build revetments.<br/>21.6.16 leave to visit Sailly. Left here at 9 and took a long ride on the bike into Sailly &ndash; really lost my way. went to our company's yards and saw how the rest of the crowd were getting on (Deslands down with slight dysentry). Went round to C.R.E. yards where the 1st company were with Hodgson, Collett &amp; Groves but they have gone to Ypres the 13th taking their place. Adjoining the yards is a factory where sand bags are made the work being done by children <strike>an</strike> women and old men all however very smart. very interesting but wasn't allowed inside. Canal runs at the back of the yards in Bac-St-Maur. Dinner of 3 eggs bread &amp; butter &amp; coffee for9 franc and also got 5 pieces of sweets. Rode the heavy old bike over the cobblestones to Estaires N.W. of Sailly and went over the canal bridge into the fairly large town. Fairly few soldiers &amp; mostly French civilians. On the way back got Melva a bonny silk handkerchief for 5 f &amp; also wanted a fine silk shawl for 18 f but of course couldn't get it. Really shouldn't have been allowed in on my duty pass as it should have been signed by the A.R.M. Went for a bonza warm bath when I got back at Sailly in a tub &ndash; half a beer barrel. Down to C.R.E. yards to load up at 4.30 which was the worst part of the trip carrying heavy 8 ft logs to the wagons and galvanised iron and other gear. Back to our yards at 6 and Le Lew &amp; I had a bottle of champagne (demi-sec) for 5 f. Lovely stuff and then after strolling down the street we went to the pictures. Small old house badly ventilated smoking forbidden Volunteer pianiste good who played the Rosary first of all patriotic songs on screen in which we all joined. very fine pictures. First a Keystone</p>
