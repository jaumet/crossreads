 We had 6 hours leave, and went for rickshaw rides. We were going out to Cinnamon Gardens in these man hauled affairs when we caugh the Colonel &amp; Major Smeaton en route to the same destination, so we told the niggers we would give them an extra penny to beat the Colonel. We went flying past him, and as we saluted, taking fine care he saw us, he beamed all over his face. I believe he saw the joke. The trip across the Ind. Ocean was not absolutely calm, but I have improved as a sailor, and so far, have been sick only once day all the way from England. A  re  reception crowd came on at Fremantle, as indeed at Colombo, to give things to those on board who were unable to get on deck to the concert which they provided the night before from the decks of a near by ferry boat. They were very well meaning but oh the mess in our scruplously clean wards! If we have one at Adelaide Melb. And Sydney I ought to be very fat on my return. 
 There are numerous rumours about our plans and itinerary. We may only call at Sydney en route to Brisbane. Then we may come to Sydney by train from Melbourne. No one knows till we get to  Sydney  Melb on Sat next. I will wire from there. We hahad no leave at Fremantle. Will post this from Adelaide. I hope to find everyone very well. I am OK myself. 
 Your loving son Dene.
