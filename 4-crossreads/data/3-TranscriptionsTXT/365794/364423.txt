Tuesday 23 January 1917 [1918]All hospital very quiet & most wards being turned out in turn.  Last lot of V.A.D's are in swarms & some a mass of powder, how can they send these sort of women out to look after these brave boys?Saw Col. Onslow.  40 sisters leaving tomorrow for P. Said.  Went town, drew 4-0-0 at pay office & lent 1-0-0 to S. Steele.  Rec'd letter E.G. Palethorpe lately & reports all well at "Wilga".  Pts. are scarce but one cannot have everything.
