Saturday 12 January
Pay day. Nothing to report. An old fashioned picture show to-night at Y.M.C.A., pictures I saw ten years ago. "Padres" in the army in the field are a force and we have not seen one for over a year.

Beautiful fine day a walk to Ballieul this afternoon. Nothing at all of interest.
For about an hour I watched the ?planes landing, rising and stunting over the ?drome at Ballieul. The more I see of the machines the more I marvel at them.
