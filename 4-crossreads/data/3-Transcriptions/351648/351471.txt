<p>Mrs. John,</p>
<p>For such a friend as you the good Lord's name be praised, amen!  Have recd. your No. 7 or No. 8 which?  No. 8 I think and also a parcel of tobacco for which I again send my very best love &amp; ten thousand thanks with a flourish of the arms &amp; a shrug of the shoulders in my very best French style &ndash; you were in the midst of gardening &amp; anticipating a family of young lambs to have charge of &amp; expecting a very busy time &ndash; I hope the worst didn't come to the worst.</p>
<p>Where did I get to when last I wrote?  Anyhow since then I've been to London again &amp; had the time of my young life and it was all due to a huge bit of luck, just at a time when leave seemed very remote &amp; under a spot similar to Heaven in its inaccessibility when I was fed up past the brim &amp; grit of life, when I'd just taken a new horse out for a trial &amp; it had hurt my knee by falling on it &amp; I was wondering how I could swing</p>
