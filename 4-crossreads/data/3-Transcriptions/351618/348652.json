<p>but those that can do the impossible are the ones required in this great campaign to lead.</p>
<p>Friday 5th Nov.<br/>Just nosed about to-day getting a little here and there. There was only one Greek fruit &amp; nut shop to buy from &amp; it was in charge of or owned by a very excitable individual and also very independant. He would close up shop just when it suited him even if there was dozens of customers waiting. The prices were restricted by the military Authorities. I got some nice apples &amp; nuts to bring back. R.Q.M.S. Perry 7th LH was also over to purchase for his unit and he went up to one of the Villages on Thursday but up till to-day he had not returned.</p>
<p>As my work in buying guarding was so much I could not leave</p>
