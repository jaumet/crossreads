<p>too lengthy a one to remember. The spirit of the men of this Battalion is evidenced by a remark of one of the men made to the Divisional Commander subsequent to the failure of the second attack of the Turks. "I wish they'd come on in the real attack. I don't call what we've had much of an attack".<br/>The other three battalions of the Brigade did equally well, and names of officers that can be remembered who distinguished themselves are Majors Kingdon, and Davidson, Lieutenants Lloyd and Howell-Price, Captains Jacobs and Jackson and Sergt. Frame, all of the First Battalion, Stevens 2nd Battalion, Scott and Mapie of 4th Battalion.<br/>After this attack preparations for assuming the offensive when the time arrived for doing so were undertaken, and also mining operations. The system devised was all underground work. Tunnels were driven forward and a new firing line. also underground. One vast continuous tunnel was commenced on a frontage of nearly a thousand yards.<br/>The vast amount of labour invloved may be imagined, yet by August, when it was hoped the arrival of reinforcements (to be landed at Suvla) would mean a general forward movement.  A perfect system of tunnels leading to the new firing line were, together with the latter cutting, completed. During this period there was at times heavy fighting and mining. The attack on German officer's trenches in July by 100 rifles of the first Battalion under Lieut Lloyd must be mentioned. This trench which was a continual menace to Quins Post, and contained machine guns was rushed and partially destroyed some 40 out of 100 rifles</p>
