are closed at 9 p.m. & when we got there all Australians had been moved out of the environs of the city further into the desert & there was hardly a trooper to be seen anywhere, there were a considerable number of officers both Australian & English up on leave & the Hotels were full of them.  Going into the Continental I met more men I knew than one would see in Sydney at present in a month, it was delightful meeting them all again & hearing of the others.  I have been talking today to a chap from the 6th L.H. who is now in the artillery, he told me all about everyone, they are it was indeed good to hear of them.
