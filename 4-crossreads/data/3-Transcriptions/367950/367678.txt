<p>Regimental number implies is one of the original Signallers who joined with me at Enoggera in August 1914 and with the exception of a brief spell at Malta suffering from that common malady of Gallipoli &ndash;dysentry. Has been a "sticker" right through to date. Commonly known throughout the regiment and most of the Brigade as "Jock" Is Scotch by birth but has none of the Scottish accent fairly tall and dark  a middle aged man with iron grey hair and a black moustache, "Jock " is always seen to the best advantage when he had about 3 days growth of thick black bristles then he looks a character indeed. Much respected by all who know him on account of his great stock of sound (typically Scottish)  common sense and his cool judgement and clear headedness (provided it is not too soon after pay day and a canteen handy.) On those occasions "Jock" is possessed with anything but clear headedness. Is a splendid signaller and is a tower of strength on a signal station. A most conscientious worker and obeys implicitly all orders (having previously been a military man he understands the meaning of that mysterious word Dicipline which so few in this army do) I made him a lance Corporal</p>
