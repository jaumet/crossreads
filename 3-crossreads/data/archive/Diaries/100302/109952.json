Stood at the slope for a long time and the men felt the fatigue ? one took a fit and another fainted. I had charge of about 450 men and they gave a good present in the general salute. Was disappointed in Lo/K. His face was bloated and the opens of his nose and cheeks stand out terribly as upon the face of a heavy drinker. His eyes are bleary. He is a fine big man and his service tunic was ablaze with war ribbons. General Monro accompanied him ? and a man with a limp. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We marched past afterwards in fours and to my disgust, missed the salute being past the point without knowing about 5 paces. Fortunately Mackay used his head and gave the order &amp; whipped round &amp; saluted but too late to catch his eye. Cursed myself for being caught napping.
