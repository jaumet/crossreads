<p>Had a very quiet time until about 6 A.M. when they started to come in.  All night long thousands of cavalry were passing.  First tanks went up, a hundred of them and without ceasing the stream continued.  It was an inspiring sight to see such forces going up at speed to the line, all the crack regiments being included.  At 4.30 the stunt started &amp; was wonderfully successful. [The Battle of Amiens] It was a dull misty morning and the surprise was complete.  Exactly which frontage was attacked we do not know but all our Divisions are up, also the Canadians &amp; the Tommies &amp; French are included.  A wonderful effort indeed &amp; a worthy finishing effort to this diary.  Went off duty at 8.30 feeling fit, not being unduly tired.  The whole affair has the Foch touch &amp; our men are as keen as mustard to be in it, although they have had such a long time in the line.</p>
