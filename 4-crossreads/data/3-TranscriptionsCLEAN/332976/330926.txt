  
 September 1917 22nd   The section have been working on the huts again to-day, & I am on picquet to-night, on the material for for them.   The 14th Brigade moved into the line to-night & the 15th Brig. have moved into the huts.   They are going up to-morrow. 23rd   After lunch No 2 & 4 sections moved up to Zillebeke Lake in "battle- order with blankets.   We are quartered in small "dug outs" on the bank of the lake, together with some of the 14th & 15th Brig. infantry.   At 8 P.M., with a 49th Btn. fatigue party the section moved up to Glencourse Wood (captured a few days ago) & made a "mule-track" over the ridge.   At about 2 AM. Fritz put gas over & some heavy shelling followed, but we had no casualties & returned at 4 A.M.
