<p>&amp; Samer are Cavalry headquarters and in practically all the little villages I passed through British cavalry billets could be seen. I saw several Australian Light Horsemen &amp; N.Z. Mounted Rifles although did not visit the Anzac Camp.</p>
<p>Mond. 5th March 1917<br/>Yesterday morning we had a visit from our G.O.C. Lieut. Gen. Birdwood. He is the right kind of Chief for chaps like ours. Is ready to have a yarn to anyone &amp; has quite a genial disposition.</p>
<p>Had a fall of snow last night &amp; when we turned out on 6.15 parade this morning it was coming down thickly.</p>
<p>Thurs. 22nd Mar 1917<br/>Spring is coming. Intermingled with snow, cold, rain &amp; sleet we are now getting sunny hours which are heartily appreciated. The big offensive is being continued vigorously on the 'front' &amp; the Germans are falling back rapidly, leaving numerous villages in our hands after more than two years of occupation.</p>
