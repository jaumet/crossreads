for'ard and I did not linger-longer.  We had 2 Hours at pitch & toss, two-up it is called in the army, & then slid into the Solent.  We anchored off Netley Hospital & gave the Patients their Tea & got the remainder to bed immediately afterwards.  May were sick including several of my Staff but I had busied myself so much over others that I had forgotten to be sick.
I enjoyed a lovely Dinner at 7 pm after posting my fellows to their duties.  I went on the Medical Wards myself from 9 to 11 pm & the others Cpls & men took 2 Hours on all through the night.  I went down to the Sisters Quarters to sleep.  I had a nice bunk on a soft velvet cushion, alone of course.  The Sisters had been sent off for safety, some months previously, when the mines were about.
Next morning we pulled into the Docks at Southampton & at 10.30 disembarked on to a Hospital Train.  We have bread & a basin of soup at 12.30 & at 1 pm left for Tidworth.  History repeated itself for we did exactly the same in September 1916 with this exception that we motored to Park House Camp instead of padding the Hoof.
It was just lovely to get back to "dear old Blighty" after the nasty smells of France & the jabbering on an unintelligible language to most of us.  We arrived at 3 pm & at 10 past 3 I was on Duty again.  At 8 pm I was glad to get to bed.  Ellis arrived about 4.30 pm on the same Day after an awful experience altogether.
That evening Ellis & I scrambled about the Car & went over to see Dick Toppin our Chum at Bulford.  We had a lovely long yarn interesting on both sides although only separated about 21/2 months.  Next evening we went over to get some togs to take back with us, but a dance was being held at the Y.W.C.A. & as we had many Friends there we decided to go, especially as we were informed that we should be returning to Bulford in a couple of days.  We had a beautiful walk over the Hills & downs to camp, the silvery moonlight
