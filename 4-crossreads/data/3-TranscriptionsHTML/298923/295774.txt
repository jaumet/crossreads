<p>18 April 1918 Thursday (X to X crossed out)<br/> Still here, I suppose it is going to be a long war X but I'm impatient to get to Dolly-<br/>Just had to flog a native, not allowed by Kings Regulations but the only way to deal with them.   My horses have benefited by the spell X &amp; I have the two Harry Austin gave me looking very fit they know all about soldiering, &amp; can tell shell fire as well as I can.<br/>X Had to give a native 15 lashes today he saluted afterwards, its their only punishment.
