For the first time we were 'on route' in proper style and so it would be interesting to note what the words 'equipment & pack' connote. The 'equipment' is very similar to that used in the Militia in Australia, & in the pack on the back we put all our necessities; these include, 1 service blanket, 1 waterproof sheet, 1 towel, 1 shirt, 1 singlet, 1 pr underpants, socks (4 prs I took), shaving gear, etc, soap, wash-rag, 'kerchiefs,& cap-comforter.
