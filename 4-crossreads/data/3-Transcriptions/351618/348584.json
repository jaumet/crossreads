<p>sabbath morn after such an angry night. The screaming of shells and the crack crack of rifle fire made a perfect pandemonium. You could not hear yourself speak.</p>
<p>We had to keep a very careful watch in the evening as we expected our Turkish enemy to attack in reply to the previous evening's incident. The expected did not happen.</p>
<p>Monday 2nd August<br/>It was fairly warm today but quiet. Col Hubert Harris who was killed on the evening of the attack on the Turkish position was buried last night. Col Harris who was attached to the 5th Light Horse was well known in Brisbane. The Turkish aeroplane circled above our trenches to-day and there was a rush for cover when several bombs were dropped. Luckily they did no damage.</p>
