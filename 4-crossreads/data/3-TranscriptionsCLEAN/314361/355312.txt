  
 on slippers, for the slippers they make a charge of 1/2 pt. The mosque inside is beautiful especially the roof which is domed, one big dome in centre & a couple of smaller ones. All the roof is inlaid with gold & enamel & is quite a work of art. There are hundreds of lamps suspended from the roof, the floor is covered with carpet, red with a brown design. In the mosque there is the coffin & tomb of Mohamed Ali. I tried to take a photo of the interior. After coming out of the mosque, I went to some ruined place & went up a tower, by a narrow winding staircase, from the top I had a grand view of the city with Pyramids of Le Cairo in the distance. I also took a few photos from this place. The citadel at one time must have been a magnificent place & the cost must have been enormous. All the interior of the mosque was of marble & alabaster & the roof inlaid with gold.
