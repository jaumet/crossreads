Jan 19th  We had another death aboard. a sergeant. the ship slowed up at 11.A.M. & a service held & the body lowered overboard to the accompaniment of the last post on the bugle. Tom honed a razor for me & did it well. we played the old cards again in the evening. I slept on the hatch.
 
Jan 20th  Our gun was fired a couple of times for practice & we also had a boat alarm practice -
 
Jan 21st  Sunday - weather warm & fine I take on mess orderly duties for a week with Tom.
 
Jan 22nd  Weather warm & sea calm - all the clothing that is worn by most of us is a pr of shorts & sometimes a singlet & sometimes not. We put on the gloves on our own deck for a bit of exercise.  found it very strenuous.
 
Jan 23rd  It gets warmer every day now & the sea remains smooth - I went down to the stoke hold & put in three quarters of an hour coal trimming. had a hot bath & a shower when I came up  played cards in the evening
