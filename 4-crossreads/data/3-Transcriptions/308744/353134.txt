<p>Our troops withdrew to the West Bank of the JORDON on April 2nd. The raid had resulted in several miles of the railway South of AMMAN being destroyed, but the viaduct remained intact, we having failed to penetrate that far.</p>
<p>In the course of the operation, Medical Stores were dropped from the air on our advanced troops. This was rendered necessary owing to the fact that all roads and tracks became impassable for wheeled traffic after the heavy rains. The only means available for the transport of these supplies was on pack camels &ndash; a slow tedious process.</p>
<p>APRIL:   During April our machines kept a diligent watch over the enemy East of the JORDON, where interest was still chiefly centered.  Altogether 47 strategical reconnaissances were carried out, of which 29 were  of the country between DAMIN, AMMAN and SHUNET NIMRIN.  Several important series of photographs of roads, caravan routes and tracks in area were completed. They were required for mapping purposes in connection with a plan for further operations here.  These maps were subsequently published and used for the operations against ES SALT, which commenced on April 30th. Altogether 23 photographic reconnaissances were carried out, 609 plates exposed, and 5,397 prints produced.</p>
<p>Up till this period hostile aircraft patrols had been carried out by No.111 Squadron, R.F.C. on an intermittent system, and when our troops concentrated in the JORDON VALLEY, enemy machines succeeded in dashing over our lines on one or two occasions during the interval between these patrols, when they bombed the Light Horse. To guard against a recurrence of this, arrangements were made for a continuous patrol throughout the day over this area. 1st Squadron performed a share of this work, carrying out 27 patrols during the month in addition to the usual reconnaissances. The patrols were from 2&frac12; to 3 hours duration.</p>
<p>Escorts, consisting of two or three Bristol Fighters were supplied on four occasions during the month, when machines from R.A.F. Squadrons bombed AMMAN Station. No bomb raids were carried out by this unit.</p>
<p>While on a reconnaissance near KALKILIEM on the 15th, Lieut, G.C. Peters and Lieut. R.S. Adair (pilots) and Lieuts. J.H. Traill and R.A. Camm (Observers) attacked 3 Albatross Scouts, two of which they shot down. When on similar duty over NABLUS 28th., Lieut. E.P. Kenny (pilot) and Lieut. F.C. Hawley (Observer) were attacked by 4 Albatross Scouts, one of which they shot down in flames, while a second enemy machine was driven down and crashed on landing. The remaining two enemy aircraft broke off the engagement.</p>
<p>On April 30th, operations were commenced against ES SALT.</p>
<p>The development of this attack attracted chief attention during the first days in May. The motive behind this operation was the seizure of ES SALT, which was to be held with the object of encircling the enemy force at SHUNET NIMRIN, which since the former raid had increased from 3,000 to 8,000 rifles. This was to be effected with the aid of the Beni Sakr tribe who were reported to be concentrated at MADEBA.  Unfortunately, however, this assistance was not forthcoming, with the result that the plan failed. Indeed, at one stage of the operations, certain of our forces found themselves in a most precarious position. The 60th division was held up at SHUNET NIMRIN, where they suffered heavy casualties, while an Australian Light Horse Brigade left to guard the left flank was cut off by Turkish cavalry who crossed the JORDAN at DAMIE during the night. The mounted force which was entered ES SALT were also in a serious position, being heavily attacked by troops brought up from AMMAN. Effective aerial co-operation went a long way towards enabling these forces to extricate themselves from this ugly situation. Our machines attacked the enemy from low altitudes with bombs and machines gun fire, harassing him considerably in his movements and inflicting heavy casualties. All available machines were employed in this way and these attacks proved extremely hopeful in</p>
