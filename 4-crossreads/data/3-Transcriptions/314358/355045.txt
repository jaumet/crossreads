<p>5<br/>In orders I find this will be the last mail from here to be in time for Xmas.<br/>Often have I thought of writing a book "My Xmas Days"<br/>Mine have been spent in strange concerns under various conditions<br/>"Books which never were written" will be perhaps my only book and that an empty cover.</p>
<p>Don't lose my old writings for I want to rewrite everything which is good when I come back dear</p>
<p>Xmas greetings to you all my wife</p>
<p>After next pay I shall send some Egyptian things to you all</p>
<p>At present my love is all that I can send before Xmas.</p>
<p>I am in the land where the first Xmas began The sunset tonight was a Bible picture.</p>
<p>There is so much to speak of. To me this place is still the edge of a vast dream</p>
