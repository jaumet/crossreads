cook house wood chopping fatigue, but so far I have not over-worked, although after soft work for 4 1/2 mths., the slightest exertion is hard.Some say Lewes near Brighton is our objective, & some Weymouth.  Those of purely guesswork I consider, but a French chap in our tent, who is rather a smart man intellectually was told by the D.M.S. that those not detailed will most certainly go to England & wait for orders to proceed to France.  At no time since leaving Aust. have the chances of a trip to England been more bright.
