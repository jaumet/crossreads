they, especially the Colonel are so witty & smart but then sometimes I'm glad you're not.  They are still witty &c. but with a difference.  I thought I was pretty hardened but I find I can still be made to gasp.
Well to return to your epistle, referring to your letter from "Burrabogie", I'm afraid you weren't on your best behaviour there.  Its quite time I came back that is if I am any restraining influence which I doubt.  But I'm hoping that your new found vocation will do a lot for you.
I'm glad its going on well & that you find its a refuge & a solace.  But my word you'll have to grind.  You should do all right.
Oh Stuart sent me two snaps, one of Graham & Lerida & one of them blowing bubbles.  He is dear kid & how like the Boss.
By the way I wrote the Boss & very next day got another from him.  He's a brick & please tell him so.  I hope it won't offend him if I tell him his letters are extremely funny.  I chuckle & giggle.
I have no news my dear, things are rather slow,
