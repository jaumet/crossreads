We left camp about 1,15 pm. the show starting 2.15 it was not so bad, including a few pictures.Popernighe is not much of a place the few main streets are full of motor traffic & crowds of soldiers, there are a good many shops & you can get almost anything required there. The estaminets here have queer names, I came across one in Pop. called "Ye Old Blood Tub."
