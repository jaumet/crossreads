<p>and simply said the Huns would probably "bite off more than they could chew" &amp; that they would "get more than they gave"</p>
<p>When leaving the "Aussies" wished the "Tommies" the best of luck &amp; hoped their optimistic view would prove "right". However when these same "Aussies" inquired of A Coy men if they noticed or heard how these two naval guns had "got on", they were informed that one of them had been put out of action some time before A. Coy men passed them, on their march back to Coy Headquarters, and it certainly looked as if the other would go too unless removed out of danger. It must be moved to another "posie" &amp; hidden, to save it for the Huns had the range &amp; knew it was there.</p>
<p>The march back was continued and eventually the "Aid post" was reached, &amp; the Sergt reported to the Doctor, the condition of all four men &amp; that they proposed going on to the Battalion base at Fremicourt, as he was very busy as it was.</p>
<p>The march was continued &amp; after more "dreary" walking the base was reached about six oclock in the evening.</p>
<p>Immediately all the men, not in action, Cooks, Ration parties, &amp; Quarter masters fatigue men gathered round keenly interested on hearing a detailed description of the work done &amp; were sorry to hear of those who had "gone west" reported "missing" &amp; wounded.</p>
<p>Of course the minutest details of the "accidents" to any pals amongst them had to be given very fully.</p>
<p>Owing to the Sergt not having "produced" the men suffering from bad feet, to the Doctor &amp; having only verbally reported to him, those men were not allowed to go in the Ambulances to Hospital &amp; would therefore have to wait till the Doctor could leave the Aid post to come back to the base which meant a delay of 3 or 4 days before they could be attended to.</p>
