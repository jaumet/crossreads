Then went to Gamages &amp; bought razor strop &amp; a hone. Brought them back to lodging then went down Shaftesbury Avenue &amp;  bought chocolates for Ida and Auntie in Barrow.  Then went via Leicester Square &amp; Trafalgar Sq to the Strand to a cafe near Charing Cross Stn &amp; had a good dinner of grilled steak &amp; potatoes &amp; cabbage. After dinner went along the Strand to Australia House to see the building. It is a good building really going to waste to my idea. 
 Then came back to Trafalgar Square &amp; got No 15 Bus to Paddington via Piccadilly, Regent St, Oxford St, Edgware Rd &amp; Praed St. Had look round Paddington Stn then took bus to Victoria Stn via Praed St, Edgware Rd, Marble Arch, Park Lane &amp; Grosvenor Place to Victoria St. After seeing station there walked to Horseferry Rd enquired about the morning sick parade, then walked along Victoria St &amp; Whitehall to Trafalgar Sq &amp; the Strand.
