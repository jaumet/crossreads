<p>Jerrom and I left Alexandria and came via Mudros to Anzac. You have had account <strike>of</strike> from me till the time of my posting a letter about Wednesday last. We landed on Anzac beach about 1 A.M. on Saturday the 16th inst. Fortunately there was on board packet from Mudros a Doctor Carlisle whom I knew. He was kind, and taking Jerom and me under his protecting wing he found us a place wherein to sleep for the night, taking us to the 1st Casualty hospital for breakfast in the morning, we both have been quartered there since as guests to Lt. Col. Gordon, a doctor from Melbourne.<br/>I did not know if there would be work here for me to perform. On reporting to Col. Howse he told me that there was nothing suitable for me. I then arranged that I was to stay for a week or so to look round. I have been so doing in the interval.<br/>Each day I have found some pal of old acquaintance in or near Sydney and with him I have tramped the trenches, gone into the firing lines, looked over the parapets at the Turks and their defences not fifty and more yards away, have surveyed the country towards the point of the Galipoli Peninsula, over Gaba Tepe, Sedel Bar ridge stretching from the Dardanels to the Aegean Sea, <strike>at</strike> the mountains in Asia, and to the North the highlands of European Turkey. From where I sit in a dug-out writing, I see to the West the island Imbros, somewhat to the North of it Samothrace, and more to the North that part of Bulgaria which fronts the Aegean Sea,</p>
