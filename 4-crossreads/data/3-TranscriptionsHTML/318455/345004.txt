<p>April <strike>12</strike> 11 (I think)<br/>I had to take my chestnut mare down to the Mobile Vet. Section. She was bombed at Dickebush last october &amp; a splinter of iron had worked up to the surface &amp; set up a big swelling that had to be lanced. So yesterday afternoon I had to set out to the Company at St Leger &amp; get another horse &amp; arrived back this morning at 10 am. to find everyone loading up for a move It is now <strike>3 p.m.</strike> 4 p.m. &amp; we are to move off in an hour</p>
