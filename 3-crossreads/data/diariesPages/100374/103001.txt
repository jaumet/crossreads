Wounded men came pouring in to-day. We had to work under the most awful disadvantages There are so many draughts in the place that we cannot keep the primus stoves going they are continually flaming up.

If there is such a thing as being annoyed on Active Service there is good grounds for being so in this place.

Aug 4th. Thurs

Things have slackened off a bit and we were able to re-arrange things. This latest rush was the most awful mix up of an affair that I have ever been in.

Additional staff has arrived from a R.A.M.C. from Hazebrouck The town had been bombarded the day after we left it and they had to close down their station

A very large number of Gas Cases arrived to-night. A new gas seems to be being used. Mustard Gas it is called, it burns the patient as well as acts on the lungs. It does not seem to act straight away. It acts a few hours after the patient has been affected

Our sleeping quarters are awful at present, they are crowded, chatty and green mouldy.
