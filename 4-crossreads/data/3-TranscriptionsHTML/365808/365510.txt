<p>The surroundings are delightful. It is my first experience of Cambridge and I am charmed with the colleges, courts, lawns &amp; river scenery. So far I have managed to wander over a few of the older colleges. But we have not a great deal of time off.<br/>It was rather a blow having to slip off from the Division just now, but things wont be over for a bit yet. With kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; yourself.<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>Walter Macallen</p>
