Australian they say "Hullo Australia, how are you"  The King is going to church at Westminster Abbey next Sunday, so I am going to try to get a seat and see the royal church proceedings.  Oh another thing of interest I saw, was Cleopatras needle, the one brought over from Egypt some years ago, it is now situated on the embankment of the Thames. Really mother I must not write any more tonight. Mrs Cust is waiting for me to have something to eat before going off to bed. She is such a dear woman and is good to me, I think I told you that she is an Australian, but has been over here with her husband for nearly 20 years .Will write again quite soon.With best and fondest love to you and dad and all the familyYour loving SonGordon
