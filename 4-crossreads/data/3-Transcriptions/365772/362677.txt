<p>"Abduls Country" Gallipoli<br/>7.11.15<br/>My dearest Sister,<br/>Two more letters &amp; a card for my birthday to hand today from you, I dont think you have missed a mail to me yet. I think I told you that I got over 50 letters in one go from the Base since returning from Egypt. I tell you they took reading too anyway it will be satisfaction for you to know that your letters were not lost altogether as we thought.<br/>Our holiday at Lemnos is over &amp; we are all back at the big disturbance again. You were talking about at least writing about promotion for me, they made me a Lance Sergt sraight away on returning &amp; now am full Sergeant &amp; Platoon Sergeant &amp; if I hang on &amp; dont get knocked will get a commission before long. I stand very well with the old officers of the original Battalion, but our Coy Commander is a young reinforcement officer &amp; is not much class as a CO &amp; we old NCO's brawl a treat with him especially yours truly &amp; the Sergeant Major another old hand. This officer was a counter jumper at Grace Bros &amp; now by gum he swanks gives me a pain. Now dont get alarmed when I tell you but I am writing this in one of our field hospitals I have a slight touch of influenza &amp; here we have stretchers to lay on &amp; good food, the tucker in this "dugout" is 100% better than the food I ever received while away wounded in Egypt. I only came in this moming &amp; for dinner had 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bowls of lovely hot soup</p>
