<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>This is answer to your letters of 7 Oct.  You will know ere this that we have received your three parcels.  I posted your X'mas Cards to England this morning.  I also trust that it will be the last X'mas away from Home.  We have not received any papers for some time so I should stop sending any more Papers, Dad.  I hope that Tommy Adams gets his eyes quite restored to their normal state.  We anticipate a good time at X'mas.  I fortunately met an Australian Girl from South Australia &amp; she is like Win Cocks both in features &amp; ways, so as she has other Friends who work with the Y.M.C.A.</p>
