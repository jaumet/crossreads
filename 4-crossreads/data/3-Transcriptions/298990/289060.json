<p>Buire&ndash; sur-Ancre.  Picardy 2/11/16 A wet day.  Stayed inside all the morning and took down a summary of evidence in the case of Rhoden. Furphey today we move to Fricourt tomorrow.  After lunch took the Battalion right out to open ground on the top of a rise a couple of miles out.  Carried on with physical exercises and bayonet work followed by close order drill. Men very keen.  Weather cleared up and wind dropped.  Dozens of our aeroplanes up manoeuvring around and plenty of sausage balloons up both on our own and on the French front.  Espied the white caps of two nurses in the distance so the Colonel and self rode round the hill and cut them off and asked them if they had seen any troops drilling round there. Stayed and talked to them for a while - nice girls. Formed up in mass and marched home.  View from here is very extensive and on all the ridges are scores of white bell tents.  Some are hospitals but most are camps of troops.  In the valleys lie the little snug villages swollen out with military additions.  Mud and water everywhere.  The men all very keen on their work as they always are when there is anything doing.  It is pathetic to think that all the keen lads we took in last time are all out of it now and replaced by these young novitiates , most of them fine big men.  The largest are in "B" Co and the smallest in "D" Co.  Conference of officers in evening.</p>
