<p>going. I don't there have been more than 300 patients in hospital at one time since we took over 7 weeks ago (79)<br/>Thursday 18 May<br/>Yesterday evening I went over the "pont transborderer" a great iron framework  stretching across the entrance to the "Vieux Port" and towering high above the water. A lift takes you up 52 m&egrave;tres but a ladder can be climbed until an altitude of 74 m&egrave;tres is reached. A magnificent view is obtainable from the top &ndash; over the busy city  with the mountains in the background, and across the harbour with its Casino &amp; shipping. After going down the lift again, I crossed to the other side by a pontoon affair suspended by chains from the framework, which runs too &amp; fro for passenger &amp; vehicular traffic. Went back to camp after</p>
