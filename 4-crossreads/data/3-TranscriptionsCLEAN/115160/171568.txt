 It has been possible for my father to go back in his native land: the village in which I inhabited before the war has received some shells.  The german have taken off all furniture.  Only the four walls and the roof [indescipherable]. As my father is a notary, he had many papers; the Germans have taken off these papers also. 
 At this time, there are many american soldiers in the country. 
 I hope that, before going back in Australia, you shall come at Paris. 
 I expect your letter patiently. 
 Yours faithfully, 
 Your friend 
 Jean Watelet
