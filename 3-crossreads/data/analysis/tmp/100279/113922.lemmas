 ground form a horribl coverlet of moistur upon everyth , rifl are too clammi to touch , the enemi is invis as a rule through the cloud of vapour , but he is unlik to attack while the battlefield is a quagmir , a bayonet charg would be clog after the first jump to the parapet , it would be almost an imposs to bring up artilleri , so you may guess it will be stick in the mud warfar for some time yet but it is far from rest for shrapnel is mix plenti with the raindrop . We put in anoth veri cold night in fact we near perish for everyth we had on was wet through I can tell you no one was more glad than myself when daylight came with it some hot tea .
