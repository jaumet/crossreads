Sunday 28th Nov 1915
Visited with snowstorm early hours of morning. Still falling when I awoke. Whole of the country under a mantle of white. Fall judged to be about 4 inches. Am frightfully sick myself, with overpowering nausea no appetite. Absolutely unfit for duty. My back also is worrying me. Have been to complain for last two days. With the traffic, there was soon mud everywhere. I have never seen such slosh ? its absolutely impossible to get through it ? slide, slip, slither all over the place, if you are luck enough not to get stuck in it ankle deep.

APMS has now sent me to N.Z. Field Amb. Attention good, but food poor ill-cooked.

Spent a comfortable night - first sleep for a week ? left about 4 a.m. for Mudros where we arrived in due course. Have no idea of my ultimate destination. Had Enjoyed the luxury of a hot sea bath had my clothes thoroughly disinfected. 
Am feeling none too bright.
Left Mudros about 2 o'clock for Alexandria.
