<p>31.5.15<br/>Mon. 31st.  The warships were booming all night further back, but the attack we expected did not come off &amp; things were very quiet here all night.  A few bombs were exchanged between our boys &amp; the Turks on Quinns Post during the night but that was about all.  I had no sleep last night but managed to get 3 hours this morning in the trench.  At 3.30 p.m. one of our aeroplanes flew over us &amp; the Turks must have fired 20 shrapnel shells at her but they all failed to hit her.  Yesterday both flanks advanced, New Zealanders on our left &amp; Aust. on the right &amp; have managed to hold the ground they took.  Our torpedo boat destroyers appear pretty busy this afternoon, probably scouting for submarines.  We were relieved from the trenches soon after 4 oclock &amp; were soon after into dug-outs close by on the side of the hill.</p>
