 Our chaps went out on the lines again last night. Thank goodness this is the last night for a while anyway. They fixed up communication once again & for a wonder all lines are holding. This morning I went out side & found the snow falling very fast in large flakes. The ground everywhere white & even walking about showed up very plainly. Everybody has grown a beard or a moustache & as very few brought towels & the water being frozen almost every morning most of us could do with a good wash, to say nothing of a clean change of clothing.
