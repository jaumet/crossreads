Sunday 25 February 1917
Arrived at ZEITOUN, mixed crowd of English & other officers.
I took the shoes off my horses to give their feet a spell while I'm away. On the old Camel lines on the Desert a small quantity of grain, Barley & LENTILS have grown up from the waste feed & my man grazes the horses here, both are fat & doing well.
