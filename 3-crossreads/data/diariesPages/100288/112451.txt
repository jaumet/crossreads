Pitched a few tents, then rested the remainder of the day. Turned very cool towards evening.
Wednesday 5/4/16
Cooks fatigue for the day. Much cooler than usual. Hospital tents pitched commenced to take in Brigade sick. Dysentery rather prevalent among the troops camping here; water apparently the cause.
Thursday 6/4/16
Rather warm again. Very little work carried out here during the middle of the day owing to the heat. Flies very troublesome. Walked across to roadhead about 1 miles
