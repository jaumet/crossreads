<p>Flanders<br/>3.9.16.<br/>We have left the Somme and come up North again and are now stationed in a camp, bearing a Canadian name, just off the long white road which runs from Ypres to Poperinghe.  Here the Canadians made their name in the second and Third Battles of Ypres here their names have been immortalised and everything bears <strike>a Canadian name</strike> it.  We are just moving into the line at Hill 60, the famous hill a little to the left of Verbrandmolen which has been the scene of the greatest mining activity throughout the war.  Day and night the miners, both ours and the Huns, work incessantly counter-mining, blowing in each others shafts, establishing listening-posts, working always.  The whole area is a labrynth of underground passages.  Above the infantry manning the trenches</p>
