  
 Dr Copplesom & Dr Minty, I consider deserve special mention for the way they stuck to their post. Lots of the Infantry who used to say Field Ambulance men were cold footed now have a different tale to tell, they said we must have charmed lives. I only got two little scratches from shrapnel - & 4 Bearers were wounded. I consider no men could do justice to ghastly sights behind our parapets yesterday - the Chaos - the dead in different attitudes, the wounded perhaps only distinguished by the moaning - the nerve broken soldier trying to do his duty at his post, with dead all around them - it will be a night mare to me for all times. As near as we can estimate we have since Wednesday midday till Friday midday treated nearly  3,400  cases The majority of these were carried in. We hear rumours that the total casualties run to 5,000. One very fine feature of the evacuation of wounded after us dressing them, was a splendid service of 
 official figures later given 8,340 total casualtys
