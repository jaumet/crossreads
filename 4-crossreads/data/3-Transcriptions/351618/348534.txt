<p>were very quiet. Roads had been made. Larger dugouts etc and our front was just like a Township. This waiting for me is certainly very trying. The heat and flies are very bad in comparison with when I left. Our engineers and Infantry had done a lot of sapping and making a fresh line of trenches in front etc.</p>
<p>Went for swim on beach. Had to go in from Battery on swimming [Indecipherable]. There is a sniper doing a lot of damage along the beach. As we left our gully for the only portion we are now allowed to swim in one poor chap was shot just a few yards in front of me. Enjoyed swim and returned once more to gun pit. Our Battery does not get relieved as promised.</p>
<p>We have speaking tubes from one gun to another &amp; a canteen abt to be opened I understand on</p>
