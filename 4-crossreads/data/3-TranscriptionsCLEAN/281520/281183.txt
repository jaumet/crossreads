Bapaume4/4/17The cellar was dark and for all its lousiness the bunk was so comfortable that it was 11.30 before turning out time.  Got up rather hurriedly on realising this, and going out side found a fairly heavy snowstorm in progress.  Round to the Town Major for lunch first calling on the BM 12th Bde and found that arrangements for the tents were under weigh.  After lunch shifted all gear to the Hospice and got a fire going there in a little room covered with religious pictures and with only one leak in the roof.
Sent orderly to Canteen and got 10 francs worth of eatables.  Someone came into our billet later in the night and stole all these.  Went down to the Canadians after tea and with their O.C. inspected camp site.  Their custom of calling "tea" supper and "guessing" seem strange.  On the ground met Groves and party and 3 motor lorries of tents  Carted these on to the ground and put a few up.  A camp fire boiled a dixie.  "Percy" spoke frequently today and put one shell right into the yard of the station.  A peppering with clods was my worst damage.  Returned to billets and he blew up the place next door
