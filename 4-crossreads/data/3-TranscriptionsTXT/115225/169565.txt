he was with 10th battery - We got back to park at 7.30 P.M.
 
May 20th  We went to Ailly-S.S. for petrol & oil for the park, Doc. came with us to get it & coming back we had a few drinks of point blank. Doc & Frank had a drop too much with the result that I took the load off whilst Frank propounded to Doc on the subject of a corporal lending a hand when there was no need. We went down & had a swim in the Somme at noon, the water was cold & the stream swift -
 
May 21st  We went out on Supplies to Ailly.S.S. & Frechencourt. We generally stopped at Mme Bully Beef's Joint in the Boulevard in Amiens for a drink - lovely day, We had a swim down in a pool near the river it forms a backwater & was a nice depth for diving & quite big enough for a decent swim - several Fritz planes came over late in the evening with bombs & dropped them about two kilometres nea away.
 
May 22nd  We went two trips to Ailly-S.S. for Petrol etc for the Park & then went to Amiens & took three loads of furniture
