<p>about 7 miles rather severe with heavy packs,  arrived at our destination about 4 p.m. A section are billeted in an old barn, very comfortable sleeping on the straw. Unfortunately for the next 3 days it rained heavily, making things very unpleasant. The country we passed through in the train was delightful to look upon. Sometimes high wide-spreading trees lined the way &amp; picturesque villages dotted the land. At places the path ran through meadows with thousands of poppies on either side.</p>
