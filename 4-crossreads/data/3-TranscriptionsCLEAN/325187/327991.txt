 Off Channel Islands Wireless instructions to go to Portland not Southampton (Cold better) Reason given submarines had missed course- many sweepers & Torpedoe boats are ahead of us-   Left Portland at 3.30 pm with a White Star boat for Southampton so appears we will not now disembark.[indecipherable] We all expected to land at Portland .
