 1916&nbsp;&nbsp; THURSDAY 20&nbsp;&nbsp; JULY 
 Another nice warm day. Helio signalling all day. I got a couple of letters from Mother to say she would come down to Salisbury if I wanted her too, but as I get leave on Monday I  did not as  wired her not to come. The 27 th &nbsp;Battery went on duty. I was detailed as incinerator man.
