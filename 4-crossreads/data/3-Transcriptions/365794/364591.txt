<p>Monday 9 [8] July 1917 [1918]<br/>&frac12; day &amp; Girty &amp; I after 4 p.m. tea at A.S.C. with Frank Blundell now secretary there - Cpl. Shaw &amp; Frank Cullen, go on the Nile with last named two &amp; lovely afternoon &amp; laughter &amp; fun, the old Nile is flooding again &amp; I take the tiller &amp; steer across &amp; across, what tune, the old Solomon of the one eye as sunset comes on, plays &amp; falls on his face with his back to the sunset &amp; facing Mecca.  Evening light is very good &amp; we drive to 31st 8.30 p.m. &amp; dodge dinner.  Long lecture with both lunches on our evil deeds, immorality, etc.  "If we only knew what things are said about us", etc.  What do the things matter when the glorious evening light floods the sky &amp; the soft fresh breeze blows softly in our windows every morning.</p>
