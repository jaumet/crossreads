I reported at the M.G. Co. office at 7 am this morning for instructions and I am to meet others who are going to the school at Romsey at Amesbury Railway Station at 2.15 p.m.<br/>I walked into the station and carried my kit bag and blankets &amp; waterproof sheet. At 2.15 we boarded the train for Salisbury passing Porton on the way, arriving at Salisbury about 3 O'clock. Here we changed trains. At 3.15 we took a train (3rd. class carriage) for Romsey. From Amesbury to Salisbury our carriage was second class which is almost a good as the Victorian first. We passed several little villages and arrived at Romsey about 4 O'clock. We put our luggage in the wagonette and marched out to the camp which is about 2 miles from the town. Romsey is very much larger than Amesbury and is more compact but like all old places in England</p>
