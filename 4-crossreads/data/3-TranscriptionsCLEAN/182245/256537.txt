 1917 JANUARY 
 22 MONDAY 
 Fine & cold. Saw the sun 
 for a few minutes in the 
 afternoon, but no warmth 
 in it at all. Went for a bath 
 in the morning & we had 
 a good hot swim in some 
 old wine vats about two 
 miles away. Exercising 
 horses all the afternoon. 
 Saw Joe Clonan in morning 
 & he looks A1. Got a letter 
 from Linda & Marj.
