<p>6. 10.16<br/>Wright &amp; I were lucky enough to catch a donkey each &amp; the first tram had dinner at the French Restaurant put in the afternoon walking the streets &amp; at 8 oclock met Jock Edwards (a friend of Bains) who was doing things in style as he has a motor car engaged for the day. we put in the rest of the night feasting &amp; driving about in the car at 10.30 we dropped Edwards (who is staying the night in town) &amp; broke records in getting back to Camp the road is perfect &amp; as there was no traffic we had a clear run &amp; cut the 8 miles out in 18 minutes, before dismissing the car we arranged for him to be here in Camp</p>
