for the fourth time to take a leadership; this time on the unpopular side.  The question was: "Should we adopt a policy of reprisals ?"  & my side the negative.Gray, who was with me at Gallipoli (& is also on draft with me) took the a support on my side, & my opponent was my friend Sgt Clerke.With a strong man & popular opinion against me I stood no chance, but Clerke thinks my first speech splendid, & I think myself that I put up a strong fight for it.  Anyhow I like fighting a losing battle & it is real experience to keep the audience quiet.
