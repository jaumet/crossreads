13/4/19MarcinelleChurch parade at 10.30 a.m. was poorly attended and a wretched farce. The officers &amp; men only go under compulsion &amp; we find that voluntary parades fail. At 1.30 a draft of 70 men paraded in the Square to be seen off by me. I spoke the usual few words and then Band at head they marched off to report at the Divisional Reinf. Wing.  In the evening went to "La Traviata" with Gorman &ndash; a fairly good show but weak orchestra &amp; a bad mannered audience. Entre actes the usual mingling of the sexes insanitarily. To Caf&eacute; Central full of officers and some evil looking ugly girls dancing. Prostitution in an ugly industrial town like Charleroi is a nakedly ugly thing.
