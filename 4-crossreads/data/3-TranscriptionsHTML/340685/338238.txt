<p>and told there would be a football match at 2 with the second company. Watched the match which they won by about 7 to 1 goals. After tea went with Ludlow into Watten and walked round until 8 and home at 8.15. Very cold and frosty again and we are to move to-morrow. Reveille at 5.45 and transport leaves at 7.30 and we later to board a train. Don't know destination. Irvine &amp; Linton at St Omer again to-night. Got orders to-night to move at 9.30 and the transport at 7.<br/>21.10.16 Reveille at 5.45 so we got up in the cold and after stacking blankets had breakfast. Another biting frost. Waited about until 10 and had some hot coffee and started at 10 up through the wood &amp; right through to Polincove where we stopped for dinner and a drink at 12.20. <strike>This place</strike> On to Audruick which looks as if it had been bombarded at sometime and is a big ammunition depot. We boarded the train on which part of our transport had been loaded by 3 &amp; 4 and set off immediately passing round to Calais at 2. Saw the channel and the town. On to Boulogne where we saw some Australian nurses who displayed the flag to us as we cheered. it looked as if we were to go to Blighty but we were disappointed and after seeing the Harbour we went on through Etaples and on to Abbeville and then to Pont-Remy where we disentrained. Fairly comfortable journey in 3rd carriages. Arrived at 9.30 and had to wait about in the cold until 10.30 for our transport to be unloaded and then came on without it to Francieres about 5 miles out. We waited about in the cold for 45 minutes while the Major hunted for billets and then went in and had to wait for our waggons. 1.30. It was bitterly cold and we couldn't sleep and the transport got lost <strike>so</strike> and only arrived at 2.45 so we got comfortable and slept dead tired.<br/>22.10.16 Awakened at 6 and had to go down and try out No 1 pontoon in the frosty cold and had breakfast a8. Got some apples and drinks and got things shipshape and then wrote this up and rested until dinner. This place is called Francieres. In the afternoon I intended to go on the bike with Irvine to Pont-Remy but he &amp; Linton and some others collared the bike before dinner and cleared out &amp;  went to Ailly &amp;  Abbeville so in the cold I played football</p>
