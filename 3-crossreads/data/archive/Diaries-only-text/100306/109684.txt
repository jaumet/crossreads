Shelter Wood Camp
4/2/17 Stayed in huts all day. In morning assembled all the O.C. Coys and despatched them up to see their sectors. Cull went to hospital today suspected diphtheria. Heavy cannonade close on our Left and rumour that the neighbouring Divisions hopped the bags last night. Miller Bde. Bomb officer says this Div. is also doing a stunt at 3 am on 5/2/17. Worked out available men and chatted B.M. to get some of our fatigues released to join us up. A fine cold day with some tendency to thaw but evening was a real frost. Fuller came in to see me during the afternoon and recalled old times. Put the weights into two men for burning good floor boards in their brazier. Thought of letting them off as they were dinkum Billjims but one has to be hard and their punishment will be an example to their other 20 hut comrades. Owing to bad weather lack of razors and intense cold some men are letting themselves get very dirty and have to be checked. They like washing their feet in the warm water we provide under the supervision of our A.M.C. details Slang word "sniping" meaning to pinch
