Such was the scheme that was announced to the batta company commanders later that night, & from the outset all realised what a difficult task it was. The town was practically surrounded by wide swamps & the rivers Somme & Cologne, with elaborate branch systems & barbed wire entanglements behind them [insertion written vertically in left-hand margin:] and High hills to the rear with artillery positions & direct observation on all crossings.
Well No wonder that it had proved such an effective barrier before the Hun retreat of 1917.
