<p>Sgt Clerke went up with me &amp; had tea with us at Barnes on the first afternoon, &amp; spent the evening with us.  Lily enjoyed herself immensely, although we did nothing but talk the whole evening.<br/>The following day Lily &amp; I went to an exhibition at the Imperial Institute, South Kensington, &amp; paid particular attention to the colonial &amp; Indian part of it.  Unfortunately we were not full up with cash, so had to manoeuvre a bit: as a result, however, it was more enjoyable than ever&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    for it was funny &amp; interesting to study the menu out in finding the cheapest way to get a feed.</p>
