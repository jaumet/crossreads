 Gallipoli Penin 21.8.1915 
 Dear Father &amp; Mother In haste &ndash; an attack just commencing so I have only a few moments &ndash; mail closing tonight. Father's letter of 28/6/15 and Mother's of 14 &amp; 28/6/15 to hand. Am keeping very fit so don't worry Mum about my togs etc. Am just wondering whether we are to winter here. Hope not. Had a letter from Sis yesterday, written 18/7/15, the day after they arrived in Exeter. They were all well and seemed to be well pleased with their new surroundings which is half the battle. Must stop. Fondest love to selves and Pat from Your affectate Son Terence
