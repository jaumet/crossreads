<p>7.11.15<br/>Sun 7th<br/>Asked Major Granville this morning if C Sqd Sig's could miss the coming spell to Lemnos as the 3 of us would rather stay here, or was it compulsory to go: (The Regt is to go a third at the time &amp; 2 thirds to remain on duty here: taking turn about spelling). The Major said he would see &amp; that a big percentage of Sigs would have to remain in any case to keep up the communication so we stand a good chance of staying here, I think we would have a good chance of striking rougher times at Lemnos than we have here &amp; I am quite contented with my job here  MacGhee was wounded through the hip while at the incinerator soon after dinner; it is marvellous how unconcerned a man seems when he is hit, when MacGhee was hit he just fell &amp;</p>
