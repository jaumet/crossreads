<p>into our doings &amp; photographing.</p>
<p>I went with Joyce &amp; Wilkins on an ambulance lorry to the Hooge crater, &amp; had considerable excitement on account of the Boche shelling the road. Afterwards we went through the infamous Chateau Wood &amp; up the enfiladed road to Westhock Ridge. This region always suffers heavy shelling &amp; we passed through nearly a mile of straffed limbers &amp; waggons &amp; dead horses. I have not seen a more terrible scene of desolation, waste &amp; destruction than hereabouts on Westhock. The Boche observation on his area is superb, &amp; the least congestion invariably brings shelling.  We returned over the duckboards by a safer route to Hellfire Corner, &amp; thence on to Ypres. A fine sunset beautified these solemn ruins, that awakened feelings of awe &amp; made one sorrow for the things which war has done. Took 18 plates.</p>
