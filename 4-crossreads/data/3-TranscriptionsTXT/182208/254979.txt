 Dear Arch, Lynda and Children 
 By the time you get this letter I will be well into some of those squareheaded - or in some Hospital, bear in mind I&#39;m mot going to Pati, I tell you to look forward to seeing me in a couple of years time. 
 It just reminds me, when Lord Nelson sailed the Fleet up the channell for seven years until the men were hardened and fierce, well we are doing the same, I tell you it&#39;s very trying but nevertheless I take it all in the best of Spirits and not at all down hearted, there&#39;s snow a foot thick now and the tucker is not the best, that bit of traning (silent traning) I had come&#39;s in very handy, you remember it, 3 weeks on frozen milk and Pork (Frity?)&nbsp;I tell you I often wish I had some more of those &quot;Gallipoli&quot; sausages
