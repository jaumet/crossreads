<p>now the back of my knees are so sunburnt that it is quite painful to move.  Hutchings, Cocking &amp; I joined our company signallers yesterday.  We parade with them in the battalion &amp; no longer with the reinforcements.  We practised signalling whilst the boys had to fill in trenches.  I could have joined the bn. hdqr. sigs. but I heard the coy. sigs. had a better time.  We reinfs. are getting leave &amp; perhaps pay to-day whilst the bn. is going a 17 mile route march.  The natives are quite expert by this time in bringing out a pure Australian oath.  In years to come tourists will wonder how they learnt them &amp; probably some</p>
