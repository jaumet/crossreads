  
 Wednesday 31 August [July] 1917 [1918] Last day of July & nearly 1 year since I decided to leave "Wilga" & how glad I am of that decision, though life is rough just now as regards quarters & messing. Daily breakfast - Porridge, tea, bread - butter hopeless - everlasting marmalade & ditto eggs - mostly bad - cut tops of 2 both "runny". At supper 11.40 p.m., tried 3 more B.W.I's all to judge by black color inside. Walsh is quiet, "Babe" otherwise.  Lt. Youll is a fine Irish boy, O'Leary, V.C., drinker & has very bad malaria at times.  Lt. Mathison brave as possible (fractured femur). Capt. Davies, R.A.M.C., pear thorn in arm, off duty for months.  Pain acute at times, Bettadonna [belladonna ?] & chlor. lin. eases generally, if not N.I. morph. gr. 1/4 or Dovers pdr. grs. x.
