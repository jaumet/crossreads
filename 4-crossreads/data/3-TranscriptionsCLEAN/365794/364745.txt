  
 Friday 7 December 1917 Busy day, 2 officers from Aerdrome adm. 8 p.m., accident.  Faces very much injured, one West, injuries to ankle & more.  Other, ... blood pouring from eye (R), nose & several cuts on face.  Removed to Nazereah (?) 4 p.m.  Pt. Gardner foot amputated, condition good.  Went to A. H.qrs 6.10 p.m.  Recd. 4-0-0 pay to date, shopped & ret'd to 27 in garry after tram broke down.  Went in with S. Murphy & found her pleasant.  Now I am living again as of old.  Life is a very good thing when one is fully employed in congenial work and when off duty time comes I know the women with whom I am living & when in their company can laugh & be gay as the old R.P.A.H. days.
