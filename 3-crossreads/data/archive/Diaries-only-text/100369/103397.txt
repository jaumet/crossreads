Said a lad to me "When I came away to the War, my Mother gave me this" showing me an old, warn, Bible. "And, he continued, with a light laugh, "She believes that I still read it, and that I still pray" He was then "going the pace"

Your last fond gift to me
Ah, then you little knew
(As in your hand you held
The volume old, and gave it to me 
then, with many prayers That I?d be true)
Nor dreamed, such faith was thine
That scarcely would the leaves
Be turned, by hand of mine.

Neglected was your gift,
For long, aside it lay
While, you, dear heart believed
The inspired page, to be to me
A source of joy and strength
A lambent Ray
Of light from God's own Throne
And so you prayed, and thought my prayers
Were mingling with your own.

And so with measured pace
The days rolled swiftly by
And each with tales of broken vows
To tell, and deeper peering in
To sins dark ways
Till God, on High
Seemed very far away
And judgment stirred no fears
And love was stark and gray.
