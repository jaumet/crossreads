of the victims the other day in the Hospital train at Boulogne, it hasn't killed no one so far, but it raises most awful blisters on all exposed parts of the body & especially parts of the body that are apt to chafe, it eats through the rubber in our helmets in a few minutes & so far we have no protection against it, but they wont be long in discovering some check the men who get gassed, appear to be very bad & they look it, but though it has killed no one so far, we don't know what the after effects are going to be, the old Hun's wont half pay dear for this later on, they are only making a rod for their own backs. I noticed that the majority of the patients were artillery men.
