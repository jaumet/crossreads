<p>Friday 2nd November 1917</p>
<p>Breakfast in bed!! &amp; wrote letters &ndash; lunched in Regent Street &amp; got Circular Notes for journey. Visited No. 6 Aust. Auxiliary Hospital &amp; Mrs. Crawford a sister of Katies &ndash; then Sports Club to write letters.</p>
<p>Rang up MARDI who could not come to tea today, but hope to see her tomorrow.</p>
<p>My Bronchial trouble still worries me but Egypt will do it good &ndash; all fog &amp; mist &amp; rain here.</p>
<p>Saw Mardi in evening, as pretty as ever.</p>
