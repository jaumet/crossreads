splendid chaps amongst them & we had been together for so long.   Every night a few of us used to get together & yarn & argue & talk over old times & present day topics with the war always of course the main one. I shall never forget a few of them no matter what happens or how long I live. McGrath, Turner, Land's Jock Mackie, Hayes, Howard, Holmes, Ferguson & a few more were right good fellows & white to the backbone.
We had a dixie of tea & some bread issued this afternoon from Div. Hqr's, & 4 of us also paid a visit to the Field Cashier, & drew some money I got 80 Francs
