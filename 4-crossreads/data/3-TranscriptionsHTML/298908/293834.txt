<p>disappointed it was a very poor thing &amp; the acting very bad &amp; oh so tame, &amp; heavens how it rained it simply poured, came down in torrents &amp; the streets ran like a river.  I never expected Ethel to turn up but she was there at a quarter to 7, she came down in the tram &amp; hopped out at the Post Office where I met <strike>here</strike> her, we then caught the Plymouth tram which took us right to the theatre &amp; even though it rained cats &amp; dogs we never got wet, by the time the performance was over luckily the rain had stopped &amp; the stars were shining so we both got home dry.<br/>Am Orderly Sgt. this morning, very funny when the officer came round this morning he poked his head inside the door &amp; asked for the Orderly Sgt.  I thought he was another Sgt. so I sang out "right here old son will be out in a minute don't get your hair in a knot", so I took my time &amp; put my tunic &amp; watch on &amp; then strolled</p>
