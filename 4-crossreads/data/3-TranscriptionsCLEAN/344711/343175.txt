From the walls of the Citadel, which is situated on a very high hill, there is a fine panorama view of Cairo, old Cairo, the Dead City, the Nile, the Pyramids, & for miles around.  There are here workshops of the Egyptian Government, and a number of wounded Indian troops are quartered in the yard.  It was with regret I turned away from the magnificent scene.
