  
 May 28 at the front are faring. Missed Church, but finished "Ravenshoe" one of Kingsleys. Auntie, Uncle, Phyl & Mary came along this afternoon & we "sprawled" on the grass for an hour or two - watching the trains & buses whiz by & yarning a treat. Talk about perfect weather - its  great ! Am leaving for Harefield tomorrow. Didnt know until 5 pm today, so have written Auntie Em. Nearly forgot to mention the fruit flowers, eggs & cigs which they brought me. Met several chaps in the adjacent Wards who were with me in E Ward over at Boulogne, & one of em the Canadian, straightaway apptd me as Sec'y, & gave me 2 letters to write, & then shortly after, one of our own chaps got me on the same gag. They reckon that they cant see to write. We soon polished off the fruit, & one of the boys fastened onto the cigs. [in margin]  Sunday
