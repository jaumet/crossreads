<p><u>Saturday 28th August 1915.</u>  The meeting of currents and trade winds appears to be fraught with animosity in these regions for the sea is stirred up to a state of wildness, and is making the ship prove her sea worthiness.  This she is doing in first rate style riding the waves in a very satisfactory fashion.  The sun has been visible for only a few minutes all day, with the result that the sea is dark and morose looking.  Usual training after 8pm, 3 cups of cocoa &amp; bed.  Thanks to not hitting the ball square every time my knuckles have become sore, and look like giving me trouble.</p>
