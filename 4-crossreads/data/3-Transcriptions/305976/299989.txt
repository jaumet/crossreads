<p>El Enab. It was raining heavily &amp; bitterly cold all day. By midday our few tents were full of wounded &amp; the rain pouring through. We found three large Caves &amp; had to use these accommodating about 200. All Waggons, Camels &amp; horses which came our way were commandeered to carry wounded to Jericho some 15 miles. A party of slightly wounded set out on foot. We have no rations &amp; things are in a deplorable condition.<br/>Saturday Still raining &amp; cold. Busy bringing in attending wounded. None of us have had any sleep since leaving Shunet Nimron Messenger</p>
