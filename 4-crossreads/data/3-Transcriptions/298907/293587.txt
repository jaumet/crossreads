<p>Well to start with I shall have to go back some 13 or 14 days if I remember right just before we left St. Pol on our way to Flanders again, so I shall have to be very brief &amp; remember what I can, first of all I must mention this is "Anzac Day" &amp; I am trying to scribble away sitting up in my bed in the Queens Hospital, Birmingham, I will have more to say of this later on when I catch my arrears up, so here goes for the back stuff, I think I mentioned in my last diary that we were held up for some unaccountable reason or other in St Pol &amp; while here we were heavily bombed by Gothas,</p>
