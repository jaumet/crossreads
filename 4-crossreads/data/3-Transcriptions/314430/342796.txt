<p>Before the train started we were pestered by <strike>withered</strike> old mesdames to buy oranges, cigarettes, and matches at ruinous prices.

Half an hour later, I could just discern through the gathering gloom, that we were steaming along <strike>the</strike> a low-lying sandy coast.</p>
<p>May 7th:- At 1 A.M. the train pulled up. Troops ordered out. Men wander about a maize of railway lines, some looking for their gear, others struggling to get it on, and many whistling or shouting in order to locate their mates. Eventually, all are ready. "Quick March!" is the order, and away we move in the darkness, through acres of huts and tents. Then comes the word "halt", and we learn we are in the New Zealand Base at Etaples. It is said the reason why we are going through the NZ Base, is because the Australian Base at Le Havre, is quarantined. Blankets are issued. Next we are allotted to bell tents in groups of ten.
