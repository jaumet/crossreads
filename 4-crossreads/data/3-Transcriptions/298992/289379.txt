I have not had a chance to see Noel yet, I daresay he is far too busy getting things straightened out for a few days, to look me up. The sea-air seems to like me, because my cold has gone, and I am feeling in the pink, so don't worry about that, and I am going to look after myself more carefully this time too &ndash; I want to get there sure this time. This is a lovely large boat though not as roomy as the old "Bee", and the troop decks are very warm and close. I have met several fellows on board I know, old Fort St. lads in the A.M.C. and there are some decent lads in our mess, so I can see us having a real pleasant trip over. This may go ashore at Melbourne, though we do not know if we are calling yet.</p>
