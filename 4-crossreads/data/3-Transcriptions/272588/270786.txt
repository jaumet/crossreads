<p>Wednesday 16 October<br/>Another fine day &amp; drive to Ambleside on Windermere via Thirlmere, Grasmere &amp; Rydal waters. Grasmere is very pretty indeed &amp; one gets a view of Wordsworth's Cottage &amp; Seat. Thirlmere is now the source of water supply for Manchester, but the Lake is not all spoilt. The drive is very fine past Helvellyn, but not as much <strike>so</strike> as yesterdays'.</p>
