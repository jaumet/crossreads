<p>There were some big strings of camels coming through here at times one mob I saw must have been 500 strong  Aeroplanes done nearly all the scouting here you could see them flying everywhere.<br/>I caught a snifter cold here &amp; all my lips broke out, they were terribly painful &amp; the dust used to aggravate them &amp; make them much worse.<br/>I went to the Dr with my cold &amp; he gave me a dose of thick castor oil it nearly made sick to look at it. &amp; I had to close my eyes &amp; gulp the horrible slimy stuff down somehow, I would nearly as soon take <strike>posion</strike> poison as that horrible stuff again</p>
