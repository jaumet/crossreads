<p>Well, the day was not over by a long chalk &ndash; The Matrunga &amp; the Eastern came in &amp; were vociferously cheered by the men &ndash; We had guests to dinner &amp; as per usual a lot of drinking &ndash; The month had started &amp; everyone made a new start &ndash; Talking made us drink &amp; the drink made us talk &ndash; I dont think for years I've laughed so immoderately as I did last evening &ndash; A discussion on religion arose &ndash; The navigator got talking &amp; told us that Mary Magdalene was conceived by the Holy Ghost &ndash; He got quite amazed at the laughter &amp; sent for his Bible - <u>to prove it</u> - That display marked out the discussion in toto &ndash; It's a fair specimen of naval knowledge outside a man's own job &ndash;<br/>About 11 pm we got to bed &amp; one man got a light to see that all the girls were in bed &amp; went from room to room with his light &ndash; some times he fell down &ndash; Right &ndash; darling &ndash; you're in bed &amp; so on &amp; on &ndash; One chap had a photo on his wall &ndash; I fancy it was his wife &amp; he wanted it admired &amp; pointed it out &ndash; The man with the lamp looked at it &amp; said loudly 'Well that's the blanky limit in women' &ndash; I laughed till I nearly dropped &ndash; You must never ask a chap to admire anything or anyone or you'll get an awful shock like our chap did &ndash;</p>
