<p>Saturday 2 November<br/>News of the armistice between Austria &amp; Italy. We are to move shortly &amp; go up to the line, which news is a shock to me.</p>
<p>Sunday 3 November<br/>Still at Pont Remy, but I think we move up to the line on Wednesday. Rumours of an armistice with Germany are current.</p>
