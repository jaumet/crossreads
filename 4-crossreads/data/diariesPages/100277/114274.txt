this evening as soon as it gets dark enough having completed our 10 days in the trenches I am writing this sitting in my dugout having just come off duty I have a few minutes to myself before tea. Len Dave Murray are playing draughts on a cloth handkerchief sent me by Mrs Mitchell, it was a very handy little thing not a few get a bit of amusement out of it, while away some slow hours I don't get much time for it myself though I can't say that I am fond of the game Bridge" is the game I like to play, Len I as partners take some beating at it too The guns on the Somme" can be heard very distinctly today, so I expect we are making another big attack down there on that once beautiful but now shell torn ravaged part of lovely France one can never forget it "La Belle France"
