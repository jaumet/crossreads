Boulogne-sur-Mer
A fine day. In the morning took a paper and read on the seafront. Along the quays the characteristic loose redbloused seafarers are a striking feature of the scene. After lunch again went down and this time sat right on the beach close to the waters edge. A few people bathing. W.A.A.C.s walking along the cynosure of all eyes. Rather a fresh sea running. Dined at the club having as table companion a miserable little Yiddisher- Scotch Second Lieutenant. After dinner an English second Lieut M.M. Mons ribbon was drunkenly sick in the smoking room forced everyone to evacuate the place. Feeling very tired went round to the club and there did this writing read the papers etc.
