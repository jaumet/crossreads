  
 by recommending the men for M.Ms, time however will tell.  One of Fritzs Searchlights was very prominent last night, it remained in the same position for hours probably as a guide to his aircraft, who were over bombing. 
 Jeudi 30th Mai A very quiet day & bright sunshine, very little news though of the offensive, the nearest we can get is that he has advanced about 12 miles but it is not authentic.  A game of hockey at night & a sponge down after left me feeling well.  We are about to move but only for a short distance in about 3 days time. 
 Vendredi 31st Mai Fine warm day. Very little doing.  Went over to Querrieu & saw the 13th which Amb we are relieving tomorrow.  I wanted to see the place & see if they were leaving any drugs for me to take over as on that depended whether I would take any from here.  They are leaving a lot so will not have much packing up
