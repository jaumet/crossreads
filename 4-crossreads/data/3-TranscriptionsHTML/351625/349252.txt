<p>Dear Bruce,</p>
<p>I have been intending to write to you for some time in answer to two nice long letters I have received from you lately but I am sure Mother's letters do for you all when I don't get time to write to you seperately.  Ken &amp; I are both keeping well, a bit tired after over a month hard going but we have just had a few days</p>
