well on the way to recovery.  I am in convalescent camp, and expect very soon to be discharged fit.  I will then go to a training depot for some time before rejoining the bty. in France.  Also I will be entitled to 14 days sick leave and for that reason am cabling you to send another 20 to enable me to have a look around.

If I have asked too much I hope you will not send it, but just what you think fit.  Still it is a chance of a lifetime and I want to make the best of it.
Sammy Dickenson & Bluey McNiel are camped not far from here & I will see them within the next few days.
