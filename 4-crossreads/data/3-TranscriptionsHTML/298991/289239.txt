<p>Sunday Nov. 18th Cont -<br/>Queenslanders went off first, then we followed, it was about half past one then. A long string of motor cars were waiting to take us away. I got in a lovely motor car, the Driver informed us we were going to the Cauldfield Hospital. We received a very good reception, cigarettes, fruit &amp; lollies along the road. The day was beautiful &amp; we had a glorious ride to Cauldfield, a distance of about eight miles. Cauldfield Hospital is a fine place. It was good o, having a nice bed to sleep in once again. We were given a bonza dinner upon our arrival here.</p>
<p>Leave was given us from about 3 pm until 10 pm. My pal &amp; myself went out to St Kilda, &amp; had a very decent time in Melbourne. It was hard luck though all the shops, etc, being closed, anyhow we made the best of it. We got back to Hospital about half past ten dead tired. I have a much better opinion of Melbourne this time, than when we called here on our way over. We are expecting to leave for Sydney tomorrow at mid-day. I much prefer the train journey to the boat. They have fine streets in Melbourne. Their trams are very small though.</p>
