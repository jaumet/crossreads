things must be very bad in Germany for them to attempt this mad act. I expect they are driven to it have staked all they have got on this final plunge, no doubt they will make things hum be very nasty for a while but the issue should never be in doubt, everyone over here have the greatest confidence as to the eventual result of the offensive its just the very thing that we have been wanting him to do, let him do the bag hopping by all means when he is sick of it we will take a hand in the fun, he is now having a taste of what we had to put up with all last summer good luck to him his storm troops this should be the beginning of the end France will be a good place to be out of during the next 6 or 8 months for there will be plenty of stouch etc.
