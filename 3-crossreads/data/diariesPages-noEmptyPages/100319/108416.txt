First thing Colonel Durrant AA Q.M.G called with a car and we motored round the whole Brigade area. A fine morning it was very exhilarating speeding along the good roads. Saw Duggan and others in La Chaussee where the good news of Lille's fall took second place to public amusement over a baby born to Madame whose husband was at Salonica. Much speculation as to whether it was English Irish Scotch or Australian. Had a yarn with Matthews at 22nd and old Mackenzie and others at the 23rd. Called in at D.H.Q on our way back to Bde. and saw Col. Miles G.S.O.1 there. After lunch went off on a long walk all over the country in among woods and hills ? a very pleasant day indeed.
