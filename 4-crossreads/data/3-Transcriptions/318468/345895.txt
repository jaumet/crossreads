<p>to Harbor this morning    Have not got any news of what is going on.   Some of No. 3 Sec:  went with "Corda Castle" yesterday morning.   Work going on as usual   Wind rising to-night &ndash; looks like wild weather.</p>
<p>20-3-15.   Wev'e had exceptionally heavy wind since early last night.   About 4 A.M. our tent was blown flat on top of us need less to say causing us not a little discomfort.   Several tents have been blown down in the Camp.  Our Pier is standing well.   The water is breaking right over it at times the wind is still very heavy &amp; cold <strike>working</strike>   The weather is too heavy to allow us to work on the Pier today.</p>
<p>21-3-15.   We had tremendous wind last night but by day light it had eased off considerably.   In the afternoon a cold wind suddenly sprung up from the North &amp; to-night it is blowing very heavily</p>
