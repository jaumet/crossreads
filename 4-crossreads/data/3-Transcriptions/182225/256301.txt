<p>JULY&nbsp;&nbsp; SATURDAY 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>A cool windy day, but a calm sea. We were out of sight of land when day broke. Bill Hunter &amp; Self were mess orderlies and the Battery was on duty. Orders came out that everybody was to continually wear their life belts and water bottles (filled) and on the alarm being given to fall in on our own parade grownds and await orders. We had two alarms during the day &amp; everybody got to their places fairly quickly. There were the boxing heats in the afternoon and we shot off some shooting contests with air guns on the officers deck. The 27<sup>th</sup> Bat A team tied with the Officers team for first place.</p>
