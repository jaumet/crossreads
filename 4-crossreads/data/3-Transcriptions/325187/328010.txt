<p>[Sunday 24 September 1916]</p>
<p>Ferrar met me with a fine "car" at the wharf &amp; took me thro' the emerald lanes 5 miles out to Dun[indecipherable]- a beautiful country home-<br/>Then on to Church at 11.30 AM &amp; in the afternoon all the Neill &amp; Ferrar Clan came to afternoon tea.<br/>They love to hear all about Australia &amp; Mulberrygong to make me very welcome but it is tiring work doing all the talking.<br/>They all have beautiful homes not many miles apart &amp; know not the word poverty.</p>
