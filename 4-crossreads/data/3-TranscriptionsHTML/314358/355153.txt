<p>April 1917<br/>Note for Sheila<br/>The butterfly I sent with Corfe Caslte book for mother was the first I saw this spring.</p>
<p>I was on the ancient Roman wall of earth which surrounds Wareham one day and saw Brimstone settle on the tangle of a hedge at foot of the wall. Down I went and made poor Brimstone a prisoner, but I didn't like the job at all. It seemed rather cruel.</p>
<p>Her whiskers were both fine at first but one is now broken.</p>
<p>There is a splendid book in this institute on Butterflies and the colored plates in it are the best I have seen.</p>
<p>I enclose extract about the Brimstone sent to you.</p>
<p>Keep on with your nature studies you and Ernie</p>
<p>Love to you all</p>
<p>Geoff</p>
