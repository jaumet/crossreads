<p>Weather continues heavy. Was on bridge today (22nd). Spray rose quite 70 feet above f'c'sle, beautiful sight. Running out of north east trades into the prevailing Westerlies. Sunday  <u>Jan 24</u>  in latitude Gibraltar. We are all thinking what a surprise it will be to many folks in E when this ship gets there. Most interesting subject of conversation at present is the matter of leave.<br/>25th.  Weather rough. Interesting incident today. German prisoners on board since Jan 6 &amp; the officers so appreciate kindness &amp; courtesy w. wh. they have been treated from the first that they wanted to make some acknowldgemt. to the ship. That is where I come in, as an unofficial person, &amp;  with an excess of politeness I broke it to them that it is quite out of the question. In these days of evil recriminations, just as well to record the above.<br/>Press news today comes from Malta, telling of sinking of "Blucher" &amp; etc. They were off on another baby killing raid, I expect. Strange! When we were in Pacific a persistent rumour had the Blucher in Indian Ocean.</p>
