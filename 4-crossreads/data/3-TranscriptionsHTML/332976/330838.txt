<p>April 1917<br/>12th   Last night we had a very heavy fall of snow last night which lasted about two hours.<br/><strike>Yesterday &amp;</strike>  To-day we have had large infantry parties working along the road between here &amp; Bapaume.   I went into Bapaume to-night to the picture show with some of the lads &amp; met some old friends in the 1st Field Company.<br/>13th   I had a company of infantry on repairing the road between the Sugar Mill &amp; Le Transloy where it has been badly cut up by shell fire.<br/>The news from Arras front is to the effect that Vimy Ridge is being held, another 100 guns captured, &amp; also that we have got 1500 machine guns 1800 trench mortars &amp; large numbers of prisoners.   Fritz was shelling Bapaume nearly all day but did little damage.</p>
