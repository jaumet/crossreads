<p>France<br/>18/3/17.</p>
<p>Dearest Mother.</p>
<p>Letters received from yourself Tess &amp; Dad and was pleased to hear you were all well. I think you did the best thing when you sold the furniture provided of course you got a decent price for it. Have you decided on a new house, I suppose now house rent is fairly reasonable, if things are not too good let me know &amp; I will increase the allotment, and give you a bit more assistance.</p>
<p>We are seeing quite a large portion of the Western Front and things are considerably better here. there is an improvement all round. Unfortunately I cannot say much about what we are doing and as there is little else to write about this letter will necessarily be brief.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear Frank has enlisted, I would much rather he had remained, but of course he knows what he wishes to do.</p>
<p>I have been to a school of instruction in Stokes Mortars and got a pretty good pass, 'Good Qualified Instructor'</p>
