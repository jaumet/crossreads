<p>I do not think (in fact I&#39;m quite sure) that on any occasion during rifle inspection was I complimented by the officer on having mine cleaner or in better condition than any other, in fact the reverse was invariably the rule.&nbsp; The Officer inspecting would ask the usual question as to when I had last cleaned my rifle.&nbsp; The reply was immaterial.&nbsp; I always had to give it further attention and return to him for a separate and special inspection.&nbsp; It was the bane of my existence.&nbsp; Some fellows spent the greater part of their spare time cleaning, polishing and oiling their &quot;best friend&quot; until they fairly got on my nerves.&nbsp; I was quite content so long as the &quot;bolt&quot; would work and the barrel was sufficiently clear for the bullet to pass through.</p>

<p>The same thing applies to umbrellas.&nbsp; A very poor one you won&#39;t lose.&nbsp; Put a good one down anywhere for two minutes, and you will wish you&#39;d bought a cheaper one.&nbsp; The good one suddenly vanishes, and you see it not again.</p>
<p>So it was with my rifle.&nbsp; I could always depend on finding it in the place I had left it.&nbsp; In fact the very outward appearance was quite sufficient to ensure it&#39;s safety.&nbsp; Anyone approaching my rifle would never pick it up in mistake for his, he would just say &quot;Oh! that must be Gill&#39;s&quot;.&nbsp; When on rare occasions, I was discovered in the act of cleaning it, fellows</p>
