<p>[Tuesday 7 March 1916 ]</p>
<p>I had also sent some money to <strike>Strange</strike>  for Opal but he did not receive it either, I mean at Dungalear.  Some awful fake photos are being published <strike>in Australian papers</strike>  The <strike>Sun</strike> 16/1/16 has one sent by Capt <strike>Reynolds</strike> of A.A. Service Corps shewing 4 wheeled G.S. Wagon &amp; horses &amp; <u>Gippies</u> loading <u>Furniture</u>!!!! &amp; called the evacuation of ANZAC.<br/>It is so absurd, one wonders at a Paper printing such a thing.<br/>Killed a snake near Tent today, after centipede &amp; Scorpions, but no one seems to get bitten</p>
