My dear Father & MotherAs I have been some weeks away from all postal communication I am sending you a cable today to say that I am quite well.Where we have been the last few weeks, things have been pretty hot. Am just down here for a few days spell and am expecting to go back there at any minute.Censorship regulations prevent me from giving any news. Sufficient to say that our boys have made good. To use the expression
