  
 channels - that have no claim, the correct way to my way of thinking in further to Public etc is to have a travelling Rep check all stuff out to proper channels. 
 No sign of land all day. Passed a good few boats. 
 Saturday 4/3/16 
 A very nice day. Sea a bit choppy. Passed the Rock where some big P. & O. Boat was wrecked. The P. & O. Coy are responsible for the upkeep of a light they have placed there at their own cost. It is only attended to now & again, it carries a certain amount of Sulphur & Keop , drip - drip - sufficient to make a flickering light. The Patient Pte Lyman who gave me a lot of trouble last night still bad. Dr Argyle says it is appendicitis and requested the Skipper to put a bit more steam on - so as to get him ashore to operate on him. The difference in speed is very noticeable.
