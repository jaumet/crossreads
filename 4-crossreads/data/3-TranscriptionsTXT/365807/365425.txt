 25.5.17 Mr Justice Ferguson 
 My dear Judge 
 Would you send over the   full   address of your dear wounded Lad &ndash; my better half will send it on to her sister Mrs I.F. Payne now living in London &amp; who no doubt will do whatever she can.  As parcels are being received today for troops abroad there is sure to be a mail early next week &ndash; I shall not be in town tomorrow but if you send the address to my chambers I'll get it in time &ndash; 
 Yours faithfully 
 A.S.Dawson 
 I recd the photos etc &ndash; very good werent they? 
 I had a note from my boy yesterday date 16th Ap &ndash; he was to go out that night with a flying column &amp; expected things would be "pretty thick" &ndash; His first independent command &ndash; in   [indecipherable] F. Am:  with 1st Light Horse Brigade &ndash; He was to cable if he got this all right &ndash; but none has arrived  yet. I fancy things    were   very thick &amp; he has had his hands full &amp; not been back to Cairo as evidently there was a set back at Gaza. He was camped in an orchard (fig trees &amp; nectarines) but no ripe fruit yet &ndash; lovely after the sandy desert -
