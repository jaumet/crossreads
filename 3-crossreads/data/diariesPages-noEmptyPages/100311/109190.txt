25/9/17 Dominion Camp
A clerical day. Recommendations for honours and rewards, promotions of N.C.O.s, court martial summaries and general routine matters. In ally with an attack of nasal catarrh these form a pleasing mixture. The weather was quite lovely but a little on the warm side. The General was around about 4.30 and I went round to BdeHQ at 6 p.m. and had our future objectives pointed out to us. Dinner at 7 ? a very tasteful display of flowers in the table decorations and an excellent dinner washed down with champagne. Colonels Brazenor Duggan James made up the party with the staff and the good wine put a sparkle into eyes conversation. All military talk a mere civilian would feel out of it. Over the table we fight bloody battles over again and change from the red scenes of Pozieires to the mud wet of Flers.
