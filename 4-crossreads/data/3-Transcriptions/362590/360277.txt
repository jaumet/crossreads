<p>In Billets<br/>France<br/>10.1.16<br/>Dear Judge</p>
<p>Have just seen Keith who was driving round in a beautiful car. He took me for a drive &amp; we had a great yarn. He's looking awfully fit.</p>
<p>I know you have heard thousands of fellows talk about Arthur but I thought you might like to know this.</p>
<p>I was on a piquet in a town here &amp; one of the 20th pretty well on his ear strolled up to my post &amp; started yarning</p>
