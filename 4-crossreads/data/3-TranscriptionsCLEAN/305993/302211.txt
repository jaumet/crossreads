But have a few more boilers to use as we are using 5 boilers so far out of 7 since we left London.  But the consumption of coal being high & the distance to Cape Town from St. Vincent being 3981 miles so that coal is of a great consideration as well as water.  The Troops being on a limited amount of water per day enough without waste.  Noon this day, Lat. 13.46 N, Long. 22.56 W, dist. 236 miles. 
 24.7.19 This day commenced with light winds, sea slight & heavy rains, overcast & cloudy.  Very muggy & warm, Temperature 85 Degrees.
