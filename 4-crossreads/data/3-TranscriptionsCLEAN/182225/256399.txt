 OCTOBER   SATURDAY 7   1916 
 Fine except for a couple of very light showers in afternoon. The 7  ​   ​th  Brigade held a Gymkana & it was a great success.I had to go to Durrington  to look for some waggon loads of manure that had gone astray in morning & got back before dinner. I had (Lieut) Col Richards horse & he was not a bad jumper, but I didnt win anything with him. The 27 th   Battery won more events than any other. I was in the wrestling on horseback team & we won. I was on stable picket at night. Saw Billy White, Jo Clonan, Jack Massey & Pop Lloyd there. Got a parcel (a waistcoat) from Linda & a Qdi Gazette from mother
