<p>we skirted this &ndash; and wound our way down to the gully again.  We did not go far though, as we had satisfied ourselves that, the Turks were not mobilising for an attack that night.  We turned sharp to the right, crossing the ridge rather high up  By this time the moon was well up in the sky, fleecy white clouds drifting across her face, but Peace was not over all.  Towards the north flashes would appear, like sheet lightening, then would follow a peal of thunder Boom Boom rumbling over the sea  Our battle ships bombarding the narrows &ndash; We investigated the left hand gully, creeping up the water course looking for Turks, that might have crept down in the darkness &amp; concealed themselves for the purpose of throwing bombs  But Abdul had kept securely in his trenches that night &ndash; &amp; we returned to ours on the tick of 12.  Well that is a night patrol.  There is nothing of the evacuation that I can tell except that I was luck enough to be, one of the 8 picked from our squadron to be the last in the trenches, after the rest had gone.  We had a few hours to ourselves  Yes the hours dragged it was so strangely still</p>
