<p>round the city. It is a picturesque spot. Some of the streets are very pretty, with tall trees &amp; gardens. Oxford is noted for its colleges. Arrived at Fairford about 7 p.m. I noticed a motor, outside the station so asked the owner the way to Mrs Brindle at Haterop. He kindly gave me a lift. The distance was about four miles so of course I enjoyed the spin. The time being twilight &amp; the country was looking beautiful. The owner of the car turned out to be the owner of the public house in Bibury. I forget his name, when he knew who I was, he told me that he knew the pater very well, &amp; remembered him as a boy also. Arrived at Aunt Kate's home at about 7.30. She was most kind to me. The moment I put my foot over the doorstep I felt quite at home. She has three very bright little kiddies, I like them extremely. Dinner was ready waiting for me &amp; it was some dinner too. When they knew that I could only stop a day with them they decided to hire a trap for the following day &amp; take me to Bibury, where you lived as a boy father. The place where the trap was hired from was fully two miles away, &amp; Uncle walked all that way for me. I accompanied him. That is kindness for you. I cannot thank them enough. I was up, rather early next morning, &amp; it was rather pleasant,</p>
