  
 4-8-16 We retired back behind the trenches that were manned by Scottish Infantry & the Turks only made a small half-hearted attack here on the trenches & then retired. One or two of our men were hit with shrapnel before we got our horses out of range & at last pulled up about a mile behind the first line of trenches & waited there till 4 oclock this evening; 
 We then received the order to mount & went west & pulled up for the night in a Hod (or palm grove) close by Mount Meredith which was in the hands of the Turks here we met a big body of infantry (Manchesters)  who had come down from Hill 70;  Our casualties today in H.Q. were Capt Weir (Adj) & Capt Fitzpatrick (QM) both seriously wounded & Lt Nelson wounded  Sig Edwards wounded through left shoulder Sgt Selff [Self] seriously wounded
