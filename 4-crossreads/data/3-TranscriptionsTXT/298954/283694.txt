The B.D. consists of ragging vigorously for 4 bars & then endeavouring to hurl one's partner across the room with one's posterior!

We were all tempted and fell, & amid hilarious shrieks one saw a whirling kaleidoscope of blue & silver French uniforms, green Italian ditto, khaki, navy blue & not a little gold braid thrown in here and there, all demonstrating with verve and abandon "that favourite dance of His Majesty's lower deck."
Fri. 22nd NovA sad day for poor Harry.
Only 350 leave tomorrow, length of captivity replaced rank as regards passports, consequently all captured later than November 1917 are to remain.   "Our Mc", Captns Bruce, Burgess.   - Cave - are to "hier bleiben".
