<p>two Sisters who got the R.R.R. of the old C.C.S.   <u>we were attached</u>.  We (Dot   &amp;  I) got back in time to go on duty at 10 p.m. Had a great dinner   &amp;  it was very jolly, though a   <u>Hen affair</u> .</p>
<p>Shall write a longer letter when I receive any from home. It is a beastly night &ndash; lightening   &amp;  thunder.</p>
<p>Must stop now. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all</p>
<p>XO  From   XX<br/>X Yours lovingly O<br/>Edith<br/>XOXOXOXOX</p>
