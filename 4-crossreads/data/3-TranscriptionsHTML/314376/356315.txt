<p>4.<br/>October 1st 1915. I went into camp the following week at Holsworthy.</p>
<p>I remember well the time I had to appear at the Paddington Police Court to answer a charge of riding a bicycle without a light and was fined 15/- by the P.M. On leaving that I had to go into camp that day he promptly reduced the fine to 12/6 on learning that I was going into camp.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Barracks we were served with refreshments. Meat pie and tea and then set out on our long journey the A.I.F. Took the train to Liverpool and marched from there to Holsworthy. The fare was extortionate to get home 4/-. Coach fare 1/3 train to Sydney and 4d. in the tram &ndash; 5/7 in all a practice used to be to avoid payment. In the trains this was continued</p>
