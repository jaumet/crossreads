<p>My dear father</p>
<p>I posted you yesterday an envelope with 7 photos and a paper cutting in it also a Kai ora Coo-ee. The photos are some I got from a Sergt here and the cutting is an account of the Main Patrol which Cpl Edwards wrote to his brother in Sydney. It is a good account but Edie so far has not seen it and I did not see the good of showing it to him because I know he&#39;d be<s>c</s> terribly wild with his brother for publishing it. In the Kai Ora Cooee you will see &quot;Mussalabeh&quot; mentioned a couple of times - that is the palce I was on for about three weeks when we left our horses behind and were doing infantry work last time we were in the valley. I have tried my hand at journalism this month too, and have written two alleged poems of the &quot;verse or worse description also an article on whirlwinds and I&#39;m going to post them down to the Kai ora. I don expect them to be published but I ought to get a chip in the answer to correspondents column. So look out for next months Cooee. I have kept a copy of what I am sending and will send it home a bit later or perhaps I&#39;ll wait till I see what they say about ir first. There has been no more mail in here yet since</p>
