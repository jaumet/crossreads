<p>going in you don't take much notice but after doing your turn you feel it would be hard luck to get knocked just as you were to have a spell away for awhile. I am writing to a Mrs Edwards tonight. She is a sister of the Mr Harrison I told you of It was Mr Harrison's place I spent my convalescences. He is finding the money for the Soldiers wives that are going to Germany to see their husbands. One of Mr Harrison's Daughters is a prisoner in Germany also he is a major I believe. I was a great favourite with them all while there have had a few letters from them since leaving they asked me to be sure to let them know just where I am as they are going to send me some parcels. Also said if they could do anything for me at any time to be sure &amp;let them know so I shall write them about Bert ; perhaps they can do something for him. I am sure they will do what they can. I shall be abel to get what information you want from them also I have a standing invitation to go back there when ever I get a chance. Harrison is a multi millionaire. Then at Cambridge I met a German he was across here when war brok out so was interned. The Titteringtons that was where I spent part of my leave, have him boarding with them so shall write Mrs Titterington she will see what can be done I am sure.  I put myself out to be very nice to this fellow you know with an eye to business. Thought some day I may be interned in Fritz's land &amp; this fellow's people are pretty well up over there.</p>
