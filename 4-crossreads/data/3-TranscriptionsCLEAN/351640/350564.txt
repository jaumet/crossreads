 My dear Girls:/ 
 Today the post received a letter from me in reply to yours written at Xmas time & the end of December, with hope that they may reach you safely and in due course.  Others went to Mollie, Mr. Macdonald, Dr. Paton, and Dr. Peck. 
 The whole of today has been occupied with operations and ward work, but half an hour was devoted to walking to the top of the sand hill and back.

One might not expect so much to happen mongst the men of a standing camp.

Let me hope that it will amuse you.  "La Navette".  My right arm is somewhat weary so good night to each of you.
