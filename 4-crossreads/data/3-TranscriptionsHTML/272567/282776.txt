<p>18/11/18 Yzeux<br/>autumnal beauties. Had lunch and then walked down to Bourdon where the 6th Field Ambulance are. Saw Muirhead who wrote a prescription for me and had a yarn with Colonel Savage and the other doctors there. Everyone is now discussing <strike>early</strike>the events of the future. Returned to Yzeux and had afternoon tea. General Robertson had called while I was out to say that we are ordered  to be ready to move <strike>at</strike> in 36 hours time. I hope James will be back from leave within that time and that my Riviera leave comes through. Otherwise I may have a trip to Le Cateau and then have to come right back to Amiens again. Almost quite dark now at 4.30 pm and the fireside is the most attractive place in the house.</p>
