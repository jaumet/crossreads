<p>30/4/17<br/>Favreuil<br/>"Get out of bed" was sounded at 12.30am. <br/> A mild morning with a pale moon. After a drink of tea and a bite to eat all the companies cleared camp and silently marched across country to their place of assembly. Rode with Stewart and passed the 23rd moving along in column of route &amp; our own people as well. The movement was carried out very silently and one could have been only a few yards away and yet remained in complete ignorance of such large bodies of troops being in motion. Found the jumping off tape but to find the rallying place was far more difficult as everything alters so much at night. In our training we need a good deal of practice in the dark. Eventually the companies commenced filing up to their hopping off spot but the 21st became hopelessly mixed up with them owing to Brown getting his markers in the wrong place. This was all rectified just as time enough to give everyone a breath in their correct place before jumping off. Picks &amp; shovels were carried by certain men stuck</p>
