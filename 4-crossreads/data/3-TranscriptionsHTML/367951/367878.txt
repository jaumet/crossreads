<p>Dear Beat &amp; Family<br/>Just a line to let you know i am getting on alright my leg is alright again but i have had some teeth drawn and i will have to stay in this camp for a few weeks longer till i get some false ones in i got all of my back ones out as they gave me a terrible lot of trouble in the trenches. All of the Greta boys left the other night for the trenches so i was glad i seen them to wish them good luck. and for them to see i was still alive they all went but my old pal G. Matich so we are still together. Beat their is no news i can tell you as i am never out of camp so you just keep giging along till i come home and always keep yourself and children in plenty of good clothes and substantial food and give them anything they want for Christmas. From your ever loving<br/>Husband Tom<br/>Give my best love to Billys family</p>
