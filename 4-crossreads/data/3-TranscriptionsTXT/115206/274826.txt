 September 1918. Friday 13 
 In Reserve. Hebecourt Weather showery, inoculated against typhoid fever. Worked during afternoon, Cox leave to Blighty. Paid some money  - no good &ndash; no canteens. Played cards and lost a little. Weather wet.  My spectacular sight during evening about 9 pm. When a Fritz bombing plane was brought down in flames by one of our planes, near our camp. Five Fritzs in searchlights.
