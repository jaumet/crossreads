My dear Mother  A big mail has come in bringing 2 letters from Father and four from you, all dated between 4th and 26th Nov. Glad to hear of the great price the wool brought and also that you had had some rain, also The snaps Miss Anderson took of you all were nice, but I think I could beat her in a photographic competition. Was it Fred's camera she was using or her own?  I am still in Cairo on this HQ job. Its not bad work and I think the little bit of office training will be good for me and is certainly better than watering and exercising horses out at Rafa. 
So far the living has been rather hard, they had not room for us at the HQrts mess so we had to go out to the kit stores at Ghezireh and lived with some Tommies there and their tucker was very bad - but we are moving in to the soldiers club in a couple of days and that is a jolly fine place to stop at. We are working at duplicating all the records; I dont know how long the job is going to take, but I think we will all get home in our turn just the same. This rather a hard letter to write this time, Mother.  You see censorship is cut out and we can say what we like, so of course a person does not want to say any thing at all. However censorship has never worried me very much over here!
