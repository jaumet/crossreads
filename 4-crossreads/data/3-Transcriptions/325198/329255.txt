<p>26 February, 1916<br/>Serapeum<br/>We had to fool about the horse lines again &amp; had to shift the tents 1 foot one way &amp; two feet the other way.  I tried very hard to get leave to go up to see Bert but after seeing Capt Anderson, the Adjutant, &amp; Capt White about three times each, I was told that no leave was to be given. Our troop was on [indecipherable] picquet but they did not have a bad go.</p>
