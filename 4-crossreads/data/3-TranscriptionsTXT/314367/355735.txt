we were really at the foot & had only a mile or so to go thro cane grass - up hill - Gordon & Baker as I expected were A1 but poor old N. had all but had enough - However I let G & B go ahead & N & I took it slowly - By 9.15 am N & I joined hands with G & B on the top of Die Mutter.  No one had had breakfast - I carried some sandwiches & a bottle of beer & two onions -  While we were there 4 boys of the Naval Brigade came up - They took their shirts off & wrung them out - We then lit a fire took 2 photos - had the most glorious panoramic view & started back - G & B went ahead but N had to go slow so we hung together - By 12.30 N & I got back to the Hosp & the resident Surgeon (Fitzherbert) gave us a bottle of Sparkling Moselle when he heard of our trip - A quart to the two of us - It was good - We came to the last mile - to the pier - oh - splendidly -
