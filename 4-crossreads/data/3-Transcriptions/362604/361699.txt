<p>out on the Oval for a blow &amp; by the time it was fit to come in it was 9.30 p.m. &amp; I had to have a shower &amp; go to bed then.  By the way the shower is only to be found in Camps.  Even in the best Hotels in London it is always the plunge bath.  Day &amp; night, going to bed, on rising there is scarcely even a minute when there is no aeroplane to be heard.  Last night one kept flying over our Cricket ground &amp; put the wind up us a few times.  He would soar down from about 400 ft. to within 20 ft. of the ground &amp; then fly up again like a swallow.  Well, Dad Dear, I must write to Mum also so I'll ask you to remember me kindly to Old Friends.</p>
