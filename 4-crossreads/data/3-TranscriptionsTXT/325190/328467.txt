Friday 2 Nov 17Still under canvas at Caestre, nothing more to report about our movements.Chance of pay today.Yesterday afternoon Gray & I went for a ramble to Mont de Cats, & reached the foot of the mound on which the convent stands.Met two Tommies who were very pessimistic about our chances of winning.It strikes me that not only are the [indecipherable] here pessimistic but  a great number of soldiers are too.  The advance of the Germans against Russia & Italy seems to be the cause of that.
