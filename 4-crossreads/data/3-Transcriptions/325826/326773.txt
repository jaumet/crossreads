<p>7.  I know.    I am not sure when I get home to you whether I shall talk till you are sick of the sound or whether I shall have forgotten how to talk altogether, if it is sometimes one &amp; sometimes the other you will just have to scold that is all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I told you that I have my own little dining table to myself &amp; I never talk to anyone at meals, but I am not sure that I told you there is no piano here and none of the pleasant social evenings we used to have sometimes at York Pension, though in any case the company here is not so nice, though there are about twice as many as at the York.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I musn't talk any more or I shan't have anything to tell you when I come home except how big the junks of jam on Leo's coat were and the colour of the towel when he had wiped his hands and the bad words Wal used to use to arabs who got in his way or displeased him, and a few things like that.<br/>Give Jobber my love please &amp; tell her I can't try my brain over any more French letters yet, I only know about six words now &amp; have to look up too many in the dictionary, but I will bring her home a couple of the daily French papers that will be better for her instruction than my attempts at letters.<br/><u>Later.  Still April 18th.</u>  I have just had a note from Wallie &amp; must tell you all about it in case his to you are being delayed.  Better still I will copy it on the other side of this so that you will know all I know in case your letters from him are blocked or delayed.  It is headed "Off Marseilles" &amp; dated 3rd April.  The stamp on the envelope is that of London so I think they must have gone all the way there by boat but am not certain.</p>
