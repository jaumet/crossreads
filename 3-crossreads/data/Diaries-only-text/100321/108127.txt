6/1/19 Gourdinne
Dull and threatening day with a cold and piercing wind. Practically all the available men were engaged on the erection of a hangar and its preparation for a cinema show tonight. With K Sutherland I picked the 73 men who are to go back to Australia on the draft of veterans. Our Headquarters and Transport accounts for a good lot. The afternoon was still threatening when I walked over to Nalinnes going through the tangled undergrowth of a bare bleak wood. Saw Colonel James and had a talk to him and then went down to Bde.HQ where I inspected our Guard. With James walked out to a Soccer Match ourselves V 24th and saw a good game drawn. Going home with Matthews and Davis twilight came down on a scene dreary and wintry in the extreme.
