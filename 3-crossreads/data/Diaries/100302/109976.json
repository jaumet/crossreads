Immediately the report of the gun was heard 230 heads would disappear from view as all crouched down.

We had a patrol out at this time and by our cessation of snipping they evidently smelt a rat and put up their flares often. Excellent flares too and fired with some force ? one very bright one travelled  at least 350 yards and landed well in rear of firing line.
