<p>15 March 1918 Friday<br/>Still at the Wadi<br/>Remounts came from Col :<strike> Mc Leans </strike> today mostly Americans, we did hope to be relieved but no word yet, still cold &amp; wet.<br/>On Outpost again tonight- the Wadi opposite is lined with Jacko's but they leave us alone for the present, it is too cold &amp; wet for any fighting &amp; both sides are so tired out.<br/>We <strike>have been [indecipherable]</strike> but still have no Bivies, it may seem strange but 20 miles changes the climate here from the warm Dead Sea to the snow clad mountains.</p>
