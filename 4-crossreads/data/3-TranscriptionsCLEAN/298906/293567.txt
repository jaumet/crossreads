  
 Capt McGregor came back today & we are all pleased to see him in charge again. 30th. My leave came through this morning but I think I'll wait till next week before I go Curran & Carswell are back from theirs this morning I notice. About 20 French Mortars marched into our Coy. last night, transferred to the Infantry, nearly all French Mortar, Engineer, Pioneer's etc. & a good few Artillery reinforcements come gutsers when they get over here for they get shot into the Infantry, there are not a great number of casualties outside the infantry & artillery & what men they do want for these units are generally drawn from the Infantry in France
