 Fricourt 21/12/16 From the other direct came a dribbl straggl of poor exhaust devil from the trench . A sight that made one 's heart bleed . A crucixion of the flesh in real earnest and such as would do some peopl at home the world of good to see . With pinch face , thin stubbl beard and mud cover cloth they lurch along wearili , drag one foot after the other , to their camp . Occasion one fall and sit down in mud or wet . Some feet some of them have ? one chap was limp along with a sandbag wrap round a foot from which he had lost the boot . And so we pass hundr of them all "fed-up " but onli want a littl comfort and hot food to put new life into them . At Mametz we pass a tangl rubbish heap near grown over with grass . It bore the sign board " Mametz Church " rather iron as the ground has been swept by shell fire until it is as bare as a board . Rode through Montauban
