3.Give me the scents of the Bush againIn the good grey land down underThe scent of the red gums after rainWhen the ridges roll with thunderThe reek of the dust when the scrubbers ring.In the trampled yard wings turningThe scent of a sandal bush in SpringAnd the smell of a box log burning!
4.Give me the sun swept plains immenseWhere the countless herrds are feeding.The shimmering line of a five wire fenceTo the rim of the world receedingGive me the long unmeasured trackAnd the far untrodden spaces.The peace & rest of the plains outbackAnd the width of the warm Bush places

[Shorthand transcribed as follows]Says the Sydney "Club" the [indecipherable] this, Will Ogilvie will soon be back from his native Scotland to the land of wide spaces, of fair women and grey horses.  [end of shorthand]1.Give me the sights of the bush to seeThat I only see in dreaming;The silver moon on a gangyall tree,The Sun on a sandhill gleaming;The dip & lurch of a ten ton loadAs it swings through a Western clearing,The dust of a mob on the open road,Through the scattered salt-bush steering.
2.Give me the sounds of the Bush to hearThe bells of the horses jingling;The Magpies carolling sweet & clearAnd the laughing jackass wrangling,The clang of a sliprail dropped in placeThe drum of a bare hoof beating,The clatter of sheep in the drafting rail
