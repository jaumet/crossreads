  
 August 1915 Sunday 1st August Turned out again at 6 am after a good nights rest & at 6.30 went for a swim.  There was a fresh sea on  & it was a treat.  Came back & had breakfast.  After breakfast got cleaned & shaved & attended church parade, at which Sir Ian Hamilton & his staff were present.  He is a slightly built man & looks a fair age.  He inspected us afterwards & seemed much pleased with our appearance.  Said we looked very well after 3 months active service. 
 Monday 2nd August Had an easy day.  Went out on the motor launch in the afternoon & got some luxuries in the shape of chocolate fruit etc.  Was on fatigue at night unloading boxes. 
 Tuesday 3rd Went over & inspected the aviation depot & had the parts of an aeroplane detailed.  The mechanics were very decent.  We borrowed the pontoon
