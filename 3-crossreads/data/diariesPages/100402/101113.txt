Thursday 1 August
To-night we were relieved by a ambulance of 29th Division after this Ambulance doing line work for over 120 successive days which is a record for the Division or any other Division.
Now at La Kreule from where we march to-morrow in the direction of St. Omer.
Very quiet on the front to-day.
Friday 2 August
Move to-day from La Kreule to Racquinham 10 kilos from St. Omer 7 from Aire, just west of the main St. Omer-Aire road. The day is the worst day we have had for months, raining continuously we all got very wet indeed. The march was about 16 kilos but we are now out of the evacuated area in civilization once more.
