Saturday 25th 
Spent a few painful minutes in the dentist's chair. My word, the dentists earn their money alright, every time I have been near their hut they have been up to their necks in work. We paraded in our summer suits and helmets this morning, for the first time and right well they looked. Something is evidently going to happen our tent Division went away last night for "somewhere unknown" To-day we have been busy loading up our gear, and taking down the few remaining tents. Last night, as the tent division took our tents away, we had to sleep in the open. Bill May and I went for a stroll down the lines and came across a circus (this was last night) and as every one seemed to be going in "baksheesh" Willy and I followed suit and got a good 2 hours fun for nothing. The people running the show tried to get the crowd without tickets to go out, but they stood no earthly chance and wisely decided to carry on with the show. This afternoon we were issued with tobacco and cigarettes, also some of us, who were lucky, got shaving and toilet soups. Tonight I am guarding the water cart so I can sleep in the guard tent, and miss the dew. We had Plum pudding for dinner today, they must have had a jolly supply of puddings, as we have had it 3 times during the last week.
Sunday 26th
Last night I was on water picket, so this morning I enjoyed a "sleep in" while the others turned out on Parade.
