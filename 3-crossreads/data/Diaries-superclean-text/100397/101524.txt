now. I have not heard from Harry lately but had a letter from Mrs. Horton a while back telling me that H. might be leaving for this side any day, so I am waiting to hear from him before I write. There is little news that I can tell you here. In some of the gardens a few flowers are beginning to show. Snow drops. Solomons Seal Lillys of the Valley and Primroses, etc. but most of the gardens are like the Houses ruined. just heaps of broken Bricks Timber and roofing slates. The Huns have destroyed all the fruit trees as they have been ready to retreat, but you will see full accounts of their doings in the Papers so I will not try to tell you more here When you see Madeline again will you please thank her for the Little Parcel. I received it safely just before we moved up here. The other Parcels are still missing
Now I must stop with heaps of love to all especially yourself and Bett
from your Loving Son Chas.
Love to all the Relatives when you see them
This Paper I found in a german dugout. as it looked rather good quality I annexed it as I thought I might have an opportunity to write. his envelopes were all spoiled so I could not get one. C
