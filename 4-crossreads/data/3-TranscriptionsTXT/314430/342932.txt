 de la Somme which, in this part, had been completely blocked by  the  sinking across it  of  a large barge. Here I found my Battalion,  at rest  the gallant 20th, whose glorious story had commenced on the ridges of Gallipoli; it was resting on the field of its latest, and one of its  Grea greatest victories &ndash; the capture* of Mount St Quentin. After that famous fight on 31st August and 1st September, only 96 men of the 20th answered the roll, while the 5th Brigade came out but 300 strong. I learned of the death of many of my comrades, some of whom had been my personal friends. 
 September 7th:- We are quartered on the banks of the Somme Canal at a small place called Frise. This canal is full of eels, and dead men too, in some places; and as the eels are easily caught, the cooks are dishing them  it  out for breakfast, dinner, and tea. 
 September 12th:- Have been training vigorously, today and yesterday. This last few nights the skyline has been ablaze,  with  due to fierce barrages on the Hindenburg Line. At night enemy planes bomb s  these parts. 
 September 15th:- Went over the battlefield of Mount St Quentin today. Carefully examined the whole ground, and enemy defences. Nearly had my head knocked off with a piece of Fritzy shrapnel &ndash; it was a close shave. 
 * I was so impressed by the pride the men took  showed  in this victory, that I devoted weeks to work of closely investigating many  of  details  all , and believe my narrative is the most complete and exclusive. It is forwarded, with original notes, with this diary.
