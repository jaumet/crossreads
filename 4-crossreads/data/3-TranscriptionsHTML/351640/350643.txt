<p>Mena House<br/>The Pyramids<br/>Egypt<br/>15 March 1915</p>
<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>Announcement made this morning: "Mail has arrived from Australia in number 132".  Will there be letters for me?</p>
<p>9-30 p.m.  One letter came addressed for me.  The writer was P. J. MacNamara, Coffs harbour, it bore date 8th Feby 1915.  Hope shall I till the morrow, &amp; if not satisfied then shall still hope on.</p>
<p>Yesterday Father McAuliffe &amp; I with some other officers visited the barrage (dam) which is placed across the Damietta &amp; Rosetta streams into which the Nile divides some 12 or 14 miles down from Cairo.  A modern structure which mitigates flood waters, and distributes the precious fluid throughout the delta, from about here to near the Mediterranean littoral.  The two streams break up again as they approach the Southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea forming the delta, which has been famous for its fertility adown all the ages of history.  The mouths are many and reach the salt water between Port Said &amp; Alexandria.  They have not always been the same as today, having varied from causes happening at various periods.</p>
<p>Wednesday the 17th March, two days hence, is set down as the day for luggage to be packed &amp; ready for departure.  I have had no further information about my being left for some time in charge at Mena House.  What ever happens I vow to make the best of it.  It may be all for the good of the great game being played, and that is the primary consideration.</p>
