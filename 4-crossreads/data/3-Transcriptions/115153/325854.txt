<p>One day when we least expected it, a motor lorry came with a relief party, and after depositing the men, took our party to Pioneer Camp, a Camp near Contalmaison Circus, where we joined our Battalion again. From this camp we did fatigues up to the front line at night, and resting during the day. By this time the snow had been falling for almost a month, and the ground was very uncertain to walk upon, especially at night when we were carrying burdens up to the front line.<br/> The Burdens we carried were either rations, planks for revetting trenches, duckboards, sheets of iron or barbed wire or wire netting. Besides losing men in snow covered shell holes, we lost a few through being bombarded at certain crossings, and a few through being sniped.<br/>Sniping was an easy matter for the Germans as our dark forms presented a good target on the white background of snow.</p>
<p>A party of us had the good fortune not to go on fatigue duty one night, and consequently we felt good enough to go for a few miles walk next day, over to Posieres, and La Boiselle. I had not been in the Posieres battle and it was very interesting to be shown over it by men who had been through the fighting. Certain parts of it were strewn with bones and skulls of fallen heroes, so much in number that, had I not seen them, I could not have believed it. The battered trenches and mangled barbed wire, together with mounds of earth heaved up, and the remains of buildings, were evidence of the hard struggle that went on between the Australians and the Germans for weeks.</p>
<p>We then came back across the Bapaume road and visited the crater at La Boiselle. This Crater is a marked feature of the Great War, and was brought into being on July 1st 1916,- after a huge mine had been exploded; the explosion being a signal for the British to attack along the whole Somme front- line. The Crater has huge dimensions of which I should say were approximately 250 feet deep, and 500 feet in diameter, and presents a true basin shape without any irregularities in it. Walking back towards our Camp we came through Sausage Gully, and inspected many groups of graves of dead soldiers, some groups of which, looked very neat in appearance, although some troops, who were in the vicinity had very little time to attend to them.</p>
<p>We did a few more night's fatigue up to the front line from this camp (Pioneer Camp), and then marched back further from the trenches</p>
