 22/11/18 Yxeux-Vignacourt Spent the afternoon by the fireside. The trains being late there was nothing doing at all. At 11.30 pm left with McColl and rode over to Vignacourt. The night was frosty and bright clear moonlight. At the station found the place bright with fires lit by the troops and burning sleepers or anything else to burn. Flaring acetylene lights gave illumination for the entrainment of the horses and vehicles. A busy sight and much awful language. 
 23/11/18. Matthew's train pulled out at about 2 pm and we walked up and down until another came in. Carter had a YMCA cocoa stall. Boarded our train and had a wretched journey all day. Bitterly cold on the feet. Passed through Villers Bretonnieux and then up into new country to us &ndash; all desolated. Detrained at Beutoz not more than 5 miles from Busigny.
