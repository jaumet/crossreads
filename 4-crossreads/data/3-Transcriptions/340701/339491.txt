<p>26-10 [26-6]<br/>Had the last of my teeth stopped today at Bellevue farm.  Seen an old Tramway man there wearing glasses.  One of the sheds of the flare factory blew up yesterday.  It was very funny to see the Darktown Fire Brigade at work.  The Engine run off the line at first.  They got it on again OK.  There was a man chasing it with a Wheelbarrow full of coal for the engine.  The fire looked quite imposing with flares shooting out in all directions.  Gave my Pay Book to the Pay Sgt. yesterday to have my Balance brought up to date.  The Second division had a big picture film stunt lately.  It is said that there were plenty of "fair dinkum" casualties.  The first division is having one soon.  I believe that only 2 of our companies [2nd Pioneers] were in the Bullecourt stunt &amp; only 2 of the 1st Pioneers.</p>
<p>Friday 28-6<br/>Had a big blowout of Cherries &amp; Strawberries toady in Albert.  Had the day off <u>Sub Rosa</u></p>
