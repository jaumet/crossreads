<p>Walker's Ridge</p>
<p>There were at least seven guns on the summit of Walker's Ridge which was approximately 600 feet above sea level.  The guns here dominated all the Turkish positions to the rear of hill 971.,Pope's hill, Courtney's Post  &amp; Quinns Post.  They were responsible for thousands of Turkish casualties which were particularly severe on the nights of May 18 and Aug 6.  The trench running along the ridge was captured from the Turks during the early days of the fighting and was utilized for dugouts and for the storage of the ammunition,.</p>
