 Sunday 18 August 1918 A delightful morning at Tennis.  Was warned in afrn. for passage o/seas on Monday.  Packed &amp; went up for my orders.  This has come as a surprise rather. 
 Monday 19 August 1918 Left Sutton Veny &amp; arrd. S'hampton with Rup for lunch.  Embarked at 7 p.m. and go back to the war once more after 3&frac12; mths. away.  Mehan &amp; young Hughes are on the boat. 
 Tuesday 20 August 1918 Plenty of Yankees on our boat, landed Havre at 8 a.m.  Reported to A.I.B.D. and realised "that it's not to be reasoned down or lost in high ambition". 
 Wednesday 21 August 1918 Up to Gas Chamber in morng.  Was warned later to "proceed" but it was cancelled so Mehan &amp; I went into Havre &amp; had a dip.  Dinner at the Club &amp; home early. 
 Thursday 22 August 1918 Anor. stifling hot day &amp; spent chiefly in pyjamas!!  No word yet to move.  News of an offensive up Arras way.  No mail from Rup yet. 
 Friday 23 August 1918 Much cooler &ndash; thank the Lord!!  Bridge all morng. &amp; won 5 francs.  No mail from England yet.  Also no word to move.  Albert captured. 
 Saturday 24 August 1918 We get orders to leave for the Line so went into Havre &amp; bought a few things I may require.  Big crowd of officers in the A.I.B.D. now.
