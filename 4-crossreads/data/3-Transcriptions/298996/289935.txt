<p>Our Co Sgt Mgr was made Lieut before we left our bivouace which ment a new Co Sg Major will I being senior was entitled to same but that swine had been working against me ever since <strike>we</strike> I was placed in his company.  The whole reason being I have shown him his work or rather he tried to blame me for his mistakes and I gave him his deserts. However this is no place to growl so I shall have to grin &amp; bear it. A junior sgt has been again placed over my head he was wounded in foot afternoon. A  of my fold were called out last night for the trenches facing N.E. we had a quiet night where we were but our boys facing due east were having a busy time. At daybreak we could see <strike>Turks</strike> men running that country Turks did not know them Trenches Disgraceful or our boys soon found out opened fire on them it was lively for two hours. The Navy began to send one string of shell, from village N.E. of Anafath our front it was a Glorified sight my shoulder is that sore from firing the rifle at the unspeakable that I can hardly move it. The Turks have been giving us a lively time this afternoon shelling us with shrapnel They are sending them along one after the other. The afore said village is a force also that hay in the farms surrounding same it is quiet like a bush fire. One of my Platoon got his head clean blown off with an <strike>explosive</strike> bullet.
