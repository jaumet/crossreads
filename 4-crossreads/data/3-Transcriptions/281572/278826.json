<p>Australians.<br/>Dedicated to some of the " elite"  of Durban after hearing their opinions of the Australians<br/>"We are not cotton spinners all, but some love England &amp; her honour yet"</p>
<p>We stand on the shore of Durban<br/>And watch the transports go,<br/>To England from Australia,<br/>Hurrying to &amp; fro, <br/>Bearing the men of a nation -<br/>Who are heroes to the core &ndash;<br/>To stand or fall by the Motherland,<br/>And they are sending thousands more.</p>
<p>We've watched the ships returning<br/>With the cripple and the maim,<br/>With limbs that trail and falter &ndash;<br/>Theirs an immortal name!<br/>The deathless name of "Anzac" <br/>That thrills from pole to pole,<br/>The remnants of the heroes<br/>Of the long and glorious Roll.</p>
<p>And now in their tens of hundreds,<br/>Come the men to fill their ranks,<br/>And what can we do to show them<br/>Our love, our pride, our thanks?<br/>We cant do much (I own it),<br/>But give them a passing cheer -<br/>While the real elite beat a shocked retreat -<br/>Why, they saw one drinking beer!</p>
<p>Oh, God, could we show these misers<br/>The path that the Anzacs went!<br/>Could they rest in their beds at night time?<br/>Or live in their damned content?<br/>Could they talk with a sneer of Australians<br/>When one or two got drunk?<br/>I'd rather a drunk Australian<br/>Than a wealthy Durban funk!</p>
<p>He's a better man than you are,<br/>You dear teatotal saint!<br/>You do not drink, you will not fight!<br/>What wonderful restraint!<br/>We stand on the shore of Durban,<br/>For we're not all made like you,<br/>And the glorious name of "Anzac" <br/>Thrills us thro' and thro'!</p>
<p>But all we can do is cheer them,<br/>And throw them a trifle on shore &ndash;<br/>We are not millionaires (like some are),<br/>Or perhaps we would try to do more.</p>
