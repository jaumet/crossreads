  
 when leaving for France.  I believe Bob Clifton is stationed about 12 miles from here so we are going to hire bikes on Saturday & look him up.  You had real hard luck being laid up so long with your leg but I suppose you are getting round on it properly again by now.  My word the firm seems to have been doing well lately according to Uncle Frank's letters to Ken.  I forget whether I mentioned in my last letter about receiving a cake & a few chocolates & toffee in a round tin from Mother last mail & we are looking forward to getting more parcels this mail as Mother mentions having sent more.  Give everyone my love & much for Mother & yourself from 
 Your loving son Douglas
