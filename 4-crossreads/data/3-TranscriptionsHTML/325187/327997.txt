<p>Dolly &amp; her Mother came tonight, they want me to go to St Annes as soon as well &amp; are willing for me to be married soon!!!  I am sorry Laura is not in town told Mrs Cotton what was going to happen.<br/>Medical Board this afternoon recommended me 6 weeks sick furlough, but don't know from what date.<br/>Cold is much better &amp; I had tea in town with Dorothy   All London is streaked at night with search lights above, but the streets are dark.  Expensive place London, everything has increased in price tremendously.</p>
