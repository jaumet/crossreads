<p>Sunday August 5th<br/>Very quiet all day. Bar for four men who marched in this morning, I had nothing to do. We are getting fairly good food here now since the mess huts have started.</p>
<p>Monday August 6th<br/>A very fine day. The weather has seemed to take a change after all the rain we have had. Handed in Pay book this morning, as we are to be paid on Thursday. Went for a walk over to Cholderton this afternoon, very quiet place though. There is only about "two houses and a dog" existing there.</p>
<p>Tuesday August 7th<br/>All men other than "A. class" had to parade before the Adjutant this morning. I was about the only one that hadn't, no body knows the reason, (silent military again). A lovely day today. Received knews that I with three others <strike>are</strike> is marching out to Weymouth tomorrow. Got my classification put in my pay book this afternoon, also received my pay book back from pay clerk as I wont be paid here on Thursday now.</p>
