<p>7/5/17<br/>5.45 am.  General Gellibrand rang up "We have taken Bullecourt &ndash; there is no need for the Anzacs to bomb down!" Despatched a carrying party of 100 to 1st Bde dump to carry up to them. It looks as if the Jocks have again done good work where the English cannot. A lovely sunny morning &ndash; the aeroplanes overhead calling for information by means of a flaxon horn. The 23rd a couple of days ago shot down a Hun bird with their Lewis guns. General Gellibrand came over after breakfast and we yarned nearly all the morning about matters of Battalion and Brigade interest. Latest reports show the Scots not quite through the village so that there will be some dirty work in the counter attacks at dusk if our people don't move up and get their blow in first. Barrages all round Bullecourt but round here all is very quiet and there is nothing doing. Saw what I have often heard of before today in a 4.5 howitzer &ndash; the shells leaving the gun and in flight. These batteries being so close to us every report shakes the whole ramshackle place and brings dirt down</p>
