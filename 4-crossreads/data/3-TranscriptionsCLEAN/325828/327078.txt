 [The bottom right corner of next 3 pages torn off.] My dearest Father, You will be glad to know that your Xmas hamper arrived from Griffiths Bros 2 days ago. My word it was absolutely fine, & I sincerely thank you all at home for your kindness.  It arrived in splendid condition and I can tell you that I appreciated it very much.  It was awfully good of you at home, & please accept my heart felt thanks. Your letters dated 17th of  N  October & thereabouts reached me on 24th November which is absolutely a record for speed.  I am sorry that I can't write separate letters to you all but as I only have one lot of news to write about I think a long general letter just about fills the bill. We had our first fall of snow here on the night of December 1st.  It certainly was not very much, about an inch in the open & of course more where the wind drifted it into hedge & ditch.  My, but it is fine to see the English countryside covered with Natures white mantle.  Well can I compree the expression now, "As pure as the driven snow."  Every day since,  wh  we have had [torn page] of snow, & to-night as I write I glance out the [torn page] & see the Aerodrome one huge mass of glitter[torn page] - glittering under the stars.
