still the same as in 1815, the various farms concerned in the fight still standing.  Bought the usual postcard & whilst having some refreshments the Garcon proudly shewed us a skull & rifle, relics of the battle.  Returned to Brussels for dinner.  Wishing to do Antwerp as well we next enquired about the train & decided to catch to 7A.M. next day.  Spent that night in a cafe typical of the place.  A large, well decorated, carpeted room, small tables etc & a small dancing floor in the centre, with good orchestra.  Drinks only served & are more expensive than outside.  Several exhibition dances were given also the latest one steps bostons etc, splendid, dancing to the latest tunes, English tunes like Tipperary.  A broken doll etc being prominent.  Turned in about 11.30 after having arranged to be called at 6 oclock & for early breakfast.
