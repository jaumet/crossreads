wearing red fezs were working on the roads which were crowded with horsed waggons, lorries, motor ambulances, etc, all painted a dirty, dull grey colour. French transport has a very nondescript appearance; the horse waggons are old hay carts, furniture cans etc. of different types & the mechanical vehicles all seem to be second hand & done up on requisitions. However they get the work done which is the main thing. We had 4 hours in Dunkirk & had a good look round. First went out to Malo-les-Bains in the tram, a well known seaside resort before the war. In the other direction we went to St Pol by tram. Both in the town & out at Malo were evidences of German handiwork. Dunkirk has been both bombed & shelled (from land & sea). Rusty barbwire entanglements run along the beach with trenches behind them. Inside the harbour entrance there is a fine system of waterways & canals full of naval & fishing shipping. We dined in an up to date restaurant - a real good French dinner. The town is fairly quiet & prosperous looking. There were numerous American sailors, Belgian officers & English military & naval men
