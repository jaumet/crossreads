 Saturday 19/2/16 
 Self &amp; 3 Orderlys were rudely awakened in our snug little deck Cabin by W.O. about 9.30 am, to pack up our wardrobe &amp; get out &ndash; as a Case of measles had broke out &amp; they wanted to Isolate him &ndash; we forgot what we said to him &ndash; after having a big night &amp; had just got in dream land, I roared to such an extent about not getting any sleep &amp; always being disturbed, that I was going to refuse to act of an night etc &ndash; At any rate I bluffed the W.O. &amp; he said well keep quiet &amp; follow me &ndash; my home is now in Cabin 95 &ndash; One only wants to travel on a troopship to know what a Chuck in this is &ndash; quite enough I slept soundly the rest of the day. 
 To night Wireless seemed to be calling &amp; talking with Ceylon. I never saw such beautiful sunsets. Full moon tonight is also charming. Feeling a lot better
