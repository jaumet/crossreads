5/5/17  Norreuil
people. During the afternoon the Huns put up heavy barrages on the railway. Orders came down for the C.O. to go back to DHQ details camp for a rest and I to take over command of the battalion ? now only about 200 strong. Of these 100 went away on fatigue about 8.30 pm At 11 pm the Germans attacked and our artillery put up intense barrages on the S.O.S. going up. Our troops stood to arms on the sunken road and extra bombs and SAA were issued at once and the Lewis guns emplaced. About 12 p.m. the fire slacked and we stood down. The rum issue seemed to be rather too much for some of the men ? in their present highly strung and nerve wracked state a little of the strong firewater unbalances them. Considering everything all the men are wonderfully cheery and bright despite our heavy losses. Todays papers speak of victory on just this front! More lies for a credulous public ? why not admit things?
