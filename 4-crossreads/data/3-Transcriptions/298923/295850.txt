<p>3 July 1918 Wednesday<br/>Usual artillery strafe most of the night, &amp; not much sleep, still am fairly fit but "nerves" not as good as they were-  Our second in command gone away to get married- quite a lot of our Officers are becoming sensible in that way-<br/><strike>Dolly writes all well</strike><br/>Malarial here is different to Africa-   A man runs a high Temp: up to 104&deg; then goes normal next day- very little SHAKES.  "Tummy" troubles are frequent, &amp; a soreness in all limbs   I think the <u>weight</u> of air we carry so low down below sea level makes one feel off-</p>
