<p>18.4.15<br/>Sun. 18th.  Came out in orders this morning that Nelson is Sergeant in Head Quarters on probation.  Felt too tired &amp; lazy to go to the Church service this morning, so dozed in the tent till stables sounded.  After dinner I was watching an Egyptian boy drilling, &amp; he knows more about it than does most soldiers.  In fact the Regt. S.M. Lindsell could not think of an order that he could catch him on;  he collected 37 piastres on his work;  he was taught by the lads at Mena.  Stan had an afternoon pass, &amp; went to Cairo.</p>
