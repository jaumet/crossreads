<p>presents from here, this year. Belle will do as I arranged before. If this gets in time, dont send me any b &ndash; because I have plenty. Should like warm stockings, singlets &amp; gloves (grey).<br/>We did have a little excitement in Ismailia when the bombs were dropped but they did not do any damage &amp; were not at all afraid, they soon turned tail &amp; flew when the airguns began. Wish I could tell you of some of the events but must wait until later also you hear more than we do, in your News Papers. Dont say too much about my affairs because things are very uncertain.<br/>I'm very well &amp; as happy as can be, so dont worry about me.  I had a nice letter from Maude &amp; Len. they are always thinking of me, hoping I'll call there on my way home.</p>
