  
 22-5-16 wide & just steep enough down the sides to hold the sand together without a slip;  It is easily the highest point for miles around here & we have a great range for helio work & can get into communication with any troops within 20 odd miles of us;  About 4 miles to the north of us is the Meditteranean;  6 miles to the east of us is Qatia where the Tommies were cut up; 
 Today the 6th Regt went to Qatia & is camping there till the moon rises   they got into camp early & we were in communication before we came in at six oclock;  A cool breeze was blowing off the sea all day & the sand was blowing over everything making us very uncomfortable   there were four Helio Stations on the Pinnacle;  I was feeling tired
