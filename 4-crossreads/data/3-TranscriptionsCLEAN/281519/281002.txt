Firing Line (N.34 b 9.9 - N.28 b.3.3)26/12/16 Long steep stairs have to be gone up to reach the outer regions and having occasion to go up I turned turtle in the mud and sprawled full length. Just about a climax. About 13 wounded men passed through us today. Frenger's head has been tender ever since he got a bullet through it and today on the way up he relapsed into delirium and had to be laid up in a dugout. Rations short in some respects - more worry there. R.S. rang up referring to a message he got this morning. Despite his reprovals some particulars later requested by the B.M. showed representations had borne some fruit. Find the steel helmet saves the head from some nasty knocks when one is groping round stairs and the low passages ways of these rabbit warrens. The head simply bounces off all the beams it comes into contact with and the rubber shock absorbers take all the concussion. The village of Les Boeufs just neighbouring here is the usual well strafed mass of ruins & shattered trees
