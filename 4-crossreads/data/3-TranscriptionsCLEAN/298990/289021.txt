  
 Etaples 
 18/9/16 Day was ushered in with heavy squalls & rain continued until well into the afternoon.  After lunch went down to an Ordnance store and bought a waterproof overcoat.  This store was quite the most businesslike place I have ever seen in connection with Ordnance and it would be a boon if they had similar places close up to the firing line.  Rain cleared up later in the afternoon.  The village of Etaples lies in a hollow and is a grey stone & red roofed old place apparently a fishing place.  Formal mess in the evening. Kings health, band, and so on and feeling in a conversational mood yarned with some new officers who had not seen active service and regaled them with war experiences and tales of old battles fought and lost until after 10 o'clock. 
 19/9/16 Awakened by Adjutant at 7.10 and told to take charge of a parade for the Bull ring at 7.40 which left no time for washing or shaving.  A major handed me over the command of the parade and I took charge of the whole show 1479 men and only had one subaltern.  Marched the whole crowd off about 2 1/2 miles to the Bull Ring where instructors took charge of all the men and gave them excellent training.  With some other officers I went over the mechanism of the Lewis gun and then we did some firing with it until 12.30 when the parade formed up again & and marched home.  Owing to lack of officers the marching and discipline on the mass parade is extremely slack but in the Bull Ring there is no nonsense as there are plenty of old sergeant instructors who run the whole show.  It is a memorable sight to see so many thousands of troops English and Dominion working intensely.  A train load of  Huns went through during the morning.  After lunch it rained and was very cold.  I had a cold bath and clean up shave and spent a slow evening in the mess.  Turned in early and slept until about 3 am when some new arrivals came in and woke me up.
