<p>Calderon's dramas, but early set the book aside.  A dull afternoon after a good sun morning, and great clustering clouds.  So far no parades beyond a roll-call this morning, and a rumoured promise of double innoculations against 'flu' and 'Meningitis' starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Leave Notes.<br/>Yesterday morning to Georges at the top of Park St. in Bristol with a great bag of books for posting.  On Thursday from Southgate with two bundles to Mr. Mayhew for packing and posting.  So the accumulated books of two years handed over for forwarding to Aust.</p>
<p>A good edition of Boccaccio bought in Charing Cross Road, and an American Press edition of Swinburn's first series of "Poems and Ballads".  From another shop, Ezra Pound's 'Lustre', and a well printed book of Ben Jonson, from Mudies, the Cuala Press "Responsibilities", and from Smiths at Bristol, the 2nd number of "Form" &ndash; at 3/-.</p>
