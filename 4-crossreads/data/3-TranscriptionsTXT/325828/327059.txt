 wristlet watch-compass.  Of the ordinary size, for a wristlet watch, the compass is on top of the watch on a hinge, so that lifting the compass up like the cover of a watch, the watch is visible beneath.  Both compass &amp; watch are luminous &amp; as they are also both very accurate it is a very useful &amp; handsome present.  It was indeed very good of the Doctor, &amp; I thoroughly appreciated his kindness. I received a letter from Ol, &amp; one from Walter last week forwarded on from London, for which please give them my thanks.  I was so glad to learn from Oll"s that the bone in Walter's arm is beginning to knit &amp; trust by this time he is well on the road to recovery Walter will be interested to know that I met Lieut Moye (?) of 2nd Btn. in London about a week before I left there.  I made myself known.  Wally had introduced us previously at Sailly-sur.la.Lees I think, &amp; he remembered me.  He asked very kindly after Walter, &amp; said he had written to Wal, &amp; hoped he was getting on O/K.  Although my present address is 2 A/M.
