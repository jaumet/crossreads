<p>This morning we are to have an interview with the Colonel &amp; we will know whats doing but you can bet that we will return to our units.  There are great numbers of hop-grounds round here &amp; some of the crops are very good &amp; there are a few old windmills in action I suppose they use them for grinding corn.</p>
