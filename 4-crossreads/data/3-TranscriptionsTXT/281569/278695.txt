 Nothing much during the day only a few of our planes were over taking photos, we have just got our lines &amp; office straightened out nicely &amp; the nuts have been screwing it off to some tune, Gen Chavel &amp; his staff returned to Hill 40 today, now that the stunt is over the. The 2nd Regt collared El Sagri &amp; found British clothing &amp; ammunition, also Turks ammunition this they burnt &amp; the flames were visible even from here. 
 Feeling a trifle off again tonight, fear fever.

A Turkish patrol was sighted today at Oghratina but they imshied before we got at em.
