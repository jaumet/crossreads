during invasion. Passed through into chamber of Hassans tomb. The lofty roof (sandalwood) most exquisitely carved and decorated. The corners looked like beaten copper work. The tomb solid alabaster surrounded by railings. On stone floor two rings of trapdoor leading to the vault of the Sultan Hassan's family. Looking from window could see the outside stonework of the mosque scarred with Napoleons cannon. In two places the cannon balls are still visible embedded in the hole they have made in the stone. Saw reading desk of wood most exquisitely inlaid with ivory. Space to hold book very large evidently large manuscript Koran. This mosque easily the most impressive seen in Cairo but is apparently not used very much despite its big proportions.
