Our Brigade then leapt the parapet occupied the front lines, digging the prisoners out of their dugouts & passing them back, this procedure was carried back to the 4th line, when the Germans receiving large reinforcements, our men fell back to their own line, a fierce barrage fire covering their retirement . They destroyed the trenches & did great damage & it is regarded as a great & daring episode in the lives of the Anzacs. These raids are causing great havoc in the German ranks & keep their nerves strung very high, it is the kind of thing that is wearing them down. This episode shows that the trenches were ours for the taking of them, yet orders were, that we had to fall back to our original line, once again proving that the longer the German line is, the more he is becoming exhausted.

The wind has now dropped but the sky is still overcast & rain is threatening. I shaved my upper lip today as orders came out that it is now optional whether you grow moustache or not.

We all went down to be "gassed" today to try our new Box Respirator helmet. After careful instructions as to how to use them, we were all carefully fitted & marched into a chamber, & closed in. Lackurmatory
