 5-8-16 Sat 5th Last night we gave the bridle reins a twist around one foot & lay down anywhere & dropped off to sleep & our horses were about as tired as we were & did not disturb us; at 2 oclock this morning we were mounted again after getting out water bottles filled from fantasies brought up by the Indian Camel Transports, & also got two more horse feeds to take with us, we went due south for 3 miles & saw the results of our artillery fire;  Camels were lying dead everywhere some loaded with artillery shells & others with machine guns
