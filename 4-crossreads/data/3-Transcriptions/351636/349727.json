<p>Dear Mr. Horsfield,<br/>Could you help Mrs. Chippendall who is in difficulties owing to debts &amp; whose husband has not left her an allotment. This is being enquired into but is evidently a complicated case &amp; there has been much delay over it. We are enquiring with it now.</p>
<p>If you could give a little temporary relief I should be glad as she seems in need of clothing.</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>B. Booth &ndash;</p>
