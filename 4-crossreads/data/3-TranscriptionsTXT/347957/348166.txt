we would have had another try before getting back in our camp.  We had no opportunity, as our train was not long in coming in, and we which set off for our camp and trial.  This train only took us about 40 miles when we had to leave it, and wait for another travelling North.  We had to wait 7 hours in the Refreshment room, but felt altogether too tired and exhausted to make any further attempt at escaping, so dozed off and slept until our train pulled in, and took [indecipherable] us[indecipherable] to [indecipherable] camp in which we were then attached at Burgsteinfurt.  Here we were again searched, and such things as belts, braces and handkerchiefs were taken from us, in case we might lassoo the Commandant or something equally as bad.  This particular Camp was just being closed, so that our stay here was for only two days.  It was at this camp where they had "Frauleins" helping to censor parcels, and such things as sweets, nuts or tooth paste or powder, were invariably lost to us.
On being mustered for our separate camps I met a Russian officer who had been out working the day before, and had filled his pockets with fruit [indecipherable] when seeing me came up,  shook hands, and shared out his fruit, which was not only satisfying but very palatable.  The soup issued here was boiled greens, of what kind I know not, but it certainly was not appetising. Amongst us was a Tommy who was unfortunate enough to have been kept working behind the German firing lines for seven months, and was nothing but skin and bone.  What little skin covered his bones was a mass of sores and scabs.  Of course, while there he had received no parcels, and the amazing thing is that he lived at all, but he was merry and bright, for he had just received two parcels and some letters from his dear ones at home.  He bid us good-bye as we parted, with a cheer and a wish that we might meet in England.  I could only wish with all my heart we had met there, for it is by such men as he that we have built up our Empire to what it is to-day, men that never say "Die".  Unfortunately his name and address were lost in one of my many searches in camps.  He was then undergoing treatment, and when we left he went to another Hospital while we three escapees and the Russians went to 'Clink" [indecipherable] where I had a long and interesting talk with the Russians,  of the advance through East Prussia, in which they had taken an active part.  They firmly believed Russia would come to her own again, and as soon as order was restored would carry on against Fritz, but whether this contention will come true it is hard to prophesy. By the way these men had escaped from Austria towards the Swiss Frontier, but found it too mountainous, and had to turn off to Holland.  Their journey occupied 62 days, so that they had a good idea of conditions in both countries and I made the most of my time there to ask them many questions. Of the conditions in Austria, they said that the economic position was far worse than in Germany, where we all knew it was bad enough, and where while owing to their complete organisation, all classes got their allotted amount, it was not so with their Austrian Ally.
They had occasion to cross the Kiel Canal, by going over the main bridge, from where they could see numerous Battleships, and I thought at once, "What a splendid target for our  Airmen, could they get so far."
