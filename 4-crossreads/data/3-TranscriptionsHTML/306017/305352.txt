<p>no big action.  Artillery was fairly busy.  Returned to camp at 10 pm on the 2nd [Aug].  The 1st Brigade put out some squadrons on outpost on the 3rd &amp; they were heavily attacked on the morning of the 4th.  The fighting was heavy.  The 2nd LH being particularly conspicuous in the rearguard fighting.  We only had 3 hrs sleep on the night of the 3rd  &amp; were mounted &amp; away before 4 oclock  At dawn our position to the South &amp; S west was heavily attacked.  German aeroplanes dropped numerous bombs &amp; the camp was shelled.</p>
<p>Fighting was very solid nearly all day.  The Turks pushed us back for nearly a mile but they lost heavily our artillery &amp; machine guns &amp; rifle fire doing a lot of damage.  Our regt was on the extreme right &amp; we had to hold off an enormously superior force.  They got round our flank &amp; we had to withdraw &amp; gallop back.  We got away all our wounded &amp; then went round further on the right</p>
