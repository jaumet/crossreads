<p>Tuesday Feb.18.1919.(100)<br/>continued from<br/>Book 12.</p>
<p>I am going on leave tomorrow. At 2.30 today drew &pound;8 and in addition was paid &pound;2.16.0 ration money for 14 days leave. No free railway passes are issued now, but ration money is paid instead, which for those who have only a short journey to go is much better but in my case it will probably take it all for fares. I paid to the Furlough Sargeant 14/- for fare to Belfast. There I will get a return ticket to Kesh or Pettigo. Also  a single ticket to Glasgow &amp; from there a single ticket to Weymouth, Unless I alter my programme on the way.</p>
<p>The Germans have signed Allies New Armistice Terms. They are to give up all offensive operations against the Poles. The armistice of Nov.11 prolonged by the agreements of Dec.12 and Jan 16 is prolonged indefinately, but the Allied Powers reserve to themselves the right to break of the agreement at three days notice.</p>
<p>The carrying out of the agreements of Nov.11, Dec 12,</p>
