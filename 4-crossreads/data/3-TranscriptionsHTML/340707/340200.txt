<p>It happened like this I was too late to be certain that buses would get as far as Whitehall so I went for Tube. There was a big crush but I got in &amp; in train some gent whose little boy I had saved from being crushed advises me to go to St James Park which is inside the ring which procession makes &amp; hence after this train is out of bounds This reasoning is good &amp; we get an excellent view in Rochester Row.</p>
<p>Her Navy marches first after the visiting contingents of course Haig is very pale &amp; as it turns out afterward is very ill. After all has passed I try to get out but policeman says only way is by 'plane but if I wait an hour at Tube station I may get in.</p>
<p>As I want something to eat having missed my breakfast I decide to wait but imagine my surprise when I walk right in. Everybody has expected the crush &amp; avoided it. I reach town long before procession has reach town &amp; dine in comfort as all the world is still looking at the procession.</p>
<p>At 2 pm there are several concerts in Hyde Park &amp; rustic dancing including a revival of the old English dances</p>
