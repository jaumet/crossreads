Another batch of Prisoners (Russians) came to the fabrik to-day, ten in all.

For the last few days I have been studying a German Grammer book, trying to pick up a little German, But I do not make much progress. I am going to write to England for one or two books on German, and start to study the Language in my spare time.

The weather is getting much warmer now, all the frost has gone and the trees are beginning to grow their leaves again.

On Saturday I wrote to Alma granting her permission to draw my money, which she asked for. On Monday April the 15th news came through that Armentiers had fallen into German hands. The clocks were put back one hour at midnight last night for daylight saving, It is twilight till about 9 o`clock at night. To-day I wrote to England for some books on German Grammer, I intend to study the language while I have the chance.
