 Saturday, November, 1915 Heat terrific, firemen  exhausted keeping up speed one man taken ill consequently lost speed &amp; dropped behind for about a mile it gave us the opp to study the other boats, however we soon made up our ground when the new watch came on.  Orders were issued from the flagship that between the hours of 8 to 8.30 all lights must be extinguished.  It was just for emerging practice &amp; the men fell in in their respective fire stations without a word.  What is generally a myriad of lights was total darkness as all the fleet extinguished her lights.  Danger is ahead somewhere as the officers are taking every precaution.  Expect something important to write shortly. 
 Sunday, November, 1914 Roasting day oppressive &amp; sultry Picquet.  In morning stables crushed my thumb badly whilst removing a horse.  Pain was so much that I fainted whilst it was being dressed.  The Euripides had a burial service of a young private who died.  The service was in view of us it was impressive.  In the afternoon a sports meeting was held on our boat &amp; the men enjoyed themselves immensely.  Although grave danger is lurking ahead it only makes the men more eager for fun.
