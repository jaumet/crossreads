Apr; 4Easter Sunday.  We are kept in camp , as the Cairenes have a Fete Day on; if "the boys" got amongst them there would be trouble.
Apr; 5To-day in camp has been like hell - great gusts of wind which blow the sand into the eyes, the nose, the throat; almost suffocating - sand, sand , sand everywhere. I break camp and visit Garavedien, during which time picket entered the Doctor's surgery and ordered me back to camp. My God! What a manner in which to finish perhaps the last days of my life - I have offered my life for my country but it seems to me they have also taken my liberty - such is the military life.
Apr; 6Soon we shall be upon the battlefield - I pray God that I shall not be wanting when we are under fire.
Apr; 7Drill - visit Cairo
