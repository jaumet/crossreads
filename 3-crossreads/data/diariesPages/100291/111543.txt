1917 Tuesday 27 March
Ward emptied today. 4 Transferred to C. Ward. Leaves me free. 
Take advantage of afternoon off journey out to Millencourt visit Tony. Find the old warrior looking quite fresh much fatter in face Has had some new teeth in. Not having seen each other for nearly 2 months had a great old yarn. He is evidently very popular now in the unit. Has been making great speeches etc in debates the like. Mellincourt a huge Rest Camp. Church turned into a hospital all cot cases. The alter a table for medicine bottles lint. Once it was the spiritual now it is the physical needs of the body that are ministered to within its white walls. 
Went to pictures mesmerism in Albert after on way home. Not much good.
