Saturday Jan 26th 1918 & Sunday 27Left camp about 9 a m fully loaded this time ammunition & dry rations - & marched to the railway at Le Harve between 5 & 6 milea a very bad road & as it was hot it took a lot out of us. The train did not leave untill afternoon We were packed 32 in a cattle truck just enough room to lie down by fitting in close Tea was supplied about 9 & there was plenty of butter buscuits  Jam & cheese in each truck. Put in quite a good night & have traveled slowly with many stops Detrained at Castre & marched about 2 miles to a small camp getting there just at dusk & were alloted to tents & given an extra blanket. The country is very flat & uninteresting as far as I have seen. Saw a few shell holes about Hasellbrock a fair sized place few miles back The only reall signs of war so far
Monday 28thWent for a very short march this morning without packs. Can hear
