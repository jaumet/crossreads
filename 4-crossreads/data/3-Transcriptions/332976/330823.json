<p>March 1917<br/>24th.   To-day I had 6 A.S.C. "G.S" wagons &amp; 8 Artillery "Limbers" to bring up a number of "Armstrong" huts from near Gourdicourt to D.H.Q. between here &amp; Bappaume, where they are to be errected by the Company.<br/>The "Deaucaville" railway has not yet got up as far as this road (Bappaume Perrone Rd) but the Pioneers &amp; pushing it forward for all they are worth &amp; expect to have it here by to-morrow.   The weather has been very cold of late &amp; today the temperature was down to 27.5&deg;.<br/>The daylight saving scheme started again to-night &amp; the clocks have been put on an hour.</p>
