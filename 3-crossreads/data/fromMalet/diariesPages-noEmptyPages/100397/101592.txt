the coast, Just a farming Community, the little village is hidden away down in a valley and would in Summer be a picturescue little place. the Church is in the centre, and each morning about 7 A.M, we hear the bells ringing on Sundays the villagers come from a little village about two Kilometres away, all dressed in their best Sunday Clothes. The farm land lies all round the village, and I believe it nearly all belongs to one man, who lives in a big Chateau just near the village. The principal crops, seem to be wheat, Mangolds, for winter feed for stock, Turnips, and Sugar Beet, The latter crop is just being harvested and sent away to the Refineries .. farmers are also busy plowing and sowing wheat, which the Rooks promptly search for, there are thousands of Rooks here, They are everywhere one looks, across the fields and nature looks after them well, in the part of the world, there are no berries, but there are enough earth worms to feed all the Rooks in France round here, The earth just seems to be Teeming with them.
