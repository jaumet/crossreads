<p>Field &amp; we are hoping to hear great things of them when they get a few tastes of active work.</p>
<p>I am now at the Kitchener War Hospital, taken over by the No 3 A.G.H. [Australian General Hospital] &amp; we get convoys direct from France &ndash; all kind of troops but always a fair sprinkling of Australians. We got 200 Australians on Xmas Eve &amp; I was pleased I had gone to the trouble of ordering a crate of yellow wattle in full bloom from the South of France for they appreciated it so much when they arrived.</p>
<p>They get here looking very tired &amp; worn out. Young lads with faces of old men, but the youngsters lose this look after a short spell; the older men are aged for all time I think. I am surprised at the number of men 45 to 55</p>
