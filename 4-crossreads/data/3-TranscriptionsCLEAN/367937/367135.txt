  
 7 there, they said that I hap dip. and gave me the 6000 units which made me sit up some.  Next day on in the hospital train to Kantara and there two days before they found out that I had not got dip.  The worst of it is that till today since leaving the regt. I have been on milk diet- but by Jove I am making up for it now.  I have written to Miss Macphillamy in case she is still in Port Said and think I will send a note to Mr.Trelawny too
