  
 Dear Judge 
 Please excuse this very hurried but I wrote you about a week ago. Since then I have 2 letters of yours just arrived of 16.XI.15 & 10.1.16. The Post is most irregular - Re your Amelioration Committee, I send list of 4th men. Also rough plans of Anzac. All maps were destroyed by order. 
 Excuse more - most awfully busy -
