<p>[Letter from Brig. General Charles Rosenthal]<br/>Head Quarters<br/>9th Aust. Inf. Brigade<br/>April 19th 1918</p>
<p>My dear Mr Garling<br/>I was dreadfully shocked to hear yesterday that your son Terence had died of wounds.<br/>Though expressions of sympathy at such a time may seem and are unavailing I should like you and Mrs Garling to know how very sincerely I mourn his loss with you.<br/>From what I knew of him and from what you have told me in your letter you have lost a splendid son, I have lost a personal friend, and the A.I.F. a very gallant Soldier.</p>
<p>I am sure that in your grief the knowledge that he laid down his life for his country and a just cause will keep &amp; sustain you and your wife.</p>
<p>As you are doubtless aware I have for some months been with the Infantry so for some time past have had no opportunity of seeing your son.</p>
<p>Please accept my kindest regards<br/>Very Sincerely Yours</p>
<p>Charles Rosenthal</p>
