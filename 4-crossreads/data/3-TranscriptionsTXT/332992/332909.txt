 Monday April 16.1917 A fine morning.  The papers report more British victories.  We are astride Hindenburg's line &amp; captured 6 fortress Villages.  From last Monday to Friday morning the British captured 13,000 prisoners 285 officers and enormous bounty.  At Ploegstreet (N.W. of Armentieres) a hostile raiding party came under our machine gun fire &amp; failed to reach our trenches.
