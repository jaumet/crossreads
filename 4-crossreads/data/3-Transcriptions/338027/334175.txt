<p>Thursday, 6 May, 1915<br/>On day duty in morning, left hospital at 4 pm back to the camp, everywhere here is excitement, expect to go on Saturday.  Horses went to Abbassia Remount depot only officers and transport horses remaining.  Issued with all sorts of Inf. Kit.  Pay day consequently  a lot celebrated it being last night on leave in Egypt.  Went to O.Rs to bid farewell to some of the best friends I have ever known, it was a tearful good bye, such as I will always remember.  The old corp has greatly altered there being 17 strangers who have come as reinforcements, we hardly know there names.</p>
<p>Friday, 7 May<br/>Had to pack kit bags and saddles before 9 am, it is funny to watch soldiers packing, we are only allowed one change, and the men try to smuggle all kinds of things.  I was detailed off to act as baggage [indecipherable] and took all the kit bags down to Helmich and put them on the train.  I rode home in the lead, it may be my last ride for some time.  Wrote a lot of letters to home &amp; friends, farewell concert at night in the Y.M.C.A.  We are going to be issued with knapsacks, we are all laughing at the idea of walking, and wondering how long we will last on a long march.</p>
