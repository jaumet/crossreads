  
 Than came a big one Storey Building, the ordanance Store.  Than the Hut wher our daily Rationes got issued.  The Post office.  The Store Room & our big Cantine.  Than came the Blacksmith shop & Stables also a big Horse  Guard  yard wher all the Officers Horses wher keept under the the groomage of Germ. Internees.   Hospital   Conist of 6 Wards, each containing 12 Beds also a Camp for consumptive.  This having 2 tents.  We regardet the Hospital with fear, as mostly all wich entered seldom got cured, but came out worse, & in several instances died.  So we generaly called the hospital ,,The Slaughter House".  Medecine given consisted mostly of Pills or Salts, to open the Bowels.  The Dorktores mostly, either dit not know their work, or wher short of apliances & Medecine, as they seldom managed to cure.  The attendance wher of a hurring nature.  A specialist Dentist wich had come under instructiones all the way from Sydney attendet to 42 Patients in 25 Minutes.  The Reader might think me redicoulus, put this is a fact.  Chrismas 1915, on account of Doktor in charge of Hospital going on leave the Wards got cleared, all patients put into Camp amongst those wher our elderly Internee, a Coastal Ingeneure wich suffered with Pneumonia.  These patient on acount being very bad, got a Room for himself alongside the mess Thousea.
