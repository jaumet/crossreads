 
report would signal its message to us. They seemed to be shelling the road which all transport takes to Albert over the ridge & also the observation balloons on the Theipval Sector, which are situated just in front of us. They failed to get the later owing it deflating and being taken away in good time but they made a rotten mess of the road. However as thousands of men are kept busy on the roads not much inconvenience resulted. Our reply will no doubt be given tonight as 4 large Naval long guns have just gone through the village.

Our troops have taken Monquet Farm & firmly held it finally handing over to the Canadians who are relieving us. No more mention has been made of my transfer as yet but I expect it later.
