  
 February 1st 
 same, we were practising signalling out on the desert all day & are on lamps tonight;  This ground we are camped on was the Cairo aerodrome & an aeroplane is still here but have not seen it flying yet; a battalion of infantry belonging to the 2nd contingent & only arrived off the boat to-day,  they arrived here at 4 oclock & two hundred of them had tea in our mess room, we had no lamp practice as we wanted to see if we had any friends amongst them, they were all from Sydney & Melbourne,
