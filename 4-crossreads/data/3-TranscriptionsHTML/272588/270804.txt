<p>Wednesday 20 November<br/>Very busy to-day in anticipation of moving to-morrow, the beginning of our march to Germany.  Very foggy &amp; cold.</p>
<p>Thursday 21 November<br/>Beautiful day &amp; at 9.30 we began our move to Germany, the first stage to Mazinghien about 8 miles being marched to-day. We are now at Mazinghien, a village badly knocked about. Rumours are rife that W.M. Hughes has objected to our going to Germany &amp; that the move is being cancelled &amp; we are going Home at early date.</p>
