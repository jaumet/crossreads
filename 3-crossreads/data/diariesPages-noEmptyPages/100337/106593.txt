Saviour Jesus nailed to the cross, It is the custom right throughout France to have these Shrines placed in all Towns, Cities & Villages & also at intervals along all the main roads.

Monday the 5th of March we had some very heavy snow, which continued to fall every day till Saturday the 10th.

Sunday I again went to Church & after the service the Brigadier General presented medals to a few of the men.

At about 2 o`clock we were lined up ready to receive the parcels & had to march past a photographer who was taking Photos of us receiving them.

The photographs were I think for the Australian papers, I do not suppose
