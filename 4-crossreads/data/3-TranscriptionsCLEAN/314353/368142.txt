The burning log bursts into flame & cries -This is my flowerMy death.
Tagore.
Behind the LinesJ.C. Squire
The wind of evening cried along the darkened trees,Along the darkened trees heavy with ancient pain,Heavy with ancient pain from faded centuries,From faded centuries ?Oh foolish thought and rain.
Oh foolish thought and rain to think the wind could know,To think the wind could know the griefs of men who died,The griefs of men who died and mouldered long ago:"And mouldered long ago," the wind of evening cried.

WarWhere war has left its wake of whitened bone,Soft stems of summer grass shall wave again,And all the blood that war has ever strewnIs but a passing stain!
Events are never absolute:  their consequences depend entirely upon the individual.  The misfortune which is a stepping stone for a genius, becomes a piscina for the Christian, a treasure for a quick-witted man, and for weaklings an abyss.Balzac, Rise & Fall C. Birotteau
