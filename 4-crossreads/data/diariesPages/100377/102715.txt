14th June 1916 
A misty kind of day. Queenslanders went over to Capetown for route march Same programme what we had yesterday. Officer on board troopship in Bay buried today in Capetown. Had a row round the Bay in one of the ship's boats today. Otherwise a quiet day. Rained at night.

Very quiet day. Full dress parade in morning. Another huge laugh at the great military stunt Just got dressed to sit down and reported any loss, and then told to get into fatigue dress. Makes me feel sick at the so called discipline of the "Queens Own. Day was fine. Went on Picquet over for night (2-6) morning (2-6) next afternoon. Took water in from Capetown tugs. Arrival of some armed liner today. Probably an escort.
16th June 1916 
A very fine day. Washing day for Battery. We left Capetown. Weighed anchor at 11.20 am. Our ship sailed off with "Marathon" as mate on the port side and with the "Benalla" "Beltana leading. The HMS Kent being convoy was well out in front. It was a very pretty picture. The four troopers with the Cruiser as escort sailing out of Table Bay on such a fine day. We left the Cunard armed liner "Laconia" at Capetown. Right up to nightfall we kept the same positions so I expect it will keep so till the end of voyage. I think our ship is the fastest of the four troopers.
