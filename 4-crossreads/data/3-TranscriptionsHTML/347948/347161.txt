<p>Various Verses</p>
<p>On the sea &amp; the burning desert<br/>In the land of the ice &amp; snow<br/>Is the man who has left his home &amp; love<br/>Neath his dear old flag to go<br/>For he marched with his colors flying<br/>Though his heart with grief was sore,<br/>Now all that he asks of the ones at home<br/>Is a thought for the past, no more</p>
<p>Standing in its fragrance so Beautious &amp; Bright<br/>Every Ray of hope reflecting back to your dear sight<br/>Make me your heart's Gardener &amp; my care for you<br/>Will Last until your bloom has withered and Life' Journey's through<br/>SYoung</p>
