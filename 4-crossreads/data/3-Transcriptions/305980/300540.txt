<p>1917</p>
<p>January</p>
<p>1:  New Years day &amp; a good one too.  After a starve of six days, received a good issue from Red Cross, so we got busy &amp; made up for Xmas day..  Taubes paid us a visit, but only wounded one man &amp; 4 horses with six bombs.  Still raining &amp; bitterly cold.</p>
<p>4:  Heavy rain &amp; sand storms: only got out of our bivies for feed &amp; water our horses. No lights allowed, owing to expected night air raids.</p>
<p>6:Taubes over at 9 p.m., orders to lead our horses away from the lines.  23 bombs dropped &amp; m.g. playing a lively tune, keeping us out in the cold for over half an hour. Archies opened out to make things worse, caps &amp; cases falling every where &amp; utterly impossible to see the machines.  Not a soul or animal was hit, though some of the bombs went rather close to big targets.</p>
<p>7:  First church parade at Arish, but in the midst of it we were ordered to get back to our horses &amp; take them off the lines, outposts having reported hostile machines</p>
