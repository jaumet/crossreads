<p>Chief Steward &#163;16 2nd &#163;9.10 1st Grade &#163;7.10 2nd Grade &#163;5.10 C Cook &#163;16 2nd &#163;10 Butcher &amp; Baker &#163;12 AB's &#163;8 Bosun &#163;9 Carpenter &#163;10 Firemen &#163;10 Trimmers &#163;8.  Everyone except Purser &amp; 2 W/O's add to this a good deal of overtime each month.  Now for personalities.  The Skipper is a genial man about 50 yrs of age, and were it not that he is rather over developed amidships would be a well built man as he is well set up &amp; has small hands &amp; feet.  He is possessed of a shining bald head about which he passes many disparaging remarks.  He is an excellent host and always has a great store of anicdotes and yarns.</p>
