the same moment. I was glad that I had arranged a fair lot of smoke rounds in the barrage in order to screen our people. The barrage was perfect and Harrick put his men right up under it. When it lifted they rushed the trench and mopped it up for 60 yards. There were about 36 Huns lying or standing in the trench and our chaps killed or left for dead about 30 of them using knobkerries and the bayonet. 6 prisoners of 8 Coy 84 I.R. were captured and sent back. Our party withdrew without a scratch and regained our own lines. A very neat little operation was concluded without loss. The 7th Bde. Got all objectives and we linked up with them on the right flank. The 23rd raid did not succeed and they lost about 13.
