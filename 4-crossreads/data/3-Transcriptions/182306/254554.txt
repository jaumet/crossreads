<p>Still in Suez waiting to take 60 of the Light Horse &amp; some nurses aboard We have the awning all over the decks not to keep the heat out One pf the boats we passed while near Port Said came in today a Dutch Passenger boat which stayed about half an hour and cleared off again but I suppose we will pass it before we reach Colombo. Put on guard to day&nbsp; but not much work attached to it.</p>
