 2. Officers' hospital. This was down in Surrey. The Autumnal scenery there was glorious & we had some jolly fine walks & motor drives about the district. There were about 40 patients at this hospital, including several Canadians, a Bermudian, a South African, a chap from China, another from India, one from South America, a couple of New Zealanders, some English, Scotch & Irish & several Australians. 
 Thus the Empire was well represented. The place was mostly run by amateurs - society people of the County - & their efforts at times in the housework etc were most amusing. 
 I had two weeks' sick leave most of which I spent with friends in Scotland. 
 I got back to France soon after passing the Medical Board & found my battalion down here labouring in the mud.
