<p>window some 300 yards away, is an Egyptian &amp; a saddled donkey.  I watched the <strike>saddle</strike> harness removed from the beast which was then taken a few yards along, several directions were given which made me think &ndash; "Oh! He is bidding the donkey to lie down" &ndash; after a few moments the animal prostrate made attempt to roll, he did not get over, sundry gentle kicks were applied to him but he made no further attempts.</p>
<p>9-5 a.m.  The beast is up again &amp; is being rubbed with a cloth by his driver.  A docile donkey you will remark to one another.  No doubt the saddle will be placed upon his back directly, &amp; mayhap the owner who is twice as big as the animal will be carried up the hill.  The command always rises to my lips when a big man riding on a small donkey passes me &ndash; "Get off and carry him!"  Col. Bird wishes me to go to the pyramids of [blank] ten miles away.  Asked how we were to travel, he replied &ndash; "On a donkey." &ndash; "Oh, no thanks, would not ride on a donkey." &ndash; "He is quite a pleasant beast to carry one." &ndash; "Not for me anyhow." &ndash; Must to the hospital.</p>
<p>This is Monday with you 7-55 p.m., you will probably be upstairs after dinner.  With us 12-20 p.m.  My hospital round has been finished, and as far as I know at present, 1 p.m. for lunch is the next item on the day's programme.</p>
<p>No letters.  Many of us has threatened to make a sacrifice of one of the clerks in the office unless within few days we receive our letters</p>
<p>A new field ambulance has arrived.  Between my window and the village, half a mile distant, the wagons are drawn up, the horses are tethered, the flags are flying, some of the tents are in position, &amp; all is bustle on the piece of ground <strike>alloted to</strike> chosen for them.</p>
<p>Send me copies of your photographs should you have them taken.</p>
<p>Good bye!  Good bye!!!  Good bye!!!!!</p>
<p>Shall post this immediately after lunch with the hope that despatch to you may be early.</p>
<p>My soul crys for blessings upon.  May each of you live long doing much good in the world, leaving it with an honoured name.</p>
<p>My best wishes for my friends.  To Maria my benedictions.  To each of you heaps of love &amp; loads of kisses.</p>
