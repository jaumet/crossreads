<p>with nothing.   I met our Regmtl Q.M. just after I left the dressing Stn. and asked him about my things he promised to send me any articles that I required that were in the pack, so I wrote to him, whether he will keep his promise I dont know.   he may &amp; he may think no more about it.   This is one of the things we have got to put up with, you get a scratch have to go away for a few weeks, when you get back you find that all your stuff has been given away or stolen, nice, I can tell you.   Say I met Ted Mackinson just before we went down to Albert, he said that Charlie Edwards was still going strong asked to be remembered to you then went on.  I may see him again and I may not, we might be camped close to one another and yet might not meet, it is just chance.   I have not heard how our Battn got on yet but I fancy they got a pretty heavy knocking about.   after I got hit I did not wait to make Inquiries, I wrote to the base Re my letters etc but so far I have not received any.   I daresay some will come along someday, 19th was outside the ward, yesterday, first time since I came   A theatrical Coy from Manchester I think they were, came down, and gave us an entertainment "Hindel Wakes."   I cannot give you an account of the play but it was well worth seeing, I will be up again this afternoon and I suppose that next week if I am here I will be able to see a little of the surrounding</p>
