<p>RESUME OF OPERATIONS OF THE 40th WING, ROYAL FLYING CORPS.<br/>9.11.'17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 .11.'17</p>
<p>The commencement of the week found the situation which had arisen at the latter end of the previous week, developing rapidly and air reconnaissance reported the enemy retreating precipitately from the line of the WADI HESI in disorganised columns affording excellent targets for bombing, of which full advantage was taken.</p>
<p>It also appeared that the bombing attack on the aerodrome and station at ARAK EL MENSHIYEH  reported in last week's summary had resulted in such extensive damage to aeroplanes and rolling stock that the enemy were compelled during the night to burn their whole equipment, the remains of 5 machines being observed in the morning; a subsequent inspection of the site confirmed this, the attached photographs showing 4 of the burnt machines, the fifth having been completely destroyed by a direct hit from a bomb.  In addition to these the destruction of the rolling stock caused the enemy to destroy the whole of the stores of the detachment which were found to have been burnt.</p>
<p>On the 9th the aerodrome at EL TINEH was subjected to a heavy bomb attack with equally satisfactory results, subsequent reports from our mounted troops stating that 3 damaged aeroplanes, a damaged field gun, numerous dead TURKS and a quantity of stores had been found at the aerodrome.</p>
<p>Air reconnaissance on the morning of the 10th, reported  that the retreat of the enemy continued but a force of some 2000 troops has assembled in the BEIT JIBRIN AREA and were threatening the right flank of our advance. The reconnaissance at once returned and informed our nearest troops of this concentration but on resuming the reconnaissance found that the enemy had commenced to retire in a N.E. direction, this retrograde movement was confirmed an hour later. The estimate of numbers given by the Observer on this occasion was subsequently almost exactly confirmed by statements of prisoners.</p>
<p>Considerable movement was observed from HEBRON towards JERUSALEM amounting in all to 1200 troops and about 200 horses and motor vehicles.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the retirement still continued but there was evidence that the enemy were preparing to hold a line in the vicinity of KUSTINEH as a rearguard position.</p>
<p>During the day bombing attacks were twice carried out on SURAR JUNCTION with a view to blocking the line, excellent results being observed.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th small bodies of troops were reported to be retiring Northwards but the enemy was evidently preparing to make a stand along the Southern branch of the WADI SUKEREIR, some 13,000 to 15,000 troops being observed on this line which was being hastily entrenched in places. Further North in vicinity of DHIKERIN (about 9 miles N. of LUDD) about 1200 infantry were observed entrenching on the high ground E.  of the Railway.</p>
<p>A large amount of rolling stock was observed in JUNCTION STATION of which 50% were passenger coaches.</p>
<p>Work during the remainder of the day was interfered with by a sandstorm.</p>
<p>On the 12th the situation showed no marked change the enemy were observed to be still holding the WADI SUKEREIR line but had not constructed any considerable defences. Fresh work had been done on the RAMLEH-JAFFA ROAD,  between BEIT DEJAN  and YASER  and at the former place there was a strong redoubt covering the road from JAFFA  to RAMLER &amp; LUDD.  At RAMLER the remaining hangars had been removed from the aerodrome.  During the day a bombing attack was carried out on the railway at SURAR JUNCTION the station buildings being set on fire.</p>
<p>On the 13th the enemy were observed to have withdrawn from the WADI SUKEREIR to position along the WADI some 7 miles in rear with their left flank covering the SURAR JUNCTION, round which some fresh work had been done on the trenches.</p>
