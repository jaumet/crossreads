<p>Thursday, 27.<br/>The bombardment continues. Detailed to relieve Bdr. Rowe, who is ill, as guard at Ammunition Dump, but later detailed for trip to Bailleul. Tip-top!</p>
<p>Went with Logie in evening to farm opposite billets to find out address of a beer merchant and in course of my questions the fermier asked me point blank the number of our division. I replied "Septi&egrave;me, non, dixi&egrave;me."</p>

<p>Friday, 28.<br/>Harness cleaning all day. My set is looking fine now. Picked for guard last night, but did not arrive back from Bailleul in time, so Taylor and I swopped nights. I am on tonight. Reported affair of fermier to Messrs Lewis and Meates tonight.</p>
<p>Tonight one can hear the big guns. The 18 pounders are lost---it is the big stuff.</p>
