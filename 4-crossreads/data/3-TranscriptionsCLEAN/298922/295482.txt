 [The following paragraph crossed through.] You may be surprised to hear that my old nickname of JERRY has never been allowed to die. Tommy Radford started it again & NOWELL uses it. I got it first at  Mrs. BATEMANS . It is a relief to me to know that DOLLY is now provided for. I do not know how much but she has her own home, Furniture etc. & several hundreds a year at least - ISH gave 5000/-/- to relative, but entailed the rest for SON & daughter in equal shares. Have written you fully. 
 Near here is a SHEIKH's Tomb, as in the present so in the past, notable men had large monuments - these are dome shaped [see drawing on image] & painted white by mashing up the PRICKLY PEAR Cactus leaves & mixing with water. Good landmarks to take compass bearings on.
