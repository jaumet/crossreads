11/4/18 - Lavieville
Reached a cellar in the residence of the late Mayor of this village. Here were good beds with white sheets rifled from Madame's deserted linen press. Such a scene of desolation would break anyone's heart ? to think of these poor folk their homes fast being blown to pieces and all their property abandoned to a soldiery. As yet the house is fairly intact but shells are falling all round and there are batteries very close alongside. Had a late supper early this morning upstairs. Did not get up until noon and my batman then had a bath ready for me. Clothes c all lying round
