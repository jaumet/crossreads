Thing are veri live round here this morn , put me in mind of when we were in camp in Kensington in Australia , with all the band and bugl practicis , onli one thing was differ there was no perpetu roll of artilleri nor the score of plane that are at present fli round here , everyth is quiet peac this morn all the tent have been struck line clean up , now the men are lay about in the sun rest , the onli place where there is ani activ is round the cook line Q.M. store here a few men are on fatigu , abov all this scene of quiet the band are play . You can hear tune from all direct the gentl breez float them to us , so take it all round it is a perfect morn , such as onli Franc Australia can show us , such has been my experi Franc in all our opinion has a much better climat than England .
