Marcinelle
Went to see General Martin had long discussion there re Mont St Quentin memorial with Col. Chalmers Major McCall. After met Cols. Forbes and Davis at Bde H.Q. and discussed demobilization questions with the Staff. In early afternoon walked round Charleroi ? the pleasant day made this enjoyable. Barges marked Ghent Rotterdam and Antwerp on the canal and the usual curious crowd watching the locks at work. At 4.30 took afternoon tea with Dr Mathys and ate gauves. Then took them to see the 5th Bde Concert party who were very good but too much for the Mathys to understand. The ?girl" of this party is very good and makes up splendidly. Put all our bad eggs into Charleroi barracks today where they get rough treatment.
