<p>Tues. Nov.  13.  Got Letters from France &amp; Mary B.  My wound is looking a lot better this morning.  The Lady from the Red X saw my cushion cover today &amp; said I must put it in the Comp. which comes off next Friday.  Charley Whitaker came in to say "Hooray".  He went away on Furlough.  The Lights are rotten in this ward.  I intended to write Letters, but went to the Concert instead, which was very good.</p>
<p>Wed. 14.  Well what the deuce am I going to write about?  I'm hanged if I know.  It just seems a matter of eat, drink &amp; sleep.  The cushion cover is almost finished.  The chap (Bandy Joe) came round &amp; took our photos.  All my money goes on Photos &amp; stamps.  I'm broke again now &amp; haven't got a writing Pad otherwise would write some Letters.  Have got quite a lot to answer.</p>
<p>Thur. Nov.  15.  Finished off my cushion cover for M.S.  Hope she will appreciate the many Hours I spent on it.  Got Letter from Rex Herford.  14 more Military Medals.  Our unit will soon be all M.Ms &amp; N.C.Os.  After Dinner, donned my blues, struggled into a Collar &amp; Tie &amp; went for a stroll down the village.  Met Steeley &amp; we went for a walk along the Road.  The Trees are shedding their Leaves &amp; they make quite a carpet of the Roads.</p>
<p>FRI. 16.  This afternoon there was an Exhibition of Needle work done by Patients.  Some of it was beautifully done.  Mr Leek, to whom this House &amp; Land belongs, presented the Prizes.  Afterwards we all had Afternoon Tea with him in the Rec. Room.  My cushion cover was on view, but did not gain a Prize.</p>
