  
 train & continued on, outside of Poperinghe we were stopped & I was uncoupled & the other engine was sent away through [Peselhoek?] on to Bergues & I was ordered to follow it as far as [Balhoe?] & pick up an empty stone train [indecipherable] St Omer & away I went & while my Pilot shunted the train & took water, I paid our old camp a visit, which is practically as our Company left it, the little huts all about were all intact except the doors & windows which had been removed, my own hut had some of the flooring taken away, the large huts were all in good order. 
 After walking through the camp I continued on & paid some friends a visit. A mother & daughter who used to do a lot of the Coys washing, after a chat about old times & a drink of hot milk, the daughter told me that they never moved away, they cling to their old home taking their chance with Fritz shelling & bombing. 
 After the boys had left, the shells were sent over pretty frequent but this home was never hit, & now Fritz is to far away to shell & there is nothing left about worth bombing, it is all quiet & peaceful.
