<p>12/2/16<br/>First parade fighting back to the I.T positions and styles of on guard. The Battalion digging all day except "D" on route march. Revised C.O.'s orders for the defence and the alarm stations. Wrote some letters sending &pound;5 and some photos. To Airlie Avenue. Round to "C" Coy digging trenches and had some range finding on the mekometer with Bazeley. Some good positions for machine guns where attackers would come along through funnel shaped wadis.</p>
<p>Some green succulent small plants in places with small flowers and one with tiny downy seeds. Major Smith brought back a queer bulb with clenched leaves. Pay today. After lunch went out in front putting out timber range marks T200 Ix300 II500. Quite able to control the movements of any of our men from a long way by signal and most can read semaphore. The Australian is smart and knows the reason why every time.</p>
<p>Erected observation post of Hogs Back and garrison it by day tomorrow. Outposts save sentries have fixed bayonets by night. Great keeness over rifle exercises each coy has a team from every platoon and after dark the lads are drilling themselves. Heard one group returning remark "Some b-- good teams in fer this Bill!" "My b-- oath Yes, yer wanter keep yer block" "Yes, yer wanter think what yer doing every b-- time". The prize is P.T 200. Some gift stuff arrived and one fellow tearing along announced he was after the "b-- backsheesh". The small hurdle bivouacs at the head of the lines are comfortable and favoured by those who like their own show.</p>
