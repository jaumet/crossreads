 /9 Sailli 5/4/16 Everi room in the hous we are billet in is full of pictur of sacr heart and crucifix . On most roof a cross is let in in glaze tile and the date as well . Some hous have thatch roof and look veri pretti just like old pictur . After leav Mervill we pass what was evid a munit factori separ from us by a fair broad brook . Upon the grass on the opposit bank buxom wench indulg in amor sport and suggest invit to our men . " By G-" say one " I would n't mind be among them " . " Yes " said the other " but you x lose it swim over " . The men had dread sore and tender feet but stuck it out well the road here take the skin off and we want more harden . Salut of the AIF is splendid and we struck some smart Tommi . My arm got quit tire return salut . The fellow chip the tommi sling off in their own broad way " My , choom , ?ev yer got a Woodbin ? " . We pass an aeroplan hanger all mottl with disguis paint and from then onward the rattl of gun was incess . Pass a well pack cemeteri . Public notic in the street warn the inhabit against gas and there are alarm post . Reach Sailli we clear the town and billet among farmhous . Everyth veri poor and rough owe to ravag of war onli lower class stay about . The road here are marvel good and all day we have been march upon road as good as am Australian suburban street . All glad to reach billet and get boot off the sore chafe feet . We are billet in a pretti spot outsid the town but the hous is squalid and bare and the farmyard stink . Near everi hous along the main road is an Estaminet and in the window are expos for sale lolli and various food stuff . " Debit de Bouisson " is anoth frequent sign but " Estaminet " is the most preval . In the small enclosur in rear of this place stand out among bare tree is a fine pear tree in full blossom , inde , this whole place remind me of an orchard . The flare from German trench can be plain seen around us like a horsesho .
