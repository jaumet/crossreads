Since daybreak this morning we have passed St. Eloi, Aubigny, & St Michel, at the latter place noticing some baths for the troops with many girls washing clothes, & hundreds of socks & shirts hanging out to dry. Evidently we are on the line to Arras & Lens, & not very far behind the front at that [indecipherable].  Germans
