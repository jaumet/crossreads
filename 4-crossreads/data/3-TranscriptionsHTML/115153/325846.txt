<p>Their wounds freshly dressed, and some of them looking as though they were enduring great pain, and others looking as though they were very much relieved to be beyond the range of the guns, which they had faced only a few hours previously. It was now getting near 9 o'clock in the evening, and we decided to wander back to the end of town nearest our Camp.<br/> On our way we called upon one of the many wine-estanimets in the City, and had a few "refreshers" each. If we had taken the road home that we took to come into the city, we should have arrived home fairly early, but we took another  road thinking it would serve us the same, but it turned out to be very much out of the way as we landed in camp at 3.30 a.m. next morning.</p>
<p>The night was dark, and I remember we met a policeman doing his section of a beat which was around a high walled jail overgrown with ivy. We tried every possible means to convey to the policeman the position and circumstances we were in, but it was of no avail, so we trudged on not knowing for certain how far we were from the camp. <br/>Anyway before we went far we met four Frenchmen in uniform who gave us to understand they were on leave, home from the trenches, and who were having a good time with plentiful supply of brandy, and not forgetting their Australian comrades they invited us to have a nip or two. This we did and it did not go amiss, for the night was very cold and the fog was settling very thickly. After we had walked for another hour or so, we quite accidently took the right road into the camp, and then found our tents with difficulty, after which we had about  2 hours rest and were rallied out on to parade to prepare to move off to the railway station.</p>
<p>We of course marched back to the station the way we had marched into the camp. After a good deal of waiting about, we entrained for a place called Etaples, which was at the time, a base depot for Australian soldiers. We stayed here about 2 weeks and did some training, including sham fights and charges up sand hills with full packs and equipment on. Only for the severely cold weather I do not think I would have withstood it. We also had a course in the "Gas School" , and went through various kinds of gasses in tunnels, with our helmets on, in order to make us confident as far as the safety was concerned, with the reliability of our helmets.</p>
