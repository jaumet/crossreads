 Have left South Africa I sit down to write my impress of it . After leav Durban we were so univers unanim about the open hearted of the good British resid there ( and I should add the African too ) that , had I sat down to write at onc I would have "extol to the sky " the South African Republ . But after Cape Town experi I can now write a littl more reserv regard some thing , and I think with a littl less blind enthusiasm . We arriv at Durban about midday Thursday 14th Sept. The Bluff , as the entranc is call , has a fine nobl appear , and remind the Gallipoli lad of the Peninsular hill becaus of the steep side and close scrubbi veget . The harbour is long and river like , and the town lie on the right side , and behind it lie a high ridg known as the Berea , resembl the highland of Mosman Middl Harbour at Sydney . To our surpris the peopl were in crowd on all point of vantag gave us a hearti cheer as we enter . This was certain calcul to gladden the heart of the boy after the long dreari trip , especi as there were mani nice look girl amongst the assemblag . Next day , Friday 15th Sep. , we were given general leav about midday , catch a ferri we soon cross the harbour from the coal wharf near the Bluff , and start to march up town . The column was a long one 1600 men , and as the boy were rather stiff , the march was not too good . We reach the Town Hall , about a mile one half from the ferri , and then were dismiss . Befor be dismiss howev , the Mayor of the Citi extend to us the Freedom of the Citi and announc to us that there would be a Civic welcom to the oversea troop that even , when he would presid ! All tram were free and they refus to let us pay for mani thing in Restaur cafe . There were mani Church societi with Buffet write room and conveni , all ever readi to do anyth possibl for the old slouch hat , and in which we met some of the most whole heart and genuin women it has ever been my pleasur to come in contact with , associ with War work . Hotel were all close , so that the lad behav splendid , and realli one felt proud to be wear the Australian uniform with the pretti street so full of disciplin well behav " Wallabi " , who compar so favour with the garrison troop of the town .
