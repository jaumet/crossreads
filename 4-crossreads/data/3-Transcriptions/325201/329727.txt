<p>One can keep clean down here on this clean sand and as for ones clothes, it is literally possibly to wear one shirt almost ad infinitum. I really cannot complain if hardships this summer; compared with last summer  this has been a picnic. None of those horrible rides all night followed by a blazing day spent trekking over interminable sand while one's water gets lower &amp;   lower, lips crack &amp;  mouths begins to feel like the exhaust pipe of a twin cylinder Indian motor bike.</p>
