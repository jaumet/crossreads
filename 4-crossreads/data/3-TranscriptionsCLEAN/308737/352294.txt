The Y.M.C.A. with H.M. TroopsSaturday 8th May 1915
Darling Mum Nance & Joan,
We are off at last to fight the Turks. We go tonight & are all ready now (5.30pm) Strange to say we are going dismounted - without our horses to reinforce the infantry over there. So we are now temporarily infantry & will go into the fight as infantry I think our horses will follow us. We might be right into the thick of it in a week or less from now & again we might be longer before we see any fighting. However dont worry darlings untill you get news from me per Field Service Postcard which is the only sort of correspondence
