Poor girls had not been so near the firing line   &  could not sleep.
I'm a hardened sinner   &  can sleep through a great amount of noise. Anyhow we had a bad night last night - The Archies were going some so all had to keep in bed with our tin-hats on   &  helmets near. They missed this camp everytime, so hope they will continue to do so. It is hard for the poor patients but fortunately most are too ill to notice much,.
