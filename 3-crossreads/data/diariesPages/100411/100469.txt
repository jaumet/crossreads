The Eng. native part of the town niggs. doss in huts. People live well with beaut nig. servants. Got some Ceylon money little elephant as souvenir. One chap got one about 20 ins. high, a beaut. Not near as much shipping as Port Said. Some of the nigs well educated, speak fluent English. The Cingalese are physically a better race than at the other two ports. They coal the ships out in the harbour off barges. A lot of young nigs scaling about the sides we had some fun with them boxing, singing doing tricks. A very beautiful sunset that evening
