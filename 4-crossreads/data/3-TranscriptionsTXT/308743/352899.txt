Stables as usual, a fine way to commence the new Year.  We are then informed of a review by Georgie Reid.  We marched out at 9.30 & went down to Tura (5 miles) before we turned so as to let the 1st Reg L.H to get in front.  The Sig [indecipherable] as usual was last.  Georgie took the Salute at Maadi station afterwards.  The men were loaded at 4 Q dismounted to be addressed by his lordship.  He was very short and sweet and impressed upon us the greatness of the job that is in front of us.  After lunch [indecipherable] went for a trip to Hebron we got there after a hard ride on the Big [indecipherable] & then we located all the streets and found many of the beautiful buildings I have seen on postcards, after this we went over the mountains on the bikes coming down I struck a stone and the timing slipped we retimed 4 times got home at 5.30.
