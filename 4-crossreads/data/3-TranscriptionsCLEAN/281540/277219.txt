Getting Reg. office sandbagged up to keep wind out, but two windows to be left to allow sea to be seen from here  Remainder of day very quiet spent it reading until 1530 when called to Bde for orders.  Orders issued for a big ruse or demonstration in which the whole Army Corps is participating.  All hands will stand to in dark at 0400 in the morning and on rockets, will belt lead into Abdul.  Then with bayonets and dummies sounds with tins followed by cheers and whistles, orders shouted &c. should frighten 6 months growth out of our coloured friends and we hope to draw their fire - artillery may land them a few ticklers too. 
 Otherwise things tonight are very quiet had a little stale heavy pudding cake for tea and never tasted anything more delicious.  Overhauled rifle and other kit and only hope the barboushes come at us in the morning.  Brigadier Col. Spencer Brown round the cooks asked "What do you do with the bones"  Tough old cook "What  the hell do you know about bones" Brig.  "Well, a shearers cook knows a little". T.O.C. "I was cook on a ship and then had 9 months on a station & can lose any shearers cook".  Gift of cigarettes came to hand yesterday.  3 packets of woodbines per man
