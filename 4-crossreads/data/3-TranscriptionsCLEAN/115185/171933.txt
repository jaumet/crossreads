7 - Australia to convalesce - Thursday - I saw him before he left and gave him a letter to post to Mother when he arrives. I hope she will be able to let him go to the farm for a rest as he has no relations or friends out there. Though Mrs Lee of Bondi he met and has been kind to him. I met a Major McClintock who is on the staff here at tea in Mrs Knox's sittingroom at the hotel next door to this hospital. He told me that he could have arranged for Capt Lloyd to have gone to England on furlough if he had known about him. He said if another case like his cropped up to let them know at headquarters. I was dreadfully shocked to hear of Major Coultmans death from pneumonia 2 weeks ago - here in Cairo - after his splendid service as O.C. of the 1st Batt and safe evacuation from the peninsula. He was a very good soldier, well loved by all his officers and men. Geoffry Street will miss him terribly. I gave them both dinner in our recreation tent the night before they left Lemnos & the Major had a heavy cold then. TheyEMcMillan EMcMillan
