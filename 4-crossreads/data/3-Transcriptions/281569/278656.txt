<p>The CO &amp; myself went out to the catacombs on the motors &amp; after climbing the bare face of the mount eventually gained the summit, inspected the tombs &amp; saw hundreds of mummies, some lately unearthed, others had been up for some time, bones &amp; parts of bodies lay all over the place, had a go at a fox but missed him, he was too far off for accurate shooting. The CO had a bit of trouble with Mel's machine, the clutch again giving trouble &amp; later on his pump connection came adrift, but eventually all lobbed home safely.</p>
<p>Turned in at 10.30 to an accompaniment of wind &amp; dust.</p>
