We are supposed to be in training for a long route march, expect to be leaving this part of the line very shortly. The country is very beautifull again.<br/>Yesterday we went through Stere au Flos, Baraste, &amp; Haplnicourt The ground in places looked like a beautiful carpet.<br/>June 6th 17<br/>Still in Camp<br/>On the night of the 4th an enemy aeroplane <strike>filed</strike> flew over the camp and dropped a bomb it just missed the lines by about a dozen yds, it dropped about 20 yds from me, expecting others to be dropped, it caused a great deal of commotion &amp; nearly everyone ran out of the camp to the open ground, however he flew off, being afraid of the anti-air craft guns. There were five casualties three very slight, two were admitted to hospital.<br/>This morning the brigade has been on a long route march, was very fortunate on duty at phone.</p>
