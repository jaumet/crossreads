of Sandwiches. I passed out and through the Barrier and along to the Special Train waiting and as the Weather was hot and close I was glad to get a seat and have a rest. The long Train was packed and at 7.20 Pm the Whistle blew and we were off to our Camp once again. Once out of London the Train gained speed until we were travelling at 60 miles an hour in several places, cutting out the first 22 miles in 20 minutes, and as the Permanent Way was in good order we had a very comfortable ride, through lovely Country, and pretty towns with it's rows of Pretty Homes, and crossing the Thames several times with its overhanging Trees, passing a splendid Racecourse and getting a glimpse of Windsor Castle with the Union Jack flying from the Flagstaff on top of the Tower. After only two stop's and a very interesting journey we arrived at Codford at 9.45 Pm coming down from London in 2  hrs, all hands detrained and settled down to a three mile walk to No 2
