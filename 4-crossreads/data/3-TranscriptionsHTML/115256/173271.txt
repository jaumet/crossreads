<p>Tuesday 12 January 1915</p>
<p>At 8.30 a.m. this morning, three of our fleet, the "Ceramic", "Persic" and "Seuvic", (all White Star liners) left their places in their respective lines and made off in a south-westerly direction, bound for Aden.</p>
<p>The rest of the fleet is due to arrive at Colombo to-morrow morning.  In all probability, I shall see practically nothing of the town, as we will not go ashore.  As far as I can judge, our stay in port will not be a long one &ndash; perhaps only 36 hours.</p>
<p>The inter-state tug of war, N.S.W. v Vic., the 13th Battalion v the 14th, came off this afternoon.  There was only one pull, and after about five minutes, the 13th team was seen to have a slight advantage, the superiority of the "north of the Murray" men causing general satisfaction among the 13th.  Our 13th officers then "pulled" the officers of the 14th, the "Ma" State once again asserting its superiority over Victoria.  And, although there is ample scope for interstate rivalry on board, any feeling of jealousy is, happily, absent.</p>
