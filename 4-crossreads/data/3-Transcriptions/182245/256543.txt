<p>28 SUNDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; Sunny, but there was a</p>
<p>cold wind blowing off the snow.</p>
<p>Cleaning up round huts &amp; grooming</p>
<p>horses in morning and</p>
<p>exercising horses in afternoon</p>
<p>I did one of Bill Constable&#39;s</p>
<p>shifts of horse picket at night</p>
<p>Got a parcel of handkerchiefs</p>
<p>from M<sup>rs</sup> Lloyd &amp; a letter &amp;</p>
<p>some snaps from Mother.</p>
<p>There was a very big</p>
<p>bombardment at night.</p>
