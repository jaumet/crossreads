24.3.16Fri 24thPut in a quiet day under the palm trees teaching the new hands how to wag a flag;  Sergeant Warden went to Tukh-El-Khail this morning & I asked him to bring out form for me from the Orderly.  I filled it in this evening & took it to Major Smith & asked him to recommend me for a commission as a Signalling Officer & he promised he would forward the form with his recommendation tomorrow;
The Troop had musketry again this morning & a route march again this afternoon;  The weather is getting very warm;  An order came today to say applications for transfers to the Artillery Column would be considered;  Received a parcel of socks, balaclava & mittens from home today.
