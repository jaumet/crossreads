Bailleul is an old town of prewar population of about 13,000. It occupies the crest of an isolated hill and is on the main road from Lille to the coast at Calais. This town has a very quaint town hall built in the 16th Century and a rather fine large cobbled square. Otherwise it is rather mean and squalid. Nowadays however it is of fairly considerable military importance and is a great rendezvous for officers. The old inhabitants make the Bailleul lace. Otherwise the town seems to have few industries, but it is of course the centre of an agricultural district. A YMCA hut and cinema is established there and a hall always houses the pierrots of some division.
