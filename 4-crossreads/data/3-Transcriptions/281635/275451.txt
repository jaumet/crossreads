<p>or four other chaps. Nice &amp; fine.<br/>10/3/18 Sunday Nice fine sunshine. Met chap at Artillery camp other day who came on transport via Panama Canal &ndash; taking 8 hours to go through it; from 6am to 2 pm. They were at Halifax, Nova Scotia 10 days after big explosion. After dinner over 200 of us went out with Chaplain Gault for a couple hours to a beech forest &ndash; planted about 50 years ago. He gave out lollies &amp; cigarettes etc &amp; gave prizes for an essay and competition on"The most beautiful sight I have seen". Some were comic but the winning essays were very good. I did not compete as I have no eye for beauty. After tea</p>
