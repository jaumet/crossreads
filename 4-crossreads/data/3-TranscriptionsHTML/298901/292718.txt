<p>Vendredi 17th Mai<br/>A fairly quiet day.  Our abdominal case getting on well.  He has a wonderful heart &amp; is making a great fight for it.  Learnt today that a case we had who died suddenly a couple of days ago had meningitis.  He was brought to us at 8 P.M. collapsed at 10 P.M. &amp; was dead at 12 P.M. after we had given him oxygen &amp; artificial respiration for some time.  It is indeed a deadly disease.  The P.M. was done at the C.C.S.<br/>Played hockey ay night &amp; won.  Had a swim after, my first for the season.</p>
