<p>FRIDAY, APRIL 25, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Went round the</p>
<p>bottom end of the run in</p>
<p>the morning and round</p>
<p>Hill &amp; Ben Ledi in the</p>
<p>afternoon. Things have not</p>
<p>changed very much since</p>
<p>I left. But from what I can</p>
<p>see things are in a very</p>
<p>big mix up here, &amp; I can</p>
<p>see a lot of work in front</p>
<p>of me.</p>
