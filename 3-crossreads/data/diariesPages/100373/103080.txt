the backs of camels and taken to a place outside the village into small heaps. There it is being threshed in a very antiquated manner. A vehicle, something like a large armchair with a flat bottom, is used. The Yellaheen seats himself on this and is drawn round in a circle by bullocks. It struck one as very funny to see a man seated on one of these vehicles with a huge umbrella held over his head. This was not to keep off the rain but to shield himself from the intense heat of the sun.

A description of what is to be seen in the fields just now near our camp should be very interesting, at least it is very pretty and would require the work of a good artist to do justice to it in a picture.

A small part of the field where the grain is ripe for harvesting there are a dozen natives, men and women and children. Some are cutting the grain, others are loading it on to the backs of camels, whilst some of the older natives are sitting in the crouched up fashion peculiar to them, deep in conversation, and the children are running about playing with one another as children of other countries do. On the part where the corn has been cut, cattle, donkeys and goats are grazing. This with the sand of the desert in front and the green setting behind formed a very pretty picture.
