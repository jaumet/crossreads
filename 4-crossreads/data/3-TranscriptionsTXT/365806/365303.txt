 Kandahar Barracks 
 5.11.16 Dear Father, 
 I have just been looking at some pictures of Sydney harbour.  There was one taken from Woolloomooloo Bay, with Kingsdene flats in the background.  It is only when you have been away from home for some time that you realize what a fine piece of architecture it is. 
 I am now attending a general school at Kandahar Barracks where they teach you everything from the job of a Railway Transport Officer to the intricacies of a P.H.G. gas helmet.  The course is an excellent one except that six months study &amp; experiences are crammed into one months work. 
 The first man I met on my arrival here was Cpt. Jack Mant who is going through practically the same work.  In fact we sometimes attend the same lecture.  If he passes alright, he will probably go into an O.T.C. &amp; get his commission.  He &amp; I went for a trip down to Rollestone yesterday &amp; saw Ginger Allan.  He has been camped at Wool for a couple of weeks, &amp; had only just shifted into the 6th Training Battalion camp
