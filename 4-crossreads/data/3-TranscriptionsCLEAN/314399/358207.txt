  
 Tuesday 29 July 1919 Got the 8.19 to town & the 1.55 to Brighton. Janet met me at the station. We went to the hotel & got a room & then had tea. Went for a stroll along the cliffs came back & had dinner & then all over the race course for a walk. Won't see the dear kid again until she comes home to me. 
 Wednesday 30 July 1919 Up at 20 to 8. Gee I had to go some to get my train to Vic. Went round to Belgrave Sq & put in an app for Janet to come out at the end of April. Saw Trix & had a yarn with her. Got the 12.15 to Warminster & arrived here at 3 pm. Had tea with Bill. The Y.M.C.A. put up a good concert & then an open air dance tonight. Wrote 10 letters & went to be at 11 pm.
