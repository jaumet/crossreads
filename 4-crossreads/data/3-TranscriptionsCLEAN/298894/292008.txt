  
 with no seeming end to it all. Monday 13th. Beautiful weather on duty during morning but went off in the afternoon to get aboard the "Swiftsure". Getting a boat proved very difficult as the Greeks did not like going the long run when shorter runs were paying better. At last I went with some officers & borrowed their boat to continue on to the Swiftsure. I arrived just in time for afternoon tea, rather late so did not stop there long. So after having a yarn, reading the latest telegrams etc. I had to return promising to go again. Arrived back at camp about 7 P.M. Tuesday 14th Two of the 1st A.S.H. chaps arrived & had breakfast with me. This was the first news I had of their arrival so after dinner went along to see the rest of them. In the short time they were at Anzac they had 4 killed & 3 wounded, 17 in all being sent to base. I met 3 of the officers who were in the camp & each spoke of me transferring & hoped it would come off. Plans must have been altered after they left here as they did no
