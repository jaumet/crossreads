<p>453<br/>New Zealand Hospital<br/>Walton on Thames<br/>2nd December 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father<br/>Many thanks for your jolly kind letter of October 19th  I note that my letter from Epsom has most likely gone astray  - Mr Par---ton saw me on Saturday and was very pleased with my eyes &ndash; I haven't got to wear any cover over it inside now &ndash; and only a shade when I go out &ndash; it is gradually getting back its brown colour and I don't think it will be very noticeable when the inflammation is entirely gone &ndash; I expect to be out of here by the middle of the month [indecipherable] youngsters have their holidays from the 18th I will be able to spend most of my furlough time with them &ndash; They have discovered some place in London where one can put up for 31/6 a week. I believe it is close to the Gordon Mc----  wherever</p>
