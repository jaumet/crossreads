<p>is to be the flag ship of the fleet.  I have signed on as storekeeper this time so have a pretty good billet.<br/><u>I</u> will be very glad when we get away from here.  This laying alongside the wharf is just rotten.  I have been wondering where Bert is.  If they have started to fit the Atua up.  Mr Anderson the extra 2nd has taken ill <strike>and</strike> won't be abel to go with the boat now.  They are taking him to the Hospital tomorrow.  So it is hard to say who will be 2nd steward now.  There is a new Chief on board a Mr Marsh.  There is no need to say I am very pleased at the idea of getting away with the boat.  Perhaps I will wish I was out of it before we return but will chance that.  I know I am not on a pleasure trip but what one man can go through.  I won't be far behind.  There is absolutely no news Father will write as soon as I hear definitely when we are to sail.  Now don't worry about me I will turn up some day like the bad shilling perhaps a bit the worse for wear but that is all.  I will write you every chance I get.  I haven't time to write Bert or May but give them all my love.  Tell him I am up to my eyes in work &amp; dog tired.  They will let me off I know.  Remember me to the Miss Smiths.  Love to all.  Your sincere son Clyde</p>
