<p><u>THE CYCLIST SCOUT AHEAD</u></p>
<p>A whistle nags across the yard,<br/>A scuffling rises from the hay &ndash;<br/>A hundred tongues are swearing hard<br/>As only gunners know the way;<br/>We're going 'Up the Line' to-day:<br/>And 'Skeet' and I, both riding light,<br/>Must scout ahead to show the way ---<br/> <u>I broke the 'Two up School' last night</u></p>
<p>The roads are full of hot brigades<br/>That sweat and dodge and conjure hell<br/>To gather to its sultry shades<br/>The crimson cyclist and his bell.<br/>They curse us hard, They curse us well,<br/>To mortal combat they invite;<br/>But we ride on &ndash; the truth I tell! &ndash;<br/> <u>I broke the "Two up School" last night.</u></p>
<p>We find a town in every vale,<br/>A village every half a mile,<br/>A dozen different brands of ale &ndash;<br/>O'er some we sigh, o'er some we smile<br/>The beer of France is often vile,<br/>But oh! The wines of France are bright!<br/>Sometimes we rest a little while<br/> <u>I broke the 'Two up School' last night</u></p>
<p>Far back our column crawls along<br/>They must be ten brigades behind! &ndash;<br/>The Major asks them for a song,<br/>They ask some power to strike him blind.<br/>They thirst, by dusty highways lined<br/>With dusty hedges, parched and white;<br/>We sympathise; our hearts are kind!<br/> <u>I broke the 'Two Up School' last night.</u></p>
<p>The day draws on yet still our star<br/>Reveals some fresh Estaminet;<br/>Madame uncorks the Malaga<br/>"Bon Jour!' says she. "Encore" we say.<br/>(The column wanders far away;<br/>The major in the fading light<br/>Peers up at sign posts, cracked &amp; grey &ndash; )<br/>  <u>I broke the 'Two Up School' last night.</u></p>
