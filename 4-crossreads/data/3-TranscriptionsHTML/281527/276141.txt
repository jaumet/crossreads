<p>21/1/18  Selles</p>
<p>Fortunately the weather has cleared up and a bright sun was shining when 160 men marched out 8 kilometres to Lottingen to carry out musketry on the range down there. Went over to the Battalion parade ground where "A" &amp; "C" Coys carried out artillery formations &ndash; a practice we are very rusty on - and made a good job of it. "B" Coy were in the meantime slogging into the making of a bombing ground. It was a lovely mild and sunny morning and a thing of joy to be alive. McLeish of "D" Co is doing good work and is now an S.B. One of the oldest heads and a good chap. Morey has returned from a safe job to join the boys in the front line once more.</p>
