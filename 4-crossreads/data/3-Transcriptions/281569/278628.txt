The planes have been up several times today &amp; state that the enemy are 50 miles closer today than they were yesterday &amp; was evidently making for Bahnasa, one of our patrols came in touch of a 6 man pat of theres, &amp; a camal detachment was sent out to reconnaitre but no report has come to hand. Went up town tonight &amp; enjoyed our stroll, found an up to date Drapers there in the heart of all the native mud huts.</p>

<p>The weather is still as good as ever.- I had another trip to Bahnasa, I rode down &amp; took my time, nothing much happened on the way down &amp; I got there just in time for lunch set out again at 2.30 everything went well until I was through Beni Mazar up at the Ktoul where after passing 4 buffalo one chased me &amp; I was in heavy sand at the time, I couldn't get up enough speed to get away so I stopped &amp; drew my gun &amp; as he charged I fired, the brute fell like a log, after that everything went well, called in at Samalut &amp; got home at 6 ready for tea, went up the street at night then turned in at 10.30</p>
