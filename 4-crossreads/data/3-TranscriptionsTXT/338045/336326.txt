leave for the front to-night, receive full equipment, rifles, gas helmets etc. & report at 8 p.m., to march out & join their Battalions in the trenches.  Some excitement & now no doubt, the remainder of us will be off shortly to the front at last.  Most important & eventful day so far.  Serves to show that we shall get short notice.
