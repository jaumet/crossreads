T Winter, Rabaul 
Monday 21st September 14
We were given the most honourable position as guard of honor to the German prisoners (damn them too!)
At nine oclock they marched in. First came the 30 German prisoners these after a lot of useless ceremony piled their arms. They all wore kharki uniforms with cartridge belts , slouch hats. After these came about 200 native troops all with their bundles thrown over their backs.
These marched away and we took charge of the Germans conveying them aboard the "Madangi" (the captured recruiter) On the way we had conversation with
