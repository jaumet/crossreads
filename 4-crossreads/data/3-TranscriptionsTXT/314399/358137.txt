 Tuesday 20 May 1919 Left the class today after my driving lesson &amp; went to Kings Cross &amp; got a ticket for Janet. Had lunch with Harry &amp; then went out to see Janet. She has to go to Brighton to see about a job tomorrow so isn't going to Scotland tonight. Violet took Janet's ticket &amp; got into uniform &amp; went. Had the wind up fearfully till the conductor punched the ticket &amp; then she was pleased with herself. We all saw her off. Am going with Janet tomorrow. 
 Wednesday 21 May 1919 Met Janet at 10.15 am at Victoria &amp; we went to Brighton. Cost us 8/6 each 1st class &amp; she got a refund of 12/7 &frac12; for third class return ordinary. Arrived Brighton &amp; found a place for lunch &amp; then went down to the beach. All stones &amp; not at all pretty. Not even as good as Adelaide beaches. Then on to a pier. Cost us 2d each. On the pier are theatres &amp; orchestral places besides all sort of side shows. Then got a train &amp; went out to the hospital. Janet went in while I walked about. She got her job &amp; starts in a month. We then rushed back &amp; had a fruit salad &amp; ice each &amp; got the train back to Victoria. Went out to Bermondsey to see Matron &amp; had dinner with her then back to the flat for her parcels &amp; then to the train. Got a good seat. Once again the guard stepped in &amp; helped us. Real bonny day.
