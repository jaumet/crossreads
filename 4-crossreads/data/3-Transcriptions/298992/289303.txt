<p>get them. I would also like the cutting from the paper of the departure of the 2nd Reins.</p>
<p>I do not think I told you before Mother, but should anything happen to prevent me coming home again, that Insurance money is yours<br/> in full to do just as you like. Now don't think from this that I am feeling down-hearted. I'm not. To tell you the truth I have a feeling that in a year or so I shall be back in Sydney again, and with a big smile up too. I really believe we shall be back inside 12 months.</p>
<p>I do not know if the Censor will cut any of this out, but I believe we have to be careful what we write; any how none of us on board really know when &amp; where we are going &ndash; it is all only surmise on our part. I daresay you know more in Sydney.</p>
<p>It's breakfast now, so Good bye and with tons of Love to you all.</p>

<p>Has Mr Newton been over to see you yet. You must explain to some people down there how it was I could not see them before I went. There were too many to do in the time.</p>
<p>Good-bye Mother. I do not know when I will get the next chance to post a letter. Perhaps somewhere up the Q. Coast. Does Rollo miss me? Give him a kiss.</p>
