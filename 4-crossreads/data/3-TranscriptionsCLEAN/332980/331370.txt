  
 not in their long before it started to rain & everybody had to seek cover, there were a large number of people about with their children, but as it was too wet the Elephants & Llama Rides were cancelled, in between the Showers, I strolled around into several houses containing Animals of all descriptions. One house contained a lot of Australian & South African Birds of all sorts. The Bears Place is built of Stone & raised up from front to back like a Rocky Hill with stone walls around the Sides & Iron Bars in the front & their House at the Back, there were two lovely Polar Bears, pure white & beautiful specimens, the Lion & Tigers Etc are in cages inside a large house which is heated in the Winter, as it was continually raining I made my way back to a Bus & back to the Club & had Tea, & afterwards walked down the Strand to the Garrick Theatre to see the Spy Drama "Pidgeon Post" which was well played, & had a crowded house, coming out  at  after 10 Pm I promenaded until 11 Pm & then back to the Club for Supper & into Bed at Midnight.
