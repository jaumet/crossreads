<p>10.9.16  Sunday</p>
<p>Today has passed without much of any note occurring. We straightened things out a little &amp; I then had a chance to look round a little. We are camped in a little village about a mile from Poperinghe &amp; the same distance from Ypres. Both these Cities are very beautifully built, although there is not very much left of Ypres. It is worse than Albert. Part of Poperinghe are in ruins, but the main part is still intact.</p>
<p>It is curious to watch the habits of the Belgium people, their ways being far different to the French, They all seem to wear the clogs for foot gear in the country villages but in the cities they are beautifully dressed &amp; the women folk all seem exceedingly</p>
