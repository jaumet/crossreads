<p>March, 1915<br/>Tuesday 2<br/>Went Abajsia re nose bags &amp; Remnants.<br/>Horse fell stroke iron, lamed himself &amp; me, camels coming around the corner make horses very nervous &amp; ashphalt roads are slippery.<br/>No wood on the desert so all manure is dried &amp; used. Very few carts all loading packed. Prickly pear is used for wood &amp; cultivated, fewer spines than the Q'land variety. All fencing is made of mud walls &amp; most of the Houses for Natives built likewise.</p>
