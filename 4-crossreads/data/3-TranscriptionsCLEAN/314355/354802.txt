  
 May 17, 18 145. In Sully's Buffet, some friend of his there reading a batch of home letters, finishing one, he turned to Teddy with, 
 "That's a letter a list of people would like to get hold of - it's a letter to my wife from her sister asking her to come and stay with her as long as she likes, but she won't take any money for it!" 
 Says Sully, gently and agreeingly, 
 "Oh most people are like that that are properly brought up!" 
 May 18 146. a.m. Early, to the R. of Meteren the 5th raided for identification, there was a barrage over the raided trench, so perfect that most of the funk holes and shelters were blown well in, but it was an empty front line that was shelled and raided!  Nine of the raiders through early, one with a vivid telling of excitement. 
 "The first hole was empty:  I put my bayonet into the next and struck something soft - thought I had him! it was a waterproof sheet, and all of a sudden I was blown up into the air, landed, and somebody grabbed me shoulder strap - started to cut it off!. "What the bloody -" "Who's that?" "Dunstan!" "Christ I thought it was!" "Everyone seemed going all over the place:  we made back to the flare - it went out and the M.G. opened, back over the trench, then into a strongpoint." 
 If Dunstan had read Pepys he'd have inevitably ended - "and so to the R.I.P.". 
 May 19 147. a.m. Yesterday morning with Watts to H.Q. and a leaving there of boots.  In the Billet Capt. Neeve brought over to me some paper for "Ghutz" - good bright surfaced stuff and over a hundred sheets. 
 Till an hour ago from 9 last night printing front page - "Salvage" by Sharp and compleating drawing of back page:  50 copies of front page completed:  Basil to go down today to H.Q. to fix for typing. 
 Yesterday a day of hot burning sun:  in the late afternoon to the Borre church, and a sketching of plan on next page:  a plan interesting from its suggestiveness, from the pulpit all the church well within range of voice and vision.
