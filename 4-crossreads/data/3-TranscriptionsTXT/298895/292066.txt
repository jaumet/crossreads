to get ready to move off at an hours notice so we packed our wagons that night.  It came as an absolute tonic & I was as happy as a King until I had an argument with the Q.M. over a water tester he saying it belonged to A Section when I knew it belonged to my section, even his crawl down an hour later did not quite square me up.  For a farewell evening four of us bought twelve bottles of Bass & some biscuits & had a "hop over" in other words & a good time.  We decided to turn in about 2 A M, but before doing so decided to let the S.M's tent down.  Unfortunately the wooden floor it had prevented it from collapsing altogether & he was able to get out & fix it up.  We had a great old laugh, however seeing him come out in his pyjamas swearing at the silly -----etc.  Great aerial activity at night it being moonlight.  Bombardment heavy.
