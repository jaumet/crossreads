<p>Yesterday we had an all-day stunt.  We went to Wollop, a village near here, &amp; had our rations at an inn supplemented by beer, cider &amp; sloe gin.<br/>During the day we marched 20 miles &amp; had a very enjoyable time.<br/>Today we were drilled for some hours and informed that we are to make part of an emergency ambulance to go to Bulford next Tuesday for the Kings Review.<br/>That will be a new experience, to be reviewed by the King, but it will be rather tiring I fancy</p>
