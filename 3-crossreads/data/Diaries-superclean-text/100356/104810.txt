Stables as usual my mare is as usual lame but is getting well by degrees, had to send to Kattaba for oil as the CO's going to El Bookir in the morning, so Charlie left after dinner, Mel I tuned up our scraps mine has a blow hole through the cylinder nothing much only an occasional weep or so. The natives proved troublesome at Absassia yesterday the Heliopolis troops were ordered to stand to arms but nothing eventuated. All the natives have been mobalised so as the authorities know where they are, when the fun commences, two more falls yesterday one from the stirrup pulling out the other a clean throw. They are carrying 2 days rations tomorrow spare petrol also all sorts of firearms.
