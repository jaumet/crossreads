<p>right of Flers. This village is not damaged much by shell fire.</p>
<p>31/10/16<br/>The rain has cleared after about a fortnight's drizzle.</p>
<p>The enemy shelled our position this afternoon. Some of the shells landed uncomfortably near our dugout. One which wounded 3 of our chaps set fire to a small bomb store about 18 feet from us and caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>We expect to be releived tomorrow night and remain out</p>
