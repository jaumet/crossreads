 you a better indication as to how things are going. &nbsp;I&#39;m pleased indeed to know everything is panning out so well. 
 Did the Nurse take a photo of wee Peggy? &nbsp;You didn&#39;t mention her in your last. 
 I think I have had all the money you sent over. &nbsp;I&#39;ve a nice wee balance over here at present, and will come in handy if any more leave comes along. 
 I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got all the cards. &nbsp;Did you get the registered packet I sent just as I was going on leave,. &nbsp;Here&#39;s a few more, and I&#39;m hoping to get a lot more of the latest sets. 
 I hope you are in the best of nick and kept going at 87. 
 Sincere wishes for a Happy &amp; Prosperous&nbsp;New Year. 
 Your loving Cousin 
 John.
