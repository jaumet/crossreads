<p>The 14th came out early &amp; relieved us.  Bricky &amp; I reported at the A.D.S. where they took our Temps.  Bricky was 101.2 &amp; I was [indecipherable]  The M.O. told us to go straight to Bed which we did &amp; stayed there till Sunday morn.</p>
<p>Sun. Nov.  3.  Capt Nance came to see me after Break &amp; ordered me to be evacuated.  Took my gear down to A.D.S. (with the assist of Les Townshend) where we were given a drink of hot cocoa while waiting for the Cars.  They took my boots away &amp; only left me my pack.  After about 2 hours waiting I got away in a car to where the 5 F. AMB are.  Here we got more hot coffee &amp; were examined by another doctor who marked our tickets C.R.S. or C.C.S.  Mine was marked C.R.S.  After waiting here for about 3 hours we got another ride to C.R.S.  Here we were [hustled?] into a Tent &amp; saw another doctor, who sent us away again, after asking a few more questions.  Eventually we were issued  into in a Tin Hut holding about 20. Here we we shown to a place on the hard floor to sleep.  Very nice quarters for a man with a Temp of 102.6.  My pack went astray somewhere while I was at the 5th.  Sent a note on to Capt. Nance &amp; asked him to enquire about it.</p>
<p>Mon. 4.  Very restless last night, what with the hard floor, the chats &amp; wondering what had become of my pack.  The Orderly took our T's about 6 a.m.  Mine was 100.6  Had Bread &amp; milk for Break.  Doctor came round about 10 (Maj. Russell) Took down a few partics. &amp; ordered me to stay in Bed on a light diet.  We had no fire in the Hut &amp; it was mighty cold.  The 6 F. A are running this place.  They only came in a couple of days ago &amp; the place is anyhow.  The patients were rushed in on 'em before they were ready.</p>
