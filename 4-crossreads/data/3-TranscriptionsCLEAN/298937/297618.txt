  
 Dr Voss was relieved & Dr. Van Epen of Lismore sent in his place a couple of days ago.  As he has to attend another dispensary at No. 2 Stationary Hospital we don't see much of him. We have two big marquees & a bell tent. The latter is for our accommodation, one of the former for dispensary & the other for observation cases. The heat is still terrible.  I feel sick of Egypt & when we move off I shall be heartily glad.
