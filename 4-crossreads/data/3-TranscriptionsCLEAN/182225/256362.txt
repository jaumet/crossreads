1916   THURSDAY 31   AUGUST
Fine but cold. Out signalling all day & had a lamp parade at night. On the guns for an hour in the afternoon but did nothing. We got our [Yancoos?] out & sent some away. I got a letter from mother & one from Alan with my photos taken in Rotten Row. Heard that [Ooll?] Buckland had been killed in Egypt am sorry as he was a white man & a better mate no man ever had.
