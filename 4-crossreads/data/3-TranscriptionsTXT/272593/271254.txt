B Coy. saw what we were up to & got ready to meet us,  we attacked in two waves Capt led the first one & I the second, off we went & if ever there was a mix up well it was here  the air was simply thick with flying snowballs, & in a few minutes we were all white with it, after they stemmed our rush they tried to capture the Capt & we all rallied round him & belted away as if our life depended on it,  Capt Jacobs hit me fair in both eyes
