<p>THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Got a car and went</p>
<p>out with Lalham &amp; inspected</p>
<p>some of the state Forrests for grass</p>
<p>was away all day but most</p>
<p>of the places have been eaten</p>
<p>off. Went to the Pictures with</p>
<p>Hall at night and caught</p>
<p>the 12.30 AM train for Maitland.</p>
