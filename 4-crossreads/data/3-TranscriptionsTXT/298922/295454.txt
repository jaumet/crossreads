 Tuesday 8 May 1917 
 The Turksbombed the Red + Hospitals at Railhead last night &amp; used their Machine Guns. Of course the whole of the Hospitals were lit up &amp; made an easy Target. Up to  know  now JACKO always played the game, it sounds like German influence. The Crops are now ripe &amp; grass seeds falling (blankets full of them). SCORPIONS &amp; SNAKES plentiful, about the old ruins &amp; in the WADIS but climate cooler than Egypt. 
 I've not had my boots off at night for 3 weeks now. 
 Was given some INK last night so Pen goes again.
