The landing will be made good by the help of God & the Navy: the positions will be stormed and the war brought one step nearer to a glorious close."Remember" said Lord Kitchener when bidding adieu to your Commander, "Remember" once you set foot upon the Gallipoli Peninsula, you must fight the thing through to a finish."
