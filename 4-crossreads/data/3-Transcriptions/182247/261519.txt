<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Parade 9.&nbsp; Felt off color.&nbsp; Did company drill for an hour, then set out for a swim to the pond at Avaloy.&nbsp; Had our swim.&nbsp; Enjoyed it immensely.&nbsp; Much struck with the beauty of this pretty place.&nbsp; Set out for<strong> </strong>Bouzincourt in charge of Lt Clarke.&nbsp; Led us home a different route to that by which we came with the result that we got lost and about four miles out of our course.&nbsp; Eventually arrived home sick, sore and sorry.&nbsp; Arrived 1.15 dead beat.&nbsp; It seems strange to be in a village that bears no imprint of the savagery of the Hun.</td>
