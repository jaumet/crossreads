<p>arranged to go tomorrow. Went back to dinner at the hotel &amp; then went to the Empire Theatre to see Grand Opera. It was "Lurline" &amp; was played by the McNally Grand Opera Coy.  Both Bill and I enjoyed it. It was a far better Coy than we gave them credit for at first. After the show we went to a Fish &amp; oyster saloon called The Dive &amp; had a feed &amp; then went home to bed.</p>
<p>Saturday. 19.10.18<br/>Got up about 9.30 &amp; did the usual (shave, bath &amp; brekker) &amp; then went down to the brewery arriving there about 11am. Got a book on the place &amp; a guide was provided we went all over the place. Met Reg Downey &amp; his wife there &amp; they came over with us. Gee it is a magnificent place &amp; covers acres. Think it marvellous. They have all sorts of brainy ideas for saving labor. They have a narrow gauge railway all over the brewery &amp; when the engines are required to pull the broad gauge trucks, the engine is lifted completely off the narrow</p>
