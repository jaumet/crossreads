  
 23 August 1918 Friday A fairly heavy breeze & a rising sea getting up to quite a considerable roll by bed time. Nothing extraordinary though - just a few things being dislodged (seasick ch - Serg?) R.M. 
 1918 August 24 Saturday A nice fine day & the sea has calmed down considerably only a small roll now running. Nothing of importance to note.
