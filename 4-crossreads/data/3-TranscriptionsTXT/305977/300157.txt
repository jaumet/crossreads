were sorry to lose him as he was a good fellow.  His only fault was that he was too easy going.  We got Sgt Tresilian in his place.  Worked fairly solid in the afternoon washing out all the horse stalls & [indecipherable]washing afterwards.  More boxing again at night.
Friday 8thUsual work on stables all day.  Hot muggy weather with showers.  More boxing at night.  Some of the finals were put through.  Pickering & myself mess orderlies.  Mail day.  Flagship took the letters off.  I wrote one letter home.  Was vaccinated today.
Saturday 9thStrong head wind blowing.  After inspection several of us were late on the 11.30am parade & got 4 days stables at reveille.  Had to put in stable piquet at 6pm.
