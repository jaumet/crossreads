 Hun snipers opposite. Indeed and ineffective shot was fired at the man immediately following us, but we safely reached the trench, and keeping low made our way along the narrow passage through the slush and mud. Presently we came up to the officer on duty and he pointed out what there was of interest at this spot. At the point where Lt.Col. Howell Price of the 3rd Bn. had been shot good observation was obtained, and after I had looked out to refresh my memory about the outstanding features, Gen. Glassfurd poked his head up to see things for himself, and almost immediately a sniper's bullet whistled past within a few inches of his head,- a very narrow escape. It was a reminder that the light was now good and thereafter we had to go cautiously. Making our way along the narrow trench occupied by one of the battalions of the 3rd Bde. it was fine to notice the cheery smile and hearty word the General had for the men  standing to arms. The Co. Commander did not put in an appearance in spit of my message, but we could not wait and after going along nearly the whole of his front we made our way back to Cheese Rd. by one of the communication trenches and here had word that the CO. Commander would be along soon. A dug- out lover evidently! However the General would not wait and we went along Cheese Rd. to the entrance to Chalk Trench, meeting here 2or 3 men coming up from Bn.H.Q.  They were coming along the parapet and said that the Trench was very muddy and going along the top quite safe. I asked the General what he wished to do. He unhesitatingly chose the top so we set off, myself leading, then the general and after him the orderly. Scarcely had we gone 20yds. when there was a whistle smothered by a bang of the exploding shell and I was conscious of a sharp pain in my left arm and realised that I was lying twisted up some distance from where I had been standing, with something warm soaking my shoulder and chest. On looking round and attempting to rise I saw the General lying 15 to20 yds. away and called to see if he was badly hit to be met with enquiries as to my state. The orderly was lying a shapeless mass some 20yds. further away, the 4.2H>E. shell having landed almost at his side. Fortunately the men whom we had met were in Cheese Rd. near by and I called to them to lend a hand to the General  at once. A fragment of shell had penetrated the thigh and passing through the abdomen had lodged in the kidney. As the slow barrage continued and shells kept landing in our vicinity the men carried the General into a dilapidated trench running along the Cheese Rd. embankment and I sent an urgent message to the Co.H.Q dug &ndash;out.
