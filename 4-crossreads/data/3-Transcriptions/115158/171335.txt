<p>Sept. 29&nbsp; Sept. 30</p>
<p>September, when we left for Scapa Flow to carry out gunnery &amp; torpedo exercises.&nbsp;There was little fresh at Scapa Flow, with the exception of a few new additions to our already powerful Battle Fleet.&nbsp; Here we heard that the most successful destroyer of German submarines, was a new type of ship which was allowed to roam the seas at will, to change her flag as convenient, &amp; alter the colour of her funnels, and even change her name as often as she wished.&nbsp; Also she had hinged sides which could be hinged down to the level of the deck.&nbsp; Behind these hinged sides were several quick firing guns.&nbsp; The crew were were dressed after the fashion of a nondescript merchant service crew.&nbsp; When ordered to stop by a hostile submarine, she would heave to, &amp; when a favourable opportunity presented itself, down would go the sides &amp; every gun would blaze forth, much to Fritz&#39;s surprise &amp; disgust.&nbsp; In this way many German submarines had their career unexpectedly cut short.</p>

<p>After completing our exercises, we left for Cromarty, a journey of only 5 hours, &amp; here we waited for 3 days until it was clear enough to carry out long range firing, in company with the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;.</p>

<p>This completed, we left for Rosyth.&nbsp; A few hours out from Cromarty, 5 strange vessels were sighted</p>
