 My Darling Wife 
 You said in a recent letter that you'd love a peep at my diary. 
 Well, I have kept a diary of sorts, from the first time I went into action properly &ndash; kept it in shorthand, and when I was in the field ambulance at the time of my being gassed I tore out these leaves &amp; have carried them ever since. 
 Here in England I have copied some out for you and am sending them, as I know you would be interested. 
 I took 20 men up on Messines Ridge on a working party.  We had no Officer, and we lived in a muddy and very verminous old trench for 32 days without a break, and under continuous but intermittent shell fire, and never had a casualty, though other fatigues had them every night;  a wonderfully lucky run. 
 Your Loving Gel.
