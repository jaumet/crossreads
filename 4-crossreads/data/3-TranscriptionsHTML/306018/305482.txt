<p>January February 1918<br/>I could not promise, although Todd wanted to go. Madame is a widow with means &amp; rather good looking.  I told him I had to look after the interest of my cousin.  Next day Sunday [3rd Feb.] we went out to Mena House to have afternoon tea with Mrs Cornish, who is staying there.  She has a suite of rooms &amp; Miss Burness  &amp; the children are also there.  We had a pleasant afternoon.  Long &amp; Boyle were there.  Long took several photos on the verandah.  We stayed till after 7. motored back to down at all had dinner at the National Hotel.  After dinner we went into the drawing Room.  Todd started to play &amp; soon had quite an audience including several civilians a few young girls I noticed there too.  When Todd got the dance music going they started dancing &amp; we kept it up for about an hour.  About 10.30 some Australian officers came in including the AIF official artist</p>
