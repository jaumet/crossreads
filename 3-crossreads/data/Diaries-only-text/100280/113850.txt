those who tried to get up that deathtrap for it was nothing more nor less, for the last men had to expose themselves more than the first who went through for they had to rush over the dead who were already in the trench, how they never jerried to me beats the band for I must have been easily seen but only an occasional bullet a few shells came near me. however when I finished I only had 8 rounds left in my pouches so you can guess I had a few shots.
