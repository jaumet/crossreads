<p>or two pairs and every body has got tons of sox now so you cant give them away; so what can a person do? Of course if we don&#39;t move much I will be able to keep them till I want them. We have nearly eaten the honey and it has been nice and has let us catch up splendidly with our Jam issue - while I think of it will you please send me a water-bag for next summer, one to hold about 1&frac12; to 2 quarts and to hang round a horse&#39;s neck. I found one late last summer which held really well and it was a great success those we were issued with at Romani were no good at all, took too much water to keep them going.&nbsp; I wonder how Father got on about James&#39; place - By Jove it would be great to get it - would make a dinkum &quot;estate&#39; out of home then. I had to put &#39;dinkum&#39; in there Mother because reall would sound too much like a house and land agent you know. We are still having most beautiful weather, and it is pretty here - I really think it is too nice a place to want to get leave from - so I think I will leave it till we get to some worse camp.&nbsp; Love to Father, Hal and Freddie and yourself, Mother.</p>
