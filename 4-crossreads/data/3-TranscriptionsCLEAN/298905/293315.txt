As I write this the boy's are kicking the football about & enjoying themselves in the nice sun.You should see the old French people collect round our incinerator when we are moving they generally get some good articles for there is always a lot of  good stuff wasted when we are shifting about from place to place.Last night there was a fight between our aircraft & the Germans I don't know how it ended up, but our fellows chased them till they were out of sight.I hear Captain Price is getting the D.S.O & Lieut Moffatt, the M.C. I dont know what for something to do with the raid I supposeLeft our parade ground this afternoon at 4'oclock & marched to Bailleul, she is a nice little town, & there are some solid buildings in her streets
