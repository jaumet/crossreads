 Tuesday 10.10.16 On piquet till 4 pm.  Very quiet day in every way.  Spent evening in Y.M.C.A. 
 Wednesday 1.10.16 Walked out to A.D.S. at Houplines which is being run by B. Section Tent Division.  Debate in Y.M.C.A. at night, Conscription V Anti Conscription, feeling appears to be strongly for no conscription.  Did 12 to 2 AM. shift on piquet on account of one of the lads not being too well.
