<p>Well &amp; how are you &amp; Graham &amp; the Boss &amp; Mac.  I expect Graham is getting huge &amp; is quite a man.  I would like to see him.</p>
<p>I hope the Boss is well, tell him I saw Claude Nowland yesterday he is all right again &amp; back here.</p>
<p>I haven't been to Paris yet hope to get in September D.V.</p>
<p>What sort of a winter had you &amp; how is the garden.  Is the diminutive jackeroo still there &amp; is Sarah still tripping about.  The dear old soul, she was good to me.  And Ma Gibbons &amp; Paddy how are they?  You don't know how I'm simply hungering for all Tog &amp; its works.</p>
<p>And the things I'm dying to tell you &amp; can't on paper.</p>
<p>Well I must flee, I'm getting busier every day.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; best love to you all &amp; specially yourself.</p>
<p>Yours as ever,<br/>Wilkie</p>
