 The officers usually are located in houses of the inhabitants, the troops in any sheds or stables which are considered  as  useless for the shelter and comfort of their horses or cows. 
 The billetting officer then should be in a position to acquaint the officers in charge of the arriving troops, where the billets for the said troops are located. 
 This, or something like this was in the minds of the authorities when in their wisdom they created the position of &quot;billeting officer&quot;.
