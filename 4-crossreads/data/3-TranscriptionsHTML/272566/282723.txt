<p>Thursday 6 December</p>
<p>Frosty &amp; bitterly cold.<br/>Big run to 1st Anzac Corp. after dropping the usual returns at Dranoutre.  Took a new course today from Dranoutre to Bailleul via Neuve Eglise road &amp; Ravetsburg.<br/>German Planes busy tonight &ndash; one came under the concentrated flares from our searchlights &amp; an antiaircraft shell got him.  It was a pretty sight to see him fall in flames.  Many bombs were dropped</p>
