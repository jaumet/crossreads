<p>Rather hurried notice this morning  Reached Boulogne a 1 o'clock  Went to Wimereaux and spent a few hours with a few of the Original unit of No 2 A.G.H. to which we were attached when we left Aust-</p>
<p>Left Boulogne at 8.30 p.m. for Paris and travelling all night we reached Paris at 7 a.m. After having fixed up the necessary formalities at the Pepinere Barracks and there getting a lecture on avoiding loose women in the streets of Paris of whom the streets of the city abound, we made our way to the hotel D'Iena, a hotel run by the Canadian Y.M.C.A. for the benefit of the troops on leave to Paris.</p>
<p>The accomodation and food of this hotel was very good indeed<br/>Aug 12th.  After having a hoth bath and a general clean. up, Bill and I walked to the Eiffel Tower, a magnificent, but yet delicate looking steel structure towering up into the Sky 1000 ft. To get to it we had to cross the Pont D'iena, one of the thirty seven bridges which cross the River Seine at Paris. The Eiffel Tower is at present used as an Wireless Telegraph station so that we were not able to get to the top of it and to get the magnificent view which one ought to get from the top of the tower.</p>
