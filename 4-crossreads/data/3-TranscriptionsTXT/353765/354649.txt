April 1917Four of them flying very low passed & circled round above us time after time while on bank of Wadi made us feel very uncomfortable. but he respected Ground R.C. flag this time. Again at 1 pm shifted further down & on good site & picking off barley for horses. Managed to get a bath or wash again. Good snap of camp. 4.30 pm we moved further in towards Khan Yunus & at 3.30 next day (21st) took over from NZs at Weli Sh Nuran. Nuran was formerly very strong Turkish redoubt Trenched & Tunnelled deeply & closely, in fact  &work of it, made practically as impregnable as E. works can be made. Wire etc of course removed by them. Native cemetery here & skeletons distributed by Turks in their work. One skull was mounted on a pile of stones & we put X bones on it & took the photo of it. Later on  put a cigarette in his mouth. On 28th Went to Belah with McLean & pack horse for mail drugs etc28th - Khamseen [Khamsin, hot dusty dry wind] blowing 25th-28th everybody hot dirty & miserable. Temp 123  in shade at Belah. Returned next day & found camp in almond orchard. Dead horses I think responsible for move. Camp decidedly better. 26th inf took couple of redts. Cruiser would rushed in & plant about 60 in 5 mins on the places & the inf. take them Jackos then either dead or buried. Monitors doing good work. One came close in & blew up a Turk amm. dump near Mosque in Gaza. Then a Turk land gun put one right in centre of monitor which only seemed to glide off. Monitor returned & first shot blew gun gunner & all to atoms.1st May - On May 1st we shifted to another Turkish position in another almond orchard nearer Tel el Fara. Fleas & lice galore. Glad to get out. Bomb proof pits D.O's for horses & men & all other defences here also. Cactus hedge surrounding.
