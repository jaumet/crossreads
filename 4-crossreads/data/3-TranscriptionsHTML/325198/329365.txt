<p>15 Sept, 1916<br/>Bir El Hassaniya<br/>Its 'Ot" as the proverbial "Obs", to day. now &amp; then a breath of wind puffs along &amp; feels cool &amp; nice against ones sweaty face  To night we start out on a stunt.  We are going to look for stouch.  Some one has an idea that Abdul is longing for a chance to toss in the sponge &amp; take a trip over the canal, I wonder?  We are carrying 60 Rds amm extra to help to persuade him that the desert is a very unhealthy place to live in.  Thirty miles out!  Wont it be a real joy ride in for the wounded.  We are supposed to attack Sunday morning &ndash; I believe my horse is still doing a fast.  I had to pet him &amp; call him horrid names in the most soothing tone to coax him to deign to drink too buckets this morning &amp; he ate a few mouth fuls of grain I pinched but guess he'll come at it later.</p>
