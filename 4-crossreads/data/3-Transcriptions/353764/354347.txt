<p>Today we passed within Steaming distance of Cocos Islands but did not see anything.  Fairly heavy Seas running.</p>
<p>Friday 3rd Dec 15.<br/>Fairly heavy Seas still running  Had a mock "Fire &amp; Collision" Alarm to test us &amp; every man was at his post in 10 minutes, Life Belts on &amp; everything complete.<br/> Boats were ready to lower &amp; Rafts ready to throw overboard.<br/>Still very sick from effects of Inoculation &amp; Tropical Heat, which makes one feel very Sick.</p>
<p>Saturday 4th Dec 15.<br/>Weather very hot.  Concert came off last night &amp; proved a great success.  Sea very calm,  rained very hard this morning, Tropical Showers very frequent in this latitude.  One of the peculiarities of this place "The Tropics" is the great number of Shooting Stars, each one lighting up the whole sky.</p>
<p>Sunday 5/12/15<br/>Another hot &amp; sultry day.  Held Church Service on Board, which was appreciated by everyone.  Ran into Schools of Flying Fish, one of which flew on Board.</p>
