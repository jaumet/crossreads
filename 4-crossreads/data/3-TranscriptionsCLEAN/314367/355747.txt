  
 Part 8 To Feb 3-15 
 PS.  You ask about Fitz's rank - He is a senior lieutenant - plain Mr on shore - at sea  by courtesy  - Commander or Captain or C. Officer - He's an egoist - I like him & we get on well together - as a navigator he knows his job & all of us have great faith in him - In an emergency I think he'd be cool & collected - Its Friday 6th - We shall be back in Rabaul by 10 am - Its 6 am now - Weather very fine but hot - We've to coal - It may be the end of Feb before we get to Sydney so don't worry -
