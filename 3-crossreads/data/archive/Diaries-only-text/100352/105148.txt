heaving of the gun sight overboard has been reduced to very small uninteresting dimensions now. We have been robbed of the spectacle of seeing the "culprit" shot as a spy, as it now turns out that the sights were left behind at Cockatoo Island. But there are vivid imaginations on board so that we may not yet be robbed of this pleasant little drama.
I shall have to refrain from noting changes in the menu. The cooks sprung a huge surprise on us at dinner today by giving us "green" peas. Another rumour is also to hand that we are to have Cockie's joy for supper But it is probable that this will also be reduced (it certainly will not be made any wilder) during the next few minutes.
