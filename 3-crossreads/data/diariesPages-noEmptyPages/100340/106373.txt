very short but all the same I will have my photo taken again when I go on furlough. Do not expect to be in hospital more than a week although it will be about two months I reckon before I get back to my unit. Well dear give my love to Vol Noni. I suppose young Noni is quite a girl now can point out her old uncles photo. We are still having very decent weather although it has rained a bit for two days. Well dear old Sis that is about all my news so will conclude with fondest love kisses from your loving brother Hal
