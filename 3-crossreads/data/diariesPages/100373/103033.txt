A few of the places we visited were the Victoria Gardens, Museum, a Buddist Temple, the Barracks, the native quarters, and on our way round we passed various bungalow buildings which were said to be clubs of the well-to-do. The sight that interested me most in my visit to Colombo was the native quarters. They are a strange medley of human nature, these people who live their. To see them in their little tumble-down shops or rather recesses open to the street and having for sale all kinds of unknown stuffs for food etc. was to our eyes very funny and very interesting. The buildings of the whole place had rather a dilappidated appearance. This applies to the native temples also.

The idea amongst the native priests seems to be to extract money from you, and all manner of dodges to this end are made. You have to take off your boots outside the door of the temple, a little boy will look after them for you, if you pay him. Another will do the same with your hat. There are various boxes for offerings and the priest is up to his work in getting the money out of you for these charities. Long practise with this faculty makes them experts at the game.
