<p>15.6.18<br/>Usual parades.  Lovely day.  At 9 went for hours route march with Tuck round &amp; home through forest and paid on return.  Infantry moving up and our advance party goes up to-night and we move to-morrow.  However, orders changed and had tea at 4 and moved at 5 through Hazebrouck on to pontoons to reserve camping ground.  Camped in trench and put ground sheet over our heads.  Just before dark Robb took us over about half a mile away &amp; showed us trench we were to occupy if an attack came and to organise the infantry.  Great fear of him coming over in the morning and tales of his massing going round.  Very cold sleeping and only one shell and a couple of bombs were heard all night.  Extremely quiet.</p>
<p>16.6.18<br/>Breakfast at 7.30 and spent morning getting mobile and writing letters.  Fine day and cool west wind.  Yesterday propaganda balloons were being sent over all day from right of us &amp; back of Nieppe forest.  Some showers during morning which prevented letter writing.  Moved at 4 and back to old billets quietly and spent rest of evening cleaning up mess left by 2nd Coy.  Work at 9.30 and out with Price &amp; rest of section except Sarre, Edmonds</p>
