 Saturday 29-7-16 Our Squad was sent up to the line fusing Bombs last night.  I was among 10 who were left behind.  The Bombardment last night was awfully grand.  Every kind of Gun & shell being employed.  The 7th  Brigade got an order to retire & finished up among the Artillery.  It transpired later that there was a misunderstanding.  Birthday today  [40th] Sunday 30-7-16 Attached to the Battalion 2 Platoon A Co. took up work today on a small tramway.  Another experience of Shrapnel fire.  There being at least a dozen casualties within 100 yds of our job but that is nothing here.  It did not look nice to see them carried away on Stretchers with Blood soaked clothing.  Had a swim today.  Tried to get a drink in Albert but could'nt.  One chap hit in the arse with a piece of spent Shrapnel. piece nearly red hot
