<p>16/6/18<br/>Querrieu<br/>A very pleasant spot here except for a wretched Hun gun which drops big shells around. Two English officers were killed in the village tonight. After mess in the direction of Villers Brettoneux the Hun downed in flames one of our observation balloons and its poor occupants went to hell. Rode right round the companies which out in open paddocks are living in trenches and yarned to them all. This was a fairly long ride and it was dark when I got back. We got 500 francs worth of beer up for the boys tonight. Camped at BnHQ in the grounds of a fine Chateau the air balmy. Were it not for this cursed War the life would be idyllic. Tonight from here we could see the spire of Amiens cathedral looking out over these downs as it has done for 800 years. What a loss to the world if the fine old place is hit</p>
