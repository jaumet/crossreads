to see a show called a Trip to Paris. It was absolutely awful.
Tuesday. 15.10.18Left Edinburgh at 9.5am & arrived at Glasgow at 10.10am. Went to central Hotel but slipped & had to wander round & look for another place. Finished up at the George Hotel. Went to lunch at The Grosvenor & dinner at the Central. Met major Donaldson at the Central. Went to the Alhambra Theatre & saw Pamela. It was fair. Voices were very poor tho.
Wednesday. 16.10.18Dr Speirs came around soon after we got out of bed. We all went out shopping & at 12.15 I went to meet Harriett Winter at Copeland & Lye. We missed one another, so we boys went to lunch. After lunch we went back to the hotel & I sent away all my Xmas cards. Harriett called round to see me & we had a real good old talk.
