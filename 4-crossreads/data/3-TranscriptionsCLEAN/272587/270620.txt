Here also conditions are being improved & tunnelling being pushed on with.  Shelling was very severe here this evening but two men killed & one wounded was the extent of his damage. Dec 7th  Move back to East Flers again.  Very little to do as there are practically no wounded.  Weather dull & visibility very low.  Baupume tower has fallen but the chimney stack is still in tact.

Again the 1st is unlucky   At Bulls Trench a shell burst on the D.S. door & wounded our officer  Capt Hughes (new to the unit) & one of C. Section bearers.  The doc is likely to die of his wounds.  At Longueval.  Barr was wounded while driving & had his horse killed.  The day has been fine & Fritzs shooting very effective as a result.  He tore our trainline up at two places but it has since been repaired. Dec 12th  Very cold last night & this morning the ground is covered with snow a heavy fall. Dec 13th  Still dull.  Last night the 5th Batt took German strong point without any opposition.  The same as from which the 1st was repulsed on Nov 5th.  A good number of wounded came in.  Capt Hughes has died of his wounds. Dec 14th  Move back to A.D.S. at Longueval through Delville Wood Dec 15th  Fatigue work at A.D.S. where mud is worse than at the line.
