<p>27/7/18<br/>London<br/>leaving their seats and going out for a smoke, lounging in the corridor with the men. An English captain picked up a very charming befurred piece of French mischief. Returned tired to hotel at 5 pm. After a rest tubed up to Blackfriars and walked down to the old Cheshire Cheese for an excellent dinner at a reasonable rate. Then to Piccadilly and up to the Regents Palace for some coffee but the place was too crowded to get in. Tubed back to Victoria &ndash; the streets all crowded here around with sailors and soldiers. Nearly every second person wears a uniform of some sort. Back to the Grosvenor Hotel and did some reading and some writing there.</p>
