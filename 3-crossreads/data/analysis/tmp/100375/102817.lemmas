 A veri heavi gun is be fire about 10.30 each even It has a tremend vibrat It sound like the kind of gun which Fritz use when he was bombard Bailleul befor he made his attack and enter the town . There is much differ of opinion as to whether this is a Fritz gun or our gun which is fire . It is veri hard to tell but it may be one of our long distanc gun . To-day we met two soldier stand with fix bayonet at the entranc to the villag . This look as if there is go to be someth do again I have taken particular notic of the French troop that have march past here and my opinion has been greali enhanc by the appear of these men . They are not the puni men we have alway been led to believ that they are . They are a fine sturdi race of men and no wonder Fritz has found a formid foe in them . A thing that amaz me is the fact that in spite of the cloud which is hang over their head , that Fritz may break through again , the peopl work away in their garden and look after their home as if noth is like to happen . Their home garden and field of grain may be devast at ani moment yet they go on in their work
