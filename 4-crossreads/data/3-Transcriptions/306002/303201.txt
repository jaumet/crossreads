<p>22.6.15<br/>Tue. 22nd.  The shells that were falling amongst the 3rd L.H. yesterday proved to be 9 inch shells, it is marvellous that no one was hurt.  I believe the English &amp; French have taken a large part of Achi-Babi Hill, heavy fighting was maintained down there during the whole of last night, &amp; the artillery has been very constant this morning.  The Turks have been dropping shells onto Popes Hill (just above us) again this morning.  I was on a sapping party from 4 till 8 this morning putting through a small tunnel.  Stan &amp; Smithers were on from midday till 4 p.m.  The aeroplane came along observing at dinner time &amp; had the usual shrapnel fired at her but none of them went near her.  Matheson sent along a box of paper &amp; envelopes for B troop, but we did not receive any as we have nothing to do with any troop now but draw rations etc. with</p>
