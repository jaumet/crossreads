  
 14.10.15 Thurs 14th I believe the Canteen at Imbros was not warned that so many order were likely to come in  & the amount of goods we sent for were not available; We have to find a guard at present to protect what was available & is now on the beach, it arrived yesterday afternoon; Nelson came on the scene this afternoon fit for duty & took over, I have not to go on duty tonight letting things go just as they were; Stan has been complaining right along that he is not well but I have never felt fitter; I have been right off my tucker the last few days but feel as fit as a fiddle nevertheless The Hospital boats are constantly on the go between here & Alexandria.
