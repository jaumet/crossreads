 Dear Judge, Thankyou very much for sending me the extract from Keith's letter, the extract in itself I think should be comforting to you as showing that Keith is on the road to recovery, his humour showing him to be his same old self. I enclose a copy of a letter recently received from Bertie which makes reference to Keith, and in other respects may be of interest. 
 With regards, 
 Yours faithfully, [indecipherable] Mr. Justice Ferguson, Judges' Chambers, Supreme Court, SYDNEY.
