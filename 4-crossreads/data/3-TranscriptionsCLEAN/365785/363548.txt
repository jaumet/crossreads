Court has turned it down & we don't know what they intend to do with him now.  I suppose he will be sent somewhere for a short time but Major McKenzie told me the men had to get fit as quickly as possible & get back to duty.  We have two new Majors - Major McKenzie - who however has left the Unit and is now on the Staff of the D.M.S. - & Major Bond, also Basil Kennedy sports a crown.  Captain Stott is more insufferable than ever and those stars are painfully in evidence.We had a reunion at Gezirah on Sat. night, Officers, Nurses, V.A.Ds & men of the Unit, dinner was laid in old No. 1 Ward for 350 which was decorated with flags & greenery and with all the uniforms looked very pretty indeed.  They took a flash light photo which has turned out splendidly.  I expect it will probably appear in the S. Mail later.  I went down with some ladies - Mrs. Connors & Miss Hindmarsh - to Tel El Kebir one Sunday.  We took our lunch & a lot of their friends met us, among them, your brother Fred, it was so nice to see him
