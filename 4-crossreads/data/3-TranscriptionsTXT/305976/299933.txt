 Friday Nov 9 Today we were sent out foraging for tucker for ourselves &amp; horses. We are down to Biscuits only. S.M. went over to railway to try &amp; get in touch with Headquarters. Wally Evans &amp; I found a redoubt and on going inside we fell over a wire. We thought it was all up &amp; fully believed it was mined. However nothing happened and after clearing some of the Turks out we came across a fine lot of grain. We found a few live Turks hiding here. Turks in small parties were wandering about wanting to be captured as they had no food.
