<p>to see Sister Nicholson &amp; Watt. Oh, Nickie came out to see me Monday-night. They both are looking so well. It is a lovely place &amp; an ideal spot but a fearful way from the city    &amp; very hard to get to. Sister Watt was on duty, so only had a few minutes conversation with her.<br/>Saw also Col. Ramsay Webb (our G.C. on the Kyarra) he is looking very thin, had only arrived here a week before us. Sure this climate will do him a lot of good.<br/>Had a lovely &amp; happy time with dear old Nickie but had to leave soon after five &ndash; got to London in time to meet some more of our sisters &amp; we all went to "His Majesty's" Theatre to see "Chu Chin Chow." It was beautiful, just two little parts we did not approve of but oh, to hear a decent play again, was grand. Oscar Ashe &amp; Lily Brayton &amp; some very good musical artists. I am sending the programme</p>
