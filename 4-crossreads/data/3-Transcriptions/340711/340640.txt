<p>Sunday, 9.<br/>Reveille 8 a.m. Afternoon off. Went up to the town---met Les White.</p>
<p>Monday, 10.<br/>Orders out to leave midnight. All blankets and surplus material to be handed in. Had to split up my little medicine chest. All I have now is my haversack (cram full), water-bottle, gas helmet, respirator, mess tin, bandolier, (full of matches) belt, and greatcoat (full of books). I cannot get another thing in my tunic pockets. Orders out not to leave tonight, but tomorrow night. Nearly all the men boozed. Sgt. W. and others under arrest, the former close arrest. Drunkeness.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 11.<br/>News has come through that our Wagon Line at Neuve Eglise was shelled and smashed up the day after we left. Exercising horses. In afternoon took two sick horses down to the town (Sylvestre) to be cast. The Maire fixed me up. Went back and got Certificat des D&eacute;g&acirc;ts. Left Sylvestre at 7 p.m. We went a rather round-about way, just skipping Hazebroucque, and linking up with the main road again. In addition to the usual lumber I wore my respirator---in all about 50 lbs. No bon. We rode all night---nothing to eat---halted but rarely.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 12.<br/>Arrived at St. Omer 4 a.m. We were all dog-tired. We just tethered our horses to anything we could find, letting the teams stand, and then, near the railway station, beneath a great grey sentinel, a magnificent cathedral in ruins, we lay out on the footpath, officers and men, and slept for an hour. Left St. Omer by train 8 a.m. after entrainment of horses etc. I was Corporal of the Guard. We had very little sleep on the journey. Arrived at Amiens about 4.30 p.m. Then, (no tea) mounted and moved off to Belloy-sur-Somme. Arrived about 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Thursday, 13.<br/>We are in Picardie. There is a different patois here. The people are very dark, and many very beautiful. We are 16 kilometres from Amiens.</p>
