<p>we had.  Next day, we went back to Russells Top, after a stay of five weeks and two days here, and relieved the 28th Battalion, who a fortnight previously had relieved the 26th Battalion.  On our arrival, the Turks bombarded heavily and the big guns from the "Goeben" the German warship, assisted.  The "Goeben" threw about a 11 inch shell, filled with high explosive which exploded with a terrible roar, playing havoc with our trenches and dugouts.  Our casualties were numerous and three more officers (one an artillery officer) were put out of action.  My dugout was safe from the 75s, only and I spent some anxious moments, when the big shells came grumbling over and burst close scattering dirt, etc.</p>
<p>Preparations for the evacuation had been going on for some time, big guns, mules, rifles, etc. were being shipped, so as to leave nothing for Johnny Turk and all the jars of rum were broken on the beach.  Provisions were being given away so we fared well.  Plenty of condensed milk, strawberry jam, fancy biscuits, tinned pineapple etc., and we got porridge for breakfast.  All the clothing that could not be taken away was soaked in petrol and ultimately burnt.</p>
<p>I went down to the beach one day to see the wharfs that had been built to facilate the embarkation.  A large steamer named the "Milos" had been sunk off the piers, so as to act as a breakwater against the heavy current.  Everything was ready and shells were being taken on the motor lighters.  Whilst there, "Beachy Bill", started firing, landing shell after shell on the stern of the "Milos".  The stores etc. were fired, so evidently the Turks took credit for it and the blaze could be seen for miles.</p>
