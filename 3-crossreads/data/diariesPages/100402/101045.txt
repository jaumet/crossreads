Saturday 23 March
On fatigue work building dugouts at Spoil bank, on the Ypres-Comines canal. Everything very quiet, except that Fritz shelled St. Eloi. Glorious spring day. Rumours still rife as to German offensive. No reliable information.
Sunday 24 March
Beautiful day.
The Ludinoff Offensive has developed rumour has it that he has advanced to a depth of two to fourteen miles into the Somme area attacking from Arras to La Fere, against the English French. Apparently some Australians are going down to-day we are preparing to take over more front to the right of our last sector, relieving the 5th Div. We moved to a place on the Wycheate-Kemmel road to-morrow we go up to the line on our new sector just to North of Messines.
