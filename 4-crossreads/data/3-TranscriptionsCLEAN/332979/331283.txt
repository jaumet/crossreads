  
 Ammunition in the Magazine. They face the Sea & must not take their Eyes off it. If they see any Suspicious Objects  they  or Lights in the near distance they must Fire one round & point in the direction & Shout out to the Corporal of the Guard. If it is a long way off they let the Corporal know who reports same to the Officer on the Bridge. On the Starboard Side there are 6 positions. The Corporals duty is to place the Men & Inspect them every 1/2 hour to see if they are keeping a sharp look our as we are well in the Danger Zone & no chances are taken. The Ship also has a Man posted right at the Front of the Forecastle Head also in the Crow's Nest.
