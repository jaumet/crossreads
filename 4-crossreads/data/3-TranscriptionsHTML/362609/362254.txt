<p>About 7 o'clock we reached our moorings along one of the stone-flagged quays where a military guard was waiting. The townsfolk took little notice of our arrival having so many transports arriving recently from overseas and as afterwards became evident, having had many thousands of Australians pass through their town.<br/>After breakfast came a wait for the Military Landing Officer all packing being completed in the meantime.
