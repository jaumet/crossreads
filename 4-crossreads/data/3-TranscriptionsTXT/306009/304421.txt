 1915 Aug. 25 Wed. To-day is observed as a Holiday by the Egyptians on which the "cutting of the Khalig" takes place. The annual festival is meant to keep in the minds of the people the value of the Nile &amp; its yearly rising. In the old days there used to be a dam across the river &amp; when the flood was high enough "the cutting of the Khalig" was celebrated &amp; the dam was cut. In addition a young girl used to be thrown in the Nile as a sacrifice but for the past  30 centuries  this latter practice has been discontinued &amp; an image of mud substituted. A great feast also takes place &amp; there are firing of guns, decorated river boats, crowds of natives, etc.
