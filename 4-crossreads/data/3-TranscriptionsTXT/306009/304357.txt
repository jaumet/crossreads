1915June 20 Sun.A big school at Giza (Saidieh School) has been converted into a Red Cross Military Hospital & is being run by civil voluntary aid. I had a look over the Hospital this afternoon.Suddenly received 100 fresh patients to-night - First for a fortnight - our hopes of getting away from Egypt dashed to the ground - Hurrah! They are only to stay for the night & to-morrow - Now even more hope of getting away from the land of the Pharoahs.
