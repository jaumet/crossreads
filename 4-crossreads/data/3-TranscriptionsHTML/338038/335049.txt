<p>9<br/>Well, dear Parents, I will have to cut this letter off as the mail boat is expected alongside any moment now.<br/>I expect this letter will be delayed here for a fortnight or so in which case it should reach you just about Christmas. How I would love to be home just for that day, but I will be thinking of you and now wish you &amp; Pat a very merry Xmas &amp; all happiness and prosperity for the coming year.<br/>Fondest love from<br/>Your affectate son<br/>Terence.</p>
