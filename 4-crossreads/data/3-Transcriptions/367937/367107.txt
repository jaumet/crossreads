<p>well and have made a wonderful recovery.<br/>Aunt Katie and I are just going into town and Aunt Katie is going to hold my hand at the photographers.<br/>I saw Mrs Meares and Sibbie on Mudgee railway station they were at the gates when the train passed and I waved to them so they came up and talked to me.<br/>My Eileen was not there though.  After I had my tea I was up at the end of the station talking to Mr Marks and when the whistle blew for the train to start I ran to get in my carriage only to find the rotton door was locked.<br/>I grabbed a porter but his key would not fit the lock it was miss my carriage or get in through the window which I did (my word was tight).<br/>This is at the P.O.  Hope you all got home safely.   Love to F &amp; kind regards to Mass<br/>Your loving son<br/>Rob</p>
