 Dear Alan, or Tommykin. You would have enjoyed being with me while on my journey, only it would have made you so dreadfully tired. A mile is rather a long way, & I have travelled every day 20 or 30 miles, & sometimes more than 50. But of course I have to keep on every night until I reach a place where I can get a bed & some tea, because if I slept out in the bush it would give me a bad cold. 
 The children in the schools always like to see me, because there are so few visitors. Many children have to walk a long distance to get to school - I saw one little boy & girl who had to go 2 1/2 miles each way over a rough mountain, but of course their mother gave them
