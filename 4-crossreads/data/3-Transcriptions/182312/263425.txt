<p>drill.&nbsp; As soon as we come out of the trenches we start &quot;right</p>
<p>turn by numbers&quot;, and &quot;form fours&quot; and all this sort of</p>
<p>elementary stuff.&nbsp; It seems absurd but there is nothing like it</p>
<p>to smarten the men up after their cramped life in the trenches.</p>
<p>This is really a very smart Battalion and after they have been</p>
<p>out of the trenches about two days and have had a chance to</p>
<p>smarten up they drill better than any Australian soldiers I have</p>
<p>seen drilling in Australia.&nbsp; This from men who have been at</p>
<p>trench warefare for about 12 months - Gallipoli and here - is very</p>
<p>good.&nbsp; Our Church Parade (I couldn&#39;t get out of it) last Sunday</p>
<p>was a particularly fine turn out and was held under a big chestnut</p>
<p>tree.&nbsp; Every officer and man was there and it was the first time</p>
<p>I had seen the Battalion all together.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t help thinking</p>
<p>that the Huns would have had a big bag had they put a couple of</p>
<p>shells into us.&nbsp; Fortunately none of the planes were about at</p>
<p>the time or we might have got strafed - it does not take the</p>
<p>planes long to put their artillery on to a target.&nbsp; Better than</p>
<p>planes for general artillery observation are these Kite bal<sub>^</sub><sup>l</sup>oons</p>
<p>commonly known as &quot;sausages&quot; owing to their likeness to this</p>
<p>favourite article of German diet.&nbsp; Both sides use them and each</p>
<p>side tries to destroy each others bal<sub>^</sub><sup>l</sup>oons by aeroplanes dropping</p>
<p>incendiary bombs on them.&nbsp; Only last week I saw our aeroplane</p>
<p>destroy three of Fritz&#39;s sausages.&nbsp; It was about seven or</p>
<p>eight o&#39;clock in the evening that he sent up four bal<sub>^</sub><sup>l</sup>oons</p>
<p>evidently intending to do a bit of shelling in the twilight with</p>
<p>the aid of the observers in the baskets attached to the bal<sub>^</sub><sup>l</sup>oons.</p>
<p>They had not been up a quarter of an hour before our planes were</p>
<p>over and destroyed three out of the four - they just managed to</p>
<p>haul the other one down in time.&nbsp; We had a very good view of the</p>
