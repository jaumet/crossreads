<p>been discarded. However as walking was not to be thought of, as endangering the life of the other man, the Sentry refused to crawl but proceeded on his hands &amp; knees &amp; had a pretty bad time of it, the Sergeant to keep up had to get on his hands &amp; knees too.</p>
<p>Starting out on this venture everything was very quiet, orders were given in whispers &amp; the men in the line looked just like dark "shades" occasionally moving a step or two to take a better look across "the open". The ground was white with snow &amp;  being all pitted with shell holes, most of them with water which was frozen over, therefore care had to be taken not to slip into one &amp;  possibly break the ice, the cracking of which on a calm night would have sounded quite plainly in both trenches.</p>
<p>Progress had not been made very far, when from the Hun trench a brilliant rocket or "flare" ascended in the air, &amp; unluckily enough appeared to be directed right at the spot where the Sergt &amp; Sentry had been moving. As these "flares" turn night into day, no matter what position or attitude one is in at the moment one bursts into brilliancy not a muscle must be moved, for the least movement of any kind is then plainly visible, &amp; goodness knows how many pairs of eyes may be on the watch.</p>
<p>In not more than ten minutes no less than seventeen flares were sent up by the enemy but the men were careful only to move when darkness reigned.</p>
<p>Out in "No mans land" between both lines of trenches with two known Machine Gun positions in the Hun line not more than forty or fifty yards distant, with everything very quiet, a peculiar uncanny eerie feeling pervaded one &amp; with every flare a heavy burst of Machine Gun fire was, each time, expected, but when none eventuated a calmer feeling prevailed till at last a sort of reckless "dont care a hang" mood came over one &amp; good progress was made, the cold on the ground or in the air did not at this time trouble any of the men in the "open"</p>
