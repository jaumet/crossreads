The Armenians numbered about 35 & looked very serviceable & smart in their real Scout kit - they are really good on parade. The Italians were dressed in their Bersaglieri uniform. Everything went off very harmoniously. First occasion on which 2 Scout organisations in Cairo have met. Met Ben Champion at 6 p.m. & we had a walk round the town. A1 to get some Wahroonga news.
