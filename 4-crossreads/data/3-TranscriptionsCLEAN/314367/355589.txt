  
 Part I H.M.A.S. Fantome The High Seas Monday 7-12-14. 
 Dear girl We did our gunnery & steam trials & put back to Garden Island - I got a letter from you & Mab & R - Mab got her buttons & R told of his Fort - I am sending R one of my 3 tailed bandages in case of casualties - It may come in handy. Anyway he can learn to bandage from its pretty pictures - I had no time to reply for we put to sea & shant touch land till we get to Cairns - As soon as we got out - General quarters were announced - gun crews were listed & each man - including myself - had his billet assigned - just as if we were going into action - at once - I have to stand by the Ward room & attend there to all the wounded - The Ship's corporal & the Sick bay attendant have to cater for me & pick up the wounded & bring them to me - My S.B.A. has already asked me if he cd be put ashore but I candidly told him I wouldn't lose him for worlds & that if he wasn't shot I'd make a man of him before the trip ended - He's a combine of Fool - Coward & Ass I think - Gun crews have to sleep by their guns - Shells are handy & everything is arrayed for instant action - in fact - the sole aim of our life is to be efficient - for action - & everything is subordinated to that point of view - Gun drill - Fire drill - Boat drill -
