 Night at Matrooh . The littl mosqu across the ink blue bay Gleam in the moon , an alabast toy : Like golden firefli the mors lamp play Where line on line the pallid tent deploy The Moonlight 's finger linger on the sheen Of silent plane , like giant gnat asleep A Cross of blood abov a bar of green The Ship of Pain steal out across the Deep. Matrooh , Jack Sommer
