Bob and I went into Ismailia today and had a good dinner at Hotel des Voyageurs We had to tell the guard that we were going in for medical stores to get through. We had a very acceptable swim in the public baths in the afternoon and afternoon tea at some Church Canteen run by English ladies. It was a treat to talk to an English women again. Had to be back by 7 p.m. to dress Major Caddy’s arm.

Very busy sick parade this morning Went for a swim in Lake Timsah this afternoon. All the New Zealanders are moving off to France from here lately only a few left. The few left their mark by burning all canteens to the ground tonight It started by the proprietor of a wet canteen doubling the price of his beer. He thought he could ask anything as they were leaving, but they had swift retaliation drinking all the beer first and then burning the Canteen. Of course all other canteens

had to go once they were started. I dare say a good many Australians were mixed up in it too. Nearly all these occurrences take place under some provocation. The N.Z’s left their Camps in filthy condition. I must say all Australian lines are left scrupulously clean when leaving and our sanitary arrangements are always perfect. I have an A.M.C. Cpl to take my place if I can arrange to get into a battery. More canteens are being burnt tonight.

I saw Major Cuddy today about getting into a Battery and he promised to let me in as a gunner if the A.D.M.S. will approve. Today a man came on sick parade complaining of pains in the back, and got pack drill. At lunch time he reported to me that he had done pack drill all the morning and had to do so again this afternoon - He was running a slight temp so I informed the Dr. and got a note exempting him. I gave it into his orderly room and his Lieut. told me that he had only done this pack drill in the morn & and wasn’t going to do any more in the afternoon after my running round for him for an hour
