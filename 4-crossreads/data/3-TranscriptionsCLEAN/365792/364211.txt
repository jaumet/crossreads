  
 May 8 beds, but still dry & fairly warm. Have got 2 blankets & my greatcoat  Struck 2 other Australians at the Ref' Bar, had tea & cake & then strolled off down town. We are allowed off from 4.30 to 8.30 but must be here in the tent by 9. 10 of us in here including Canadians, Africans, English & Australians, & they're a fairly decent crowd. Boulogne itself is rather pretty especially round about the Cathedral & Park where the fine old elms are showing their spring leaves. We went down per tram (there are some stiff gradients too) but walked back - a distance of about 2 miles. Struck it lucky at the Canadian pay office & got 25 Francs, so am now financial: - (40F)  Some of our chaps are booked for Aust, but I believe a glass-eyed Tommy was sent back to the Trenches. Hours are as follows - Reveille 5.30, brek 6 am [in margin] Marlboro' Camp
