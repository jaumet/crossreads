<p>Sunday 30th December<br/>   In the morning went for a walk round Oxford st. Strand &amp; Trafalgar Square returning per bus, it was good to see the old place again.   Saw C.P. off just before lunch;  he going to Birmingham.   I then went &amp; had lunch at the Australian Y.M.C.A. at the Aldwych Theatre;  a splendid affair.    There I had what they called a Standard meal for 1/3, Soup, meat &amp; two vegs;  pudding &amp; coffee.   Splendid value.   Then caught train to Dartford about 15 miles out of London where I saw friend Ramsay now with two dots up.   Also changed into my good Uniform which I had there.   Had a look round the place &amp; had tea at the Sgts Mess, all very grand, billiard table, bar etc, &amp; met several old friends of Lemnos days.   Returned with Ramsay to London with the idea of going to a show but there was nothing on, so went out to his cousins at Kensington instead.   Turned in well satisfied with myself.</p>
