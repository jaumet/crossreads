  
 of the Army Medical Corp.  We went into camp on the 18th Aug '14 at Broadmeadows in mufti and were informed that we were to undergo about 1 months training. I was one of an advanced party a day ahead of the others at the camp and we had to erect tents etc.  For the first fortnight we were chopped & changed about in a very indefinite manner.  Our uniforms gradually arrived and our little corp of 58 men began to look a little smarter our work & drill was mostly dismounted troop drill and stretcher & first aid dressing we also had a daily lecture from one of our officers.  Our Col, Tate Sutherland and our other officers Capt Nicholas & Fowler are very popular with the men.
