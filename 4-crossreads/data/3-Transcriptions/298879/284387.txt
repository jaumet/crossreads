<p>June 1915<br/>Monday 7<br/>Fine    Our platoon having a rest ahem!? We had to do all sorts of fatigues. I was mess orderly for the platoon &amp; Orderly Room Orderly at the same time. Went back into fire trench in the evening. We always knock off work to carry bricks. I wrote one letter.</p>
<p>Tuesday 8<br/>Fine. Our chaps attacked the Turks trenches on the left again and held them until 3 AM next day when they evacuated them. The attack was made to draw a large number of Turkish Rein. who were going to strengthen the right flank. Sergt Bramhall and two men went out on patrol and returned safely</p>
