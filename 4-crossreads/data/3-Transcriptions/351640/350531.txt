<p>above named Britishers do the whole of the work. I entertained Dr. Wilmot to dinner at The Union Club at 8 p.m., the hour for dining here.</p>
<p>I enclose you a set of surcharged postage stamps, Indian, place them with the others, they will grow in value, the 1 rupee one especially.  I got them from the post office at the San Stefano hospital.</p>
<p>We expect to be leaving here tomorrow.  I send on also a newspaper, which is published daily at Cairo and is distributed here.</p>
<p>The weather in this place is ideal.  It appears that 8 in of rain falls per annum in Alexandria &amp; none in Cairo.  At Bourke in N. S. Wales the fall equals 9 in. per. ann.</p>
<p>My next letter will be from Cairo.  The first part of this letter was written to amuse you.</p>
<p>The Military people here must look upon us as a lot of silly tourists.  Officers, who should be monished go out with walking sticks, no gloves, cameras on backs, &amp; such nonsense.  It grieves one sadly.  However there is no attempt at discipline, there never has been.  Suppose it cannot be helped.</p>
<p>Goodbye now my dears.  May the best of Fortune's gifts be with you now &amp; always.  Heaps of good wishes to my friends. Especially to Maria &amp; the Watt family.</p>
<p>Love in loads &amp; kisses in abundance to Car, Joseph, &amp; Kitty from<br/>their loving and affect Faree<br/>John B. Nash.</p>
<p>P.S.  What language do the resident doctors talk here?  English, Arabic, French, Italian, German, Maltese &amp; others.  What think you of that?  J.B.N.</p>
