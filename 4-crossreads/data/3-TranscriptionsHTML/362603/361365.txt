<p>2.  but they are not so nice.  I have had 2 oranges, 2 apples   &amp;   3 bananas since I landed in England, so I do not get so much now as I had in Egypt.  The oranges   &amp;   mandarines that we bought in Egypt were the best I've ever eaten I think.  Mostly grown in Cyprus   &amp;   Syria but a few grown in Egypt.  I would sooner be in Egypt by far than England.  As one Australian said "I would give it to the Germans,   &amp;   apologise for such a rotten gift."  It is blowing a gale   &amp;   we have had sleet all day to day.  It is just awful.  I am on Night Duty now.  Ellis will <u>not</u> have to go on.  I have done one week.  I never slept for the first 5 days or nights, but now I sneak off to bed at 3 am   &amp;   sleep generally till about 9.30 am.  I was just beginning to knock up when I worked this latter scheme out.  I have a bonzer meal at 10.30 pm to 11pm, A Roast,   &amp;   Baked spuds, Toast,   &amp;   pudding   &amp;   a cup of good Tea.  We have the Tea made in Buckets at Mess   &amp;   it is unfit for Human Consumption.  It is the worst muck that I have ever been called on to drink.  One of our Boys met Norm Lyons in Salisbury last night.  I must write to Him   &amp;   try   &amp;   get Him to come over for the day.  I went out for a walk in the rain with Dave yesterday.  We walked to a Village about 3 miles away.  It rained most of the time but that is not considered here.  I had left off my Calico drawers as they were dirty,   &amp;   my new Breeches that I was wearing chafed my legs pretty badly.  I have bought some sateen to make some more drawers, but I cannot get a bit of paper to cut a pattern</p>
