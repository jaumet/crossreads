 11/1/16 Up at 0630 lovely morning a fog lying over the cultivated land the desert set hard with the heavy dew. The battalion paraded on physical drill at 0700 and I started with the NCOs class again. Next parade 0930 marched in mass with fixed bayonets &ndash; good work. Then out to site of old trenches. Drilling on a battlefield. The trenches well sited and commanding but the ground very full of folds in some of which a whole battalion could muster. In fact although within a few hundred yards of each other the companies were at times quite isolated. 
 Took horse out in afternoon, a black hack, and she went well. A very sharp white thorny bush grows which the horse seems to like but as one gentleman remarked it would give his the quivers. Acquired a vestpocket Kodak later in the day. Too busy in office altogether. 
 12/1/16 Artillery formation with NCO's first thing stayed off second parade preparing Courtmartial papers &amp;c. Half holiday in afternoon, read up back papers and letters and went for short gallop but Tommy Robert's horse got away with. Letter from Jack and also a number of Australian letters too. Requisitioned for pay and arranged other routine. Still some tents short but Pedler is sending along mess stuff. In the evening attended at Bde and we are to proceed to the Canal to take up a defensive position there. Since coming here I have become desperately lousy again and am itchy from head to foot. My horse is lousy too. The itch is intolerable at times. Imshied sick man off to hospital, didn't mind him in orderly room but objected to vomit &amp;c. Imshi eggere!
