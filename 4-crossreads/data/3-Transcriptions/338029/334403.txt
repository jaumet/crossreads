<p>tedious journey at 12.30 p.m.</p>
<p>Wednesday 5th<br/>Same old Cairo, busy all day rushing about, went to A.D.M.S. to enquire about my neglected furlough, he smiled and opening a draw showed me a confidential report. Sergt. Morris genuine case &ndash; to go 15th inst.  I was so delighted that I walked out of the building dazed,  I had to rush round and tell O'Raff's all about it, there delight was mine.  God Forbid that any thing should happen now.  I turned the s.s. job down but hate to think of the regt. going into action without me in it.</p>
<p>Thursday 6th<br/>Chasing all over city looking for A.P.M. to extend my leave, wired the regt., reply granted then met the smiling old Doc., also on leave.  I congrated him on his majority and he my on my trip, but we will both leave the regt. together.  Spent pleasant day but pavement tires one out, took O'Roff. family to dance at British Club, slept Anzac Hostel, returning first train in the morning.  I cannot yet realise I am going to home sweet home.</p>
