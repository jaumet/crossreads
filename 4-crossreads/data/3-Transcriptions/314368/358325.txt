Nevertheless the people have a fine spirit and done all they could for us. They were all confident in the end of the war and were very pleased with the progress our troops were now making. While we were at one station a couple of trainloads of German prisoners went by, they all looked big burly men . Our chaps are doing great work now in France I believe although the Australians are getting it pretty hot and are having heavy casualties. We are likely to be in England for at least 8 weeks now. Of  England I can tell you little as yet. I have seen some of the antiquities though, that is the old druids temple  at Stonehenge ,  (Ida might remember it) only a stone throw from here. Our whole battalion has got 4 days leave to go to London will be able to send along all news of the old country next week. We are all going up to London on Monday next.  This is just a hurried scribble to let you know how things are going dad, will write longer later . Trusting all at home all quite well and assuring you that I am myself  in good health,  With fondest love to all<br/>Your loving Son</p>
