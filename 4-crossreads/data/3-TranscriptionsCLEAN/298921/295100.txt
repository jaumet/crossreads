May, 1915Friday 7Still very sore at being left - I had actually stored my kit & made every arrangement, now the Regiment is broken up & the Light Horse Brigade also & the Division too - men are wanted badly; but I cannot give details or this would never reach you.You ask re Adjutant's work, it is the mouth-piece of the Colonel, either Lt or Capt can do it generally Lieutenant in peace Capt in War. One does not get much promotion when left behind.
