<p>40<br/>Called &amp; saw my little girl by the babbling brook &amp; received quite a welcome. It rained the day prior to leaving Senlis rendering the roads in parts practically impassable. It is raining now my water-proof cape is just it.</p>
<p>19/8/16<br/>Still raining &amp; it looks like setting in. Felt pretty weary last night after 25 miles ride &amp; slept like a top.</p>
<p>24/8/16.<br/>Went for a lovely spin in the Napier last night to Senlis it was great. Called at our old billet in Rubempre coming back &amp; had a wine. The Driver (J Lean) let her out coming home from there, gee, she did travel. Boiled the billy had a good cup of tea &amp; turned in.</p>
