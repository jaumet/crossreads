  
 much put out over it, no bon she says. of course at that time the Somme was a rather warm quarter. however I am getting ahead of my story, enough of the Somme later. 
 The most excitement we had while on the Fleurbaix sector was on the 19th July 1916 when the greater part of our division hopped over, as a raiding party, the idea being to prevent Fritz from withdrawing troops from here to reinforce lower down on the Somme. It was about this time that our lads took the "Pozieres" ridge & we lost heavily in that stunt as you perhaps remember, & did no visible good, in that of giving the boche a part nightmare.
