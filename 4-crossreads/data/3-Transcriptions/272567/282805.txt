<p>2/12/18 Monte Carlo - Nice<br/>Monte Carlo right on the spot. The dresses of some of the ladies were daring. Reached Nice at 11.30 and was driven to the Hotel du Luxembourg which is a poor place badly furnished. Decided to have all my meals out. Put in a considerable portion of the day lounging in the sun on the Promenade des Anglais with occasional excursions up the streets. Put in an interesting trip round the Galeries Lafayette hoping to buy a piece of Mons ribbon. The shop was crowded. Darkness comes up at 4. At 6 I went down to the Hotel Ruhl &amp; Anglais which is very select and expensive &ndash; a gay crowd here. Dinner very elaborate cost 21 fr. including the tip. Afterwards took a walk and met the tiniest of little Parisiennes out for a walk. Did not reach hotel until 11.30 &amp; soon fell to sleep tired out.</p>
