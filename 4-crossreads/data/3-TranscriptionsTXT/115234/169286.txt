since we were in "Bayonet" trench at "Flers" last year.  Got home to the Dugout dog-tired & my pal. "Dutchy" had a big fire blazing & some prime "Coffee Au Lait" simmering thereon:
13th  Went & saw the quack this morning.  One of the shells had dropped on my big toe & squashed it considerable.  No Duty for me tonight. So for once Fritz will not have me for a target.
