<p>Australian Hdqrs<br/>Cairo<br/>11.5.19.</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>Very many thanks for sending me a copy of the evidence etc in that case against the Terraces Hospital. I was much interested in it and of course feel that the finding was very hard on the nurses.</p>
<p>I know what it feels like to have a patient collapse &ndash; you dont consider anything in the world except how to restore respiration and until breathing is going on alright you give no thought or attention to anything else. I am quite certain that had I been in the Sisters place precisely the same would have happened.</p>
<p>I dont like to think how many times even in my short experience a patient has got wet in bed or on the table and I have never thought twice about the chance of any ill result &ndash; merely changing the bedding when every other thing had been attended to. And I think if anyone had come messing around while I was doing artificial respiration on such an errand as to see whether the patient was getting damp &ndash; I would perhaps have overstepped the bounds of polite conversation.</p>
<p>There still seems to be some unrest in Cairo</p>
