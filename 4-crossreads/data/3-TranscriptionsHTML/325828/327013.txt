<p>occasion I had seen it like this, and really, Daddy it wasn't a fit morning to turn a dog out.  However I duly arrived at Perham Downs, here, which are part of Salisbury Plains.  A bleaker or more desolate place would be harder to find.  The whole place which is undulating country is one big Military Camp &amp; crowded with long grayish coloured huts.  We have 30 men in our hut &amp; are fairly comfortable.  The main thing is that the huts are raised well off the ground &amp; are quite water proof.  They <strike>have</strike> issued 4 blankets last night which are quite "chatty," &amp; I had a wretched night last night, being the first night on hard boards for over two months, &amp; what with my tiny bed-mates I didn't get too much sleep.<br/>This morning the Plains were one mass of snow as far as they eye could see &amp; the wind sailing over these is anything but pleasant.  It is a dreary, desolate sort of place at any time but in the winter it is absolutely over the fence.  This morning with some 60 others we had our Medical Classification with the result that I have been classed "B2 A4"  This means, as far as I can find out about 2 months in England on some sort of light duties.</p>
