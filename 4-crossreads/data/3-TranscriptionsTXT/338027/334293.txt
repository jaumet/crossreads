 Tuesday, 29th December, 1914 Orderly room call went at 8.45 a.m. &amp; we were paraded before the colonels tent, the corp was charged first &amp; after hearing his evidence he was remanded for courtmartial.  We all got severely reprimanded by the C.O. and got seven days C.B.  my first default since I enlisted. 
 I let my pony be ridden by an N.C.O. to-day, who is a bit rough on horses but I wanted the freshness taken out of him &amp; I am not allowed to do it.  Every half hour after Retreat the trumpet sounds Default &amp; we have to run like Hell on to the parade ground to be dismissed this continues until lights out. 
 Wednesday, 30th December, 1914 Court martial continued this morning we all gave evidence on oath finally he was severely reprimanded, we all thought that he would lose his stripes. 
 Pay day but still I draw nothing having not yet worked off my debt I had my pay book altered so will be all right next day.  At night wrote to George.  On day stables all day with the other 3 defaulters. 
 Lately the corp has not been working very smoothly, the officers of both sections have been quarreling &amp; the men are very dissatisfied.
