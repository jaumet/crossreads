<p>[This is page 50 without cabaret ticket]<br/>39<br/>there is any excitement to remain in town. Guns are fired near Champ de Mars but so far few people are stirring so we attend concert in Theatre in Champs Elysee a beautifully furnished place with a roof of hidden light which illuminated the frescoes &amp; the building but which was itself invisible.</p>
<p>After performance we visited Boulevards. Crowds have now arrived but beyond trying to [indecipherable] or forming a chain across the street &amp; enveloping people &amp; then romping round them in a circle there is little excitement. We enter caf&eacute; Grand &amp; beyond a little larger &amp; noisier crowd it is the same.</p>
<p>We descend to Taverne Olympia &amp; there matters are livelier. Everyone dances with anyone &amp; place is a revel of victory nest &amp; return to Boulevards. Processions are formed &amp; in one place road has been torn up &amp; every vehicle stopping owing to difficulty is attacked by crowds. Further along dancing is common.</p>
<p>Altogether considering the French temperament it is a mild display but perhaps the long time since cessation of hostilities has somewhat damped enthousiasm or perhaps I shall see more on the night when peace is signed ie Tuesday, Thursday &amp; later on it is fixed for Friday.</p>
<p>I leave Duke</p>
