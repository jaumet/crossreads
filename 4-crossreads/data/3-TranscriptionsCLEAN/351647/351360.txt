(such nice handy paper do look at the lines)
a great kid.  Fascinating I think & I loved his remark to you [indecipherable] red stockings after his your long homily.  So cute, he knows a lot for his age.  I thought of that chaste song we used to have on the first phonograph, you remember in "You're the one" what the nurse said when she brushed his curls.
I think its dead mean of the Murrumbidgee to go & rise so well when I'm away.  To think of Gum Creek running & me not there & I'm sure when I'm back she won't ever run again, not till I take my quadrennial (peu tetre) trip to Paris.  The point races & dance sounded funny, I hope you enjoyed them.
Glad you liked the Kirchner pictures, I'm looking forward to seeing them again.
I shrieked at Carl V. coming up, you howdacious woman.  My word it is time I came.
I suppose I'll pay for that remark later.  Well so be it, I'll put up with a lot if I get back.
We are putting in a much better time now, its great to be out & in nice restful country, clear running streams & green grass & untortured trees, no mud & horrible rotten country & its nice to know (even if it is selfish) that our crowd are for the present comparitively safe,
