17/11/18 Yzeux
A bitter cold raw dull day and Sunday. At 10.30 there was a conference at DHQ of Brigadiers CRA and all the heads. The subject of discussion was the advance to the Rhine and we are to be ready to move in 2 days time to Le Cateau first of all and then subsequently by route march over 100 miles to the Belgian German frontier. The entry into Germany is to be a triumphant and imposing one and we are to have flags flying and bands playing as we go along. Worded up the General for a little wad of leave and hope to get it & to find the Bde in Germany when I get back. Spent the afternoon over the fire at Bde H.Q.and had Col. Duggan to dinner in the evening. Called a conference at Unit Comdrs at 10.30 am in the morning at the Chateau of Tirancourt. Early dark and bitterly cold night.
