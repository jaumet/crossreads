 Fine &amp; cool. I was orderly 
 officer for the aft of the ship. Its 
 not a bad job though as the 
 duties are light. Had a 
 boxing tournament in the 
 afternoon &amp; it was very good. 
 Also had arough dance at 
 night, but as there were only 
 about nine ladies it was 
 not much of a success.
