a lighthouse (showing three flashes).  Wednesday weather dull & threatening, we had a marching order parade this morning.  Thursday weather fine but hot, we were paid this morning, steamers pass fairly often now, this last three days, Friday we are in sight of land on both sides now, having passed Mt Sinia this morning, weather perfect.

Monday weather hot, we were given bread and jam, biscuits & tea (not much either) for breakfast, some of us were detailed to get blankets from the station 1 mile away, about 25 of us to each big hand cart, we had stew for dinner, bread & tea (not much of it) in the afternoon we were innoculated against Choleria, then the mail was given out & I was lucky in getting one, there was great excitement over the mail then we were issued with blankets (two) we went for a walk then went to bed.  Tuesday 9th breakfast bacon bread & tea (not much) weather still warm though the nights are very cool.  Wednesday we were picked to go to the front, but owing to our not being properly equipped we were
