<p>ground for inspection by Col. Tunbridge (all units).  A long route march follows of about two miles &amp; we all receive instructions in using our gas helmets &amp; tear shell goggles.  (Received mine to-day.)  As usual I have the job of taking back my section, of whom I know not one.  Dinner &amp; a rainy afternoon.  Censoring letters until 6 p.m. &amp; tea.  Sergeants' Mess meeting until 8 p.m. &amp; then to my tent.  A cold &amp; miserable rainy night.  Camp under these conditions is no good.  Meet several old pals to-day:-  Sgt. David from A.I.F. Hdqrs., now on 1st Anzac, Ray Ruhan from Town Hall, Will [?] McDonald</p>
