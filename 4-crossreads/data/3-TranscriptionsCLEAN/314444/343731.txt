 Dearest Mother & Father, A few lines to let you know I am feeling tip top, in fact never felt better. I hope you are all very well at home. We are having plenty of rain, which makes the going a little uneven. Still we carry on very well and the supply system is wonderful;. You would not believe the work could be done so well, the boys work with a great heart. I expect you feel a bit upset about the Russians but dont worry, as the right boys will not move back. If it takes ten years we will "lick "em". I don't know what the Russians are afraid of, they have a good amount of Artillery but when you get up to them they are full of course that is too late with the right boys. Have not seen any of the boys from the Bay lately. My weight is just over fourteen stone and as hard as a rock, and good as ten square heads, any day. I hope you recieved the photos Miss Astin posted you. Remember me to all friends, Hoping you are all well, Best wishes & love, Your loving Son Tom
