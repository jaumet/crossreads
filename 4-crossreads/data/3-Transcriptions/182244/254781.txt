<p>Anecdote</p>
<p>An officer lay between the Australian and Turkish lines wounded.</p>
<p>Two Australians saw him from a trench and discussed which of them should go into the fire swept zone im endeavour to bring the wounded one to safety.</p>
<p>The toss of a coin determined the choice.</p>
<p>He who called head crawled stealthily to the prone officer. Pulling him by the coat sleve he said. &quot;Get on my back Sir&nbsp;&amp; I shall endeavour to carry you to the trench&nbsp;&amp; safety&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;My good man six bullets have passed into me or through me all-ready.</p>
