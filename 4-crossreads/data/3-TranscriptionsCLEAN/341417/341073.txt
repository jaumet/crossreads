  
 writer, for I sooner do a hard days work, so you will have to excuse me for not writing more often. Before I do finish I shall have to wish the Firm "A Merry Xmas & a Prosperous New Year". I dont suppose you will be very busy there, as they are all very slack here. So I shall have to conclude now, thanking you once again 
 I Remain Your Obedient Servant Pte W. Rowley 
 P.S. Excuse writing, as there is no ink in the firm. 
 Remember me to all the rest of the Firm, also their wives and families. 
 A Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year.
