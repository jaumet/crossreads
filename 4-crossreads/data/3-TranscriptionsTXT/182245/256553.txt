7 WEDNESDAY
Fine &amp; Sunny, &amp; fairly warm. The
snow started to thaw a bit to
day &amp; about time too. I was on
stableman all day &amp; had a
good day on my harness &amp;
got it all in A1 order. The
whole battery was called out
&amp; had to take amunition to
the pits at night. We only
sent up 4 horse teams so
I did not have to go, thank
the Lord.
