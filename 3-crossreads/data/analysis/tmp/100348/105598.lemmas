 was great shake of hand amongst us for we have been through Hell . Both Gener Walker and Birdwood came to see us . Birdwood congratul us on the work we did ; he say that a British regular divis that was on our right said they were "proud to fight besid us " ; we did give the hun a nasti jolt in wrest such a strong key posit from him . I wash my face and hand , the first time for a Week 28/7/16 . Start away again this even and march 10 mile . The transport took our pack but mani of the fellow were too weak to march and ambul pick them up . I do n't wonder now whi a man need to be high train to stand up to this job . It tri me out this time for my feet are veri sore .
