  
 The Melbourne Express Sund. Sept 27 1914 
 Dear Aunt Amy, I wanted to get across & see you before I left today - but I only had two days altogether to get ready in & the rush at the last was too heavy. I hope to get back to Sydney again, and if I do, of course yours will be the first visit that I shall make - If I don't manage it, give my love to Joan & to Nancy & to Old Claude, and accept lots of it for yourself. I hope the arrangement at the little house will continue - it is such a very happy one. You'll look in & see Mother wont you - Goodbye - in case I dont see you to say it. I hope I'll see your Jack over there. Write (or get mother to write) & tell me the regiment he's going with. Charlie
