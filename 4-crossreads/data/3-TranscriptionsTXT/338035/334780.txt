a thing never happens as with noise etc. we never get to sleep before 10.30 or 11 p.m. and am awakened before 6 a.m. by swabbers etc.Pat Day injured his knee rather badly today by falling on deck and at night I bathed it for about an hour in hot water.Band learning some new selections and "The Manhattan Beach March" and "Moonlight Bay" are well known at present in Sydney.  Also "Fox Trot" from "So Long Letty".  Received news of fall of Czeroveith [Czernovitz or Czernowitz] and capture of large number of Austrian Prisoners.Have traversed 1483 miles since leaving Capetown up to noon today and 11000 miles odd from Sydney to date.Obtained some information from a patient from Orderly Room (Sergt. Major Hopkins) relative to ship transport of troops.  He informs me that the shipping Company obtains 500 per day and in addition 1/6 per day for food for men, 3/3 for Sergeants & 6/- for officers each.  A canteen is run by a ship's steward (privately) who sells beer which cost him 3/- doz. at 12/- doz. thereby making 9/- clear profit on every doz. sold.He also charges 4d. per glass for lime juice which was down on list as a free issue to troops.Cigarettes.  He charged 1/6 per tin and we could obtain a similar quantity of same brand for 10d.
