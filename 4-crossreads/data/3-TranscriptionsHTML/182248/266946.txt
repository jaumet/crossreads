<p>and teased him till he was mad as a march hare. The conversation as far as I can remember it was something like this:</p>
<p>Dragoman:- &quot;You like Scarab?&quot;</p>
<p>Unsophisticated Australian:- &quot;No Scab here, all good unionists.&quot;</p>

<p>U.A.: &quot;Finish, my bonnie brown eyede liar, <u>but no business</u>&nbsp;this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Would you believe it the old fool went away muttering angrily in his&nbsp;beard. He wanted me to give him 3 good golden quid for a little stone like a petrified beetle. Perhaps it was genuine, perhaps not. If genuine it was probably worth whatever a fool Curio Collector would give, perhaps 30/-. But it might have been a fake. The Gyppies are wonderfully clever at faking antiquities and curios. In the Museum at Cairo are genuine thousand year-old relics from the tombs and pyramids. But the Gyppies copy them and sell the replicas as genuine. When I was leaving the museum a dragoman sneaked up to me and in a most mysterious way thrust an antiquated statuette into my hand and whispered hoarsely: &quot;5 shillings&quot; He wanted me to think it genuine and, I bluffed a treat; I examined it with the concentrated gaze of a connoisseur&nbsp;Egyptologist, scratched it with my knife&nbsp;and then exclaimed &quot;Bah, rubbish, 1 piastro.&quot; The old sinner eagerly cried &quot;Yes yes: and held out his hand for the money. So I got a fraud which when you see it you will readily believe to be genuine. He went away quite/</p>
