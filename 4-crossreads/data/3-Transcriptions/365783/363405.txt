<p>I was pleased to hear that you had been taking a few motor trips &ndash; there are dozens of cars running between Cairo &amp; the camp but I don't like them.   The drivers are a terrible wild reckless lot of men &amp; I don't feel at all comfortable with them at the wheel.   The fare into Cairo is 50 piastres (10/-) &ndash; the soldiers generally club together &amp; get in by car for from 1/- to 2/- each.   I always prefer the first class compartment of the tram 1 piastre (2 &frac12; d.) though sometimes I travel with the niggers for &frac12; piastre.   I think the double page picture in the Graphic that you refer to is a general view of the whole camp here &amp; was taken before we arrived on the scene.   I saw in the "Australian" an account of the Pockley Surgood wedding.  It took place at St Paul's Wahroonga on 22nd Jany. &ndash; apparently only relatives present.<br/>I hope you received the small parcel I sent you about a week ago pair of stockings etc.   With very best love to all the dear ones<br/>Yr. loving husband<br/>Will.</p>
