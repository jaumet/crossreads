 Duboitz Ri duly sworn states 
 The photo marked A is a photograph of Maetzelts body, taken after the Men had been stabed with the bayonet.  Matzelt came to me, at the same time, as the two Men, who had been lashed with the Cat o Ninetails.  The photos was taken &frac14; to &frac12; an hour after the incident had happened.  The spreading dark marks over the body are staines of Blood.  The two marks wich looks like holes in the perforation of the skin are bayonets trusts.  Their wher more bayonets stabes than those.  It would be able possible by means of a photographie to exaggerate such marks as these shown:  but no attempt of this description has been made by me.  The men came to me: the photo was taken just as the wound appeared upon the body without alteration.  I also produce a smal photograph brought to me by Sergeant Riegner to develop, wich represents the small detention Camp.  This photo is a fair representation of what the prisoners of that number looked like, when they wher in the compound.
