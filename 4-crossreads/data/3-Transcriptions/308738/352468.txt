<p>June 26 Saturday 1915<br/>Still feeling dicky. Smooth sea lovely passage sighted Alexandra 3 PM anchored at Warf  - 8PM.<br/>Col Ryan on board sick was removed immediately, remainder stayed aboard.<br/> Some of the prominent names given to different Hills, &amp; point of advantage at Gaba Tepe or Anzac Cove.<br/>Walkers Ridge, Popes Hill,Dead Mans Ridge, The Bloody Angle, Quinns Post, Courtneys Post, McLaurin Hill,Scotts Point, Johnsons Jolley, Boltons Hill &amp; Point Rosenthal</p>
<p>One of the main features of the troops being so near the Beach, is the "Bathing"from early morning till late at night, there is a continual procession of men covered in dirt &amp; sand going &amp; returning from their daily wash. From Colonel to Trooper  the one desire is to get a dip in the briny, &amp; though the shrapnel falls around the bathers &amp; though some of their number are stricken down whilst in the water, the same determined spirit prevails. The men must keep themselves  as clean as possible, &amp; risks must be taken to accomplish this necessary task.</p>
