<p>[Image only partly transcribed. Part of it shows a typewritten copy of an earlier letter dated 14th December 1918. The latter part of the image shows a date of 22nd Dec 1919 which should possibly be 22nd Dec 1918 in which case it might be a continuation of the earlier letter a few days later. More investigation is required to sort this out.]</p>
