<p>to Dr. my complaint but he ridiculed my opinion.  He puts me in mind of an ex-jockey.  I told him my trouble was intestinal &amp; he laughed, &amp; wanted to know how I knew such a thing.  Why ask my opinion, when I was evacuated from Gallipoli with jaundice &amp; lumbago.  At Luna Park they would do nothing for lumbago &amp; sent me on here for sulphur baths &amp; massage.  Finish sulphur baths etc.  <strike>Wrote Mabel another long letter &amp; sent her P.C.s (one each) of the hospital &amp; the Baths.</strike></p>
<p>The food here is excellent, also the accommodation &ndash; its an ideal place to recuperate, the climate is dry &amp; the nights are warm, though heavy fogs visit us early morn, but these are soon dispelled by the rising sun.</p>
