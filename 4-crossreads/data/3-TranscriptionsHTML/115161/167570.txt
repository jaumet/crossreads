<p>looking, modest and with clear skins and beautiful complexions, all as nature endowed them. How different from the&nbsp;average town girl, with her face &quot;done up&quot; with powder and cosmetics, her eyebrows pencilled and her general &quot;get up&quot; anything but attractive. How foolish they are to spoil and hide the (in many cases) healthy and lovely complexions given them by nature. What empty-headed wives they make as compared with the healthy, athletic and genuine country girl. I suppose the town girl imagines that she attracts the opposite sex, well I suppose she does in some cases, but not men, only things dressed as men. The real man is attracted by a genuine girl who wears the complexion and hair yes! and figure too, as supplied by nature. Why can&#39;t the town girls be natural and not &quot;doll&quot; themselves up in such absurd and idiotic fashion. The men-folk are sober and industrious.

<p>In these picturesque villages there is usually one or perhaps two public-houses (inns they call them) bearing titles as &quot;The Red Bull Inn&quot;, &quot;The Dun Cow&quot;, &quot;The Stag&#39;s Horn&quot; and many such like. The name appearing on a swinging sign over the door, with usually a picture representing the title. Inside the Inn everything is wonderfully neat and clean. No stale smell of beer and tobacco, glasses polished, stone floors so clean that you could eat your meals off them. You get the best spirits or other form of drink you require. Nothing flash, just plain and good, served up well. The meals are in keeping with the rest of the establishment. You are not &quot;had&quot;, no! in these places you get a straight-out honest deal.</p>
<p>Drunkenness is almost unknown. The liquor served out is good and the villagers are not pigs, they do not drink for the sake of drinking. They just meet and have a glass together and then to their homes, they love their homes, these&nbsp;people. The publican does not entice them to drink, he does not expect them to, he does not like to see anyone the worse for liquor.</p>
<p>Yes! dear old England is not the cities and towns, but the glorious country&nbsp;and villages, those&nbsp;are England, and there is the backbone</p>
