of about 2 kilometres to Hospital, and on arrival we were given a basin of vegetable soup & afterwards washed & put in bed.

The water that I was washed in had been used for about 20 men before me, it was absolutely filthy & no doubt I made it much worse for I was very dirty myself. The following day I had all my particulars taken as regards name, Regiment & etc.

I also had my hair cropped short & I was shaved all over the body, then moved to another Hut & into bed again.

My wound has been very sore, and they have not washed it or treated it in anyway excepting they put a clean paper bandage on it.

Up till Sunday the 22nd I have had my wound dressed again twice. On Thursday & again to-day , one Russian Prisoner died, through bad treatment & starvation. On Friday I wrote my whereabouts home to Alma & to Uncle. The next day the 23rd another Russian & a Scotchman died.
