<p>a fine view of the church.</p>
<p>On the wall is a notice saying that &pound;100 was contributed towards seating the church providing 196 seats were reserved for people belonging to the parish. Figheldean is the prettiest village I have seen.</p>
<p>The houses have all thatched roofs with large overhanging eaves.</p>
<p>On coming back we got lost on the downs but the air was so pleasant and bracing and the scenery so restful that we did not mind our 10 mile walk before we got back to camp.</p>
