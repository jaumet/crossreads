<p>Opera Companies which come here during the season and which comprise</p>
<p>some of the best known singers.&nbsp; The Prince&#39;s main idea seems to be to</p>
<p>get the people here,and he is willing to waive profits on such things as</p>
<p>Operas, Golf Links, etc to do it, relying on the Casino and hotel and</p>
<p>shop rents to reimburse him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an impression in Australia that the Riviera is</p>
<p>a very expensive place to live xxx in, but from what I have seen of the</p>
<p>place, it is much cheaper than Australia and very much cheaper than London</p>
<p>Assuming that one does not&nbsp; want to go to the hotels frequented by</p>
<p>millionaires and the Royalties of Europe, there are any quantity of good</p>
<p>hotels where very rreasonable accomodation may be obtained.&nbsp; Several of</p>
<p>the officers from this Home have brought their wives over from England</p>
<p>for a holiday and they are staying at some of the best hotels in Mentone</p>
<p>for which they pay 12 francs (9/-) per day inclusive xxxxxx tariff, and</p>
<p>for this amount they can get the pick of the rooms.&nbsp; I have had meals in xxx</p>
<p>these hotels and they are quite equal to anything in Australia and of</p>
<p>course the climate is the pick of Europe in the winter.&nbsp; The prices for</p>
<p>these hotels may have been a bit higher in pre-war days but there are so</p>
<p>many hotels and Pensions that one could be sure of comfort at reasonable</p>
<p>cost.&nbsp; We can hire a high powered motor car holding five for the whole</p>
<p>day during which we will do up to 150 miles up and down mountains and</p>
<p>the cost will be 150 f. (&pound;5/10/-).&nbsp; Tips are very reasonable: even a</p>
<p>head waiter will fall on your neck for about tuppence.</p>
