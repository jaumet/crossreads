 Shopped & pd. up Bills of Dollys & danced in Hotel in evening. Fox trots & only 2 one steps & 1 Waltz. I'm not much good at the first - a splendid band & good floor & Dolly is a perfect little dancer, & looks so pretty & such a youngster, you would not think she was married. Raining & snow. We get plenty of Tucker but one has to pay 100 % more for everything & I could not keep up this pace.
