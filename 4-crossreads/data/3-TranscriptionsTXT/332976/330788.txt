January 191729th   I went for a ride in a motor this afternoon along the Amiens road as far as Ribemont.  The snow is still frozen on the ground & the weather is exceedingly cold, with a bighting cold wind blowing.At about 10 p.m. a couple of German aeroplanes flew over Albert & dropped 8 bombs.  They swept the place with machine guns & then flew over towards Becaudle [Becordel] & dropped four more bombs.Later in the night he sent over some of his big shells not very far from our hospital.31st   We have had another fall of snow to-day.  I have been given a job on the hospital staff, looking after the messing arrangements, while in convalescence.
