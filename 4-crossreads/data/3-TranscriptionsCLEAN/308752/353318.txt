Friday 25th February.All rush & excitement this morning, we are actually moving off at last. After a great amount of muddling (which is common to the military) we are in the train ready to move off to Tel-el-Kebir at 4 p.m. Needless to say every body is very pleased to leave Serapeum, which was indeed a dead & alive hole. Two days rations issued, bully beef & biscuits. Very interesting train trip, the natives rushed the train, trying to sell their wares at every station, it is very funny to watch them. Arrived at Tel-el-Kebir at 8.p.m. This is the biggest camp we have been in yet, troops everywhere, I believe there are 25000 quartered here. Now have to start unloading train, working till long after midnight. On arriving at our camping ground, I was unfortunate to strike guard duty, & instead of having a good sleep after our strenuous day, I was obliged to walk up & down my beat until daylight, if I had sat down I would have fallen asleep, & there is a severe penalty for those who fall asleep while on their beat, as you know. It is all in the game, so there is no use grumbling.
