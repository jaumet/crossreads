My dear Father
I was very pleased to get yours and Mother's letters of the 1st August as the last I got from home was dated 17th July - What a long time my letters seem to have taken to get home; I don't think I will use those green envelopes any more as they seem to take so much longer: Your letters this time were not long coming to me. I got one a couple of days ago from Mardie dated 7th August in which she gave me a description of their celebration of the Anaversary of the start of the war - Guess I wont forget that morning of the 4th for a good long time.You ought to have got a good many letters from me by now as I wrote pretty often from Rasel-tin.Tomorrow morning I am going down to Port Said for 48 hours leave so hope to be able to see Mr Trelawny Mr Wilson's brother-in-law.There is no news here at all and anyhow I must get my clothes ready for tomorrow so cant write much.Was sorry to hear of Nigger's death but I think the poor old fellow has done his share at home; I hope none of the other horses have got that complaint.Please thank Mother for her letter and Oliver's address in it; the parcel she is sending sounds
