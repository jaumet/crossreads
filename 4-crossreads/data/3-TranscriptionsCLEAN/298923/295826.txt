9 June 1918 SundayJust fired at a Snake with revolver but of course missed him they live in the cracks of the Rocks.  Mosquitoes very bad here-   I have a dirty old nett am glad to say-The stillness here 1000s feet below the sea, is like waiting for a thunderstorm that never comes-  Bag of snakes today included a puff headed adder- fatal in about 8 minutes, all Jackos carry Snakebite antidote but we have none yet.Camels bring us Water rations at night time & we show no lights or movements-
