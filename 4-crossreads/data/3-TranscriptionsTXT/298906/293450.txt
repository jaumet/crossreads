25th. Nice & sunny today a change after yesterday, we are on the last week of our Instruction now time flies alright.26th. Curran came home absolutely helpless last night, he was carried & dragged back by Woodward who was very little better himself, they both had been drinking heavily all day, it's a wonder how they managed to keep out of trouble, Curran is a terrible fool with money, a couple of days ago he drew a good sum, & gave me a fair bit to hold for him so as he would not spend it all at once, I can't imagine anyone like that, not having a will of his own. We have been on Field Engineering all the morning & it is a very interesting subject.
