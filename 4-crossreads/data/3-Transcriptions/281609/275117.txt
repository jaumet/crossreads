<p>22nd Beautiful day. Harness cleaning all day. About 7 pm Fritz sent over about 8 high explosives which dropped in a field nearby tearing up the ground and sending men &amp; horses scattering in all directions. All night long he kept it up firing in about ten minute intervals.<br/>23rd (My birthday) Warm. Nothing doing except ordinary daily routine. Heavy bombardment at night. Raining.<br/>24th Dull. A &amp; B Coys with transport leave for Avoca Gully (near La Boiselle). Roads were good &amp; we reached the gully without mishap.

Unhitched &amp; after having a cup of tea returned to transport camp at Senlis arriving about 6 pm.<br/>25th Dull &amp; wet. Nothing doing all day.
