<p>but am quite happy except of course that I am yearning to get home again. However there is no use yearning it must end some time &amp; then I shall just blow in to tea some Sunday night &amp; tell you all about it. I am afraid we shall all be most frightfully boring when we get back and become reminiscent.</p>
<p>Best love to Dorothy &amp; everybody else.</p>
<p>Best luck to Keith</p>
<p>Yours affectionately</p>
