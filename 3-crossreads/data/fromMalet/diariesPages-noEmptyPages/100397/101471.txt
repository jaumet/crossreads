Tell Father to thank H H for her enquiries and convey my Best wishes for Xmas New Year to the Lady, I am not too sure where I met her, but think in town = Lys.
I would not mind going over again if some of the Hd Qr. Crowd had a better idea of the Rules of fair play, I am sorry to say their Ideas are all one-sided. they appeal to the men to trust them but they show the men in every way possible that they do not trust the men themselves, they would not grant the men who went away on Saturday any embarkation leave, after the first move was cancelled, a sort of half promise was given, that an effort would be made to grant leave, then they were told that in all Probability 48 hours leave would be granted, that helped to steady some of the men, but the next thing we heard was that they would moving off that same night had I been on that draft I would have set out for London right away and had a few days holiday whether they liked it or not. they simply encourage the men to take French leave. but enough of the military, we have been having what an Englishman here told me was real Nov.ber weather, it's a good job it was the real article and not an Imitation, the coastal weather at home cannot compare with this, here it just knows how to rain, in a dreary, monotonous sort of way that keeps the Place nice and wet. we have good hard roads through the camp, so do not get covered in mud. That is one blessing, the last couple of days have not been too bad, in fact it was a rather nice day today no Rain
