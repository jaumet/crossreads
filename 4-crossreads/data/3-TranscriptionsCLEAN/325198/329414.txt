16 Dec, 1916BayoudYesterday morning at 3.0 clock we were turned out & saddled up, at least A & B troops did & at four oclock we moved off East, we went out about 13 miles to Zagadan & waited there until three in the after noon until the Camel corps who were making a raid on a Bedioun camp had signalled "All clear".   I rode "Paddy" who is not doing much work & spelled Dick who got over the rope & [skinned?] his heels.  Some more reinforcements came in yesterday & A troop got two.  Last year this night I was getting ready to emshie from Anzac.  Ill not forget that night.  The work loading the barge & wondering all the while why "Beechy" [Turkish gun] didnt try to find us
