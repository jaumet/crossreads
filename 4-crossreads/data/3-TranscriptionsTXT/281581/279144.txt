 Proceeded to sea ere we were up with improved weather and dead calm. Unescorted, for safety we steamed in close along the shores and had a fine prospect of the beautiful Southern Coast. Delightful little beaches, sandwiched in between cliffs, with here and there stretches of sloping upland country, heavily cultivated and looking like various colored carpeting. Then there were stern cliffs bedecked with purple heather and sheer white chalk faces that resembled the great ice barrier. Many beautiful homes nestled in cosy corners surrounded by heavily foliaged trees and such lawns -  verdant and velvety- as only England can boast of.
