 January 1918 Tuesday 15 
 At Beutin Usually daily routine . Weather fine. Played 53rd Bty a game of Rugby during afternoon result draw 5-5 I went along to Etaples with Dick then to Paris Plage. The latter is in Peace Time a pleasure resort and is indeed a pretty little place. There are quite a number of W.A.A.C.s camped at the former place. Etaples is a peace time big fishing centre, and possesses a very large square, not to mention an electric tram service to Paris Plage.
