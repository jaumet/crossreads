had their business fully explained. We are moving in a few days apparently to St Omer but after that our destination is obscure.
Oct. 14 Move this afternoon to Steenvorde, a town within French border, 8 miles from Poperinghe.
Oct. 15 Leave Steenvorde at 11 am marched about 12 miles to Villet about 5 miles north of St Omer. En route we skirted Mont des Cats Cassel from which a view of over 400 Towns villages is to be had. Coast of England can be seen on clear days. The country is beautiful hopfields giving way to pastures fine trees. Cassel is a fashionable health resort. More I see of France the more I am enraptured with it. Berries now galore, blackberries raspberries currants.

Oct. 17th At nordasques. P. de C. 20 miles from Calais. Visit Ardres the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Record my first vote on Conscription issue.
Oct. 18th Still at Nordasques. Visit adjacent village of Turnehiem through which runs a light railway Calais, St Omer, Boulogne. Villages very quaint, water mills being very much in evidence.
