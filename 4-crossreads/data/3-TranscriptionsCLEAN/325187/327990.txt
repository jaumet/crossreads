[Monday 4 September 1916]
Cold better one poor boy died last night, just one day from home!Sun very sickly, & looks like rain in France.Expect to get to Southampton tomorrow at 4 pm & unload tomorrow night.I have asked to be sent to a London Hospital, & so I finish with Egypt for a while- & when the years have rolled on the Oasis boys may remember the Australians who made glad the hearts of the donkey boys, made sore their (the donkeys) backs sometimes & taught them some of the choicest swear words in the English languageMy future wanderings will be of interest to you little Mother alone till I start once more on the great adventure.
