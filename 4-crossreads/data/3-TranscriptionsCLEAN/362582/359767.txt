  
 P.S. Did I tell you that Norman Bower wrote to me from Alexandria, said he was coming to Cairo for 3 weeks & would like to see me, so I wrote & told him to come to hospital, where he would find me. He sent his love to Aunt Belle, & to cousin Belle, Ethel & Alice. He wrote such a nice little letter. Had just got one from his mother, saying I was here. Poor old Keith wrote me a short note just on leaving camp & asked me to tell his mother they were all well & in good spirits. Must stop now. Fondest love & kisses Edith
