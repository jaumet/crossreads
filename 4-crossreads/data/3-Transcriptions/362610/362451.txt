<p>Wednesday 23 August 1916<br/>Again very warm. On the go at odd jobs during the morning &amp; after lunch had to report to the 2nd. Bn. for General Birdwood's parade. It was held in a heavily grassed meadow, the whole of the 1st Bde. attending, being drawn up in a hollow square, in the centre of which the "victims" were placed. In the absence of the 1st Bn. I was the first to be called up, General Birdwood shaking hands &amp; saying several nice things as he handed each one the ribbon of the medal won. Afterwards he made a short speech extolling the exploits of the Austns. The parade over, I rode out on bike to Vignacourt, having tea there &amp; returning to La Vicogne by dark. Forgot to say that during the day I met Dr. (Major) Goldsmith who used to attend us at Chatswood.</p>
