large Y.M.C.A. there & returned home by lorry.
July 20.   Drill again in morning.   At 10 P.M. we were awakened and the Brigade went out for a s on a stunt across the fields.   After a bit of night-manoeuvring we returned at 1.15, and had a cup of tea before turning into bed again.
July 21.   No drill;  Sleep in to make up for the work last night.   I was a bit tired, having acted as scout for our officer during the stunt.
At 8 P.M. I was one of a trench picquet.   This duty was an easy snap.
July 22.   Picquet all day.   At night we went to a good concert given by the local "Tommy" transport (?) corps.
July 23.   On Picquet till 8.30 P.M.
July 24.   drill per usual.
July 25.   Wet day, therefore no drill.
