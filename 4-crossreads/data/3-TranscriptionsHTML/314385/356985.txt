<p>1916</p>
<p>Wednes Sep 27th<br/>This day was eventual.</p>
<p>At 8.15 a.m. we were paraded in full review order as we are to be reviewed by Gen Birdwood who arrived punctually at 9 in his car. After reviewing &amp; addressing us he decorated 3 of our boys with the Military Medal. Who should come with him but Andy Fisher the X Premier who stood there like a dummy &amp; spoke not a word.</p>
<p>The General reminded us that we would have many trench feet to deal with. After the address he visited the wards then departed.</p>
<p>This evening there was an interesting &amp; exciting 20 minutes. An observation baloon broke loos and after drifting in the sky some [indecipherable] towards the enemy lines. We not being able to recover it. Some of our planes came on the scene &amp; hovered over it just like birds &amp; almost before we wondered what they were going to do a tongue of flame shot up out of the baloon</p>
