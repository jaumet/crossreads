<p>1918 June<br/>time been made highly efficient and we had cause to be thankful for them two months later. There were a lot of French soldiers about here. They were holding a sector somewhere to the south of us. They used to sell us "vin rouge" which is issued to them as a drink as tea is to us. We (the sigs and runners) had made our possie just big enough for ourselves. One day Sgt Major McKinnon told us that his young brother Don was going to join us. We received him with mingled pleasure and regret. Pleasure because we thought that the S.M. might treat us better and regret because he made things a very tight squeeze in the possie. Bill Collins was on the porky side and had a bad habit of rolling in his sleep. It was a case of "When Bill turns we all turn". However, apart from Don's arrival I think the S.M's feelings had changed a bit towards us, as it was mainly with Ogle &ndash; our Corporal that his antipathy lay. Whatever it was however there was no doubt that we received better treatment henceforth. Capt Thompson</p>
