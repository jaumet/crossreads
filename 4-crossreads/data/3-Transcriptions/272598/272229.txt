<p>Saturday 1.9.17<br/>Very quiet, nothing very sensational has happened to create excitement.</p>
<p>Sunday 2.9.17<br/>Spent the day in St Omer. Change from the ordinary routine of camp life.  Band usually plays in Park of a Sunday, where crowds of both civilians &amp; soldiers congregate.  Fortunately left the town early enough to miss an air raid by Fritz, dropped a good number of bombs doing considerable damage</p>
<p>Monday 3.9.17<br/>Fritz again came over &amp; bombed St Omer, also tried to bomb [indecipherable] but was driven off.</p>
<p>Tuesday 4.9.17<br/>Route march of about 8 miles</p>
