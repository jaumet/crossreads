<p>The Croft<br/>[indecipherable]<br/>Lindfield</p>
<p>Dear Old Dod &ndash;<br/>How are you, you must be well the very opposite to me.</p>
<p>I got a letter from you this morning. I have a swolen gland as well as weak eyes. For any close work like reading and wrighting I have to ware glasses as I [indecipherable] gogles. I had drops in my eyes at first.</p>
<p>Every body is well here. The last few days in bed has been rotten because I could not read.</p>
<p>I must now say good-bye</p>
<p>Good luck<br/>Alan</p>
