  
 4 [indecipherable] Hospital 22 December Wednesday  6 Hear we are off to Egypt in a day or two to join our Horses - as you see below over 10 bags Mail here - came so 2 Australians came from Mother - Letters from Percy Smith May - Walter Campbell - Embarked at 2 p.m. on the Ioman for Egypt - wet muddy & tired but with a feeling of thankfulness at being alive - now if we can dodge the submarines we are right, for a while. The Boat is crammed with troops  X & unfortunately there is a good deal of feeling between the English & Colonial officers - certainly we have many Scrubbers, but among the Tommy officers are many snobs and nincompopes - the real man is easily picked out. Sounds small etc.
