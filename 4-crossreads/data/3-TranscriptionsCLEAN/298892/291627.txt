receive this letter and I wish you all a very happy Xmas. I would have liked to get you and father some little thing just as a token of the times but I could not hit on anything suitable.I did think of getting my photo taken in London as I knew that would please you should it turn out well but the time to return to camp was up before I discovered a decent photographer. I sent Kit a little brooch which I hope she will like. It rather took my fancy although the colours are somewhat sombre.I suppose you will have Douglas home and he will brighten things up considerably. The house must seem rather lonely with only Kit at home. I trust father is keeping well and has not had any further attacks.Give Aunt Kate and Uncle Vesey my best wishes for a happy Xmas and prosperous New Year. Also remember me to Tare and Peg and I trust they will declare a peace for Xmas & New Year's Day.Your loving SonEugene.
