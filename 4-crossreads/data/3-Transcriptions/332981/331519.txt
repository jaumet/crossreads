<p>Let our thanks also be given to those who have toiled incessantly at home, to the women no less than the men, in producing munitions of War, and to those who have rendered essential war service in many other ways. Unwanted privations have been cheerfully borne and the hearts of those who were facing the stress of battle have been cheered by the steadfast confidence with which those whom they had left at home awaited the issue and assured them of their unflattering devotion to the prosecution of the War.</p>
<p>While we find in the things cause for joy and pride, our hearts go out in sorrowful sympathy to the parents, wives and children who have lost those who were the light and stay of their lives.</p>
