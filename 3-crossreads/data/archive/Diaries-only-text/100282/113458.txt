would be half way home to dear old "Aussy" a chap wounded or sick would stand a good chance of getting back
20th. D. Coy had a bit of hard luck in one way with their patrol last night they took 2 of Fritzs pillboxes cleaned out the occupants, in trying to do the same to a third ran foul of a machine gun which wounded killed practically the whole party, one or two got clear one of them ran into Lens Machine gun post early this morning, he had got lost in the confusion in some remarkable manner had got past our wire Fritzs "outposts" so back into the support line fully a 1000 yds behind the line, up to this morning they had got 3 of the wounded in, but there are still an officer 3 or 4 more out there somewhere. I expect they will find them tonight. 
We got a clean change of clothes this morning the first change we have had since the 22nd December we wanted it for the chats were eating us
