<p>My dear Judge,</p>
<p>Sunday morning, church parade is on and the band is playing, I can't go being on duty but it is some company</p>
<p>I am sorry to have missed seeing Keith when in London, I arranged an afternoon to go to the Hospital but was detained at the A.I.F. Kit Store and was too late. However my sister went to see him &amp; tells me he is quite bright and almost quite well. I also heard yesterday, from Captain Clunes Ross that he is out of hospital now: the latter goes back to France in a couple of days, I have not yet received orders, I shall not be sorry when they do come, it is very monotonous here, I have been here nine days now.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your letter, I often talk to Caesar about you, he was quite well when I left him on April 2nd .</p>
