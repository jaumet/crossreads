<p>June 15, 16<br/>210.<br/>The 5th have had another "Minor operation" today:  at 5 tonight a raid on an out-post and eleven prisoners taken.</p>
<p>Posted away this morning "Raptures" and "Reincarnation".</p>
<p>211.<br/>"How can we find?"  how can we rest?  how can<br/>We, being Gods, win joy, or peace being man?<br/>We the gaunt zanies of a witless fate<br/>Who love the unloving, and the lover hate,<br/>Forget, the moment ere the moment slips,<br/>Kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips<br/>Who want, and know not what we want, and cry,<br/>With crooked mouths for Heaven, and throw it by.</p>
<p>So Brooke fills the accounting of a mood.</p>
<p>June 16<br/>212.<br/>A pass to St. Omer:  so away early.  Down through the fields, full of a splendid sun in a ballade blue and heaped cloud sky, walking was perfect and an elation held me all the way till I struck the main road below Cassel, it was only a short while walking, but each step hardened the thighs for a long marching.</p>
<p>June 16<br/>By Bavinchove rain filled clouds were low, and for a while it rained heavily, then passed to Cassell, and the sun was a hundred times more beautiful after.  Out of a lumbering lorry at Arques, and walking again.  Then St. Omer strung across the fields, and church towers clearly grey solidly standing from massed roofs red and grey and purple, <strike>full</strike> and a tremendous sky of white and gleaming blue.  It was more exciting than the first seeing of Amiens.  Now Amiens is a dead city.</p>
<p>Then a short two hundreds yards of high poplar flanked road, and the outer edge of the city.  Streets like Bailleul's and occasionally narrow, high, steep-roofed old buildings.</p>
<p>In the cathedral &ndash; a walking around about it, and then in through the southern doorways, through the deep high porch, with the strange Judgment carvings above the doorways.</p>
