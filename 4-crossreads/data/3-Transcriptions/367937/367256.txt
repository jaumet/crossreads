<p>Am writing this in the YMCA, just under a ho shrapnel hole in the roof.  The YMCA man here is jolly good: he came all round on the 4th giving out cigarrettes to the chaps just behind the firing line and did not mind the bullets a bit.<br/>Please dont worry over me Mother dear: we are all in God's hands and now we have licked the Turks so much of it is pretty well over and we might be sent back for a rest.  I have not written to Mrs. Wilson and some how dont think I can yet: we do most of our work at night here and you have to get all the sleep you can in the day time although I had a good sleep last night and feel grand today.<br/>Our chaps are were jolly good considering it was their first time and they were all split up from their mates and rushed into it suddenly:  some of them are a bit nervy after it but it has not affected me at all; but I never did have any very great shocks although the concussion of the shrapnel bursting stopped my watch &ndash; they tell me there are very few wristlet watches will stand shrapnel.<br/>It is jolly nice being in with Ronald and he is a splendid officer.<br/>Will go over to the tent and finish this off.<br/>Later. Just found out it was Sunday &amp; have been to a service in YMCA.  The man in charge is a great chap alright.  Think I'll send the other letter after all; its an account of things before we had the dust up.  We were formed up and this evening the Colonel have us a message from the General thanking us for what we had done.  I am glad I got here in time for it.<br/>Love to father<br/>Your loving son Rob</p>
