<p>in the morning, you will be well on in your day's work.</p>
<p>Nov 23<br/>On duty as Quartermaster's assistant for today from 7-9AM. 1-3 &amp; 7-9  P.M, which means practically that I am to do nothing. For, while on duty I have merely to sit on a box in the corner &amp; keep a tally of the sporting material etc used by the Company &amp; besides I have four hours off between each shift during which time I can read &amp; write.<br/>And so here I sit on my box, munching ginger-nuts and half-asleep. I read a number of poems by Mrs Browning this morning &ndash; most of which are really excellent, especially that one entitled "He giveth his beloved sleep"</p>
