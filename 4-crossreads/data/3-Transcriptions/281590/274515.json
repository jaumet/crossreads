By cheek we managed to secure PT in about 80 or 90 coins. &frac12; &amp; &frac14; PTs predominantly. Only saw the biz part of Jaffa &amp; they were dirty but believe the residential or better portions are fairly decent. Saw one street with shade trees &amp; rotundas in it. Roads approaching it bordered on both sides by orange groves, trees being laden. Saw large numbers with laden donks &amp; camels Jaffa bound. Do not trust the devils L of C being brought well up.
