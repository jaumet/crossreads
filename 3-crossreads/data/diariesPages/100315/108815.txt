24/4/18 ? Lavieville
A busy night with bright moonlight. At 3.20 died very bravely young Barker a good boy, upright, capable, brave and everything that a gallant young officer should be ? and one of our originals. With Waxman he took our a patrol to endeavour to cut off a Hun post. He was reconnoitring and had gone forward about 250 y. with Waxman. They were half-lying half-kneeling listening when suddenly two Huns appeared on them. Barker halted them and fired. They also opened but had automatic pistols and a full burst ripped into Barker's groin.
