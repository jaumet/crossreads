 Wednesday 29 January 1919 Met Johnny Walker at 9.30 & left Sobie at 11 am for Charleroi arriving there at 1. Went to the Club for lunch & then out to Chatelet to see Dad Hunter Had to wait about 3 hours for him. Had dinner with him & then slept the night at his billet. He looks as well as ever. Light fall of snow.
