<p>Dear father,</p>
<p>being born under a lucky star, I am on leave with the general, so the next ten days will be rather crowded, which is only another way of saying that this letter is going to be short.</p>
<p>Gen'l Holmes is the best gamset &amp; most efficient officer in the British forces. 'Quae cum ita sint' [that being the case] I am the luckiest A.D.C. in the army.</p>
