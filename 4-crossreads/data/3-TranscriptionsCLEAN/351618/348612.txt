  
 Monday 30th August It is nice & cool early this morning. I got a few more letters & Papers which had been amongst the bags on the sunken barge. Went to Ordnance to get Bags Boots & Tunics etc. Saw Olly Gunderson. 
 Tuesday 31st August There is a tinge of Winter in the air & it is lovely after the hot days. Our chaps are commencing to cover themselves up a little more. There is not that absence of clothing on their backs that I spoke of some time ago. 
 Wednesday 1st September 1915 There was a decided change last night & I felt the chill of the air as I had to unceremoniously leave my bed for the rear. It was about midnight at the time & I had five others to keep me company when I arrived
