 9th.  Our 1914 stunt is getting very close now, they are collecting all of us in No. 10 Cam I expect I will be going there in a day or so all going well a fellow can begin to get a sight of Aussie now.  They have taken all our particulars again.  I don't know how many times this makes & I expect there will be a lot more of it yet before we eventually get clear from the red tape sins. It is simply an awful day nothing but rain rain when will it ever clear up & give us a little sun to cheer things up.
