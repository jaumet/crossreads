 Dear Harry, Yours of  21 8/18 to hand &amp; pleased to know you are both well &amp; ditto myself. Plenty of work over there now eh Harry  &amp; don't hurry yourself over here &amp; remember the old saying "when on a good thing stick to it". Yes it is nearly time you thought of getting hitched up old Boy but I think you like a lot of Sweethearts. Well old Pal since writing your last letter we have been constantly on the move  &amp; have only just pulled into this position so things are slightly topsy turvy &amp; have just been relieved from doing some galloping between Waggon Line &amp; Battery. George Vincent (not Vietmeyer now) tells me things are fairly quiet at Marlborough St owing to shortage of materials. Au Revoir till next Old Boy. Best Regards to Ellie. Old Pay Norman 
 Did you receive my letter of 18 8/18 Harry? Have had no acknowledgement to date.  Norman.
