Dear Mrs Fry
A line to let you know that Alan & myself are in the best of health & spirits. We are today crossing the line & preparations are going ahead for the reception of King Neptune. The sea today is just like glass & the weather beautiful. We expect to arrive at Colombo about Monday & expect to stay there for at least 50 hours. I am of course going ashore although NO leave is to be granted & am arranging for Alan to go with me. "INFLUENCE" again. - We are running a magazine on board & I am acting in the capacity of Editor. I am having it printed in Colombo & Alan is sure to send you a copy which you will find very amusing. Kindest regards to all
Sincerely Yrs.R Thompson
