"Either you are wayback outside the danger zoneIn which case you needn't worry,                                           Or you are in the danger zone.                   You are in a safe place or you are not         If you are you needn't worry                            If not you either get wounded or not        If you aren't wounded you needn't worry              If you are it's either dangerous or slight         If its slight you needn't worry                          If its dangerous you either get well or die               If you get well you needn't worry                      If you die you can't worry               So why worry at all
