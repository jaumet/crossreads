1915July 29 Thu.Have great fun in Gezira Gardens after tea in the evenings now.  Strike up acquaintances with kiddies of all nationalities who play about there, & speak to them in a mixture of French & English. Quite decent practice in French conversation.My companion in these strolls is Ray Smith - a very decent chap.
