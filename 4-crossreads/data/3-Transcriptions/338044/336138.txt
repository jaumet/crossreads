<p>1915<br/>Dec 26th Sunday<br/>A quiet Sunday. Very tired &amp;  after church rest until afternoon, then taking a trip to the Pyramids</p>
<p>Last night we had tea with Madame Alice &amp;  the girls &amp;  some music    &amp;  entertainment afterwards. It was indeed a pleasant change.</p>
<p>Dec 27th Monday<br/>Again night duty from 12 midnight to 7 am. As the weather is very cold it is not only unpleasant but miserable trying to work all night wrapped up in our greatcoats.</p>
<p>Dec 28th to Dec 30th<br/>Plenty of work &amp; no amusement. Nothing but sleep &amp; work so not very interesting.</p>
