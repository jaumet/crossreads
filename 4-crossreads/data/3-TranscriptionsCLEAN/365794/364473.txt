  
 Tuesday 13 March 1917 [12 March 1918] Morning pass & took voting papers to H.Q., voted for Tohine [?] of course (no alternative).  Met C. Garland & he gave bunch of carnations "for the boys".  Whist drive 6-8 p.m. enjoyed by us all, tea etc. 4 p.m., about 34 pts. & 9 whist tables.  To play with our pts. in a friendly way is so easy for me and so difficult - I imagine - for the British sisters.  Thank heavens I am first - a Nurse, 2nd, a machine for tidying beds, etc.
