<p>Dear Uncle</p>
<p>Your last letter which arrived a day or two ago was written on Xmas day and must have been pretty quiet for you, of course you could make up for it afterwards. I spent mine on Lemnos and it wasnt too bad, anything seemed pretty good then without the restraint of the trenches still fresh in our minds.</p>
<p>Am proud to have been amongst the last to leave the Peninsular, it seems to have caused more stir than the Landing itself. Of course we had a terrible lot of luck and for once in our lives things worked without the slightest hitch, one little mistake at the finish and practically all of us would never have got off. I remember, when whispers of the proposed Evacuation were going round, thinking at the time that we hadnt as possible chance of getting away without terrible losses</p>
