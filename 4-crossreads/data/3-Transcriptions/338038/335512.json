<p>It was in the second engagement on "Menin Road" that the Major was gassed &amp; seeing I left two days after he I had been close for I know nothing of his second entry into the line.<br/>I will take the trip to Lane Cove one of these days &amp; will let you know when I am coming.<br/>Hoping I find you well.<br/>Yours faithfully<br/>H W Fane Sgt.</p>
