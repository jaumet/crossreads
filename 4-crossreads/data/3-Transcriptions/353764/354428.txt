<p>a visit to a place which was once used as a Slave Market.  There is also a place at the end where they used to kill all the Girls who were not pretty &amp; consequently were never bought.<br/>This place is now turned into a fashionable piazza with a stage erected at one end of it.  Its chief purpose is to lure men into it &amp; once in you meet all manner of <strike>prosti</strike> the higher class prostitutes, mainly French Italian &amp; Spaniards, who all try to lead you away to their various haunts.  It was only to satisfy curiosity that I went in &amp; it goes to prove again what a beast of a place this is.  To say that the whole proceedings are disgusting would be to put it mildly &amp; I didn't stay there many minutes.<br/>I have now thoroughly re-equipped myself in clothing etc. &amp; will throw my previous issue away on leaving here.<br/>Our French Interpreter arrived in Camp to-day.</p>
<p>22.3.16 Wednesday<br/>Another scorcher of a day &amp; also plenty of hard work on account of the arrival of plenty</p>
