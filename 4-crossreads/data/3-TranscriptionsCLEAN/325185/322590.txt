  
 is to be the flag ship of the fleet.  I have signed on as storekeeper this time so have a pretty good billet.  I  will be very glad when we get away from here.  This laying alongside the wharf is just rotten.  I have been wondering where Bert is.  If they have started to fit the Atua up.  Mr Anderson the extra 2nd has taken ill  and  won't be abel to go with the boat now.  They are taking him to the Hospital tomorrow.  So it is hard to say who will be 2nd steward now.  There is a new Chief on board a Mr Marsh.  There is no need to say I am very pleased at the idea of getting away with the boat.  Perhaps I will wish I was out of it before we return but will chance that.  I know I am not on a pleasure trip but what one man can go through.  I won't be far behind.  There is absolutely no news Father will write as soon as I hear definitely when we are to sail.  Now don't worry about me I will turn up some day like the bad shilling perhaps a bit the worse for wear but that is all.  I will write you every chance I get.  I haven't time to write Bert or May but give them all my love.  Tell him I am up to my eyes in work & dog tired.  They will let me off I know.  Remember me to the Miss Smiths.  Love to all.  Your sincere son Clyde
