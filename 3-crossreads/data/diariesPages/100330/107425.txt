I was told that one of our Drivers his Fireman the Guard had been injured up the line. As it was Moonlight, Fritz had been giving us a bit of trouble when the nights were clear, as he had been dropping Bombs all along the line. These 3 chaps were working for the 268 Coy of Royal Engineers up at Arrival Farm about 5 miles from here. There work was Laying Ballasting the line as our Boys advanced. At about 10 Pm these 3 Chaps were sleeping in a Dug Out at there Depot as the end of the Dug Out was weak a Bomb dropped by Fritz exploded blew the end in seriously injured all the three they had been taken to the Hospital. We received several rumors that they had been knocked about very much but as events turned out they had only been slightly hurt up to date are somewhere in France in a Hospital if not in Blighty. I had a easy time all night until about 7 am
