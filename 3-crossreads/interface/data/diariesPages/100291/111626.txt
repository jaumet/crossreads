1917 Tuesday 19 June
No.1 Con Camp gave their Revue. "Oh I say" last night. Very good had to leave before 'twas half over go on duty. 
Williams very ill still. Awful stench arises from his wound in lung. We had to put him outside much to his distress. Poor kid. It is here in the hospitals one sees all the horrid sordid results of this war. The maimed broken manhood all so futile worthless.
