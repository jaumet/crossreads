To day received another issue of boots & trousers. This morning in our early morning walk we went as far as the Sultan's Palace in Heliopolis, & also a place owned by a French Baron, it is the most fanciful building I ever saw, covered from top to bottom, with moulding & carving & there is a lot of beautiful marble. Heliopolis is the place for beautiful buildings.
