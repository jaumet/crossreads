  
 suffocated & wind still blowing. Beds full of straw & stones. Cannot wash, so go to bed dirty. Tents rocking & threatening to go any minute. Thank goodness the flies are nearly all killed. The fine dust seems to suffocate them. 
 14/416 Few letters turn up  amongst them  the answer to Colombo letters. Big whirligig (whirlwind) is heard approaching  & every  body begins to yell out "look out." As it swept along it knocked over the cooks joint & cleaned up as it blew through the camp. It missed our tent by a few feet or we should have been homeless. Makes a fine noise when on the move. Cold winter wind blowing all day. 
 New reinforcements arrive & begin to lay down the law. We won't stay here they said  "We are leaving for the artillery & they began to get the names of those who " were going to transfer." Very nice to hear them say so. At the railway station after tea some fun took place.  We are the fellows that shook things up in the riot said one fellow". I'll bet he wished he had shut up. His awakening will probably take place tomorrow some time. These men are the ones looked for & they will get snouted. This fellow did get slathered up. His face was a perfect picture & it only  took one hit to paint it. You see they are far from home & sympathy here & riots are not fashionable. Fights are easily bought. More fun promising. 
 15/4/16 Reinforcements still arrive. Fights  easily bought still.Freddy goes to Cairo 
 16/4/16 Hot as hell. Wash clothes. 
 17/4/16 Ryan goes & reports Bon & I off parade & Bon gets towelled up by Serg Toby. I get pick & shovel work digging a trench but get out of it by working my head. After breakfast go out with buzzer & get called back with orders to go to the Sig Coy at the bottom of camp near Tel-el Kebir & railway station
