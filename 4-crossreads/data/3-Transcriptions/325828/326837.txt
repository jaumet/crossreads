<p>[Post card from Parkes showing the Catholic Church]<br/>Tichborne,  1.6.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 7.6.15<br/>Tuesday Night</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Just a brief note before mail closes.  I have just returned from the Dr.  Went in just after dinner, &amp; filled in necessary forms at Police Station, that I handed to the Govt Dr. (Dr. Johnson, with whom Dr. Walker is in co.) but he wouldn't pass me on account of my leg.  Nothing serious he said &amp; with care would be right in about a week.  Advised me to try again end of next week <u>if the wound is healed</u>.   Will probably go in on Saturday week &amp; try again.  Very frosty weather fine but cold.  Am keeping well<br/>Love to all at home<br/>from Leo.</p>
