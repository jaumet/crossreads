 our Division of Artillery was ordered to advance in close support of the Infantry. My Battery was the first to advance and we got into action without casualties &ndash; Then however we lost our best officer, Maurice Fergusson, only wounded but he had to be sent away. On the whole we got off lightly and things have now settled down to their normal state  Maurice Fergusson was out as F.O.O. for the Battery and did splendid work &ndash; He was allright a few days ago and expected to go to England for convalescence. 
 I am finishing this letter off rather abruptly   and  as no time to write more at present and I may not get any opportunity to continue it for some days. 
 Fondest love from Your Son Terence
