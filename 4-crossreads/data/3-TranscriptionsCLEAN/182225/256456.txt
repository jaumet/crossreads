 1916   SUNDAY 3   DEC. 
 Fine & cold. We had very early reveillie & went out with all guns & firing battery, & first line waggons & did our second shoot in the morning & did fairly well. We had our covered position first & then advanced open position. Got back early & wrote letters in afternoon. Was on horse picket at night. Ophir Taylor was over in the afternoon but did not see him.
