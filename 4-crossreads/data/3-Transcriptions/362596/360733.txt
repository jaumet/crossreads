<p>slight touch of it but I got the Dr to inoculate me I got done 6 times so I ought not to get bad now with it.<br/>I see in the papers where there has been a record harvest in Australia so things ought to be looking up over there now. Young George Mc Mahon is in the same Battalion as me so I get the Riverina Graziers off him, his people send it to him from Carrathool so I get a fair amount of the local news. They have been sending me the Hillston Spec and Lone Hands from home but I have only got one paper and two L.H. so they must be going astray somewhere.<br/>Well Tom news are very scarce over here so I will have to draw this stale scrawl to a close hoping you all are enjoying the best of health as the departure of this leaves me OK.<br/>I remain<br/>your Aff. bro.<br/>Clarence 19th Battalion<br/>I am sending May a P.C. of Anzac and Mandros where I spent Xmas</p>
