 Dig, dig, dig!  At the first signs of dawn we were ordered "to Stand to Arms" and prepare for the attack which we felt sure the Turks were about to make, in order to recover their lost ground.  But they have evidently begun to realise the full force of Australian doggedness and cussedness and resolved that it would be useless to attempt a recapture.  Towards midday I noticed we were gradually being enfiladed by a concealed machine gun, and shortly afterwards I stopped a bullet in the calf of the leg  When I found that the wounded could not quit the trenches till nightfall, I determined after being trodden all over by men passing water and ammunition to try and bolt for a protecting gully a distance of 20 yards. With a ramp [indecipherable] assistance I climbed on to the parapet of the trench and while I was in the act of wriggling down the bank on my stomach, snake fashion, that dirty dog of a machine gunner ploughed a bullet through my - you know where!  At any rate, I reached cover and was conveyed to a dressing station by the stretcher bearers.  From there to the clearing hospital the shelt. [shelter ?]  M.O. men took me in charge and in the evening I found myself safe on board a hospital ship.
