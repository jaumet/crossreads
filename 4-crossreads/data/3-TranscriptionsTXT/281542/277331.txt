 &amp; had a "grand banquet".  The journey was full of such incidents &ndash; at Zazazig we were allowed to get off the train to stretch our legs &amp; buy what refreshments we desired. 
 We arrived at Heliopolis at about 6, after a short march from the Station. 
 Much impressed by the residential appearances of these suburbs of Cairo.  Wide tar-paved streets with mostly big cement colored houses bearing the resemblance of flats.  The majority contain gardens &amp; everything has an air of grandeur about it. 
 We camped on the desert &ndash; great many were already under canvas &ndash; British, Victorians, New Zealanders &amp; N.S.W.  In fact all Australia is represented. 
 Great bustle in camp.  Cheered all along the way of march.  Glad to get rid of packs. 
 Slept on the desert outside mess-room which is built of light wood.

 Reveille at 5.  Breakfasted at Heliopolis at a French Restaurant.  Heliopolis is within Camp bounds.  Pass needed for Cairo. 
 Heliopolis I find is regarded by the natives as a Holy Town.  Here it was, I am told, that Joseph converted Mary &amp; wooed her.  What a mixture of humanity is here.  Arabians, Soudanese, French, Italian, Swiss &ndash; in fact all the polyglot crowd of the Northern Africa.  What a shrill cacophony greets our ears &ndash; the bargaining natives swarm round us with their goods &amp; exhort us to buy at extravagant figures.  As we sit at breakfast small Arab boys, dirty &amp; ill clothed, cry for backsheesh &amp; grovel &amp; scramble in the dust for cigarette ends. 
 Breakfast cost us about two piastres, equivalent to 5d. in English money. 
 Our O.C., Mr. Richards, arrives from Suez.

 Daily Routine &ndash; Reveille 5.  Early parade 6 to 9 a.m.  Breakfast 9-15 &ndash; as soon after early parade as is possible.  Lecture 11 to 12.  Parade 5 to 7 p.m.  The morning parade is a killer &ndash; 3 hours on an empty stomach &ndash; we shall without doubt get "fit" under these conditions or "go out to it" altogether.  As it is impossible to drill for any length of time in the midday heat
