<p>Isle of Lemnos<br/>31/9/15</p>
<p>Dear Uncle, Aunt &amp; Cousins</p>
<p>It is such a long time since I have written that I will commence with excuses. Since the end of last March we have had no opportunities. We began preparations for leaving Mena camp &amp; embarking then, &amp; were in Lemnos for three weeks on the transports before our landing. For at least two-months after landing I did not have the chance of writing a letter home &amp; for the rest of the time we averaged an issue of one piece of paper &amp; one envelope per man per fortnight. We have been relieved for a spell after twenty-one weeks incessant fighting &amp; solid work, so I have seized the opportunity to purchase pens ink &amp;</p>
