  Final Board  
 Today I went for my Final Board. I had a good go at my Faithful Briar and when I went before the Major the D.A. was very pronounced. He gave me a good overhauling and said to the clerk "As marked" so that meant B 2A. Oh well, now that is over I can write and tell poor old B.E. about it. 
 I wonder what they will do with me now. 
 Quite a number of chaps got marked A class, so I did at least do a bit better than them. 
 Sat June 1st 
 Gee: I'm getting quite a lot of mail lately. Today got 2 Letters from France, one of 'em containing a Pound note for a Birthday present. Poor Kid, I'm mighty sorry she has been sent to Salonika. It's not too pleasant by all accounts. 
 She also enclosed a snap of herself and am glad to see her looking so well. Got letter from Eric Herford. I really ought to write some Letters, but I'm hanged if I can settle down to do anything in this place. Something in the sea side air makes me very restless.
