<p>Tuesday 28 August 1917</p>
<p>Musketry on the Range:-  wherever a Standing Camp is made TARGETS are put up to keep the mens' "eyes in" &amp; to exercise the new drafts of Reinforcements &ndash; which come along from the BASE. Some are Bushmen &amp; some are <u>not</u>.</p>
<p>40 c/s of Comforts from the Aust. Comforts Fund for the Regiment arrived last night. Tinned Fruit Juice, Pickles etc. &amp; some excellent Khaki Shirts for the men. Not the least valuable were the cases for Firewood, which is always a very scarce commodity in this part of the Front. In FRANCE no doubt they have plenty.</p>
