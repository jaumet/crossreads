<p>July 17th contd 26<br/>British officers left this camp today for presumably Frieburg. I shifted from the Frenchmans barrack to the room with Gallagher &amp; Ingram. It is much better being here, I feel more at Home. It is quite a relief to release one's feelings at times. We three have formed a mess &amp; pool all of our food &amp; we are quite a happy family.</p>
<p>The food is prepared by us &ndash; taken to the cookhouse to be cooked by our orderly. We have Bkfast 9 am tea at 4 pm &amp; supper at 9 pm. We draw 2 plates of tin food from parcels room  daily at 10 am.</p>
<p>Leickler to the Infirmary today. He has a rash on him.</p>
<p>Invited to supper with Cull &amp; McQuiggan, it was quite a treat to have a feed of bully beef again. To bed at 11 pm</p>
<p>The English communiques are translated by Capt McKenzie daily &amp; published in a book. Joined a french class for beginners today, I am going to learn french. it is very difficult.</p>
<p>This camp is very spacious &amp; it is quite a daily occurence to see officers promenarding all around the camp for exercise. There is a Physical Jerks class at 7 am daily &ndash; very few attend needless to say.</p>
