Aug 8 Leaving for Portland at 12.15 to go aboard the ? Marathon. Met Bill Kent this morning. He expects to leave in the next boat. Left Camp at 12.30 & went on Board about 3 pm. Not a bad boat at all, & rather bigger than the Karoola I think (9000 tons, & can do 16 knots) Left Portland (escorted by a destroyer) at 3.30. Was M.O. for tea. Tucker fairly good. Beautifully calm sea & lovely weather. And just about 14 months ago the Karoola left Sydney Harbor (outward bound)[in margin] (Portland) (At Sea)
