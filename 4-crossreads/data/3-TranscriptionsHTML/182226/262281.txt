<p>Thursday 16 September, 1915</p>
<p>Letters from home. Mater, Dot &amp; a very nice one from Beryl.</p>
<p>Am right once more &amp; will go on duty next watch.</p>
<p>The watches have been changed from 18 to 24 hrs.</p>
<p>The chaps in the big shed started to mend the roof &amp; had half of it off when the rain came on &amp; gave them a bad time of it.</p>
<p>Had a sharp shower which however did not last long.</p>
<p>The Turks turned their attention to our post last night, one shell which failed to explode landed very close to our quarters. About a dozen others landed on the crest of the hill.</p>
<p>Stray bullets occasionally fall about our humpy one came very close during the night &amp; made us feel a bit uncomfortable.</p>
