  
 We caught a Remora or Sucking fish this morng  -  He was slate colored - about 2 feet long & had an oval sucking disc about 5  "  inches by 2  5  on the back of his Cephalothorax  -  (combined Head & chest) There is much difference of opinion as to whether he is edible  -  One remark was that he was too much like a shark to be good eating though I believe young shark is not bad  -  Personally I don't want either  -  Fishing has been a dead failure - here & at Ribaul & in the coral sea  -  The natives in Fiji fish out by the reef at night time but no boat may leave the wharf after Sunset is the Flagship's order & so we don't get fresh fish  -  I saw yesterday the long nosed form of the Garfish swing alongside & this morng  -  a Bonito was chasing small fry  -  The morng  -  & eveng  -  are perfection  -  At  the  sunset the West streams gold over the heavens & the sun goes down in a golden chariot  -  Midday is hot but all around its glorious stimulating champagne weather & so we end week 10 of war  time
