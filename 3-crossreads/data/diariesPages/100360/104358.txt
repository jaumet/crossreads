Tues. Mar April 3. The Y.M.C.A. Hut manager sent in today to know if we would put on our Show on Thursday night, so we are busy now arranging a Programme.

Wed. 4. Good news in the Paper at last. America coming in the War. So now we are hoping that Fritz will throw up the sponge & let us get back to Sunny New South. Hooray. Mail came in. Got 3 Letters from M.S. Now I can write a decent Letter in return. The Prince of Wales attended the Anzac Show in Albert. Bob Roberts offered to put us in the seat among the Heads, but we have a rehearsal on, & I can’t afford the time.

Thurs. Mar April 5. Commenced Letter to M.S. Glorious day, sun shining gloriously. Plenty of planes about. George Hand went into Amiens, so I was left to run the Show.
Johnnie Moore also went to Amiens & failed to return. Horrie Playford & Wally Saunders did not like to go on without him, so Freddy Saunders had the Piano to himself. He did very well too. Everything went off very well & the crowd was most appreciative.
