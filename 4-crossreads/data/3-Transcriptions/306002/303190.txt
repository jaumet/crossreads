<p>14.6.15<br/>reported 16,000 reinforcements (mostly Australians) landed to day a couple of mile south of us.  I suppose that accounts for the warships fire.  About sundown to-day we witnessed the most interesting fight I have seen.  One of our torpedo-boats (a cheeky little beggar) came in close to shore &amp; opened fire at something on land;  big shells immediately began to fall all around her, the Torpedo boat would stay still for a few seconds &amp; then go full steam ahead for a few hundred yards then she would zig-zag, then stop then back away, then full speed ahead again, firing all the time &amp; the Turks shells would follow her up falling <strike>were</strike> where she had been a second or so before;  &amp; although the splash from the shells often fell on the boat none of the shells hit;  one of the Turks shells would have been quite sufficient to sink her, warned to go on sapping at midnight.</p>
