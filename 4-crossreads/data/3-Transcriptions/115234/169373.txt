<p>reigned a silence, dread</p>
<p>The ancient city might have been, some stronghold of the dead</p>
<p>No bursting bomb nor screaming shell, our presence dared to Censure</p>
<p>So we chanced our luck &amp; swept along, upon the &quot;Great Adventure&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through hideous gaps in masonry o&#39;er scattered heaps of bricks</p>
<p>While vagrant tiles from burning homes were falling fast &amp; thick</p>
<p>With finger on the trigger pressed &amp; nerves strung trim &amp; taut</p>
<p>At last we&#39;d reached the Mecca for which we&#39;d toiled &amp; fought</p>
<p>Imagination played us tricks unto our morbid fancy</p>
<p>(to be continued)</p>
<p>some day</p>
