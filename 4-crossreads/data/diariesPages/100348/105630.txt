Marched about 7 miles to the railway at St.Omer. Entrained at 4 A.M. It seems a nice city, but this is usually our share of these big towns. Tramping through while it is asleep. Passed Calais, Bolounge and Etaples; detrained at Longpre. Crossed a fine stream, the "Somme" I believe and halted at this village; L.Etoile it is called. The name means; "A Star". Besides other things Rum! can be purchased in this exellent place; so the warriors are happy. There is an old roman camp on a hill top near, the ramparts and other defences are still to be seen. It is shaped like a star, perhaps that is how this place gets its name.
