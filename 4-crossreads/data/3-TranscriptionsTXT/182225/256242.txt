 MARCH &nbsp; FRIDAY 31 &nbsp; 1916 
 If in this life you wish to win 
 And rise above the common chump, 
 Take off your coat &amp; pitch right in, 
 Don&#39;t wait, lay hold, hang on, &amp; hump. 
 &nbsp; 
 It ain&#39;t no use to grumble &amp; complain 
 Its just as cheap &amp; easy to rejoice 
 When God sorts out the weather &amp; sends rain 
 Why, rain&#39;s my choice
