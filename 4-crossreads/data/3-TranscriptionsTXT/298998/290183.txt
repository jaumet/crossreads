 large party has been detailed to entrain to-day. Frenchmen captured in the early stages of the war, tell us that prison life in Germany is considerably better than prisoners hospitals accessible to retaliation sector in France. The food is more substantial, and the general treatment is less severe. This news is very encouraging. I have existed on soups and black bread up to date; my white bread was stopped this morning, so I must accustom myself to the black, that however, will not b e difficult now, as I am only too glad to get anything eatable. I think I have lost my palate. The ordinary diet is as follows:   Breakfast 7-30, coffee. 9.30 six ounces of black bread. noon (dinner) bowl of "saur kraut" or swedes in hot water. 3 p.m, cup of coffee; tea 6 p.m, Bowl of hot water and two table spoonfuls of barley. The barley water, in color is uncommonly like dish-water, and smells odiously. The dinner soups, probably have a little dog or horse flesh mixed with them, possibly to give  it  a greasy appearance, incidentally it improves the taste. One seldom receives any of the meat. In the event of a stroke of good luck, it is merely a fraction of an ounce, with the nutriment stewed out of it. Dangerously bad cases occasionally receive a small piece of flesh as described above. Occasionally a Russian manages to steal a loaf of bread from the cook-house; in this case he invariably offers it for sale. I dare say he withholds additional quantities for himself. Money is absolutely valueless here; those in possession of a few francs, are glad to purchase food regardless of the price. I offered forty francs for a loaf of bread this morning and the offer was refused. Jam is purchaseable sometimes. It is sold in eight ounce jars at six marks. Soap is an exceptionally rare luxury, and is obtainable only through Russians. Half penny tablets, cost four marks. Where those fellows get it, is quite a mystery, as Huns are unable to procure soap for themselves. French cigarettes are procurable at 1 1/2d each. Unfortunately, very few of us have money to purchase with. Most of the men were robbed before reaching Valenciennes. My few francs are decreasing rapidly, however, I am glad to spend, as I shall probably be robbed later.
