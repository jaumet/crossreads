  
 Thursday 8 February 
  Unexpectedly inf  Arrived at Le Havre 4 p.m. after passing the Portuguese Army on their way up to the front.  Marched straight to the boat.  Stayed on deck for an hour or so in the lifebelt box, then we managed to secure a cabin down below.  I put on a sergeants coat and went in with them for some supper.  Left Le Havre at midnight.
