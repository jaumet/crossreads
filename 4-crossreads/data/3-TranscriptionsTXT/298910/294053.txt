 Got a very rude awakening at 2.30 am &amp; told to be at our posts at 6 am. Some 50 Bearers moved out to various Posts &ndash; Myself &ndash; Deshon &ndash; Woods &amp; Longden, went to Wye Farm &ndash; near Bois Greniers  Our part of the line had to give some sort of a demonstration, while something big was going on at Armertiers &ndash; At 11 am, we got word that the stunt was not coming of as arranged, we had to stay at our posts till 1.30 pm &amp; were then told to get back to Nouveau Monde, I never said a word after carrying stretchers &ndash; dressing, sick &amp; tucker for 3 miles &ndash; Drizzling &amp; rain all day. 
 20th  Monday 
 Very nice day. Got orders to go out &amp; relieve bearers at Foray House &ndash; Here myself &ndash; Page, Bowden &amp; Gurner found a very [indecipherable][indecipherable] out, got 3 cases during the night &ndash; very heavy artillery firing both sides &ndash; 30th strafed Fritz with bombs for an hour &ndash; Plenty of shells coming very freely around our dug out, but beyond stopping our freedom, done no harm.
