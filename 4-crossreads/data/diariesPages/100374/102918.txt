into an Estaminet.

An Estaminet is a place where you can buy coffee, beer, wine, eggs and chips etc. These are of great benefit to the hungry troops and a means of profit to the French people who own these estaminets

These estaminets usually have a notice board above their doorway and I have found the translating of the French words painted there on a great source of amusement and instruction in the French language. For instance one sees a sign "Au Faison Gris" and on looking up the dictionary one finds the meaning to be , "To the grey pheasant", "Au Petit Bois" to the "Little Wood", "Au Printemps", "To the Springtime". By translating these signboards, advertisements, etc one finds this an easy and interesting way of increasing one’s vocabulary of the French Languages. The names of these Estaminets are usually of a picturesque nature.

Major Campbell spoke to me of my leave home. There being only 1 warrant out he asked me to put my leave off till next week and there would be two warrants out, so that D.I. and myself would get home on leave to-gether. I agreed.
