 After dinner the Mess Order are again busi , while the men loung about , or play quoit , card , or other game , until " Fall in " at 2 p.m. call them again to duti . At 4 p.m. the " Retir " is blown , and at 4-30 the men are dismiss for the day . Tea is serv at 4-45 p.m. , when invari a hot scone , with chees or bulli beef , and jam , compris the even meal . After tea , the boy are again at play . The piano , which howev , is the wors for wear ( except for the one which the Y.M.C.A. lend for Concert c. ) is made use of to the some extent . Here and there you will find a man with his flute , Cornet , or Mouth Organ , and the strain of old familiar tune rend the air . Box is a favourit pastim , and is much indulg in , while gambl , I am sorri to say , goe on almost incess , although the latter is punish accord to Order . At 7 p.m. Hammock are drawn , but as the night are get warmer , the men , instead of sleep down on the Mess deck , are to be seen choos their quarter on the upper deck , where they slumber peac under the star . It is quit a sight at night to see them stretch out in row along the deck , while other are hang to the rig , or tie up to spar or other gear . Much amus is caus , howev , if dure the night a storm should disturb their slumber . Down come the rain , and a general scatter is the result , men and blanket scur [scurri ] for shelter . Some , howev , sleep right through the shower , and in the morn they are to be seen asleep under their waterproof sheet , just as if it were the best of weather . To walk the deck when the boy have decid to sleep on deck , is a tricki busi , requir some skill to avoid put one 's foot on either a head or an arm , when the ship has some roll on . As the day go by , other duti come into forc . There are time to be set apart for the wash of cloth , and as all Unit cannot do their wash on the same day , seper day are set apart for each unit . On those day , line are hung with articl of cloth of everi descript , but whether the color of the garment as they hang on the line would make a good advertis for Sunlight Soap , it is question , still the cloth are clean , and that fill the bill on a troopship . Other day are set apart for " Make Mending" , the air of blanket , check of kit and equip , hammock , c. I must mention here that there is on the ship , an Inhale Room . Parad are made to this room at frequent interv dure the voyag for the purpos of fumig . About 50 men enter at a time , and by mean of a steam pipe or tube , emit steam at a point conjoint with anoth tube contain Zinc Sulphat disinfect , it send into the atmospher of the room a steami vapour which is inhal , and becom a destroy of ani germ that might be lurk round . This is necessari on board a troopship where a number of men are group so close togeth for say a coupl of month at the least . Next to this room is the Isolat Hospit , but of cours no access is obtain to it from ani part of the ship except by the step lead up to the one and onli door , and at the foot of the step a Guard is post . Befor I proceed further with this narrat , I would like to dwell just a moment on the subject of bird life at sea , and other item of pass interest , which may be just a littl off the point , but worthi of note . Befor the ship is mani day on it journey across the Ocean , the sea bird make their appear . The most notic is the Albatross ( remind one of " The Ancient Marin " ) which I might say is almost a constant companion , especi when in mid ocean . This bird fli around the ship day after day , in search of food of ani descript that may be thrown over the side . If it were not for his presenc , life on the sea for the troop would be void of much interest , as a transport general keep well away from the ordinari trade rout , therebi minimis ani chanc of see a pass sail .
