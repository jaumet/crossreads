untill they were promised leave. The officers tried the 2nd Div. with the same result. The Light Horse were then halted. The Canadians went on alone and finished the march alone, the Aussies never seeing them after. After some parlying with the Officers the Infantry took up the march and the rest of the Parade followed. Thus through the mean policy of the A.I.F. authorities the Victory march nearly collapsed. All the men taking part were expected to return to Sutton-Veney the same night, a few did arrive foot sore weary at 10.50 P.M. making nearly 24 hours continuous Duty. There ought to be an awful row in Aussie when the people hear about this.

Went to Dancing class this morning, all men, very funny in the sets. We have here the very latest Dances. At Havre (Harfleur) they held Classes. I met quite a few good Dancers who had never Danced with a Girl in their lives.
10th-5, Saturday
We had C.I. parade this morning and a Boat roll was made out. I understand that we leave here on the 18th and embark on the "Nestor" the following day. I intend to go to Bath today. There is a party leaving here this afternoon. Fare 10/-.
I have been told that the W.A.A.C.s have the same medical Parades that we do. At Havre the girls (among themselves) used to call them canoe inspections. The weather is becoming much warmer lately. We had lovely weather for our trip to Bath (20 miles) and
