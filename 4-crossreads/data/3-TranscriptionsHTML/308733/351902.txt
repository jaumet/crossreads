<p>Dear Uncle<br/>Many thanks for your letter and news from Liverpool, any news of the old camp is very refreshing to us. We have read a lot about the Commission and the evidence given, in the papers sent to us, some of it rather amused us as we knew the witnesses pretty well. Of course to get to the root of the matter is to see plainly enough that the site of the Camp is unsuitable.</p>
<p>Expect you would have known almost directly when we landed here, as some of the chaps have had letters from home saying that there were rumours in Sydney about us being in action on a certain date, unlike most rumours they were correct. We were lucky enough to have been apparently used as a reserve, had few casualties ourselves but another Battalion had a very rough time indeed, they were badly mauled.</p>
<p>We relieved some L.H. from our present position which is more in the nature of a garrison although one never knows when our present steady routine almost, may be busted into frantic activity, any advance here would mean all or nothing to both sides so they are content to sit tight and indulge in almost daily artillery duels with the advantage to us.</p>
<p>The boom of big guns at Achi Baba and up the peninsular can be heard almost continuously and of course that is were we think all active movement is taking place. I might say in passing that we know less of the local happenings than you do. Also our letters are censored.</p>
