3/1/17 Thistle Tr
Turned in at 2.30 am and awakened at 5 to supervise compilation of the Intelligence Report which left here by runner. Sniper had been giving us a deal of trouble and patrol located him. It is proposed to kill him tonight. Beyond hearing coughing and talking nothing else was seen except some large working parties behind their lines who were observed on gun flashes. Taking out a flare pistol tonight so as to locate a working party and put artillery on it. Slept again until 9a.m. and then breakfasted afterwards walking round the line. From battn. H.Q. to AB H.Q.R.s is about 600 yards across open troubled ground and bad mud. A few dead men lying about one with bloody disfigured head. Noticed a few steel helmets lying round with big holes in them and a number of rifles with fixed bayonets, their owners resting in graves alongside. Bodies soon moulder in the open. No shells very close to us. Found Hogarth Main with about 40 men in a deep dugout rather badly constructed but warm and a place where men can sleep
