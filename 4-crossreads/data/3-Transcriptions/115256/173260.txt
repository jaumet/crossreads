<p>Friday 1 January 1915</p>
<p>Enter 1915!  But without that host of "good resolutions" with which one is accustomed to welcome the New Year.  There is absolutely no time for that sort of thing on a troopship.</p>
<p>At Muster Parade to-day, a death on the troopship "Borda" was announced;  and, at 11.5 a.m., when the body was committed to the deep, the troops on the whole of the fleet, were called to attention for a minute or two, the fleet slowing down for 15 minutes.  The first death occurring on the first day of the year, was looked on by many superstitious people as an ill-omen.  However, the holiday, which was given to the troops, was fully enjoyed.  Two cricket matches were played &ndash; the 13th Battalion v. the 14th, the officers playing one match, the men the other.  Enthusiasm ran high, as it practically amounted to a match between the rival states, Victoria and N.S.W.  Myself being a N.S. Welshman, the latter won, of course!</p>
