  
 31.10.16 Tue 31st Another mob of Remounts came in today & we managed to get rid of 5 of our horses as we have not the men to ride them & they were sent to the Squadrons. At 3.30 this afternoon we led two horses each from the lines & went round in a large circle marching past Gen. Dobell who was inspecting them then filed on to water had a lively time riding my horse bareback as he roots a bit but I managed to come out on top once again. It seems a certainty that we are going out past Bir-El-Abd the day after tomorrow & we cannot post letters here after 8 oclock tonight.
