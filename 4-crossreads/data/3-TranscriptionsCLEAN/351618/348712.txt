(Military Landing Officer) & we were shifted by means of transport to another wharf & he told me we were likely to leave for Egypt in a few days & the Baggage would not go into the Sarpie Camp - the place where our Units were joining up after coming away in small batches. We made ourselves as comfortable as we could near the South Pier (wharf) as it was called & waited instructions. I sent word to Sarpie Camp & got a few extra men down to guard the Baggage etc. They came down & walked over there & slept for the night. Saw Walter
