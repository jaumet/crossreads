 to have their cloth issu out to us , it is onli natur that we should like our own distinct uniform best , all like to look like Australian , you should hear the men perform swear some of them refus to have anyth at all to do with it , they prefer to wear their old Australian uniform , till it almost fall off their back rather than wear the English uniform quit right . I fail to see whi they ca n't keep the suppli up to us , rather than let it go to some of the shoddi manufactur contractor in England from what I have seen of the various manufactur articl dure this war , well Australian good have noth to fear by comparison if a line can be drawn from such articl
