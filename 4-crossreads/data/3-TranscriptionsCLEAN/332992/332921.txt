 Tuesday April 24.1917 A beautiful day.  The sky is blue & clear, and the Sun is shining out bright & warm.  Fritz put over 4 shells this morning, two of them close to the Q.M. store & two in our old billets at 11.30 square.  after breakfast he put over about a dozen.  He seems bent on destroying Armentieres before evacuating Houplines. Throughout the morning he continued to put in more shells, & by dinner time must have put over fully 30.  Enemy aeroplanes were about all morning but very high up & just about 12 one of our planes succeeded in bringing one of Fritz's down, admidst great excitement & rejoicing of the people who exclaimed "Tres Bon" very good.  Bon English.  The plane came down almost vertically & at an acute angle, & I believe fell in his own lines. [Shorthand entry not transcribed] Later news to hand says that the enemy plane fell in our lines & burst into flames before falling.
