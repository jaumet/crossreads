My Dear Mother
There is just a chance that letters posted at Gibraltar may arrive before these posted in England, so I will drop a line. We expect to hit the rock tomorrow morning early. There will of course, be no leave. Yesterday at dusk, we were pulled up by a French dreadnought. She came very close to examine us & they gave us three cheers.
