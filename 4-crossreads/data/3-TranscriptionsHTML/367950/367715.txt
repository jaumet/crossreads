Also (report says) Armussi our previous camp was bombed (the <strike>a</strike>  New Zealanders are there) but don't know the result. We are as bad off here for news as if we were thousands of miles away Its surprising. For instance a Taube comes over and drops bombs on a neighbouring Camp or on one of our railway stations we hear the rending crash of the bombs quite plain and see the white puffs of smoke from the bursting shrapnel all round the plane and see the plane depart for home at top speed generally to prevent aerial combat with our machines. But we scarcely ever hear the result of the air raid So the only reliable information is anything which happens to ourselves.</p>
