<p>We landed Heritage at Rabaul &ndash; not at all a bad chap but a bit of a bore I should think &ndash; Fitz has an idea he's twisted his inside!! &ndash; what he's done is fall flat on the water &amp; bruise his abdominal muscles &amp; he feels it when he moves &ndash; Getting into a boat from the water is also a young active man's game &ndash; not a flabby fat one's &ndash; I'm nice &amp; thin &ndash; I think I weigh less than when at GI &ndash;<br/><u>Breakfast</u> - Biscuit &ndash; treacle &ndash; cup of coffee &ndash; Finish. I'll tell you a curious fact in connection with the 1st Australian Contingent &ndash; Not a padre &ndash; not one &ndash; Here's 1500 men &ndash; more - &amp; many of them used to a religious Service &ndash; but not a service ashore &ndash; no worship &amp; this is British &ndash; A <u>good</u> padre is a most helpful chap &ndash; Some <u>live</u> padre should come up &amp; go round &ndash; He'd do a lot of good &amp; be heartily welcomed by men &amp; officers &ndash; There's sick &amp; dying men here &amp; anyone of us reads the Burial Service &ndash; There's more for a Padre to face up here than in Europe &ndash; I know &ndash;</p>
