<p>&amp; chignons &amp; cameo brooches.&nbsp; What an atmosphere of homelike peace &amp; [doth ?] these things carry.&nbsp; And now mute &amp; pathetic they clutch at ones heartstrings and I think of other homes in a far off land beneath the Southern Cross &amp; pray to God that war may never cast its sombre pall over mine own dear land: down the street, the tinkling of&nbsp; a cracked &amp; discordant piano salutes our ears &quot;Good Bye&#39;ee, dont Cryee</p>
