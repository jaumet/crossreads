News of Kitcheners death
96 wks of soldiering
More rumors are to hand re the naval flight informed us that the news of them getting on to their mine fields is confirmed but it seems too good to be true. Word came through early this morning that Kitchener all his staff had been drowned on the Hampshire whilst proceeding to Russia, it seems she either struck a mine which had been cast off during the last naval engagement or was torpedoed off the Orkney Islands, a heavy sea was running at the time little hope is held out for his life, the Hampshire is a cruiser of the Town class was one of our escort from Australia. Aeroplane reconnaissance today all clear as far as Bir-el-Abd where there are about 1000 of the enemy. Bed midnight.
