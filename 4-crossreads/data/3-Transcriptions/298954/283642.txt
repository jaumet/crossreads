(porridge &amp;, perhaps, bacon.)<br/>(By the way, James &amp; I have been allotted two seats on the dias overlooking the whole room.   Poor James, the old dear, bore the blaze of publicity with a shrinking spirit for a day or so but he may now be heard laying down the law in his ripe "Geordie" accent.   Further along at our table are Captns Moodie, Roberts, C.E. Byrne, vis-&agrave;-vis is Lieut Hall, &amp; on my left, his back to The Assemblage, is Horne.)</p>
<p>Appel on the terrace 9 am.<br/>9.30 to 11.30 walking.<br/>Noon till 1 p. lessons.<br/>1 pm.   Lunch. (Chefs Morton &amp; the Queensland Meat Co., but Moodie occasionally casts us scraps of his rabbit pies.)</p>
<p>2 pm. till 3.45 p.    One takes one's choice of another quick walk or of the "yachting party".</p>
