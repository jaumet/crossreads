<p>our old style &amp; methods of living.</p>
<p>We had a stoppage this morning from 9 to 10 on account of a steam pipe blowing out in the engine room. Our firemen are giving more trouble   they are I am afraid a bad lot, they threw their dinner today all over the officers saloon &amp; also heaved the pudding over the Chief Steward, some way of carrying on isn't it, the food question again, this time I am satisfied that they are in the wrong for I made enquiries &amp; saw the food for myself &amp; its practically the same as we are getting so heaven only knows what they want, it's a pity they could not have been with us for a while on Gallopili or 1916 in France, they would have known something about poor food &amp; short rations then, I don't suppose they have lived better in their life than they are now.</p>
