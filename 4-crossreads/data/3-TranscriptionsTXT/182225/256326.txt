1916   WEDNESDAY 26   JULY
Fine & warm. Round town with Alan in morning & got some tickets for the Palace theatre. Went to Auntie Florences' for lunch & came back & met Pitt at the Goring and we went out to the Zoo. It was pretty slow. Pitt & Mr Porter his mate, stayed to tea at the Goring  We went to "Bric-a-Brac" in evening with Mrs Angus & Auntie Florence & on to the Savoy after for supper we went down to the dancing after. Mrs Angus took Alan & I riding in Rotten Row in the morning & it was great to get on a decent nag again for a bit.
