 Tuesday, 24 August, 1915 All day our Navy bombarded what we think to be the Narrows, we only hear the echo here &amp; it is like the rumbling of a thunder storm.  We hear news of a great victory in the North Sea in which the Germans lost heavily including a super dreadnought the wireless to-day was very pleasing, the first news was that Italy has declared against Turkey so she will soon be here.  Venezelos has been sent for by the King so it seems imminent that Greece will chip in.  three hundred Turks were captured last night they surrendered easily. 
 Wednesday, 25 August, 1915 I went into the trenches to-day, up to the Cheshires and whilst a machine gun officer was showing me a look out a bullet grazed his scalp, a deliberate snipe.  To-day I heard the saddest, pluckiest thing of the war yet heard of a man of the Wilts Regt. was brought in on a donkey being too weak to walk, this is his story, when the [indecipherable] &amp; [indecipherable] retreated &amp; lost the trench he was asleep and awoke to find he was cut off from his regt. &amp; surrounded by Turks, &amp; another of the party were the only ones not wounded &amp; his lieutenant forbade him to leave him they had no water or food and after attending to the wounds of his mates he was surprised to find five Turks standing alongside him with all his arms &amp; ammunition, seeing there was no hope he asked to be taken prisoner but they gave him a drink of water &amp; shook hands &amp; left them, the next night they came down again &amp; robbed the dead &amp; wounded &amp; away again but would not take prisoners then three of them tried to escape one man being wounded but the Turks promptly fired on them &amp; they had to go back they found a dead Gurkha &amp; he had some biscuits there they shared with their wounded mates, the wounded were dying every day through starvation &amp; their wounds were eaten by maggots &amp; blow flies but they held on &amp; on the ninth day without food, this man managed to escape &amp; crawled to the N.Z. hospital where he ate like a savage a search party have now gone out with this man to relieve the others.
