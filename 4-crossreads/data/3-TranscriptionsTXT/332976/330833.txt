The section is bilited in an old loft which they are repairing.4th    To-day has been miserably wet & cold, snow & sleet falling practically all day the morning & until about 3 P.M. when it cleared up a bit.   Two of our observation baloons went up between here & Bapaume & at about 5 P.M. one of Fritz's "Taubes" came over & brought them both down in flames, but was himself brought down almost immediately afterwards.  (About 3 days ago he brought down the one that was stationed opposite us in Villers au Floss.
