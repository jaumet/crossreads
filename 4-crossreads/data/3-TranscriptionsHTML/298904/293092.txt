<p>How it makes you sick of work<br/>And its pity help the Turk.<br/>Who bumps you in the next fierce bayonet fight.</p>
<p>The smiling faces meet you<br/>And hearty laughter greet you<br/>When all discuss the news of their home town<br/>How it makes a man feel small<br/>If he's cared for not at all<br/>And no one cares a rap if he goes down,</p>
<p>So show him you really care<br/>And when you have time to spare<br/>Just drop a line to him who bears the brunt,<br/>Its not a great deal to ask<br/>And will ease his heavy task,<br/>Theres someone waits your letter at the front</p>
