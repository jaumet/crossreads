Guinea & on to the Admiralty islands & then back here - 'quien sabe' I say - What  we want  - is - fresh food - Fanny Adams - (I told you tinned dog is called F.A. in the navy) gets on your nerves - meal after meal - I manage fairly well - rice is my staple article of diet - 'Though your sins be as scarlet yet shall they be white as wool' said the Chief Engineer to the mess gathering as we all got our bills & everything was squared - Wash out - all sin - all indeed - all 'frantic boast' & foolish word'
