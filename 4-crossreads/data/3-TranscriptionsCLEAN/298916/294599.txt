wait until the rest have finished. The wave length is altered by the varying of instruments in coupling & capacity. The signals, listening to the transmitting, are like pistol shots, the current jumping across the spark gap with a vicious spurt. To those familiar with electrical machinery it is like a "kick", only decidedly pronounced.
In the receiving station they are received in a pair of head telephones in the form of  a sharp "purr" - in the form of dots & dashes as the morse code is used. The tone is generally very soft, unless very faint in the case of long distance or loud if anywhere near. The pitch varies a great deal but in the case of the Telefunken system the note is piercing & cannot be mistaken. This system has many advantages over the Marconi system, & is generally used on high powered stations. Atmospherical disturbances such as storms, perhaps hundreds of miles away, all cause the ariel to respond, as a lightning discharge has no fixed wavelength & may be called "broad wave". Moisture, dirt, etc all cause serious trouble & at times put a station out of service. Wireless is very whimsical & subject to changes in the temperature, & the presence of any electrical machinery, especially alternating current.
