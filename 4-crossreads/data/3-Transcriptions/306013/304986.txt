Like lots of others he speaks English &amp; Dutch well &amp; has a fair idea of the Kaffir tongue. In fact he started teaching me the Dutch. During the afternoon I had a couple of dozen cheap fruit &amp; some toffee &amp; we four sat along the footpath &amp; had a fine little party all to ourselves, much to the amusement of passers-by &amp; much to the gratification of the natives.
