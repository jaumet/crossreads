<p>have thought that we were still in France only for the inhabitants we passed having a somewhat darker skins of an Italian type and then soon after the  town of Monaco with the reigning Prince's Palace came into sight on an elevated spur to the right. A few minutes later the tram arrived at the terminus and our destination &ndash; Monte Carlo with its Casino, a couple of hundred yards away and gardens in rear in which people who stake their last franc on the roulette table (&amp; lose) are supposed to commit suicide &ndash; I never saw any, but perhaps we were there too early in the day. or perhaps it was not the right time of the year. We went up the steps of the Casino &amp; into the Main Hall past several gold laced gents. Leading out of the hall was the Concert Hall in the centre, a money changing dept on the right &amp; the salles de jeu (gaming rooms) on the left. The latter we found we found we were not allowed to enter &ndash; entrance being forbidden to anyone in military</p>
