<p>be seen for miles   The country is just broken here &amp; there by small rocky hills.<br/>We had great difficulty in getting drinking water because the sentries would not let us out at the different stations.   However we did get out at one station &amp; we got in conversation with a Russian civilian who spoke English.  He told us we were going to the  <u>Angora</u> , chief town of vilayet pop.40000 celebrated for mohair where there were other English prisoners<br/>We arrived at Angora at 11 pm &amp; after a short time a strong guard of Turkish soldiers came down to the station to march us away.  We were marched about 3 miles to a large buildings on a hill.  This proves to be the American Agricultural College.  During this short march we were badly treated being pushed &amp; knocked with the butts of rifles.  We got to the building at midnight &amp; were put into 2 small rooms.  There were a few spare mattresses but not half enough to go round.<br/>On the morning we found that the crew of Submarine E 7 had arrived a few days before also a few soldiers from different regiments recently captured at the Dardanelles.</p>
