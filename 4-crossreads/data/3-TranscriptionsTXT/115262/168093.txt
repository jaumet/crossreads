Thursday 22 November 1917.
Went to Ramleh with 15 patients in sitting cacolets to Anzac Receiving Stn. which is in a modern building of modern architecture & was formerly a church & a hospital.
Had a look through the Monski. What struck me most was the ancient oil press & Bedouin plough shop where Bedouin plows are made & repaired by ancient methods.
Returned to bivouac at 4.30 pm.
Moved to new position on advance 5 miles further on the Ramleh-Jaffa road.
Reported to Bgde Hd Qrs as despatch for 24 hrs.
