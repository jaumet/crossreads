<p>be an example to the men.<br/>Arch writes me asking me if the car is unsold in 3 months time whether I would be willing to let it go at &pound;300. He says he has an offer at that figure. I am writing him to sell at that price if unsold in 3 months time. I think it would be better to sell even at that low figure rather than let it deteriorate. If you want to use the car I think father would gladly let Gowing drive it for you. He is a very careful man &amp; I would not mind him driving it.<br/>Fred sends his love to you.<br/>Au revoir best old Mrs &amp; may God bless you all while I am away.<br/>Your loving husband<br/>W.H.
