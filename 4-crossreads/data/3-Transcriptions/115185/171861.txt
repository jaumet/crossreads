<p>2 &ndash; brought my own mosquito net. They are coming with the stores but meanwhile we shall be devoured by flies. We do not know when we shall get our first lot of patients. I only hope we shall have food &amp; water when we do. I'd love <strike>the </strike> a daily papers once a week if you could post them to me. We hear no news here. In England one is much nearer the dear ones at the front in knowing about them. They might be wounded in the next ship to me and I'd have no means of knowing. But one has to expect that. To come out as a nursing Sister is just to do ones job. I am very well. Many of the sisters have had stomach attacks but I'm alright. We all have inoculation for cholera on the way out from England. I long for news of you all. Of course I have gad none [indecipherable] in 3 weeks today since I left England.<br/>Much love to you.
