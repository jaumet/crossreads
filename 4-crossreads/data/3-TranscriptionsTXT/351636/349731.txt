 Dear Mr. Layton &ndash; Can you give Mrs. Meagher some temporary assistance her case is known to you as you formerly assisted her, &amp; when she thought she could do without it, gave up the 6/6 per month you gave her, but at present is in great difficulties which she can explain 
 Yours truly E. H. Bennie.
