  
 Pension Wales.     R 4.5.16 Cairo. March 21st. 1916. My very dear Father & Mother, We have heard no general order concerning the outward mails & so am going to continue writing & posting: it seems to be a military order as far as we can see.  I hope you received my post-card last mail telling you that Wal Le & I were together, I was anxious for you to know as soon as possible & wrote it in a cafe while we were out. It was about 3 o'clock on the Tuesday that Le marched in much to my surprise & delight, though really I hardly knew him at first, he was so dirty & had a moustache, and of course I had not been expecting him.     He was up partly on duty to see about the removal of some of their black kit bags to another base (which looks like a move & his bag is among them.)  We had a yarn for about half an hour & then he had to go to the Headquarters till about 6.30 & that just fitted in with my afternoon business & we arranged to meet after it.  In the meantime I sent Wal a telegram telling him that we would come out in the evening, for I was afraid of missing him otherwise & it seemed the only chance that we might have of being together as Le expected to leave next morning.          Then after we had had dinner together we set out to Wal's camp & found him without any trouble.  Wal arranged for him to go back & sleep there with him & then they came back into Cairo with me & we had supper & ices & yarned hard all the time.  It was then that I wrote the post-card to you.
