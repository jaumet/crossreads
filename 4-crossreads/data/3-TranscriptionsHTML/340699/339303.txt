<p>plans may be broken up. However it doesn't much matter - there are other! There are two visitors from H.Q. here. I think that when they go back I may ride with them and get my mail. It's a long ride and I don't like going alone. I feel I want company. A call has come .and I have to go.</p>
<p>Bois d'Escardonneuse<br/>July 24, 1918<br/>Yesterday was a very wild and wet one. My friends Capt. Harrison and Lt. Bayliss came out to lunch and as they were riding to H.
