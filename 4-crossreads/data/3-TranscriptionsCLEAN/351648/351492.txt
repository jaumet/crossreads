  
 her eyelashes & eyes, I don't know their colour but they were sombre with such fads of humour & captivating, tantalizing Chabalrie when she smiled & her laugh soft & yet infectious, like her voice which was well modulated & she played the piano very nicely.  I woke so much in love with her I had to write this straightway.  Find her for me Babs please, I might add that she was somewhat of a flirt & kept me guessing, her greatest charm no doubt - produce her & my scalp goes with it & my worldly goods.  She'd probably turn me down with a Club third &  then  I'd wake up.
