Sunday 4th JuneCommunion service held in the lines so a good number attended the parade being in my charge.  The weather very hot again & swimming was the order of the day.
Monday 5thReveille now at 5 AM parade 5.30  Roll call then dismissed for breakfast.  6.30 A.M. fall in.  Drill & swimming parade till 10.  Fall in again 4 P.M. generally for lecture altho' the men have been cleaning up the waggons for inspection by General McKay who is very strict on transport harness etc.  Man ran amuck the previous night & after firing at several ended by shooting himself in the arm.  I was passing at the time but did not realise the seriousness of it till later when I learnt he was firing deliberately.  Still no definite orders for disembarkation.  Heat in the shade today said to be 114&#176;F.  It was very hot indeed, wherever we sat we left a wet patch behind the perspiration simply pouring out & to cap it all a dust storm came up.  We are having an easy time however.
