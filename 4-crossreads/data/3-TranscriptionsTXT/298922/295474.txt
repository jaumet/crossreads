Thursday 7 June 1917
From 27 May to 7 June missing.
[The following paragraph crossed through.]  Our H.Q's were bombed yesterday & NOWELL FORTH's horse died from wounds on previous day - demoralizing damn thing but a fog last night hid the moon. Still anxiously waiting our turn on the Beach.
Scorpions are very plentiful also snakes & the boys going on leave take them to Cairo to amuse!!! the CASINO girls. The Scorpions bite is no worse than a Bull dog ant except when the female is mating - then she eats the male if she gets a chance & will fight anything.
Last night I got a Centipede 8" long - Cairo is full of snake charmers & jugglers & our boys try to follow suit with sometimes disastrous results.
