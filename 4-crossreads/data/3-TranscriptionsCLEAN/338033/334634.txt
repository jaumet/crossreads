  
 Boats are anchored in mid stream in place of being berthed at wharves, owing to the shallowness of the water near the shores. Coal, water and all other supplies are bought across by means of barges, which are usually tied together in threes and towed by tenders. Passengers are taken ashore by means of these tenders and landed at the prettiest jetty I have ever seen. Just as you leave the jetty you are right in the business centre with the tramway junction quite handy.
