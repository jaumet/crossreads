<p>I am having some quaint experiences in the Bedouin Houses, where we patrol &amp; each place kills a Cock &amp; we eat it almost hot, all with our fingers, &amp; seated on the ground.<br/>Our Guide the Marmoor every night says tres fatigue, they are very poor horsemen-<br/>The AMP Society would raise my premium if they knew the filthy cups of coffee we are forced to drink for fear of offending the friendlies.</p>
