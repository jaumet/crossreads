<p>MAY&nbsp;&nbsp; SATURDAY 20&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Very windy &amp; cold. Still they keep me in hospital but may get out tomorrow&nbsp; It seems ages since I came in here. Read all day. The time we took writing letters yesterday was wasted as we are not calling at Freemantle but making straight through to Durban.</p>
