 She was "hove to" for about two hours. We steamed close up to her, she being at the rear of the lines. It was found that there was a meeting amongst the firemen. They had "struck" for some reason. Capt. Glossop ordered that two should be shot every four hours until the others remaining resumed work.   It has been reported that after 6 had been shot the rest returned to work. Some time yesterday it was thought advisable to send the "Kanowna" back to Townsville which was accordingly done. 
 Fifty men of the Royal Naval Reserve from Melbourne, who had shipped on the "Berrima" were sent aboard us under charge of Lieut Bowen; Surgeon Pockley being also attached and an R.N.R Sub. Lieut and a midshipman. These are to be compose a landing party, probably at Rabaul to capture the wireless stations on New Britain. 
 We have heard the "Nurnburg", of the German Squadron visited Fanning Id and is supposed to have captured it. Her main aim would be to interfere with the cable station situated there.
