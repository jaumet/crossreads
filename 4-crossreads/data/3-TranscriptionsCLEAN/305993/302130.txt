The police native & patrols were not sufficient to deal with the disturbance.  Consequently at 8.30 p.m. all hotels & shops were closed yet it still went on.  Also marching through each picture show with flags flying as they the mob passed.  Extra patrol troops were called out & by mid-night after dealing with hundreds of troops severely, they left for their respective camps.
