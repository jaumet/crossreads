fighting at Bullecourt. They had had a very strenuous time there and it had made a marked effect on him.

May 17th. Thurs

Had our O.T. all packed up on Motor Lorry. Left for Bailleul seated on an easy chair fixed high up on the back of the Motor Transport. As we left the Village we caused quite a stir as there were three men and a dog on the top of the car as well as me seated on the back.

On our way we passed battalions of Australians who had just come out of heavy fighting at Bullecourt. There seemed to me to be an extreme expression of sadness on all their faces.

Near Bailleul is greatly taken up with the growing of Hops.

May 22nd. Wed.
The C.C.S. making rapid strides to-wards completion.

Went to the Cinema to-night.

As there is a large Aerodrome just outside the town we have plenty of exhibitions in flying here.

May 23rd Thurs.
Walked out to Saint-Jans-Cappel and climbed Mount Noir, at the top of which is a windmill. Just a few yards from this windmill is the gate which marks the Frontier of France and of Belgium.

A magnificent view is to be seen from Mount Noir.
