 S.S. Ascanius, High Seas. 
 At about 4 p.m. on October 30th 1914, we heard the familiar voice of the Adjutant, Lieut. J.H. Peck, warning the Officers of our Battalion 11th A.I.F. to report at once at the Commanding Officers Tent.  After the many disappointments regarding the date of departure we were too slow to attribute any special significance to this order, but nevertheless promptly carried it out.  We found the Commanding Officer (Col. J. Lyon Johnson) awaiting our arrival.   After the customary morning salutation he informed us that Marching Orders had been received and that we were to make arrangements forthwith in our respective Companies to entrain for Fremantle at Helena Vale Siding, which is situated half a mile west of our Camp. 
 By noon the whole of the Battalion less two Companies, "A" & "B" were on board the Troopship Ascanius, and duly quartered. 
 The two Companies, "A" & "B" embarked on the S.S. Medic.   I found the Troopship a vessel of 10,040 tons very comfortably fitted out for Officers, N.C.O.'s and men, and a striking contrast to my mind, to the Troopship accommodation provided during the last South African campaign.   We found that, with ourselves the 10th Battalion, South Australians, and the crew, we had nearly 3,000 souls on board.   Allow me here to mention that to care for our spiritual welfare we had his Lordship the Right Rev Dr Cyril Golding-Bird, Bishop of Kalgoorlie who ranks as a Captain, in the Battalion, and the Rev Father John Fahey, who also ranks as a Captain, who is entrusted with the care of our Catholic brethren.  Two Doctors attended to our Medical welfare namely:-  Dr E.T. Brennan Perth, Senior Medical Officer and Dr Nott, Adelaide, Junior Medical Officer.   Four Military Sisters comprise the Nursing Staff, two from South Australia and two from West Australia. 
 The troopship is fitted with a fine Hospital and every facility for caring for the sick.  At
