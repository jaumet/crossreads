through the shoulder, we got 1 officer 8 Fritzs as prisoners during the little side show. There was a terrible heavy barrage put over by our guns this morning, we all thought an attack was coming off, but it appears to have been only a "practice barrage" Old Fritzie dropped some heavy shells round our Quarter Masters this morning he caused 1 casualty, that was a little sparrow who was knocking about on the road looking for his breakfast he had one of his eyes knocked out one of our chaps picked him up is looking after the little "spadger".
Have been busy getting fatigue parties off for drawing ammunition, sand bags rations etc ready for our move tomorrow. Another dry fairly fine day, weather still remains quite mild for time of year. Rumours are flying round about Russia throwing up the sponge etc, time she did either one thing or the other at any rate for at present she is a drag on us. Len came back tonight brought some more men for the Company
