 April 1918 Tuesday 2 In Billet &ndash; Orville Bombed during early hours of morning. No casualties.  A great number of R.A.M.C. arrived enroute to line, from Italy. During afternoon I performed the erroneous duty of Marker on Battery manoeuvres. Weather beautiful. Had a swim above the wier with Russell. Went along to Santos with Ken Gunn. Missed the boys so came home very early. Met Adranne &ndash; "a bon petite Cherie"
