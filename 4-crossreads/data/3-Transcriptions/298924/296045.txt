<p>Tuesday 4 March 1919<br/>Had Jim Ayre out to dinner - &amp; had a good yarn, he is a great old scandal monger &amp; loves a yarn.  It will be news to you but of course strictly confidential, Dolly thinks she may be having another Babe in 8 months time &ndash; so am keen to get settled, but we hope it may not be so yet.<br/>Dolly has a big appetite compared to any of our family &amp; eats as much as I do.  Of course she is nursing her Babe herself &amp; she is 7 months &amp; gets no artificial food of any sort.</p>
