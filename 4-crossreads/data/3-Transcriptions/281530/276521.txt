<p>3/7/18<br/>Seized with illness during the night and had a complete relapse of "Dog fever" &ndash; shivers, sweats, pains etc. The doctor came up and said temp. was high. Duggan sent off today.</p>
<p>4/7/18<br/>Still ill. At zero 3 am our Bde hopped over in conjunction with the 4th Division on the left and assisted by tanks. The attack was carried out by the 21st &amp; 23rd with 24th in support and ourselves in reserve. The barrage opened rather raggedly but soon settled down to a good bombardment. The going was fairly easy and not a great deal of opposition. By noon we knew of 1300 prisoners for the whole stunt of which 130 were taken by our Bde. The 21st got a tank gun &amp; 21 m.g.s. Got up and shaved about 6 pm and realized then that I was very weak again</p>
