<p>1916 &nbsp; TUESDAY 20 &nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>A fine warm day again &nbsp;We were issued with our black kit bags for an hour in the morning. I put a lot of things out of my sea kit in to the black one &amp; gave it back. We had a little physical culture in the morning under M<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Neylan. Bill Hunter &amp; Self were down no 6 hold in afternoon looking for some harness. Something happened to the &quot;Marathon&quot; as she dropped right behind &nbsp;They say she lost a propellar blade but I dont think thats the case. There is a wireless going round that we are goiong to Marseilles &amp; I think there is a lot of truth in it myself.</p>
