<p>[Transcriber's note:  This, the fourth diary of Sapper Ernest Murray of the 7th Field Coy. Engineers, begins on 1 January 1916 when he is in Cairo where training is being carried out in bridging, pontooning, etc.  He then moves to the Suez Canal area and from there proceeds to France in June.  He describes the fighting and details the work of the Sappers in building bridges, dug-outs, roads, etc in and around the Somme area, Albert, and Amiens.  Leave is taken to London for just over a week in mid November and he stays with friends in Leytonstone.  The diary concludes on 11 July 1917 where he is still carrying out work around Amiens.]</p>
