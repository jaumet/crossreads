<p>Thursday 27th July<br/>Had a spell off duty but still found plenty to do fixing up stuff for my section.  Had a run out in the car to a section of the line passing through one village severely damaged by artillery.  Houses were unroofed &amp; tumbling down, large shell holes in the road etc but still a few of the inhabitants remained returning after the strafe was over.</p>
<p>Friday 28th<br/>Orderly Sergeant for the day.  Absolutely nothing doing.  A few sick patients admitted &amp; C section bearers relieved A section men at the trenches.  Went to the village picture show known as the "Sailly Empire" at night but saw nothing unusual.  Usual bombardment at night.</p>
<p>Saturday 29th July.<br/>Had a spell off duty so did some writing in the morning &amp; went into Estaires in the afternoon.  There was nothing much doing the town being very quiet.  I managed to buy a couple of little things such as postcards &amp; a couple of brooches also had tea with a friend at the 1st A.C.C.H.</p>
