 War Diary continued |The D.T.M.O. of the 41st Div took over on the 12th Nov. and we then went to VICTORIA CAMP near RENINGHELST and with great difficulty in obtaining accommodation. The Town Major told us that we could have what the British Cyclist Corps did not want, the idea being that the Australians could have what the British did not want. On the 15th we left VICTORIA CAMP travelling in 10 motor lorries of the 4th Aust. S.A.P. At ABELLE we joined the rest of the Park. The convey consisted of 44 lorries. We travelled south all that day passing through STEENVOORDE, HAZEBROUCK,LILLERS, RERNES, ST POL, FREVENT and to BOUQUEMAISON at which point we stayed the night, after having great difficulty in obtaining billets for the men and myself, but none for the other officers. Next morning we resumed our journey at 8 o'clock and passed through Doullens, BEAUVAL, TALMAS, ARMIENS   and thence to Albert leaving the remainder of the lorries parked en route. I reported to Anzac Headquarters and was instructed to go to BELLEVUE CAMP. Arriving there after dark we found insufficient accommodation for the men and very poor accommodation for the Officers. I slept in a tent. Bellevue Camp we found to be an example of perfect organisation (I don't think). Infantry arrived there when there was no accommodation and not possessing any blankets, and had to sleep out in the open. The weather was very cold on the journey and is very cold still. The next day I went out and tried to find Div. H. Qrs. and found they were at POMIER'S  REDOUBT just past MAMETX WOOD to which place I got by walking and riding on motor lorries. Roads and surrounding country in a fearfully boggy state. I reported the condition of BELLEVUE CAMP to General COX and asked to be removed elsewhere. The General promised to do what he could and ordered a report on BELLEVUE CAMP to be sent in. On the second day in Bellevue Camp we got up to find there had been a light fall of snow during the night. Obtained billets in Albert from the Town Major, and moved into them and found them very much more comfortable than the sheds, and also we had not to supply fatigues to the Camp Commandant. I obtained my two horses from D.A.C. after much argument. The Batteries were distributed among the D.A.C. and F.A. Brigades for duty. Lt.Anderson goes on leave and Lt. Pinder goes to hospital. General GLASFORD killed in sunken road near GUEUDECOURT. Went to AMIENS and got a petrol lamp.
