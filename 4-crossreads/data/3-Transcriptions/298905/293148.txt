<p>school for instruction, but we had an 8 mile walk for nothing for the school doe's not start till tomorrow, we are to have 2 days instruction &amp; then we will have a practical demonstration.<br/>I felt pretty crook last night, &amp; was very glad when they told us to get back to bed, but sleep with our clothes on. Received a couple of letters this evening from home.<br/>What a difference there is between these people round here &amp; the ones nearer the firing line, I believe those towards the firing line are nothing more than Squarehead's, they certainly are not as nice as the people further back  the real French people haven't got much time for the Flemish they do go crook if you tell them they are Flemish, round Wallon Cappel Hazebrouck</p>
