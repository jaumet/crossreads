<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd Sept. &amp; I will gladly give you the particulars you ask for:<br/>No. 6119 Pvte. Warren Hutchings<br/>1st Field Ambulance<br/>1st Aust. Division<br/>A.A.M.C. A.I.E.F.</p>
<p>I have other splendid letters written by the same person but they contain "personal touches". So I wrote &amp; asked him to write me a letter minus any "personal touches" &amp; I would give it to The Mitchell Library. This he did &amp; sent the letter to England to be posted, &amp; now you have it.</p>
<p>I am<br/>Yours Truly<br/>Dorothy Sawell.</p>
