 Wednesday 9th 
 Not a ripple today.  It is a strange way to put in ones time nothing to do but moveing along all the time.  Someone else is doing the work.  The number of people on this boat would populate a fair sized town in Aussie.  Went to 3 classes to day.  Major Paterson is not a profesional lecturer but he is interesting  all the sam  
 P.T.O.
