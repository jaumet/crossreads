 The news still holds good.  1st Div. have orders to pack up but we have none yet.  The general opinion seems to be that we will go on Saturday.

The nights are getting cool but treachourously moist just now, &amp; one has to guard against getting a chill &amp; one has to keep clothes over one at night even if it is close.
