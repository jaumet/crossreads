  
 67 display, Point Neuf, Parc Mountsouris, Buttes Chaumont, the St Louis both points which to me resemble Hotel de Ville & Louvre. 
 Such a display I have never seen, vast fountains of fire 300 or 400 ft high & continous for 15 minutes or so. The vast spidery webs like a gigantic spiders are glorious. The magnificent rocket displays grander than anything we have had out our way, are simple alongside the other displays. Never have I seen anything to equal it & probably never will again. 
 Below in square there are 30 or 40 thousand people waiting to see the display behind me at Sacre Coeur. From time to time the building is thrown in red [indecipherable] by port fires & at others it is illuminated by 6 powerful held searchlights which are stationed here for display purposes 
 Earlier in night there was a sortege lumineux consisting of a torchlight processions with 800 soldiers bearing torches, bands etc being supplied it formed at Av. d'Antin thence Concorde, rue Rivoli, Chalelet, Pont au Change, Boul du Palais, St Michel, St Germain, Quart D'orsay & Pont Alexandre. There has been one for peace & peace signatures & are always difficult to approach on account of crowds. 
 At 1:0 pm there was a Fete in Tuilueries with concerts & country dancing & at 8 pm a free operatic display at Arenes de Lutece
