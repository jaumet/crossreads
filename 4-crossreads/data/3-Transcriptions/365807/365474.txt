<p>Dear Judge,</p>
<p>On reaching my digs I find the whole text of the cable was not 'phoned to me. It reads as follows</p>
<p>"London   <u>22nd </u>  June<br/>Tell Judge Ferguson I saw Keith and he has made a wonderfully good recovery   <u>hardly any disability now appreciable</u></p>
<p>I am sorry you did not get the last 5 words earlier because it throws light on the extent of the recovery.</p>
<p>I was greatly interested in that Dr's report of Keith's injuries and in coming home looked up some similar damages &amp; find my brother contributed an article on Aphasia to the "Lancet" in 1902 &amp;</p>
