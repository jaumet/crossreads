<p>July 16th<br/>D and myself were picked to go on a Hospital Ship. There were twenty men picked and the remaining twenty five were asked to volunteer. The result was a great deal more volunteered than were required. We were put through a medical test and told to keep ourselves in readiness.<br/>We thought our "luck was in" this time.</p>
<p>July 19th<br/>More patients from the Dards.</p>
<p>Went to the Aquarium which is only a short walk from here. The grounds are very nicely laid out. In the centre is a large Ghrotto. It is nice and cool inside and in niches</p>
<p>swimming about in water, the various kinds of fish which are to be found in the River Nile.</p>
<p>July 22nd<br/>O'N and myself went into town on an A.S.C. Waggon and got off at the Cairo Station.<br/>Making our way down a narrow street in order as O'N said to 'lose ourselves' for the afternoon we wandered on "all dressed up and nowhere to go".<br/>We walked slowly along accosting as we went, native sellers, speaking to them in broken Arabic and by this means added more to our few Arabic words.<br/>As we wandered about we got an insight into the work-a-day life of the natives. <br/>We saw them making the cage-like beds made from the branches of the Palm Tree, the same as the ones which we at present sleep on.<br/>We saw an old man turning wood by a very clever device in the form of a hand lathe. It was turned by means of a bow, the string of the bow being put round the article to be turned. The rapidity by which this old man turned these articles with this ancient device was marvellous.<br/>As we passed a large window we saw a large number of natives with watches in front of them. Thinking this place to be a watchmakers shop we went in to see the time. We were greeted with a roar of laughter by about thirty men and boys seated at tables like the desks in a school.</p>
<p>Much to our surprise and amusement</p>
