<p>press and elsewhere, generally in more or less harrowing style.</p>
<p>Artists have painted it and poets have immortalized it.&nbsp; And yet</p>
<p>there is nothing spectacular about it, just a little drama which is</p>
<p>being enacted every morning month in and month out, Sundays included.</p>
<p>Perhaps our women have grown braver or perhaps the more emotionally</p>
<p>inclined have been presuaded to say their good byes at home, the</p>
<p>early hour being a helpful excuse for insisting on the latter course.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the seeker after pathos would find no gratification</p>
<p>in the scene as it takes place nowadays.&nbsp; Officers returning from</p>
<p>leave are not a very cheery lot and what conversation they do carry on</p>
<p>consists mainly of grunts.&nbsp; The man in the corner who took the tender</p>
<p>farewell of the pretty girl in the blue hat on the platform, sits</p>
<p>vacantly staring out of thewindow and inwardly cursing the war.&nbsp; Next</p>
<p>to him is a chap who has caught this train four times during the past</p>
<p>two years.&nbsp; He reads one newspaper after another and finally bundles</p>
<p>the whole lot up and throws them out of the window through which he</p>
<p>continues to gaze with one of Bainsfeather&#39;s &quot;fed up&quot; expressions.&nbsp; In</p>
<p>the other corner <u>an unshaven subaltern</u> smokes cigarette after cigarette</p>
<p><em>[Note handwritten in left hand margin: </em></p>
<p><em>Poor old C (vide supra)]</em></p>
<p>in an effort to overcome the &quot;nasty brown taste&quot; which his last night</p>
<p>of leave has left him.&nbsp; The next compartment contains a party of</p>
<p>nurses who are returning from their well earned leave after a</p>
<p>strenuous five months devoted to looking after the wounded from the</p>
<p>&quot;1916 push&quot;.&nbsp; They chatter as is their way, and appear quite happy.</p>
<p>The Tommies who fill up most of the train are like a lot of schoolboys</p>
<p>returning after the holidays.&nbsp; They are not the same jovial spirits</p>
<p>who arrived at Victoria a week or so again.&nbsp; Banter which then would</p>
<p>have been met by counter banter, now threatens to lead to blows.</p>
<p>However the feeling will work off as the day xxxx wears on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The run to Folkestone is a very pretty one passing</p>
