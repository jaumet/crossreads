  
 I/m able to do that now. One of my pals Sister Bolton was warded last night Saturday, very bad with rheumatism. She is in the other room, poor girl is suffering most fearful pain, in her R. hand. No doubt she will be sent back to Australia when better. She came on the "Kyarra" with us. Dorothy is still at Suez, has not been up to see us yet. I wrote to her yesterday & sent your message. Mollie &  Jess are awfully good write nearly every mail &  send different weekly papers - so you see I have lots of kind friends. Glad to hear your blouse is a success - I do not think it is any use getting a blouse made for me, unless it is a white muslin &  then I think I could get it here. I must get a new dress of some kind, when I'm about again. Give my love to all my pals &  friends. Tell them I'm always thinking of them even if I don't write. Sorry Mother Peel's p.card went astray, she should have received one by the same post as Emma. Fondest love &  kisses to you all. From your loving sister Edith.
