<p>there &amp;  worked all day until 8.30. p.m. My poor feet ache a lot the floors are very hard, all marble    &amp; have to be careful one does not slip. I shall try to get a P.C. of the Palace &ndash; it is a magnificent building.<br/>Sorry I cannot write any more but will try to write soon &amp; go on from where I have left off. Tell friends I shall try to scribble a few lines to them. Am having a good time when off duty. Mr. C. has gone so suppose I shall have a quieter time. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all  &amp; hope all are well.<br/>Yours lovingly.                                                                                                                                                                                         Edith<br/>Tell Eddy I shall write to him next. His letters are delightful.</p>
