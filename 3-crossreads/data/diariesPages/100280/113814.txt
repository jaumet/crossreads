It has been a glorious day again the artillery has been very active, we halted quite close some of our 9.2 it was very interesting to watch to watch them lift up their black snouts spit for the fire flame steel see them jump back on their recoil springs, then the gunners jump to the gun attend to her wants.
After we settled down Judd I went looking for a canteen to see if we could buy anything for tea, but we had very little luck for they were all sold out
