to Cairo.

After having tea in Groppi’s we walked about town seeing what was to be seen.

The streets were crowded with troops. One saw sights in some of these streets which they are not likely to forgot. At door after door we saw groups of soldiers standing around numbers of young women. One, at a distance thought these young women very pretty, but on closer examination one drew back with disgust at their debased appearance. To make up for their lost beauty they had painted themselves about the face and dressed themselves in a fairly becoming fashion, which would have cheated all but the close observing. There is no doubt that some of these young women had been very pretty. The life they were leading had degraded them.

They were inviting the soldiers up to their rooms which some of them were foolish enough to do. Many of these young men rue the day they entered into hospital, back to Aust – as undesirable, ruined, not only themselves, but others, for life.

Sunday 8th, 9th 10th Wednesday,. P. all back P3.26. Longer hours on duty now.

Everything seems to be in a state of chaos. None of the officers seem to be able to take a grip of the situation and guide the hospital aright.

Eight deaths have taken place since we came here. Went into Cairo along with D.
