My Dear Sherbon;By the "Messina" which carries Prisoners of War from Nauru.  I am sending as Passengers Mrs. and Miss Brauns, who are the Wife and Daughter of Engineer Eric Hans Brauns, who represent the Telefunken Company in connection with the erection of German Wireless Stations in the Pacific.
Brauns was taken Prisoner when the Steamer "Zambesi" was captured outside Simpson Haven in August last by the Australian Fleet, and I understand that he is now a Prisoner at Sydney.
Will you oblige me by making the necessary enquiries and assist Mrs. to rejoin her husband, as at present she and her Daughter are completely stranded.
Possibly Brauns may be a Prisoner at Liverpool, and if he cannot be released on parole, it may perhaps be arranged that his wife and Daughter could stay somewhere in the town of Liverpool until he is released.
I am quite confident that I can leave this matter in your hands to do the best you can for the Ladies under the trying circumstances.
Yours Sincerely,
Captain W.J. Sherbon,Chief Clerk,Victoria Barracks.
