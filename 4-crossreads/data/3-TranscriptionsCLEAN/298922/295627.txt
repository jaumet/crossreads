 Moved out at 10 a.m. in a Convoy with 20 others & escorted by destroyers. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.] Fairly rough & the little Lady is not so happy as usual - & is in bed. Mother I hope you have had my letters from Alexandria - my next will be from Cairo - D.V. 
 Passed the Eddystone Light House quite closely, could see people on the turret. We go I believe a long way out of our course but the longest way round is the shortest way home.
