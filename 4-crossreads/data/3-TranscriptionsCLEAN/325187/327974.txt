 Turk prisoners have brought  CHOLERA  with them so every one is inoculated once more.  I am getting quite white I was burnt black when I came in, & getting very soft lying in bed.  Woke up as a new orderly fainted & fell over the Surgeon DOCTORS dressing tables couldn't stand seeing dressing done so I thought it was a Howitzer.  Sent you a sketch to replace the one lost in "trawler" but am afraid you must wait till I come home to fill in details & explain- Was in Hospital this time last year at No.1 A.G.H. (Palace)
