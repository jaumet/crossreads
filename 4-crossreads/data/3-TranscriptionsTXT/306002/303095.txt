 2.4.15 Fri. 2nd.  This morning we were on the road at 9 oclock &amp; marched through Cairo, &amp; had a lovely ride through fine cultivated lands to the Barrage Delta.  It is 26 miles from Heliopolis.  A Sq. went on Wed., B Sq. on Thur. &amp; we passed A Sq. at dinner time on their way back to Camp.  We arrived at the Delta, &amp; tethered our horses under lovely trees &amp; only a few yards away from lawns, &amp; were told we could go where we liked, &amp; sleep where we liked, so long as we were back for stables next morning.  Stan &amp; I went to bed early close to the horses.
