Monday February 5thThe 13th Batt are still holding what they took last night. Two counter attacks were beaten off. The 13th Field Ambulance also lost fairly heavy.The improvements added to the "receiving point" are greatly appreciated by all. Not so cold today, snow still on ground, but it is gradually thawing.
Tuesday February 6thA terrible windy day. Very strong & cold direct northerly wind blowing. We never started work until 2 pm as we are again changing over from day shift to night shift. Had a terrible head ache this afternoon & after Captain Furber examined me, he ordered me back to bed, also gave me some medicine. Very bilious during the night, which necessitated my getting up three times & my word it was a very very very cold wind blowing, very strong too.
Wednesday February 7thAs this place has been altered to a Divisional rest station & M.D.S. we don't get half the patients we previously got. Cold wind still blowing a gale today. Our tent was nearly blown away. Not felling so bad today. Have rather a bad cough though.
Thursday February 8thReceived four letters by todays mail. Still very windy & cold. Things are very quiet here now. We have a good few patients through here with trench feet, pleurisy, Bronchitis etc. Fritz keeps coming over this way every night in his airoplane. He was flying very low last night, & fired a good few shots out of his machine gun on a road about three hundred yards away from here, but there was nothing there at the time. He was fly500 is the principal card game in the tent, to pass time away.
