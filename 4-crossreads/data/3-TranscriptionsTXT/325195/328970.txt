12.10.15Tue 12thNelson came around to-day to get his pay & he is not likely to go away; Cases of rum were washed ashore in the gale a few nights ago, a good many lads that happened to be along early about Anzac commandeered a few cases, & they are having a merry time around there since Garner managed to come on a plant also & has a good supply on hand; Jock Davidson has been away a few days & Sergeant Wright is now acting S.M. The weather is getting very cold again, & the fleas are a thousand times more nuisance than the Turks are at present, everything is so quiet one would hardly think a war was on.
