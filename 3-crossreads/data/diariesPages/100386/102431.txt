I enlisted on 3rd December 1914 going into Warren Camp at once. The Units in this Camp were 6th and 7th Light Horse Train Railway Detachment New South Wales quota of 1st Australian Field Bakery 13th A.A.S.C. Lieut Col McMorland C/O. Lieut E. Milne Railway Detachment ? Captain Thomas Parker-Cleeve, Lieut. Sherring Smith
The Camp was on a fine site in a Building that had previously been a Convent of Carmelite Nuns The discipline was splendid and Troops a fine body of men. I retain many happy recollections of life in the Warren. Men had plenty of liberty and never abused it. The officers knew their Job. On Thursday 17th Dec Bakery troops marched out to join the unit which was mobilising in Broadmeadows Camp. I was somewhat annoyed as I had formed an idea that I would be able to get a transfer to one of the Transport units. I retain a vivid recollection of my first day in Warren Camp. Sgt Major A. Gordon had instructed me where to pitch my Tents. Neither I nor my mates had ever seen a Tent pitched by troops. However the order was to put them up so we went to work and in a short space of time had them erected. I had been put in charge of the men and felt highly pleased until the C/O appeared on the scene. Have you ever erected tents before he demanded. No Sir said I with some pride
