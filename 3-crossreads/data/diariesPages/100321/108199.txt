19/2/19 Cologne
walked round the shops and I then took the Battalion colours down to the Rhine and from a landing stage dipped them in the water. Round the Fishmarket there are old dark narrow streets and old aged buildings ? quiet squares. To the Cathedral and went inside. The hot dull smell of incense and warmth. Many windows removed. Before a Service commenced an old beadle in scarlet gown cleared the course. At 4 p.m. went up to the Opera House with the others and saw Mozart's Magic Flute ? a complicated thing magnificently staged. The promenade at the theatre here is very fine. We were in a box which cost us nothing at all. After dinner we went down to the Cologne Bologne
