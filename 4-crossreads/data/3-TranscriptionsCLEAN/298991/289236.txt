Entered the Harbour & pulled alongside the wharf about 2 p.m. Red Cross Ladies brought flowers, fruit, cakes, books & papers on board, all were very acceptable. 
 All West Australians disembarked about 3.30 pm. The "Borderer" arrived about an hour before us. Sailed 5 pm this afternoon. Colonel Meeks our O.C. disembarked at Fremantle, we lose in him a very good O.C. & gentleman. It was a grand day. There were very few people on the wharf to see the ships in.
