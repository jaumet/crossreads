  
 About 3 pm I went to the beach & met Dr Ireland who told me the party was off  -  It seems the Grantala nurses, earlier in the day, had had an invitation from the Governor & his wife unbeknown to Mrs Ireland - so the affair was postponed  -  However some 7 of us had aft t at the Grand Pacific Hotel & put in a pleasant time  -  Suva is a very one horse place though pretty (Look up Fiji in the Australian year book - red backed -on our shelves - near Webster I think)  -  This hotel was built & finished last May  -  The Union S.S.Co of NZ  built & run it  -  It is far before any Brisbane hotel  -  There is a grand hall with balconies around it - Large, lofty, luxurious  - We had tea there - 4 ladies & 3 mean - We then inspected the place - the roof is fine & you get a view all over the harbor - when this hotel is lit at night - she looks like a man of war coaling at night - there is such a blaze of light everywhere -
