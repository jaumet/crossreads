7/1/18 Penzance Taunton
Another dull day. At 8 o'c it was still quite dark ? a heavy grey sea tumbling in. Breakfasted and then took an omnibus from hotel to station and caught the 9.45 a.m. train for Taunton. Had a good journey with some merchant service officers who had been torpedoed only a few hours before. Crossed the Dart with old wooden three deckers on it and some ships of the navy. Very beautiful scenery round Exeter and right through to Taunton which we reached at about 3. Went to the Great Western Hotel ? a quiet country farmers hostelry and then set out on a tour of exploration. The town of Taunton has the air of a market town and smacks of the soil. The people speak with a soft drawl, the girls have fresh rosy complexions and the little children are the dearest imaginable. The shops seem very clean and prosperous. Walked right through the long main street and soon got out
