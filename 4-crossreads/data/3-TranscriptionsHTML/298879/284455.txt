<p>October 1915<br/>Thursday 21<br/>Windy. Hard work pushing the bike against the wind. There seems to be plenty of despatches to send to different places. Batt. on a route march.   Batt. did a night march also.</p>
<p>Friday 22<br/>Cold, Windy. Route march again culminating in an attack. Pte Dalgleish and myself told off to go as signallers to the Col. and Major Stevens. We had plenty to do, sending, receiving and running with messages.</p>
