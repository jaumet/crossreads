One of them clung to the Australian and only let go when another jumped off &amp; punched the poor beggar.  This exhibition was repeated at Zay a Zig about 50 jumping off &amp; chasing the gippies stealing chocolate, cigarettes oranges etc injuring one of them in the rush.  In our forces there appear to be a fair number who will proceed to any excess, when backed up by a sufficient following to ensure them not getting hurt.  We reached Tel-el-Kebir after four hours of the trucks &amp; where divided up &amp; sent to our various units.  Owing to a reorganisation scheme I was transferred to the 14th Field Ambulance then forming up.  They had taken one section from the 1st &amp; one from the 2nd &amp; formed the new ambulance.  No sooner had I arrived several chaps told me to apply at once for a vacancy as dispenser to B. Section.  This I did as I was told of at least one application</p>
