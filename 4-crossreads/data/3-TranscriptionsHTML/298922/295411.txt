<p><u>El Arish</u></p>
<p>Big guns can be heard firing at Gaza, the big attack takes place today. We are in Reserve standing bye &ndash; doing nothing &amp; enjoying the bathing in the sea.</p>
<p>Last night, one poor trooper went silly or "MAGNOON" as the Arabs say. Walked away with his swag to the Flying Corps &amp; asked for a PLANE to take him to England. They offered him a MARTINSIDE, but he would have nothing but a TAUBE, he said. Poor Beggar is now in the Hospital awaiting train for Cairo mental cases. I hope I don't get it as bad as that!</p>
