Ghezireh Hospital19th Aug. 1915
My dear AuntyI received your card last week was pleased to hear from you, I wrote to you from Heliopolis hope you got my letter, I got over the wound alright & my hand is just as good as ever now,
I am in hospital again it is not a wound this time I got a touch of the Sun out at the camp on the 14th but I am alright now hope to leave tomorrow my temperature was 105 when I was brought out & I was almost unconscious. I seemed to be paralysed I could not move
