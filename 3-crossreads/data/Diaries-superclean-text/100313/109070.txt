24/1/18 Crieff ? Perth Chester
Bade farewell to the Craigs at 10 am and took train for Perth. Today is quite the finest day since my arrival in this part of Scotland and some idea can be gained of what the country is like. Looking from the train there is to be seen a mixture of mountain and wood with many rushing little streams. It is only a short run to Perth a large place with many factories mostly dyeworks. At 11.40 caught the London train. A girl porter came running after me with my pocket book full of money which I had left lying on the seat in the other carriage. A long journey. Changed at Crewe and reached Chester at about 8.45 putting up at the Queen Hotel. The railway stations in England are the devil ? badly lighted and no name board visible. If you ask anyone on the platform what the place is, the answer is usually indistinct owing to dialect.
