 We all have to wear a badge on our arms now with L. D on light duty.  This allows us to smoke and to wander about the grounds.  A party went down from mena to Luna Park to convert it into a hospital for expected wounded.  Satisfactory news comes from the Dardanelles and papers report Austria is suing for peace. 
 Thursday, 15 April, 1915 Time beginning to drag, we are all on light duty in our ward now.  Reports are going about that their has been a big action in the Dardanelles in which the 3rd Brigade Aust. Inf. Fared very badly so far it is not confirmed. 
 Our surgical ward has done fine work here, some great operations have taken place. 
 The base desert hospital is now at Abbassia where the reinforcements are.  This week I have written letters to all my friends in Aust.
