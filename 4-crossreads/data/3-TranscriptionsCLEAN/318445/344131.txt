  
 In this battle every quality that could satisfy the greatest and most critical Commander was demonstrated - resourcefulness, great physical endurance, speed in movement, masterly daring, absolute courage, the resistance of rock , smallness of numbers. and initiative which springs from the intelligence of the troops. Above all, there was success. Was it possible to do more? "The taking of the position"  wrote Sir Douglas Haig, "ranks as a most gallant achievement" . 
 A German corporal of the Russian Guards, who was made prisoner, offered this tribute to his captors: "I never met any men to come up to the Australians for initiative. The French were next, but they lack the dash of the Australians.
