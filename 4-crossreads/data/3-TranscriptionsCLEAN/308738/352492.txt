  
 August 7 Saturday 1915 Working all day feeling much stronger, met Sgt Long & was told that Lieu Robson was killed on 24th Jul.  Poor old "Robbie"the last last words he said to me before leaving,  was  "God bless you my boy"I hope you will soon get well. Little did we think that would be the last handshake on Earth. He was a "true man"so fond of home & wife & little ones. His face shone as he spoke of the happy times of the past & he looked forward to meet those he loved again. I am reminded of the text 
 One shall be taken & the other left. 
 Went to Thos Cooks & Sons got kit bag from Major Fullers valise 
 August 8 Sunday 1915 Went to "Scots Church"both Morning & evening Rev Mackie preached. Morning service 10. 30 AM fairly well attended Text "I saw a New Heaven & Earth " Night service was packed with soldiers & civilians. The singing very hearty, a military choir of men. Text men in biblical history who won the V. C. & D. C. M. very interesting. 
 August 9 Monday 1915 Posted letters to Maude & Harry also Miss Mitchell of the Russell Soldiers Home. Working all day feeling stronger news of severe fighting at the Dardinelles within past few days.
