<p>Monday, 7th December, 1914<br/>Arrived at Alexandria and anchored amongst 5 prize German ships that are being kept in the harbour.  Everywhere is excitement since martial law has been proclaimed the harbour has become very congested.  All sick men have been removed to quarantine camp and we <strike>believe the horses are going into a rest camp before proceeding to Maadi.</strike></p>
<p>Tuesday, 8th December, 1914<br/>Heard we were to disembark and so eager were the men that they all got fully dressed and we even put our bridles on the horses in readiness, but it was a false alarm as we afterwards heard that we may be here for three days.  It was too much for me so a lot of us took French leave over the stern down a rope into a waiting Arab boat.  We went ashore &amp; had a great time, coming back early in the morning some fellows on the Wiltshire were the limit as they climbed up the chain of the anchor thence through the hole a height of over 40 feet.</p>
