<p>Thursday 20 December</p>
<p>Snowy and frozen ground.<br/>Sun shining all day &ndash; Beautiful weather but rather cold.<br/>I took a day off and this afternoon two of us went for a long walk through Cremarest and Bellebrune to La Capelle.  At this place we had a fine meal.  Only French Forestry troops live here &amp; civilians, of course.<br/>Returned through the Boulogne Forest to Wirwignes and hopped straight into bed.</p>
