 SEPT. &nbsp; SATURDAY 9 &nbsp; 1916 
 Fine, but cloudy. Went up to the dentist in morning but he told me to come back on Monday. Went out with the director afterwards. Lay round &amp; wrote in afternoon &amp; went up to the pictures with Warren Hogarth &amp; Bill Hunter in evening.

 Blessed is the man who has found his work&nbsp;&mdash; and then&nbsp;&mdash; gets busy!
