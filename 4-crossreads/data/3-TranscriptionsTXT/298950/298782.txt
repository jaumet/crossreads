Salesman, Acountant & 2 Privates employed in Store room.Postage Post office  At the Comencement the delivery of letters wher very irregular however, as time went on this improved.  Pris wher allowed two letters per week.  Allthough Letters to pris suposed to travel free All my coresponde & others I hawe seen contained allways the usual postage stamp.  I hawe on many ocassiones wrote in my Corespondence, to write on Letters "Service de Prisoneur de Guerre" & same would travel free.  However this message never its destination, being allways "cut out" by Censor.  These of course only applies to letters recieved within the Commonwealth.  The Censorship wher very strict in every sence or form.  The least bit objectionable not & the letter would be returned or destroyed.  If a pris. dared to mention, that the life hier wher not to his liking or anything bad, allthough true of Camp life in General, Letter never wher forwardet.  However if a Pris. wrote "lies" telling of treatement being grant, the Camp being first Class ectra, a Pris. could be shure that letter would be forwardet.
