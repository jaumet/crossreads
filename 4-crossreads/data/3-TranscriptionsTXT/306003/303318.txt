Thurs 13thIt has been a very disagreeable day a strong wind blowing & a little dust with it;  Today is Eric Dowlings 20th birthday & we are celebrating it tonight by having a little feast;  Butter, Dowling McFarlane Cameron, Trickett, Les & myself run a mess between us & live fairly well;
Kamel who professes to be a Christian & was in England studying for a Dr when war broke out, now runs the Canteen here in Camp & is out to make all he can, sugar in the Canteen is 5 PT a lump & only 3 1/2  in the village alongside us; condensed milk is also 5 PT a tin, & Kamel can hold his own now with any of the troopers in a swearing match;
The Colonel had a nasty ride home last night & was in a bad humor when he got there as he ordered Granny out of the Mess & prohibited all gambling & shouting in Officers Mess
