Here's a little sketch of our harbor & the way we be in it  -  It's the crater of a huge volcano - very deep - foreshore & then the side of the circular crater - thin lipped & then the plateau or peaked tops of other volcanoes - wooded to the waters edge & ribbed by pluvial denudation  -  Dense Coco Palm grows on foreshore & a lot of undergrowth  -

Rock in fair way - cross on top said to mark a grave   -  ? Surveyors mark - a trig -
Governor has signed articles of capitulation  -  He is to have a Guard of Honor  -  A Major in charge  -  All his troops here in the island are to march in on Monday as prisoners of war & we hear they are all to go to Sydney till the war is over  -  This takes place I'm told on Monday  -  New Guinea is not yet taken & the Berrima & troops go there   -  Wilhelms Haven  -  We may too  -  This is the big place it seems  -  The Governor cant surrender New Guinea he says - only this island  -  Now that's the news to date  -  All well too on my 3 ships  -
