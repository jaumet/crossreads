<p>4 April, 1916<br/>Moascar<br/>It was an awful messed up morning,  We had  got our kit bags and Tents packed up yesterday  &amp; everything should have gone like clockwork but they fooled us about that way that in stead of moving off at 12.0 it was after 12.30 when we got away.  I was glad to see the last of Serapeum it was a dismal hole, the N.Z. band played us out of camp.  I noticed that a lot of artillery had just arrived there, it seems funny that one lot should move out &amp; another  move in.  We rattled along in great style &amp; nearing Ismalia the way was very pretty; through cultivation &amp; trees.  out side Ismalia there were hundreds of NZ troops in the water bathing, They looked fine.  We got fixed up for the night about dark - Then Joe Woods Harold &amp; I went to the pictures.  It seemed quite a night out</p>
