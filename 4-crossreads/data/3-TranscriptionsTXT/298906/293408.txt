 This afternoon I took a stroll down to Amesbury to get a few little snaps I had 1 film left &amp; I walked into the little church to see if I could do anything inside, finding that it was too dull I came out &amp; who do you think I run into, you will never guess so I will tell you why Bill &amp; Les Clark &amp; a chap named Elliott from the Brown Mountain I think he was, you could have knocked me down with a feather I was that taken back, &amp; so were they, I don't notice any difference in them at all only Les has grown a little bigger moustache, had quite a long yarn with them &amp; with my last film I snapped them I don't know how they will come out for it was very dull &amp; just starting to rain
