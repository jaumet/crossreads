<p>146<br/>is a long way from setting though the drowsy tinkling of the little squares of sheep suggest that is time for repose. Along the river bank flourish the populas with knobby heads picture like, while overhead the lark thrills out his song.</p>
<p>To the left thro dense tree top glimpses can be seen of Wylie &amp; it square church tower &amp; the only blot on this beauteous landscape is the silent &amp; abandoned camp beneath. There is another aspect &amp; that is the economic. There is much waste land here not as [in] France is the ground used to its full advantage.</p>
<p>17-5-19 (Sat)<br/>No new has so far arrived so I decide to finish my leave. Exchange a hat &amp; start off for station &ndash; find that I have just missed the 10.36 &amp; must wait till 1.5. Then arrive at Salisbury &amp; porter takes charge of my gear, &amp; I buy some pc to replace those I lost. Met a NZ &amp; we drink several vermouths the only drinks I have on this leave, arrive in London &amp; find my room kept.</p>
<p>18-5-19 (Sun)<br/>Intended to go to Brighton but do not rise till nearly 3 pm &amp; then not knowing where to go I ask a policeman &amp; he puts me on to Hampton Court As this is [Chestnust] Sunday the day</p>
