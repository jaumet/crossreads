deafening - cant talk - nor can you imagine our Bulgarian hill climbing necessities - The usual rumour-o-grams are passed from mouth to mouth all day - though I generally scatch my pointed beard & wait for confirmation.
Miss the swimming up here but have obtained permission for small morning & afternoon parties to go down & wash & rinse their clothes - often they are covered in blood from gravel & bullet scratches.
I have not heard any tidings of Geof yet. Have not seen the Sicilia again - She was at Hellas Cape you recollect & I suppose ([rations?] on board - We have our own ships coming daily. Most slight wounds & breaks go to Mudros in Lemnos - sick & some wounded to Malta - & bad wounds etc to Alex.
Extraordinarily hard to write a decent letter - & I hope you'll understand - one gets cramped - & every minute a shower of dirt spurts all over the paper from some rotten Turk who has the ridge above me marked & [indecipherable] hits the top every time.
The men's humour is good - the Cairo restaurants are frequently alluded to - Parbury, Keyes & many Scone boys are well - one was hit on the head last night but is quite well.
