<p>Flessells 2/12/16  A delightful sleep in a good French wooden bed with eider down quilt. An airy large room with a sacred picture on one wall and a simple graven crucifix upon another.  White curtains a wardrobe and a look of comfort.  This is a large house built in the usual rectangular manner with offices and out buildings all round the yard and about half an acre of intensely cultivated vegetable garden in rear with lots of glass cucumber frames etc. Monsieur is a Government official of some kind.  The womenfolk are homely and leave their wooden sabots without the door whenever they enter.  The mess is a fine large room with hanging lamp and large oak table and a carved oak dresser in it.  Over everything there is an air of solidity and cleanliness and no striving after outside appearances.  About 10 am went round to look at the billets.  This is a large place about 6000 and the winding old streets are lined with sleepy old houses.  An old chateau is in the centre of our area and it has good grounds.  The entrance to most houses is by a narrow gate which discloses the usual filthy farmyards beyond which is the farm door.  Ice was lying thick over all the ground and we walked out of the village along winding embanked lanes to where there was some open ground.  The view here was very pretty a wood dull grey and bare of leaf bounded the field.  At one corner was an old, old house all gables and corners and behind still was the old village.  The morning was devoted to foot inspection and to the cleaning up of the billets and the afternoon was spent the same way.</p>
