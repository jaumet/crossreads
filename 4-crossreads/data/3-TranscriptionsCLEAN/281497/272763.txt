  
 fine little place with all sorts of shops & trams in her.   There are some very fine buildings including a splendid Cathedral.   The tower shows traces of the fighting which seems to have taken place in & around her at the beginning of the war.   There are five big hot baths here for the troops, & a big building is set apart for the soldiers & it has all conveniences such as restaurants, reading & writing rooms, pianos & such like handy things.
