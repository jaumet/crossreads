<p><u>Battle of Romani Aug 1916</u><br/>3rd &ndash; 13th &ndash; About 125 Turks treated. They were given Dental tent &amp; three or four bell tents for their winged. All thro day of attack &amp; night following spent bullets by hundreds fell in &amp; around tents. Two wounded, hit by them, flesh wounds only. One fell in doorway of same &amp; some passed thro tents. Tipped <strike>somebody</strike> one of us to be hit by them but our luck was in. One of our men, Hollege killed by one &amp; Blyth slight wound in back. Fairly spent. Hollege hit on back of head &amp; killed instantly. Turks had retreated thro night &amp; all rifle fire ceased for a time. About 7 pm, Turks given a table in our tent &amp; <u>carried on.</u> Rather unique spectacle. We (Austns) treating ours on one table &amp; Turks treating theirs on another table in same tent. Would like to have got a photo but too busy. Turks had retired on Qatia &amp; our L.H &amp; NZs kept in touch. On afternoon of 5th our men charged Turks at Qatia &amp; got within 600 yards but they were too strong &amp; their M.G. fire mowed our men NZ. M.O (Wellingtons) &amp; his Sgt caught by M.G. fire &amp; badly wounded. M.O. died &amp; his sgt to this date (13th) not expected to live. M.O. had compnd, complicated, comminuted fractures of both legs &amp; shock. His foot also badly knocked about below ankle, by piece out of left calf &amp; several M.G. furrows thro buttock. Despite these injuries, poor beggar had to ride from Qatia (6 miles) on horseback. Marvellous pluck &amp; endurance. Several other cases of men with broken thighs riding back. For absolute pluck &amp; endurance I never saw or heard of anything like it before</p>
