<p>Tuesday, 29 June, 1915<br/>The American Cruiser "Tenessee" [Tennessee] is in again, &amp; some of her crew got themselves into another row by public drinking the Kaiser's health &amp; showing the Union Jack in the presence of some Austs with the result that one of the neutrals was killed and seven injured.  I went out to Ramleh to the transport to-day and spent an enjoyable time surfing in the breakers.  The camp has improved and they are having a good time but a bit monotonous.  As all my mates are there and I am sick of messing about on hospital ships, I am trying to get a transfer to there unless we do something definite.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 30 June, 1915<br/>I was refused my transfer by the Col, that is another I have against him when the XXXX comes.  The Saldanha, Galinha &amp; Dunbar Castle have all been converted into hospital ships and painted, we are anxiously awaiting our next move, we just missed a trip to England this boat eventually is going to be converted to, we will be sorry to leave her as the crew are fine fellows and we are living second class saloon, the food &amp; comfort of the cabins is a contrast to the Galenha.</p>
