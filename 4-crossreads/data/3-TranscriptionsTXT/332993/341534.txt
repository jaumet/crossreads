Friday July 13, 1917 (1075).A fine warm day.There was a lot of aerial activity last night & early this morning by enemy planes flying over our billets. The anti aircraft guns were belching away late last night & early this morning.I was 2 picquet last night of watch.The Transport drivers had a rough time last night & the night before taking rations to the trenches  They saw a motor lorry driver lying killed alongside the road. Numerous shells were about. I was on picquet tonight 6 to 9, first picquet.There is good news of another Russian Victory of 10,000 prisoners & a large number of guns making a total of 28,000 since July 1. The British have suffered a reverse in Belgium near the Sea.
Saturday July 14, 1917 (1076).A very sultery day.In 20 days more the war will have been running 3 years the estimated duration attributed to the late Lord Kitchener, who by the way is believed by some people in England to be still alive.Early this morning Fritz's planes came over our billets and dropped bombs, the explosions from which wakened most in camp. Our archies opened fire & our planes attacked them, but they escaped. It is rumoured that another spy in the air service, or rather traitor has been spotted.The big political crisis in Germany is not yet over. The Russians continue their succession of Victories.We were issued with cigarettes & matches this afternoon, also a pair of comfort fund socks.I finished reading "Evelyn Hastings by Victoria Cross. A Mystic story with a strong religious strain of simple piety and strong belief in the efficiency of prayer
