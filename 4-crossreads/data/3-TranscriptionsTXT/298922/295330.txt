 [This paragraph crossed through.]  Dorothy does not sing or play but she can SKATE, DANCE, &amp; play HOCKEY, eat, never sick, &amp; is as strong as a horse quite ready to come into the Bush with me, she is not too happy at home I am afraid Father &amp; Mother don't get on well together. Of course she will love you little Mother &amp; it will be a great day when I come home!!!  Just wrote some letters. 
 It is still cold wet &amp; raining. 2 Scotchmen dug themselves a Bivy in the sand and last night it fell in &amp; smothered one, the other is in Hospital. We expect to go on a stunt tonight again &ndash; it will be cold, but no mud &amp; am very fit &amp; well. 
 Jim is thin but well - &amp; we talked HAY till late.
