 My dear Arthur, Kindly accept my sincere congratulations on new appointment which I hope & believe is better than the old post. The surprise occasioned when the G.P.O. list was issued, [indecipherable] case, was a disappointment by the omission of your name but such has now been overcome by the pleasing information in this morning's paper. 
 Old associations, which were always of a very pleasant character, call to my mind the many pleasurable & instructive meetings of our old Society & arouse within me a feeling akin to joy when I note the success of any of those who found such association. 
 So far a great many of the Old Redfern Literary Society boys have done well & I certainly hope that good old Steve Mullondey will reap the same reward 
 Yours truly [indecipherable] A Williamson
