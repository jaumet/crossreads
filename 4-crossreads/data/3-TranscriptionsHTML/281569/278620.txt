Mel &amp; the boss had in the meantime met a car coming in from the Waddy &amp; they got each a bottleful of juice &amp; the Boss thought they had enough to bring them home, they then set out at 5.15 for here everything went OK for a couple of miles then the Boss did his nut &amp; shot out of the desert, by this time it was pitch dark &amp; none of the lamps burning. Mel kept straight</p>
