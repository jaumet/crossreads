 Squar , it an expens place but great to stop at , I alway give all these club etc for soldier a wide berth when on leav , I like someth a littl more tasti than those , we went saw " Go Up " Fair " Warmer " " Box o Trick " the Naughti Wife " while in London this time , I like the former veri much , we had a jolli good time I was sorri when his time was up he had to go back to Camp , it rotten knock about without a mate , one night I saw an aw sight we were have dinner in the Corner Hous at the tabl next to us was a ladi entertain 4 blind soldier , it seem aw to me for that is my one fear I know if ever I lose my sight I shall do away with myself for life would be no good to me
