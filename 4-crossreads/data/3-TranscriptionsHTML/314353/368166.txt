<p>Oct. 5<br/>26.<br/>Rumour runs riot, now it's of Marks, Dick Seymour and another missing.  The 7 wounded and two killed, changes, and no real word of them seems known either at Menin Road or Westhoek, they are of the newly joined 25 reinforcements &ndash; new men from Australia.</p>
<p>Mail today brought a letter from the Australian Red Cross enquiring &ndash; from the Secretary Vera Deakin, after the manner of death and burial of Rusty Leask, killed at the Embankment by Bullecourt.  The letter envelope addressed F.H. Molony spelt correctly.  Who gave my address, surely not young Marly wounded by the same shell, though he could have been the only one.  At Pozieres I wrote a letter of sympathy to his mother, and found from the O.R. his Mother was dead.  Answered the letter, but cannot post it till we're out.  Also letter from Mat.</p>
<p>The Y.M.C.A. have been comfort stalling at Menin Road and in Ypres, and have been doing it well, cigarettes, cocoa, Biscuits and chocolate all in plenty.</p>
<p>Shelling today in Ypres got a number of Tommies and parties.  Striking the road cobbles adds terror and double terror to the shells bursting.</p>
<p>Such a shell got our bearers on the 18 Sept.</p>
<p>The day cold, windy, but the sun shining, and blue skies between great white and grey clouds.  Air planes over the last two days well in charge, but today &ndash; this afternoon a squadron of taubes over.  To Night?  !!</p>
<p>Today posted, green envelopes, letters to Mother, Billy and Grandma.</p>
<p>Dinner today Spotty cooked us steak and onions, the last time I tasted steak and onions was in supports by Luisenhof Farm with George &ndash; Capt. in the 18th.</p>
<p>27.  October 6<br/>Back from Menin Road and the Ypres Station.</p>
<p>The entry that ends Oct. 4, 2 killed and 7 wounded.  These were new reinforcements, newly joined from the Base.  Another added to their number of killed, Jack Marks and Dick Seymour, now reported killed.</p>
<p>The squad was Jack, Dick, Mac and a new man.</p>
