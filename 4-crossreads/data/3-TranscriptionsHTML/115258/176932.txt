<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I have three letters from you to answer which came by the last two mails and were waiting for me here when I got back from Port Said - where I wrote to you three times three days running. I will answer your letters now before going on with any other news Mother. That letter of George Coates you sent seems wonderful for a blind chap does it not. He must have been a very capable chap before to be able to carry on so splendidly now. Yes Mother I think I still have that kit bag Aunt Fan made me. It is in the kit store at Hhezera near Cairo. Only men in base jobs can go in for the luxury of uxing them over here. The longer a person soldiers on the less he seems to need. In summer here you have a bit of geer to carry but in winter</p>
