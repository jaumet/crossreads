 Pass Cape Otway about dinner time the countri behind look to be well wood , but the foreshor is sandi color , we skirt the Victorian coast all the afternoon heavi bushfir appear to be rage along most of the coast , a thick mist hung over all , short after tea we enter the head , there has been much specul as to whether we will go into quarantin or not We will soon know now what do , the pilot has just come aboard we are slowli go up the Bay , it too dark unfortun to see anyth save the glimmer of the lighthous , the sunset tonight was a dinkum " Aussi " one bright red the first one of it kind for over 4 year , most of the lad are high excit so far I have not gone or done
