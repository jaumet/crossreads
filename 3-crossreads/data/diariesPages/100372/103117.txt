Nov 1916
trouble here, waiting re-equipping etc & at 9.30 left for train, travelling in usual military fashion, goods trucks failing cattle trucks. Very cold, no blankets & not sufficient room to stretch our legs out. However we are accustomed to this & not at all surprised at it, in fact we anticipated it. However about 4.30 before daylight we got to Suez & spent the next hour being shunted up & down one or two sidings & about daylight we pulled up near the pier The "port Darwin" one of the C’wealth steamers of about 8,000 tons. About 200-300 inf from France also waiting. Report vary saying 800-1200 aboard. Dave aboard too, also many old faces that I have not seen for years. Nearly all 1914 men & a very fine class too. Very different to those met in brigades. Quite safe to leave
