Villers-Brettoneux 
28th Bn came in to our relief and at 10.30 pm in company with our Yank comrades we set off for the front line trenches. Just before we left the enemy put a few shells around just for luck. It was pitch dark as we set out on our walk up through the village ? the notorious village ? of Villers Bretonneux. Gun flash and crash, the sickly light of flares and all round devastation. Machine guns were active but none came near us. We started to pass men moving in all ways as the 21st as well as ourselves were on the move. We trudged through slushy mud ? the result of the rain today. On a stretcher was laid an American with a hole in his head and another wounded man laid alongside also ? cracked by a shell.
