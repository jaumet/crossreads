 Many a time &amp; oft has my body accomplished a more physically difficult task, than to climb the four hundred and fifty one feet of the pyramid.  But standing on its summit my brain cells and immagination had more rein than at former period of my life.  This the result of the congenial tasks, which geography and travel records, have, during more than fifty years, been my portion. 
 Abdul the Active, with his English words in Oxfordian drawl, skipped down before us saying, &ndash; "I can go down in seven  seconds  minutes" &ndash;, Taylor followed, &amp; I came after.  No need for rest on the descent.  The weight of the body threw no extra work on the heart, foot after foot  with ease  reaching from stone to stone with ease. 
 Can a lady climb the Pyramid?  Without trouble, if her skirts be not too tight and a guide assists on either hand.  You might find the descent more inconvenient than the ascent, not so were you wearing a knickerbocker suit. 
 Please send this account to the girls in Macquarie Street as I have used up a little time in constructing it, they will like to read it mayhap to show it to some of their friends. 
 About 9 p.m.  I fell asleep on the sofa, woke at 1-15 a.m., walked to the hospital, chatted with Sister Johnson [Head Sister Julia Bligh Johnston], had tea &amp; cakes, came here, wrote to you, and must now 3-40 a.m. to bed, because I have an operation at 8 a.m. 
 Six operations kept me busy during the morning of the 3rd inst., the moments are now of the 4th Febry, Thursday, your photograph as a Dominican is in my hand, while Ruskin has written &ndash; "Men say their pinnacles point to heaven.  Why, so does every tree that buds, and every bird that rises as it sings."  Good night?  [A row of Xs and Os.]
