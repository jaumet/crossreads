<p>[Transcriber's notes:<br/>Letters written from Egypt and Gallipoli.  Butler had risen from being a private in the Australian Light Horse to a 2nd Lieut pilot. In his last letter he describes various exploits such as accidents, rescues, treatment of captured pilots by the Germans. It is a good description of the lives of pilots in WW1.]</p>
