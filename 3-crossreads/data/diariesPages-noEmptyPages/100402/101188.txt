Wednesday 25 December
Xmas day passed quietly. We had much to eat a little to drink, but everything was very orderly. As a matter of act, I have a touch of flu.
Thursday 26 December
Joy! A return has been asked of all men who left Australia in 1915 C.O.'s have been warned to be prepared to lose these men at any moment. Admitted to Rest Station with flu.
