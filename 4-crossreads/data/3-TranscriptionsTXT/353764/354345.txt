Sunday 28/11/15We are now far out at Sea on our long voyage.  The weather is very good & the Sea smooth.  The "Ceramic" caught us up to-day & is now ahead of us, while some more are behind.  We got through the "Leuwin" well & are looking for a good trip from now on.Church Service was held to-day & conducted by the Captain of the Ship.  It was very impressive being attended by about 900 men.The Band Played Sacred music & we all sang Hymns which were beautiful.The weather is getting very hot, & I believe we will be in the Tropics in a few days time, so that coupled with our trip across the Indian Ocean will make us very uncomfortable, but it will be acclimatizing us for what we will get in Egypt.
Monday 29.11.15We are now 1000 miles in the Indian Ocean, but have still 5000 to go.  The weather still continues to get hotter & to this end all Decks are having awnings of Canvas put over them.
