July 19172nd   This morning we went down to the canal & put things in order for starting this afternoon.   A bridge has been put across the "lagoon" also a large landing stage & a sort of a "Grandstand" made of the pontoons, which already presents an interesting aspect.At 3 P.M. a preliminary start was made with the sports by the rowing.   The course of 800 yards has been marked out on the canal, & the 8th Coy won a victory over the 14th Field Co. in the 10 oar "galley" race.   With the four oar crew, ( I myself as cockswain) we scored a victory over the 8th by about 4 inches, & the 14th beat the H.Q. Crew by a length.
