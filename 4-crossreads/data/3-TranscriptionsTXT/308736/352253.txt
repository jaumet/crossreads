The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and MeWhen we are absent and the World seems drearThough many miles may part us, land or seaHis arms enfolding us, will draw us near.
The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and MeWe miss each other so, He knows it wellAnd, in His love, will make our love to beOur joy and stay wherever we may dwell.
The Lord watch over us, Dear, Thee and Me,And guard and shield us both from harm & painAnd grant that soon together we may beTogether, nevermore to part again.
