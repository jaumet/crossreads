<p><u>April 1919</u></p>
<p>has had, it was a wonder that it ever turned up at all.</p>
<p>April 5th<br/>The weather for the past week has been nice and sunny, The mornings were a little frosty but otherwise it has been all that could be wished for.</p>
<p>Sunday April the 6th I went for a walk to Heytesbury Village which is about three miles distant from this hospital, I went on purpose to see a chap who was in Germany with me. It was rather a long walk for my first time since arrival in hospital, The walk was beautiful and no doubt will do me a lot of good, I arrived home very tired.</p>
<p>The village of Heytesbury is the same as most English villages, a cluster of cottages, two or three streets, a Hotel and a well &amp; pump comprise the place</p>
