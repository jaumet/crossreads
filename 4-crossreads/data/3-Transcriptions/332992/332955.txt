<p>There was a good deal of aerial activity to day.</p>
<p>Tuesday May 15.1917<br/>A cool cloudy day.  I was in Armentieres this morning helping to load coal.  As no vehicles are allowed over the Bridge at Pont de Nieppe, we had to come back by another route through [indecipherable].  A L'Epinette pass by our transports billet and by the Nieppe railway station  to our store.<br/>A Battalion of New Zealanders camped to day in a paddock along side of us.  There are 7 fine milking cows out in a little grass paddock near by.  It is the first time that I have seen them out of their stalls.<br/>I wrote an article on France for one of the men in the Transports last night &amp; will finish it to day.<br/>[Shorthand entry not transcribed] Hambrook.</p>
