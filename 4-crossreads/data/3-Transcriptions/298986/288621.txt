<p>talk before the train left.  At Shotley the wether was not the best but went for a walk every day to no where in particular except on Sunday Mab &amp; I went about 4 miles to a farm for tea just the sort of place one reads about a nice house plenty to eat nicely served &amp; fresh &amp; none of the hard commercial spirit.  Mab was just the same as ever &amp; being there does not make camp life any</p>
