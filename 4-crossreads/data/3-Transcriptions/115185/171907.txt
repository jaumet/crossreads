<p>15 &ndash; enteric fever in Alexandria a short time ago and has been very depressed. Then I came on duty &ndash; Sister Dowe accompanies me on my tramps about the hospital. She is very good to me &ndash; always seeing that I get enough food etc &ndash; and doing little things for me. I am very grateful to her for all her sweetness. That is my day and here I am on duty writing to you all. My patients are all asleep. Soldiers sleep well even when ill. Being so glad to be in a bed between sheets with the comfort &amp; care , they just snuggle down between the clothes - &amp; sleep &amp; sleep. I wish you all a very happy Christmas. A peaceful one I wish it could be. I hope the next will see us all together again &ndash; those who are left of us &ndash; none of us know who are out in this awful place what is in store for us &ndash; But I shall always feel the tremendous honour and priviledge it has been for any who are able to be allowed to do the work that we are doing here and share in a slight way the hardships of our brave soldiers &ndash; till I write again</p>
