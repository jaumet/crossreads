  
 116 today one to Holmes & the other to Bowden 
 I strike duty to night in charge of a picket which after searching for town major find that the duties are nil. My orderly has not yet succeeded in finding me though he is here somewhere. The billet is apparently the relic of a rather fine household with garage. The rooms all run one into the other & are not too springy beds. [A small sketch inserted here]. 
 14-4-19 (Mon) This morning we had a route march The company (150) is also a battalion MacKenzie & myself are all the officers We go to top of hill in a biting cold wind but rain comes on & we return Rain continues all day. 
 Doc returns & I arrange his transport. His leave has come through & he is bound for a job in blighty. 
 Afternoon is rainy but this suits me as my diary is away in arrears. 
 15-4-19 (Tues) Rain - no parade - wet night at camp on hill to night as draft leaves to morrow -
