Gray.&nbsp; Gave three cheers to O.C. Troops and Captain Jermyn of the &quot;Marathon.&quot;&nbsp; Also our own officers.&nbsp; Formed many mental pictures of the folks at home, wondering what part of the world it was in which we were facing grimly the sinister intentions of Hun and Company.&nbsp; H.M.S. Swiftsure arrived this afternoon.&nbsp; She was saluted by our transport in the usual manner and custom according to tradition.&nbsp; The ship&#39;s ensign was dipped aft and all the men on deck stood to the salute, as the trumpeter on the Swiftsure blew the call.&nbsp; The ceremony was very impressive and once again drove home to our minds the beauty and severity of the tradition and discipline in the good old British Navy.&nbsp; H.M. King George&#39;s message of Xmas Greetings was read the troops this morning at Church Parade.&nbsp; Gave him three hearty cheers for his thoughts.&nbsp; Afternoon&nbsp; Lay on deck and had a sleep.&nbsp; Evening.&nbsp; Sang Comrades in Arms with Quartette at Sacred Concert which was held on deck.</td>
