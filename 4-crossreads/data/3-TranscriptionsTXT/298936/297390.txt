 Wednesday 4 
 Fairly  busy  day. 
 More trouble with Hunter &amp; Flint. 
 Hunter is a  dammed  lazy scamp. 
 Still on good terms with Colonel &amp; hope it keeps up for he can do me some good. 
 Patients doing very well &amp; if they get no worse I am in for a good time. 
 Have no time to write letters yet however must shake it up now, for we may call at Fremantle &amp; Rita must have a line from me.
