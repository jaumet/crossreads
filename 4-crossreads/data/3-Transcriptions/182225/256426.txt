<p>1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 3 &nbsp; NOV.</p>
<p>Raining all day. We had a mounted battery drill in morning &amp; I was lead driver on the Firing battery waggon. It was a bit of a farce &amp; we were fooled about as usual in stables &amp; harness room afterwards. The battery went on duty at night. I asked Campbell about a transfer to the R.F.C &amp; he said he would fix me up all right.</p>
