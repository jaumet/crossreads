Colours.  Bands of shining youths paraded the streets, plentifully bedecked with the rosette & tricolour ribbon,  Their enthusiasm was gold good to behold  They chanted the 'Marseillaise' & other martial melodies: A band of these youths surged into the Estaminet where we were indulging in a "Wee "Doch & Dorrick'" - Singing all they the time, they linked hands & danced around us "Tres Bon Australie"
