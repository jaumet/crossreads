 Saturday 18 September, 1915 
 Carried water. Four of us built a shelter for one of the gun numbers. I had a pretty rotten job emptying sandbags over the side of a steep hill in full view of the enemies trenches, was sniped at but they were rotten shots & couldn't get within a foot of me. Anyhow the officer made me get down. 
 The Turks opened a furious artillery & rifle fire at 5.15 & lasting for 20 minutes. The air seemed alive with bullets & the concussion almost made one sick. They got one of our poor chaps through the head & another was hit by a shell. 
 I have to go on watch at 6 p.m., one of the men has just gone sick. 
 The Turks made a big attack on the left but were beaten back with heavy loss, that was the reason of the demonstration against this post.
