missed a single hop over that our Battn has been in since she was formed. Bad weather for aeroplanes so there were none over last night.
4th Dull heavy this morning, looks very much like rain, hope it keeps off. Just as we were going to the range this morning an order came down that all ranks were to stand fast be ready to move at half an hours notice to the firing line, I don't think somehow our chaps have gone over for the weather is too dull for observation purposes this means a lot.
Have just heard that the boys hopped over last night succeeded in carrying all their objectives, good going, we are now expecting to move at any minute are all packed up in readiness, most of the other troops are moving up. 
All sorts of rumours are flying round as is usual after successful stunts, but I am quite used to them by this time. A fair number of men are going on leave wish I had half their luck
