<p>The General (Brig General J Gellibrand 6th Bde) was present and three Colonels.  I presided and we passed a very pleasant evening in song and talk and devious tracks led homewards.  A feature of this life is "dopiness" very often men who might be regarded as among our smartest suddenly lose all their dash and become very dirty in appearance and sluggish in mind.  In Egypt vice perhaps proved a drain on some mens' mentality.  Here it seems to be chiefly due to staleness and monotony.  In N.C.O's this "dopiness" generally leads to C.M.'s and reversion to the ranks.  Colonel Smith reported back as the Brigadier has returned.  The latter looks very far from well and prevailing opinion gives him about a fortnight with us here.  Some good talent came out at our dinner &ndash; Evans sings Welsh songs and [indecipherable]Slater tells good stories.  Our little French Brigade interpreter brought the house down with some neat repartee.  Bed 11 pm.</p>
