 June 16 1917 Saturday At 2 am Coffee & biscuits were turned on & soon afterwards we turned out the roll called & we were of on the old trip Liverpool to Sydney - How long before any of us would take that trip again. 
 We lined up at Sydney as the day broke for the march to the boat but it was not a success from a Military point of view. There was a big crowed to see us off mostly girlies & of course we were all mixed up. There was no delay at the Barier & by 7 AM we were all aboard the trooper A72 (Beltana)
