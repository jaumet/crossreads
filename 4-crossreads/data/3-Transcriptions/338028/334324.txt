<p>Thursday 1st June<br/>Early this morning a Taube flew over the 1st L H Bde lines to avenge yesterdays defeat. He dropped eight bombs killing 5 men wounding 13 as well as 30 horses killed of the 3rd Regs, all the casualties were in the 3rd. The first's horses stampeded when the bombs dropped in their lines killing a few and the others bolted in the desert.</p>
<p>We got five over our camp. We expect to be bombed to-night. Packed up and all ready for [indescribable] in the a.m.</p>
<p>Friday 2nd June<br/>Transport came at 4 a.m. and packed all my stuff on it in charge of my two men who unloaded it at the railway siding Gilban. We did not go until the kilted Scotties H.L.I. relieved us then we also went. I rode a camel to the siding where all our goods were loaded on to the light train, arrived at Kantoom at dusk where the 1st L H Bde Transport took our goods about three miles along the canal out to some desert a stiff pull for the mules.</p>
<p>Our goods were just dumped on the desert and each man turned in for they all had to go to Tel-el-Kebir at 3 am for the horses. The Dr took one man and I am left in charge to do the M O and sanitation work.</p>
<p>Saturday 3rd June<br/>Main body left at 3.30 am and when the remainder fell in we immediately pegged out the camp and I did the sanitation.</p>
