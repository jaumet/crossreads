 Turk do not travel veri often at night but when they do they alway sing as it is suppos to keep away evil spirit ) . So we decid to hide in the bush until this person pass . We did not have long to wait for a Turk rode by on a hors . When he had got well clear we came out to the well and lower our water bottl down on a string . The water was quit good and we had a good fill up . We had been without water sinc the morn and it was terribl hot . After half an hour rest we move off again . The travel was terribl difficult . When we got to the top of the next hill about 2 a.m. we felt so absolut done up , we lay down to sleep. When day broke we found ourselv on the top of a hill veri much like the one of the previous day and we could still see the old castl so we could see that we had realli made veri littl progress in a direct line . We spent the day in the shade sleep as best we could . About sunset we move off again . It is not such bad travel as the previous night Befor we got to the bottom of the hill we pass veri close to an old Turk Farmer . He did not take the slightest notic of us . After about two mile travel we came to an old well a welcom sight on examin we could see just a littl water in the bottom . We lower our water bottl down . On examin the water it was found to be veri dirti and full of white maggot , so we decid to fill our bottl up and keep it in case we should not find ani more . After we left the well we came on to a track . We decid to follow this track and chanc meet anybodi . After we had travel a mile or two the track turn off our cours so we had to leav it . After this we had some veri rough travel through thick prick bush . After midnight we came onto a clear patch of ground just up from a valley . Just as we got out of the bush two dog rush at us make a great nois and about 100 yard away we could see a black tent . We knew this to be a shepherd tent so we got back into the bush as soon as poissibl . We lay there veri quiet for about half an hour . Dure this time we heard cattl make a nois down in the valley just below us so we knew there must be water somewher near . After pick our way veri cautious we got down into the valley and there we found a small spring . We immedi threw away the bad water we got from the well . After half an hour 's rest we move off again , follow a narrow track . Short after this we came out on to more open countri . At one place we came onto a small patch of clear ground . Two jackal jump up just in front of us and ran away and just on our right we were alarm to hear a fierv growl . On look in the direct we could make out a larg black object about 50 yard away and close to the bush make it way slowli along in one oppositet direct to which we were go ( it was about a half moon but veri cloudi ) we were carri a larg stick each so we kept our eye on this anim till we got well clear and then made off as fast as we could .
