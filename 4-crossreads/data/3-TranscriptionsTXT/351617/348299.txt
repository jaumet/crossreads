Nobody slept at all that night & the row of the singing was something awful but who cared, we were only to pleased to get away from that Land of Sand, Sun, & Sorrow, to where people spoke our own language.
Next morning we were up bright & early, & packed all our kit bags, cleaned our equipment, & got everything ready for our Journey. Breakfast was over at 4 am & then we set too to pull down all our tents, roll them up & clean up anything else in the way of rubbish, for although this was only a desert it had to be left just as it was in the first place.
About 3 pm we had finished and were just about tired out so we went down to where our equipment was stacked & made ready to move off. This was 3 pm
