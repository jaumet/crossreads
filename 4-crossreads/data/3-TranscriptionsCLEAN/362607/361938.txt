Dear Dad, Mum &  George,
I will just be able to get this card posted in time for the mail. Ellis, Dave  Niness &  I are packing up for a week at Alexandria. We are having cooler weather now. 1/6 a day is a strain in this Clime. We have a terrible job to make it last. I will have to cable for some from England because I want to see the sights. I still have                         5 & Ellis has too, but with a trip to Grimsby 30/ & one to the Island 50/- we will be nearly out on the rocks. We are both well & have not been sick since we left Sydney. It is all the hours we put in sleep that have kept us so well. I must go now. I am going to do 3 General to see Dolly Hale to-night. Hends visiting up here last Tuesday. Love From Billy, Dave, Harry & Ellis
