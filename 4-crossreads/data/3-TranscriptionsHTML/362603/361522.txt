<p>Red Cross letterhead<br/>14.9.17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>Your letters of the 1st &amp; 8th July to hand.  Ellis has gone to see the "Merry Widow" played &amp; I'm trying to get some letters written.<br/>So You managed to get up to Old Burwood again.  Do you mind the time that you walked &amp; Ellis &amp; I rode our Bikes down to Mortlake.<br/>How are You going to get the Pony Home.  George aught to go down.  He could trot it Home all the way.  You'll have a talk methinks.  It is sure to be a little frisky.<br/>I do Hope Eric Merrett looks us up.  We are right glad to meet any one of our old Pals.<br/>So Adam Ogilvy has at last become Mayor.  Did Mr Keirle retire?  Is he still a Councillor?</p>
