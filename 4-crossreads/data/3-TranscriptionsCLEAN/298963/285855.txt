wear ought but crape.  Went into one [indecipherable] restaurant - the one we have always patronised because it is clean - but today what sounds greeted our ears - the little girl - an only child is crying for daddy while the wife is too full for words.  We asked the reason & learnt it from her sobs, "daddy is dead" gone to that venue whence no traveller returns.  He like others have given all for those he loved but enough of this, thousands are today bereft of someone who is just as dear.  We went into the art gallery (Picardy).  It is closed now but by going to the French Military Office Australians are allowed in.
