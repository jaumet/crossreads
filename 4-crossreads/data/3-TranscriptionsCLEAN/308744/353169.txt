 Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on the work of No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps, with a view to its being forwarded to G.O.C., A.I.F for record in the documents of that Squadron. 
 On assuming command of the 5th Wing, R.F.C., in Sinai in January 1917, my command consisted of No. 1 Squadron, A.F.C., then known as No. 67 Australian Squadron, R.F.C. and two Flights of No. 14 Squadron R.F.C. The Australian Squadron was equipped with B.E 2.C and Martinayde and carried out all the various forms of aerial work, reconnaissance, photography bombing and artillery co-operation. 
 This combination of the various duties in one unit entailed such addition[al]  strain on all concerned, but these duties were invariably carried out with the greatest gallantry, and initiative by pilots and observers concerned and great devotion to duty and high technical skill on the part of other ranks. 
 During the first operations of GAZA on 25th to 28th March 1917, owing to a series of casualties and other causes, practically the whole of the aerial work during the operations devolved on the Australian Squadron, and it was only due to the devotion of all concerned in keeping the maximum proportion of machines serviceable and the untiring determination of all Officers, combined with the finest leadership that made possible the results achieved. It is sufficient to mention that on three days during these operations 591/2, 64 and 42 hours flying was done respectively by the Squadron. 
 Similarly during the second operations on GAZA on 17th and 19th April, owing to the large number of calls for aerial work the Squadron was called on to work at abnormally high pressure: the results achieved again formed the most satisfactory testimony to the efficiency of the unit. 
 It must be borne in mind' that not only during the period of active operations there was a heavy strain on the unit, but even during a lull in the operations on the ground, aerial operations of reconnaissance, bombing etc. were incessant, and for seven months in the summer flying was possible on practically every day. The strain of this, coupled with the heat and the fact that at this time units were equipped with machines inferior in climb and speed to those of the enemy, was very great, but throughout the six months elapsing between the second operations of GAZA and the operations commencing on October 27th the Squadron maintained a very remarkably high state of efficiency. 
 The gallantry and resource of pilots and observers when carrying out long and dangerous flights under most difficult conditions, the high technical skill and energy of every branch of the Squadron, and the devotion of wireless operators of the Squadron attached to Batteries, was worthy of the very highest praise. 
 This high standard has been maintained with remarkable consistency and the advent of more up to date machines and the expansion of the R.F.C., making specialisation possible, has given the Squadron an opportunity of achieving even more valuable results. 
 It is unnecessary to mention details, but some idea of the work of the Squadron may be gathered from the fact that, during the successful advance of the Forces in Palestine after the battle of GAZA which commenced on October 26th., the Squadron maintained throughout the month of November a daily average of 29 hours service flying, a record which has in probability not been equalled on any front with the same numbe[r] of available
