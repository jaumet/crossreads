<p>June 1917<br/>13th   To-day I plotted out the new trenches on the map &amp; made out a report on them for the C.R.E.   The remainder of the section went out to the trenches near Biefuillers to put up an extra entanglement in in front of one of Fritzs old trenches in order to make it defensible.<br/>14th   The company were engaged on pontoon instruction all the morning, &amp; had the afternoon off.   The 14th Field Coy. played our company rugby after tea on a paddock at the back of our billet, in which the 14th won by a try.   That makes them 1 point ahead of us for the sports "Cup."</p>
