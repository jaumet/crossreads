26/1/19 Gourdinne
A day of snow. It was falling gently in very light feathery flakes just about breakfast time and roads and rooves were snow white with it. All the morning it steadily continued until after midday. As it had cleared then I went for a walk with Pat Gorman to Somzee and down to the outskirts of Laneffe. Round here were many houses which had been burnt in 1914 by the Huns apparently for no good reason. We walked back overland. People's faces look peculiar on a snowy day. Against the white background they seem as yellow as Chinese. A great crowd of officers to lunch today. Abercrombie some others were unusaully conversational at mess. Had supper with Madame Mselle and enjoyed much badinage.
