Inspected by the King
Altho' the parade has finished the march past at 4 p.m. it was near 7 p.m. before we got back to Camp.  The whole thing went off smoothly.
Wednesday 27thReceived letter from bro. Ernie.To day was "the day" of days.  We pushed off from our Camp early en route for Bulford Fields where we arrived in good time being arrayed in our best.  His Majesty arrived at about 11 a.m. and the massed bands (12) struck up "God Save the King".  Besides the 3rd Division there were the whole of Reinforcements for other Divisions & some Light Horse.  Wounded Anzacs looked on.After the inspection followed the "march past" which was excellent - all arms being more than satisfied by their shewing.  The King then drove rode away amid thunderous cheers by the huge numbers present.  Then the rained poured down & we looked like drowned rats but still full of humor.  A shower on return soon put us right but left our togs pretty wet.
Thursday 28thWe were allowed the morning off to dry clothes, clean our huts etc. and was acceptable.  It gave me a chance at same time to complete my Australian mail which closes today.Afternoon route march.
Friday 29thIt was very noticeable that when we paraded at 6.30 it was almost too dark to see our own men & impossible to see any officers on Parade.
