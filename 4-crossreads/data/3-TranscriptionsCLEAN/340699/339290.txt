The view I spoke of is a beauty - a lovely valley full of historic villages now devoid of human being, beuaitful in colour and form; you would love to see it. I hope to make a most exhaustive drawing of the scene and a smaller color scheme sketch. From the drawing I'll then paint, depending for the color, on the small cnavas.
