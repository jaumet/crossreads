and it appears now that it really comes from officers as men are not allowed in Shepherds. Went to usual Church parade again this morning. Wrote letter home and saw Russ and Bruce. Studied French all afternoon. Bob Prior was round for a while this evening. Lt. Prior is now Capt. He is altogether too young in my opinion only 22 and not particularly smart either. Sports on Tuesday.

Had our usual buzzer parades from 6.30 to 10.30 am and 4 pm-6 pm. Mr Prior announced that we have marching orders for Wednesday. I wonder. The Austrians are making wonderful progress on their fronts lately. Packed my saddle away this afternoon preparatory to moving off. Went for a swim to-night. We have beautiful moonlight nights and it is perfect in the water

Fearful day. Dust and sand blowing about We had a V.D. inspection today and are going to a Memorial Service for Earl Kitchener at 5.30 pm. We handed our spare blankets and helmets in this morning. The Sports have been postponed until tomorrow morning. Am still learning French assiduously.

Sergeant McMullen told me today that I was very foolish to join the Staff and should have been on the gun instead as I would have had a much better chance. Saw Russ and Edric and also Bruce Elliott tonight and said good-bye to them
