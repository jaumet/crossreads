  
 Saturday 20 April 1917 [1918] At last a swab is taken of my throat and soon I may be allowed up.  More papers from Q'land & Mother.  A very quiet peaceful Saturday as the days all are when I take enough thought & keep from worrying.  At 6 p.m. Miss Warrall brings a friend, Miss Berry, (B'bane) 31 G.H. to see me, a pleasant girl & nice expression. From my window I watch the daily toil of the Egyptians in the fields lying just in front of Choubra & very picturesque it all is, waving barley or rice just coming into ear, patches of Lucerne now being cut, then a patch of the chocolate brown earth already showing a tinge of green.  Here the family works early & late, driving a mule or donkey, weeding or digging.
