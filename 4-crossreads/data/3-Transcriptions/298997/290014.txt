<p>consented to my staying; but I had to go off duty for a couple of days, &amp; rest: if I was not substantially improved I was to go back.  The rest seems to have improved me; anyway I have got back to duty again; and I have carried rations out to our old post, amongst other things.  I'm still dopey &amp; a little feverish: seems to get better, but am played out almost immediately.  A peculiar symptom is the curious tricks the eyes play.  Looking at Fritz flares I was amazed to see a red cross in the centre of them.  Thought it a new kind of flare; but although the same illusion struck me time after time, I assured myself by asking others that it was nothing but an illusion.</p>
<p>The man who was brought down after lying out in No Mans Land died shortly after reaching the ravine.  We have had only a few casualties; but sickness is very prevalent; &amp; the men who line up with trench fever and trench feet make a big daily parade.  A lot of gas has been thrown about too, &amp; some are gassed.</p>
<p>After the stunt in the line Edwards put me on to the patrol to the next post, which is held by Tommies &ndash; The Devons &ndash; and is in the centre of what used to be the church in Holebeke, now only mounds of rubble.  In this church are the remains of a aeroplane &amp; the graves of an English airman &amp; pilot who came a crash there.</p>
<p>At the post next to us on the right the sergeant in charge, I hear, had a bad time with a couple of his men.  One of them, an ex-clergyman, swore like a bottle-oh when told that he would have to go to the top of a flight of steps (the support is in the ruins of a house) to keep his watch.  He apologised later, saying that he knew that as a clergyman he should not have used the language, but he lost all</p>
