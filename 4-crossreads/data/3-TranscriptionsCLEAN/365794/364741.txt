Monday 3 December 1917Lovely days now & Miss Moreton & I fly to town & shop 2-5 then home & duty again.Robson (N.Z.) leg ampn. 1/2 way to knee, condition not good for operation & veins for some distance above amp. full of clotted blood.  Why oh why do not more doctors come out & these pts. get more attention.  Many cases of secondary haem. occur of late & deaths are numerous.No war news save more fighting up in Palestine.  A notice is up calling for volunteers for Palestine, sisters are applying quickly.  We are debarred not having been here 6 months.I find Miss Womald asked Matron to let me stay in Connaught & Matron spoke very highly of me to her etc., so now I must put up with all the "nagging".
