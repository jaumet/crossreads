11-8-16Fri 11thHad a good rest last night & were not called till 5.30 this morning & the sun was up when we awoke;  Watered our horses at the same Hod as yesterday & had a very quiet time today resting & picking dates that are ripe enough to eat.  these are very bitter with the skin on but very good fruit something like apples to taste when peeled
This morning we could hear the artillery to the east & we received word this evening saying the infantry advanced to Bir-El-Abd, & the Turks left early this morning with very little fightingEvery man in camp that could be mounted on any sort of a horse was sent out & joined us today, we are getting plenty of water & rations here
