draining was completed. I got the party on carrying bricks and stones and I can tell you we made a good job of it, the officers reckoned it was a fine piece of work and so it was, this is where country chaps score, they have had the experience and know how to handle things in a practical way. 
There was a heavy and short bombardment last night. I believe the 2nd Bde hopped over and took a position.
14th Was sound asleep last night when the S.M. rushed in at 1 o'clock and woke us up, I wondered what on earth was the matter, but it turned out that we would be moving off at 6 in the morning and he fool like had to wake us up and let us know so we rose at 4.30 had our breakfast and moved off in the dark.
