Duncan was order off today sudden so I got the Staff Captain and gave him a proper do too . 26/6/19 Unevent . Some nurs came and play tenni and danc afterward . 27/6/19 Went to Bath by a train at 10.58 and there saw about some photograph . Onli stay in the town for half an hour and then caught an express to London . The journey between Warminst and Westburi is uninterest but between Westburi and Bath and Bath and Swindon there is some of the prettiest sceneri I have seen in England . Reach
