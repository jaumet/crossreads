excitement here this morning. A disguised German Plane was hovering round very low & with our colours on. Goodness knows how long he had been there without any notice being taken of him. When by some means or other he was recognised & a tornado of shells were sent at him from all directions. He immediately began to manouvre & ascend & at first it seemed as though he would get away but a salvoe of shells was seen to burst round him & the machine quivered & commenced to come down finally falling about one mile away from us.  We were all watching previous to his being discovered as a disguised plane & it came as a shock to us.
