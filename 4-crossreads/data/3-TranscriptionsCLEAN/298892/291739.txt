The new doctor arrived to-night - Capt. Bartram. We had him with us before when Capt. Rosenthal was ill. He is a very conscientious worker and we all get on well with him. With his heavy rather clumsy frame, stolid face, and plodding walk,  one would  a casual observer would be more likely to take him for a farmer than a doctor. Still he is not so dense as he appears and is wide awake to the dodges of the habitually sick men who contract an ailment whenever there is any strenuous or unpleasant work to be done.
Our battalion are at present engaged on night fatigue in ^(or around) the trenches. Their chief job is burying the dead Fritz who have been lying about since the push. Not a very pleasant task when you recollect that it is now over three weeks
