<p>27/11/15<br/>Cold during afternoon and heavy rain set in during the evening.  Brought blankets down to tent near mess and having made tent secure turned in early.  Wind and rain howling and roaring round<br/>sea dashing over pier and carried some canteen stores stacked down there.  Tent flapping terrifically.  Rain teemed till 0000, but slept fitfully until then Suddenly awakened by other occupants just in time to grab tent pole.  Held on there for 20 minutes while others got on to tent pegs.  Bitterly cold and got little rest until 0800, bad with dysentery</p>
<p>28/11/15<br/>Up at 0800. Sunday.  Saw it snow for first time falling in driving flakes  hills covered with snow.  Biting wind. Took pick &amp; shovel and trenched mess and built up a dry floor inside.  Spent day huddled over brazier.  151 Bde &amp; a lot of 54th Division leaving peninsular.  Waterbarge driven ashore and things smashed up.  Went down to beach at 1700 and found things in a terrible state.  Great seas dashing over the dummy  Dreadnaught and crashing in beyond breakwater  Road awash and pier apparently not existent</p>
