La-Gourge in the evening for the first time I had the pleasure of hearing a fife drum band.

Much cooler than usual. Walked to Merville during afternoon, about 6 Kilos returned through Neuf Berquin about 7 Kilos; long but pleasant walk. Distribution of honors took place at Merville just prior to our arrival, consequently the town was full of military men of high rank, also a good number of men who had received honors. Met five Tommies who had received the Military Medal; they were 5 of 27 who came back from an attack made by 670 on the Somme on July 1st last.
