<p>Sunday 6 November, 1915<br/>The mate of the sheep killed came back last night &amp; my Batman gave chase, he is a boundary rider from the YINKO &amp; his imitation bleat as he scaled the hills in the dark was good &ndash; but no answering BAA was heard but perhaps some other night &ndash; We hope so &ndash; Our Medical Officer has discovered a new way to kill the flies in the LATRINE viz:-  dropping a "Bomb"!!! but the cold will fix them I think, I pity the Italians with their Paper Yokes cut to slip over head &amp; wear under Tunic to keep out the cold.</p>
