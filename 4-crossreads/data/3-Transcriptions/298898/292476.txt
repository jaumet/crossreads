<p>a little way out of Bapaume so that we got back by 1 A.M.</p>
<p>Saturday 24th March<br/>Daylight saving comes into force again today the clocks going forward one hour during the night. Spent all day getting stuff away back to "Bernafay" in preparation for a removal, very tiring work as difficult to carry stuff in the tunnel. A note just arrived for me to go to Bapaume tomorrow so will shift quarters in the morning.</p>
<p>Sunday 25th March<br/>Started the lads working on clearing out the place &amp; then went back to "Bernafay" to arrange for stuff to be sent to Bapaume. Whilst there took the opportunity to have a hot bath &amp; change of new underclothing. Went back to the tunnel for my blankets &amp; continued on to Bapaume calling at the various posts on the way having tea at "Lusenhof"</p>
