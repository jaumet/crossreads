Wednesday June 4th Capetown
Off to shore about 10 am had a roam round over the Pier : pictures at night in afternoon : Capetown is a decent little place but there are too many shades of colour among the people for my liking : the "boys" behaved fairly though the usual drunks were about : Table Mountain looks well when the clouds hang around the top forms a nice background for the town on the foreshore
