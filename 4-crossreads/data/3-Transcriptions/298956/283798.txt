<p>little.  Then she slowly started to settle down, her stern deck was just awash and then the old "Matunga" gave her last dive.  She dipped her stern and up went her bow in the air.  She stood almost upright and then took her dive to the bottom, and so ended the career of the old "Matunga".</p>
<p>Nothing exciting happened until about 10 p.m. on the 5th September.  We were steaming along easily when bang went the ships sides.  We waited expecting to hear shots fired but nothing further happened.  That same night the "Wolf" laid her last mines off Singapore, 111 in all.  When the last mine went over the Germans gave three cheers.</p>
<p>The next day we were told that on the previous night we had passed a cruiser and the Commander of the "Wolf" said that only that he had mines on board, he would have launched a torpedo into the cruiser.  I am jolly glad he didn't because I knew what would have happened to us.</p>
<p>At about 4 p.m. on the 6th September, we steamed past Batavia and through the straits into the Indian Ocean.  We could see the township and several steamers and sailing ships laying in the harbour.  We were so near and yet so far from freedom.  After the mines were finished, the Huns were rather busy, lifting mine rails from the deck and the next hatch to us, and cleaning the 'tween decks ready for more prisoners.  Meanwhile the seaplane was also under deck.  Work carried on as usual, the 'tween deck was all ready for painting and we were thinking who would be the next to occupy that 'tween deck.  When on the 26th September the seaplane was taken on deck and placed together in a hurry and up she went.  She stayed away until 12 noon and all was excitement amongst the Huns.  At 2 p.m. we sighted smoke on the horizon, and the prisoners were ordered under deck.  All the hatch covers except two were put on.  Through the opening in the two we could see to the top of the main mast.</p>
<p>The "Wolf" was steaming full speed, and at 3 p.m. we heard the ships sides drop with a bang and watched the German Ensign hoisted to the mast</p>
