 7/10/18 Villeret pass trench and strongpost and posit ravag by War . Came back through Viller Brettoneux and pass all the wood and trench so familiar to us . Pull into St Roch station and march off down the boulevard with band play . A group of Frenchmen gave us a great ovat . It was imposs to help feel a thrill of pride while march through the town Australian men had save . A long rout march in the dark brought us via Ailly-sur-Somm to the poor villag of St . Vast . ( En rout today we pass an enorm N.S.W gun train and also a most luxuri camouflag train of an Armi Command ) . All were tire out on reach St Vast and soon tumbl into billet . At night the tramp of troop resound through the villag . Our transport delay on anoth train meant there was no food or no blanket here .
