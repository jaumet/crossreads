13.9.16Wed 13thSig Cpl Bassan & Tpr Hastie was up at the Orderly Room again this morning to receive sentence as they were found guilty of receiving stolen property from Lieut Pearce whom they found dead at Bir-El-Hamisieh. the article they were tried on was a prismatic Compass, Bassan sentence was to be reduced to the ranks & 60 days  hard labor & Hastie 80 days No 2 Field punishment; Col Granville has appealed against it & much indignation is shown by everyone in the Regt & General Lawrence will be a wise man if he keeps well away from this Regt unless he wants to be counted out. Everyone is very dissatisfied in being attached to an English Division & the Officers are cursing if anything
