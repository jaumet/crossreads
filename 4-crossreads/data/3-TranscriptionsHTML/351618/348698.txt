<p>Suvla first and it was a crisp nice trip. I was tired &amp; slept most of the time. Were off to Anzac &amp; arrived about 12.30 &amp; waited patiently for a Horse barge top come out to tranship our stores to. Unfortunately they were all engaged &amp; only small Pinnaces came &amp; a few cases were taken ashore. I made a bid to get a few on only got 7 on &amp; those I took ashore &amp; left Eltham with the others &ndash; the Trawler having to back again to Imbros at her usual starting time. The fatigue party was waiting &amp; I had a little tea with McLaren (Lowland Bty) &amp; left cases with Ammunition Party. I went along to Olly Gunderson to arrange to get some coal put on wagon we passed along</p>
