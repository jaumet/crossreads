Our money is running short and still nothing forthcoming from the Ambassadors promise.  We receive a letter from our Captain saying that we could expect a speedy release as Bulgaria would be joining in on our side within a few days.  We see by the papers that things are bad for Europeans in the Capital no one being allowed out after sunset without a guard.
