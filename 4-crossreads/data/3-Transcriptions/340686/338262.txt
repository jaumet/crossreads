<p>Got up about nine cleaned dixies and generally tidied up the hut and after dinner went over the [Bernafay] and got some wood which was frozen and hard to chop. 5 letters arrived including two christmas cards. Went out to job at 4-15. taking a water bottle of hot tea. Very cold and woollen hats and gloves were essential. The tea was frozen when I got out there. Our guns were bombarding a good deal but enemy's were quiet until 10-30 when he sent over about a dozen big H.E. quite close. The pieces could be heard viciously tearing above our [sap]. Knocked off at 11 &amp; cold wind coming home and went straight to bed.</p>
