Mde takes no interest in show but busies herself among her accounts as if the air was congenial [nay] even necessary for complicated computations. Entrance fee is 1.60 &amp; [indecipherable] 75 centimes.</p>

<p>29-6-19<br/>The day after peace &ndash; sleep till 11 am ie from 7 am &amp; then get up &amp; go to the races at Longschamp.</p>
<p>This is the race of the year The Grand Prix of Paris &amp; everyone is there. For my part there is too much of a crowd. Entrance is 25 fr &amp; as my fortune is 48 fr I spend most in entering &amp; looking at the wonderful dresses which only a Parisian could wear.</p>
<p>I succeed in losing on both my bets &amp; return with only 15 francs to my name &amp; not knowing where I can raise anymore.</p>
<p>[Mdlle] Brisson has invited me to dine at her place to night &amp; I get away from course after the Grand Prix which was won by an English horse Galloper Light owned by Rothschild</p>
