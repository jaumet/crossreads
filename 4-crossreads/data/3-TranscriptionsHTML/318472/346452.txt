<p>15 August 1918<br/>Thursday<br/>A fairly heavy sea running and rather a heavy swell. Weather cloudy and inclined to be wet &ndash; just a little rain! Boat only doing about <strike>8</strike> miles per hour owing the heavy head wind &amp; sea.</p>
<p>1918 August 16<br/>Friday<br/>A very nice fine day &amp; a beautiful sea with just a little roll. Nothing important happening on the boat. Another concert at night to cheer the lads up. Good war news. Reported 30,000 prisoners &amp; 1,000 Guns since 4-8-18</p>
