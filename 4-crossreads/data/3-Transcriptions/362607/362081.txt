<p>Dear Mum,<br/>This is the Quay of Le Havre &amp; the Museum which I intend to go through when I get the chance. The Museum is the big place on the left. The rue de Paris, one of the best Streets in town for Business begins here &amp; runs away up into the City. The building on the Harbour front &amp; right up to the electric light structure are without one exception Cafes. Smelly places they are to. Gee if one could only go to a place that did not stink of food. Fortunately we have good meals here &amp; no one has no need to consort to any Cafe.  Kindest Regards to all the Friends &amp; Neighbours.  Love Harry.</p>
