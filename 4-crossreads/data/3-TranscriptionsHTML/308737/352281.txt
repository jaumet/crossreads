<p>for a stroll &amp; saw a fight (or what nearly developed into one) outside one of the leading music halls. That decided us not to go inside so we went back to the Hotel &amp; had a game of billiards. We were both very bad but Jack was worse than I was, &amp; so I won We went out and found a cafe &amp; had some chocolate &ndash; foreign chocolate is almost always &amp; a nice drink - &amp; then I had to get back to camp &amp; Jack went off to the railway station.</p>
<p>I am living in luxury (comparatively ) &amp; your Jack doesn't seem at all badly off. The food has been good all through. Capt John Bean's lines are some of the best in camp &ndash; I see a good bit of him, &amp; I also see something of Harry Butler who is Major 2nd command of the 3rd A.M.C, not with one of the regiments.</p>
<p>Most of the men are splendid &ndash; my letters (if they publish them as I think they probably will without censoring) give about the truth. The old South African soldiers, &amp; some old Imperial men are causing nearly all the trouble. They have led some of the young men into trouble which they would not have got into otherwise. I am just off to the Canal for a few days to have a look round &ndash; there may be trouble there but if so you'll hear it before this arrives<br/>Chas</p>
