<p>I managed to get in my service today (Sept 27). The admiral carried out my suggestion and we had it at five oclock. He gave me no restriction whatsoever, but within ten seconds of my pronouncing the blessing the anchor was up and we were off to sea on patrol duty. After patrol we return into harbour at daybreak. I  <u>should</u> like to go ashore &amp; explore the place, but it is not permitted. The troops or rather a  few of them, have not been behaving very well. One or two assaulted a Japanese lady, to what extent I do not know; they were sentenced to 90 days imprisonment, far too little, if half the reports were true. Two officers, officers   <strike>migh</strike> mind you, broke into a private place ashore and made themselves blind tight on champagne. Result court martial &amp; dismissal. Others have distinguished themselves by looting the wine stores in Sumatra; they have been sent to Sydney for trial, I believe. The discipline of some of the troops is a thing to marvel at. Three men have been dismissed this ship in disgrace, an E.R. named Anjard for insolence, Macdonald, A.B. for refusing duty and for general uselessness, and   <strike>White</strike> Smith a stoker for striking a superior officer. The last also got eighteen months imprisonment. But when you think there were about 6000 all told, you will see that these bad cases represent but an infinitesimal percentage. The niggers crowd round the ships in their  interesting catamarans the canoes cut out of palm trees hollowed out by red hot stones. They come with a miserly basket, carrying two or three cocoa nuts which they are very anxious to exchange for bread and tobacco. Owing to lack of encouragement, their visits are getting fewer. I do admire Rabaul. The lofty hills are clothed with trees and verdure to the very top. The heat is much more tolerable than Fiji where the humidity makes life a positive burden. Here it is dry heat, and the nights are exquisitely cool. At the entrance to the harbour is a great pinnacle of rock 80 to 100 feet high, thrown up by an earthquake or internal convulsion some 30 years ago. On the top is a cross</p>
