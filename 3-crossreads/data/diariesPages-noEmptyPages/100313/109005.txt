Still the freeze continues but this morning is warmer forbodes the thaw. A little sun came out later and incrusted trees formed a most lovely sight. Tried out a few N.C.Os. on the parade ground (most of the men are on fatigue). Visited Col. James and had a yarn. After lunch marched out all available men to a concert down at Neuve Eglise. At 2 p.m. inspected the Transport Section and found them all very fair and the horses comfortable. The officers of the 23rd. Battn. played us here this afternoon and we beat them at football. It became dark very early and our evenings are very long. After Mess we had a lecture by Sutherland and Groves on Intelligence and I followed with some remarks. Put in the evening writing letters c. Fizele our artist went to London yesterday to compete in a drawing competition.
