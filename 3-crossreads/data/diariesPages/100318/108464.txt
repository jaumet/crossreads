Villers-Brettoneux
found them alright and that there is limited accomodation only for the companies. Went to see the doctor later in the afternoon and had a talk to him regarding Sparrow who arrived later in the afternoon. Returning from here just on the fringe of Villers Brettoneux we could get a grand view of the Cathedral of Amiens dominating the plain. The 28th Battalion relieving us has a number of people up here reconnoitring. The rain kept on for a long while and after mess one of the walls of our little mess fell in and I had just left the place in time to avoid injury. There is surely 'something doing" as all sorts of rumours are going the rounds. Major Mitchell
