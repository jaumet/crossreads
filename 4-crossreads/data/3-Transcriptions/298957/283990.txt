<p>7th April (Friday)<br/>Still Hot. Stacking timber for Engineer Carpenters who are here to build a Mess Hut. There was trouble at Headquarters today over <strike>a</strike> cases of Brandy that were "pinched" by Transport men.</p>
<p>8th April (Saturday)<br/>Very Hot. Went with party of 10 to Rail Head to sort out what we required from our Universal Kit Bags because there is a chance of our losing them. Having done this we travelled down the Anzac Desert Railway to Ferry Post</p>
