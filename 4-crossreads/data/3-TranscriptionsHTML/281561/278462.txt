<p>14/4/18.<br/>Have had two more days general leave here in Capetown, in very pleasant weather. A striking feature of the town is the variety of colours to be seen in the population. It is only just a burg and the dutch appear to be very luke warm. There are very modern docks here. The "Orontes" has arrived and will take on board the fellows from the other ships we will go on to Durban.<br/>15/4/18<br/>Sailed from Capetown at 10.A.M. We are getting along at a spanking rate now, must be doing 15 knots. We are steaming alone.<br/>16/4/18<br/>Kept steaming at a high speed all day. At 6.P.M. we swept round a point and came into a semi circular bay and anchored off the Town of Port Elizabeth. The lights of the town stretch all around the bay.</p>
