Saw Miss Busby & Mr. Rayment.  Dr. Mason would not let me go to camp as it was raining.  Went up and got a certificate from him in evening. 
 Saturday 1 April 1916 Went for a swim with the boys to the Spit. In evening Hal, Fred & I went in to see "Under fire" at the Criterion.  A good play of the period before the war and up to the German advance on Paris in August.
