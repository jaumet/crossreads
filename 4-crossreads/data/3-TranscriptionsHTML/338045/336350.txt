<p>&amp;spend the day walking round &amp; talking. One learns to appreciate beautiful English country on days like these. Grand concert in theatre until 9 pm.</p>
<p>Nov 10th &ndash; Friday</p>
<p>Feeling very tired &amp; not fit for much exertion. Very monotonous &amp; I am already sick &amp; tired of hospital. No treatment here &amp; very little notice taken of any of our movements. What is ultimately our fate is hard to say. Probably back to France.</p>
<p>Nov 11th &ndash; Saturday</p>
<p>Beautiful day, for a change. Very little to do. Write some letters, walk round the grounds. Bed early.</p>
