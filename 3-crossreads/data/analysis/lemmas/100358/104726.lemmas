 their way . They must have read my face when they told me by word of mouth , and just left it at that . Oh , how hopeless I feel . I ve alway look forward more than anyth els to see him over here . Fourteenth of August , whi befor I left Australia . If you could onli know how much I look forward to meet the 13th Battalion " Somewher in Franc " , and seek him out . When I learnt of the heavi fight that the Anzac had been engag in , on my arriv in England , I thought that he would have inde been lucki to have escap without a wound , but the other never dawn on me . One great comfort come to me over here on my own , and that is , as a soldier , I cannot but recognis my dear brother die a death deserv of the greatest of honor and respect from those of us still abov the sod . But I dare not look in the retrospect of those happi time togeth , Its just too aw . There is just a big blank in front of me . You know , we all look forward to the great homecom , made a great exhalt by the feel of particip in the greatest and most glorious of martial victori , and to the meet of our relat in our happi home , who , separ from us , have each toil toward the great end . This I have look forward to as probabl the greatest moment of my life . But it all blot out , and I feel as if I am rob of a just reward . I feel like a crimin serv a long and tedious sentenc , and as if I will wend my way home shamefac and by back road . Dear old Alan , how he play the game , onli to go the way of the glorious , when the Anzac had done their second glorious feat , captur Posier villag , in the shock fight which follow . He was lucki to be pick up by the AMC , and taken to the Casualti Clear Station , where he will have had a decent burial , in a grave mark by a pioneer 's rough cross . But this is not the place to mourn a brother , word are inadequ . I just think of him and realis I 'm too late . What a patho , a rend , tear , unforgiv sin , to be too late . A soldier should never be too late , and yet I have arriv here too late !
