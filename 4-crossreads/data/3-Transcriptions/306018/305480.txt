<p>January 1918<br/>&amp; had afternoon tea at the Casino San Stefano.  It is a fine place with a covered in garden &amp; quite a popular resort on a Sunday.  The orchestra give  a concert &amp; the music is splendid.  It is right on the sea shore &amp; is quite charming.  Must be glorious in the summer time.  The worst part of the trip to Alexandria is the coming back on the midnight horror.  It takes about 7 or 8 hours to do the 120 miles &amp; there are generally a fair number of passengers, only officers are allowed to travel first class so it is impossible to get a comfortable seat.<br/>On the 26th I went to the Races at Heliopolis.  Had  a good afternoons sport &amp; managed to pay my expenses with a few piastres to the good.  On Sunday I went out to dinner to Mrs Briggs.  We had a great feed, with Yorkshire pudding first I have had since I left home.</p>
