Putting message in tin and throwing it over to Abdul asking Turks to desert to us and pointing out way to come in, also arranging pass word for them to give sentries. Interpreter went up to forward sap and was calling out Osmanie perdarsher ? "Turkish brothers" but the irony came in as every time we shouted "Turkish brothers", a good big shell landed on his trenches from our battery in rear. 
When day broke we could see a corpse just out in front. At dark a man will crawl out and drag him in. We shall have to get on early as "Turkish brother" will be on the same racket. 
Monitors putting some good shells into Turkish trenches. The sea very still and dotted with little craft, sweepers perfect sunset.
2020 A most exciting evening. Threw a message over into Crator in a bottle asking them to come in and assuring them of good treatment. At 2000 12 seen coming towards us on left but by bungling they were fired on by machine gun some of them came quite close (about 6) and cut entanglements a little which we let them do. Went up with Major Newcombe and he called out to them in Arabic but got no response. Other small groups seen on other spots. Our men kept them covered but did not fire as we are most anxious for intelligence reasons to get a prisoner or two. 
Returned to HQ and met interpreter and Major Anderson and took them along to Tambour. A long way through firing line and through tunnels passages in pitch dark ? all blocked up with waiting men standing to arms. An electric torch if shown in trenches silhouettes the heads of the men as they poke them over the top observing, the periscope being useless at night. Major Anderson would persist in using his, despite being told and the men saying "put the light out" had no effect.
