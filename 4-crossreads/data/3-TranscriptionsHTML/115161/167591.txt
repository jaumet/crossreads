At the time I write about, the shell-holes, and all other supplies of water were frozen, so I had perforce to forego my morning ablutions. Luckily there was a fair quantity of snow on the ground, so each morning before breakfast, would find me just clad in my boots, standing outside rubbing myself all over with this useful substitute for water. The fellows of course had quite decided that I was mad. It has been suggested that this habit of mine was the probable cause of my shortness of stature. Many fellows imagined I was doing this to produce &quot;Pneumonia&quot;&nbsp;or some such form of sickness, so that I might be sent &quot;back&quot; to the base.</p>

We are not like human beings now. we live in the earth like lizards, (I believe they do live in holes) or rabbits. The whole place is like a huge rabbit warren. Wherever you look you see a small opening in the ground. In the sides of big shell-holes was a favorite position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inside&nbsp;these&quot;holes&quot;there&nbsp;was&nbsp;just&nbsp;enough&nbsp;room to accomodate one or perhaps two men. I shared my dug-out with a corporal and I, just a &quot;digger&quot;.</p>
