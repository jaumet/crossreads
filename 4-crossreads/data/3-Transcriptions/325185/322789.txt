<p>Dear Father</p>
<p>Have just received two letters from you both dated July. I am pleased to hear programme reached you safely. I cant help smiling at Frank saying he saw me &amp; that he thought I would be sent home. I havint seen anything of Frank so far As for being bad enough to be sent back to Australia I wish I had been I certainly had a bad back couldent straighten myself up for a couple of weeks had a fortnight on the back bone The Dr said I was also suffering from Dability goodness knows what that is laziness perhaps. Too much bully beef etc Oh no I am too tough for that am going to soldier on until Kaiser Bill  has enough &amp; throws in the towel will be coming back to Australia</p>
