  
 for the day, most of them were suffering with trench feet. If this disease is not caught in time the feet are generally amputated. Weather bitterly cold. 
 Thursday 30th November. 10:30 a.m. In the Trenches again. Bob & I occupy a good -dug-out, a great improvement on those we lived in a fortnight ago. Fritz very quiet this morning. One poor fellow in the dug-out was suffering terrible agony with Trench feet & Hands. We carried him along to our 4th Relay Post. Working for the next 24 hours at the R.A.P. which is about 3/4 of a mile from the Front Line. My  first  second carry was rather a severe one, carried a man on my back to the 4th Post from the R.A.P. He soon got very heavy, only had one spell as it was a work of art to lift him up again, without hurting his feet. I almost collapsed when I arrived at the Post, but a hot drink soon put me right again. Our next Stretcher Case
