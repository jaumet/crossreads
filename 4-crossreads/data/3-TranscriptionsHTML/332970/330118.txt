<p>Shrapnel was bursting above them the whole time, and I am afraid <strike>a g</strike> they have had a very bad time. From 6 to midnight we got what rest we could, but cramped in a trench there is not much room to stretch. From midnight to 6 we were in the firing line and now we are busy improving our trench against <strike>sh</strike> possible shrapnel. All night long <strike>we</strike> fire continued, and the whiz of bullets overhead is very insistent. <strike>We</strike> The Turks are only about 100 yards in front, and in the intervals between firing, we can hear them talking. The still moments between the bursts of rifle fire are weird, &amp; eyes &amp; ears are strained for traces of the enemy. One dead Turk is about 10 yards in front of the line, &amp; his knapsack is just discernable if we look over. We are fairly secure against shell fire here, but it is a solid strain. It is now 48 hours since any of us had a sleep, and it doesn't look as if we'll have any for another 48. Another man hit in the same place as the one yesterday. The enemy now has a machine gun in the line opposite us, and its rattle adds to the volume which fly over us.</p>
