<p>fixed up by the Germans, you'd just wonder how on earth our fellows ever got through.  Its simply marvellous.  Oh Mac one's heart &amp; admiration go out to the infantry, British &amp; Australian too.  The things they do &amp; what they go through every one of them, really nothing anyone could do would be too good for them.  And when wounded they are so cheerful &amp; casual.  The artillery &amp; others are well off compared to the foot slogger, he's <u>the man</u> of the whole show.</p>
<p>We are living in German Dug outs, rather cramped &amp; dark but not too bad &amp; pretty safe.  I feel like a troglodyte, I work &amp; sleep down here &amp; only appear in the daylight (blinking like an owl) for my meals.  My word "I'll have lots to say when I get back", to paraphrase a song.  The flies are bad &amp; the mice &amp; the lice.  Ugh but we've all got 'em.  We are rather piggy but are hoping for a move soon &amp; a chance then to clean up &amp;</p>
