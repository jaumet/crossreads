<p>"My little wet home in the Trench"<br/>To the tune of my little Grey home in the west.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>I have a little wet home in the trench<br/>Which the rainstorms continually drench<br/>There is a dead Turk close by<br/>With his feet to the sky<br/>And he gives off a beautiful stench<br/>Underneath in the place of a floor<br/>There is a mass of wet mud and some straw<br/>And the Jack Johnsons tear<br/>Through the rain&ndash;sodden air<br/>Oer my little wet home in the trench</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>There are snipers who keep on the go<br/>So you must keep your nappers down low<br/>And the star shells at night<br/>Make a deuce of a light<br/>Which causes the language to flow<br/>Then bully and biscuits we'll chew<br/>For tis days since we've seen a stew<br/>But with shells dropping there<br/>There's no place to compare<br/>With my little wet home in the Trench</p>
