12.10.17Action.  First barrage was fired at zero plus 6 - the rate of fire had to be reduced to 50 rounds to enable a sufficient supply to be kept in hand for the defence.  There is nothing special of tactical or technical interest to report as regards fire with the exception that the shortage of "Clinos" causes unnecessary exposure to Officers and N.C.Os.  This barrage ceased fire at zero plus 3 hours, and preparations were made to advance.  A road was first attempted to the left of the Cemetary but as the enemy's barrage was so thick, this road was abandoned.  The railway was tried, not then being under shell fire.  When entering the cutting, an enemy aeroplane flew exceedingly low over the advancing batteries.  Concentrated fire of 5.9s quickly followed - the cutting was immediately abandoned, and the batteries returned with remarkably few casualties.
