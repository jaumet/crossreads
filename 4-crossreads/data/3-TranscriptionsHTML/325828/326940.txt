<p><u>An Afterthought</u>  7.6.16.<br/>The mails for Australia close here as follows<br/>June 1st<br/>June 15th<br/>July 13th<br/>July 27th<br/>So that after my next letter which (OV) will be dated June 14th there will be a spell of 4 weeks instead of only 2 as it is now.  You will know then if you do not receive them for 3 or 4 weeks after the 15th mail closes.<br/>I will write every week tho' in case it is altered<br/>Love from Leo.</p>
