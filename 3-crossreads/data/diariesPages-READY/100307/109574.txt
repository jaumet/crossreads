Bazentin Bapaume
17/3/17
Fine day and very quiet. Loafed round in tent all day. Busy railhead here and the starting place for the Decauvilles. All run by soldiers. Rumoured that our people are well through Bapaume.
18/3/17
Breakfast at 6.30 am and then turned out. Tents were struck and put on limbers and Miles and myself pushed on ahead. The route lay through Martinpuich and Le Sars through both of which there were many troops moving forward. Passed right over what was our firing line a few days ago and near the Butte (which looks a very small mound when you are right near it) we found the railway yards coal dump and much broken material. Hereabouts is desperately churned up and torn about which shows what Fritz has gone through. Much of his wire remains quite intact.
We kept on the main Bapaume road (an excellent track) lined with trees on both sides. Someone had planted a triumphant flag atop the Butte. Their heavy railway had run alongside the road and on it was a train which our guns had evidently got right into
