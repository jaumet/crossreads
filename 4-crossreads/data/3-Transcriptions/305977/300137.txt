<p>to meet the train at W Maitland.</p>
<p>28th Novr<br/>Arrived Armidale 8.40am &amp; got a car about 9 oclock for Dorrigo.  Met Billy Ryder &amp; Mr Schley at Wollomombi.  Got to Guy Fawkes for dinner.  Fairly cool breeze blowing &amp; on the way from Guy Fawkes it started raining.  Kept up all the way driving right into the car.  Got to Dorrigo Roy was waiting for the car.  Had a yarn to a lot of Dorrigo citizens &amp; Roy borrowed Marsden's sulky &amp; we took the short cut home arriving at 7.25am.  Found the place looking A.1. My only wish I hadn't to go back.</p>
<p>29th Novr<br/>Had a quiet morning at home.  Looked round the place &amp; was much pleased with the progress made during my absence.  After dinner all of us went round to Sturts to spend the afternoon &amp; stayed to tea.  Got home about 10.</p>
