17/7/17 Beaulencourt
What a man of moods. Contrast conclusion of entry 14/7/17 with that of 16/7/17. Reveille 5.30am. feeling livery nervy all strung up over nothing. Left camp at 7.30 and marched to Fremicourt where the whole Brigade rendezvoused well under cover of the contour of the ground. Jumped off at 10 in an attack against Villers au Flos in conjunction with the 24th. The first phases went well and our casualties would have been light indeed. Once in the village the attack naturally becomes broken up it is extremely hard to keep control. Any alteration in plan or any trouble in the fighting is extremely hard to estimate at its true value for some time. During the afternoon went into details of the projected bombing attack which is going to necessitate great preparations organization. Stewart goes to Paris tomorrow and Harricks will carry on in his place. Went to an excellent lecture by Wertheim on the German Army and its morale down at the Sugar Factory returned to camp feeling very tired.
