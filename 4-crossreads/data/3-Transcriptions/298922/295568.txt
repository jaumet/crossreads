<p>Saturday 15 September 1917</p>
<p>Alex<br/>Went to the Races &amp; lost my good gold but had a lot of fun. One gets into a crowd of officers of all Regiments here <strike>&amp; must go along with them. Still no word of a boat so one of our Majors have been recalled to his Regiment, we are afraid this may happen to more of us.</strike></p>
<p>As I have told you before the Totalisator &amp; Starting gate are used &amp; most of the horses are grey stallions (Arab).</p>
<p>"Quail" are landing all along the coast &amp; the Natives catch them easily poor beggars being very tired after their fly across the Mediteranean. Too tired to make good shooting.</p>
