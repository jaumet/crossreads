  
 Monday 3 January 1916 We started cutting chaff in the morning, but stripped our main driving cogs so had to take machine to pieces and put on fresh ones.  Cut 18 bags. Dr. Nicholl came out in the car and took Mardie & me to Mudgee.  Train very crowded. 
 Tuesday 4 January 1916 Arrived Sydney after fair trip.  Came to Lyttleton.  Aunt Katie and I went in to town, bought a safety razor, knife, pen & note book.  Aunt K & Aunt Min gave me an air pillow.  Saw Major Timothy.  Have been posted to L.H.  Charlie Mc gave me a letter to Capt. Downes.  Went down to Nohovel.
