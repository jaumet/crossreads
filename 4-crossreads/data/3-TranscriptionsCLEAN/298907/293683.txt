present for our Sister is going to get married very shortly, & seeing as how she has treated us so well, I proposed among ourselves "(the Aussies) that we should get a little collection & make her a present from us, they all fell in with the idea readily so I got the money 30/- off the 9 of us & then had to decide what to buy I eventually hit on a pair of silver salt cellars & spoons in a nice little leather case, I thought they would be suitable, the boys all reckon they are fine, the Tommies in this Ward did not like it because we were buying on our own, but we always stick together whenever possible, & we all thought it better to give her something from us alone & hang the Tommies, personally I have very little time for the majority of them.
