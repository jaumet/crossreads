  
 Sunday 14 May 1916 Another strange Sunday. Reveille at 2.30, my sergt. waking me quarter of an hour earlier. Heated some coffee & had bread & butter, jam & bully beef for breakfast. Fall in went at 3.30, & then on the parade ground we were kept waiting some time for the men from the 3rd Battn. Marched to the station with the band, hurried the men into the cattle trucks & off the train went thro' Boulogne, Calais, northwards, thro' St. Omen south-east, then east thro' Hazebrouck to Steenwerck, the railhead W of Armentieres arriving there about 1 o'c. A delightfully pretty trip thro' fertile low-lying country, the exquisite peacefulness of the scene at the villages being only broken by the distant crash of big guns at irregular intervals. Much of the country was traversed by waterways & canals & it was interesting to see the barges being towed or pushed along by poles. At the railhead we were met by an officer who guided us out over rough cobble roads covered with slush & muck to the H.Q. It was a most trying march & many of the men knocked up badly: did not feel too good myself with topboots on: toe pretty sore. From H.Q. took the party along one of the lanes & there issued the rations that had been brought, & at 7 o'c handed the drafts over to their battn. guides. Reported to H.Q. managed to dig up a cup of tea & then bed in an 11th Batt. billet. Heavy small gun firing & flares all along the salient abt. 3 to 5 miles distant from Sailly.
