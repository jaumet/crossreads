[28th Sept. contd]1st, 2nd, 4th & 5th Divs.At midday arrived at Winnezele our destination & was quite pleased that the thing was over.  Walked thro village after tea and it was quite lively.  Brought back memories of George St on Friday nights except that this crowd was all Khaki.
Saturday 29thMorning.  Assisting the drivers with their harness.  We had arranged cricket & football matches for the afternoon but had no sooner prepared everything for play when orders came for us to pack up at once in anticipation of an early move up to the trenches.  Consequently our Section were ordered to fall in with full gear at 5.30.  We were there all right and after inspection by the Colonel we thought that we would soon be moving on - but were disappointed.
We were kept on the ground for several hours more and as there were no signs of transport to take us up to the lines.  Enemy planes bombing in the evening interested us for some time & as it was getting cold we decided top rest in the barn.  We were enabled to have a few hrs sleep by this & in the morning we were ordered to stand by until the afternoon
