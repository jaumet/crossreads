<p>leave is getting very close, &amp; a chap must have a clean pair of pants to have a look at England in.<br/>I hear that Lieut Davidson was shot dead accidently yesterday by some of our chaps at the musketry school  I feel sorry for his mother for she has lost both husband &amp; son now in this war Major Davidson was a bonzer chap &amp; he was killed at "Lone Pine" on the 18th August last year, we were all very sorry he went under  The days are very long here now its light at 9 oclock in the evening &amp; again at 3 oclock in the morning so you see we don't have much darkness to sleep in. I have seen a good few partridges &amp; hares about here at times but of course they are out of season for shooting</p>
