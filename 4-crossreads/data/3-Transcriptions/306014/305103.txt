<p>Camp at "Lark Hill", about 1 &frac14; miles from "Rollestone".</p>
<p>After dinner we walked to the village of Orcheston, - about which I have already told you, - but to our disappointment we discovered that we could not get tea at the Inn, &amp; of course the store was closed. We had expected to get tea there &amp; to attend the local church in the evening, but had to wend our way back to Shrewton: Once there we soon found ourselves inside a small mud &amp; brick house with eggs &amp; bacon &amp; bread before us &amp; in the usual way we said good-bye to the victuals. After warming ourselves before the big open fire for an hour we adjourned to St Mary's Church &amp; were back to Camp by 9 o'clock, tired &amp; sore but still hopeful &amp; happy.</p>
