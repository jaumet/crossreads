Revielle at 6.Awoke to the air of Neptunes orchestra & expected great things through the day & we weren't disappointed either punctually at 1030 the police drew forth the first batch of victims including Teddy & 4 other officers everything went off well & some caused more fuss than others. The HMS Hampshire joined us today from Colombo she is a first class cruiser with 6 in guns & has now taken up her position at the head of the new lines. The New Zealanders & the Karros left the main body to steam on to Colombo to coal up & to [indecipherable] no 1 hold on account of the leak as we expect to sight land tomorrow after none for a fortnight also there's a chance of fruit also letters. While steaming ahead tonight the [indecipherable] was seen to stop & lower a boat she dropped a man overboard but they got him again. Received mess from King asking us to be "home" for Christmas due to arrive 15th.

Out of sight of other ships only the Jap on the horizon another horse dies in No 6 hold today cast overboard & fouls the screw. Teddy parades the men & lectures them with regard to beer all beer, eds stand out & are issued with chits & a corporal put on canteen to prevent second helping. The New Zealanders have been practicing shooting all day at floating targets. Another infantry horse takes bad & is raised up onto deck for fresh air. Concert takes place & as usual is good but not long enough. Played with Corp [indecipherable] my heat in chess but lost to superior play. Receive news of [indecipherable] captured also that we are running into Monsoon & later vivid lightning is seen dead ahead. Great expectations exist among the troops on the prospect of sighting land on the morrow. Fred comes out of the hospitalBed at 9.
