Marcinelle
Church parade at 10.30 a.m. was poorly attended and a wretched farce. The officers men only go under compulsion we find that voluntary parades fail. At 1.30 a draft of 70 men paraded in the Square to be seen off by me. I spoke the usual few words and then Band at head they marched off to report at the Divisional Reinf. Wing. In the evening went to ?La Traviata" with Gorman ? a fairly good show but weak orchestra a bad mannered audience. Entre actes the usual mingling of the sexes insanitarily. To Caf Central full of officers and some evil looking ugly girls dancing. Prostitution in an ugly industrial town like Charleroi is a nakedly ugly thing.
