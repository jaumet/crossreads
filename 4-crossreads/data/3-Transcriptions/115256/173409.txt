<p>Saturday 5 June 1915</p>
<p>Dec.<br/>12 months to-day since we left Australia &ndash; and ye Gods! what a twelve months!  It seems like 12 years since we sailed from Port Melbourne hoping, as at least 90&percnt; of us hoped, to be back within six months.  What a string of events since that memorable day!  Xmas '14 at sea on a troopship &ndash; the tropics &ndash; Egypt &ndash; the subtle charm of the East then the weary desert marches &ndash; preparations for the great Adventure &ndash; culminating in the meeting of the M.E.F. [Mediterranean Expeditionary Force] at Mudros. &ndash; April 25th &ndash; back in Egypt again, invalided &ndash; August 6th &ndash; Lemnos &ndash; Durrants Post again, &amp; finally the Evacuation.</p>
<p>And here we are at Lemnos again.  Great have been our feats of arms &ndash; but with what military, political, economic or diplomatic victories?  Certainly we have kept a huge Turkish Army occupied together with German &amp; Austrian artillery and that's about all.  Politically Gallipoli spells Mud &amp; Failure with a capital M &amp; F</p>
