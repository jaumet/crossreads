<p>February, 1917. Friday 2<br/>Hut orderly all day and only had to clean hut. Wrote letters and read all day. Didn't go to sleep till 12 last night and slept cold again. Day sunny but still cold and fairly windy. Chaps in this hut gone silly over stoves and changed another to-day with result that we are nearly smoked out.</p>
