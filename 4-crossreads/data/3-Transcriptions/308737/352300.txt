<p>Darling Mum<br/>I have received all your letters safely &amp; I hope my last letter &amp; former post cards got you. We have had a big "stouch-up" here lately, which you'll have heard all about before now. It has been a terrible battle, the troops here <u>have</u> suffered. Old Chas stopped a pill in the thigh &amp; in fact the bullet is still in his leg. He's walking about with it, &amp; <strike>in fact</strike> until he was grabbed by a local doc today &amp; made to rest he was'nt taking any notice of it &amp; said he would'nt get the bullet out until after this affair had blown over. Jack was wounded again &ndash; in the wrist this time with shrapnel. I have'nt seen him yet. Keith stopped one through the mouth, not serious but it will</p>
<p>P.S. Will you send me a couple of Story magazines or something to read, novels, anything. They are scarce here.</p>
