<p>Monday 14th<br/>Lecture by Capt. Harrison on :"Organisation of a Dressing Station".  He laid stress on <strike>several</strike> the following <strike>points</strike>,<br/>(1) That it is not the duty of a Field Ambulance to cater for the individual but the Army therefore if he came to two men one of whom was severely wounded &amp; likely to die and another who was slightly wounded, he would not spend much time on former since the latter is of more use to the Army.<br/>Afternoon.  The time was spent very interesting &ndash; in erecting a Dressing Station complete.  During the day it was showery &amp; sloppy and must be very uncomfortable in winter here.</p>
