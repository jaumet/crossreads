  
 14/10/15 pick and shovel the whole 24 hours and expecting to be blown to hell any moment.  300 bags of spoils taken out yesterday and tipped down slope engulfing a number of neat wooden crosses and making nameless graves of them.  The listeners with lighted candles crouched at the head of the drives patiently waiting and listening for enemy working 
 The artillery effect on infantry is remarkable.  The knowledge of effective support from our own guns raises morale up to high water mark while nothing starts more cheery remarks than the sight of a few good shrewd damagers landing on poor plurry Abdul.  The lads hate the enemy's 75's, gone with a whistle & crash before one can say dammit.  Four more wounded men died and buried on beach.  Quiet evening and so early to bed 
 15/10/15 Cold again  Went for a dip with Drummond water very sharp and rough, showering over barge side a little.  A short swim quite long enough and the wind whistled round legs while drying off.  Water pipe from barge pumping.  Men harnessed to large trucks with ropes hauling coal.  Back to mat before breakfast reading.  Good appetite and excellent steak for breakfast.  Several dogs have wandered over from Turks lines orders are these must be shot at once an account of disease - rabies
