I heard this morning that we are the last Australians who will attend this School, as the Americans are going to be sent here for training.27th. This morning I had to go to the Dr with a bad boil which I have just over my temple, it is very painful & my eye is nearly closed up, the Dr. ran a hot needle through it & squeezed the blood out, but it done no good for it is worse tonight & much bigger, very unpleasant. Done a bit of practical work this morning in the trenches, they have a rather good set of them here. This evening we were on "night operations" & it was the usual farce, everyone refusing to be killed, there they were on their knees not more than 10 yards
