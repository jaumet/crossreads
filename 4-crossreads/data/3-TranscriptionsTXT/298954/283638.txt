 Wed 17th Apl. A beech forest is a wonderful sight in the early spring &ndash; a different (one does not say superior) class of beauty to our own blue-gum and wattle groves. 
 The silvery beech-trunks;  the ground thickly carpeted with the mellow browns of last years leaves, and the vivid brilliant green of the young leaves all comprise a dazzling picture &ndash; after my caged existence of the last 10 months it was like frisking through a new world for a couple of hours. 
 Fri. 19th Apl. A different route on this morning's walk. 
 Leaving the Roblinsee we cut across the fir woods to the canal.   Passed along the canal thru' Steinmuhlhavel, where  the usual locks worked the usual mill.   The village is quite small;  about a dozen cottages and not even a store.
