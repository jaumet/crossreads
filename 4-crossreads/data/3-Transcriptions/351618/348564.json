<p>Spoke to Capt Keith Miller Chaplain 7th L Horse.<br/>Wednesday 7th July\A quiet morning. Weather still hot and flies as bad as ever.</p>
<p>Just a bit of Prose I put together to-day.</p>
<p>Australian Boys rough rugged and true<br/>To their Empire call they bravely came<br/>Adding from [Indecipherable] to the grand old day<br/>[Indecipherable] veterans renowned whom we all [Indecipherable]<br/>Were never beaten in the ages long ago</p>
<p>Away sailed our boys in Khaki so great<br/>For Earths Sunny clime across the mighty deep<br/>They trained for months with every satisfaction<br/>Where it seldom rains and the [Indecipherable]<br/>Amid the scorching sandy desert plains</p>
<p>Orders to move were hailed with delight<br/>Hurrah Hurrah They cried with all their might.<br/>It meant farewell to the desert plains<br/>The heat, the flies and other pests<br/>To put our boys to a more serious test</p>
