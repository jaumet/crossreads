<p>Perham Downs : cloudy : reveille 4.30 am : packed up &amp; fell in : V.D. inspection : marched off &amp; got in train at Tidworth : out at Southampton &amp; rested on wharf : very interesting to watch the repair work in the large dry dock : went on board the Archangel &amp; pulled out : stayed in stream all night &amp; landed on wharf</p>
<p>Tuesday May 22nd</p>
<p>Again next morn : boarded boat after dinner &amp; moved off after tea : few seaplanes &amp; other escorts : our navy will do me after what a trip across the channel opens ones eyes : lay on deck to sleep :</p>
<p>Wednesday May 23rd</p>
<p>Havre : good day : marched off boat &amp; trough the town which seems a fine place : plenty of Fritzs' working on the wharf : fairly heavy march out to the camp : a large airship cruised round while we "rested" at one place &amp; looked like an immense sausage : too many in the tents so we slept under</p>
