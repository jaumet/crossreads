I wonder how recruiting is since you've heard of our toil. I hope the digging out of the men is going on - Under 21 or 22 are no good - - - - - The best that Australia can produce came with the 1st Division - they had it in the blood - - - - - Some are said to have advanced with tears streaming down their faces, as their pals fell one after another - tears of anger. The Turks got from them quicker than they did from the Bulgarians.
No rain today - beautiful Mediterannean blue: down the valley I get a glimpse on a hill side of a plateau with 3 Turkish tents still standing & a lot of clothing & things lying about: They went very soon for the 3rd Brigade ran down or slid right on top of them.
I asked mother to tell you I met Chidley - Chidley the dainty! on the beach - I admire him. - - - - -
Burdett is detached from me - he is orderly officer to the Lt. Col. (L.H.) who is permanent Commandant of our Post: but is well.
