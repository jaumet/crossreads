  
 21st. Aug. Received instruction to fire the heavy gun between the hours of 1.30 and 2.30 p.m.  Sent Lt. PINDER and telephonist up to prepare the gun and lay the line. Went up myself and commencer firing at 1.40. Found line cut to O.P. I observed three shots the third of which went right into Mouquet Farm. The burst of the 240mm shell can be distinguished from all other bursts by its greater height and the tremendous amount of earth and stones it throws up.  I then returned to the gun and we fired 5 more rounds, when we received a note stating that some of our shells were falling near our infantry trenches. The concussion from the gun, when fired is tremendous, in a covered in pit or dug-out. The place is filled with dust, the ground shakes and large pieces fall from the walls. This was the first time that we had used the No 31/24 D.A. fuse. It was successful. The Huns were putting a few shells over but there was no intense bombardment. Our infantry made an attack at 6 p.m. and gained their objective.  DAILY MAIL report- Gradually the British troops are pushing nearer to Theipvalle. In LEIPZIG SALIENT yesterday they advanced to within a thousand yards of the town, while near Pozieres they made considerable progress, advancing on a front of half a mile and establishing themselves just outside Mouquet Farm which is almost due east of Theipvalle and overlooks it. Trenches were also taken south of MARTINPUICH.  Had as enjoyable gallop to WARLOY 
 22nd Nothing 
 23rd Went to see Major Paul up SAUSAGE GULLY. I am not feeling at all fit, nerves are not nearly so good as they were. Guns firing around cause me considerable annoyance. 
 24th I am appointed Temporary D.T.M.O. while Captain ASHER is away wounded. The troops on our right and left made an attack during the night on points near Thiepval and obtained many prisoners. 
 25th Received instructions to put guns in Quarry, and I went up with Mr.Hirst to explore the position. There was not a great deal of shelling. On the top of the ridge over which KAY trench passes there are dozen or so of men killed apparently while trying to dig a new trench. This particular part is very dangerous and there are old and new remains of dead bodies scattered about.
