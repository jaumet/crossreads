Well we were very busy today looking around for old bags pieces of timber ect. to see if we could make a sort of shelter to sleep under as we did not have any tents any how we managed to dig up a few bags & made a very good one. "Cairo" is about 6 to 8 miles away but it dont take long in the tram. The "Pyramids" are quite close to us just behind the camp. they look like huge mountains how ever in the name of goodness they built them I would like to know. they are wonderful. no mistake. I got some of my English money changed in Egyptian money talk about money for a 1 I got a pocket full but goodness only knows I dont. for he may have only gave me 10/- or 15/- worth any way I cant argue with them, for I dont no one coin from another.
