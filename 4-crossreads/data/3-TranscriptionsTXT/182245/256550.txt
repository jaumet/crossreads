 FEBRUARY 1917 
 4 SUNDAY 
 Fine &amp; Sunny. I was on sick 
 parade in morning for my 
 throat, &amp; got a gargle for it. 
 Went out to Bac St Maur in 
 a spring cart with Cyril [Rhohu?] 
 for canteen stores in afternoon. 
 There was a church parade 
 in morning &amp; some of our 
 fellow went. Very quiet 
 all day, hardly any guns 
 going at all.
