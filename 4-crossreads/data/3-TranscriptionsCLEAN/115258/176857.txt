  
 The photo was sent me by a chap in hospital and was found on a German and is supposed to be of Armenians being hung by Turkish officers. It is not a nice photo and I'm not sending it home for my collection. I went over yesterday afternoon and saw Jim Leask; I was at Fort St with him you know, we went to that Rural camp together and he was a signaller in this regt till he got his com in the 11th. I reckon he was one of the finest soldiers and straightest man I know. he was badly wounded the other day and cut off by the turks, and it is a marvel how he got in and lived but he looks wonderfully well on it now and hopes to go home to Australia. His people live in Mosman and I think Aunt Min knows them. His only other brother was killed in France. Dont think there is any more news now Father, I will try and write again in a day or two when Mother's parcel comes, or if my photos are ready to send. It must be great for the Jelarah people having Geoff home again. Hope Hal likes the Uni? Wonder if they have him on cutting up frogs yet? Love to Mother & Hal and Fred. I am your loving son Robert C Wilson 
 P.S. Re the enclosed photo Please dont let it be put in the paper, as the negative belongs to some other chap and I was just given a print so the photo is not really mine.
