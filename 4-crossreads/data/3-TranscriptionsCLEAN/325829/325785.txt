for their gallant conduct during the operations on March 23rd. [this phrase appears in the diary at the top of Page 15 - it was inserted in the wrong place by Smith][marked as page 14a by Price]On April 19th the 2nd Brigade moved across the Jordan early in the morning on reconnaissance work. The 5th Regt being in advance with the 7th on our right & the 6th in support.
We were under one of the heaviest shell On this day the Regt experienced the heaviest shelling it had ever been subjected to. An artillery officer on observation estimated that over 4000 shells were "hurled" at us, of every calibre up to 5.9 the 77mm predominating. There was absolutely no cover except thick thorn bush which impede our movements, & barely acted as a screen from the enemy. Shell after shell burst amo9ng the troops, but owing to the soft nature of the ground, the effect was very local, & very little damage was done. Among other things it demonstrated what a lot of lead it takes "to kill a man". The morale of our troops under this heavy fire which lasted all day was splendid. Our casualties were slight 2 killed & 4 O.ranks wounded, but we lost several horses. The Regt withdrew at dusk across the Jordan to its previous site.
