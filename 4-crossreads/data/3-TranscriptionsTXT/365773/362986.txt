For two nights I didnt go to bed at all - I wouldn't have missed seeing London go mad for a Kings ransom - the streets were of course lighted up again & people were marching round in processions flying flags playing weird instruments singing & cheering - at about lam that night another Captain & myself were caught up by a big procession in the forefront of which were Australians, we were hoisted shoulder high given Aussie flags & to the tune of "Australia will be there" we paraded around Trafalgar Suare.The Colonel & I went away for a week end for a spell on the 15th the pace being too hot, we returned to London on the 18th & came straight on to here. More about this when I see you. You might shew Mother & the Dad this letter please, with fondest love from your loving brotherbest love to B & Ralph
