Amb for mail but nothing doing. They forwarded me

Very little doing today. An awfully trying day, with plenty of sand Got news of the North Sea Battle mostly in favour of Germans. Went round and saw Edric for a few minutes tonight as we are supposed to be leaving tomorrow. The 8th Brigade Infantry which we cover has all its stuff on the train ready for moving

Our moving has been postponed again. They called in our blankets this morning and had to give them out again. The 8th Brigade had to unload all their stuff. I think they must fear that German boats have got out. We were paid today, fortunately and are not supposed to be leaving now until the 15th We are all greatly disgusted naturally.
