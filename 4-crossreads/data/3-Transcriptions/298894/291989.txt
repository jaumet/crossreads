<p>to keep us warm<br/>Sunday 7th struck trouble this morning. I, with several others fell in on parade with the top button of our coats undone &amp; we picked out &amp; put on a fatigue as punishment. This consisted of filling in old latrines. The whole corp was however put on pitching new tents in place of the existing ones &amp; there was plenty of work to do. I managed to get about 14 lbs of potatoes  &amp; a tin of gooseberry jam from a  tent nearby. I could not tell whether they were left by the outgoing men or not but gave myself the benefit of the doubt &amp; took them. In the afternoon I went across to my friend at No2 to get some films being developed for me also to get some backsheesh goods It was a most successful trip &amp; I brought back a bottle of wine, 8 candles, tea sugar, tin of milk &amp; a plate, coming back I waded across the lagoon but the surface of the water had a film of Grease on it with the result that I received a good coating of grease on my legs &amp; I had to walk home &amp; wash it off before I could get dressed again.Monday 8th More tent pitching in the morning. In the afternoon</p>
