April May 19175th   The weather has been very sultry to-day & this afternoon we had a thunder storm with heavy rain, the first I have seen of its kind for a long while.  The school is starting on Monday & we are to change our quarters to make room for the men coming in to it.6th   This morning we packed up & moved to a new billet about 1/2 a Kilometre away where we aught to be comfortable.As usual we had the afternoon off & with a couple of others I rode into ? a village about 6 Kms. away.The scenery is very beautiful around here & is thouroghly apprecated after what we have had of late.
