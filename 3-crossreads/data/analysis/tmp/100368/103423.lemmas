The motor car was all deck off with greeneri , especi the wheel of the car . We understood it to be the drive home of a newli marri coupl go to their new home . The whole process was follow by a crowd of youngster cheer and shout at the pitch of their voic . There were a great mani soldier and nurs pass at the time and a look of amus cross their face as the humour of the scene dawn upon them . While this scene was be enact a contrast to the happi pictur was also wit in the pass of a nativ funer with it accompani groan and chant as they follow the corps to the cemeteri . Go home from the church in the gloam we were rather tickl by see a drove of duck be driven along one of the main street , by some nativ . Juli 6th Mon . The view look from the balconi of number 6 ward strike one veri much . The Bulac Bridg , a peculiar kind of drawbridg , cross the River Nile at this part . There is a veri great deal of traffic over the bridg , tram car which go backward and forward from Cairo to the Great Pyramid , Motor Car , cyclist , nativ ride their camel donkey , and drive their cart , continu cross all day long . The bank of the Nile are line with tree and the white glare of the hot sun give the River a blue , calm refresh appear . The gaili colour steamboat , houseboat , etc give the place a holiday appear . The continu come and go of the larg felucca carri merchandis , fruit , stone , etc give a strang mysteri to the scene . On the other side of the bridg the citi of Cairo begin , it flat roof hous some gaili colour , other the colour of clay , the numer dome and minaret of the mosqu rise abov the hous continu until they gradual reach the Citadel and Moham Ali mosqu which are built high up on the hill , while behind this mosqu rise the Mokattam Hill which have a white lime appear . More wound arriv from the Dard , late to-night . Tue Juli 7th Went down the Mouski along with O ? N. In the even went for a stroll along an unknown road . It was in the gloam and a nice cool breez was blow which was veri refresh after the extrem heat of the day . I was surpris to find this road all line with tree and it was just like the terrac and avenu at home . Juli 9th More wound from the " Dard " . Juli 12th Intend to have a sail up the River Nile with M. but much to our disappoint we could not get a boat to hire so we decid to go out to Heliopoli . We had a walk round this beauti place which is built out in the desert . Return to the citi we had tea in Groppi 's and then drove home in a "gharri " . Juli 16th D and myself were pick to go on a Hospit Ship . There were twenti men pick and the remain twenti five were ask to volunt . The result was a great deal more volunt than were requir . We were put through a medic test and told to keep ourselv in readi . We thought our "luck was in " this time . Juli 19th More patient from the Dard . Went to the Aquarium which is onli a short walk from here . The ground are veri nice laid out . In the centr is a larg Ghrotto . It is nice and cool insid and in nich swim about in water , the various kind of fish which are to be found in the River Nile . Juli 22nd O?N and myself went into town on an A.S.C. Waggon and got off at the Cairo Station . Make our way down a narrow street in order as O?N said to ?lose ourselv ? for the afternoon we wander on " all dress up and nowher to go" . We walk slowli along accost as we went , nativ seller , speak to them in broken Arabic and by this mean ad more to our few Arabic word . As we wander about we got an insight into the work-a-day life of the nativ . We saw them make the cage-lik bed made from the branch of the Palm Tree , the same as the one which we at present sleep on . We saw an old man turn wood by a veri clever devic in the form of a hand lath . It was turn by mean of a bow , the string of the bow be put round the articl to be turn . The rapid by which this old man turn these articl with this ancient devic was marvel . As we pass a larg window we saw a larg number of nativ with watch in front of them . Think this place to be a watchmak shop we went in to see the time . We were greet with a roar of laughter by about thirti men and boy seat at tabl like the desk in a school . Much to our surpris and amus we found that this was not a watchmak shop but a place where they were make hand-mad cigarett . Each person there had a watch in front of him and the tick , tick , tick , of these thirti watch seem to act like music to the nimbl finger of the cigarette-mak as they push the cut-tobacco through the alreadi prepar cigarett paper . We saw two nativ girl grind corn by hand , turn the old fashion grind stone . Other industri nativ we saw at work were men sew decor on tent , make toffe , bookbind , make the cart wheel for the nativ cart . We ultim land into well known territori " the Mouski " and got back home in time for tea . 23rd Juli , Fri . 24th Juli Sat . Had a stroll round some more of the nativ street in Cairo with the same interest experi which I had in my previous meander . 25th Juli , Sun . The season of " Ramadan " is at present be held . Hear that the interior of the Moham Ali Mosqu would be light up this even , when we knock off duti we took tram to the Citadel , to see what it would be like . Unfortun we had struck the wrong even and apart from the electr light which outlin the tall minaret of the mosqu noth except was to be seen . Go round to the lookout behind the mosqu we had a good view of the numer minaret of the mosqu of the citi of Cairo , outlin by the Electric light , like the minaret of the Moham Ali Mosqu . Juli 26th Mon . Went out for a drive in an Arabiah along with M to visit Old Cairo and the Tomb of the Mamaluk . On our way we light at the most Ancient Mosqu in Egypt . The mosqu cover a wide area and had 365 pillar of marbl , near all differ style . They had been taken from various place all over Egypt . We were told by the guid that at present onli one servic is held each year in this mosqu . We mount the narrow , short , but steep staircas up to the pulpit . It was rather shaki and thick with dust as if it had never been use for age . One part of the mosqu was cover in and had a much better appear than the other part which was left uncov . We were told that the cover in part of the mosqu was for the rich peopl and the other part , not cover in was for the poorer class . We were next taken to an old church and underneath the church was a cave which was said to have associ with the Holi Famili in their flight to Egypt . Drive further on we pass a place where excav were be made and where there were a great mani remain of build . Pass these remain we came to what appear to be a villag without an inhabit . It was a nativ cemeteri . Those peopl who could afford it build wall round their burial ground as memori , just like a cottag without a roof . The poorer peopl had to be content with less elabor burial place . We ultim reach the tomb of the Marmaluk . There were a great mani tomb , some of a rather crude appear and other were built of solid marbl and beauti carv . There is said to be over 500 tomb at this place . I was veri interest in the carpet which cover the floor of the beauti place where the massiv marbl Tombston were . It resembl veri much the carpet woven in the C.C.W. Juli 28th Wed . Went up to the Mokattam Hill . We took the Tram Car to the Citadel , then we hire a donkey to climb the steep part of the hill . There was no sign of veget on the hill , noth but sand , sand , was to be seen . One got a splendid view of the cours of the River Nile by the tree and the veget which grew along the bank of the river . Juli 30th Fri . Went over to Rodah [Rhoda ] Island to see the Nilomet . This is the place where the rise and fall of the River Nile is measur . O?N and myself had some difficulti in find the place due to the fact that the nativ , of whom we enquir , not know the languag . They were of the poorer type who had not come in contact with the troop veri much . We ultim got on the right track by the help of a nativ policeman who got the hold of a littl nativ boy . The boy guid us through a labyrinth of a way which at one time appear to have been a splendid garden . He interest us veri much by point out various tree , call them by their English name and also their Arabic name . After a good long walk through these garden we came to the Nilomet . This place was like a huge well with a pillar in the centr . The pillar was mark with Arabic measur . This well was connect in some way with the river and by this mean the rise and fall of the river was gaug . It is said that Mose was found amongst the bulrush at this part . We were then taken to the Mundura Tree . It was situat in anoth part of the garden . This tree is said to have curat power . It was all tie up with piec of rag . These rag are suppos to have been taken from the cloth of peopl who have been suffer from some diseas . The peopl are said to take piec of cloth from of the affect part . These are hung on the tree and leav from off the tree are taken and put on the part were the cloth has been taken off and also a new piec of cloth abov the leav . This tree grew in a peculiar manner . The trunk had grown parallel with the ground , then took it natur form and grew upward . Hang from the tree were numer small flag which were a great deal the wors of the wear . There were also three lamp presum for night time . On our way to this tree we were follow by a merri group of youngster . They play round about us and when we reach the tree a piec of straw mat was produc and we were request to sit on it much to the amus of the littl nativ children . Juli 31st Sat Went into Cairo this even . As we enter the Squar , the Citi Fire Engine with the Fire Brigad came dash along the street . We turn in the direct the Fire Brigad had taken . It was onli a short walk to the scene of the conflagr . When we reach the scene there was a larg crowd of peopl most soldier stand and the Fire Brigad seem unabl to do anyth . They appar were held back by the troop . The flame were blaze away on the lower flat of one build onli , when we reach the scene . As we look on wonder when ani movement was go to be made to put out the conflagr we were amaz to see about half a dozen Australian troop come out on to the balconi of the next build hawl wardrob , bed and other household thing suitabl for burn and threw them over the balconi on to the street below , where anoth fire had been begun . They seem to be as calm and collect as if they were do an ordinari day work under ordinari condit . In fact after they had thrown a larg number of thing over in this way one of the soldier had the audac , in spite of the fact that the flame were begin to mount higher and higher and volum of smoke were pour forth from the window , to give a speech to the huge crowd which had gather . The smoke and the flame becam too much for them and they left the balconi but still no effort seem be be made by the fire brigad , who , with their fire engin stood in amongst the crowd unabl to move . I saw one woman be carri out from amongst the crowd bleed from head to foot . She was put into an ambul . Befor the fire brigad got set to work five three to five stori hous were well on their way to be burn out . In one sens it would not have matter much if the whole street of hous had be burn out . It was a street of hous of ill-fam , a street , the occup of which have been the ruin of thousand of our soldier live . Even in the open street one could see thing which unless they had seen them with their own eye , they would not have believ that white peopl could have sunk so low and becom so degrad . Aug 1st Sun . Went and had a look at the work of the previous night . Noth but the bare wall of five hous were left to mark the spot where the previous morn peopl had live . A guard was put over the street and no one was allow to pass through . Aug 2nd Mon . More patient from the Dard . Most medic case .

One part of the island is laid out for build purpos . Fine avenu have been made with tree on either side which point to this place be a veri fashion place some time . Get off the well laid out part on to a footpath we came to the bank of the River Nile . We came across what we thought were heap of mud . On closer examin we found they were the dwell of nativ . The inhabit be worker on the land . Cattl , donkey poultri and peopl live in much the same place . The nativ poultri like their egg are veri small and the nativ cattl are veri ugli look beast . Felucca were sail up this branch of the river which went to form the island . Three nativ who had practic no cover over their bodi were walk along the bank pull a larg felucca down the river . In their work the nativ seem to be veri spare dress , but I have often been walk on the road lead to the citi and have been hail by them and had to look twice befor recogn them .

This time I had a guid book with me and with the inform contain in it and see the actual thing I spent an exceed pleasant afternoon . It was veri cool insid the Museum . The place is massiv built . The more I look at the Statu , Tomb Sarcophagus , etc the more I was impress with the wonder life-lik express of the featur , in spite of the fact that they were bad mutil and had suffer from the ravag of time , some of them were thousand of year old and had lain for centuri cover by the sand . The hieroglyph on some of the tomb are so neat carv that one cannot prais them enough . There were mummi , thousand of year old , the ancient jewelleri they wore , etc . and mani other thing use in the live of these ancient Egyptian which could onli draw from us the conclus that they must have been a wonder race of peopl at that time . It was a most profit afternoon that we spent here to-day . To learn all that was to be seen in this place would take up a life time of studi . On leav the Museum and make our way toward the Hospit , three nativ appar took us for simpleton . As we approach them they began to play with three card . One of them put the three card down on the ground whilst the other two back for the highest card . In spite of the fact that I knew that they were tri to influenc us to play , we were almost on the point of put money on the card so simpl did it seem . The old man of the trickster did thing so sheepish and yet won near everi time , that , had n't we known anyth of the game we would have fallen into the trap and prove what they thought us to be , name simpleton . As we walk away we burst out laugh and likewis the nativ did also when they saw that we knew their game . Saw the nativ lay the foundat stone of a minaret at the re-build of an old mosqu . These nativ seem to still do their work without the aid of mechan impliment . This old mosqu which was bad out of repair was said to be five hundr year old . Aug 9th Mon Went down the " Mousky" .
