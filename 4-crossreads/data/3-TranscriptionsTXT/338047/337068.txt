We bought some good fruit & walked around the shops & pier.  I bought two crocodilite charms (one of which I now wear on my watch chain) & a bead necklace.  We came back to the boat about 10 pm.
July 27Next day 27th July we got leave from 10 am.  The Port Melbourne was waiting on coal which had not arrived to time.  We sat on the pier & went up onto the pier tower & surprised a young lady who was having a quiet smoke on her own.  We then went through the gardens.
