cameras. J Cook followed with a few well chosen words and I then called for 3 cheers for Australia coupled with the names of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy. After this the field officers fell out for an introduction and General Birdwood asked me to allow the men to march off which I did. Had a long talk about general matters to Generals Monash and Birdwood and then took leave of Hughes and Cook who sailed away in their cars. Now returned home along very dirty roads and met Dick Dowden. After mess went down to the General tapped him for leave. He poured out his many troubles into a sympathetic ear. Returned then to my H.Q. there to receive Dowden and hear a long recital of his! Rode off at 10 pm for the front line
