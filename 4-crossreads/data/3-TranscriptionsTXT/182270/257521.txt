MONDAY, JULY 28, 1919.
Rained nearly all day. I went
into town early. Saw Kemmis
re plans and he is calling for
ammended tenders with certain
things cut out. Clyde came home
& I had lunch with Marj., Olga, &
he at the Wentworth. Met Linda
and [Sleepy?] at Farmers for afternoon
tea, also Bobbie McMillan.
We got home for dinner.
