this evening and to night.
Thursday May 17.1917A cloudy wet morning.  There is a decided change in the weather, & it has all appearance of continuing showery for some time.There was some artillery activity last night on the right of Ploegsteert.The German Chancellor has delivered his speech in the R.  There is very little in it, but many high sounding words and phrases, and offers a separate peace to Russia on German terms couched in vague language.  He declares Germany's peace terms to France & England remain the same as usual.
