<p>Thursday 30th</p>
<p>We had a try out over the desert with full packs up doing about 8 or 9 miles.  The going was firm &amp; pleasant so experienced no difficulty except a severe dust storm which sprang up &amp; quite shut out everything further than 10 yds from us.  The following day was spent packing up loading wagons &amp; in general preparing for our departure the following morning.  At night I went along to a visiting circus &amp; thoroughly enjoyed the show.  It was much as others but some child performers were wonderful riding horses standing up etc one was aged about 3 &amp; the other 5 &amp; it was really cruel to have them showing, tumbling, clown acts etc completed a very fair bill.</p>
