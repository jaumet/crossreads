<p>Trench routine, carrying water, going on fatigues, etc.</p>
<p>Was in charge of a guard of three last night. The Ghurkas attached &amp; made a slight advance. Slept in a dugout part of the night &amp; a trench the rest. Stray bullets kept giving you a cold feeling down the small of the back, as we are right behind the fire trench &amp; as most of the bullets go high in the night our trench gets a rough time after dark.</p>
