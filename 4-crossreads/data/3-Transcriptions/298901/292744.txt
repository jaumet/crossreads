<p>amongst other news.</p>
<p>Thursday 20th June<br/>Very quiet during the day but had 50 through last night.  Spent some time fixing up a blanket store etc so had a busy day myself.  A little rain later in the day kept the mud going.  News of Austrian offensive fair, the Italians are doing well &amp; holding them which also points to the fact that the Austrians are not fighting well which looks hopeful</p>
<p>Friday 21st June<br/>Wet &amp; fine throughout the day.  Very little doing except sick. Italians holding well &amp; claims 9000 prisoners not bad for the defensive.  But I wish that we also had the Austrians to deal with</p>
<p>Saturday 22nd June<br/>Very quiet &amp; wrote several letters.  One of our best men Harry Fleischmann D.C.M. was killed yesterday, one of the bravest of the brave &amp; we had two men wounded.  Had word through that I have received the M.S.M. but it has not come through officially.</p>
