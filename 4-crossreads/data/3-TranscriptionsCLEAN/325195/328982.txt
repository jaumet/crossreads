25.10.15Mon 25thI was expecting to see Roy Forsyth with this lot of reinforcements but I find he is a Sergeant in the 7th & as the 7th left Aus after the 8th they still take second place: there was no one in this lot that I know; Peters H Q Signaller went off duty to-day & Nelson is now doing duty; Reid is a permanent C-Sqd Signaller from now on in Stans place; Some mighty big shells were thrown at the beach about 8 oclock tonight, & by the sound of them they had come a long distance as they appeared to be travelling very slow when they arrived, & we could hear no report of the gun; Our patrols have silencers on their rifles in case they meet a Turkish patrol
