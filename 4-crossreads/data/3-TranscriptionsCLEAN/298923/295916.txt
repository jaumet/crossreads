  
 7 September 1918 Saturday   (X to X crossed out) Thermometer has been over 100 everyday but much cooler than the past month! Gift stuff from N.S.W. Comfort Fund arrived today & as we have plenty of water we are O.K.  Did I tell you what happened to A.J.C. gifts on July 14: the Germans got them from the 2nd LH & then we took them back again. X A consignment of BEER has also arrived I am a great believer in letting the men get good "grog" better than [indecipherable] buying poisonous KONIACK of the country.X
