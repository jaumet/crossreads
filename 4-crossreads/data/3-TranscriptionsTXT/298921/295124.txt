June, 1915Wednesday 2Saw the IsherwoodS off to England today - Father daughter & daughter in law whose Husband is in the Lancashire B F. Artillery - I have known these people & had many pleasant nights together - I am writing separately to tell you in confidence more about the above which will be better to keep in the family for the present, but I hope to meet them again some day.
