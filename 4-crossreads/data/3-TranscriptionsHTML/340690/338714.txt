<p>Supposed to go out at 9 with Sarre but afterwards altered and to go out myself to camouflage Edmond's job but with Sarre's help got a private from infantry party who was very windy and scared by attack on right which he thought was at 12.30 and came off at 6 or 7 in morning.  Was going out but saw Jensen &amp; had to go back to get camouflage from Battalion.  Hard to get up and Major on job and some shelling.  Major rather in a bad temper &amp; tried to show me my job.  Spent until about 12.30 putting in stakes by myself.  Infantryman no good at all.  Rest knocked off at 12.30 &amp; I thought of getting more camouflage but shelling very heavy in forward area so came home.  Met Linton in trench towards R.A.P. which was being shelled and rode home on bikes.  Fairly quiet when we reached home.  Artillery getting considerably livelier.  No shell near here though.</p>
<p>28.6.18<br/>Up after dinner and in aftn. had a bath and washed some clothes.  Also wrote more letters in evening too.  Barrage on right very heavy and heavy till dinner time.  About 7 o'clock shelling very heavy with a number of guns towards Pradelles &amp; round batteries and roads.  Out at 9 although not warned till late to go out section who had already gone so out with Reid &amp; Edmonds.  Met rest at Battn.  No parties at all so all went out to Forward Battn. H.Q.  Some 8" shells fell near road and busted wire this side of Pradelles searching for 6" battery.</p>
