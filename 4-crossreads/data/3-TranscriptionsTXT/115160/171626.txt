Dear Bessie,
I am so very sorry to have to put your visit off from next Sunday as I have been waiting for you to come up here quite a long time now.
But we always go to my sisters' place at Ashfield the Sunday before Xmas day, so I do hope you will not mind, but if you will just drop me a line & let me know what other time will suit you after Sunday I will promise to keep that day clear for you.  I did not answer your letter sooner Bess, as I have been trying to put our visit off but could not manage it.
I was very sorry to hear that your Mum was not well again, but hope she is much better ere this.  How is your head now. Strange to say I had a terrific headache these last days as well and even today it is not right.
Well, Bessie  my dear, I will manage to slip in to see you before or on Xman eve whichever day I may be in town.  
Give my love to your dear Ma & take heaps for your own dear self 
I am with your loving friend,
Ethel xxx
