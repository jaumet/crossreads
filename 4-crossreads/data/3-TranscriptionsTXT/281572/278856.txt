Six of us and an NCO were detailed to No 7 post.  This was probably the worst post of the lot.  It was well forward in no-man's land, and was simply a bay in an uninhabitable trench, in very low country.  This trench is known as Bayonet trench, and is directly opposite the remains of Gueduecourt, where the 1st Aust. Div. had done some very fine work on a previous occasion.  This was evidenced by the number of dead around.  One rather swollen Fritz used to trip every new patroll which approached us from our rear.  It's a nasty thing to stumble over, human remains at night.  The trip "in"  this time was one of the worst &ndash; to me at any rate.  Incessant drizzling rain had made the mud worst than ever, if that were possible.  At any rate it was more tenatious lower under the watery surface.

The mud and small fragments of shell, called " Blighties"  fell in showers.  Now and again a ping on a steel helmet reminded us of the value of these hats.  The noise was deafening, and the smell of the shell gas stifling.  It was a nice Christmas greeting, a true piece of "hate" .  We sat tight and
