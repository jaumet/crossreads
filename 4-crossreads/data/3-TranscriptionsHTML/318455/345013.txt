<p>as I have heard also bombs.</p>
<p>May 23<br/>Still camped on the outskirts of Sylvestre Cappel &ndash; have nothing to write about just waiting (that is what we all feel) for Fritz's next big effort. We are having moonlight nights &amp; Fritz is doing a lot of night bombing round about here &ndash; varied with long distance shelling &ndash; he put half a dozen big shrapnel over the village last night.</p>
<p>From a small party, some 12 of them &ndash; German prisoners brought down a week ago I got a ration of their army bread. Black, sodden looking &amp; most unpalatable stuff</p>
