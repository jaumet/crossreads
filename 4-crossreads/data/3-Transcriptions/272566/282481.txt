<p>Wednesday 7 February</p>
<p>Unexpectedly informed that I could go on leave tonight, and was given about 15 minutes to get ready.  Had to report at Albert Station at 6 p.m. to catch a train leaving at 9.30 p.m.  We were fortunate in getting a hospital train.  Tea is made on the "Kitchen Car" and served out whilst the train is in motion.</p>
