<p>1916 April 21 <br/>Good Friday</p>
<p>Still strong gale but sea not so rough. No hot cross buns. Nothing decent on this old tub. Given up expecting it.<br/>All awnings taken down. Sun hot tho' wind cool. Barns dreadfully. Poor nurse suffered. Douglas Rock lighthouse visible this evening. 300 miles more to go</p>
