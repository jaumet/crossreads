they were out of Sight. While Tea was on a humming Sound could be heard & on looking up a large number of Aeroplanes could be seen flying in a South Eastern direction. I counted 12 in all & they were very high up & looked grand gliding along so gracefully no doubt they were out Scouting for Fritz.Monday 11th 1917Orders came out that we would depart at 8 am next Morning for our permanent Headquarters. All day we were loading up equipment & stores into trucks over in the Railway Yards. After Tea I went into the Village to buy a few articles & went around to say Good Bye to some French People who I was introduced to by a Belgian Sergeant. These people have an  Orchard of 5 acres under cultivation which unfortunately is sadly neglected for want of labour cherries & Pear are in abundance also strawberry, Raspberry & Gooseberry bushes everywhere. Having spent 2 hours I said Good Bye & thanked them for the kindness they have extended to me. I made my way back to Camp to took up my duties for the last time.
