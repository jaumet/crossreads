<p>night, all wet &amp; covered in mud from the trenches. One fellow who had his cheek nearly blown away, but very cheery, said how long will it take before I'm at them again &ndash; this is a nice Souvenir, just 12 months married today. 3 other lads unconscious from Gas. One fellow was shot in the groin by a snipper &ndash; said just going on Guard when the blighter got me. Took a walk while slack about midnight &amp; followed the horse shoe of the trenches by the flash of the star shells &amp; guns &ndash; it is hard to realize what war in reality is &ndash; but when you are forced to believe that your turn may be next, it is almost nerve wrecking &ndash; Some of the wounds nearly turned me up &amp; it proves that a man can stand a devil of a lot of the Huns. The Boys that fell were buried quietly nearby. At our Billet in the Village in the backyard along with others lies Pte S H Schroeder &ndash; 9th Battalion 3rd Brigade A.I.F.</p>
<p>13/7/16  Thursday</p>
<p>Very cold day &ndash; A Party of us took rations to our lads in the trenches &ndash; The Boys still coming in freely, all slight clean cases today.</p>
