 Went to MER  &amp; to EU. Mer on the sea much like le Treport &amp; is very nice. EU is a big place &amp; very clean. Had a look at the big church there &amp; just after coming out from it Dinney Shearer came along on a charabanc, so went back to Le Treport with him. He &amp; I went up to the 2nd General Hospital &amp; had a talk to two or three wounded Aussie officers there. Rained all day &amp; spoilt a good night away. Left there about 7.30 &amp; missed rain all the way. Gee we were lucky tho.
