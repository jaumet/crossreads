Here 'tis a perpetual drought, but the climate is lovely from an aerial point of view, &amp; irrigation makes the Mud of Egypt yield abundantly.<br/>Del Butler appeared to me to be a refined young woman, and her Mother impressed me very favourably. Good!  I hope that you enjoyed the races. Girls are sweet who are particular in speech and tasteful in dress.<br/>I posted a letter to Mr Neil Macdonald yesterday.  He is very kind as are the members of his family.  I hope that you will not let the rooms as bedrooms.  People sleeping on the premises are a nuisance &amp; you should have enough money to manage with.  Maria in best form would make the air resound from the piano while Tab &amp; Kit sewed.  Thanks for your big prayer.  I say some daily for you.  Good Night.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Tabby dear:/<br/>My best wishes to Dr Kelty.  He had a pleasant trip I hope.  It was mean of Dr. Dunn to leave my rooms, but it cannot be helped.  I am sure that you will manage all right.   But dont let the rooms as bed rooms if you can help, it is not convenient or nice to have people in the house at night.<br/>Monsignor OBrien. R.I.P.   He was a good looking man, &amp; a gentleman in every fibre.<br/>A letter from Ted is amongst my bundle tonight, it will be opened later. Good man Ted.  Tell him McGee near Hunter St, in Castlereagh St cuts my hair in Sydney.   The Australians</p>
