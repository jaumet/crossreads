  
 here because then we do not hear those huge Gothas roaring overhead looking for likely possies to lay their eggs, while we are shivering & quaking below. At Querrieu every clear night is like a Battle between Bombs, Antiaircraft guns, Machine guns, & every Swaddy who has a little spare ammunition having a go on his own. We left Querrieu with a party of Carpenters including myself to start a new Dump near Vignacourt today. 
 Tuesday 16/4  I have been with Sgt Wilson these last few days. He is a member of the Westralian Labour Party. He looks like a mascot being only about 5 Feet high. One of his Sons   are   is buried at Bernafay Wood. Another has been horribly wounded and returned to Australia. I hurt his feelings very much by a remark that I made about the wounded one. 
 Bobs grave is behind Fritzs lines now. The Indians over here have to be buried with their heads to the west so they may face the East. In a Cemetary alongside here one of them had to be buried outside so that this rule could be observed 
 17/4  Vignacourt is now full of French Soldiers they have come from Lorraine where the 66th U.S.A. Division relieved them. Like the rest of the French people they cannot get Tobacco & hang around our Canteens asking us to buy Cigarettes for them, because the Canteen will only serve British Troops.
