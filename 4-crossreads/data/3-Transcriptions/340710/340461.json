<p>Anzac<br/>16th June 1915.<br/>Im very lonely tonight, poor old George was badly hit with shrapnel to-day and we have never been apart for long since the Landing.  We have been living in the same dug-out, you know, with Hal and Rob next door but somehow we used to usually wander off together, we worked together, swam together, ate together and yarned and argued (sometimes furiously) and this brings men together perhaps more than anything else could do.  You know the true value of friendship.  Don't think Im getting down on it, old man, but George leaving me so suddenly and having seen death with all its awful suddeness in these last few</p>
