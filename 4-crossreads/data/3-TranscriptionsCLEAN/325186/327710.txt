  
 there we went to Blangy-Tronville a village about 3 kilos from Villers-Betonneaux.  The Battn went into the line at  Villers  B & did a stunt on 4th April.  I rejoined them again from A S. C & they were in reserve in a wood behind Villers B.  We went out cable laying on the night of 16th April & I got a dose of gas on 17th April & left the Batt went through several dressing stations  I saw nothing from the time I left the 9th F ambulance until I got to the 12th U.S A. Gen Hospital at Rouen on 19th April  I had my eyes treated here & that was about all they did to me. On 25th April I was sent to a Convalescent Camp about a mile from the Hospital
