 &amp; some of the Boys also.  Thursday weather broke lovely, the sea very calm, the boys soon recovered &amp; begin to look forward to a trip ashore at Fremantle.  Friday we sighted land about a mile away, very sandy, &amp; desolate looking but quite welcome after the water.  Saturday all eyes for Fremantle, we entered about 11.30 AM &amp; berthed in the stream at 1.30 &amp; were allowed leave till 10 PM we were taken to the wharf on launches.  Claude met his aunt &amp; cousin on the wharf  &amp; they invited me out to tea at Subiaco where we spent a very enjoyable afternoon, we then left after tea for Perth, there was a patriotic carnival on at Perth &amp; our boys enjoyed themselves.  Perth is a jolly little city it really surprised us both in size and the way they welcome anyone.  Sunday we sailed about 9.30 PM &amp; all hands were sorry to leave but the weather still remained perfect, the sea broken but no swell. 
 Monday also proved an ideal day with a calm sea.  Tuesday 11th weather still lovely and sea calm we are fast approaching the tropics.  Wednesday the sea is just like a sheet of glass, it looks unnatural to anyone who has not travelled.  Thursday sea resumed its usual broken condition, the weather being still perfect though hot.  We had a boat station drill this morning &amp; a boxing competition this afternoon which caused a bit of fun  &amp; we had a mock trial tonight.  It was fairly good considering the time at the disposal of the artist, but it would have been better if it was held on deck, (it was held in one of the wards) as it was that hot and close that we were wet through with perspiration &amp; a lot of us had to go outside long before it had finished.  Friday weather still good though hot.  Saturday we sighted Cocos Island at 8 AM &amp; sighted North Keeling at 9.30 &amp; sighted the Emden at 9.45 &amp; at 10.15 we had a good view of her, at about 3/4 mile distant, the Islands also presented a picturesque sight &amp; extra welcome, because it is the first bit of life |(with the exception of 1 bird) we have seen since leaving Fremantle.  Sunday very hot, we had church parade, we had a light shower during night.  Monday very hot, but grew muggy &amp; rainy looking
