  
 Monday 3 March 1919 Cairo Busy Cairo, lunched with Dolly at Shepheards.  Sorry Mr. Austin had gone back, never saw either, am sorry.  Tired after journey & rushing around, nothing definite re going Australia yet, but hope to remain with Dolly till I do sail.  Arranged Jim Ayre to leave his job & come with me home on same boat.
