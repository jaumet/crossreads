 JAN.    SUNDAY 23     1916 
 Very hot & muggy.  We all sat in nursrey [nursery?] all day and played the phonograph.  Bob Lawson called in about 5pm to tell us he had tried to join the Light Horse & Artillary & he had failed.  Linda & self went for a walk round the Strand scrub after he had gone.  Like those walk' e s round Strand scrub with Linda very much, as we seem to get to know one another better through the talks we have there.  Dont know why it should be but we seem to be able yarn much freer there than anywhere else.
