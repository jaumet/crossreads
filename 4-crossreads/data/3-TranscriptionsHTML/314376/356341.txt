<p>After drill in the morning the chaps would lie round and either talk, read or sleep, just as they felt inclined, there was very little in the way of fatigues to be done and only an occasional guard to furnish. This would suit me, I would go round looking for fresh "worlds to conquer" and would emerge on the Company's cook house, I asked them if they had any odd jobs to do and I would do them. As a matter of fact they did and after a time I became quite in demand amongst them. Would come down every day regular by after drill and approach them as regards work which was given</p>
