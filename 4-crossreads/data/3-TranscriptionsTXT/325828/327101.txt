It is partly for this reason that I am not on Scout machines as weight is an important factor when you need to climb to 23,000 ft.  I was disappointed at first at being put on as Corps Pilot but am quite satisfied now as my machine has & will have in future a stationary engine, much more reliable than rotaries.Must close now, with love to all at homeYour loving son,Leo.P.S. No home mail to hand for close on 2 months now.  Will probably get a budget when it starts.Leo.P.P.S. Must acknowledge with thanks the remittance for 10 that I cabled for from Wendover.  J.L.W.
