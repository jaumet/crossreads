27/2/18 Selles
A fine morning. Men down to our Battalion parade ground for bombers and there saw "D" Company carry out a rather good live bombing operation. These bombs are dreadfully shattering things. "A" Company came down afterwards and continued the practice. At 11.30 I inspected our men, horses and limbers for the horse show. They were smart in clothes and turnout but many finishing touches have yet to be made. Badges and lanyards are being fixed up for them. Young Murphy and Snowden have their horses looking very fit and well and the limbers are all shining with new paint.
