Dec 25th 11.45 Xmas day 1917 is almost a thing of the past. It has been a most miserable day. Raining nearly all the time, with thunder and lightning, and a cold biting wind. For dinner, roast meat, boiled potatoes, pudding and jelly. That is better than we expected, but the rain and cold takes the enjoyment out of everything. The Rothschild distillery people provided free wine for all the Soldiers this morning. That "Jollied " them up a bit. With what they procured elsewhere, that has kept some more than happy all day. I am on picket to night, one hour and a quarter. To morrow we leave here for the vicinity of Eshdud again. This move of course, is owing to the difficulty of transport to where we are.
I am sitting shivering in my wet overcoat to write these few lines on the edge of my bed before the morning dawns. Wet feet, wet overcoat and to top it all, wet blankets. A Happy Xmas, Oh, Yes, certainly, and a shift in the rain to morrow. I forgot to mention that my cobber (young Billy Beasant) and I to day went into the Synagogue to have a look round. It is the first time I have been inside a Jewish Synagogue. The mens seats below, are of some light wood, varnished. The womens seats upstairs are of painted deal The roof is blue and set with golden stars.
