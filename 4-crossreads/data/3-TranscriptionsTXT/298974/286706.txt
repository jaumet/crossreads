 Dear Father. 
 Yesterday I sent a civil cable (which cost 18/6) [indecipherable] [indecipherable] asking you to send &pound;10. Of course you will think all kinds of things but the fact is we have been given an opportunity of seeing a bit of England &amp; it does seem a pity now we are here not to do so. Most of the chaps brought money but I did not. After 7 weeks hard work we all drew &pound;3.15.0, so you see I would have to spend all my leave in S'hampton if I can't raise some [indecipherable] I will have to settle somehow. Love. Dene.
