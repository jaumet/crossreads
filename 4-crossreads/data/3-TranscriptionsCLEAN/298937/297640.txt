  
 Sunday 6th Aug. 
 Reached Malta at breakfast time this morning & put in at one of the harbours while the destroyer went for oil. Made a couple of rough sketches of the harbour, which is rather pretty but not interesting.  There seem to be terraces running along the hills, which, sand yellow in color, would be as glary as the desert but for splashes of green here & there. There seem to be some fine buildings on the island, isolated - away on the tops of hills. A large factory is discernable on the left branch of this harbour
