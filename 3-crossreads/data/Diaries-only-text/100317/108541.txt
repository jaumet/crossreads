Some fumes of gas could be smelt still. Returned via Mericourt station. The small civilian cemetery here has not yet been knocked about and there are a good many wooden soldier's crosses. There was one French grave with the Republican tricolour upon it. An old P.O.W. cage seems strangely out of place here. The enemy was throwing some rather heavy stuff around in the direction of Bn HQ but fortunately scored no hits.. settled down to reading etc upon return. Gorman and Burrage came up after tea and yarned for a while. The evening was very quiet and hardly a hostile shell came over. 150 men went on to the job of digging Joppa Reserve and got down well. The nights now are very short. It is not dark till 10.15 pm. Work had to cease at 2.45 pm on account of the growing light. No casualties
