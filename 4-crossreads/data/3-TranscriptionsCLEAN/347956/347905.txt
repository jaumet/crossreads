 Tue 2nd The test we had with the helio yesterday morning was wiped out & we had another test this morning with the helio.  was in communication with some signallers from the hills by the Citadel.  I believe they were from Maadi; went nowhere after tea but stayed in the tent & finished off a letter to Edie Tomlins 
 Wed 3rd Had to be on parade at 8 oclock this morning; Idleboy seemed to be sick when I saddled him, so I rode Lye's horse instead & had a rough time of it on him;  We had a hard days work, as we hard to charge for a mile or two
