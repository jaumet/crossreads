<p>The weather is becoming warmer here. I should not like to be here in summer, it does not suit me here if it would only rain now &amp; again things would be better.</p>
<p>One great thing we have here now is a place where we can get for 4 PT. a warm bath. the scheme was thought out by some enterprising Frenchman the Baths have only been open a little while it's a wonder no one thought of it before there are plenty of picture show &amp; music halls. where one sometimes has the luck to strike a good programme. also shops of all sorts where you are asked to pay 4 times the value of each article.</p>
