Saturday 26 January
Usual camp routine. A Walk to Neuve Eglise on beautiful day. Tonight I watched a P.M. on a case of alcholic poisoning. The first I have seen last I want to see.
Sunday 27 January
Nothing at all happened to-day.
It has been foggy cold all day. We move in a couple of days but only just behind Ballieul.
