  
 Sun. 28th. Nov. Snowed last night & today is bitterly cold. We will suffer here when Winter gets us properly. 
 Tues. 30th. Nov. Our "Silent Ruse" of 3 days dimension commences today. No firing to be done & no one to move about more than is necessary. I wonder if "Jacko" will come at us. 
 Sat. Dec. 11th: - Moved into firing line at "Allah" Gully relieving 7th Light horse on right Flank, 
 Sat. Dec. 18th 1915. Getting ready all day for our "historic slope"; we will be like "Anthony Hordern's" All the tracks have been marked out with spilt Flour, rice or anything white so as there will be no losing the way down to the beach. Been burning stores for the last few days & what we can't carry we are spoiling. A few weeks ago we couldn't rise a pair of dry socks & now we are putting on a fresh brand-new outfit of underclothes twice a day. Could have a new lost every minute only we are too tired to change. We have been marched up from the beach a few times a day
