<p>of which I have to [put] in pony &amp; go to[Byfleet to meet Mrs Rutson &amp; finally dine at 8 pm &amp; spend evening in the library.</p>
<p>22-5-19 (Thurs)<br/>Mrs Rutson goes to London again but leaves Harris &amp; myself a job of falling trees as we are going on the job we find several pieces of Italian marble evidently a pillar &amp; groping around find all the pieces &amp; erect the pillar</p>
<p>While working at trees the old housekeeper Cruickshank, a scotswoman who has already taken a fancy to me because I am so jovial &amp; cheery &amp; decides I must be Scotch why even my name is scotch &amp; all my good points are Scotch. She speaks of <u>our</u> folks &amp; their habits so different from the English etc. She bring lemon drink &amp; retails all the ghosts she has seen in the house the jester (responsible for rich panelling) Henry VIII, [indecipherable], Queen Anne, &amp; tells us she has actually seen the ghost of a woman in room next to mine but I do not see or hear her during my sojourn here.</p>
<p>In afternoon we row up the river Wey to Mrs Horthams who takes us over the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society. These gardens present a beautiful display of every possible kind of flower the Rhodendrons &amp; azaleas being particularly fine but taken as a whole garden is not beautiful I prefer Mrs Rutsons wilderness. The river is pretty but I prefer the wildness of the Lane Cove</p>
