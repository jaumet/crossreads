<p>Explanation No. 1.<br/>May 16th-June 7th</p>
<p>During this period I stayed at Castle Hotel Tunbridge Wells.  In accordance with instructions received I placed myself at the commands of Mr Long who had been instructed to take me round and give me every opportunity for studying his Workings.</p>
<p>I accompanied him almost daily and worked hard at acquiring knowledge of the differences, technical and other, between Australian and English production of Timber.</p>
<p>Every day spent at Tunbridge Wells being fully occupied in accordance with instructions.</p>
<p>Places and Workings visited and revisited, Squerries Park, Wychcross, Buckhurst, Faircrouch, Snapewood Wadhurst, Burnt Wood Mereworth, Hampstead, Flame Wood, Guestling, Possingworth etc.  Full notes and thorough studies made with the view to fitting myself to take over Division 14 (old number) as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I was in daily expectation, after the first few days, of commands from H.Q. which would have taken me to Wales.</p>
<p>If reference will be made to correspondence it will be seen that I was eager to take up my duties in Div. 14, and my somewhat prolonged period of innitiation at Tunbridge Well was not of my choosing, and no definite period was outlined by H.Q. at the time of my appointment.  Therefore I consider I am justified in claiming the full allowances.</p>
