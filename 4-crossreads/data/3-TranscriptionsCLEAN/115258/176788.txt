or two pairs and every body has got tons of sox now so you cant give them away; so what can a person do? Of course if we don't move much I will be able to keep them till I want them. We have nearly eaten the honey and it has been nice and has let us catch up splendidly with our Jam issue - while I think of it will you please send me a water-bag for next summer, one to hold about 11/2 to 2 quarts and to hang round a horse's neck. I found one late last summer which held really well and it was a great success those we were issued with at Romani were no good at all, took too much water to keep them going.  I wonder how Father got on about James' place - By Jove it would be great to get it - would make a dinkum "estate' out of home then. I had to put 'dinkum' in there Mother because reall would sound too much like a house and land agent you know. We are still having most beautiful weather, and it is pretty here - I really think it is too nice a place to want to get leave from - so I think I will leave it till we get to some worse camp.  Love to Father, Hal and Freddie and yourself, Mother.
I am your loving son Robert C.Wilson
