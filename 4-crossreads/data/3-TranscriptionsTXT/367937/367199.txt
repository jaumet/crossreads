 Monday 24th 
 I recieved 4 more letters today: mostly old ones.  One from Mr Nicholle of 21st May and one from Miss Wright asking me to go to a concert at Menangle.  We are under marching orders today and expect to be sent on to the regiment any day now so have not much time to write to people as we are going night and day getting ready &ndash; 
 Will you write to Miss Wright &amp; thank her for ticket. Also thank Dick for his &ndash; was going to answer it but have not time.  He asked for a photo of the boat; get the boys to give him on please. You will be able to address the letters 1st Reg. 1st Brigade now I expect but I will write and tell you for certain as soon as I get there as you never know where you will be sent till you get there.  I will meet Ronald McDonald when I get to the Rgt. Must stop now &ndash; Stella sent me some prunes in her parcel &amp; they were nice; they are good thing to send as they don't make you thirsty. Good bye Mother &amp; Father I am Your loving son Rob. Patrol work ought to be much more interesting than training in camp. We are all looking forward to going.
