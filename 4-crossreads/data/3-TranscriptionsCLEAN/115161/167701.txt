 A poor old place all in ruins, only a few miles from the last place, but decidedly more "healthy", although "he" does a good bit of "business" at night, but as there is only a small camp of huts here it does not make me so "windy", although there are no cellars here. 
 Dark nights were alright, because our searchlights could easily "get on" to him, but clear moonlight nights were not so successful.

 The retreat of the enemy has been practically continuous since the
