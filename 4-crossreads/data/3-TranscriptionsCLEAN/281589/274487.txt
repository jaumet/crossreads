  
 Freetown (Sierra Leone) at 9AM, It looks very inviting on shore, thick tropical growth, the natives are a fine built lot & very good natured. The Bay is full of shipping, 3 other transports. We were not allowed ashore. Fruit was bought by the canteen. The town is built at the foot of a mountain range, it is a fair size though straggling. Tonight a chap went swimming over the side and was carried out by the current, it is a very strong one, (about 5 knots an hour) he was picked up by natives & taken to another ship. Another chap was sitting on the potato pack when it collapsed he had about 3 bags on him, but not injured. 
 Thursday 22nd. The officers gave orders to throw potato's at the natives fruit sellers to hunt them away from the ship & then the M.P. Sergeant flourished a revolver at them they are not a nuisance. We left at 12 noon. The Auxiliary cruiser stayed behind but an armored Cruiser escorted us with the other 3 transports making 8 transports
