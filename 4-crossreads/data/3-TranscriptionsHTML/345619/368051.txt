<p>[Reverse of the above postcard]<br/>26-5-18<br/>To dearest wife<br/>Am putting the last of my English cards in here, also colors off my old coat for the kiddies, the other little thing had better be for you, as I can't cut it in half for them. I will start today and write a bit each day in my pocket book, just like a little diary of things I won't be able to write to you from France. Your husband<br/>OXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX</p>
