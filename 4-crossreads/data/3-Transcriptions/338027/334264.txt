<p>Tuesday, 1st November, 1914<br/>Cup Day in Melb, [actually 4 November 1914] terrific gale where we are, all boats faring badly.  Majority of men are sea-sick.  I went down below &amp; worked mine off.</p>
<p>On Picquet again discovered horse with colic &ndash; became worse but improved with attention.</p>
<p>Whilst asleep this afternoon our W.A. contingent joined us two troopers &amp; an escort at present I do not know the names of the cruisers.</p>
<p>P.T.O. for Sunday</p>
<p>Wednesday, November 1914<br/>In the Indian Ocean at last, we have yet to pick up the W.A. contingent.</p>
<p>Sea became rough &amp; in consequence we did not have to exercise horses first aid &amp; physical culture was the order of the day.</p>
<p>Many became sea-sick I was squeamish but not sick.</p>
<p>Our boat does not seem to pitch &amp; roll like the others especially the Pera &amp; the Armadale but she is bad enough.</p>
