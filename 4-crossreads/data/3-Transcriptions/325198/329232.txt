<p>2 February, 1916<br/>Maadi Camp<br/>Another day off with my crook leg I feel pretty well other wise except for a sore throat.  Harold hurt his ankle yesterday when he fell from the horse &amp; to day it is bunged up, he is also off duty.  Every body has to parade this after noon for some reason, Cook Batmen &amp; all.  We have our own mess orderly on now &amp; we get on a great deal better - "Cookey" from this tent has taken it on for us.  a dry old stick he is too &ndash; The other day his old horse fell with him while cantering up into line from troop [indecipherable] formation.  I thought he was hurt but he got up all smiles &amp; carried on.  To day ie the anniversary of the landing in Egypt of the 6 L.H.R. I wonder where we will be next 2 Feb</p>
