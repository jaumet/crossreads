<p>France   12-7-16<br/>Dear Father<br/>I am writing this to time so it will have to be short. I wrote a card a few days ago  I don't know if it will reach ou or not. Well I haven't seen or heard of Bert so far. I thought he would have dropped me a line but he hasent so far. I didn't get a chance to look around to see if I could find him. We are on the move now so if you don't hear from me don't worry. I will write you when I get a chance. Am feeling just O.K. We have been having a royal time lately. The fruit is getting ripe. Cherries are ripe. Needless to say we have all been doing very well on them. It seemed ages since I had tasted fruit until we came out &amp; got the cherries. We were getting about four lbs for half a franc 2d.. We are in a different place now one would hardly credit there could be such a change in the country in so short a distance. We came from a thickly populated place to what is to open country in this place. It would be very fine to have a tour through here in a car. It isn't too bad on foot even but I think one would enjoy it more in a car or behind a good pair of horses. I had a letter from Belchambers</p>
