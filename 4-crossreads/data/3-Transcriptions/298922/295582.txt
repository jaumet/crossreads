<p>Friday 28th September</p>
<p>Came aboard yesterday &amp; was given an excellent State room on the old Gallipoli boat <strike>"ARAGON"</strike> which was G.H.Q.'s ship at LEMNOS. My mate is a man <strike>Gunner Major</strike> who travelled from England in the ill-fated HUNTSEND last November. We have 200 odd officers &amp; some SISTERS on board. <strike>I only paid 6/6 a day, indulgence passage for a first class passage to ? Europe.</strike>  We don't know as a matter of fact whether we go to ITALY or MARSEILLE yet &ndash; only the Admiralty knows as plenty of TIN FISH about these days. We hope to reach LONDON by Oct. 10th with luck. <strike>The little wife will find the days long I'm afraid.</strike>  Of course we live in life belts once more &amp; are escorted by T.B.D. etc:- quite a flotilla sailed out of Alex. tonight at 5 p.m.</p>
