10p.m.:  A letter from Joe reached me today.  It was written in Sydney on the 15th Janry 1915.  She wrote that "Next day we are to visit Buddie at Strathfield, she will like to be told all about you".  The letter has taken a long time to reach me, but one is satisfied to receive one at any time.  I must reply to it at once.  Good night.
10-50p.m.  Joe's letter answered.
