Sunday 
Easy night. last night. Plenty of trench feet through. The poor fellows suffer untold agony. but this state is common now in the army. Lack of proper provision by the military authorities chiefly the cause. 
Bob Ridgway self go down to see Tony in aft. visit canteen take tea along with us. very busy. Have tea of salmon, toast, butter, pineapple round a brazier of coal. Fritz prisoners arrive fro bath. Chorus singing in dressing room. "Watch on the Rhine," Hymn of hate, quite entertaining for  hour. One cannot feel enmity against the rank file. They do not feel much different form ourselves.
