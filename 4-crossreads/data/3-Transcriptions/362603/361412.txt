<p>2.  Otto is doing well with His family.  We'll want plenty of Boys when the War is over.  We were very sorry about poor Archie Prentice.  He was a personal Friend of Ours at one time, was a Member of our Dancing Class.  I have enclosed 2 Photographs of our Grimsby Relatives.  Uncle &amp; Colin with His Youngster all taken in the backyard.  Well, I have been nowhere since I last wrote, &amp; have been very busy so have no news.  Most of the Unit have been drafted away to France on Field Work</p>
