 Sir , 
 It was with deepest regret that I learned the sad news of the death of your son at the front. 
 Captain Ferguson was the officer commanding my platoon Whilst Gallipoli, and, as one who has served under him, I wish to say that he was at all times an Officer and a Gentleman. Amongst his many other sterling qualities, he at all times shoed a kindly interest for his men, being ever anxious for their welfare. 
 You have my sincere sympathy in your great loss. 
 Believe me to be, Sir , Your obedient servant , L.L. Goodsall
