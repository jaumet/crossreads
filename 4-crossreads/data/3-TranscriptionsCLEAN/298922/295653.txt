 A draft went to Joppa today but no orders for me & I shall be content to do my 3 months in charge here. Dolly's Hospital will be within sight & Ismalia where she will live is only 1 mile away. Note all your news, & hope you got letters from England. Will look out for PARCELS mentioned. Went Ismalia for lunch & interviewed British Red + & arranged Flat for Dolly also saw C.O. of Hospital & had a hot bath at the French Club.
