Have very little news about any of the boys. I had a long letter from Gerald asking if I could tell him anything about Les,  but  to which I sent him all particulars I could, just as I gave them to you, but I fear they must seem doubly inadequate to him - However, it was no use trying to garnish what must be a terribly distressing occurrence, on account of the awful uncertainty.
I had a letter from Ath Cochrane a few days ago - He is still going through a school at Oxford.
Have seen nothing of Arny since April. As we are now in another Corps, and removed by 50 miles from part of the line he was in.
Must stop now. With all my love to yourselves & PatI am your loving Son Terence
