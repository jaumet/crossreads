After chipping Keith Anderson we went and saw Sparrow Co. Cowan was having a hot bath in a tub. They had furnished a small mess in an unruined room and collected furniture from houses around. After we went back to Bn H.Q. the only excitement was our planes going backwards and forwards over the Hun lines and drawing a little wild a.a. fire. Davis came in after mess and cropped my hair off close to the roots. Miles and others came up. We sent out a working party 150 strong digging on the Joppa Reserve line. There was no excitement during the evening and we just yarned and whiled away the time. Turned in at about 11 o'c and slept well and soundly. Thewlis, Stafford and Sutherland divide the night shift among them
