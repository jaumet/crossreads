 Dear Madam We have to acknowledge the receipt of our letter dated 22nd February wherein are enclosed particulars of the 7 cases shipped per H.M.A.T."Star of England" through the War Chest Depot, Sydney. 
 We are not able to advise the safe arrival of this consignment which will be distributed immediately. The cases addressed to the Composite Regiment will be handed over to the 1st Light Horse Brigade, for as you are no doubt aware, the former has been disbanded. 
 Your further letter of 13th March is also to hand, together with the 6 cases advised therein as having been shipped by W.D.and H.O.Wills, limited. In consequence with this, we note that the 3 cases addressed 1st.Light Horse are for the 1st L.H.Reserve, and these will be sent to Tel-el-Kebir as soon as opportunity arises. 
 We thank you very much for these two consignments which will be greatly appreciated by the men. Unfortunately the Light Horse Regiments are spread practically
