79 wks of soldiering
Stables at 6.30
Off again to Bahnasa at 10.30, this time rode down in train returning by road I brought a skull home for Pard, strapped it on to the back it (Hector) carried OK. The plane reported that the Senoussi had left the Oasis about 1000 strong were coming this way, they dropped a few bombs on them but owing to the sand they were not too effective.Second Regt got orders to move out to Nazlet-el-abid, about 40 miles S of Minia, we moved about 100 yds towards the centre of the camp. Two train loads of niggers (prisoners) went through today on their way to a concentration camp in Cairo. More mail arrived another one from Nell Mother.
