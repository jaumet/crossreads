Friday 8 January 1915
A beautiful clear day, fresh and cool, was the result of yesterday's rain.  At half past three in the afternoon, we were treated to an extremely novel spectacle.  Suddenly "Stop" was telegraphed from the bridge and at the same time the signal was given to the rest of the fleet to do likewise.  The "Ceramic" coming quite close to us, lowered a boat, and, with two naval and one military officer in her, it reached our side in a few minutes.  There was an exchange of despatches etc., and the boat returned.  Meanwhile, the ships had closed up considerably and the men cheered each other vociferously;  and the sight of seventeen troopships lying idly in mid-ocean was very novel;  and the enthusiasm of the men proved that they fully recognised that they have a common aim - the upholding of the Empire's and, most particularly, Australia's honour in whatever place they may be brought into action.
