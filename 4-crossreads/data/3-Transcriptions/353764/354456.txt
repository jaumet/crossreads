<p>25.4.16 Tuesday Anzac <strike>To</strike> day<br/>This was celebrated right throughout the Army &amp; was observed as a Holiday, although our Unit had to work just a hard as ever.<br/> However they gave our Train a Concert &amp; free spread at night &amp; it was enjoyed by the boys.<br/>I was unable to go but heard glowing accounts of it from Cousins.<br/> Loaded plates of dainties very rarely reached the Tables before they were empty.<br/>There was a little rioting in Cairo where several Native Houses were burnt down.  It is a good thing that there were not many of Aust Troops here, otherwise there would have been the devil to pay.<br/>The Artillery is practicing Shrapnel Firing on a range of Hills at the back of our Camp &amp; it is, at the present time one deafening roar.<br/>Weather still very hot &amp; unbearable in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>26.4.16 Wednesday<br/>This has turned out to be the hottest day ever it has been my lot to experience.  It is impossible to go outside for long &amp; the heat inside</p>
