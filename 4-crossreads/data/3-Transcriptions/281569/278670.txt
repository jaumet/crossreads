<p>12 May, 1916 Friday</p>
<p>Revielle as per usual</p>
<p>All preparations are now complete for the move, &amp; all stuff is packed.</p>
<p>The Dorsets arrived today &amp; a scratchy scraggy lot they are too their horses are like ponies &amp; I'm hanged if I know what they intend doing with their swords. They are camped down on the new site where shelters are to be erected without delay, the timber is arriving daily. I had to take a lamp (gas) which Pard has just finished out to the hills for a trial &amp; left here at 6 it was rather a climb at night but it worked OK. &amp; was easy reading for those in camp the distance was about nine miles, left at 8 &amp; got back home at 9.30 tired out &amp; also got another puncture.</p>
<p>Bed at 10.50 after meeting last train.</p>
<p>13 May, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Reveille as early as usual.</p>
<p>Packed all our traps today for the move tomorrow &amp; made arrangements for the cessation of the Signal Service, got instructions later to send 2nd class Telegraph set to Assiut &amp; cells to Qara.</p>
<p>Dorset crowd came down to take over the local lines of communications, they are garrisoning Sohag with 1 squadron, their H Qrs being at Malwadi 30 miles North of Assiut, our Tele station is to be cut out as they have no operators to do the job.</p>
<p>The wireless chaps are to go with us to Kantara &amp; are there to join up with the Squadron of whom we have heard nothing for the last 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Bed at 11.30 did the late run to the train.</p>
