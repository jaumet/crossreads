<p>April 6th.  1917.   Good Friday.<br/>What pleasant memories this day brings back to me of that glorious time I spent with you at Katoomba two long years ago. At 10 a.m. the bearers left the old Dressing Station for the Rest Station, (where I was three weeks ago). The distance must have been about seven miles, rather a long march as we were carrying our packs &amp; blankets etc., but it was done in good time, &amp; we arrived at our destination just in time for dinner. The bearers received a great reception from the remainder of the Unit. In the evening I attended an impressive Church service in a town close by. An Australian band was in attendance. One of the items given by the latter was the Dead March in Saul. I don't think that I have ever heard it played so beautifully before.</p>

<p>At 4.30 p.m. a grand dinner was given by the Colonel to the Bearers, just a little welcome for us. It was delicious, about eight courses, &amp; was appreciated by all. The fellows in the Tent Division worked very hard &amp; waited on us (menu of dinner sent home previously). At 7 p.m. a splendid concert</p>
