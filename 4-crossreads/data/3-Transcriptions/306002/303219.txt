<p>4.7.15<br/>two or three weeks have been rotten, most of it mouldy.  Les said he was too tired to go for a swim to-night so Stan &amp; I went on our own, on the way down to the beach we met Wilson (Morgan Welch's mate) &amp; he told me he had no word from Morgan.  The sea was calm again tonight &amp; a Torpedo boat was firing away at a target somewhere on land to the North of us.  The sunset tonight was the best I have seen since we landed here, as we were coming back from a swim 40 or 50 Maori's were marched along the beach for a dip, &amp; they were like a lot of kids as happy as could be.  A couple of Turk prisoners were in swimming with us this afternoon.  We still have to stand to arms at 3 oclock every morning.</p>
