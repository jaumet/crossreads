Things were fairly quiet not much work to do until about 19 oclock when the two Engines were standing on No. 4 Road when all of a sudden Fritz started putting shells over near the yard, it was pitch dark at the time, several shells proved to be Duds others exploded. Fritz had two Guns fireing 2 shells came over every 2 minutes.

I looked back saw my mate running towards me with his light, I crouched alongside of the Tender dirt pieces of shell
