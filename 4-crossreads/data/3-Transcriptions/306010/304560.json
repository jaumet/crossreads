<p>Australian base camp and a full two hours run in the train from Cairo &ndash; off the Delta on to the desert. Fixed up some transfers with the 5th Field Ambulance &amp; then visited a chap at No 2 Stationary Hospital, AAMC. Arrived back in Cairo at 8.45 pm. The camp reminds me of Mona only it is much bigger &amp; extends alongside the railway line for a couple of miles &ndash; plenty of bustle &amp; activity of course. The old 1882 battle-ground of Tel &ndash; el &ndash; Kolin (Arabic for "big plain") is just at the back of the camp.<br/>Feb 9" Wednes.<br/>We have been having a good deal more rain this <strike>year</strike> winter than last.
