 BACK at Moascar owing to Railway line being washed away by rain have to wait another few days  & could have been with my little wife all this time.   Having dinner with Col.  McLeish  tonight in his MESS. Did I mention seeing STANLEY BRAIM he has improved a lot & is now a Cadet in the Flying Corps & may get his commission, he is not drinking now. Letter from Laura & redirected one from May, please I did not get photo of Jack &  Douglas & I am  a Major not a Captain now for a year.
