 I hope these notes will be read by you Mother & no one else but our Captain has been drunk for the past 2 days & was also at Plymouth & Weymouth, it is bad enough travelling under normal conditions but now a man wants all the brains the Almighty ever gave him. The Doctor is of the same type but keeps out of the way, the P. & O. of the old days would not stand this sort of thing. Bright sunshine & warmer.
