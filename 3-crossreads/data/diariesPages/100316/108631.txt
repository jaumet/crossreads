26/4/18 Did not get up until about 10 am and then went round the Trenches round the Bn H.Q.. Things were extremely quiet the whole of the day. The Battalion was relieved without incident by Colonel Dawson 25th and Colonel Duggan 21st without any incident. Returned overland to our Bn H.Q. this time located in a cellar reeking of potatoes and onions and there slept on beds brought from our other H.Q.
27/4/18. Walked round our positions here in part and had a talk to some of the men. The day misty and the enemy shelling a lot. A crop runs behind and in front of our trenches. The village of Lavieville was not being strafed today but 4.2's and 5.9's were falling in front and heavily plastering the Amiens ? Albert road. Met Capt Coughlan of the Engineers and went round with him and with Major Dooley to set tonights tasks. The men had built bivouacs right over the trench with the result that they had completely destroyed its use for fighting. Plotted out L heads for the bivouacs and arranged for all the shelters and obstructions to be shifted tonight. The town of ALBERT is gradually crumbling into brickdust under the bombardments of our guns. The Holy Mademoiselle long since knocked of her perch. The once watered and macadamised streets of 4th Army H.Q. now are traversed by Hun soldiery instead of the dud equisites of an effeminate staff. At stand to bombardment and heavy machine gun fire on the left.
