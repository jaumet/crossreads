<p>30 June 1918 Sunday (X to X crossed out)<br/>X Still wondering what cable means &amp; if Joe has really sailed I shall be sorry if he has for your sake little Mother &amp; how is the Home to go on?  &amp; why address to KHAN YUNUS? X<br/>We go back tonight.  I'll miss my Red X stretcher, it is part of Trench Stores, covered with the dark stains of different poor boys blood running down to the stitched eyelet holes at each end, put in to drain.<br/>Anyway it kept me off the ground &amp; let the snakes go underneath- I'll miss it.<br/>Reached Camp at midnight &amp; the men had a big tail on them marching back per boot-</p>
