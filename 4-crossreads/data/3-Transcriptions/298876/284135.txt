<p>also 16 Nurses on board, some of them sick. A contingent Cingalese  is being formed here to proceed to the front. Silks &amp; moonstones seem to be the principal purchases by Europeans. Cigars I have smoked I found just alright can be purchased 3/- per 200 &ndash; About 20 men short at night.</p>
<p>Tuesday<br/>22/2/16</p>
<p>All Light Horse men sent ashore as picket gather up deserters, all aboard by 4 pm &ndash; the Boob is full awaiting their trial &ndash; several men admitted Hospital. D.T.'s &ndash; cuts &amp; bruises from rows. I had the chance of going ashore with Major Argyle but felt very sick &ndash; sort of Dengue hanging to me for the past week &amp; night work doesn't improve it. None of the men apart from Pickel were allowed ashore. Nigs in galore around the Boat all day' diving &amp; selling stuff &ndash; coaling etc.<br/>A lot of nigs came aboard yesterday</p>
