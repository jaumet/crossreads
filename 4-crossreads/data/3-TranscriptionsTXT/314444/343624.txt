to France he has been admitted to Hospital twice & at present he is down at one of the convalescent camps about one Hundred miles from here. Poor old Chas is getting out on Sept 1st so Lizzie wrote & told me. I expect he will be in camp in England a week or Two before coming out here again I will be looking forward to seeing him again. He is one of the best Teen  & I am proud of him for carrying that sleeping draft draught of his that he administers to the big cold footed M.P.'s
