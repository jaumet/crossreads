<p> <br/>out.  We had a half holiday.  Sunday 23rd rainy looking &amp; cold, but warm afternoon, we had church in the morning &amp; attended a lecture by Mr Virgo the Y.M.C.A. Empire Sec.  Monday rainy looking, we went for a route march about 7 mile or so to holiday resort, there is a ruined hotel (a large one) there, it was built on the sand right to the waters edge, but it didn't last long as the foundation was no good, all that remains now is the front part, it has better foundation than the rest of the building, though it will all be down before long, it is 4 or 5 stories high.</p>
<p>We marched back through a village, it looked very poverty stricken, we went to a lecture tonight.  Tuesday rainy looking we are on fatigue work at Etaples.  Wednesday we went for a route march to Paris-Plage a small town just across the water from our Camp, it is about 4 miles or so each way, It is a very pretty seaside resort, well laid out &amp; by the look of things, it must be a popular place, it has some nice buildings on the sea front.  Thursday 27th turned out a lovely day.  A draft to go to the front was finally selected.  Friday 28th July another lovely day, I was on cooks fatigue all day. Vic  &amp; I went for our evening walk. Saturday 29th I was on Cooks fatigue again today, the weather is lovely, but it got very warm in the afternoon, when I had a game of cricket. Sunday 30th another warm day, I was picked in a draft to go to the front, but drew out, because Vic wasn't picked to go.  I played cricket in the evening.  Monday 31st weather still grand, I went to a lecture.  Tuesday weather still good, I was on fatigue with the other boys, preparing the ground for Hospital tents.  Wednesday weather warm, we are shifting quarters to another part of the camp.  Fatigue in the afternoon at the hospital.  Thursday weather still good.  We received a challenge from the Artillery tea cricket match, we had game after tea.  Friday I messed about all day</p>
