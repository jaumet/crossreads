  
 - The anniversary of Threlfalls death by the way - the brigade went out accompanied by the Second Brigade. We reached Katia - by then occupied by our infantry at about 7 oclock waited there until 3 am & then proceeded to Dubarbos direct where we left our base. Coming out we had occasion to notice the Turkish fortifications of Oghratina, also we could see the tracks of their howitzer battery which they brought to Katia  & the manner in which they managed this  stupendous business.
