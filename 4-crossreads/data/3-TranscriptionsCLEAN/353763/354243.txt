  
 Tuesday Oct 20-1914 I am going - for the present anyway - to wind up my serial tale  -  We are back in a British port - a well known port & description wd  be superfluous  -  My letters will come regularly & I'll note everything of interest as it comes along  - 
 Sunday 18th= I put in aboard  -  We were using Divers to fix up AE2's new propeller & the rules of the service require the Dr not only to examine the man before he goes down but to hang around handy in case of accident  -  All went well & the job ended about 6 pm  - I  sd have mentioned that on Saty the big ships went out but, what their job is we don't know  -  On Monday morning we shifted our berth inshore  -  We now lie - with AE2 alongside  -  some 400 yards from the wharf  - I put in the morng on the Grantala  -  I took a sick man over - an ERA (Engine Room Artificer) I stayed to lunch & talked to the doctor men  -  The Fizz & sparkle is off the champagne now we'r out of German territory & back to a British settlement  -  All that remains is to watch & ward - Doctor man's job in the navy is potential at all times  -
