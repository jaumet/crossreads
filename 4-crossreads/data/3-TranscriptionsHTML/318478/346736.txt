<p>Despite the fact that one gets 4 Turkish pounds for one Bradbury everything is very expensive except bread, and I shall be glad when we pull out again for the road.</p>
<p>Tomorrow may see us getting ready.  We expect to travel in open trucks by goods train from Haidar Pasha on the Asiatic through Palestine to Cairo.  I could say much more about the Terrible Turk but at this present it is as well to wait the issues of the Peace conference with a view to passing the censor.  The Turk has quite good manners when one asks him a direction or bumps into him by accident.</p>
