 Court Reporting Office Mint Building Macquarie Street, Sydney 2nd June, 1965 The Honourable Mr. Justice Ferguson, Supreme Court, Sydney. Dear Judge, The members of the Court Reporting Branch, in these few words, wish to convey to you their heartfelt appreciation of the understanding and consideration which you have expended to them during the years you have been on the Supreme Court Bench. We feel the Bench is losing, by statutory retirement, one of its most competent jurists and so too the Court Reporters, who have had the good fortune to report the proceedings of the Supreme Court presided over by you, will miss you from the Bench. The ca. Your retirement has been well earned in the service of the State, and we wish you and Mrs. Ferguson many years of good health and happiness in the future, with every opportunity to follow more fully your sporting and other interests. Yours sincerely, K Alting Hon. Secretary, Staff Representative Committee.
