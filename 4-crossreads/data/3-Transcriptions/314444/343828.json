<p>I am sorry to hear that you have been troubled with rheumatism and it was very good of you to write me such a long letter. With best wishes to Mrs Garling and Pat tell her not to worry about Terence as he has put on a stone since he arrived here and he is looking very well.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Eric Lenehan.</p>
<p>P.S. Mother wrote to me and told me about Joe's ride to Piton it was rather plucky of him to take on along ride like that by himself How the youngsters would like being here riding on the donkeys &amp; camels, they would be very amused at mounting a camel.<br/>R.E.L.</p>
