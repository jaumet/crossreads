to move out tomorrow. The Canadians are very nice fellows always seem anxious to pal up to Australians.The weather is very cold I am dreading the approach of winter. I received several letters today but none from Nina, but I suppose she has registered a few I will get them later on.Tomorrow will give us a taste of the furious fighting which is in progress, as it will take us right onto the Somme Front. There is no mistake about it being very dangerous, but our Fate is in Gods hands entirely. The first Infantry Brigade of our Division (4th) moved out this afternoon.

What a night we had the day is far worse. I was camped underneath a wagon as usual at about 12 pm woke up found myself lying in a pool of water. The rain was pouring down there was no alternative but to sleep in it. It has rained again all day we are knee deep in mud water. The Transport is harder altogether we are not having what may be called a rosy time of it.The wretched weather is impeding our troops fine advance altogether is proving a great nuisance to everyone.We move out at 9 am tomorrow morning but I do not as yet know our destination
