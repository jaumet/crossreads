<p>at 7 P.M.   Had dinner at The Popular &amp; then went to see ZigZag at the London Hippodrome.   It was a Revue in which George Robey was the Chief item.    Walked home to Victoria &amp; on my way had some tea &amp; cake at a street coffee stall, the first time I had visited one.   T'was an interesting experience as the crowd round these stalls after midnight is rather a mixed &amp; interesting one.   Packed my my kit &amp; fixed up my uniform to be posted in the morning so that I could get it if I return to London.  Went to bed about 1.30.</p>
<p>Saturday 12th Jan<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were called at 5 A.M. had breakfast at 6 A.M.  &amp; caught the train which left Victoria at 6.50 A.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual the crowd were very silent on the way to Folkestone, for myself I slept most of the way.   When we reached Folkestone we went into some billets alongside the Station &amp; were there long enough to get refreshments at the Y.M.C.A.   We then went onto the boat</p>
