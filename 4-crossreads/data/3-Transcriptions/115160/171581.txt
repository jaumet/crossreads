<p>Dear Jim,</p>
<p>I intended to have written sooner. I am afraid I am to late for christmas I meant to have sent you a little parcel for then but I was in bed for a week with a chill but I will just send it for the new year as I missed the&nbsp;christmas mail. &nbsp;I hope you are keeping well &amp; not feeling the cold to much it is very cold here &amp; storming not a bit like christmas I am glad to say. &nbsp;We are all well at home I am alright again. I received your registred letter alright with the&nbsp;5 pounds which I put in the bank for you the very day I got it, is there any word of your leave again the men</p>
