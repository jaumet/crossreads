Afternoon off. Jock Mac & self jaunt off.  Good concert on in evening. Received parcel from May containing tinned goods, biscuits, prunes cream etc. tres bon.  Attend practice of male choir at 8 p.m. Capt. Archdale conducts. Farrow sent to Blighty today. 7 weeks we had him. We're very proud of his "save". He should have been dead a dozen times, but he fought well & finally pulled through.
