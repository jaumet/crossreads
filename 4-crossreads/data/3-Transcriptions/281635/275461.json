<p>very cold. Guns fairly active all day. <br/>9/4/18 Foggy last night &amp; this morning. Very heavy artillery barrage started about 4.30am. Several shells fell fairly close to C.C.S, probably Baillieul. Artillery fire very heavy all day &amp; in afternoon considerable machine gun fire.  After tea we were told to stand by &amp; not leave the camp. No 2 British C.C.S evacuated during today. Saw some despatch riders after tea &amp; they gave us the news. Fritz attacked the Portuguese &amp; they cleared out leaving our flanks open.  Heard Fritz took Sailly &amp; reached La Gorgue, also that Estaires has been smashed up. A Tommy told us legs &amp; arms were lying about everywhere &amp; numbers of people buried in the ruins. About 4pm</p>
