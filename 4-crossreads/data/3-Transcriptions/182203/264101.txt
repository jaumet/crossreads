<p>as we were, though our work is very interesting and keeps us out of mischief  also no time to think of our own little troubles. Received a nice long letter from Jack Main &amp; he gave me a lot of news about a number of my friends, some poor chaps are wounded    &amp; in Hosp. in England, one poor boy was killed. He was one of our adopted brothers both in Cairo &amp; Ismailia. He was an Officer of 21st Battalion.<br/>Fred wrote quite a cheery letter from Belgium, he has been nearly all over France, these last three months. Said he was getting leave &amp; going to Rouen to see me &ndash; So hope he received my letter in time saying I'm not there. Have not heard of Ron, Norman or George for ever so long. Not any word of J &ndash; so I'm very worried about him.</p>
