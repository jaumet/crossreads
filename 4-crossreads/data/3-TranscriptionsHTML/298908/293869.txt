<p>I am down again this evening in "Aggie Westons" &amp; am going to do a bit of writing to the accompaniment of the orchestra.  I noticed as I came past the Evening News office that the Huns were handing over their fleet today, what a triumph for Britain to get rid of that great fleet without having to fire a shot even, I need scarcely say how pleased the people down here are over it for half of Devonshire are in those great ships of ours, they had one experience when the Battle of Jutland was fought half the Country was in mourning then &amp; they have been dreading another such turnout.<br/>I have just seen a very amusing thing a flash looking Tommy was announced with a great flourish to give a display with cards &amp; conjuring, he started off with the usual flashness of these snoozers when someone in the hall started to roar with laughter, so the Tommy stopped &amp; wanted to</p>
