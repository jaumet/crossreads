Most of the 2nd Division has gone away down to the Canal. I don’t know what we are going to do but all leave to Cairo has been stopped for the present, so we will probably be on the move again soon. I hope so at any rate as action is preferable to this

We played the 6th Fld Amb. cricket today and beat them by a few runs. Went to pictures tonight. Very fair program. Prices 1st Class 5 pt. 2nd class 3 Pt. and 3rd Class 2 pt.

I understand Mrs Hindmarsh and Hilda were out today to see Ron and they sent me a note asking me to have lunch with them but it didn’t arrive. I was awfully sorry to miss them. Aubrey had lunch with them
