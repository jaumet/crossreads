12/6/17 Paris
but we had not the time. From here we had a very pleasant round run to St Germain en Laye which rises in big wooden bluffs above the Seine and dominates Paris. The German batteries were here during the siege of ?70. a fine old castle done by Francois mostly. We drove home passing close to the well known Valerien Mount which is strongly fortified. Dined at Metier in good comfort had a soup, some frogs, asparagus, ice a benedictine some wine item 14 frs. Returned to hotel and spent a pleasant evening tete-a-tete on the balcony and then went up to room, where the people next door proved rather interesting with noise action. As result of todays tour I am inclined to think that Paris is set in a forest.
