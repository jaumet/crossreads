  
 Tel -El- Kebir Egypt 15.4.1916 Dear Mother, The above is my present address, but but may not be for long so letters for me had better be addressed to the Australian Base P.O. Egypt.  I want you to send five pounds (5.) of my money to Mrs E. W. Buckhitt, 79 Weinberg Road, Glenferrie Melbourne as she looks after her brother in law Chas. T. Buckhitt's affairs   & he got 10 cabled over   & gave me half to save cabling expenses.  I will mention this matter in my next letter in case this one goes astray.  I may not be able to get back to my regiment owing to my long absence, but will let you know later if I join anything else.  We had a good but uncomfortable trip across from England,   & I was glad to be able to get ashore at Gibralta   & Malta. Love to all from Your affectionate Son Charlie N.B. To be censored.) Tpr Chas. R. Sherwin 500. 6th A.L.H. Regt.
