<p>March 1918<br/>it keeps them much cooler.</p>
<p>Tuesday 5th<br/>Orderly Sergeant for the day.  Was on duty all day till 10 pm at night.  Went up to the Bank to see if any money had arrived in the morning.  It seems as though no money is arriving now for soldiers in Egypt, but cannot find out why it was stopped.  It makes things rather awkward as I want to pay for some things I sent to Kate.  Its impossible to save money in Cairo at &pound;2.10/- per fortnight.  Wish some of the heads who stopped the cables would come over here &amp; give it a try.  Got through a good bit of work in the afternoon &amp; at night wrote letters to Doug &amp; Edna Ferguson, which I posted.  Believe there is a mail going out in a day or two.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6th<br/>Put the usual day.  Met Bill Williamson &amp; Joe Nevitt  in the afternoon.  Both are at the School of Instruction.  Went to a whist drive at the Australian Soldiers Club in the evening.  Quite a number of English people go there.  Must have been fully 20 ladies there.</p>
