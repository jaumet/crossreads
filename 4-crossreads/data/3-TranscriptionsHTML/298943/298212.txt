<p>Friday 31st<br/>Air raid last night with plenty of <strike>dogin</strike> dodging about overhead, but no local bombs.<br/>Yesterday afternoon I commenced helping Vic paint physical jerks diagrams show correct &amp; incorrect methods. A couple of days respite from chills etc.<br/>Glorious weather, &amp; feelings of good health &amp; confidence in the future. Fritz is at it again, &amp; now it is south of the Somme</p>
