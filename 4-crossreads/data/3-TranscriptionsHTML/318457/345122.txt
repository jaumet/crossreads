<p>[14-16th October 1914]<br/>interesting as scenery, even from the distance of several miles.</p>
<p>On Wed. Mr Small visited me on the ship spending [indecipherable] three hours here; and on Thurs. Deane came over. He was very anxious to come. His place is Danuilevu about 12 miles out by road. I spoke to him on the 'plane when at the mission house. He looks well and is just as full of spirit as ever. He had done more of his D.D. course with London, having taken an exam last June. I envied him very much in this regard.</p>
<p>In harbour now at Suva are &ndash; Flag, Montcalm, Sydney, Encounter 3 destroyers, AE2, Aorangi, several oil ships and colliers. The Encounter with destroyer and Aorangi arrived yesterday 15th.</p>
<p>The weather has been very wet lately &ndash; yesterday was a deluge most iof the day &ndash; Today is fine but cloudy and threatening.</p>
<p>People in Suva appear to be friendly and sympathetic. A few days ago they had a great scare &ndash; many rushed off inland by motor fearing an attack. The German ships were near by &ndash; perhaps 500 miles but did not come here. The place is practically undefended.</p>
