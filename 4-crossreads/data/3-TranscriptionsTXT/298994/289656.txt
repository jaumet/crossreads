 About 12 o'clock midday, we were standing about 2 miles out from Fremantle. The C.O. of the transport organised a concert on board in the evening. We spent a very pleasant evening; the lights of Fremantle showing up very finely. 
 News was quickly circulated, that we were going to visit Perth. That proved to be the case! 
 On Sunday morning, 29th October 1916, about 11.30. a.m, we were taken ashore in small steamers, to the quay at Fremantle. From Fremantle, we were carried by train to Perth, a distance of about 12 miles. The carriages were of a most antique type, but who cared! 
 We reached Perth about 12.15. p.m. We were now free to spend the time sight seeing. A friend and myself had dinner in Barrack St, Perth. We had a good look round the city, and its suburbs.
