At one of our guns this morning we had the misfortune to lose a fine young fellow in Bombardier Ted Baynes [Edgar Baynes no. 2282] while Lieut Ross was wounded slightly. The Turks gave us a good deal of shelling &ndash; it was unceasing all day till sundown. As I went along the beach in the afternoon the casualty sheds were full telling their own mournful tale.
