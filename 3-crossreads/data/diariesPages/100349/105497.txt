By night the lights of Port Elizabeth present a fairy appearance, but daylight revealed just an ordinary town. I managed to get among the percenage of men who were allowed ashore. We were the first Australian troops to land here. The townspeople gave us a rattling good time. A reception in the Town Hall and splendid entertainment. There are no wharves here all cargo is transported into lighters. We all returned to the ship at 6.P.M. more or less the worse for the generous hospitality of the townsfolk. A nice little city.

Sailed from Port Elizabeth at midnight. A reorganisation was made on the ship today when the men were made into companies one for each state. Arrived off East London at 11.A.M.
