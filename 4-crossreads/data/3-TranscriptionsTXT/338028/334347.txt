I am horribly mixed up with dates, no one seems to know definitely the day or date. Have made myself comfy here, a lot of books and conveniences, one of my niggers worships me and is acting as my batman, brings me a bucket of water over a mile each morning to wash in, rode to Duntroon did sick parade, nothing exciting to report.
