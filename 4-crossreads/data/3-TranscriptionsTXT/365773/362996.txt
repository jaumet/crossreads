&is doing his best to get back home, I wrote to the address the Red Cross gave me & the chap he was staying with wrote back to say he had gone away leaving no address & said he was O.K. I hope you have further news of him yourself.I am at present waiting for a boat to go home - expect to get away early this month - this big strike is holding up the boats a lot - I will wire you from W.A. when I reach there.With heaps of love to all at 'Las Palmas' & hoping to see you soon.Your loving brother
