<p>December 1916<br/>home from Doug, several papers &amp; parcels from Mr &amp; Mrs John Scarvell &amp; from Doles.  During the week the Anzac Mtd Division less our Brigade marched into El Arish with scarcely any opposition.  On the 23rd they pushed on &amp; struck the Turks at Magdaba where after a sharp fight they took the Turkish positions which were made well, several being of concrete.  1130 unwounded Turks were taken prisoner &amp; their casualties were heavy.  Our total losses could not have been much more than 1/10  of the Turks.  Our brigade was very disappointed not being in this show.  The wounded &amp; prisoners were all got away by sea which would be much easier than by the rough desert railway.  On Xmas day I was out with 7 men all day at a place called Reuisat.  It was very cold &amp; in the afternoon it rained enough to wet the ground.  We got back to camp at dark.  More puddings &amp; Xmas billies arrived so we have got enough</p>
