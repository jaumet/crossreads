Sunday 13/5/17.Another exciting night again but not so full of danger as privously, got over for the Rations earlier so could see where we were going & it's the better Plan. Had to take some up to Head Quarters later on in the dark how I hate the dark my eyes are not as good as they were & am always in a funk that I shall fall down some deep shell hole & get hurt one doesn't want that sort of hurt over here. Got back safely soaked through with sweat, very sultry weather.
Go out to the supports tonight. Fritz counter attacked again this morning about 3 don't know how he got on this time. The Scotties took 400 Prisoners yesterday & the 15th Brigade 157.
The Bombardment was terrific while it lasted but everything is quietened down a bit now, always does when our Planes get up there are about 30 up now & they have the hun bluffed, scarcely ever see any of his. Some rumours that fritz is evacuating in front of us.Pay14/1 25.8.0
Monday 14/5/17.came out last night & not likely to forget it. Huns must have  got wind of it & an infernal Bombardment started which beat anything yet & that's saying something, our Posi was shelled for 2 or 3 hours & it was quite dark & Raining when we got away, with that creepy feeling you get when the shells come behind you. Got here Norreil at about 11.30. & the shells were bursting all round this place owing to Batteries being near. What a  night it was I have had my fill & wish I was out of it, have had 6 days & nights
