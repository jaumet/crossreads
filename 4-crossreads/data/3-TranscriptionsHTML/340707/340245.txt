<p>119<br/>my pleasantest souvenirs of Paris &amp; so you find diary will principally tell only of Sundays &amp; not very much as I am writing in June 1920 (9 mos after)</p>
<p>28-9-19<br/>To day we visited Musee Guimet. Brise accompanies on all my visits to Musee as they interest her.</p>
<p>She is of the type that seeks instruction everywhere &amp; does not expect to find it in dances or cafes. Of little school education for she was educated like Dad She has acquired more knowledge than the ordinary girl especially in the world of art A little savage who shuns puberty &amp; is as <strike>shy</strike> timid a dear in company she only shows her knowledge when she meets a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>The musee contains contains a wonderful collection of Chinese pottery which shows how advanced the Chinese are &amp; how ignorant we are. They shame Sevres &amp; that when Europe was almost savage.</p>
<p>On entering sticks &amp; umbrellas must as usual be given up. No fee is demanded but you cannot get therein without a considerable pourboires which is same thing in my eyes I shall be glad to find a country</p>
