<p>Friday 16 April 1915</p>
<p>The passing of Kandeliusa lighthouse at eleven o'clock this morning was proof that we were well on our way to Lemnos &ndash; our immediate though not our ultimate destination.  A little while after, we had our practise fire turn out.  On board a troopship, according to regulations, troops must be shown their respective fire stations, and occasionally fire alarms are given to accustom the troops to a prompt and silent turn-out.  So there was nothing very extraordinary in the fire alarm being sounded.  But when everybody, crew included were ordered to put on lifebelts, things began to assume a more serious aspect.  Our course was suddenly changed and rumours of important wireless information and submarines were circulated throughout the boat.</p>
<p>But after an hour's expectancy of an attack, the troops were dismissed and ordered to sleep beside their life-belts.  It is just this occasional reminder which makes you realise that what you consider to be a big picnic, an elaborate tourist trip and a supendous waste of money, is really an active service affair.</p>
