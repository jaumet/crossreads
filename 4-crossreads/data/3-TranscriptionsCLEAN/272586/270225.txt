 My Dear Mother 
 I suppose you are just about wondering how we are getting along. well we're as right as pie so far, but are clearing for action. last reports & offer for 800 of our picked skins were so unsatisfactory. that we have decided to do a break Our roads will be in different directions this time Chas has a sort of half offer of  a job but will not know for a couple of days if there is anything in it. It will be cattle work on Yetman. I hope he gets on there. he has a fair load to hump about & travelling for graft out here at such a time as this is nothing but a gamble, one might draw a winning ticket first go & you might travel on till your horse nocks up & gets poor & silver all gone. For myself I have mapped out a pretty big order as our friend William has also done. He looked out over the world from Potsdam & then drew the sword which he cannot sheathe without victory or honour & went forth to conquer. he apparently did not look toward the little island where the bulldog lives. Now, I can see as far as England & if I have exceptionally good luck I'll get there. there are a few big obstacles in the road, the closest & naturally the largest looking being my big pony.
