 And bravely though our boys did toil to nobly win the day The odds were with the dreadnoughts of the foe They little knew that retribution hurried on the way Till part of Britain's first line let them know 
 They came and joined our cruisers and commenced to pour in shells And at once the Germans doubled back for Keil They could hold their own with cruisers &amp; the children of the fleet But the fury of our first line made them reel 
 They blew the Huns to pieces as they fled towards their home And 18 ships were sunk beneath the wave They won't come out again to try conclusions on the sea The perils of our battleships to brave 
 So once again old England's proved "Brittania rules the waves" And let the Germans try as best they can They'll find Brittania's might is opposed to German spite And as able to defeat her on the land
