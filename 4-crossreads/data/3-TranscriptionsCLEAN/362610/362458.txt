  
 Wednesday 30 August 1916 A miserable cold & wet day. Immediately after breakfast set out on the bike to find the Div. Gas School & after a lot of trotting round managed to locate it. Was there all the morning, & the afternoon being more boisterous than ever, I stayed inside getting a few letters written.
