February Sun.6th
Payday. 100 P.T. Glorious day Bugles commence business again after being out of action, the whole time since leaving Heliopolis. Revielle blown at 6 instead of 6.30 and first parade at 6.30 instead of 7. Reminds us of the old days at Liverpool and the 2 parks. Arab came round our hut selling eggs, 2 for 1 P.T. we beat down his price to 12 for 4 P.T. and purchased 3 dozen He gave Payne a bottle of "bakshee"milk, so we made egg flips in the morning, had poached eggs with our meal for dinner, and with the eggs and milk left over we made a custard for tea. The best days feed we have had for some time and didn't we enjoyed it.
Monday 7th
Yesterday we were issued with tobacco and matches (2 boxes matches, 2 oz. tob. per man.) tobacco in 4 oz tins. I tossed "Bricky" and won the whole 4 oz. Wrighty got into holds with "Gerty" yesterday over dropping a Tobacco tin and is "tattoo" this morning. "Doby" was paraded before the "Col" who talked to him like a father, Doby was dismissed, and then he brought a charge against Rumming for insulting language, but as the Col. appealed to him to drop it, he did so. Poor old "Wrighty" must have killed a bloomin? Chinaman at some time, as his case was a very weak one, yet he got 4 days pack drill, so he'll be careful with his tobacco tins now. Payne procured a billy-full of milk and we had cocoa for supper, we are living very high lately.
Tuesday 8th

So here am I sitting on the Canal Bank enjoying a sun bake, and watching the traffic pass by and the engineers building the Filters, "Doby the loafer" is keeping me company.
