<p>yard where a large number of German Prisoners were working unloading &amp; stacking Timber under the direction of their N.C.O's, they all seemed a happy lot &amp; in good health &amp; condition, of course these prisoners were all under an Armed Guard, After I left the Train at Calais, I again went along for a Cup of Tea &amp; had my lunch &amp; a stroll &amp; back again to the Station &amp; left at 2.40 Pm for St Omer arriving there at 4.15 Pm.</p>
<p>Tuesday 16th.<br/>This day I caught a Light Engine returning to Les Fontinettes Depot &amp; after a good run arrived at the Depot just before 11 am &amp; after a chat with some of our Fitters who were stationed there putting the Rods on New Engines just over from England. These Engines are known as W.D. meaning War Department &amp; They are a fine lot weighing 123 Tons when ready for the Road. They are 8 wheel Coupled with Outside Cylinders &amp; Stephenson's Link Motion They are no doubt a very fine Engine &amp; well up to date, having the Westinghouse &amp; Steam Brake,</p>
