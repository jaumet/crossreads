<p>coming back from the firing line we had to run the gauntlet of the German guns they were pouring it in properly, evidently they think we are massing man in a little gully just close to Contalmaison, but they are sadly out of it, the ground around here is simply turned upside down with shells it must have been something awful the fire, there are also some German guns destroyed quite close to here, I'll bet there is about 30 acres of ground here that you couldn't ride a horse over for shell holes &amp; some of them are 15 or 20 ft. deep it is a sight that has to be seen before you can form any idea of what it is like.<br/>A small mail came in tonight but I never got any</p>
