<p>Thursday 3 August 1916<br/>Again hot. Busy with Div. Gas Officer in the morning &amp; in the afternoon going round to battalions seeing abut gas helmets. Before tea rode out again to St. Leger to try &amp; get the collar for my shirt : it was not done &amp; I went on to see Rid to get him to fix it up if possible. Had to wait some time to see him &amp; afterwards rode back most of the way with him. After tea moved my belongings back to my old billet, permission to do so having been obtd. from the brigade major.</p>
