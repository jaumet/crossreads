I had a letter from Aunt Lily Thacker last night. I wrote &amp; told her about meeting a Mr Nobb across in Cambridge. It turns out he was there rector at Carlingford before coming to England to finish his studies.Well father I don't feel like writing will try and pull myself together &amp; write you a good long letter in a few days<br/>Your sincere son  Clyde</p>
