  
 arrived at Chepy Valines & there we found a seat which was jolted to pieces in first few minutes. Thereafter I decided to walk & the private on front gave me his seat & we sat straddled across seat & in this way reached Gamaches having travelled about 7 KM to much in a 9 KM journey because driver was 34th & only knew the way via Chepy. 
 On arrival I found the finest state of disorganisation that it was possible to conceive & I have been in the military some years now. No one was in charge. No one knew anything. There was not even a billet & no one seemed to care. The RC padre Major [Ploemel] the last of the family of that name in Brittany escorted me round many places but all in vain & in despair I put up at the Hotel St Pierre (4 fr) for the night Little did I think when I dined here last that I should ever see it again much less dine in it 
 13-4-19 (Sun) I rose 8.30 pm & proceeded to mess. All that now remain is McKenzie De Vere Sheehan, Padree Major Wheeler & Prentice & subsequently Collier. These will probably all be on the last  draw  draft for home & will probably leave here about 5th May. 
 I am rather anxious over my Paris course & have written 2 letters to London
