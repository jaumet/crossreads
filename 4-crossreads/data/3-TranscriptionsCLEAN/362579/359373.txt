  
 nervous   &  sad. A sister  &  orderly were killed at a C.C.S. close by. Don't worry about me because we are well cared for   &  do not think we shall be put in such dangerous area again. 
 Dorothy   &  I are very well. Some of our Battalions are camped near   &  called a couple of our friends to see us, so we shall be out with then this afternoon. With our men could keep out of it altogether. This is a very pretty spot   &  seems healthy for the camps. Major C . - is going to Aust. at the beginning of next months, so just address my letters C/O Aust Base Post Office - etc until you hear from me again. 
 I bought a new pair of boots this a.m. they are very difficult to get   &  I'm very hard on boots now. 
 Cannot say much but should love to tell you heaps. Am very well   &  happy. Fondest love   &  kisses to you all. 
 From Edith.
