<p>am writing here, but a few miles from it, it is just as calm &amp; natural as if I was sitting in a small hut in my own land, 15,000 miles from the war!</p>
<p>10th September  Monday Morning    Went to Arques to the 5th Brigade but unfortunately they had received orders to move quickly towards a concentration centre.  So I proceeded to Fauquembergues to the 3rd Divisional Headquarters. These are situated in a glorious old chateau, surrounded by fine avenues &amp; glades with grass lawns. Most in fact of the large chateaux are taken over by the Military. I met Capt Bean, our Official Correspondent &amp; thence to Ralenscourt, where we interviewed the Photographic Censor. His duty is to examine all photographs likely to convey any information to the enemy - seemingly in most cases a most absurd proceeding</p>
