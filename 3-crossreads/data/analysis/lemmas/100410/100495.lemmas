I do not know wether you understand our feel , you must not think that we are calous , at present I can see Queeni now sing " we do n't want to lose you " at the Hall in Queen St Woollahra . We do n't forget although we will not give way to our feel , if we did you would not like it , You say that your front is look over the Harbour the back over Bondi Beach , well Lillian I can pictur the whole scene but am content pleas God we will see it someday . You need never worri about your littl band of swastika , although they have not won V.Cs . etc it is not becaus they do not deserv them . I can truth say they not one ever shirk his duti , and at the present time , are all wish to be back into the fray again . Lillian you can take all the credit yourself of that littl emblem , you cannot realis what it has done none of us would have ever left the Bn onli that we were compel to , through serious ill or wound Leo was unconsci when I had him in the first aid
