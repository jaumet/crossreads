of patients here. I had sent my  cable or should have said I had seen the dear boy. He is doing splendidly but will take a long time to be quite well again. He was shot through his R.  chower lower cheek, splintered the jaw bone a little then it passed through to the other side  He can talk alright  & is able to eat food now. The poor kiddie was awfully delighted to see me    &  got a great surprise.      He is liked very much & seems to be very happy. I see him every - day. He is walking about a little now. Am in a fearful hurry. Fondest love  & kisses to you all  & love to my friends  & I am is perfect health. Hope you are all well & happy. I have not received any letters yet.More wounded soldiers arriving.Yours lovingly                                                                                                                                                                                          Edith
