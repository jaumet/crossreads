the Drains because Fritz was all over the Camp we expected a few Bombs to drop, but Fritz was not on a Bomb Dropping Expedition so there fore no harm came to us. This Aerial Display was the best we had witnessed up to date, we all enjoyed the fun. There is no mistake Fritz has beautiful machines, they appeared to us to be like Large Dragon Flies bearing down on their prey. as their colour was of a silver Grey they glittered beautiful in the Sun, we could distinctly see the Black Cross on the planes. Eventually all the other Balloons were hauled down, Fritz had 7 Machines taking part in the Display. After the Excitement abated I went out for a stroll until Bed time then turned in.
Sunday 8th/7/17-
After Dinner my chum myself decided to take a stroll into Poperinghe, so we dressed as the weather was unsettled rain had fallen making the Roads in a terrible condition as the Traffic at all times
