from which it is drawn by the women. The whole scene is a riot of color, and the chanting shanty of the labourers as they did their rounds, harmonising with the babbling of the womenfolk, gave just the right touch of life to this interesting little picture.
About 5 miles from Yebna we drew into Deiran where the Desert Mounted corps at present have their headquarters. There is an extraordinary contrast between this pretty little village and the native villages through which we have been passing. Its inhabitants are principally Jews, and their clean well built houses at once transported me to the outlying areas of Mosman Bay Sydney. The walls are of stone, generally painted white, and are roofed with red tiles. The streets are well kept and avenued with Australian gum trees.
