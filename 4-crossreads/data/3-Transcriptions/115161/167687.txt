<p>CHAPTER XXXV.</p>
<p><u>SOME QUICK MOVE</u>.</p>
<p>We leave here in lorries early one morning, snowing heavily and&nbsp;ice everywhere.&nbsp; Travelling is pretty exciting, owing to the slipperiness of the roads.&nbsp; If a road happens to be at all on the slope, the driver finds it pretty hard to keep the lorry in the centre, but all goes well until about 9.p.m. when suddenly the lorry seems to show an inclination to lie down, and before we know where we are, the baggage and &quot;stuff&quot; we are lying on rolls over the top of us, and to our dismay the lorry rolls over on its side.&nbsp; We all get out and find that the poor old thing had slipped off the road into a ditch, and all our efforts to move it are fruitless.&nbsp; We walk on for a mile or so and come to a small village, in which there is a caf&eacute;, we have a cup of coffee and find the place is named AUTILLE.&nbsp; There are five of us all told.</p>
