Two months as Instructor in Charge of the Scouting & Raiding Area, G.H.Q
Central Training School Le Havre
(the Bull Ring)
FRANCE.
6/9/17.
My Dear Ones,
   Well, I've made another move away from the regiment again, but just for a couple of months while they are out in billets training.
   Just now my location is near the seacoast and close to a large town ^Le Havre at the mouth of a fine river and it is here that the A.I.F. has its base, training and equipping the new drafts as they come overseas to proceed to their regiments.
   The Central Training school is an institution set high in a hill and surrounded by training areas of large extent and well equipped, here reside the "Canaries" the officers and N.C.O's of the Institutionructional Staff so called from the broad yellow bands (brassards) that each wears on each arm.
   Thousands of men march up daily from the Bases spread for a couple of miles around the Central Training School; these men receive six hours instruction in various subjects for five days then after that, when all except the backward may be considered "finished" they then join their regiments.  The C.T.S. is splendidly equipped and the instruction is extremely practical, for though the staff consists of men permanently unfit, the instructors are only temporary, being drawn from Active Service and changed about every two months.
