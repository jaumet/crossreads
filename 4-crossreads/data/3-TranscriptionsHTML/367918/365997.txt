<p>P.S.<br/>I had almost forgotten to say that I am glad to be still receiving both "Current History" and "The Cornhill" as well as the chocolates. As I may be going away shortly though I think it would be best to cancel the order or at least not to renew it. I will wire you when I move.<br/>RJH</p>
