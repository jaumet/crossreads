  
 it will be a memorable Xmas Eve, & I shan't forget the crowd of silent men in the hot semi darkness of the Arabian Sea & the lazy splash of the waves against the ships sides for we stopped while he was being buried, this is to allow the body to sink below the propellers,   everyone on board is shocked at the happening it has been a regular stunner, its rather funny to record but when I was laying down reading two chaps were talking of deaths & etc & one of them said we will have to have one on our boat or she wont be a troopship,  little did we dream that there was then a dead man on board & least of all did we realize it was the C.O.  I expect it was on account of his nerves that he treated Harry & I like he did when we went before him, for ours is not a serious charge
