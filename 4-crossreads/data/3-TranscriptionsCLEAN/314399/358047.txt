Wednesday 19 February 1919Rushed around in the morning. Met Marie after lunch & we went to Westminster Abbey & Cathedral. Gee it is great. Beats the frog churches easily. Went out to Janet's hospital for dinner & had a gay old time. Janet & I broke a glass as I was drinking. It cut her finger & my lip. Not very serious tho. as usual it rained all day.
Thursday 20 February 1919Rained again. Great hobby of London this rain. Went out to Brixton in the afternoon. then rushed out to Dad's place & had dinner & then he took his Aunt, her Cousin &  Kris to see Chu Chin Chow. Enjoyed it immensely. Was excellent & could go again.
