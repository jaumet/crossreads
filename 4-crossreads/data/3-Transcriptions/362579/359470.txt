<p>all I can   &amp;  have my clothing etc fixed up &ndash; shall  give dear old mother plenty of mending etc. Hope the 'Phone is on. We will all have a really jolly time   &amp;  hope the weather is good that dear mother   &amp;  the family can have some picnics. Oh, I'm quite excited when I think of it.</p>
<p>sometimes the boat takes 12 weeks to get to Aussie. Hope we go through the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Give my love to all my friends   &amp;  hope they are all well.</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all   &amp;  hope you are all well.</p>
<p>Heaps of joy, luck   &amp;  good health for the New Year.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
