Dear Dad,
Just a line to let you know that I hope to be home late on Friday night & I will be able to go to Jack's send-off on Saturday night.  We have not received Mrs. Howard's letter yet but as I am home this weekend probably something will be done then.  You can come up to Hawkesbury & we could get a day's leave to run down & see you there but I would not advise coming up here, some of the patients are very rough & would be ducking in for a swim naked.  We are getting on first rate with our work & as there is plenty of it we will soon be good enough to go away.  Well as I have other letters to write I will keep the news till I come home.  We are in spanking health & trusting you are all the same.  Will close with Love from
Harry, Ellis & Bill
