Ushered into a large brightly colored tent.  Sgts. remain outside.  We take along the Cavalry interpreter, who left him behind to help with 2/3 of their troop as an escort until we raise a force.  After a lot of delay we managed to get our point in, i.e. we wanted a few guides to show my officers to the various villages among the hills.  We spent about 4 hours then had tea, fruit juice drinks of sherbert & and Mais  (sour milk).
The part one has to maintain in these visits is ridiculous. For instance, Guide ahead with two officers in rear & 4 Sgts behind them, & even tho'  it is not a 1/4 of a mile, one must ride. The Sgts are bricks & carried out their part of the farce excellently.  They jump about as if the fear of God is in their hearts at the least look from & never give the show away.
