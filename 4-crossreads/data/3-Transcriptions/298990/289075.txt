<p>Delville Wood 15/11/16  At about 11 am a Taube came over and dropped a bomb and soon after we heard a shell scream over.  It landed right in a tent and blew it to ribbons and also blew to pieces three officers of the 20th Batt.  Captn Rush Lieut Gavan Duffy and another.  A fourth was quite mad with shock from the sight of his mangled comrades.  Comparatively quiet morning on the part of our guns - probably because we are replenishing our stocks of shells. Fritz pounds away all the morning.  We cannot find out how things stand up there.  "C" Co comes out tonight and I am arranging for each man to have a nip of rum, a drink of hot tea and some stew and a blanket as soon as they arrive. Bazeley came down early  to complete arrangements. Being very cold stayed in blankets reading most of the day.  A few shells came over during the afternoon.  The one that landed this morning cut two officers completely in halves and scattered pieces of intestines and limbs for a hundred yards round.  An awful sight. P>J> Thorn wandered along about the gloaming having been in Egypt ever since the Gallipoli days.  Heavy cannonade about 5.30 pm and many gunflashes.  Things appear considerably mixed out in front and losses heavy but our people are doggedly hanging on.  Gas barrage was put up on our Flers Tr. this morning but without effect as the percentage of duds was high.  Two men Quinn and another were killed by direct hits.  Sent two of the old birds on leave to England this morning one of them was "J.C" so called from his celestial bearded face on Anzac.  Today has been intensely cold.  Turned in early. "C" Co. 80 strong (out of 139) marched in during the night and had a hot meal and warm bed on arrival.  Some shells landed close round during the night and adjoining camps had to be vacated by their occupants.  It froze hard.  Leave men returned &ndash; ports closed.</p>
