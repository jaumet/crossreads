A heavy6 wind accompanied by rain sprang up after breakfast this morning it was no time before I was feeling anything but gay to make matters worse I had pains in the stomach. I felt crook the whole day had no dinner nor tea but laid on my coils of rope right up till 8? oclock tonight when we entered Colombo, there was nothing much to be seen only a row of lights a lighthouse throwing out warnings.
Was doing a bit more sewing a little while ago managed to run the needle right through my fore-finger
There is a chance of us not going ashore at Colombo for it appears we have a patient with meningitis aboard, if true we will be kept in isolation for this is an infectious disease they operated or inoculated him this evening
