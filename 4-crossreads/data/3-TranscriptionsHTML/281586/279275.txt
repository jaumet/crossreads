<p>"My Creed"<br/>Because I hav'nt a creed in the world<br/>As creeds in the creed books go<br/>There are those who hold me condemned by God<br/>As I am by them below.</p>
<p>2<br/>But I feel, if I read the story right<br/>Of the Man of Bethlehem,<br/>I would rather trust my soul to His Love<br/>Than sit and be judged by them</p>
<p>3<br/>For creeds at best are man made things<br/>And man is mortal and vain<br/>And apt, if a sinner he sits to judge<br/>To break his own creeds in twain.</p>
<p>4<br/>But the Lord looks straight in the hearts of men<br/>And He judges our lives aright<br/>And He does'nt care for the creed you bare<br/>But the motives you have in sight</p>
<p>5<br/>For a thousand creeds which preach of Christ<br/>Are full of their own conceits<br/>And the line of demarcation is wide<br/>Where God and the creed book meets</p>
<p>6<br/>I hav'nt a creed that a Church would own<br/>But I reckon the Lord of Love<br/>Will open the Gate, if a chap lives straight<br/>And find him a place above.</p>
