<p>When Tristram James signed Royal Military College of Australia Order No.l 1 dated 3 April 1916 it was the last such order that he was to sign in his capacity as Adjutant of the College. This Order ended with the following words: "Lieut 6.H. Capes will act as Adjutant from 7th Inst." Official Army reports rarely clothe facts with any traces of eulogy for services rendered. The Annual Report of the College for 1915-16 to the Minister for Defence ran true to form and custom in this repect when it said: "The Adjutant, Captain T.B.W. James, of the College was permitted to proceed on active service in April 1916 and his duties are being performed by Lieut G.H. Capes., a convalescent officer and a graduate of the Royal Military College. "However, The Journal of the R.M.C. for 1915-1916 was more expansive and said: "Major T.B.W. James has left us to take a battery to the front. He was Adjutant of the College for five years and ...having grown up with the place, he understood all its ramifications, and we can safely say that no one worked more unselfishly than he to further the efficiency of the College. He always took the keenest interest in cadets, and did much to make their stay at the College a happy one." (p.76).</p>
