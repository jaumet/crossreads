  
 There is no doubt they thoroughly understand their work when they are through the school of instruction. It is a treat to see them drilling they are like machinery I dare say by the time you receive this Max & Bert will be looking forward to coming across. I have been anxiously waiting to hear what Bert has gone into. Have just been talking to N Tayt he is very down in his luck re his mail he says he hasent had a letter at all since leaving Sydney.There is no doubt this is a great place to get yourself into condition. At first one thinks they will never get used to the sand but after a week one doesn't notice it. Well father I am laying on my stomach in the tent writing this by candle light needless to say I am not the only one. Think I will have to close now Love to all from  Your sincere son  Clyde
