Monday Feb.28th
Turned out at 6.30 with the rest of the crowd. The first drill I have done for nearly 3 months. Rather a stiff morning drilling, curried stew for dinner, stretcher drill in the afternoon. Had our arms examined to see where we were last vaccinnated. Having plenty of marks I passed.
Tuesday 29th
Weather getting very hot. Kept busy pitching tents. Money lasting. Beer continues to fly. Peter came to see me and we went for a walk

Feb. 29th Cont.
around the camp finishing at the Y.M.C.A. where I met several chaps from Manly. Wrote Lill.
March 1st.
Stretcher drill again, jolly good exercise carrying Patients across the desert. Told off for Picket, so had afternoon off. Got quite a shock when 
 my name was read out, as I haven't done a picket since I've been in the 8th.
Pay Day received 100 P.T. went on my beat at 10, with Woodsy". Nothing doing.
Thursday 2nd 
On picket, Bill "Lane" and Townsend were to relieve us at 2 a.m. but they smelt the bacon Woods and I were cooking and came out to join us and also joined in the feast. We made some toast, and "Lane" produced some patent coffee with milk and sugar already mixed, so we had quite a banquet. Turned in about 2 and slept until Breakfast time. Passed away the time reading and sewing buttons on my pants. Time of parades altered. First parade 8.30 instead of 6.30. Breakfast at 7 instead of 7.45.
