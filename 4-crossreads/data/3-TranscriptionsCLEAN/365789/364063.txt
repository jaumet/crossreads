 The following reports received from the Official Press Representative with the Australian Imperial Force are published for general information:- 
 British Head-Quarters, France, 5th November. 
 This morning an Australian Force attacked the German trenches on one of the lower knuckles of the main ridge beyond Flers, down which the battle has been proceeding for the last six weeks.  The line went over in the middle of the morning.  They went very steadily at marching pace.  The men seemed to be looking at their feet most of the time, picking their way amongst muddy shell-holes.  Ahead of them the valley was a perfect cauldron of black, and white, and brown shell-bursts.  But beyond this again the sun was shining on the far green slopes leading up towards Bapaume clock tower.  All the while during the battle one could see Germans in twos and threes strolling down across the country in rear of their lines exactly as our men strolled about their own hinterland.  German shells soon began to fall behind the attacking line.  Supports vanished over the hill's edge into the battle in the valley.  Conditions were difficult owing to the recent rains, but for three hours they held the German trench.  About midday our troops were counter-attacked from the valley.  After fierce bomb fighting our men were driven out. 
 British Head-Quarters, 19th September. 
 This morning's despatch from General Head-Quarters mentions that the Canadians and New Zealanders took part in the battle of 15th September.  It is no secret that the Australians were not present - they had already been relieved
