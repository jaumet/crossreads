<p>69<br/>in securing a bottom berth.</p>
<p>During my residence I noticed a nasty smell coming up from underneath. Upon investigation it turned out to be a tin with some bully beef in it. The maggots had got into it and the result was a smell. I made a few remarks to the Sergt-Major here, I asked him if he would object if I spoke to him and upon saying no, I said he ought to whitewash his mouth. He let it pass.</p>
<p>We were put onto fatigue jobs here &ndash; passing sandbags from inside the tunnels, the miners were busy at work making additional (tunnels) dugouts and we were put on to help. It was whilst here a shell fell right alongside us, which turned out to be a "dud". I started to smoke again but soon turned it up, didn't seem to me to be the right</p>
