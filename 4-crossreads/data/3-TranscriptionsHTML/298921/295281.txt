<p>November, 1915<br/>Thursday 18<br/>Well I never got the sheep but passing one of men's Bivouac I asked him why he had his Biscuit tin covered with his <u>shirt</u> on the fire &ndash; i.e. Boiling. He lifted it &amp; there I saw a leg of mutton, but he kept it covered so as his enemies might not steal it from him. My share was some Chops. Very cold wet night, &amp; I'm glad to have my Gum boots but they are not good to climb in.<br/>Sad to relate the "Trawler" foundered with our Xmas Mails on board &amp; some of my Diary to you will be missing, but cannot be helped, the sea was very rough.</p>
