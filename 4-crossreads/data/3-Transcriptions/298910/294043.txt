<p>from this nerve racking din of war.</p>
<p>26/7/16  Wednesday</p>
<p>At Dressing Station "Nouveau Monde" quite a treat to know you are virtually out of harms way. Helping to dress all day &ndash; tho things are very quiet. It was as good as a tonic, after coming from the trenches to receive 2 letters, one from G. Hegerty &amp; M. Single.</p>
<p>27/7/16  Thursday</p>
<p>Raw cold day &ndash; very hazy. Got letters from Grace, Mrs O'Kelly &amp; Annie &ndash; Had the day to myself, but to be in readiness to proceed anywhere. Got in a few very nasty cases &ndash; Heavy bombarding all through the night &amp; today &ndash; South of Laventie. One thing that was very noticeable right through the busy times was the <u>absence of N.C.O.'S</u>to take any responsibilitys near the firing line, not one can boast of being within 3 miles &ndash; There is absolutely no chance whatever of promotion in this Unit.</p>
<p>28/7/16  Friday</p>
<p>Very nice day &ndash; sunny. Heavy fighting and heavy bombarding on our left at Armentiers. Aeroplanes very busy. At 8 of our planes</p>
