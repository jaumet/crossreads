<p>1918<br/>May 20<br/>that even if the Hun did get a direct hit, he could not do much damage. We soon came in sight of the old town of Amiens, its cathedral showing well above the rest of the town. Branching off to the left we passed near defence lines that had been dug in case the Hun made any more big advances. As we went on the traffic became more numerous and we began to realise that at last after seven weeks travelling through back areas were returning towards the fighting zone. We passed through Poulainville and Allonville and had dinner in a wood. Then on again over the open hills till we got into the valley again at Bussy less aours. We pulled into a billet here intending to stop a few hours and then go on, so while we were waiting we went for a swim in a lagoon nearby. It was the first swim I had had since leaving Aussie. About 5 pm we were all waiting in line ready to move off when the order came that we were to stay the night there. The Hun bombed the village that night, dropping his load about 300 yards</p>
