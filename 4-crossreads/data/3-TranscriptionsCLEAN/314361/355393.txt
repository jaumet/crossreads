  
 in the dark, then on reaching the main road to Albert, a traffic controller got a lift for us in a motor lorry, & was taken into Albert, which is about eight miles from Merricourt. From Albert I & a few others went to the details camp which is just outside. We stayed there the night, slept in a tent & got breakfast there also, there I picked up another 55th man & we were sent on, was told that the [indecipherable] was near Montanban. Well I had about a seven or eight mile walk that morning, ate our dinner at a YMCA tent on the way. At about 2.30 pm we met some of the battalion going to this camp, so we just followed them. This is a terrible mud hole of a place, there are duckboards to walk on, to keep one up. I saw on a road here horses & transports, the horses pulling through slushy mud, up to the axle of the waggons, it was a terrible strain on the horses. The battalion has just came out of the trenches & I think is moving back to billet in a couple of days. DernancourtDec 19th 16 Left Montanban about 10 Am arrived in this village about 1.45. Very muddy place, had a snow storm this afternoon
