We marched along the Es Salt &ndash; Amman road relieving 2 Sqdns of the 10th L.H. on outposts our objectives being Hill 2900 overlooking Ain Hemar &amp; high ground guarding an enemy advance from Amman or Ain es Sir. The 10th Regt reported that the enemy were holding hill 2900 in some force. The Regt was ordered to attack this position "A&amp;B" Sqdns in advance &amp; "C" in support. The enemy however withdrew &amp; we captured Ain Hemar &amp; Hill 29000 without opposition. At 1100 we formed our outpost line covering all roads in the vicinity. Excellent water was found at Ain Hemar from a running stream also good grazing. At 1900 we recd orders to withdraw; but owing to a thick fog were unable to withdraw some of our outpost lines until late. Meanwhile Brigade Hdgrs had moved from their position to the Es Salt road &amp; much delay was caused by our having to send out patrols to discover their whereabouts. It was nearly midnight before we joined up. The Bgde then marched past Es Salt about 2 miles along the main road to Shunet Nimrin &amp; halted at 0300 on May 2nd.
