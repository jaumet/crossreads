 Breakfast . Mutton tea bread (usual ) extrem use for kill porpois , Dinner Mutton bread ( but no tea ) Supper Mutton tea bread . The monotoni of the cours was somewhat reliev by plum duff ( just as weighti as the befor mention bread ) for dinner tin herring for tea . The monotoni of the daili routin was also reliev by the news that a sailor lost 10 at "banker" , that an individu ( whether sailor or soldier we do not know ) was captur as a spi just as he threw the sight of one of our 4.7s over board . He was remov to the " Sydney " where in all probabl he will be shot . Lucki dog !
