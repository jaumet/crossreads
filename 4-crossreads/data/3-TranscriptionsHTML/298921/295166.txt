<p>July, 1915<br/>Wednesday 14<br/>I hardly like to keep writing from Egypt, but I suppose we are doing our bit with the Horses &amp; our time will come. We put in about 15 hours a day from 5 a.m. to 9 at night so keep fairly fit:-<br/>The returning fit for duty from the Hospitals are quite superior to the poor lads who are waiting to go &amp; few remember I suppose that I have been all through it before &amp; I know the Hospital routine from South Africa &ndash;</p>
