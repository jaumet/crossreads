 General Birdwood paid us a visit. Applications were invited from the Stretcher Bearers of our Ambulance to attend an Officers School for Commissions in the Infantry, some 20 applied &ndash; I was nearly going to apply but, I thought it better to be a live coward than a Lance Jack Lieutenant with a D.C.M. &amp; wooden cross. The Ambulance is running a Canteen &amp; is proving quite a boom, the trouble is we cannot get sufficient supplys.
