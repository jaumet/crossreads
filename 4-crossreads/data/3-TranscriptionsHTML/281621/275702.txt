<p>Sunday 10<br/>Hinted that I shall go on convalescent soon.</p>
<p>Tuesday 12<br/>Afternoon drive to Keston Common between Farnborough &amp; Bromley in Kent. We were entertained by &amp; at the home of Mrs Wheeler Bennett which is situated in beautiful grounds. The route out lay past the Chrystal Palace &amp; along the fringe of the Surrey Hills &amp; back, through the suburbs.</p>
<p>Wednesday 13<br/>Apparently there was an air raid on London this morning at 11.45. I saw the shells from Archies bursting but not the planes. Rumour says that Bank Cannon St &amp; Ludgate Hill were bombed but know nothing of casualties.<br/>Went before a board this morning &amp; I suppose I will soon be going convalescent. <br/>Major Wilson &amp; his wife have just been in &amp; they tell me that poor Reg Shergold has died of wounds.</p>
<p>Thursday 14<br/>In yesterdays raid over four hundred wounded &amp; ninety killed &amp; much damage done.<br/>Drive &amp; outing to Box Hill Surrey where we had tea at Burford Bdge Hotel. A great day Surrey with its villages roads, fields, hills &amp; trees like Kent baffles all adjectives of description. The most beautiful imagineable.</p>
<p>Friday 15<br/>Beautiful weather still. Fine concert this evening figuring Mr Theo Ward musical advisor to Sir Thos Wyndham &amp; artists from London Theatres</p>
<p>Saturday 16<br/>A day in London. At Shaftesbury Theatre "Il Trovatore" by the Carl Rosa Opera Co. not as good a company as Quinlan.<br/>Further hints at going convalescent.</p>
