it is possible, for we are out to beat them and they are a long way from that as yet, though I'm sure they are feeling the pinch bodily, and we have the upper hand, theres no one would be more pleased than I if it finished shortly but now we have fought this long I would like to see them beaten properly and for good. There has been a fair number of trench feet passing through here, some of them very bad quite black.
19th Same old job again but one good thing the hard frost of last night made the mud as hard as a metalled road, when I went out to have a wash this morning I found all the taps frozen so I had to go and break an inch of ice in a shell hole and duck into that.
About 2 o'clock this afternoon
