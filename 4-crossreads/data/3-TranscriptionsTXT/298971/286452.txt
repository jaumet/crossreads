 From our post tonight we carried about 17 cases in a few hours, distance 1&frac12; miles.  We are all exhausted.  Infantry with us say it's the hardest work ever they were asked to do.  Two of us found cover in a hole with a stretcher across the top for shelter.  We sat in here all night without any sleep. 
 3rd November (Friday) 
 At midday moved out to Goose Alley again.  Nearly blown up on the way.  Shells landed all round us when near Flers.  Rush of cases during.
