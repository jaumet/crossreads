<p>[Friday 17 November 1916]</p>
<p>Did you ever hear of a man called Rooke, he is a Lieutenant on this boat &amp; belongs to Artillery now, an awful outrider tells every one he is an Australian &amp; was born in Widgiewa, I've <u>not</u> disclosed the fact to him that I was born there, he says he knows Deniliquin well, but does not know me or mine.<br/>I dreamt of the old home last night, &amp; the bathroom etc:-  if you have any L.S.D. of mine spend it on a Wardrobe for the spare room with glass big enough to see full length.  Don't smile but I am looking forward to the day when I can bring my wife to Bronte.<br/>How long mighty Father how long! &amp; this is one of her weaknesses- a full length mirror: but I am only joking</p>
