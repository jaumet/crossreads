It is Sunday morning, I may have a few moments in between the duties of a soldier, so I once more attempt to speak with you.
As I have said before we are now the 7th Training Battalion and nearly 2,000 strong.
There is so much of interest to write about that when one find only a few minutes for the purpose it is difficult to begin. Thoughts, for a spell can no more than mark time. Yet so much is a soldiers training that which teaches him to think and act quickly I must at once attack the enemy from entrenchments of my memory.
I was going to say O for that leisure an artist or an author yearns for, but after all they who have done things worth the doing have done so during the stress of duties [indecipherable]
