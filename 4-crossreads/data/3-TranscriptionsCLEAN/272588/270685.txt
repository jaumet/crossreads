  
 Wednesday 3 AprilWet to-day. A walk round to Remi Siding & round the district. The view of Poperinge through the trees & hop poles & across the waving wheat fields is fine, exactly what I pictured of Flemish scenery. This is the third time I have been in this district & I like it, in spite of its flatness & occasional objectional smell caused by the manuring of the fields. Nothing doing on the Somme but we entrain for there soon. 
 Thursday 4 April Still wet & cloudy. A walk round old haunts round Poperinghe.
