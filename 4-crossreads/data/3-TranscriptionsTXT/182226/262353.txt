 Saturday 27 November, 1915 
 Met Sid at the Olympia Club at about 10.45. He beat me at billiards for the first time. 
 Money being short I had dinner &amp; came back to camp &amp; left Sid to look up some friends etc as he still had a few bob left. 
 I called into St Georges hospital &amp; gave the nurses some prints of some photos I had taken a few days before. 
 I came back to camp just in time as I had been wanted &amp; was told to report so I did &amp; was told to hold myself ready to go to Goza [Gozo]&nbsp;an island a few miles from Malta. I will try &amp; get out of it.
