  
 tired & hungry the place being very poor looking, wet & dreary. The billets also were poor & the men very wrath. I was dead tired by the time I had seen everyone billeted. Tuesday 8th Oct.  A very trying day. The billets were spread over the village & it was about a mile to do the Round. This I had to do several times, arranging extra billets, all left to me as the officers went away for most of the day. Had breakfast at 8.30 & parade at 9.30, the men marching to a central position. Arranged each section to do its own cooking, thus causing competition, the men gaining by improvement in cooking. I was billeted in a room at our mess, a fine bed & spent a glorious night between sheets. Things much more cheerful by daylight, but on the whole it's a poor place for a rest, the roads being poor & extras hard to get, no shops & only one estaminet. Fixed up a reading & recreation room, arrangements having been made to obtain books & such things. Arranged for Canteen with a Sgt. in charge which will be an improvement on our late canteen
