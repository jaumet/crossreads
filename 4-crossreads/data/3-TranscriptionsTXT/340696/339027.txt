125very heavily. Camped in a barn & had a lively night X.
31-3-18 Still at St Gratien spent a pleasant evening with some civilians who thought the Aussies were some   soldiers. I recited "How the Chestnut Horse came home" had some great fun.
1-4-18 Left for Esbart again & issued in the Chateau grounds. Found a better billet this time had a house to ourselves.
3-4-18 Left Esbart for Behencourt where we stayed for a few weeks enjoying ourselves. Fritz made it willing now & again two Tommies were wounded opposite our front door.
Played the 34th Battery (Tommies) football & beat them twice. Played wing 3/4 & in the second match I scored a nasty knee but thanks to the 12th Fld Ambulance it was soon mended.
