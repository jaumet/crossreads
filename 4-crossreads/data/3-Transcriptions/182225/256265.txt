<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; SATURDAY 27&nbsp;&nbsp; MAY</p>
<p>No sun yet, but there was no wind today which was something to be thankful for. The 27<sup>th</sup> Battery put 4 teams against the 35<sup>th</sup> Bat. 9<sup>th</sup> Brigade Queensland and we each won two pulls. In the afternoon there was boxing tournaments in the afternoon. Just 3 round &quot;no decision&quot; bouts; but there were some tip top goes. Its Linda&#39;s birthday to day - her 21<sup>st</sup>. I would give anything to be with her for the day, but hope to be there next year, although I think I will be lucky to be home for her 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
