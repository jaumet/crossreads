we do not get much news here as the the paper only prints the German's fightsI had another letter from Aunt Florrie She writes me nice letters. I have sent one letter to her and am sending another by this mail. She told me to be sure & come to her place if I go to England. I don't think there is any chance of that yet a while. We have no idea when we will go. It will not be for a month yet. We have a lot of training to do yet.Give my love to Jess & Marguerette & Jack also all the Friends Kindly remember me to them & tell them we are in great heart hoping you are all very well & enjoying the best of health. With all my love & kissesYour loving SonTom
