 11/5/18 Franvil Slept all night in a bivouac that was a rude enough shelter . The littl canva cover was dug down about 2 feet below the level of the surround clover patch . Despit cold and too much air we all slept well . The day broke dull and chilli and look like rain . There is a great tendenc among our men to get hold of irregular dress . The morn when the hors went to water two men were wear cap and two other wear cap comfort . Intend to give Burk the SO a rous in up about this . Breakfast out in the open field . There is noth but green grass and young crop everywher . Last night was talk to two old Frenchmen who recal the War of 1870 and the Battl of Pont Noyell . These men were plough but their work as they said was "without heart " for they never know when an enemi advanc will ruin all their labour and everyth will destroy . The spirit of this wonder French nation is marvel . In the villag the littl children and the women carri on where troop have been shift out owe to the place be consid unsaf . The cellar is a veri present help to them and their refug in case of need . All have their gas mask of a French pattern for use in case of need .
