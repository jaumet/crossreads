  
 Sunday 23 December 1917 Off 10 to 1, sewed apron & talked S. Watson (on duty once again poor girl). Very cold day & fine dust or mist in the air giveing a gray hazy appearance even as short a distance as the tents. Regret not having sent a cable home but what could one say?, for 1918 shall send one. Quiet in Connaught, 38 pts.  All well save Adams, N.Z., shot in chest & lung.  R. Op. 30.32, T.103 etc., P.120 & cond. not improving. No fighting up the line for some days so convoys are less heavy. No home letters since the first batch.
