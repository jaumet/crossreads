<p>There are fresh rumours of the near approach of a definite clearing out of private billets of those occupying them. I hope it will clear over.</p>
<p>The weather during the past few days has become much colder, &amp; dull. Today it is drizzling &amp; the outlook is far from inspiring.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon the sun shone for a time &amp; the village had the usual happy &amp; holiday look. News arrived at midday on that day, of the acceptance by Germany of the points of Wilson's speech, &amp; of his willingness to evacuate the conquered territory. In stipulating for a mixed commission to arrange the evacuation, however, she gave a bad impression. This was not appreciated till Monday when the full comments came out, so it appeared on that sunny Sunday afternoon.</p>
