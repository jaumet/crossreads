We were staying stay here all day & when I am relieved, I discover a waterhole about a mile away.  I have a beautiful swim & don a clean shirt.  On reaching camp again I have a shave - and - I am myself again, but I wonder when & where I shall have the next wash & shave.  We move off again at dusk.  Our objective is Tiberius.  The 11th Regiment have taken Samakh, but have had to fight for it.  They have lost 3 officers & some 30 men but the town is ours & the enemy are escaping by motor boat across the sea of Galilee & by motor lorry to Safed.  Tiberius has also fallen after some resistance.  I learn all this by listening in on the ???? line
We jog along the dusty road  the atmosphere still redolent of decomposed Turk.  It is quite dark & I can see nothing through the clouds of dust.  About 9 pm we pass
