<p>No. 21 Camp, Larkhill<br/>Tuesday, 7th. Novr. 1916</p>
<p>My Dear Parents/.<br/>"Letter for you to-day Boys - letter for you to-day" the mail call have just rang out on the Bugle. It is the most welcome sound the Bugle ever makes. All day long it is blaring out some call or other which demands immediate obedience. The worst of all is the "Get out of bed, Get out of bed - get out of bed <u>Quick"</u> which disturbs and terminates our repose in the early hours of the morning. To some the Defaulters call of "You can be a defaulter as long as you like but you have to come when you're called" is still worse - ringing out as it does at every spare moment during the day until 10 p.m. at night demanding the attendance of all who are undergoing punishment for a half hours pack drill. Luckily this is not my bugbear as I have escaped being crimed up to the present.<br/>The "Fall in A. fall in B, fall in every Company" is equally repugnant and the Bugles final blatant blare of "Lights Out - Lights Out" generally sounds when one is in the middle of a letter or an interesting story. Sometimes it sounds when we are at work and then we disregard it. A.M.C. work overrules most orders,</p>
