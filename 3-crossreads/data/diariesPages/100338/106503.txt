March

my address being changed that I have missed them. They have probably been returned to the Base Post Office at London.

This sickness has been the cause of my missing two boats to Australia. When I get out of here it will be another month of waiting before I will be able to get attached to another Boat Roll.

15-3-19 Since the last entry my throat has been very sore, for two days I was unable to eat or drink anything.

The passage of my throat was completely blocked up, If I attempted to swallow any food or drink, it would be forced back through my nose.

Yesterday the 14th of March the Doctor said he was going to put my case before the Medical Board and have me returned to Australia by Hospital Ship. That will mean that my return will be delayed for a month or more. I am still confined to my bed,
