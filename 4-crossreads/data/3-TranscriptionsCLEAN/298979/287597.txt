  
 In Hospitals the Reveille is sounded about 6 O'clock in Summer & Seven in Winter when all Walking "Cases" arise & make their own beds, & help the orderlies (in Tommy Hospitals the VADs) to make the beds of the others, & join in cleaning up the Ward. 
 In Summer time, twice a week the floor is washed & scrubbed out with brooms & mops. Breakfast is served. Soon after 9 am the Doctor starts to make his rounds. Accompanied by the Matron or Sister he carefully examines each patient & gives instructions as to treatment etc. After leaving the Sister & Nurses then start the process of dressing the wounds which every one is glad when finished, particularly the patients with bad wounds. 
 The men are then allowed to take it easy till Dinner is served. For "Cases" necessary, the second dressing is then proceeded with, after which all "Walking Cases" are allowed to leave the Hospital & may roam about within a radius of four miles. 
 A time is fixed when every one has to return & also for lights out, when roll call is taken & every man must be in bed. Any one failing to answer is reported to the orderly room & dealt with according to his power of being able to invent the most plausible tale or excuse. 
 Of course "cases" requiring dressing 3 or even 4 times a day must remain in the Ward. Tea is served about 5 or 5.30 & supper half an hour before "lights out". 
 Excepting in the most severe cases the Doctor has only time to visit each Ward once a day & sometimes may even have to miss a day now & then. 
 The work performed by the whole of the Staff, Doctors Sisters & Nurses VADs etc is wonderful & calls for the very highest praise for the skill care patience, kindness, gentleness and unceasing attention, so quietly & uncomplainingly shown, even with the most irritating, worrying & trying "Cases".
