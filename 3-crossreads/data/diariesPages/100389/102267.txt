25th Raining. The ground is now decidedly worse. The mud now lies in pools, in some instances 3 ft deep. We have been issued with Field Service Knee boots but these are useless once they are wet. Matters could not be worse. My feet are still giving me hell!
All day there was a heavy artillery duel and about 8.30 pm "Fritz" gave us a repetition of the 23rd inst. tho’ luckily for us he did not come so close – anyhow it was close enough to make us huddle up and at the same time putting the fear of God into us. Some men say they like the life! They are liars. No one does. And there is many a time that I would give anything to be 1000 miles away. I have had & seen all I want now and will be glad to get out of it.
26th Still raining. There is no need to mention the ground as it is just the same,
