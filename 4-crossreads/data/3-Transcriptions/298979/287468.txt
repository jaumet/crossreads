<p>When in Camp or in billets the special desire of all men is of course "Pay Day", but whether they are in billets, Camp, or the line, the fact being known that a "Mail" has arrived invariably creates the greatest excitement &amp; then "parcels".</p>
<p>Immediately it is known that a mail has arrived, if it has to be sent for, say to Company Head Quarters five or six miles back, urgent messages are given "Dont forget mine", "I expect about seven this time" "You're no bally good unless you bring one for me" &amp; such like. On arrival of the treasured bag great eagerness is depicted on all faces as the name and number on each letter is called out. The lucky recipients utter a shout of joy &amp; fondly handle the letter or letters as if the paper was animated, &amp; they carefully spread themselves out for a good hearty read at their ease.</p>
<p>When a parcel is received the lucky owner &amp; all his neighbours give a good hearty cheer</p>
