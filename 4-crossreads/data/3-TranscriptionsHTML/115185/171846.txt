<p>At Sea<br/>21. July 1915<br/>Off the coast of Spain?</p>
<p>My dearests Jocelyn &amp; Rosamond<br/>There is nothing so far to tell of interest.<br/>I'm on a very comfortable ship, which left England on Sunday at 8.30 pm.<br/>I cannot write anything about the people on board. I have not met the man your little friend mentioned but he might &ndash; be on one of the other ships that left about the same time.<br/>There are only 30 of us on this ship &ndash; but I have two others in my cabin. There is a wardrobe &amp; many drawers</p>
