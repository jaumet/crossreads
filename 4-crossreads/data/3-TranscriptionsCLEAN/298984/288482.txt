Monday 5thA beautiful day. But then I prefer the air on this coast to any where else I have been The sea is like a harbour  little white capped ripples a shade darker blue than the sky. The coast is in sight most of the time  does not look inviteing - a hard careless sort of coast - like its inhabitants Victorians & Tasmanians paid today. Band took up a colection in aid of its self  Gambling in full swing
