 Dear Father &amp; Mother A day of great excitement. Have at last started on the long trip home. It makes me feel pretty sentimental. Many a time have I little expected to start for home. 
 Left the School at 1 o'clock &amp; train started at 3.30. Shall be at Havre France for about 5 days &amp; then go to England. Got two letters from you today. 
 The train is shaking too much to write
