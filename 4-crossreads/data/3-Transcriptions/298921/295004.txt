<p>January, 1915<br/>Sunday 31<br/>Today I posted at Port Said my Diary - &amp; will hold on now until I hear from you as to whether you receive it before sending more as all letters are still under Censor.<br/>In company with 3 other officers we did the slums of Port Said the seamy side of life, the dregs of the world &amp; the dirtiest city:- Pigs, Goats, Dogs, Fowls run freely about the street &amp; I did not see a single Motor. We move into the Mediteranean today &amp; disembark tomorrow morning at Alexandria, but got little news of the world; or the war, Torpedoes guard entrance of Canal &amp; Hydroplanes &amp; Aeroplanes fly overhead.</p>
