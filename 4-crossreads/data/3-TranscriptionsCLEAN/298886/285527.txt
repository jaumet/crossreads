 That's what happened 12 months to night and to night 12 months after I am riding in the train from Upper to Lower Egypt the war still on and we are going to a fresh Camp nearer the Suez Canal.

 15th  April MAY. 5 days after discharge! MONDAY. KANTARA. 
 It is now 0640 and a lovely cool breeze blowing and we are just settled down for our first night bivouac at Kantara in the Canal Zone. Well I dont know what to think so far it's a long way to go for water and the sand is soft. The night breezes are a treat here although it is hot during the daytime. We are informed that we must be prepared soon to move out into the desert
