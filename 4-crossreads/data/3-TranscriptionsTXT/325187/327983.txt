 Off Malta  Sister Calvert knows Bob MacFarland's sister is among the Nursing Staff on board, we had a great yarn about old Hay. &amp; the folk there. War news is published daily all's well   Im horribly weak intended to walk about &amp; get fit, but find the stairs enough.  Time will fix me up- but I'm bandaged so tight I can hardly breath  in the rotten foul air below  Usual routine, Boat drill Dressings, Sleep, game of bridge, etc. Can only find 2 Australian Soldiers &amp; 1 new Zealander on board, they were glad to find someone who spoke  "the Colonial twang"  &amp; looked like a Convict, with close cropped HAIR
