 1916   WEDNESDAY 27   DEC. 
 Fine & frosty. We had a full marching order parade, all mounted in morning. We took all guns, waggons, cooks cart water cart ect over on the plain then came back again. Mother & Struan came out at dinner time to say good bye Poor Mother was very cut up but held out bravely. She had just got word that Alan had gone back to France again today for duty. It must have been hard for her to lose both of us in a couple of days & not to see one of us. Cleaning up  harness  huts ect in afternoon. I was on Picket at night.
