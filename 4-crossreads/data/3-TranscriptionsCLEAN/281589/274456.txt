We walked to just the other side of Pozieres (about 1 1/2 miles or so) There is a memorial there to the 1st Division & 4th Battalion A.I.F. & a mile beyond is several tanks, some badly knocked about. We got a lift into Bapaume (about 7 miles) and then walked out to our C.Section headquarters about a mile or so out at Favreux. I received 17 letters on my arrival.
