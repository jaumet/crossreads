<p>and beyond learning that coal is &pound;8 per ton and observing that there</p>
<p>are no lighting resitrctions as in England, I know nothing about the</p>
<p>place.&nbsp; The immunity of Paris from Zeppelin attack is popularly</p>
<p>attributed to a good system of Anti aircraft defences, but I am in-</p>
<p>clined to think that it is the long overland journey which makes the</p>
<p>voyage unpopular amongst Zeppelins, added to which of course is the</p>
<p>undisputable fact that the Germans&#39; principal hate is directed against</p>
<p>England and not France.&nbsp; The only well known spot in Paris which I</p>
<p>saw whilst driving through in the dark (we WERE permitted to have the</p>
<p>blinds up in the taxi) was the site of the storming of the Bastille</p>
<p>whereon is erected a monument and I fancy the French people sort of</p>

<p>picturesque railway journey in the World, and it would certainly be</p>
<p>hard to beat.&nbsp; La Ciotat and Toulon are passed within an hour or two</p>
<p>from Marseilles butx it is not until you get along towards Cannes that</p>
<p>what is generally known as the Riviera begins, and from here on to the</p>
<p>Italian border no expense has been spared to make the district ideal</p>
<p>for the worlds holiday seekers.&nbsp; Cannes, Cagne, Antibes, Nice, Ville</p>
<p>Franchi, Monarco, Monte Carlo and Mento all have their special attract</p>
<p>ions and judging by the immense hotels at all these places, the</p>
<p>travellers appear to spread themselves well.&nbsp; Menton which is</p>
<p>practically on the Italian border is my destination and here one of</p>
<p>the largest hotels in the Riviera (The Cap Martin Hotel) is being used</p>
