 1st L.H.B. Races today. Bales of Tibbin made the Handles, the Butchers Scales on the Shafts of the Medical cart for Weighing in, Cartridge Pouches for Lead Bags & Armlets of Bandages with No. in indelible INK in lieu of Saddle Cloths. The Trumpeter sounded the saddle up & Starters, Empty Biscuit TINS marked the Saddling Paddock & Track, & notwithstanding an enemy Plane flew over to have a look we had a really good days sport. I won 12/-/-- in a sweep, but did not start my own horses as they are not built to gallop.
