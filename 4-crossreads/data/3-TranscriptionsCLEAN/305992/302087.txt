  
 28.9.18 The officers of the H.M.T. Malwa came on board today & told us that they had sighted 2 periscopes 18 hours out from Taranto bound to Port Said full of troops. A torpedoe struck the Malwa & failed to explode. She was dock at Taranto the following trip & the plates were dented badly. They fired 3 shots from their howitzer & they claim to have caused the distruction of one . The depth charge at 500 yards range exploded below the serface a few feet away from the periscope. The Jap distroyers 2  made for them & claim to have sunk another with their hugh depth charges. The Malwa's last shot fired took a long time to explode & consequently one of Jap. distroyers steaming at high speed got so near that part of the bomb actually landed on their forecastle head. After wards they lowered a boat from the distroyers & actually picked up a torpedoe that had hit the Malwa & failed to go off
