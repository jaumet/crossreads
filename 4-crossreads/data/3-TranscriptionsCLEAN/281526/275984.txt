25/11/17 Mt. KemmellChurch parade in the Cinema Hall. A sunny day, but the sun has no strength and a cold biting wind made it most unpleasant out of doors. Padre Lamble took the service which went well. For lunch Capt Bean came in and we had interesting arguments. After lunch there was a football match H.Q. v D Coy but the perishing wind made it cold for the onlookers. From the slopes here is a fine view for miles in all directions over what is possibly the flattest country in the world. After mess Alderson (just back from Paris) lectured on esprit de corps and I then followed on the same topic and covered many points of the officer's duty. Our anteroom is very cosy and lends itself to anything of this nature well. Our strength in officers is now well up and the family is large. [Blotted out] is the M.O. And a decent chap but very boyish for his majority. A moonlight windy night with roar & roll of guns.
