Turks yelling for all they were worth but in spite of all the shooting not a bird fell, but some of them came down very low.On the 10th we had a very severe storm & the trenches in places were nearly flooded out, it was just a taste of what we were going to get when winter came in, nearly  everyone got wet through & a good few dugouts fell in but fortunately no one was buried but one good thing about Gallopoli soon as ever it had finished raining the weather cleared up & the sun would come out.I don't know what we would have done without the mules at Anzac" I reckon we would have starved you
