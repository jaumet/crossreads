I then went back to these people had supper & 2 other chaps & I rode back on our bikes Len having decided to stop the night, it was a glorious night & I really enjoyed our midnight trip, but half way I got a puncture which we soon fixed up, I eventually arrived home at 1.30 as I was coming across the parade
