A word or two about the camel may be useful may possibly be of use to some of you who by way of expiation or other motive find themselves in the desert with a camel for the only means of transport.  (to the reader but don't say read)
He is beautiful to draw & paint but he is an animal I cannot love.  Never attempt to caress a camel.  If he should try to caress you & he will if you are not watchful hit him with anything that is handy & heavy, the butt of the rifle, an army boot hobnailed or the Colonel's best folding armchair.  Hit him on the Jaw & hit hard.  When mounting screw his neck right round until you as if you were trying to dislocate it & snub him short so that he can't bite, his bite is fateful fatal.  When on him much may be forgiven for with little urging he keeps up his not unpleasant shamble for with regularity & persistency.  On dismounting revert to the original antagonistic attitude.  The only bond between man & camel is mutual hate.  The common bond of man & camel is undying hate.
