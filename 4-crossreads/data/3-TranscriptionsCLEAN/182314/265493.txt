Dear Sir,
I was very grateful to you for having come to meet me last evening and assisting me to get through the dreaful congestion in Macquarie Street. Without you and Mr. Stoney I should have been there till midnight, and I am most grateful for the trouble you took to extricate my car.
Yours sincerely,
