<p>would  light up the camp. They come a long way, you can't hear the report of the guns. The French were firing all night. 15 horses belonging to the 15th B.A.C. / R.H.A. were killed outright last night. A man belonging to the Drake Batt, hit with a fuze in the arm, almost tore his arm off. This was absolutely the worst night I have put in so far. The dust and stones were flying all over our lines. Early in the night a shell burst about 100 yards from our lines, the nose of it landed on the top of my dugout, it was a 5 &frac34; inch. Today is again windy and dusty. I have just issued small calico bags filled with sulphur, to hang around our necks supposed to keep away vermin. The health of the troops is bad the worst desease is dysentry 90% of our men suffer from it, they send a lot away to Malta. I have seen some deplorable cases, men at the latrines all night long. Of course we have been inoculated against Cholera. Some of the doctors say that this dysentry is a mild attack of Cholera. At present the food is very good. Bread, fresh meat, onions, rice, rasins, currants</p>
