<p>21st November 1916.Hod El Ge'eila .Tuesday<br/>Suddenly received orders this morning to pack up and go to BIR-EL-AB in full marching order, we went there to be "dipped" as the boys express it ie fumigated. Some of the men have contracted lice in this bivouac left behind by the 3rd Brigade and as a precautionary measure we had to put our clothes and blankets into large covered railway vans which were connected by means of steam pipes from the locomotive and some disinfectant, we all stripped off and first got into a bath of water into which a good deal of creosote had been placed, and after having had a dip we got out and put our cloaks on as a preventive against sun burn. Some had no cloaks with them or had put them with their other clothes in the fumigator and so for about an hour had to run about in the sand in their bare pelt, that is what some people call art isn't it?</p>
