<p>other two Battalions in seperate companies with their own officers &amp; N.C.O.s<br/>We heard this evening that General Jellibrand met the delegates and had a long talk with them, resulting that they would be supplied with rations and they were to carry on as a Battalion. Also that the Padre bought a large box of tinned fish to give the men their dinner. The men had a concert &amp; meeting in the evening &amp; the padre was vigorously cheered.</p>
<p>Sunday Sept 22. 1918. 1510<br/>A fine day. We are all to return to the 37 today. The battalion is to be rebuilt &amp; strengthened. Several including myself do not want to go back but rather remain here with this Battalion.<br/>The 38. Battalion is camped on the side of a ridge facing the ruined village of Allaines.<br/>Enemy aircraft were very active this morning. There was plenty of rain this evening &amp; the ground is very muddy.</p>
