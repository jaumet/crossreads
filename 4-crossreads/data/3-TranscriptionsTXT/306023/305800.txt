 I went along Victoria Street, where as an Australian I attracted a good deal of attention, some of it very unwelcome too on account of the gazers, to the Abbey.

One can imagine my chagrin when I found afterwards that it was a free performance. 
 By now it was pretty dark and the lamps were lighted. I was surprised to find that the streets are fairly well lighted up, not nearly so dark as I had expected.
