Sergt Sestilian also killed, this man had a very narrow escape a short time back whilst lying in his dugout- a large piece of broken shell hit him on the back making a terrible bruise. If the piece had come edge ways it would have cut him in half. Poor fellow he was well liked, & had a smile for everybody.
