Came over on L.N.W. Boat "Margaret", arrived Boulogne about 2 pm. This meant we were back in France once more. We came ashore and marched up the Famous "One Blanket Hill" to the Rest Camp, arriving there about 4 pm. After Tea and a wash, a number of us strolled into Town; but Funds being low there wasn't much doing and we soon returned and went to Bunk.

Left Blanket Hill and marched to station, boarded Train about 10 and came on to Le Havre, arriving here about 11 pm; at Harfleur station. Marched from there to Camp, arriving about 1.30. We were soon between the Blankets as it had been a very tiring day.

Food is good and plentiful in this Camp. After Tea wrote to Lill. Went to Pictures at Y.M., and Concert afterwards, both very good.

We are camped with the 3rd Div. The W.O. (Whitelaw) of the Post Office is in charge of us. We are not called on to do any Fatigues. The weather is very hot. After Tea Woodstock and I went for a stroll towards Le Havre but the M.P.'s turned us back before we got very far. There is some very pretty country around here.

Gee! talk about being hot, it's as hot here as it was up amongst the Sugar in Queensland. The sweat pours off one as one is eating one's meals. 
I wonder what B.E. will say when she hears I am back in France. Poor old Girl, that dear white forehead will be getting wrinkled over me.
After Dinner Saunders and I got Leave to Havre. It is a twopenny trip on the tram. We had Tea at a Yankee Y.M. which was a fine place. 2 eggs, Bread and Butter, Tea and Custard and Prunes for about 1 francs. We had a pretty good time. Met Bill Watson who used to work at Ma Kings.
