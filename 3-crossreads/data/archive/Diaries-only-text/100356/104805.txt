Revielle as usual
Went out as a troop this morning did heaps of troop drill under the SM we had on the whole a rough time too much walking but on the hole had a fairly decent time, finished up with a gallop my mare still retaining her reputation in the afternoon signalling instruction helio etc. I had to go over to the canal to cut rushes for the road which by the way isn't getting on as fast as it might, visited the peanut farm after scouring round succeeded in getting a feed, after tea lamp practice ensued. I had the fast lamp Norm the slow got it over about 9.30, arranged an N.C.O's flutter in the shape of a 4 furlong gallop at catch weights. Belcher is running a book on it up to now I'm favorite at 3 to 1 the race is to be run on Sunday morning at 7.30

Another bitterly cold night as I was C of Pic you may be sure I?d get trouble with the horses, feed up at 7.15, at 9 am I was warned to go with two men on patrol duty along the line took plans with us we started at 9.30 passing at 11 a place called Kattar a sort of wayside inn, the track was very suitable for motors patchy in very few places then only for a few yards off again and at 12.35 we came to a place called Beressh about 15 miles from Wardan, had dinner there, watered feed the horses had an hours rest saddled up went still further on passing through a grove of gum trees turned at 3.10 for home being then 26 kilometres from camp at an easy pace back as the race is for tomorrow arrived at 5.40 to find 4 letters awaiting me from home.
