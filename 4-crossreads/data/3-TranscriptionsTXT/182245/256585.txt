 11 SUNDAY 
 Fine but came up rain &amp; mist 
 in the evening. Cleaning 
 harness all day. Our half 
 holiday was postponed 
 till Wednesday on account 
 of the C.R.A coming round 
 tomorrow &amp; we had to clean 
 up everything. A Hun plane 
 came over &amp; got the baloon 
 near here. He had three or 
 four goes at it with a 
 machine gun &amp; finally 
 set it alight &amp; got away.
