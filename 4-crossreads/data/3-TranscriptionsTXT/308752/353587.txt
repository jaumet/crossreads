The owner was a very homely person, & the place suited me down to the ground, not flash neither was it expensive, but was very comfortable & clean. After having tea here I set forth to inspect this famous Blackpool, which I have heard so much about. I can assure you that I was very satisfied with my inspection.  The place was an eye opener to me. I had no idea the town was so big. I pictured in my mind a seaside resort like Manly, but the latter is not in it, there is no comparison between the two places. Blackpool is about ten times bigger than Manly & at times a million people have been staying here o I am led to believe.  Judging from the crowd I saw, there must be nearly this number here now. Everyone is out for pleasure & enjoyment, & girls, well, they're everywhere.  I dont think I have seen so many of the fair sex before, & coming from those ruined villages of France, it was a pleasure to see them all. A big surprise was in store for me. I visited the Tower Ball Room, & was amazed when I first saw it. The place was more massive & gorgeous than the Salon de Luxe, Sydney. Dancing had not started when I first arrived on the scene, but, on the first glance at the huge Ball Room, I knew I was set, & decided to stay at Blackpool for the remainder of my Leave. Dancing started at 7 p.m. all the latest dances were on the programme,
