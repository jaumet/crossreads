 Toma with the O.C. Garrison (Lt Comr. Brace-girdle). This is the place where Colonel Watson went on his famous march (vide "How Australia took New Guinea"). Particulars of the march were given in these pages some months ago. I was shown the places shelled by the "Encounter" on that occasion, and also the trenches shelled by the 12 pn. Field Gun of the Naval Reserve. Toma itself is an immense mountain &amp; the surrounding country resembles somewhat the South Coast districts of New South Wales. It is used by the residents of Rabaul &amp; Herbertshohe as a health resort, and a fine boarding house offers the necessary accomodation at a reasonable figure. On Sunday we again visited Kuradui for another "last gathering" as Dr. Runge (Government Medical Officer) laughingly remarked. He is returning to Sydney with us and the repeated preparations for departure amuse him exceedingly. Today (Tuesday) the natives gathered to bid us farewell &amp; gave a Duk Duk Dance for our benefit. 8 pm : I think we are really going home now; the "Navua" arrived this morning and about 100 of our men have gone to Rabaul to stow boxes &amp; heavy gear.
