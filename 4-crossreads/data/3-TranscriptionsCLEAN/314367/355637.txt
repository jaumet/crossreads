 Well - Xmas day was fine, cool & rainless - There is no doubt but that I put in a very good day - I saw much that was novel - Dinner was at 1 pm - I've kept the menu & on its back is inscribed the names of all the officers present - Duck was there & Tomato Soup & plum pudding - A man who wanted more  was  is a Sybarite -I went on shore about 10.30 - I had two jobs of work - one of which was seeing that you got some mail from me -  quietly  - I fixed all up & felt a free man - Natives had come in to Kawieu from all parts & there was singing & dancing - Many of the masks & Head dresses were very fine - I saw one - made of the feathers of the Torres Strait pigeon - black & white - very fine indeed - I spotted cockatoo & parrot & swamp pheasant feathers - I tried to blow their bamboo trumpets but c- not get a note - They get a rumble like thunder - The women & children came in - I gave cigarettes
