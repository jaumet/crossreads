  
 Being wounded. These last cases show a lack of proper attention owing to big influx of wounded or some such such cause. We had four amputations one night all of which I attended & gave a hand occasionally. One was prettily finished leg taken off at knee. The knee cap was cut in half & left to grow on end of stump this allowing the loose flesh on knee to be brought round the stump giving it a finish not obtainable in any other way. During this operation I was plentifully splashed from the artery. One evening I went off to the French camp for a night out, but it only resulted in a concert all in French. The artists were first rate however & especially one who sang Carmen was splendid. One general was present & several officers & the men were allowed to "take Off" their officers by means of songs & a kind of cinematograph which reflected figures a few inches in size. 
 20 & 21st Saturday Steady going in Dispensary allowing me to witness various operations. News of war rather discouraging Russia being driven back, Warsaw fallen two transports sunk but against that rumours of engagement in North sea resulting in various Germans being sent to the bottom.Let 'em all come. Our turn will come
