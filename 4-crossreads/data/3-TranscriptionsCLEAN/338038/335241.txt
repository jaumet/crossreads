France27.6.1916My dear Father & Mother,
This is my first letter from France so I have a fair amount to talk about of course but am afraid I must condense as one does not get a great deal of leisure in these parts.
We landed at Marseilles early in June & entrained there straight away for Northern France. That 3 days train journey I shall never forget! The first day's run through Southern France was absolutely like Heaven after coming out of the sand. Everything of course is beautiful just now, green everywhere, & the most beautiful shades imaginable. Every inch of the country
