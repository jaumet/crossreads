Spent a very miserable night there was a heavy fall of snow and there was no shelter from it in this open trench. One of our airmen was forced to do a deed of great daring today. He was flying home crippled and hardly able to make his machine go, when he was attacked by a big black Hun machine. When our machine was barely 200 feet up and right over No Mans Land, the Hun fired, then our chap unable to defend himself put his machine into a spinning nose dive, fell to within 30 feet of the ground where he regained control and flew off leaving the Huns discomforted and followed by our cheers.
