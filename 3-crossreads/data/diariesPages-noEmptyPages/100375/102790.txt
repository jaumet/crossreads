there was a notice to the effect that it was to be rung in case of a gas alarum
On our way from Doulieu to Estaires we noticed little mounds made marking positions for artillery this looked ominous.
Nearing the village of Estaires we found newly made trenches, strong posts and elaborate barbed wire entanglement
I had often heard rumours that Fritz was going to make an offensive but these signs which I have just mentioned seem to substantiate the rumour. Another thing that added more evidence was the fact that a light railway had been made only a short time ago.
When we reached square of the village of Estaires, we. found a brass band palying there, The children were playing in the street, the elderly people were going about dressed in there Sunday attired. This latter part seemed to take away from us the thought of war and transferred our thoughts to home and the Salvation Army Band playing in the streets.
The case of an Anti-Air Craft shell fell on the roadway just before we got to the spot.
