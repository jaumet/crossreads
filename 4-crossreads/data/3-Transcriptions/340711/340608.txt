<p>Yarned with Sgt. F. the whole evening.</p>
<p>We found a cool spot in a corridor just between the cold storage chamber and the butcher's shop, with the fresh night air coming over our heads. He is a very interesting fellow. He is a braggart, has been in delirium tremens for three days last week, but is outstandingly good-natured and without any pettiness.

He is afraid to die he says and yet he has</p>
