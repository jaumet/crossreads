<p>success in civil life that I ever would.<br/>We are a very happy community here - just like school boys. There are no grumblers in our tent thank Goodness, and very few, if any, in the camp. Of course we all have our little jokes at the food but they help our appreciation of it. All new men when they first come into camp are called Marmalades - as that is the usual jam.<br/>I have everything I could possibly require in the way of clothes &amp; money. In fact I am very sorry now that I did not leave more of both of them at home. The money is safe as I invested in a money belt and wear it constantly. I have left my port containing most of my clothes at Sharpe's and will take more of them in this week-end. We are allowed from 12 noon on Saturday till 12 noon on Sunday off but I intend applying for an extention till Monday morning.<br/>I purchased a small green wicker suit case for my clothes in camp. It has a lock and is all I require in that line and saves my Port.<br/>Sharpes have been exceptionally kind to me and treat me like one of their own boys. I go and come as I please and always find a nice bed ready for me.<br/>The last post has now sounded so I will conclude. I will write again and let you know how I am faring. I am sure the fine healthy life will agree with me. All the men here look [text missing].  I trust the firm will be able to secure a trustworthy clerk as I [text missing] it <strike>will be</strike>  is father who is doing the extra work [text missing] till then.<br/>I am afraid Hit's Home Nursing book will arrive a fortnight or so too late but trust it may prove of some use. In its leaves is a needle threader. The point of the wire is to be pushed through the eye of the needle, the cotton threaded through it, and then pulled through the needle. I hope it may prove useful for the machine and not like many new inventions, more trouble than the old method.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene</p>
