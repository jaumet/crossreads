Tuesday 2nd  [Feb]First impressions of Cairo will be lasting.  Arriving at 2am in the morning we soon got the horses out & the baggage loaded.  Each of us led 2 horses & had to walk to the camp at Maadi, 10 miles from Cairo. It was very cold, being winter here.  We got to the camp about 8am & were just about done.  All mess arrangements were upside down, but we managed to get a bite off some of the other lads here.  Had a couple of hours sleep in the afternoon.  Had a good shower bath & felt much better after it.  Eyes very sore with the glare of the sand & the dust blowing.
Wednesday 3rdReveille at 6am.  Exercising horses most of the morning.  I took on the job of cook for the troop for the day as the squadron cooks hadn't turned up.  We fared fairly well today.  Very cold during the night.  Went to see the pictures with Walter Kirton.
