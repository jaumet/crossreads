<p>We found ourselves in a maze of stables, now utilised as barracks, &amp; were told to find accommodation anywhere, as we leave for the Baltic early in the morning.   Geo. Ted. Sandy &amp; I camped in a "box" which had contained 5 bunks, only two of which were not tenanted.  Half of Ruhleben left yesterday;  the camp will be completely cleared tomorrow.   In the well appointed kitchen an excited cook who could already see Tyne-water in his mind's eye fell on our necks &amp; fed Ted &amp; I on cakes (such bonser cakes!) and tea, which we consumed in company with a young ex member of the Foreign Office (now a little blithered;  everybody is celebrating) who was a famous tragedienne of the Ruhleben stage.</p>
<p>Sun. 24th Nov.<br/>Barrack 13, where we slept, is peopled mostly by gents of doubtful nationality, with a smattering of "horsey" folk.   One of 'em said to Sandy "Your'e Thcotsth, aren't you?   Why, I'm Thcotsth too!"   Sandy actually sniffed audibly;  Geo giggled.</p>
