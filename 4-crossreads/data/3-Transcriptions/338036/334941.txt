<p>[25th Aug. contd]<br/>Our section were fortunate &amp; were handy to everything.  After tea I ventured to find a river for a bath but when I found it, it was too dark &amp; cold so I postponed same.  On journey I met Ossy Wood strolling along with some other officers of 9th mg Coy &amp; chatted after things for some time.<br/>Slept cold, very draughty.</p>
<p>Sunday 26th<br/>After parade we were free for the day &amp; took advantage by making a tour of country.  Dick Gates, Davidson, Lyall Walker &amp; self set out per boot "slicked up" etc and passing thro village of Drionville where the 9th mgrs were, we arrived after a pleasant walk at Nesles on the main railway route.  Being Sunday the people were dressed smartly &amp; church was just emptying as we arrived at the village.</p>
<p>This district was occupied by the 19th (Butterfly) English Divn.  Learning that it was impossible to get a train to Desvres we decided to have dinner at Nesles &amp; walk down the valley after.  We had an excellent dinner of fried eggs &amp; chips and the people were very sociable in fact one boy was learning English at St Omer College &amp; could speak well.  Pushing we had rather a stiff climb to top of ridge but was amply rewarded by the view it affords as one can see for miles.</p>
