<p>26.3.17<br/>Dear Dad, I passed this edifice on Sunday. I do not know why it is call the Poultry Cross. I will have to find out from one of the Salisbury People. It is right in the centre of the city not anywhere near a Paddys Market. It is very old &amp; crumbling away in Places.<br/>Best of Love &amp; Wishes  Harry</p>
