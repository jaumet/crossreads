10th. Saw the best football match this afternoon as I have seen for many a long year, it was between the 1st 13th Batts both unbeaten teams, the Brigadeir of the 4th Bde kicked off the game started she was willing right from the start in the first half 3 of the 13th Batts. men were down out, but they soon brought them round, this was a little unusual for the 13th, it has been generally the other way about, the first half was very tame our chaps could not get going at all just before the bell went the 13th scored a try but failed to convert scores were 3 to nil, shortly after the second half started, the 13th scored again, things began to look very black for us the 13th officers men were very cocky began to sling off, but a change came o'er the scene, for all of a sudden our backs got moving some of the prettiest passing running as ever you see resulted in a try for us, amidst a scene of great excitement things began to liven up properly now
