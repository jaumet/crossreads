which I had gained from the seas. Instead, there was a charming Malta, scattered with numerous villages and divided into innumerable little holdings, all under cultivation. Everywhere rose stately spires and domes, dominating the villages, and in fact forming on one the impression, that before one lay the Kingdom of the church and the villages servile to its domination. Away on the distant horizon, looking over the circumjacent lowlands loomed a stately array of spires. The domes and minarets of the Old City - Citta Vecchia . As there is an hourly rail service, we left by a quaint affair made up of four tightly packed 3rd Class Carriages and a 1st. The way to Citta Vecchia lay through well and closely cultivated lands, each little allotment being walled in by stone barricades and growing crops of wheat, barley, onions, potatoes etc.
