  
 March 15 219. Our 6th day ended.  Tonight to the Olympia and another mid-victorian show of bicycle stunts and juggling. 
 To the Notre Dame, through the gardens of the Louvre, to the Parthenon, and to the Eglise St. Etienne-de-Mont, a beautiful building full of Italian influence and design.  Lunch at the Medici Cafe by the Luxembourg and on through the gardens to the Musee. 
 Not 50 yards from the Gallery, alongside a great bronze group of Bacchus and nymphs, on Monday a bomb fell, and the gallery is full of most wounderful bronzes, and encircled by them.  One gallery entirely directed to etchings by Brangwn [Brangwyn] and Rodin statues.  The Age of Bronze, John the Baptist, a Burghers of Calais, and Eve, besides six busts.  One drawing of Beardsley's of Dulais and of Rackham's, a splendid collection of lovely pictures, Conder and a hundred others. 
 March 15 So through St. Germain and to St. Surplice.  There was at about 2 p.m., there was a long explosion in the distance, followed by another and another, a panic started, people fearing bombs, but to us it was more like a great cannonading heard for an instant and lost. 
 In the church I was surrounded by women in black and one fine old matron earnestly asked where the 'bombs' were falling.  I assured her they were not bombs, and believing me she did a deal to prevent a panic. 
 The explosions were at St. Dennis, in the heart of the Munitions factories, and tonight's terrible rumour is of over 3000 being dead by the fire.  At Sacre Coeur one of the doors was thrown from its framework.  Sacre Coeur a fine building, but unappealing.  Heard there a beginning of a service and some rich chanting. 
 Opposite the Louvre this morning discovered
