 where I had dinner and at 2.45 caught the train for Kesh at the Great Northern Station. In Workman Clark s Co yards there were 3 big ships on the slips being built and in the other 1 big ship,  but there may have been many more for I was not in their yards. 
 Friday February 21. 1919 (103) Third day of leave. I reached Kesh at 7.30 last night, and walked down the line about a quarter of a mile to my  Uncle's John Gilmors. I had to change trains at Clones and Bundorn junction. This evening I walked out to Mr. Andrew Muldoons at Drumard and stayed until after 8. o'clock and walked back to Kesh. It was a very dark night. The flax mill was working in Kesh, scutching flax which consists in removing the fibre from the stalk,The machinery was driven by a water wheel. Last year when I was here, the mill was sawing timber but now it has gone back to its old trade. 
 Saturday February 22. 1919   (104) 4th day of leave. It is very dull and cloudy this morning, &amp; look like rain.
