About June 1918.
Dear People
   During some recent activities an Australian brigade was on the right flank of the British front, and therefore in touch with the left flank of the French.  The infantry was in the closest/liaison and this led to fraternization, for both of these fighters have the live-liest appreciation of each other's fighting qualities, and many humorous incidents resulted.
   An Australian Adjutant was heard to declare that after the first experiment he only sent God-Fearing tee-total runners to the French H.Q., any others came back absolutely "stonkered" for the Froggy was very generous with his wine issue.
   From the debris of battle, the French had salved a British Light Trench Mortar, one which fires so rapidly that usually eight shells are visible in the air at once.  It was the delight of the French to "wangle" the Ammunition from the Aiussuies and then get the "Toute Suite Cannon" (as they christened it) into action, exclaiming excitedly as they loaded "Bon for Allemagne" - "Bon for Allemagne!"
   The French gunners were noticed, after a wine issue had been completed and consumed, turning without orders and by common consent to their 75's and without gun drill but with hearty good will, sending rapid salvoes over to their hated foe.
