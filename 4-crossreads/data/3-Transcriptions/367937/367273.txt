<p>B Squadron<br/>1st Regt ALH<br/>22nd August 1916<br/>Dear Boys,<br/>I have not had a letter from you for a long time; don't know whether it is that you have not written or your letters have not come, but I have not heard a word about the car from you and I expected to get pages; if it is that you have have not written My Word! You will have to look out when I get back cos I'm getting very strong over here &amp; even though you two are growing up I'll still be able to wop you. Did you get all the photographs etc that I sent you the first time I get any leave I'll send you some more but I cant post them from out here.<br/>Yesterday the whole of our squadron rode over to the sea for a swim and had the time of our lives; we took all the horses in and used to swim out and then race for the shore; it was perfectly calm and there were no waves and the horses enjoyed it just as much as we did.<br/>A lot of niggers were down there washing their camels and I got some good snaps; some of our chaps got hold of a camel and lead him out into deep water and then used to climb up on his back and dive off him; altogether we had a real good time.<br/>I have been allotted a real good horse, a nice tall one to suit me &ndash; Have not decided what to call her yet but am thinking of calling her "Ta-whealer" &ndash; big one same as the niggers call me only you see so much that is Egyptian here that you would like to get away from their names for a bit.</p>
