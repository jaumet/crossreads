We were to have held our brigade sports today but they were postponed owing to the bad weather. Am sorry to say that a lot of the old faces I knew before are missing now.

Well dear old Sis give my love &amp; kindest regards to all Vol's people, a bundle of kisses for my little niece &amp; fondest love to you &amp; Vol from your brother Hal.</p>
