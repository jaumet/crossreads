<p>June 1915<br/>Tuesday 29<br/>Hot. The heat is making itself felt here just now. It is extremely unpleasant in places where dead bodies of Turks lie within a few yards of our trenches, it being impossible to send burial parties to bury them as it would only mean more <u>death</u>.</p>
<p>Wednesday 30<br/>Cool wind blowing Nothing eventful to record</p>
