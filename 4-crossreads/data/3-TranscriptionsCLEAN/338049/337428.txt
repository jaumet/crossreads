Tuesday 6 AugustWet day - not too auspicious for the big stunt to come off shortly. Preparations marvellous & fast. Quiet evening, but singsong later.
In bed called out to go to [indecipherable] Chateau to maintain line to 11th Bde. (already disc). Left out 11 p.m. arrived 12-30. Road blocked with great traffic including tanks.
