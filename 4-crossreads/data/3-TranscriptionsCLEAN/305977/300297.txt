 Sunday 26th Arrived at Zeitoun about 2 am & had a 2 mile march  We camped in a mess room for the rest of the night.  Had no blankets but felt tired & slept fairly well on one of the mess tables.  There was 95 of our Brigade.  The rest are all split up in different parties.  We got a good breakfast about 9 am & were practically the first to get back from the peninsular.  The camps are much better than they were when we were here last & the quality of the food has likewise improved.  We were well treated at Zeitoun, the cooks turning out & making tea.  We also got a good breakfast & dinner, receiving a plum pudding each.  All the boys have stuck together
