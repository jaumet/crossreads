  
 to manage the Post Office - It is fearfully badly managed. We do not know how long we shall be here, so still address my letters as before. Well, we reached Gordon House about 10.15. p.m. It is a most beautiful building  & had only been seized     2   3 days before from German Spys. It was cleaned  & only had our beds ready for sleeping, not even a chair - so we all had a wash, then went to Heliopolis House Hotel for supper. It is the best place here. Mr. C. said he would follow me but he went to The Palace & could not find out where we were. Glad to get to bed & joy able to stay in bed until 8. a.m. Had to go to another place for our breakfast  & it was funny - A french restaurant  All got so excited at seeing so many Sisters that we did not get out of the place until 10. a.m. Breakfast - 3 eggs fried with tomatoes, potatoes & green peas. bread & butter &  tea. All for 10d in our money.
