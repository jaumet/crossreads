7/2/17  Rouen to AmiensOut and breakfasted by 8.30. the French breakfast of a large cup of coffee with milk and rolls and butter is very sensible. Set out for the Records office going along the Seine River front. The river was covered with ice which was coming down thick. Big steamers berth right alongside the street. Near Rue Jean D'arc is a very high Transportation bridge suspended from which is a cage hanging by steel ropes. Could not examine closely but it seemed as if this "ferry" ran across just above the water. The bridge is a steel structure and very high. Close by here there are enormous stacks of bully beef and biscuit higher than some of the adjoining warehouses. The trams are all electric and run entirely by women who wear a little forage cap. The men here much favour the hood and cape and draw the hood right over the hat making an odd picture. Through by ways to the Records office and there met Colonel Griffiths A.A.G. and went through our Battn records adjusting many little details. He kept me talking on Courts, Casualties &c &c for a long time which was galling as one wanted to do some
