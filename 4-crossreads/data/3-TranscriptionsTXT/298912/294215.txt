scoring board, Here we used to spend many a pleasant hour, It is no use trying to keep out of trouble whilst hanging around the camp. Get away from it as far as possible & run risks - they are well worth it because on an average a soldier only gets punished for one hundredth of his sins.Concerts were given in the Recreation Room at Moore Park & some talented artists gave interesting amusements that broke the monotony of camplife.Out of two months in Moore  Park I only spent three nights in camp & was always out somewhere making a nuisance of myself. Church parades were always held on Sunday morning. The C.of England section left at 10.30am for St. Mathias Church Paddington & returned at 12.45 pm. The Nonconformists left at 10 am & returned at 10.30am - their service being short & sweet & held in the Show Ground.We soon took a tumble & went to the Nonconformist's section & on return
