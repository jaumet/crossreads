[Drawing of Soldier]The Old Platoon
We'll drink a health to the Old PlatoonAnd the men who strode alongIn the frosty light of a winter moonTo the swing of a marching song -
The men who marched to the old front line,To the land of frozen dead,To the shrapnel's burst and the bullet's whineAnd the shell-fire overhead.
We'll drink a health to the men of old,To the friends that once we knew,To the vanished voice, to the heart of gold,To the comrades tried and true.
To the cheerful swing of a marching tune,To the tramp of marching men!Oh, drink a health to the old platoon,For we'll never march again!
Charles Gilmour.
