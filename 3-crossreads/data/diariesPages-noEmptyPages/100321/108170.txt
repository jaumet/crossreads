6/2/19 Gourdinne
An utterly uneventful day but cold as ice. Snow inches deep. Cafe with a cousin of Crochelets returned of Paris. Fat unwashed party tonight in all about 2  tons of Belge.
7/2/19
Sunshiny but bitterly cold. Visited our Printing office and then the Brewery. Too cold to do aught else but hug the fire. After lunch walked to Thy le Chateau and there saw Colonel Courlette C.R.E 2nd Divn had a yarn whisky with him. His men shooting game danger caused my visit. We discussed Italy and other warm places. The wind driving frozen snow in front of it like sand. My hairbrush frozen hard and stiff. Rumoured that we move up to Marcinelle on Wednesday next. The fireside the only place tonight.
