 attacking. The 1st Div, attacked this morning, retook the village of Lagnicourt, we were [roused?] out at 7Am to move forward immediately, the 8th &amp; 14th Bde have already gone forward. We had a hurried breakfast, it is 8.30 now but have not yet moved off, expect to any moment. 10.30 We moved off about 9 Am reached a village about one mile away &amp; received orders to about turn, so we are now once again in our old quarters, waiting for the next alarm. It seems that we retook the village, so there was no occasion for us to move up. The brigade line was cut, else we would not have moved out all. It is raining again &amp; the ground is very slippery, we would have had a hard walk. Bapaume April 16th 17 After all we moved out of Le Barque, left about 5pm we are now billeted in Bapaume. Just at the rear of the town are a few hills, from the top of which, I obtained a very fine view of ruined Bapaume &amp; the surrounding country. We then went and had a look at some German prisoners, there are about 500 here just now. Fritz is sending some shells over occasionally. I think he is trying to get at the station, while on the hill he sent over some duds.
