<p>I spent our last fortnightly holiday with Elsie &amp; as you may guess I had a good time.  I wish the War was over &amp; I was settled down.  It will mean 4 or 5 years chopped right out of a man's life, as it were, &amp; right at the important period of it.  Oh! well, a fellow has a lot to be thankful for- that he has his life at all in these times.<br/>Another crash this evening through the control wire jambing.  The pilot (with his Wings, too) escaped miraculously from a vast heap of splinters, unscathed.<br/>All being well, I am to do my first solo on the service machine before breakfast tomorrow morning.<br/>It is the type of machine I will be flying in France, if ever I reach there, &amp; I hope I don't make a hash of it.  They are very hard buses to land, but I think I am equal to the task, as I have had about 4 hours dual on this particular type.<br/>I will try &amp; get a letter off to Olwen by this mail, but I have some Aerial Nav to do to-night for the morning, &amp; if I am unable to catch the mail give her my love, please Daddy, &amp; tell her I</p>
