 Dear Mrs. Dunlop 
 Just a line to say I am well & happy in wearing your knitted socks. The Autumn is here & soon I think we will get real Winter but as  for  we have had only 2 months of cool weather with a snap of cold in it for the past 10 1/2 months it will be a change. We are engaged in plenty of daily work some of it grim, some pleasant, usual lights & sounds of active warfare one sees almost daily but our men are cheery
