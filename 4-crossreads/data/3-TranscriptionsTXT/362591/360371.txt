 Egypt March 23, 1916 
 Dear Ferg., 
 We are still in Egypt and I in particular am very sore.  Our chance of getting to the front is very remote.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the war fizzled out before we get a chance to see some fighting.  There is no news.  Vick &amp; I are both well and bored stiff with inaction.  For weeks now we have been doing nothing at all, just waiting for something to turn up. 
 Kind regards to all from Vick and Greve, E.C. New
