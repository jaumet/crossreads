<p>Dear Mr. Horsefield &ndash;<br/>I am sending Mrs. O'Brien of whome I spoke to you the other day &ndash;</p>
<p>You may remember she is asking for her fare to Bendigo for a change under the Dr's orders. She is anxious to take advantage of the excursion train on Thursday next. I hope you will be able to help &ndash;</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>B. Booth.</p>
