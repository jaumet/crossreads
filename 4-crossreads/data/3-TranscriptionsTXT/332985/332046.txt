 Fine, but dull.  Enemy celebrating the fall of Bucharest, out on parapets, drunk, our Artillery opened fire on them killing hundreds.  This happened at 10 p.m.  Very quiet last night, and today, as regards shells coming over.  A few singing about, but not near us. 
 14-12-1916 Ten remounts received, making our total of horses up to 99, instead of 119.  Quiet night, a few shells about today.  Some talk of sending 40 horses back to Albert, one shoeing smith to go with them.  Report from Bty.  One shell landed in a dugout, (no one in it) another alongside of gun pit, and numerous time burst.  No casualties.  Capt. Heslop, V.O., To be Major in today's orders. 
 15-12-1916 Showery, not so cold.  The usual shelling last night, no damage.  New Vet. Officer, Capt. Lucas.  I was using some thick heels and toe shoes, he picked one up and said, of course you belt down those, pointing to the thick heels.  Where ignorance is bliss, tis folly to be wise.
