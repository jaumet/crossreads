26-2-16Sat 26thLast night several natives went between the men on the special patrol with donkeys & camels loaded with burcene [lucerne]; they did not know that they had gone through till they saw where they had crossed  their tracks during the night; Johns &           had an argument this afternoon but the Col came on the scene during the first round & stopped the fight.
27-2-16Sun 27thWas on mounted patrol last night but had a very quiet time, a patrol from B Troop managed to catch a couple of Bedouins a few night ago who came in to buy burcene & they are at present in gaol.  5 Lovetts Scouts are attached to us & are to go out on camels with natives scouting a couple of days at the time  received a parcel from Stan tonight.
