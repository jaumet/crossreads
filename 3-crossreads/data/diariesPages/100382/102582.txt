January 1916
place with high white stone buildings several Australian Hospital of which the Palace is the biggest. On Sunday the 23rd I made arrangements with cobbers to go see the Pyramids. We set out about 10 am caught the tram to Ciaro then another tram to the Pyramids. When we reached the tram terminus we paid 2/- each for a ride on a camel as far as the Sphinx. On reaching the Sphinx we had our photos taken on the camels then hired a guide to show us round. First we were shown all the ancient toombs of the old Kings every time we stopped the guide would wont to tell our fortunes but did not succeed. He then handed us over to another guide to show us through the Pyramids.
We had to take off out boot's crawl through a small opening near the bottom then slide down a narrow passage about thirty yards long. On reaching the bottom of this passage we had to climb up another about the same length width. At the top of this passage is a big chamber about sixty feet square about the same in height, It is supposed to be the burial room of the ancient kings there is still a big granite coffin in the chamber. Right underneath this room is another only smaller this is supposed to be the burial place of the Queens. After having a look at this room we came out climbed to the top outside X which is 450ft high was a very strenuous climb.
