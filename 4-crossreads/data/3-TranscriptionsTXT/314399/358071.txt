Saturday 15 March 1919On special duty at the Rouelles station today . Went down to see if the Nirvana was in but it wasn't so we blew out to Bill's cousins place. Had dinner & taught them some more bridge. Got wet through coming home. Didn't have our coats & of course it rained a soon as we got out of the train.
Sunday 16 March 1919Went to Bills cousins & had the usual old sing song. Only saw a little of the sun.
