 Sunday 8 October 1916 Dull with a wintry wind blowing most of the day. During the morning was kept standing by in anticipation of word coming to leave for Army H.Q. &amp; when the message did come the morning was done. After lunch went part of the way up to the line &amp; then had a bath &amp; change before the car came at 6.30. It was a lovely motor ride : the sky was rather overcast, but the moon was almost full &amp; lighted things up fairly well. Ruined Ypres was really weird. The road was crammed with transport of all kinds bringing stuff up to the people in the line, big waggons, limbers, lorries, watercarts, motor cars &amp; motor bikes were intermingled with horsemen, all confusion being saved by the traffic police at the busy points. Lights put out passing thro' one or two towns where are big ammunition dumps, &amp; finally reached Cassel a little before 8. Dinner, &amp; late to bed.
