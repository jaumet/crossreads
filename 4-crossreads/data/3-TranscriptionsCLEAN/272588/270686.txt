  
 Friday 5 April Still wet & prospects of more rain.  A walk round to Remi Siding & a look over the grave yard at the C.C.S's  which grew very much as the result of the Ypres stunts.We move tomorrow &entrain for the Somme where things seems to be livening up for a German attack. 
 Saturday 6 April What luck.  After many days rain to-day is fine for moving.  We marched from Hoograf to Godewaersvelde where we entrained.  The march lay along the base of the Mont des Cats & I was on the wheel stretchers - pack.  Godewaersvelde of course is in France.  At 2 a.m. we are now at Amiens on the Somme & Fritz is about eight-ten miles out towards Albert & St. Quentin.  A journey, via St. Omer, Calais, Boulogne & Abbeville was made in cattle trucks.  Our billets are about 4 kilos out on the Abbeville road. The City of Amiens is full of inhabitants from villages within the new danger zone & they naturally think things are very black. In a big attack last week four uhlans were seen in here & repulsed by Armoured Cars!!  Marvellous how they got through.
