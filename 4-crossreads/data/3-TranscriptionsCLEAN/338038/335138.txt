Don't forget to let me know what Unit he is serving with if you can find out as it is impossible to trace anyone here with the number of their Battalion etc.  Young Frank Turner from Alexandra who came away in the D.A.C. with me is in an Artillery Observation post in the Lone Pine trenches recently carried by us and I see him pretty frequently. Well dear Father & Mother, it is no use wishing that this war would finish, as wishing will not bring the end any nearer, but I am longing for the time when I shall sail up Sydney Harbour again and up to Angledene. Must close now with fondest love to yourselves & Pat, and hoping you are all keeping quite well. I am Your loving Son Terence P.S. Since writing above Mum's letter of 25/7/1915 has reached me. Will answer by next mail. Terence
