<p>2.  train back to Bulford.<br/>Yesterday I went to Salisbury again &amp; spent my time in the usual way.  It was nice &amp; cool &amp; the ride on the Bike was good.  Ellis &amp; I laid Linoleum down on the floor of our Room this morning.  It looks quite nice now.<br/>We are both doing well.  We have had no mail for some Time, but we don't expect many letters now.  Well, Dad, Mum &amp; George, I have   <strike>had</strike>   no news to give You, so as I have all the roll Books to make up &amp; some more letters to answer, I'll have to wind up.  I do not think that the other letters will be looked at to-day.  I have only spent 2 afternoons &amp; nights in this Camp since last Friday week &amp; one night I was on Duty &amp; I'm on again to-night. I may go over to the Isle of Man on Thursday for a couple of Days.<br/>Well, Dear Ones, I must hurry up with my work.  Ellis has gone to Sarum or Salisbury on the Bike.<br/>Best Love &amp; X'mas Wishes to You All<br/>Harry XXX</p>
