<p>when we were all lined up this morning. We had a cabel read out to us from the King &amp;amp: Queen wishing all the troops a Merry Xmas.There were sports held in camp today foot running boxing etc. also football matches. I have been in the tent all afternoon writing.We have been a bit unfortunate are what is called the inlaying Batt for three days so cant leave the camp. It is just in case of any trouble among the troops. They are liable to get over the traces at Xmas. I expect Sydney has been pretty lively last night &amp;amp: tonight. I haven't had any more letters from you or anyone else except Nurse Smithers had one from her the day before xmas. She said she had seen you &amp; that you were looking well. I expect Bert will soon be on his way across now. No word when we are to make a move. May be at a moments notice. Will be very glad when we do get a move on. Am anxious to try my rifle</p>
