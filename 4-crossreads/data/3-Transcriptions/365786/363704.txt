<p><u>The Nile</u><br/>The Nile is the 2nd longest continuous waterway in the world.  From the Ripon Falls at Lake Victoria to the sea it is 3473 miles long &amp; the last water it receives is from the R. Atbara 1900 miles from the sea.<br/><strike>As</strike> Practically no rain falls in Egypt (about &frac12; inch per annum) so as a fertile country it would cease to exist were it not for the Nile.  The height of the inundation is regulated by the rains in Abyssinia &ndash; the river begins to rise in June</p>
