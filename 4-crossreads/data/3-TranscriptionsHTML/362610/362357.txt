<p>Sunday 21 May 1916<br/>A summer's day, the heat being rather trying &amp; the little stream near the camp was very well patronised by hundreds of the men bathing.<br/>Church Parade in the morning was taken by the Presbyterian padre who preached on "Hobab the Midianite"; a very helpful service. Did some writing during the day &amp; in the afternoon went up to the hospital &amp; looked up a few of my old men.<br/>A glorious evening &amp; warm night.</p>
