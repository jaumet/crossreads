 Burt Finlay was also there.  I don't know whether you met him or not.  He came over as a Sargeant under Cassar in the original 17th Battalion, &amp; has now got his commission.  This is his first rest &ndash; if you could call it a rest, for nineteen months.  He has been sent over from France with    seven other officers from the 5th Brigade, into a temporary staff job &ndash; six months &ndash; in the 5th T.B. 
 Talking about weather, we are having the filthiest imaginable.  As cold as a frog in a frozen pool, with mud &amp; slush ankle deep all over the place.  I am writing this in a cold barrack room, crouched over a very warm coke fire, with the writing pad on my knees.  Outside the wind is lashing the rain against the windows &amp; strewing the mud with Autumn leaves.  All the trees are losing their green colour &amp; turning a beautiful reddish brown.  In fact the signs are extremely ominous; &amp; force us to realize that winter &amp; Christmas are fast approaching. 
 Keep smiling so that your Christmas may be happy &amp; your New Year bright.  Give mother &amp; Dorothy a Christmas kiss for me &amp; tell Catherine that I miss her cooking frightfully.  Remember me to Mr. O'Reilly &amp; anyone else that would be interested to know that we are alright this side of the world. 
 Your affectionate son Keith
