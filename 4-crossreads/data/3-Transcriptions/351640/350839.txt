<p>Jack McGlynn [McGlinn] has been for several weeks at the Dardanells.   Wonder what his luck has been?   Hope the best, &amp; that he will get safe home.   No list of the killed in battle has yet been published here.  John Patrick McGlynn was in S. Africa, and did good work.  He is a first class soldier.</p>

<p>The Orsova was timed outwards on the 20th. Wonder did she pass along the Canal a few days ago?  If so she will have letters from me for you.   Please convey my regards to Mgr Weston.   Ask him did he receive my letter written Care of the Orient Coys agents at Suez?   It should have been delivered to him as he was going north.</p>
<p>Today is published in the papers account of the death of General Bridges.   What will you in Australia think of the casualties.   The list must be growing each day.  We see little of the names in print but we hear about such and such officers having been killed.  Some men were telling me tonight, that they saw Colonel Braund in the firing line and that there was no braver officer.  He was rather severe.</p>
