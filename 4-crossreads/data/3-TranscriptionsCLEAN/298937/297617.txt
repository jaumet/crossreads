Friday 7th July
Tonight is one of the nights on which we were supposed to move off, but orders were cancelled.  At present we have no idea when we shall leave but we are to be paid on Tuesday so going on Sunday is knocked on the head.The dispensing is doing well;  growing every day & is more neat & orderly.Broke lense of spectacles last night & am now having a fresh one procured.Have not written at all for over a week, so must really settle down to do some tomorrow.
