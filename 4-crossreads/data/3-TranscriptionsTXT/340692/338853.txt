 That part of the line assigned to our Ambulance (worked in conjunction with two other Units) was devided into stages, or what was known as posts, or stations.  The two far posts were situated within a few hundred yds of the front line, &amp; were known respectivly as Goose Ally on the left, &amp; the Sugar Refinery, or Factory Corner on the right.  These two posts converged to what was known as MacCormacks Dump, with one relay (Mt. Corner) between that &amp; Factory Corner.  From MacCormacks (which was afterwards shifted to Cough drop Ally, owing to having been shelled out of the position) the line ran back through the Crest, Runners Post to the Main Dressing Station, which was the last post that concerned we bearers.
