<p>even though often hard worked<br/>of course we all are inured to Rifle fire &amp; the fall of Bullets &amp; occasionally shell &amp; shrapnell fire too. I must say I most distinctly do <u>not</u> like shrapnell &amp; dive for shelter when I hear it comming. Sniping if we are at long Range is treated by all with Contempt but if our ardent friend is at short Range then one &amp;  all are wary &amp;  so Casualties are avoided by care &amp;  common sense<br/>I trust you &amp; the Dr. are both well. Diarrhoe seems to be the chief complaint if a man is sick, I am glad to say that I have kept well up to the present we have a Dentist here &amp; I have had the novel experience of having a Tooth stopped in the open [with] the Trenches active</p>
<p>Grace will give you my address<br/>Best wishes to you all<br/>G R Short</p>
