<p>get away to the Battalion tomorrow, though noone can tell me where to find them.  I may have to enquire of Fritz if I wander too far &ndash; nobody knows exactly where the line is.</p>
<p>The Chinese labour companies, which are always kept well back from the firing areas, have shown the usual panic; some of them being completely scattered &ndash; the officers in charge could not calm their frenzy or keep them together.  Three big Chinamen wandered into Marie Cappel &ndash; which really is St Marie Cappel - today, one which a bandage round his head.  When a Fritzie 'plane came over and the "archies" started to fire they were scared to death.  The three of them scrambled to "take cover" behind an empty wine cask standing in front of an estaminet; &amp; in their consternation they overturned the cask, which rolled away leaving them sprawling on the ground.</p>
<p>During the afternoon some French armoured cars the crews of which look a fine body of men, were arriving in Cassel.  The night we were leaving Amiens, I am reminded, we saw the Guards arriving.  In spite of the train journey they had just completed they were polished &amp; dustless, &amp; certainly looked fine; although their regard for their "smart" tradition seems ridiculous in the face of the desperate condition of matters.</p>
<p>This goes away with the driver of an A.S.C wagon who is going to hand it on in a C.S.S  to the first man with " blighty" he thinks worth trusting.</p>
