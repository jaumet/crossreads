June 16th9.30 pmAbasan el KabirThere is no doubt that my nerves are not all that they should be. Tonight I am very apprehensive of gas as the wind is just right for it.It is probably very unprobable but I can't get the idea out of my head.Very welcome rumours though unfortunately only rumours, that we, that is, all first contingent men are going to be relieved this summer.The day after tomorrow we go down to the beach so will be packing up tomorrow.
