<p>we left Cape Town.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening when we were passing Robin Island we could plainly see a large steamer that was stranded on the rocks about 2 months ago. Men are busy salvageing her. She was not far from the Shore &amp; was in an upright position. We also saw just outside the breakwater a large timber steamer, heavily laden &amp; with a tremendous list to port. Her deck cargo had apparently slipped.</p>
<p>Sunday July 2. 1916.<br/>It is very cloudy this morning. The course is N.N.West and the speed is 11 &frac12; knots per hour.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening the Gunners fired two shots with the gun at a box in the sea. The distance was 400 yards and they scored a hit. The gun is 4.7 calabre, 2. F. electrically fired.</p>
<p>This morning I went on as Mess Orderly with Roy Partridge &amp; Archie Borthwick. We are on for a week. The usual fire alarm on Sundays</p>
