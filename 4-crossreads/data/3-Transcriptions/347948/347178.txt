<p>Night is gone and day is breaking<br/>Sunbeams gently kiss the dew<br/>Mingling the green with diamonds<br/>Shining in their verdant hue<br/>In the midst there stands a lily<br/>Proudly in its purity<br/>Ah, its virtue, sweet as heaven<br/>Just like you dear, seem to me.</p>
<p>Here comes Carmichael's band<br/>Here comes Carmichael's band<br/>Oh just listen to their merry tune<br/>They've got a ripping lead<br/>And now they only need<br/>A girl or two to appreciate their view<br/>With Sergeant Flynn in front<br/>Im sure you'd have to hunt<br/>For any band that springs to it as well<br/>And if some Friday night<br/>You see a lovely sight<br/>Of 30 couples sitting far away from the light<br/>Bet that it's Carmichael's Band</p>
