 
the number of rumours that are going round as to our new destination, but I fancy it will all end on the Somme again. Some big bets are being made, & excitement prevails. So far it is not known to anyone at all. The Brigades are now out of the trenches & I believe we go to Wipinhoek tomorrow. This is a Rail Head & may mean entraining for any point.

The motor column is now delivering to us from Caestro & it is much easier for our working.

Several flights of aeroplanes crossed today towards the German Lines, evidently on a raid. No doubt we will get their reprisal tomorrow. I hate their aeroplanes to come across as not only do you risk their bombs, but our guns start throwing shells all over the place, & we get the benefit of the falling cases or pieces of steel. I have seen the whole sky one mass of smoke explosions.
