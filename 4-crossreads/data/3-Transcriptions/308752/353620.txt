<p>before we arrived at our destination, &amp; the further we marched back the more cheering our surroundings became. The "Diggers" are billeted in some old brick works near Rossel &amp; it was not very long before all had turned in for a little sleep. At 5 p.m. the 8th Bearers received orders to report back to our Unit which we did arriving there in time for a hot meal. The Unit was living in a gully, in dug-outs &amp; shanties about a mile away from the brick works. Of course we were glad to be home again. Great news to hand that Bulgaria had surrendered unconditionally. I am sure that this is the beginning of the end. Once more I came through another Stunt &amp; my good luck &amp; continual good health again greeted me. The following day news came to hand that the Division that relieved us had a very successful stunt, the prisoners they captured were estimated at 3000, they passed by our camp, to the prisoners cage, which was close at hand.   Many guns were also captured an advance of 8 miles.  This kind of news, is cheering everybody up. Rumours flying round that very shortly we will be moving right away from the straffing. I sincerely hope it is true, as it will be a great relief to get away from this ruined country &amp; be near some civilised town. Visited the Engineers &amp; had a yarn to Willie Paul, he also had some trying experiences in the Line. We drank your health with cocoa, &amp; hoped for our speedy return to our sunny Homeland.</p>
