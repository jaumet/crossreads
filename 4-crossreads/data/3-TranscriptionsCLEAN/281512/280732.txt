  
 16th October. 1917 Tuesday Met Shackleton & he paid up like a man. I might say though, that had I not been over to collect the amount I would have been a poorer & wiser person. Afternoon to Military Headquarters, where I met Colonel Griffiths, Colonel Hurley & Major Gowing.  All give me every assistance in their power.  Evening to Arlette [Musical theatre production] at the Shaftesbury with "Sunshine" which we enjoyed thoroughly. Weather is extremely wintry, it raining without Cessation. 
 17th Octr Running round after a panorama Camera & other materials for winter. Lunched with Philmore & Curtis.   Afternoon on arranging various matters re registration of negatives, Cinema films & exhibition. To bed at 8 pm being dog tired.
