 30.8.15 Mon. 30th.  The Engineers on [indecipherable] fired 3 mines at 8 oclock last night &amp; a warboat fired a few shots at the earthworks at 10 oclock, we could hear the Turks coughing as a result of the fumes from the high explosives used, but the shells did not do much damage to the works as far as we can see this morning.  A message came through last night saying the 10th L.H. had taken a new trench &amp; there was no sign of a counter attack, they are now consolidating their positions.  The signallers that came from the 12th L.H. relieved us to-day &amp; we now have 48 hrs. off &amp; 24 on, there were 7 sigs. that belonged to the 12th with us now, so we should have an easier time from now on, until a few more gets wiped out at any rate.
