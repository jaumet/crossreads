<p>Sunday 9<br/>Wet &amp; miserable.</p>
<p>Monday 10<br/>Beautiful weather</p>
<p>Tuesday 11<br/>Beautiful day. A dinner tonight was very decent.<br/>Rumours are about that we move back to the line at Messines in a couple of days</p>
<p>Thursday 13<br/>Weather is still fine. We perhaps move on Saturday morning to somewhere in the vicinity of Loere but the journey is to be accomplished in stages.</p>
<p>Saturday 15<br/>Move to-day at sunrise to Senleques via Samer for Reserves. A beautiful day &amp; a decent march</p>
