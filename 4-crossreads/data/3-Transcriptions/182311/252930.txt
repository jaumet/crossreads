<p>Dear Peters,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I send you my heartiest congratulations on the award to you of a <u>Bar to the Military Cross</u> in recognition of your very good and gallant service in our operations near Bony on 29th September last.&nbsp; <strong>X</strong> With great dash and determination, you led your company across ground swept by intense artillery and machine gun fire, and &quot;mopped-up&quot; two enemy trenches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, another company was added to your command, and you succeeded in establlishing yourself on the final objective.&nbsp; Through<sub>^</sub><sup>out</sup> you displayed very high qualities of leadership, and by your marked courage and devotion to duty set a splendid example to your men. <strong>X</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With kind regards and good wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(SIGNED)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W.R.BIRDWOOD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; I much regret that it is only now I have received official notification of the Award, otherwise I should have written much earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
