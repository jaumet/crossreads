<p>1919<br/>Jany<br/>The upstairs rooms were used as billets.  In my particular search for treasure I tapped all the furniture for hidden drawers but only found one small copper coin (a rather old one).  The weather was cold &amp; there were several falls of snow.  We had to go down the road to the cookhouse to get our tucker, &amp; several times, in returning, men spilt their food all over them, by slipping on the ice.  A dirty little specimen of about 8 yrs used to bring her little friend of 7 to talk to me.  He name was Charlotte.  Her mother used to do washing for the men &amp; she used to collect it.<br/>The Huns had laid numerous mines around here &ndash; mainly delayed action ones.  At one big centre the Fritzies who had put them there were found out &amp; had to return &amp; unload them.  A railway line ran right next to my billet, but it could not be used as some of the mines were not due to go up until the following March</p>
