Very dear but the traders were honest seemingly.  Toblers cocoa 1/4 lb,1/2; Black & White Whisky 6/- bottle. went up street and found very interesting wild looking Greeks in native costume & pretty little youngsters.  Met 2 English nurses in street and they were as glad to see us as we were to see them.  Talked for a while and learned that they lived up in the Citadel and were working in a new French hospital just established.  Hard faced girls but it was treat to meet them. 
 In a shop further down encountered a naval officer who had been on the "Powerful" and yarned for a few minutes.  Saw large two storied building with French sentries on duty and orderlies running in and out.  Turkish cemetery behind stone wall all overgrown & a donkey feeding among graves.  Nurses said the Turkish quarter was of interest but would be nothing new to us after Egypt. 
 Returned to boat again at 1400 - fare of boatmen 2d return  Set off for Helles and called in at monitor again to drop two men.  Some French soldiers and a marine aboard this trip.  The mountains of Asiaa lovely sight with their snow cloak in the sunlight.  Skipper a canny Scot introduced me to innermost recesses of his cuddy and introduced a bottle of Johnnie Walker.  Reached Helles just in time to see 4 o'clock trawler setting out. Signalled her and she came alongside, we hopped over.  We have had wonderful luck as regards just catching trawlers today being
