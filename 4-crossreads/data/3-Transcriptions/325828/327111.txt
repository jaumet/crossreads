To-day I have had 5 trips altogether, 3 solo flights totalling 2 &frac12; hrs, &amp; 2 dual flights.<br/>My favourite occupation is to take a bus (we always call an aeroplane a "bus,"- "Oh! she is a slow old bus) up that is fitted with a Camera gun.

I was thrown immediately on to the defensive, &amp; for over half an hour a lively "fight" took place.  I twisted &amp; turned my old bus about, until I hardly knew whether "I was on my head or my heels."  It was fine sport &amp; splendid practice, &amp; when a few days later I saw the film that the Scout pilot took, on that occasion, I saw that</p>
