  
 this evening as soon as it gets dark enough having completed our 10 days in the trenches  I am writing this sitting in my dugout having just come off duty & I have a few minutes to myself before tea.  Len & Dave Murray are playing draughts on a cloth handkerchief sent me by Mrs Mitchell, it was a very handy little thing & not a few get a bit of amusement out of it, & while away some slow hours  I don't get much time for it myself though I can't say that I am fond of the game Bridge" is the game I like to play, Len & I as partners take some beating at it too  The guns on the Somme" can be heard very distinctly today, so I expect we are making another big attack down there on that once beautiful but now shell torn & ravaged part of lovely France one can never forget it "La Belle France"
