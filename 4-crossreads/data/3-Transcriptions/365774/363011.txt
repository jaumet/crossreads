<p>it is pretty sore now, the X ray photo was interesting of this wound, you could see the bullet lying quite comfortable against the thighbone.<br/>A clean bullet wound is absolutely nothing at all, it is only when a bone is shattered that trouble arises, or you get hit with an explosive bullet which makes a mess of things especially if it hits a bone.<br/>I was extremely lucky not to get a bone touched, dozens here have broken bones which will never be right again, they all take it as a matter of course &amp; very seldom you hear a groan of pain, it is only when the Doctors get amongst us you hear a murmur.<br/>I am in a crook hospital, our own were filled up before I reached here &amp; it was only the third day of our scrap that I got hit, it shows how many casualties we had on the first days. I wont go into details about the Hospital but it is a shame to put British soldiers in such a place, it is dirty &amp; dirty natives are our orderlies, there is an Englishman</p>
