  
 These hospital trains are extraordinarily long & it is possible to walk right thro from one end to the other.  The wounded are classified while in the train & valuable time is thus saved when they arrive in Cairo.  At Cairo numbers of Red Cross Assistants meet the hospital trains & like the good Samaritans here supply light refreshments & cigarettes etc. for the men while they are waiting for their turn in the Ambulances which take them to the Hospitals.  Now when a man comes back wounded from the Front he seldom has any portion of this world's goods.  Some arrive in bandages covered up with blankets - others have torn dirty bloodstained tunics minus buttons & sleeves - I heard of one man who managed to retain one of his puttees & cap only - but whatever they do bring back goes straight off to the sterilizer
