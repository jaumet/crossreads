July 1915
Thursday 1Strong cool wind blowing. The sun shines warmly and not a cloud is to be seen. It is one of those weary beautiful days where one seems lifted into another world. The waves gently lap, lap against the shore and I lie under a shady tree where the music of the sea gradually wafts one into a peaceful sleep.
Friday 2Dull. Cool wind blowingFor the want of something to write --
