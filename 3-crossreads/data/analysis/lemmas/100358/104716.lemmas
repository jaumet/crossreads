 They re come in ten of thousand , And here 's to their honour today ? Here 's to the Sister Dominion Who is show us the way ! by a South African . " We cant do much ( I own it ) " well after what I have told you , you can see how modest that statement is . " And throw them a trifl from shore " . That remind me - Two girl , evid well to do girl , spent sever hour each day throw orang to the men on board . The last day , when we were not given leav , they threw 4 larg sack of orang to the lad on the main boat deck ! You can get some idea of what exert this meant by glanc at a liner in Circular Quay see how high the deck mention are , but they threw them singl hand . The Adjutant present them with a big box of Chocol each as they went , and we all gave them three cheer . They wait for no compliment , but threw a kiss were gone . My good , some women do their bit . Well to sum Durban up ? we were simpli stun , goldarn hypnotis far dinkum , by their open hand generos . We had a good trip from Durban to Cape town arriv in that Port at about 3.30 or 4 on Wednesday 20th Sept. The welcom here was cooler percept . Not that we look for cheer crowd , but the whole attitud was differ . I put this down to 3 thing . First , the troop at present here when we arriv had not behav too well , second , the resid were not awar of our come , third , there is a rather more mix Dutch popul who no doubt rememb the behaviour dure the Boer War , which is said to have on occas paint Cape town red . The tabl mountain with the two peak each side is veri beauti , and the build in the best part of the citi are better even than Durban , which has a Town Hall ani citi would be proud of . There are no Rickshaw , which are a picturesqu adjunct to Durban , veri strike to a stranger , and the nigger are of a distinct poorer class . But Cape Town is pretti beyond doubt , and we must rememb that , although we were unabl to accept ani hospit , when the peopl heard of our arriv , they offer it to us . But critic as we all are , the A.18 , love all South Africa and hope to be lucki enough to see it again .
