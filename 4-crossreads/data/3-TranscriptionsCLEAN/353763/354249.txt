  
 I looked in at the Bank of New Zealand & asked for Charlie Thomas  -  He was manager here some 7 years back  -  He is in Dunedin now  -  On my return to the ship I examined a stone obelisk - erected to commemorate - the taking over of Fiji  -  Some ship's arrival & the earliest land sales on that particular spot  -  1837 I think was the earliest date but even now it's getting obliterated by the action of sun & rain  = 
 Wednesday Oct 21 - A quiet morning  -  The only diversification was the case of an AB who got 28 days in Suva gaol for abusive language & threatening demeanour  -  The ship's crew was paraded & the judgment & sentence read out before everyone & off he went with an armed guard to the seclusion of a gaol with native Fijian warders to look after him  -  I had to certify to his health which was excellent  -  Navy  -  discipline is also excellent  -  A man gets cautioned & every chance to amend his way but if he don't he gets dished & to some sound  time too  -
