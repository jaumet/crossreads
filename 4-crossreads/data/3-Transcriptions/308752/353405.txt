<p>The colonel made a very fine speech &amp; wished us God Speed &amp; Safe Return.   The cheers for the Bearers was deafening as we made off. The cursed packs soon got heavy &amp; to make matters worse before we had proceeded far it started to snow very heavily. All were glad when we arrived at the Railway Station. The distance was about 3 miles. (As usual I will be unable to state any names of places or units etc. etc.)</p>
<p>Arrived at -------- at 4 p.m. &amp; marched about 3 miles &amp; are billeted in an old factory at R------. After spending two days here we moved off on the 16th &amp; arrived at the Clearing Station at B------. The same spot where we were stationed last November, after having experienced that awful 3 weeks in the mud. It was still the same miserable hold, plenty of mud.  The march was rather severe as it was snowing heavily all day. The country looked beautifully while a grant sight, the snow was 5 inches thick on the ground &amp; at different spells along the road a considerable amount of snowballing took place. The weather was perishing. Stretcher Bearing in this weather will be very nice "I don't think".</p>
