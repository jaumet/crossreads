<p>Mch 1917<br/>27th/31st &ndash; Bdes doing O.P. work &amp; camels rejoined at camp near beach. Stores being landed from trawlers thus relieving congestion. Trawlers here as soon as we were. on 25th or 26th. Fired on by Turk heavy guns on 27th &amp; they came out of range. Never apprec. tea or a wash more than last few days. Good swimming on beach, good surf &amp; fresh water obtainable at few inches depth. Horses get grazing on green fields now &amp; then. Quite a number of sunburnt faces. Turks put a few shells evidently extreme range &amp; tried to find the camp but fell a mile or so short. Mail at Rafa for last several days. Sent for today. Some of regts already having got theirs. Simmy expected back daily. Strachan gone to Imm. Section. Sand carts &amp; bearers smoke bombed &amp; shelled at a couple of times but no casualties at all. Opposing planes seem indifferent to one anothers presence Once ours ascended &amp; chased Taubes.<br/>April 1917<br/>1st &ndash; 6th &ndash; Rly going ahead. Good beach but breakers rather dumpy. Got snaps of boats unloading. Also went for walk to West of Village, "Tiger" "Pincher" "Nutty" Taubes over every day. Occasionally one of ours up high chases him but he can run away from them &amp; does it keep very high. A.A. handicapped to a certain extent by proximity of camp. On AM of 4th supposed two btns of Turks attempted to entrench near ours. Guns got busy &amp; reports say inflicted heavy loss on them, 800, no doubt exaggerated. Weather getting very warm. G. OC of division (Genl Chauvel) inspecting bde. Very ptclar re appearances.<br/>7/13th &ndash; Nothing startling happening. Taubes regularly visit us three times a day. On 12th they dropped 32 bombs on Rafa, getting a few.</p>
