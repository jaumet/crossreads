<p>every farm has its poultry run and the eggs are most plentiful.<br/>The french people round here are most industrious and women and children work in the fields from morning till night. Every available space is cultivated and it is quite a usual sight to see acres of beans and peas, cabbages, potatoes, and sugar beet. In some places the whole country side looks like an immense <strike> chinese </strike> vegetable garden just like those held by chinese at home.<br/> I have never seen such a variety of vegetables grown on such a large scale. The crops they grow in this district are splendid. The heads of the wheat are so heavy that the stalk is not strong enough to support them and they are bent almost to the ground. This season was splendid until just the time for harvesting when the rain came and spoilt everything. It poured down for days and the crops and potatoes &amp;c. rotted in the ground. It seems dreadful to see acres of wheat and oats, splendid crops, all ruined.<br/>The people here inform me that their only hope of making anything now is from their apple crop from which they make cider, and they are afraid that the troops may rifle their orchards.<br/>It is quite a long time since I received any word from home. I think the mail service from Australia must be  very poor now. I have no doubt I will receive a regular budget of letters when they do arrive.<br/>I will write again as soon as possible and I daresay I will then have something to which to reply.<br/>Trusting all at home are well.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene.</p>
