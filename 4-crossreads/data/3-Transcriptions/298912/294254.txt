<p>The barber on board who by the way has been making an enormous profit out of the troops has been selling brand new books to the troops for threepence each. Now these books are marked 15 cents in America &amp; yet they are new. It is unreasonable to expect him to sell, say sixpenny books for 3d. Also I may say that absolutely no red cross stores have been issued. These books only came out after leaving Colombo &amp; when all the reading matter had been read. Before this he swore that he had neither books nor sweets &amp; yet immediately on leaving, he can find some. It may be ok, but taking into consideration the recent way things have been going they many not be ok. Salmon &amp; other articles have been reduced, now that we are nearly there. This is open to comment. Dinner today consisted of stewed rabbit, stewed to bits, Pierce say it tastes</p>
