It failed even to get the man fully exposed to it on the stretcher, but killed the one man <strike>less</strike> most covered against it.  Two of us returning over the Crest on another occasion had a "Cole Box" [Coal Box, (slang) heavy German shell, usually a 5.9, from the black smoke of the shell-burst] burst over our heads, we saw the smoking nose-caps of the shell land at the side of an Infantryman taking off his boots, the lead spattered the mud all around him "Nearly a 'Blighty'" was his only cheerful remark as we passed him.  There has been shells burst directly in our path, &amp; dug hole large enough to bury a horse &amp; cart.</p>
