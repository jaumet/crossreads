  
 When we arrived there we were very tired, as is generally the case after a rout march, and we had to have have a lay down to ease our feet, as I have said the cobbles are very hard on the feet. 
 We were in the best of nick after tea, so we went up to the town which is a fairly big place and which was not very far away from our billits. 
 All around this town were rows of graves sometimes you would run across a whole trench full of Tommy's. 
 Also at this place there is a big tower of a church, which as I learned had been used by the German's as a machine gun position. 
 All around this tower is marked with shrapnel pellets.
