<p>It was bad enough but it was worse this afternoon. We are on Picquet &amp; had just drawn our tea when we were ordered to fall in. Of course we did not fall in imediately but still we husiled &amp; then as usual stood about &amp; were inspected 4 times. Now we have 1&frac12; hours to wait before going out. The Picquet amounted to walking about 1 mile &amp; sitting down untill 9 oclock then home. Forgot to mention had 2 parcels a day or so back one packed by Am &ndash; &amp; one by Fig  Tob &amp; nurishment also a newspaper from Mother</p>
