The style there does not suit me. After a quiet stroll until 8 Pm we started on our return journey, but tried another Road, we followed a Train line along a narrow street walking along the sides on a pathway of ashes &amp; it turned into a wide road although the Traffic there is also Heavy one could walk along in comfort, we kept going for about 1 mile &amp; eventually arrived at a point where the line crosses our line &amp; we turned &amp; followed our line into Camp although it is a little farther but still when the roads are bad it is the best. After getting into Camp we made ourselves a cup of cocoa each &amp; having some of the Ginger Cake left we had a nice supper, &amp; eventually turned into bed. We had only been in bed a few minutes when an alarm was given of Gas, the Hooters &amp; Engine Whistles &amp; Bells ringing soon aroused every body, the alarm is for all hands to be on the alert, that is place our Gas respirators on our chest, opened &amp; ready to put the mask</p>
