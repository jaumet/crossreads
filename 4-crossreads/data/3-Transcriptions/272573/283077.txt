<p>ladies, we were provided at these stops with hot coffee, and this was a perfect God send to us.</p>
<p>April 8th. Saturday</p>
<p>We are now passing through country which is taken up by industry, judging by the fact that so many factories are about.</p>
<p>We arrived at Rouen about seven oclock.</p>
<p>A large number of Scottish troops were waiting at the siding, waiting for the train which is to take them up to the trenches.</p>
<p>After disentraining we were driven in motors to No 6 General Hospital (R.A.M.C.) which is situated amongst many other hospitals a few miles outside of Rouen.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went back to the railway siding to unload our stores.</p>
<p>April 9th. Sun.<br/>Put on Ward duty in No 4 ward. Acute Medical Ward.</p>
<p>Do not care for it much. Working with Sisters does not agree with me at all.</p>
<p>April 10th. Mon.<br/>Had leave and went in to Rouen in the afternoon. Climbed to the top of the high tower made of iron in Rouen Cathedral. This tower is four hundred and fifty feet high and has eight hundred and twelve steps. From this tower one gets a magnificent view of the city and the surrounding country. There was a terrific wind blowing at the time I was climbing the spiral staircase, which made the climbing very difficult. The Cathedral is magnificent inside and has beautiful stained glass windows.</p>
