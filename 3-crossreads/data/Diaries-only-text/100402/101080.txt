Thursday 30 May
Last night Fritz burnt seven balloons about here, three French. Our people attacked this morning succeeded in wresting some posts from the Bosch, but with about sixty casualties. Glorious day again. News from the South shows the Bosch has advanced ten miles captured 15000 prisoners.
Friday 31 May
Nothing of importance on this front. Another 1st Field man lightly wounded this morning.
"Bob" Goldrick mentioned in despatches. News from the Champagne shows Fritz to have Soissons to have advanced about twenty miles almost to the Marne River.
He is truly wonderful wresting from the French the hotly disputed possession of last year of the Chemin des Dames which cost the French such casualties, in a day.
Even Paris is not absolutely safe.
