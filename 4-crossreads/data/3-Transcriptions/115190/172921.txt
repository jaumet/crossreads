<p>We <s>were staying</s> <sup>stay</sup> here all day &amp; when I am relieved, I discover a waterhole about a mile away.&nbsp; I have a beautiful swim &amp; don a clean shirt.&nbsp; On reaching camp again I have a shave - and &ndash; I am myself again, but I wonder when &amp; where I shall have the next wash &amp; shave.&nbsp; We move off again at dusk.&nbsp; Our objective is Tiberius.&nbsp; The 11<sup>th</sup> Regiment have taken Samakh, but have had to fight for it.&nbsp; They have lost 3 officers &amp; some 30 men but the town is ours &amp; the enemy are escaping by motor boat across the sea of Galilee &amp; by motor lorry to Safed.&nbsp; Tiberius has also fallen after some resistance.&nbsp; I learn all this by listening in on the <s>????</s> line</p>
<p>We jog along the dusty road&nbsp; the atmosphere still redolent of decomposed Turk.&nbsp; It is quite dark &amp; I can see nothing through the clouds of dust.&nbsp; About 9 pm we pass</p>
