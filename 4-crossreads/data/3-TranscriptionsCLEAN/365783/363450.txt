hospital stores & comforts, Red cross stores etc   I got moving on the job but had not gone far before I discovered that I was unwittingly treading on the toes of transport officers embarkation officers & medical embarkation officers all of whom appeared to be trying to get through different channels what I reckoned on getting and none of whom appeared to be getting anything.  I was very soon informed that it was none of my pigeon I retired under protest & made out a list of everything I considered necessary & got the interfering cusses to sign a document to the effect that I had asked for the things.   I've now got 'em nailed down & they are beginning to recognize that there's something in Willie.   At first their opposition partook of the nature of a 10 inch steel bulkhead - then it assumed more of the proportions of a brick wall - now it is more of the consistency of Nile mud - soon they will be asking me to have a drink.  I have spent a fiver (own pocket) on urgent telegrams to Hqrs & have as a result of my efforts got things moving a bit.The poor old Count is hopeless - his arm is very bad - he eats well & kept me awake with his snoring till 3.30 AM this morning.I have changed my cabin to-day.
