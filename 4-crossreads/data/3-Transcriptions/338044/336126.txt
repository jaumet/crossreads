<p>2nd Dec:-<br/>New duties in Deaths &amp; Missing branch (temporally) doing typewriting. I manage this rather successfully for the first day but not being experienced typiste, make a few mistakes but Malish. Was paid before leaving hospital yesterday &amp; we have a good time. Bed late &amp;  having secured a mosquito net from Sister Bourke at the hospital to-night, sleep a little better.</p>
<p>3rd Dec:-<br/>Arise late &amp;  arrive at office 9pm. We are very nicely situated here, our quarters being about 5 minutes walk from the base  &amp; the little tramp in the sun about 8-45 am is very enjoyable. Pay another visit to the hospital this evening  &amp; get some letters    <u>Very</u> welcome indeed. Leave me quiet</p>
