Turning a corner at the end of the passage we found another cellar-passage at right angles, & at the end of it caught sight of a German sergeant & 2 other privates : we rushed them & quickly had them with their hands up : the sergt. seemed inclined to attempt to draw his pistol, but my revolver under his nose brought him to his senses.I forgot to say that 2 of the officers were wearing the ribbon of the Iron Cross, & I am very sorry now that I did not "pinch" one of those ribbons as a souvenir : although there was such a host of loot to choose from I finally came away with practically nothing while the Feiss & other glasses were handed over by the Colonel to other officers. However had I been encumbered with loot I should certainly not have been able to move about freely & possibly I might not have come through with a whole skin.
