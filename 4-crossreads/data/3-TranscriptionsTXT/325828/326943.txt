experience of trench-life in Flanders under very unfavourable conditions.It is supposed to be summer here now, but I can tell you that we are very glad of our warm winter clothing & especially so at night when it turns very cold.The wheat crops are well advanced here now and in less than a month harvest will be on us.  The other evening Wal & I were walking back to his "possy."  Time 8.P.M.  Away ahead of us the sun was hardly just ready to disappear behind the clouds on the horizon.  The clouds were like burnished gold.  The fields on either side of us were crowded with wheat crops in ear but still green.  Every now & then the rays of the setting sun caught the ears of wheat & made whole patches of them look as though they were ready for stripping.  On our right two old French laborers were bending over, busy hoeing out weeds & thistles etc.  It was then getting darker as the sun set, & theirthe men were clearly silhouetted.  That picture that Ol has "Angelus" I think it is came into both of our mind's eye & set us thinking of the picture
