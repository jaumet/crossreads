 Strazeel 8/7/16 - Paid the men in the morn and then all hand got busi pack up for our move . Fell in in full march order at 1 p.m. and move off in Brigad column of rout with our transport train in rear . The men all load up with pack and blanket but right throughout the march they stuck it veri well and onli two or three fell out . It was the boast of Nos . 9 12 that none of them had to leav the rank . In the other compani it was veri notic that the "beerhead " fell out . The rout lay through what was easili the prettiest countri we have seen sinc come to Franc . We move along wind road border by green hedgerow or by crop of wave corn . The road twist in a most remark fashion almost doubl back on themselv at time . One minut Bailleul and the observ balloon near there were on our right and then would sudden appear on the left or perhap behind . The long column wound round all these curv and what was perhap a 9 mile march becam veri much longer . We pass through two or three veri neat and trim littl villag and then came into sight of a hill upon the top of which seem to be a convent and a number of tent ? a veri pretti spot . As the march progress mani of the men show sign of fatigu but plod on . The hedg are a veri beauti thing in this countri and are plant along the ditch which border each field and are deep dug. Thick grass grow rank down into the water of the ditch . Between paddock they have no fenc , nor are there ani along the road , the cultiv come right up to the road itself ! There is no wander stock but sometim one see a flock of sheep go along follow the shepherd and his dog . The crook as a rule has an iron curv head as a good piec of wood shape natur in the curv is rare encount . The farmhous look neat and home nestl among tree and crop their old thatch roof often just be visibl abov some fold in the ground .
