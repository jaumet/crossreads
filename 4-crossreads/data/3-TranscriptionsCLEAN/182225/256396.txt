1916   WEDNESDAY 4   OCTOBER
Raining a lot of the day. Out with the signallers all day. Mr Campbell gave us a short lecture on the duties & places of headquarters at night in the office. He said that the patrols were never used now & were only a nuisance, so Lord only knows what I am supposed to be now. Got another letter from Linda 13 Aug.
