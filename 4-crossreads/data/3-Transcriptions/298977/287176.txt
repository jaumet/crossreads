<p>"D" Coy. 19th Batt.<br/>Liverpool (N.S.W.)<br/>Tuesday.</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>Received your letter this afternoon, but sorry to say that I never got Ruby's till Monday afternoon and of course too late to let me know where you would be so I could look out for you.  The Ward must have been a fine sight, but of course, being in it, I did not see too much of it, but the crowd was wonderful.  What struck me most about it was the way the soldiers as a whole behaved, and I think it showed the crowd what a fine mob they are.  Was not a bit tired after it.  Three or four miles was nothing after going twenty a couple of days before, besides there was too much excitement along the route to notice how far I was walking.  I never knew I knew so many people.  As I was on the outside of a four in front of 5th Platoon "D" Coy, I was in a good position to see people.</p>
<p>The rain was rather a pity, but luckily we just escaped it.  We struck a shower or two, but light ones and we were under cover at the Railway when the heaviest came down and reached home dry.</p>
<p>With regard to Kit, we have been issued with the following:-  2 Flannel shirts, 2 singlets, 2 prs underpants, 2 prs socks, 2 towels, 1 comforter, and have other things to come such as a Cardigan Jacket, cholera belt, brush and comb, shaving outfit etc., so you see we are pretty well provided for and don't think I will want you to get me anything else, except more socks, but I can get them when I come down on final leave, which will probably be next week.</p>
<p>Am feeling very fit and well, in fact never better.  The nights are getting very cool now and the morning's at about half past five are nice and chilly.</p>
<p>Might mention that those last socks you made are too big to March in, as they crinkle under the feet.</p>
<p>No more news this time.</p>
<p>Love from<br/>Roy.</p>
