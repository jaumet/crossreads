<p>[21 September 1914]</p>
<p>intended.</p>
<p>We are to go today to destroy the wireless station at Angaur Id about 1280 miles N.W. of here. The wireless is a low power 1&frac12;K. range about 500 miles and owned by the German New Guinea Co. It is really no great source of danger to us.</p>
<p>The convoy duty we were to do is now being carried out by the "Minotaur"  "Melbourne" and a Japanese Ship. The "Melbourne" is to take the ships so far as the coast and then to be joined by the other two.</p>
<p>Yesterday Sunday 20th Sept I went ashore on a foraging effort. I wanted supplies such as eggs fruit etc for the ward room. None were to be obtained at stores in town. I enquired of the adjutant, Provost Marshall, and Quartermaster of the Garrison ashore, about a store managed by Mr Miller, an Australian. His stock was taken over for the army canteen and nothing was being sold, though at any rate he had nothing I wanted.</p>
<p>I then went to "Chinatown" about a mile out of town, and ordered eggs, flour fruit etc. But just now before sailing those do not appear to be forthcoming.</p>
<p>It was comical to find mostly the important houses</p>
