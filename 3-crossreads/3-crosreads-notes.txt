TO DO:

From me:
- Add media (pictures, maps, to the interface
- Check for the url of the audio versions of the transcriptions
- Check more integration with SL-NSW:
	* jquery plugin
	*

notes / suggestions

Authors
a lot of the interesting variations evident in the display correspond with authors. Many of the diaries are in sets belonging to a single author. Suggest you group the rows by author (add a small space between groups) and label each group with author’s name.

Topics
Militar Life -> Military Life
Check correspondence between current topics and labels - sometimes they seem to be a bit “off”
The current topics are quite opaque - hard to interpret. How can you expose more of the character of a topic, and the complex mixture of topics in the texts? I suggest
- add topic-related words on topic focus
- add info on page view showing different topics in that text
- look again at topic groupings - can you usefully identify and add more specific topics?
This is related to…

Characterisation, not Classification
The current interface tends to classify the pages using a “winner takes all” method (according to top topic). This hides a lot of complexity and may be causing confusion with diary text not matching with the nominal topic. I suggest an approach that focuses more on characterising the text rather than classifying it - i.e. showing multiple / complex aspects of the texts, rather than claiming to show what the text truly “is”. I suggest
- instead of one topic per page, topic focus shows a heat map with the weight of each topic per diary page. This would also enable more topics - there’s no great penalty for adding more, if you aren’t showing them all at once, for example you could add food, hospital / injuries, etc.
- this relates also to showing more topic detail at page level, including highlighting topic related terms,  showing distribution of topic weights per page.

Hierarchy
A recent thought… the overall UI faces lots of challenges due to the number of elements and the screen space.
Maybe the top level could show diaries, not pages - e.g. just a bar graph showing length of diary in pages.
You could then visualise the topic weights of each diary as a whole… then focus on a diary to expand it into individual pages? This is a big change to the UI and it also breaks the “path” idea, but if the 12000 elements are too painful this might be a solution.

I think that’s all the main things! Happy hacking…

3-CROSSREADS:


INTERFACE:	

- Final version can be totally-static. It means that code is not building interface upon json data, but using jsn data to flter, browse and so on. Maybe backgroung svg image + transparent svg on top  for all interactions

- Similar cases:
	* 5 Visualizing Lexical Novelty in Literature by Matthew Hurst (2011)
	* 6 On the Origin of Species: The Preservation of Favoured Traces by Ben Fry (2009)
	* 7 Texty, a visualization tool to aid selection of texts from search outputs by Jaume Nualart (2008)
			Texty could be used instead of on-item-per-page
	*! 8 Bible Cross-References by Chris Harrison (2008)

DATA:
	- We are going to use MALLET for topic model analysis
		* Referencies:
			> Topic Modeling Martha Ballard’s Diaryby Cameron Blevins (2010) 
				http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/
			> 
	- Analysis:
		* Topic models by page. Page is the text segment unit
		* Timaline of all cross-diaries topics: evolution of topics from 1914 to 1919
		* 
		
DATA ToDo:
    - Build real data:
DONE      * Define all possible/desirable attributes for diaries metadata
DONE      * Define the method to get each attribute
DONE      * Build a basic data.js with real data
            > To be implemented in data.js:
              >> Define all possible/desirable attributes for pages
              >> TRY diary-page date and location extraction/indexetion
              >> topics with Mallet
              >> locations with entity-recognition per PAGE
              >> GET Diary metadata from State Library NSW
              >> GET authors info: as json?
              
          * Crossreads-data-structure: join pages from each diary (as crossreads-data 1 and 2) page.js
