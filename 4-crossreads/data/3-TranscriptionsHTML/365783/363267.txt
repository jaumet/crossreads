<p>Dearest old Mrs,<br/>My first letter must be to you because you are the first to me. We got away from the Orient Wharf punctually at 4 P.M. &amp; what a send off as we had. I never saw or heard such a demonstration, the boats in the Quay fairly vied with each other in their efforts to make as many toot toots as possible, what a cheering &amp; singing of popular &amp; patriotic songs what a maze of multicoloured streamers. I felt real proud to be one of the recipients of this great send off. But I was glad there were none of my own loved ones there.</p>
