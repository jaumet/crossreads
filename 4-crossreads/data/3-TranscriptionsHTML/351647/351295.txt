<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>It is such ages since I last heard from you that I have been wondering what has happened.  Hope I didn't say anything in any of my letters that offended your Royal Highness.  I had been hoping to have vivid glowing letters telling me all about Singapore and the trip generally.  But so far nary a word &amp; great is the sorrowing in consequence.</p>
<p>I trust that <strike>the</strike> nothing terrible exciting has happened.  Oh well its no use worrying, only I've missed your letters very much, more especially as I haven't had a word from Tog at all for ages.  Miss Hilda wrote &amp; told me you were due back but didn't say how you enjoyed the trip.</p>
<p>How is the Boss &amp; Graham.</p>
<p>I'm afraid my letters lately have been neither frequent nor interesting but there has been very little to write bout bar mud &amp; weather &amp; they are not interesting.</p>
<p>There weren't many stunts &amp; Fritz's little affairs were too regular to be exciting.  Only one</p>
