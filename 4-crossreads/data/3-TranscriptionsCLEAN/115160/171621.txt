Paris on the 6th August
My dear Sir,
I write to you this letter from Paris.  I have come back here for you have perhaps seen in newspapers the class 1920 was about to be called.
I shall go as a soldier probably in October or in September. I pass the revision at the end of this month.
There is a long time ago that I received news of you and I am thorougly surprised
