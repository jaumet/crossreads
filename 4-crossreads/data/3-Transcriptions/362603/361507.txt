<p>4.  Miss Ninnes being responsible for the face washer.  You must thank them both for me.  I would write to both only that my letters may not be liked.  I have not forgotten the other business yet &amp; never will forget either.  I paid the Boatman on the River last Saturday with the last of my sovereigns.  I have had this last one for such a long time &amp; T'was like parting with an old Friend.  I am getting some money from the Firm &amp; when I get it I will let you know &amp; you can pay the Firm in Sydney &pound; 10 for me also for Ellis.  It is much cheaper, no humbug, &amp; quickly done.  I will want some money to go to the Isle of Man this month &amp; I am broke.<br/>Well Dad, I have given You such news as there is &amp; I must get on with some of my other letters.<br/>Heaps of Love to all at Home &amp; to my old Friends who enquire.<br/>Your own Boy<br/>Harry</p>
