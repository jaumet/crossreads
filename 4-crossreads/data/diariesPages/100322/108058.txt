Wiesbaden
Rose at 6.30 a.m. with the intention of catching an 8 a.m. train here and going up to Konigswinter in order to climb the Drachenfels and then going on from there to Cologne later in the day. After dressing a glance out of the window showed light snow and a little rain falling. Had breakfast and then decided to go into Mayence and catch the 9.17 rapide for Cologne. A pleasant walk up from the Pont Principal to the Station. The whole place is laid out in gardens and there is a fine big church which seems to be a Prot. The German policemen wear cloaks and swords and appear a smart military lot of chaps. Arrived in good time at Mainz station and got a good seat in the train. The sun now came out and I regretted not going to Konigswinter as at first intended. Had a good trip
