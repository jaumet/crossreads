<p>September 1915<br/>Wednesday 1<br/>Cool  Wind&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first touch of winter is now on us. One of our transports has been torpedoed with troops on board. She got into Murdross Harbor Lemnos Island safely though. There were very few casualties.</p>
<p>Thursday 2<br/>Cool. We went into Lone Pine again at 12 PM and relieved the 4th Batt. The Turks got a "75" on to our Coy. H.Q. and wounded the telephone operator. I have had to take his place, being a Coy Signaller. I did a four hour watch on this instead of observing during the night.</p>
