<p>on Intelligence work. It gave promise of great interest. There has not yet been a great deal to do. One gets through it quickly when a car is available. I was very interested to hear about Les Whitfeld what about giving one his address in your next letter. I wonder if Keith is in England yet, I am writing on spec and hope to get in touch with him.</p>
<p>Although there is lots doing I have no new to tell you. Please forgive this dull letter</p>
<p>Ever yours affectionately</p>
<p>Walter</p>
