Easy day. Resuscitation lecture and swim in Canal this morning. Sent 2 films by L/C Saddington to be developed. Mail came in today but nothing for me. Sergeant Banner left us today to take up duties at Headquarters as Colonel Roth’s clerk I suppose Private Robertson will take his place as he has been in the orderly room for some time.

Wrote home and another mail in, including one from home. I must try and get a photo of a large boat going through the Canal. We got our ambulance waggon up alright from the Canal with no damage done.

Zealanders Went 12 stone on scales today, about a stone more than when I enlisted
