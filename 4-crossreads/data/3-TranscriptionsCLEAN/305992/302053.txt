  
 & British soldiers. At 8 am we left for the town of Suez for coal & water through the Suez Cannel. The weather being exceedingly hot. Along the banks are the remains of the barbed wire fences, dugouts & trenches, observation posts etc used by the British troops 3 years ago when the Turks came & fought & were badly beaten with a loss of about 7000 dead. As we steam through this Sunday we sighted the camel troops on patrol in batches of 100 men & sentries posted every few miles. Thousands of pounds of light railways tanks etc rotting & of no use just now after the former defence in 1915. Also the crosses on the banks were 8000 Turks were buried. 5 pm We arrived & dropped anchor at Suez. Quite a treat to be away from the submarine zone & safe as far as they are concerned, after 9 continous months running across the Mediterean with troops both ways. 
 16.9.18 The Canberra arrived here from Alexandria. This transport is also going on the same run as us.
