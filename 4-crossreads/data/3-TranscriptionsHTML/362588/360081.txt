<p>No. 111</p>
<p>The Honorable<br/>Mr Justice Ferguson<br/>Judges Chambers<br/>Supreme Court<br/>Sydney<br/>New South Wales<br/>Australia</p>
<p>Just informed mail closes tomorrow and as it is late &amp; am very tired shall leave letter till next mail.  Rumoured today that A.G.F. is at Suez.  If so be here in about 2 days.  This is a bad place.  The sand is dust &amp; the heat has been pretty bad.  The name of this place is Heliopolis &amp; is about 10 miles from Cairo.  We had leave to Cairo yesterday, went to pyramids &amp; had a fine time.  No idea when we move out.  We are very comfortable in big square tents.</p>
<p>Best love to all,<br/>Yours ever<br/>C.R.L. [C.R. Lucas]<br/>20-6-15</p>
