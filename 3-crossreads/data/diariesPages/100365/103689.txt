- 9.8.16 Wednesday -
The bombardment was still very intense this morning they again shelled Senlis, this time managing to land one in a French Cavalry Regiment encamped about of a mile from us. The shell killed 6 men 10 horses. We had one man wounded 3 horses killed today, also 2 waggons blown up.The fighting eased off in the afternoon and at the present time it is very quiet in fact after the turmoil of the past few days, it seems to have a depressing effect on us all, because it is naturally only the calm before the storm. Every gun on the line has 5000 rounds a specially worded letter from General Haig, speaks for volumes. He states that we are no longer fighting for time", but for victory".I received a letter from Owen Dowse who is with Clabby in England he expects to be over shortly.I hope they come to this front but I do not think they will. Today or the next is going to start the most furious long drawn battle of the war, it seems by the comparative stillness that both sides are busy preparing for it.The aeroplanes are very active many duels have been fought. Our Sleeping Lizzie" is preparing to have her share of the forth coming fight her weight of metal will be felt.We have had a rough day of it in preparing Waggon
