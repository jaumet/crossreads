  
 already had their load, and the others were lifting theirs up there.  They were just setting out to carry their burden overland on a track which led straight to the barrage, which had turned us back. 
 I learned more about Australian stretcher-bearers that morning than I had ever known since the first week in Gallipoli.  I cursed my fate that I was not permitted to have a camera there to prove to Australians that these things are true.  As luck would have it, the next time I saw that same scene the British official photographer was beside me.  We saw the smoke of a barrage on the skyline, and, coming straight from it, were two little parties each headed by a flag. 
 We hurried to the place, and there it is on record, in the photograph, for every man to see some day just as we saw it, the little party coming down the open, with the angry shells behind them.  I asked those stretcher-bearers, as I looked up at the shells bursting, how the Germans treated them.  "They don't snipe us so long as we have this flag," one of them said.  "You see, we started it by not firing on theirs when they came out to their wounded.  Of course, we can't help artillery," he added, looking over his shoulder at the place from which he had come, where a line of black shell-bursts was fringing the hill; "that's not meant for us." 
 Load after heavy load, day and night, mile upon mile, in and out of craters, across the open and back again - assuredly the Australian stretcher-bearer has not degenerated since he made his name glorious amongst his fellow soldiers at Gallipoli,  Hear them speak of him. 
 British Head-quarters, France, 28th August, 1916. For a mile the country had been flayed.  The red ribs of it lay open to the sky.  The whole flank of the ridge had been torn open - it lies there, bleeding, gaping open to the callous skies, with scarcely so much as a blade of grass or a thistle to clothe its nakedness - covered with the wreckage of men and of their works, as the relics of a shipwreck cover the uneasy sea. 
 As we dodged over the last undulations of an unused trench, the crest of each crater brought us for an instant into view of something beyond - something green and fresh and brilliant, like new land after a long sea journey.  Then we were out of view of it again for a time, until we came to a point where it seemed good to climb and peep over the low parapet.  It was a peep into paradise.  Before us lay a green country.  There was a rich verdure on the opposite hills.  Beyond them ran a valley filled with the warm haze of summer out of which the round tree-tops stood dark against the still higher hills beyond.  The wheat was ripe upon the far hill slopes.  The sun bathed the lap of the land with his mid-day summer warmth.  Along the crest of the far hills ran the line of tall regular trees, which in this country invariably means a road.  A church spire rose from a tree-clump on a nearer crest.  Some of the foreground was pitted with the ugly red splashes which have become for us in this horrible area the normal feature of the country side.  But beyond it was the green country, spread out like a picture, sleeping under the heat of a summer sun. 
 Pozieres was behind it.  It was the promised land - the country behind the German lines.  The valley about Bapaume, where the Germans have been for two years undisturbed in French territory until our troops for the first time peeped over the ridge the other day at the flashes of the very German guns which were firing at them. 
 Quite close at hand was a wood.  The trees were not more than half-a-mile away, if that.  It was a growing wood, with the green still on the branches, very different from the charred posts and tree stumps which are all that now remain of the gardens and orchards of Pozieres.  I remember, a little over a month ago, when some of us first went up near to Pozieres village, on the
