<p>My dear Judge,<br/>The last letter received from you is dated 29th December from Lawson. You seem to be getting some real enjoyment out of the car. I should think that there is no more enjoyable way of putting in a holiday.</p>
<p>I met Jack Mant (now a full blown S.O) His Battalion was taking over from us in a rest camp &amp; he was sent on as Advanced officer so that I was able to hand him out a lunch. He looks very small &amp; quiet but seems to be fit &amp; happy.</p>
<p>The main topic of conversation in England now is the shortage of rations &amp; the cruelty of the food restrictions. Personally I have been here 2 &frac12; days &amp; have had a good square meal every time so far and I don't think the position is nearly as black as it is painted.</p>
