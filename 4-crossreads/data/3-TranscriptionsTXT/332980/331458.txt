No 2 question & Fighting was to cease at once, the same rumor was in Calais & Boulogne, but in Friday's Paper the Allies were still waiting for the replies, Saturday's Paper brought the news that the Allies meet & agree, Turkey and Austria Force Germany's Hands, and that Austria & Turkey have intimated their Acceptance of Mr Wilson's Terms & are seeking to force Germany to do the same. If Germany refuses, they will take separate action on their own account. I was off duty Saturday Oct 12th I finished duty at 6.15 Pm & stopped in Camp & at 10 Pm turned in & at 2 am News arrived that Germany's answer was in the affirmitive to the 3 questions. The News came from all directions at the same time, it caused quite a stir in the Hut where I sleep, there was quite a chatter for an hour but in some Huts it was kept up longer. On rising this morning Sunday 13th all hands seem to be in a good mood & the News genuine
