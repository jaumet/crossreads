<p>11 February, 1916<br/>Drill as usual to day - quite an easy sort of day, longs smokes &ndash; Its funny to see the niggers come along as soon as we dismount for a spell selling chocolates &amp; oranges &ndash; My mare wont give me a minutes peace when Ive got hold of an orange. Lost my shaving gear out of the tent &amp; its all sorts of a blanky blanky. I had to get shaved by a Gyppo to night &amp; he brought blood in more than one place.</p>
