 Wednesday 19 February 1919 Rushed around in the morning. Met Marie after lunch &amp; we went to Westminster Abbey &amp; Cathedral. Gee it is great. Beats the frog churches easily. Went out to Janet's hospital for dinner &amp; had a gay old time. Janet &amp; I broke a glass as I was drinking. It cut her finger &amp; my lip. Not very serious tho. as usual it rained all day.
