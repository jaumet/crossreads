We reached the road in safety, to discover that Fritz was paying it very marked attention and we scrambled along with our noses almost touching the ground. We arrived at No.2 post without mishap and told Serg. Roberts what we thought of things. For 3 weeks we had been in the trenches, 8 of us and things were normal, and tonight when we are likely to be wanted, 4 of us are brought away. We stayed at the Post until things quietned down and as there seemed nothing doing we returned to our Dugout in the trenches. We went up to the Art look-out where we got a good view of the Bombardment Fritz sent over hundred of "Munnies and made a mess of our parapets in place but only managed to wound 3 of our chaps. One in the face, another in the arm and the 3rd got hit in 5 places but none of them were badly hurt. Snowy, Bert Hunt Co carried them in.
Friday 13th
There were 2 raiding parties went over one from our Brig. and the other from 27 N.F. Ours was very successful they got into the German 2nd Line got 3 prisoners and a new pattern machine gun and got away again with very few casualties. The N.F's were lucky they got over and were returning with one prisoner when Fritz machine guns caught ?em and they suffered heavily. We are expecting to be relieved at any minute, but its 9 o'clock now and no signs of anyone coming, so we'll go to bed.
Saturday 14th
Got up at 8.30, had breakfast and waited for our relief. One poor N.F. got shot clean through the head by a sniper and our party carried him in to the Mortuary. We called in at No.2 post and found the cars waiting for our gear. So we went back to our dug-outs picked up our belongings and brought them back to the cars. Then we went into H. Maudie was there so we informed him that we were all broke, and to our surprise
