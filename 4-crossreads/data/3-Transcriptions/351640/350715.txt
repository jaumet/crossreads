<p>at the cost of 10d per word.  Your money was well expended if you measure it by the pleasure that it afforded to me and the mental satisfaction that it conveyed.  Many thanks again for all.</p>
<p>Now to reply.</p>
<p>Joe dear:/  The delay in receipt of letters is made up for by the budget to hand today.  I am very well indeed, gradually getting into good working order again.  I hope that our Kitty had a turn in the country.  Good Tabby to win the tennis tournament, she did not inform me that she had been victorious.  They must have been a jolly crowd at Cramond.</p>
<p>Poor old Buddie's pen is stilled by the Lenten time, before the forty days had ended, she would have a volume in my letters awaiting her, mainly because, until lent had almost ended, no idea entered my head about her not being given opportunity to read them.  However it may be that she will during the holiday time of Easter week have a few minutes daily which can be given to the words penned here by an old man, who claims to be a particular friend to her.<br/>I shall look forward to the coming of "The Sun" and other newspapers.  Glad to know that you thought my article in the Medical Gazette to be up to the correct standard.  Thank you for the favourable criticism.  To the Herald, may hap if a suitable train of thought comes into my mind.  You write "Dr Lawkins wanted to take it".  Not having been informed as to what room is vacant I wonder which is empty.  Bruck &amp; Thomson were the correct people to consult on the subject.  Right to send the draft to James Thin.  Should I be in Edinburgh I shall call upon the firm, with them I have done business for thirty-five years.  Glad that you spoke with Mr Finney, he will help you at all times.  Your calculation of the distance between Alexandria and Cairo was about correct &ndash; 140 miles &ndash;.</p>
<p>You are great girls to manage the money so well, if you can keep on as you have begun, why when I get back</p>
