<p>1918<br/>27 Aug<br/>where was one of the vilest smelly dead Huns I have ever seen. He must have been dead about a week. We gave him a wide berth. Just after this we came up to Sgt Mjr McKinnon, Bill and Capt Zander. We had advanced a kilo and were right on the edge of Foucancourt village. Fritz had had a whiz bang gun in the main street, but had nicked away with it. (He didn't get far). We took possession of a trench to the right of the village and the company spread itself round. made a possie. As it was impossible, owing to the heavy shelling to keep signal communication going, we became runners, replacing the two that had been killed. After nightfall we were reinforced by some of the Royal Scots. I had the job of leading them round to their position. I was given instructions about the location, but the officer did not tell me about one turn in the trenches, and I consequently place them in the same trench that Fritz was</p>
