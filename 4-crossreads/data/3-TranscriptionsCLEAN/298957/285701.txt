  
 Saturday 17th June Arrived Alexandria at about 7 a.m., disentraining at the wharf. Fooling about the wharf till mid-day having the roll called over and over again until long after the infantry had embarked. At midday we boarded the S.S. Transylvania a 16,000 ton boat of 24 knots carrying the 5th Divisional Headquarters including Mjr-Gen McKay. This ship has been three times chased by submarines and she saved the survivors of the Southland when that ship was torpedoed off Gallipoli.
