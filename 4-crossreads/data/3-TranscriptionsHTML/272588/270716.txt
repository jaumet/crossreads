<p>Sunday 2 June<br/>News from the South shows us that the Boshe has reached the Marne &amp; extended to the N.W. his attack to Noyon. We go up to-night in expectation of this projected attack.<br/>12 midnight.  We are up at R.A.P. waiting for the silence to be broken by our barrage.  No shelling at all to-night. <strike>&amp; things seem to be a bit</strike>Heavy casualties are expected. Two more 1st Field men have been wounded, Bremmel &amp; Gannon.</p>
<p>Monday 3 June<br/>A wonderful success is the only term fit for this morning's stunt.  We were up the line &amp; at 1 a.m. the barrage fell beautifully on to the Bosche line.  All objectives were carried well to time &amp; the result is that we now hold Mont de Merris &amp; took prisoners over 300, ten trench mortars, fifteen machine guns &amp; rumour hath it one field gun.  Our casualties were wonderfully light, about one fifty including forty Germans going through Borre.  Everyone concerned was highly pleased. Practically no shelling by Fritz &amp; no counter attack. Glorious day. The 10th &amp; 11th Battns. were the attacking force, part only of 10th. The fact of the great number of prisoners is due to Fritz changing over when the attack started. The 29th Division on our right also did very well.</p>
