25/10/17 Calais
cold wind. Spent the morning up till noon here and then caught the Paris train getting good seats by tipping MPs. Had lunch in the dining car, served up well and quickly and spent the rest of the day mostly drowsing. The weather still bad and made the scenery uninteresting. Reached Paris at 9 p.m. and took taxi to Hotel Continental and got a room. Our old friend the hall porter was rather well oiled and confined his attention to giving particulars about the lack of hot water for baths c and had less to say about the dangers of Paris.

Did not wake up until 9 am could not get a hot bath owing to the present restrictions. Went down and got a hot shave and hair cut instead. Met Rodda Stewart Kohn ? the former slept out last night!. Went the rounds of the Consulates c for my passport. Used a taxi all the time and
