<p>Dear Dad<br/>A mate and myself have decided to try our fortune with a few tickets in Tatts.</p>
<p>We just happen to feel lucky and are going to give &pound;1 a chance.  Will you please secure 4 tickets in your own name, and keep them for us, sending me the numbers and later the results.  We can <strike>olyn</strike> only raise a bare sov. at present so if you will add the few extra shillings (duty I believe).  You will be entitled to split with us any profits that may accrue (quite a sound propisition eh?).</p>
<p>Your affect. Son,<br/>George</p>
