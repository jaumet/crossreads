<p>not seem very long, &amp; one can hardly realise that a year has flown by. Most of that time has been spent in France, for we are here over 6 months, about 4 months was spent in England &amp; a little over 7 weeks on the water coming over. During this past year I have seen a lot of the world, have been under fire, have had some good times, and also suffered a lot of hardships.<br/>When I left Victoria I thought the war would be over by now, in fact when I left England I thought it would be near a finish now, but I fully believe it will go on right through this Summer &amp; finish about the end of it or perhaps in the Autumn. I will be lucky to get home in time for christmas.<br/>There was a lot of heavy bombardment last night &amp; again today. This afternoon it increased to great intensity, clouds of smoke rising, and a continual roar.<br/>After tea one of our planes had a fight with one of Fritz's or fell in his fires, with a wing broken, turning over &amp; over as it fell.<br/>There were 12 of our observation baloons up this evening &amp; 5 of Fritz's.</p>
