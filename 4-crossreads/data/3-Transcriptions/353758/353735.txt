<p>fire a good deal in daytime and it goes on merrily all night on both sides.</p>
<p>29/4/15<br/>Still in same trenches &ndash; enemy's schrapnel still going strong and the sheels [shells] from our ship and artillery belwo [below] whiz close over our heads on the top of the hill on its way to the Turks position beyond &ndash; some of it comes uncomfortably close &ndash; got relieved about seven p.m. and went down the hill about 100 yards below for a sleep having had only a few doses [dozes] in the trenches since we landed &ndash; find our Company has lost a good many killed and wounded since we went into this position &ndash;  made dug-outs for ourselves and went off to sleep but were called to arms twice during the night as it was thought the Turks were advancing down the head of the valley just opposite our position.</p>
<p>30/4/15<br/>Got up at daylight and went down the valley and made a dixie of tea (first since we landed) and had breakfast &ndash; returned to our trenches in the firing line about six thirty a.m. &ndash; find Turks had dug some more trenches during the night on the crest of the hill on the right about four hundred yards in front of us and sixty yards from our chaps trenches on the other side up the valley (Quinis Post) [Quinn's Post] &ndash; heard while below that Willie Coleman had been shot dead in our trench and of others of our crowd wounded &ndash; later in the day machine guns playing on our trench and had to lie very low &ndash; Crowley and Badman with me in trench.</p>
<p>30/5/15 [Should be 30/4/15]<br/>Turkish machine gun on us again and kept us low in trench &ndash; day deeper &ndash; continuous rifle fire most nights and intermittant rifle fire in day time every day.</p>
<p>2/5/15<br/>We came out of our trenches about 7.30 p.m. all hands having first given the enemy a terrific fussilade [fusilade] of rife fire for about twenty minutes &ndash; another battalion taking our places &ndash; we went up gully quietly (orders no one to fire if avoidable) &ndash; to attack Turks in trench in front of the trenches we had just come out of. Someone ahead took [the] wrong turning and instead of one platoon coming out (it was pretty dark) where they should, [where they should (it was pretty dark)] a part of it (which I was with) got lost and ran into a hale [hail] of bullets &ndash;</p>
