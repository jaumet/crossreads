every few minutes C’main Jack Woods amongst them, also "Pretty" Morrison. Required all the fortitude you have inspired to keep me & help by example to calm others. We #12 platoon took Rifles & Bandoliers & marched (or ran rather) to Gordon Dump for rations. Here news awaited us. The 1st Div. to be relieved that very night. This was confirmed & we slept around "C" Coy’s Cooker all night. Good feed

4.25 a.m. awaked by noise or something. I stole away back to when Charlie & I had been burried. I was after my diary & Charlie’s Haversack. After risking it I was doomed to disappointment.
