a scandal. The day was a fine sunny one and very quiet on this sector. Drew up all the plans for a raid and submitted the proposal to Bde. H.Q. for approval. Arranged the making of "nutcrackers"- loaded waddies designed to crush through a head from skull to lip. After lunch set out on a tour of the position with Stafford. Called on King, Groves and Swanton and then to 21st H.Q. around to Treux and home after around seeing Frenyer Paterson. Very quiet and peaceful today. A few big shells sailing over lazily going well back. Aircraft active. A few balloons up. Aeroplanes were humming over after dark our guns opened up heavily on counterpreparation work. Busy reading writing and doing routine work until late in the evening.
