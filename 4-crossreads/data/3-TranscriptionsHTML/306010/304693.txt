<p>out-door pursuits have had to be considerably curtailed and I am determined to devote mort time to the study of French so that by the beginning of next summer, I may be fairly proficient. At the same time I am studying the customs &amp; habits of the people themselves and their fair country with its fertility &amp;  resources.<br/>Wed. 1st Nov 1916 2 pm.:<br/>While at Paris I missed seeing  a Taube that flew over Wimereux &amp; Bolougne on Monday week. The various anti-aircraft batteries in the neighbour-hood opened a great salvo of fire on the machine which however escaped. The Taube dropped no bombs and must have only been a scout.</p>
