<p>Jan 28<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrived at Etaples 9.A.M. where I got out had a wash &amp; brush up &amp; breakfast &amp; walked up &amp; saw Marion at the Hospital &amp; as she was on duty she asked me to come back at 2.P.M. - I went to Paris Plage &amp; met the sister of one of the boys of the section, as he asked me to look her up if I would be near where she was. I took her to dinner at Paris Plage &amp; was sorry I have to say good bye so soon, but she had to get back to her place of duty &amp; I had to go back to my sister. I met her &amp; a friend of hers &amp; the three of us went for a walk to a small village about five kilo&#39;s away &amp; we had tea at a farm house (the village was Stella Plage) then we walked back to Paris Plage to the restaurant&nbsp;<s>wh</s>&nbsp;we had visited the last time I had seen my sister &amp; we had a good supper &amp; walked home with them &amp; back to Etaples. by that time I was dog tired, having had no sleep much in the train &amp; walking all day, &amp; I tried to find a hotel or room to sleep but could&#39;nt get in any place . at last&nbsp;<s>I</s>&nbsp;in desperation I went to the Y.M.C.A officers rest &amp; got a bed for the night which I was very pleased to get into -</p>
