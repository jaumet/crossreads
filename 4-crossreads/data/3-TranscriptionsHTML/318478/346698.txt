<p>One afternoon I varied the programme by doing a sketch of the <strike>the</strike> little gully called Rest Gully where the Fifth Field Ambulance from Sydney &amp; commanded by Dr. Roth was camped during the occupation.  With the horse &amp; mule in the foreground it made a decent sketch.  Another variation was a sketch of the Valley where we are camped &amp; this though small was successful.  Our Valley "Kara George" or "Black George" is dull but interesting as a problem in monotonous colour.  One evening I wandered into other valleys back of this, the country resembles moorland in Yorkshire or South England, <strike>som</strike> not unlike the bare stuff around Frensham Ponds.  I startled a fine hare but no chance with a revolver with the close scrubby bushes.  As the sun went down my friends the Jackals began their requiem accompanied by the yapping of wild dogs &amp; wolves, quite cheery.  Home James says I &amp; on the way back I had the good luck to see quite a big wolf-like creature, but almost out of revolver range.  He lost a little hair however and I'm sure has returned by the shortest route to Constantinople.  Continued under different tones.</p>
