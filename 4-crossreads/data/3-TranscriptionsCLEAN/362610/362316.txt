  
 Monday 10 April 1916 A beautifully clear fine day. Company parade in the morning & was then detailed to go with another officer & 60 men to a spot 3 1/2 mls. away to act as advance party clearing ground & pitching tents for the new isolation camp. The other officer did not come along at the time & I had to take the party out with only a plan to guide me. It afterwards turned out that this sketch was entirely wrong, so the mistake that occurred was not my fault. We marched on along the road indicated but failed to find the spot, & had recourse to asking where it was, being quite confidently directed further on, but when at 5 o'clock we landed at the machine gun camp at Camieres, I got the commandant to ring up Etaples & was told that the camp was not to be moved at all & to return. Half way back I was met by the Orderly Officer & directed to a totally different spot to that shown on my sketch. Hot tea was ready, & then there was just time to put up a few tents temporarily for the night before darkness fell. It was a cold spot between the railway line & the coast, just opposite to Paris Plage.
