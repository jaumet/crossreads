<p>Well Dear Teen it is not all milk &amp; Honey over here and yet one cannot grumble. Will you ever forget '16 in the mud where I first run up against you. She is a Tres Bon Guerre now compared to what we suffered then. I am in a different part of the line now not many miles from where I met you but all the same you have never been down this far. By the papers you can guess where we are. We had a big victory over the Hun last week. I was in reserves when the stunt opened &amp; my word she was good to see. Inside an hour the Huns were coming back prisoners in Hundreds. Our Boys have the wind up the Hun completely. Dear Hal our Infantry boys are looked up to by all as the finest boys</p>
