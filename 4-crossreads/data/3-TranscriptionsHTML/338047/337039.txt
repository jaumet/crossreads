This belief however, is all tommy rot, as this particular bird had not been at all (so Mr Campbell informed us).  I saw Mrs McKenzie later.  She had recovered her case at Bobbies where she left it.  In the afternoon I went out to see Harold &amp; Nance.  We went to Hyde Park to hear the Band.</p>
<p>May 26<br/>May 26 went through South Kensington Natural History Museum &amp; saw snakes &amp; things.  In the afternoon the YM guide took us around the Temple, Temple Church Law Courts &amp; the old Curiosity shop of Dickens fame.  He also pointed out the lawyers house in "Bleak House".  At night went to "The Boy" at a theatre in the Str&amp;.</p>
<p>May 27<br/>May 27  I went to Horseferry Road in the morning to get a warrant to enable me to go to Hastings on my pass.  I also got some more tobacco there to carry on</p>
