Khamsin again & to show what this means - some Palms are now covered up to their FRONDS [see image for drawing] with Sand - where before they were on the flat - as I said before it is like the hummocks of Warrnambool.
Expect to go to Cairo tomorrow, am quite excited about it.
[The following sentence crossed through]In case my other notes miss you, will tell you again, you can address me as MAJOR from 2/2/17.
The WIND exposes many odd things on an old Battle field - this evening I picked up a Bayonet, some cartridges, 2 full TINS of Bully beef some Picket Ropes etc. etc. like finding Black fellows skin on the Sandhills after a dust storm.
