This month passes with another anniversary of our wedding day dear Bee;
I hope to be home before the next.
All of you must have a merry xmas
I'll make mine as merry as I can for the childrens sake
Their photos are always in my pocket
I received those snap shots you sent dear mother
And by the way I had a fine letter from Bert enclosing several splendid photos, have not replied yet, but must.
Have no reply from Norman since I wrote from England
Would like to hear from him very much somehow
Hope Tom finds good job in Vic
Kind wishes for all
Geoff
Have a large number of post cards to send you when I can
