<p><u>April Fools Day</u> Got hold of some straw last night &amp; made a decent bed although we slept a little cold. Turned out fairly early and went for a sprint down to the village  Heavy frost but felt tip top after my run. Just like August in Aust, &amp; reminds me of the long past winter mornings when Mont &amp; I used to go for a long walk over the hills of dear old Tamworth. Only tea <u>&amp; tea</u> for brek. Trains rush past every few minutes &ndash; passenger, military, red-cross &amp; goods, &amp; some of them travel too, as most of the lines are built for speed &amp; being wide gauge (5ft) the rocking is barely noticeable. There are a great number of Nord Engines with big driving wheels. Have noticed a few hares &amp; rabbits but not many birds (too cold yet)</p>
