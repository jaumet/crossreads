<p>September 1918.<br/>Sunday 15</p>
<p>In Reserve. Hebecourt<br/>Weather glorious. A beautiful spring day. Fritz planes across during the morning. Rumor, we are moving again tomorrow.<br/>Played 53rd football &ndash; lost.<br/>Heard that Tom Main (wounded at Barleaux) had died of wounds  - correct.<br/>Very sorry to hear of this &ndash; he was one of the very best. <br/>Received letter from pal Doug was simply delighted to get it. Seems ages since his previous one arrived. Issue of a chest comforter.</p>
