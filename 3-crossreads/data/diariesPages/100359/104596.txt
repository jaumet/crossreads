Thursday 17th
Wet Day. Wrote to France Bricky went into Sailly to received his medal from the GO.C. The only bloomin? hero our ambulance possesses, yet he had to walk out in the pouring rain. Another busy day for S.P. building new incinerator, etc. "Nugget" tried by courtmartial, but no sentence was passed, and poor Nugget is still in suspense. Nothing much doing.
Friday 18th
Something rotten in the state of Denmark" we were issued with one apple per man today. Last night we went into an estaminet to drink Bricky's health, on getting his decoration. A big crowd of N.Zealanders were passing at the time, and Bricky took out his beer and gave it to one of ?em. In a few minutes the whole crowd who had been in the estaminet were outside with jugs of beer, handing it to the New Zealanders as they went by. They had just come from the trenches near Armentieres, and they appreciated a drink very much. Brilliant idea of "Bricky's". Remnants of Tommies coming from the Somme. They have plenty of trophies, in the shape of German Helmets, Belts, etc. 
Sunday 20th
Church Parade at Y.M.C.A. Johany Moore played his violin, Adamson the piano and the singing was a treat to listen to Cosier preached the sermon and the service was most enjoyable throughout. After dinner Stan Wright, Dodson and I went through the cemetery. Part of it is handed over to the Military for the men who die in the hospitals. Cols and Sergeants and private are all buried alike with just a plain wooden cross to each, with the name stamped on aluminium and tacked on. They are all well looked after, and most of them have flowers growing on them. All the chaps who were wounded in our "strife" at Fromelles and died in Hospital are buried there and they are quite a big number. Finished my letter to D.O.L.
