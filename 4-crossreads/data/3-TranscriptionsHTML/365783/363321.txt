<p><u>Later</u>  <u>26.12.14</u>.   We arrived at Colombo 6 PM this evening we are not to go ashore till tomorrow.   Will probably be going up to Kandy.   Was delighted to get a batch of letters at 10 this evening, amongst them five from your own dearself including those addressed to Melbourne Adelaide &amp; Fremantle.   I was pleased to hear that there was no cause for the scare that worried you &ndash; I was a bit nonplussed how to advise you in the matter &ndash; but your next letter telling me that all was well was a great relief.  If you get <strike>troubled</strike> worried like that again while I am away you had better see a doctor.   Poor old Mrs. &ndash; 'magination of course.   Thanks very much for the letter telling me all about the garden.  I was delighted to hear that you were all so well.   I also had letters from Alfred Davidson, Mother, Aunt Sara, Cassie, Frank, Mr. Gillespie &amp; Mr Slade.   The latter wrote a very nice letter but I can't forget the way Mrs Slade spoke to me when I went to say good bye to them.<br/>W.H.R.<br/><u>Later 29.12.14</u>   Leaving Colombo to-day.  I sent you following cable on arrival here "Well.   Cable Colombo your movements" but have had no reply &ndash; so am chancing that you are on the Demosthenes.   Had grand time at Kandy.   W.H.R.</p>
