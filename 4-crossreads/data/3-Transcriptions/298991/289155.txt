<p>Thursday April 5th<br/>Up pretty early as we left the hospital at 7 am. Rather a cold misty morning, but got warmer towards the middle of the day. Conveyed to the hospital ship in Boulonge Harbour by motor car. Went on the boat about 8 am &amp; left Boulonge at 10 am. Had some dinner (stew &amp; bread) on the boat coming over, &amp; it was very acceptable too. Sea was very smooth. Escorted by a destroyer all the way.</p>
<p>Arrived at Dover about 11 am. French time is an hour earlier than the English. They haven't got the daylight saving system in over here yet. We came over in the Hospital ship "Princess Elizabeth". Entrained (hospital train) at Dover for Norwich, a place in Norfolk. It took us about five hours in the train, never-the-less it was very comfortable travelling &amp; tea given us coming along. We went right up to London from Dover &amp; then came on here. I quite enjoyed the journey. Everybody along the line gave us a very good reception. Upon arrival at Norwich, motor cars were waiting to take us to the Norfolk War Hospital, about 3 miles distant. I came with another chap in a private car, it was a lovely spin out.</p>
<p>This is a very large hospital. I am in U Ward. There are only nurses employed here bar for the heavy work. Convalescent patients give a hand too. It is a treat to get between the sheets again. It was a lovely day as from the time we arrived in England, absolutely the warmest we have had so far this summer. Couldn't sleep very well tonight although very tired, anyhow I was glad to get to bed. There were no stretcher cases on our train. All walking.</p>
