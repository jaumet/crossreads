Alan and I made a tour of the ruins of Bapaume.   We first visited the Cemetery.   It has a great collection of fine family vaults, with suitable monuments.   The work on these is wonderfully neat and very artistic in general design.   Some of the brass work especially attracted our attention.
Of course Fritz occupied the place for some time and buried his dead here too, and, not content with the usual wooden signs, he has erected a fine stone monument to the memory of his fallen heroes, inscribed fully with German characters & dated 1914-15.   It is, roughly, 14 feet in height & represents a good deal of work of no mean standard.    Needless to say, Australian & British soldiers have considered that they too had an equal right with Fritz to inscribe their names here
