19-12-16at Aden on the 4th January so I put in an application from the 3rd till the 10th & will meet her at Port Suez if possible. This afternoon Lindsell & I took a trip over to B.H.Q. & it is rumored there that we all go on next Thursday, so we hope to have any scrapping we may have for El Arish before Xmas day. All gear we cannot carry on horses goes back to Mazar tomorrow & only a spare shirt & pair of socks are allowed each man; I have managed to bring the 4 Sig. Panniers along to here but will send them back tomorrow as they are unnecessary; Two Taubes caught our men napping this morning coming over at sunrise dropped a load of bombs each & then made back, have taken the 'phone till 12 oclock tonight to write letters.
