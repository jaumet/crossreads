 14th Feb 1916 My dear Father, 
 Having sent all the company out road making & trench digging, & having fathomed the mysteries of acquittance rolls & pay books, which I mentioned in a note yesterday, I appear to have a day of illness before me. The only thing that is likely to disturb my leisure is a call for some return or other. How many men in your company are short of identification discs? How many serviceable gas helmets have you in the company? Are there any men who are badly in need of boots? Report on the state of the rifles on your charge. Send in recommendations
