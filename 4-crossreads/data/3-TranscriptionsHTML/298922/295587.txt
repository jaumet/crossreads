<p>Wednesday 3rd October 1917</p>
<p>TARANTO<br/><strike>Still flying "Yellow Flag" &ndash; one will be like ENOCH ARDEN ere England is reached.</strike></p>
<p>Alongside an ITALIAN Battleship is practising with her big guns &ndash; shaking us from stem to stern &ndash; a dirigible Balloon spotting for the guns, flies overhead. This is a wonderful harbour the opening no more than a street wide with many storied houses built to waters edge, &amp; the shipping is hidden by the Houses. The days drag on &amp; I'm very hungry to get on our journey. <strike>Post this ITALY.</strike></p>
