  
 Monday 31 December 1917 The last day of this so far most adventurous year of my quiet life.  May the next see peace in this sad old world is my prayer! On duty 'till 5 p.m. & had some good talks to interesting pts. - one, Ward, described the river Amazon, fastest current of any river, 5 knots per hour, narrow as "Connaught" ward in places yet a 12,000 ton boat may get up, has seen a cargo of 5000 tons Brazilian nuts shipped away from the port.  Chief exports are coffee, rubber, & nuts. At 5.18 p.m. motored to Mena House with S. Watson & McCain, then under the shadow of the old Pyramids with a lovely little wind blowing had our palms read, then dinner & so home.  Fortune in my face &  very good , wherever I go, good, marry in 7 months, going further on in 9 days, 4 days trip, etc.  Back at 27th G.H. 8 p.m. & so closes 1917.  May '18 bring Peace.
