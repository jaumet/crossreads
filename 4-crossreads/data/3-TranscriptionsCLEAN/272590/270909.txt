Signals - Gilbert Frankau
The hot wax drips from the flaresOn the scrawled pink forms that litterThe bench where he sits:  the glitterOf stars is framed by the sandbags atop of the dugout stairsAnd the lagging watch hands creepAnd his cloaked mates murmur in sleep -Forms he can wake with a dick -And he hears as he plays with the pressel switch, the strapped receiver click,On his ear that listens, listens,And the candle-flicker glistensOn the rounded brass of the switchboard, where the red wires cluster thick.
Wires from the earth, from the air;Wires that whisper and chatterAt night when the trench-rats patterAnd nibble among the rations, and scatter back to their lair;Wires that are never at rest,For the linesmen tap them and test,And ever they tremble with tone.
