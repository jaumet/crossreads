<p>The New Year has passed off very quietly not withstanding the fact that it is <u>the</u> festive season of the year with the French as much as Christmas is with us. Everyone in the north of France is feeling the effects of the war too much for gaiety. The weather is fairly wet and cold and strong winds are very prevalent; it is not often that we see the sun. No snow has fallen since before Christmas.</p>
<p>Jan 11th to 12st  My leave to United Kingdom</p>
<p>Left camp at 3.30 am on 11th inst. (Thurs) and travelled to London via Boulogne, Calais. &amp; Folkstone. I caught a train at Victoria Station to Wallington in Surrey, about 13 miles from London, arriving about 9.30 pm at my destination. Stayed with friends that night and caught train next morning to London. Saw the changing of the Horse Guard at Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, Bank of Eng. Mansion House, Fishmonger's Hall etc. etc. en route to A.I.F. Headquarters where I had to report.</p>
