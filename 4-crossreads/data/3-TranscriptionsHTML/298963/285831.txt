<p>4th April<br/>Continued with duty of day before.  In afternoon explored an old French stronghold.  It runs for great distances in several directions &amp; was very strongly protected &amp; fortified.  Some 40 ft. under ground a suite of cement rooms were built, presumedly for the staff, a little way further on were the mens quarters.  All round the hill are still to be seen the cemented loopholes, where the machine guns were fixed.</p>
<p>Later went on tour over the old battle front of Somme &amp; Ancre.  The scene of devastation &amp; havoc is complete in every sense of the words.  It would be hard to step 2 paces, where great shells have not torn up the ground &ndash; rifle bullets &amp; machine guns &amp; smaller shells have left no trace, unexploded shells lie about in plenty, owing to the muddy ground, failing to give the required amt. of percussion,</p>
