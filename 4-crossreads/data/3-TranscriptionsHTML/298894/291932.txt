<p>at the gangway, a nerve racking game with a rough sea and officers of all ranks are going &amp; coming looking for mails or orders or news of current events.   We have just had news of the first death from wounds in our unit, a young fellow named Abbot &amp; strange to say his number was 13.   Each evening now, reinforcements are sent to the Dardanelles by means of fast channel boats.   The Submarines have made it too risky to allow of Transports going unless specially guarded.   They receive a good send off from their fellows.   There is some little alarm amongst us this evening as rumours are about that we quit the ship.   This morning a huge red cross was painted on the side &amp; in the afternoon orders were received to paint it out again.   We wonder what it fortells.   As I was writing this on the deck in company with a few others we received one of the numerous pinpricks passed out to us occasionally.   We number 36 all told, no other troops, &amp; the Colonel came up &amp; ordered the W.O. to send us below as the 3rd Class deck was good enough.    Again, we were first allotted bunks now we are shifted to new quarters with no sleeping accomodation except the deck &amp; one small room in which to jumble our kits, rather unnecessary severity when we are only a small medical Unit alone on a big ship.   We fully expect our tucker to be reduced when the officers find out how the ship is feeding us.</p>
