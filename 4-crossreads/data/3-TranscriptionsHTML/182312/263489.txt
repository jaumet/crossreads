<p>trades, and what is better still they can work with a minimum of</p>
<p>tools which, perhaps, is just as well otherwise the work would</p>
<p>never be done.&nbsp; Rough carpenters, sheet iron workers, tylers etc.</p>
<p>turned to with a will and within four days we had the village</p>
<p>looking trim and capable of giving shelter of sorts to two</p>
<p>Battalions of men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy has destroyed all wells before leaving</p>
<p>either by blowing them in, by poisoning, of by filling them up</p>
<p>with stable refuse, so it became necessary to provide our own water</p>
<p>supply.&nbsp; Well sinkers were found in the ranks and even divining</p>
<p>rod experts were forthcoming.&nbsp; These latter possessed a special</p>
<p>facination and before long everybody from the Colonel to the cooks</p>
<p>was running round with bits of forked stick.&nbsp; As a matter of fact</p>
<p>it was obvious that water could be found anywhere in that district</p>
<p>but nevertheless the divining rod experts claimed a win when the</p>
<p>spots they chose yielded water at 7 or 8 feet, and the Battalion</p>
<p>marvelled at their prowess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All sunken roads, quaries, reserve trenches etc.</p>
<p>in this district were honeycombed with large dugouts so it was</p>
<p>evident that here were the enemy&#39;s main camps (if you can call</p>
<p>series of dugouts,camps)&nbsp; from which he worked the areas over which</p>
<p>he had recently come.&nbsp; Surface camps he never used, all his men</p>
<p>being kept underground.&nbsp; Most of his dugouts had been destroyed</p>
<p>by blowing in before he left, but here and there were found fine</p>
<p>commodious underground structures which had either escaped his</p>
<p>notice or in which the charges inserted had failed to explode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this district had been the scene of under</p>
<p>fighting in the olden days, in fact this is said to be the tenth</p>
<p>time that Bapaume has been beseiged but never of course had it</p>
