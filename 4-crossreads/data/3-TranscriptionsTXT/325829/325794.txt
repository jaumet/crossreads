On the night of the 5th [June 1918] The Regt left Ain Duk for Solomon's Pools arriving a Talaat-ed-Dumm the next morning. It was an excessively hot day, with dust storms in fact in fact one of the hottest days experienced East of Jordan, we marched for Solomon's Pools the same day & the night was very hot until the column reached Bethany when a change was experienced, & when Jerusalem was reached a bitter cold wind was blowing. The Bgde halted between Bethany & Jerusalem for a while to let the 1st Bgde through. The Regt reached the new bivouac area early in the morning after travelling all night  men & horses were very tired, this was one of the most sever rides (except Amman) the Regt has undertaken, owing to the sudden change of temperature from the excessive heat of the Jordan valley to the bitter cold winds of the Jerusalem hills. The change in the temperature also brought on Malaria, which the men had contracted in the Jordan valley (vide [see] RMO's report attached). The Regt bivouaced here until the 21st of the month [June]. The usual duties were detailed daily, as in a standing camp, including learning in bayonet fighting etc. Parties in charge of an officer left daily for Jerusalem & Bethlehem sightseeing. The climate was rather cold, but invigorating & the men certainly benefitted by the change, although really they had hardly time to get acclimatised. Plenty of fresh eggs, vegetables, & fruit could be obtained from the villagers round about
