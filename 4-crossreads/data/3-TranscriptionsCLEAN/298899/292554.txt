 7th November Being called at 6 we breakfasted at 7 & caught the Metro tube at the Palais Royale station to Pont Maillot, that being the station at the Boi de Boulogne. We then engaged an open taxi & entered the Bois by the Allee de Longchamp. The driver was determined to show us the place very thoroughly for he twisted & turned in all directions, passing lakes, cascades beyond number, the Hippodrome de Longchamp, Polo & Lawn Tennis grounds, the garden Zoologique de Acclimatation, the leading race course of Paris & various buildings. The place was at most deserted the weather being cold & inclined to rain but the woods with there autumn tints had a beauty all their own. A number of deer were seen just before we left by the Avenue du Birs de Boulogne, a beautiful avenue which led to the Arc de Triomphe d'Voile built at a cost of 360,000.
