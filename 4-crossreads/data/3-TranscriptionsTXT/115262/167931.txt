 Sea a lot calmer this morning and we will soon be in the Gulf of Aden. 
 Two boats&nbsp;&ndash; 1 tramp &amp; 1 liner passed us going in direction of Colombo at 6.30 a.m. 2 sharks 12 feet long following boat with a dozen or so smaller ones. Several whales seen some distance away at 9 a.m. One came up on surface &amp; was plainly seen. All were spouting. Flying fish were being chased by (&quot;Beeneta&quot;)&nbsp; (Dolfins) &nbsp;fish [Bonita]. These (Beeneta)&nbsp; (Dolfins) &nbsp;are as long as 5 feet and of a bluish green color. They can swim very fast. 
 At 6.30 pm a large shoal of porpoises was seen close to boat.&nbsp; In early hours of tomorrow morning we pass Aden. &nbsp;2 boxing contests this afternoon. Heat very great &amp; atmosphere moist &amp; very oppressive.
