  
 The battalion has been out for a rest since I was wounded but I expect are in it again by now, It is good occasionally to see someone over on leave to get the news, not so much of the fighting but of how one's friends are getting on. 
 I saw Mr Wade when in London, he says he is better than he was when he left Sydney but not too well, he asked me to lunch but I was unable to accept : I hope you are well. 
 Schofield is also in this camp, sick of it but can't get away: a battalion is like a home and apart from the time spent on leave there is no fun in being away from it. 
 Kindest regards, Yours very sincerely Alroy M Cohen
