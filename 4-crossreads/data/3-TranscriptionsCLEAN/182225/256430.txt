 Raining & blowing & very cold. Revielle at 4 pm & we moved off at 6.30 & took up a position about 3 miles away & supported our battallion (33 rd ). The waggon lines were at the stables here, so we all came back with the teams & then had to take the first line waggons out. We finished up about 4 pm after a good day. I was on stable picket at night
