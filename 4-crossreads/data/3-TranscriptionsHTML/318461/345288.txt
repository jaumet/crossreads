<p>Bugles sounded lights out when there was a rush in the air &amp; Bang about 20 yds behind my Tent. One of fritzs Bombs from a Taube. Got 5 wounded one of them being one of my mates a Bugler there were 3 of us in the Tent at the time &amp; what a scatter it was laughable to see them going for their lives away from the Tents however he only dropped one more &amp; that about 400 yds away.<br/>Had it landed amongst the Tents a lot would have gone out as the charge seemed to open out on the ground like a fan &amp; would have caught you even if you were lying down.<br/>The Sergeants had a narrow escape 10 of them were standing up in their mess &amp; the Tarpauline was riddled. A lot of Taubes were up &amp; the guns were blazing at them. I hear they got one at Bapaume.</p>
