1916   MONDAY 25   DEC.
Fine part of the day & raining for a few hours. Mother & Struan & Self spent a very quiet Xmas in the Abbey Hotel only going for a short walk in the morning Alan did not come down but went up to London. I got back to camp about 9 pm in evening The boys who stayed in camp had a very fair time. What a difference from last Xmas spent at 4D with only Linda & I & Jo & Father there. It was a nice warm day I remmember, & Linda & Self went for a walk up the Strand scrub uin cool of the evening. I wonder what next Xmas will bring. Home; I hope.
