<p>had had to be discontinued at noon, but we recommenced at about 6 p.m., and did not stop till 4.30 a.m., Wednesday morning.  The first case taken was a German whose right leg had been almost severed just above the ankle.  The German Surgeon, assisted by Dr. Ollerhead, with Dr. Todd as anaesthetist, amputated the leg successfully in the middle third.  The case did very well.</p>
<p>We now gave our attention to our own wounded and after dinner started on "A".  This boy had over thirteen separate shell wounds, most of them very severe.  They involved the right thigh, buttock, leg, and foot, both bones were fractured 2 inches above the ankle and, in addition there was a large area blown out of his left groin, exposing the femoral vessels and spermatic cord.  It looked at first as though we would have to amputate, but we decided to give him a chance, and after cleaning up the wound with soap &amp; water, hydrogen-peroxide, and iodine, and removing the metal accessible, iodoform grains were inserted and the leg was put up in a back &amp; side splints.  It took Dr. Ollerhead &amp; myself, working hard 2 solid hours to complete the case.  Dr. Todd gave the anaesthetic, which the patient stood very well.  This poor fellow had been in considerable pain.  He was now put in charge of a special nurse in the Commander's Cabin.  All future dressings had to be done under anaesthesia for about fourteen days, but the latest report is that the leg has been saved.</p>
<p>After doing the operation mentioned above, the German Surgeon became more of a hindrance than a help.  During the evening he broke 4 of our syringes without successfully giving an injection,</p>
