<p>the morning things being very quiet indeed.  During the day we were subdivided, 34 men being sent on a little further to run another bath house.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12th July<br/>A very quiet day only admitted 6 or 7 patients.  Owing to orders coming to shift on once more had to pack up the dispensary again and hand over to B. section which arrived during the afternoon to relieve us.  We were rather wrath as we had fixed things up beautifully.  Sampled the divisional baths during the morning &amp; altho' I did not go through the whole regime only having the hot bath I will give the full circus.  The men march in at one door, undress, affixing their identification discs to their tunics &amp; pants which are handed over to girls who run a hot iron all over the seams etc to destroy the livestock.  They then pass in to the bath room which contains a number of half-barrels filled with hot water in which they splash to their hearts content.  After this they hand in their underclothing getting in exchange clean ones thus being turned out absolutely free from lice.  The dirty clothes are then taken over by girls who first soak them in disinfectant &amp; wash them thoroughly</p>
