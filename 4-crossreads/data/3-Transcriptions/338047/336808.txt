<p>1918<br/>Sept. 3<br/>All ours too. it was enough to turn a man off his dinner. I climbed up onto a roof and pulled off some iron, and we fixed up a little house that Fritz had left in a trench. He had only taken the roof off it. As this movement was going on all the morning men carrying big sheets of iron, old doors etc from Halle to our possie, Fritz, who had a balloon up overlooking the whole thing suddenly decided to shell us. He put it in good and heavy, mostly 5.9"s. our joint escaped, but Lieut Murdoch and Lieut Rush of our Company together with their batman while trying to get down the trench to a safer place were all killed. About 4pm he started shelling again, a little further off. We were all sitting down in the possie. I looked out to see what he was up to and got a mouthful of vile gas. I retched immediately before I was able to get my gas mask on. I got it on and warned the others. The Company orderly corporal came running down</p>
