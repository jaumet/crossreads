<p>had to wait till eleven before we could truck the horses, all aboard arrived Serapeum early in a.m. found one man shout swornered[?] he fell out of the train. I rode back for him, found him horribly cut about, and nearly killed with shock, dressed him and stimulated him, took him to hospital in a special train.</p>
<p>Thursday 27th</p>
<p>Could not cross the canal so it took me four hours to finally get him to hospital. I think I absolutely saved his life, then I set out to follow the others, my poor mare had no breakfast or drink in a blazing sun, finally arrived at a big [indecipherable] called rail head where the lights along terminals. There I found my A.M.C. men with the stores.</p>
<p>The regt had moved on three miles over a rough desert to a place called Gebel Hebertd[?] where they relieved the 9th L.H., all the 3rd L.H. Bde went from railhead to Bulna, I stopped at R-lead until the camels were loaded then saddled and rode my precious little mare to our camp, both of us were nearly done up when we reported to the Doc, it was the first I had seen of him since we left Kantara, after I had a cup of tea the camels arrived and I unloaded them and literally fell down along side fast asleep.</p>
