<p>from Matron Bell to go out to dinner &amp;  she has been awfully good to me.<br/>I told you Mr. C. has gone to Alexandria to the Post Office so I'm missing him very much. He has been jolly good to me. Had dinner with him several times. Afternoon teas &amp; he took me around Cairo showing me the shops &amp; where to buy. One afternoon Sister Weisse &amp; I had fun, trotting around the native bazaar with him trying to buy a few necessary things. Hope I get some pay this week am getting a little low in funds. Have  &pound;5 of English money but do not want to part with it. We do not know how long we shall be here. Still address 1st Aust. Gen. Hosp.  Charlie had young Cuthbertson to see him, just as I was leaving. <br/>Had a glorious time last Tuesday. Sister Martin &amp; I were taken by two officers to the "Continental" Cairo, to dinner, then they got a Guide &amp; we were taken to see part of native quarters. A Music Hall &amp; the funniest show I have ever seen. Most awful noises on stone, bits of tin, bones     <br/></p>
