1915Aug. 26 Thu.Every evening after tea I go for a walk somewhere, usually on the Island & round about Kasr-el-Nil.Sunday afternoons I have been spending either with a visit to the Armenian Scouts, Church & Esbekieh Gardens - or trotting round with Ben Champion & Art. Felton as a kind of amateur guide.
