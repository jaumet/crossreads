6/8/17 Campagne
Up early in order to be photographed with the band but owing to fog it had to be postponed. Dr Bunning left for Paris. Owing to baths we did not march out until fairly late and then took over the area of the 24th. Did a couple of tactical exercises by companies on a peaty hillside much like the Highlands ? a splendid view from here. In the far distance the towers of Aire could be seen through the haze. Nearer the farmers were gathering in their crop stooking the sheaves in neat rows ? a fine peaceful sight. Marched back with band playing and then with all officers went down to a conference at Wardrecques where General Paton presided. Rode down ? horse rather fresh. The reaping here is done by sickles and the rain having beaten down the corn they have little hooks for raking it up so the sickle blade can be brought into use. Women and children assist. The latter follow our band everywhere the same.
