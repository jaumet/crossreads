1916   FRIDAY 16   JUNE
A fine warm day. The HMS "Kent" steamed up first at sunrise & the band on the "Marathon" played the National Anthem. It looked all right, the 4 transports lying round the warship & Table Mountain for a background. We weighed anchor about 11 AM and the "Kent" leading we steamed off two abreast the "Benalla" & "Beltana" in front half a mile apart and the "Argyallshire" and "Marathon" a mile behind them. We are to keep that order I believe. I got a cable from Father today "Had good rains Love" and a note from the company to say that there was a cable waiting for me at the Post Office, Linda's I suppose. The fools ought to have had enough sense to send
