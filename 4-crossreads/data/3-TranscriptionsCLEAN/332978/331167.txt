  
 88 November 13th Very cold this mng - quite foggy I showed Stones how to make a meat Pudding today, it was an excellent success & met with the approval of the entire mess - 
 Played Bridge & chess - several officers, having a good knowledge of German, have undertaken to write out English French & German Communiques - These are posted in the Billiard room. 
 Todays Comm revealed some good news. The English are making rapid progress in the vicinity of Paschendale & are also successfully driving a wedge in, along the Ypern-Menin Rd with a view to surrounding Lille in the hope that the Bosche will evacuate this most important industrial town - 
 Also we are now in posession of Dixmude & are trying  to drive  construct a huge salient their & thereby compel the Bosche to retire to Ostend, & then by our naval bombardent, compel him to evacuate that most important city, then we will have a fair slice of Belgium - 
  Altho  Italys losses are now 250,000 this certainly pleases the German people, but the Italian or Russian fronts are not to be the Deciding factors of this war. The western front is the front the Germans want to establish success - This they cannot do. It is only a matter of time & we will drive the Bosche right back to the Rhine. This the Bosche realises. 
 The whole of the Turkish army is in full retreat we rapidly advancing there - hope to take Jerusalem - Boys 15 to 17 are now being called up in Germany
