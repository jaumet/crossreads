In the evening we went to the concert ("Verey Lights") which is still in progress, with a change of programme every night.<br/>31st   Yesterday &amp; to-day we were again on the trenches near Biefuillers.   The other two sections (No 1 &amp; 2) came with us to-day &amp; considerable progress has been made.   No 3 section is on another trench about a mile away.   (Biefuillers is about 3 Km from here)<br/>The good weather still continues, although we has a short but heavy shower yesterday afternoon.</p>
