"D" Camp Mametz
1/4/17
in full swing and a fine thing it has proved. German privates salute by flick of head toward me. Spent the afternoon over the fire with a French dictionary and returned to it after tea. "A" Coy moved to our old camp once more to give us more room. Pay was dealt out after tea. Elmiger reported back and was posted to "B" Co. Ella Comsha sent a pretty little letter full of quaintness.
2/4/17
Idle morning owing to all men being at the Baths. Interviewed some NCOs after lunch ? we have just received our first batch of NSW reinforcements. At 4 pm rode down to Becourt to hear General Gellibrand lecture on various topics affecting the Brigade. It commenced to snow heavily on the way and when we came out there were several inches on the ground. All the huts were clothed in white and Becourt Wood (which shells have spared) looked very pretty. The whole aspect of the landscape changes when snow falls and even on made roads it is hard to find the way. It is infinitely more so out "in front" round the battle line and we thank our stars we are not there tonight.
