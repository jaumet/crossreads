"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, and, thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies &ndash; then Yes.  I'm certain I hear the drone of the enemy again, and I'm sure he is high up and directly above us.  We are waiting breathlessly for him to pass on from over our heads &ndash; when bang went the first gun, and immediately followed the most Terrific Crashes and explosions &ndash; The earth shook so &ndash; the things rattled down from the walls.  We were [indecipherable] to Sister under the bed &ndash; I thought our numbers were up &ndash; that a few seconds more and we would be facing Eternity.  Poor Mary she is trembling so and saying "Oh God &ndash; dear God "isn't this awful Anne"  It was awful.  Short sharpe and loud, then quietness.  The guns had stopped firing.  And we hear our own Aeroplanes going up &ndash; New tactics to-night though we &ndash; so they were &ndash; for they fight in the air &ndash; but we kept in our dug-outs.  Matron is very plucky &ndash; she goes around to see that</p>
