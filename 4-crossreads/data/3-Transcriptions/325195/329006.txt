<p>15.11.15<br/>break in  the line, going, I was halted about every 10 yds by sentries,  but the word linesman asted as well as a pass word as they knew I was out; The night was dark &amp; I had some queer experiences; The line crossed the firing line trench in several places &amp; at times I was out in front of the firing line &amp; sometimes behind it &amp; one place I went to drop into the trench to cross over, &amp; thought the trench was about 4ft deep, but<br/>I happened to be looking a few feet higher up than where I dropped in with the result that I had about 6 ft to drop &amp; my foot just grazed the step &amp; I went sliding down the steps but got off with nothing more than a shaking up, a few minutes after this a bullet hit right under my foot, 3 inches higher and it would have been worth a holiday to me; after this I was out of our own lines &amp; was covering the ground held by the 26th</p>
