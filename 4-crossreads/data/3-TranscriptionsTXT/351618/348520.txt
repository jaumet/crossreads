Being a gunner and then spending a period as a quartermaster, Sparkes is not involved in frontline action. Nevertheless while there are few dramatic incidences, it is an interesting account of the day to day life and the trials encountered - from artillery shells overhead to snipers while swimming in the sea.  Sparkes describes the physical and mental conditions on Gallipoli and seems astute in some of his observations e.g. a certain officer under strain (and he never criticizes those who leave Gallipoli because of stress), the mess of the campaign, a comparison between the Egyptians and the Aborigines and remarkably the probability of Anzac Cove being a tourist destination.  He was mentioned in Despatches but does not explain the circumstances.]
