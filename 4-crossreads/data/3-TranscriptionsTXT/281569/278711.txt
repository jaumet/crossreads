Heavy Bombardment
103 wks of soldering
Revielle at 1.15 & off at 2.
Everything went OK right through the turnout & we arrived at Katia at 0530 & drove them out successfully on to the heights, our guns which had then come out bombarded his emplacements to some order, but their anti-aircraft guns are some class they shelled our planes all over the ship but never hit one although they must have gone pretty close later one of theirs came along & met ors & after a severe scrap ours downed him he fell behind their lines, they shot the pilot dead & the machine turned turtle & the observer was killed also.
We withdrew at dusk after carrying out the job most successfully, & after wandering about in the desert for 2 hours we eventually got in OK.
