 Mon. May 28 (cont)  Lizzie was washing when I arrived.  What a great old yarn we had about old times.  I stayed &amp; had Dinner, Rabbit Pie, which was very nice indeed.  Got punctured &amp; a chap next door, very kindly repaired it for me.  After Dinner I went on to Stone.  Lizzie gave me a big bunch of Lilacs to put on Father's Grave.  The Cemetery was looking very nice, plenty of flowers &amp; the green grass [lush?]  &amp; neat.  Father's grave I found quite easily.  It looks well &amp; evidently receives regular attention.  Went on to Stone.  Called in &amp; had a yarn with Annie Shardlow.  She told me some great yarns about Father.  Went to Unicorn Hotel.  Had tea there.  Then I went down to Ern Harveys, but he was out.  Called in "Black Horse".  Saw Mr &amp; Mrs Bloom.  Mr B is getting quite an old man.  Met Ernest Jackson &amp; Polly Warren.  Stopped &amp; had a great old yarn. Slept at Polly Warren's. 
 Tues. May 29  Got up about 9.  Alice James got my Breakfast.  Went over to Adie's after Break. &amp; bought some Post Cards &amp; sent one to Lill.  Met Mr Pyatt, Tommy Adie, Mr Gilbert, Redman.  Had great old yarn.  All asked about Mother, France. Cis &amp; asked to be kindly remembered to them.  Must tell 'em when I write. Saw Mr &amp; Mrs Lawley, Mr &amp; Mrs Shaw.  Met Pat Astbury in street &amp; promised to go to tea &ndash; but missed. Met Jack Turner, "Tugger" Key &amp; a whole crowd of people.  Jack took me down to "the Swan"  where I met another crowd I knew.  Mrs Gorman, Snape &amp; all the "elite" of Abbey Court [a Methodist Chapel].   They flung their arms round my neck &amp; kissed me before I could get away.  Met Ern Harvey after Tea.  We had a very enjoyable time together.  Had a sing song at "The Alma".  I went home with him afterwards &amp; slept there.
