<p>night in Alexandria with McWhirter. One finds oneself in queer positions now &amp; again in a job such as we had then. I remember one night at 11 o'clock making an excellent supper off tinned salmon &amp; beer clad in my shirt on the wharf at Alexandria. Another afternoon not 200 yds away Yeats &amp; I took afternoon tea with a young lady of the Red X who sold tea &amp; cakes on the wharf. &amp; so on &amp; so forth.</p>
<p>Monday July 10th<br/>Just arrived back from a stunt last night. We started at 2 o'clock</p>
