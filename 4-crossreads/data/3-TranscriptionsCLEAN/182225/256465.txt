 DEC.   TUESDAY 12   1916 
 Cold but fine. Out exercising horses in the morning with Lieut Raymond, & I cleaned my harness up in the afternoon. I went into Salisbury for tea to see mother & spent the evening with her at the County Hotel. She is looking much better, & is going back to London tomorrow & coming on to Amesbury in a day or two.
