The hammocks are not too bad for sleeping in; you are frightened out of your life that they are going to break down with you when you first get in but once you are there you are right.If it gets rough I sleep up on deck, as the stuffyness down below upsets you, but I have only had to do that once.The stairs down below here are pretty slippery and at dinner time today a man was bringing down a dixie of potatoes; the first thing we knew was a shower of potatoes hit the floor, then a dixie with a crash & then a man looking pained and surprised.Poor wretch! We all stood up and cheered and sang out "encore" but he could not see the joke.
