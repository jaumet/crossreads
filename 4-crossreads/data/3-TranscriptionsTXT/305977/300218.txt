 Tuesday 25th [May] We were on fatigue nearly all the morning.  I was very tired after the previous nights duty &amp; just got settled down into a comfortable sleep when we had to shift again to relieve B Company.  At 6 oclock we moved into the supports.  The "Triumph" was torpedoed in full view of our position today.  She took 35 minutes to sink but most of the crew were drowned.  She had done some fine work here.
