is not varied or appetising but then 'C'est la Guerre' so no grousing.  We have seen a bit more of France since I last wrote.  I can't go into particulars but is it not all down in my diary & I shall enlarge on it when I get back.
It is simply great this France & the people & their spirit.  I think they are wonderful.
I haven't heard much of Poss, he is getting on all right.  The two Charley boys are with us still & are well.  I have seen more of the 14 fellows lately.  I really think I'll get back there if I can.  They do shine out in comparison to this mob.  The Macnamara boys are well & both Sergeants.  Billie Balcombe & Squiz Williams & Brolga Hill all well & thriving.
I struck a little shop here where they sold silk stuffs.  I hope you wouldn't mind such a piffling thing but I saw a little silk thing fairly plain but a gorgeous colour & I knew you'd like it even if it were only for the colour so I've sent it out & hope you like it & get it.  They had some lovely silk embroidered scarves & cushion covers & blouses.  Most natural looking flowers I've ever seen.  I'd love to have bought them all & sent out but I spend nearly all my money on extra grub.
I never told you I have most of your letters & that
