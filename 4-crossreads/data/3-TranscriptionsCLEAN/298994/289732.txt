at the rear of our billet
Old Dezzy, (our battalion hard case) acted in the capacity of cook and he deserves the M.M. for his services
I received a good bundle of letters from home while here.
We left Foilliz on the 22nd April 1918 and proceeded to Dours. Dours was a biggish town, alas deserted by the people!
No one knew our movements now, not even the company "dag".
The main road in Dours is crossed by the Somme canal. Some "Tommy" Engineers were busy mending up a bridge, Fritz had seen fit to knock about.
On the 24th/4/18 we were awakened from sleep by a loud bursting of shells Fritz had opened up a barrage on Dours There were a number of batteries just in front of Dours. The drew the crabs! We got to a field at the "toot" Shells were landing all around our billets by
