<p>6-3-19<br/>School has commenced today &amp; the routine is lectures 8-12 with &frac12; hour intervals &amp; 2 to 3 pm rest of day is free to ourselves.</p>
<p>Went down town this evening &amp; visited &amp; climbed Tranbordeur &amp; then went to St Ouen a beautiful Gothic church &ndash; we walked round the clerestory &amp; viewed church from various points There are 3 beautiful rose window. We then mounted to the roof climbed around it &amp; then breaking down the door that obstructed us we went to the highest part of the tower &ndash; a dangerous thing to do as masonry is not safe here. The tops of the spires seemed to me remarkably unsafe &amp; a good wind should blow over the crowning monuments. In future I shall keep away from churches in case they should fall down.</p>
<p>We then visited the Lower where Joan of Arc was imprisoned while awaiting trial &amp; the actual spot where she was burned Then I wandered among the back streets &amp; find that Rouen is a centre of much architectural beauty. The old crooked &amp; blind streets running into each</p>
