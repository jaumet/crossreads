  
 October 1916 away, but only four of them exploded, & he sent over a few more early this morning, looking for our heavy batteries.  I found Pritchard this morning.  (He is in No 1 Section & Sam in No 4.)  This morning after breakfast he & I went out together to Delville Wood, which is about 2 miles behind the front line.  We passed through the once village of Longueval, which is now nothing but a heap of broken bricks & not even the trace of a wall left standing. Some of our batteries are stationed near it.  We found some fine curios in the "Wood."
