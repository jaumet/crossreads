<p>miles behind the firing line, &amp; there are great guns all round us.<br/>Just opposite us the metalled road ends, &amp; if ever I saw a bog in my life well it is here all carts are double banked when the reach here, &amp; you should see the struggling it takes to get through it, there is no water among this mud, just pure sticky clay 3 feet deep, &amp; horses get stuck in it let alone wagons, our boys were helping fallen down horses up tonight it is impossible to describe it for it is a regular glue pot.  I saw tonight one of our little machine gun carts which is drawn by 3 men stuck, &amp; 2 horses &amp; about 20 men had to drag it out, &amp; the traffic never ceases there is one perpetual string of vehicles day &amp; night</p>
