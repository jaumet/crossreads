<p>It is a lovely day on top not too hot for although we are in the Red Sea it is winter time &amp; so not too hot.</p>
<p>Have been doing some washing wonder if I can get in before someone shakes it, I do not feel in the mood for writing with this Court Marshal at the end of my trip   all I am worrying about is the hope that I can let my friends &amp; people know what happened before we get to Melbourne</p>
<p>Mistake in the date. <strike>19th. Nothing much to report. Only that it is getting hotter daily, &amp; there are plenty of porpoises knocking about of a morning</strike></p>
<p>20th Am on guard today but there is very little to do as it is only a rag-time one</p>
<p>Awnings are being erected all over the ship as a protection against the coming hot weather.</p>
