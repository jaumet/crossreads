<p>To my loved ones at Home,<br/>An Ausy mail arrived this afternoon, &amp; I was very lucky in receiving a budget from Cairnleith, 2 from Father, one from Mother, 2 from Olwen, 1 from Walter, &amp; 1 from Anna &amp; I wouldn't exchange my home letters for a King's ransom.  It is just on 6 weeks since I heard &amp; I was awfully glad to hear from you again<br/>Thank you all so very much for all your welcome letters.  For 2 or 3 days after I get a budget of Home letters, I feel awfully miserable &amp; unsettled, I, who have thought myself immune from such maladies as homesickness<br/><u>Fathers</u> of 5 &amp; 12th August were as usual full of interesting news and what I value more full of personality.  Oh Father, dear, when is this rotten ghastly business going to be finished, &amp; let us all unite again in peace &amp; happiness.  I was indeed sorry to hear of your attack of influenza, but thankful you are in the hands of good nurses at home.<br/>Did I mention in my last letter that Percy Limn has been sent back to Ausy!  Lucky beggar.</p>
