<p>Saturday 25 March 1916</p>
<p>A bright sunny day, rather warm about noon but with a pleasant breeze blowing most of the time. Went to Pension Miles during the morning to see Oll &amp; had morning tea at Groppi's.</p>
<p>On duty as usual during the afternoon &amp; kept fairly busy with police work owing to the large number of men in Cairo on week-end leave.</p>
<p>After tea developed the films of Nile views.</p>
<p>Sunday 26 March 1916</p>
<p>Harry's birthday not forgotten.</p>
<p>A beautiful Sunday, sunny, but with a nice breeze most of the time.</p>
<p>During the morning Mearus, who has been on picquet duty here the same time that I have, was recalled in order to join up with troops from his battalion who are ordered to embark for at present an unknown destination.</p>
<p>Walked up to pension Wales about 10.30 &amp; found Oll all ready for church. In the Cairo streets everything was going on just as if there was no Sunday here &amp; it was good to mentally run over "O day of rest &amp; gladness". The Methodist church is on the opposite corner to the Pension Wales &amp; is really a long room on the first storey over some shops. When we got there about 20 people were present of whom all but 5 or 6 were in uniform, &amp; 2 or 3 came in later. A small party of abt 7 Devons from Kasr-el-Nil barracks formed part of the congregation.</p>
<p>It was good to be once more in church even tho' the sharp calls of the Egyptian sellers of various wares, together</p>
