 24/8 /18 Vequemont to us will fall the first blow of the stunt when it doe take place Went to dinner with Gener Robertson at 6th Bde H.Q . in the even when Col . Brazenor and Duggan were also there and our cheeri quack Doc Simmond . Dinner was a merri meal although our old waiter Victor ( of Savoy fame ) was much miss . His death has here left a gap . The war seem afar off as we dine but soon after , the crash of the antiaircraft batteri and a rattl of Lewi gun told of an air raid in progress . Walk back to our camp with Duggan . A splendid moonlight night with sweet scent of the summer in the air . In the moonlight faint finger of searchlight beam were look out for " Jerri " plane .
