<p>8 June 1918 Saturday<br/>Mugelahbar<br/>Took over Front Line as INFANTRY once more, same as the Peninsular, our Horses being left about 3 or 4 miles back.  We are in trenches close to Johnny Turks who shell if we make any movement-  very Hot &amp; many Snakes, Scorpions etc-  the Horned VIPER is very deadly &amp; a big brown fellow-  In between in No Mans Land are many Hares, Gazelle, Wild Pigs etc:-  My Squadron is split into 3 parts situated in Ironstone Boulders on edge of Valley-  We expect to be in the Trenches for about a fortnight-  Malaria bad, but I am nearly immune now after Portugese &amp; East Africa &amp; Quinine I've swallowed.</p>
