<p>Dear Mum &amp; Dad,</p>
<p>Well I am still well &amp; have a whole hide no holes through it as yet, it seems just to be a chap's luck if he gets hit or <strike>if</strike> not &amp; luck again if it's a bad hit or only a minor hit</p>
<p>We have just come out of the trenches after having a week in them we now have another fortnights rest as it is called but the rest consists of labouring road making, trench digging etc, etc, but for all</p>
