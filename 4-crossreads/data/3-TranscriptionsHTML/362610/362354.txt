<p>Thursday 18 May 1916<br/>A summer's day, quite hot in the sun. In the early morning heard an English cuckoo for the first time. Company on fatigue so went to dentist in morning. On the go during the day at little things &amp; at night again went over to the trenches, this time to carry on with night operations using blank ammun. Quite an interesting little piece of work which got us home abt. 10.30.<br/>More Austn. letters in.</p>
