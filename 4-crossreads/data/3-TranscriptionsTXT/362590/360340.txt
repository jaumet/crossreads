 Tel el Kebir 
 20.1.16 Dear Sir 
 I was delighted with your kind letter &amp; in return will try &amp; interest you for a few minutes. 
 I am at present at Tel el Kebir with 1st Div F.A. training &amp; working so that our next enemy will find us a tougher problem than the last. The Camp is very quiet, far removed from any town Cairo about 80 miles is the nearest.
