After this I went down into the big dugouts where Jock was camped to have a look how the miners were getting along, the dugout is easily 20ft deep is as warm as toast they hold quite a number of men.
Dead funny up here they carry the water for cooking in bags on their backs the boys go out with picks crowbars shovels dig it out of the shellholes it is a great thickness over a foot in places too hard to get it out.
The other night on our right the Tommies hopped over took 280 prisoners 2 machine guns, we put a very heavy barrage over on the German lines
31st Am taking up to the lines tonight 6 tins cigarettes they will be very welcome to the boys.
