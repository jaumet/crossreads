<p>Monday 28 April 1919<br/>Went everywhere looking for rooms or a flat. Did Earls Court, Edgeware  Road,  Southamptom Road &amp; all over the city. Had lunch with Harry. Met all the theatrical heads. Harry Weldon &amp; a host of others. Got fancy costume from Rayaio. Mine a cowboy &amp; Bills a Dutch boy. Looked well. Went to the dance &amp; thoroughly enjoyed it. Gee I had a bonny time. Mostly with Janet tho. The floor was good (had been an old ward) &amp; the supper magnificent. Do me. Started at 8.30 pm &amp; finished at 3.30 am. The sisters made beds for us on the floor in the dance ward so we were set. Went to bed about 4.30 am.</p>
<p>Tuesday 29 April 1919<br/>Up at 7 am. Got brekker at the hospital &amp; then Bill &amp; I kicked off. Bill to his class &amp; me to take the gear back. Had a shave, another brekker &amp; then got all our gear to the flat at Earls Court. Decided we'd go there. Met Bill for dinner &amp; then came here to the flat after seeing Marie &amp; Janet.</p>
