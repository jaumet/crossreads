<p>10 th.  Another inspection parade this morning &amp; all overcoats had to be cleaned,   it took me would you believe 3 hours to clean mine &amp; even then it was in a dreadful state, but good enough for me   yes "we have some mud alright up here on the Somme." In fact I have been practically all day long cleaning up my belongings &amp; even now they look dirty,  such is a soldier's life anyhow.<br/>I laid in bed this morning till just on 8 oclock for I felt far from well,  Jack Price brought me up a nice plate of porridge &amp; after eating this I felt much better, I don't want to go to the Dr. just yet for various reasons, but if things don't improve with me I shall have to go &amp; pay him a visit.</p>
