smoking a cigarette. The dressing was so great and the pain too severe, so much so that the patient had to be put under an anesthetic while being dressed.

There was a terrific bombardment of heavy artillery to-night. It began about 8.30 and lasted for an hour.

We were called out of bed to-night. Large numbers of wounded were expected to arrive.

The various wards are being cleared out of patients, preparatory to a big influx. Great preparations are being made in case we should be rushed with wounded. It seemed to be a false alarm however for we were all sent to bed again about 12 o’clock.

At four o’clock in the morning I was aroused out of bed and tumbled into the dressing room.

There were three stretchers fixed up on trestles and wounded men were on them, their wounds being dressed. They were covered with blood from head to foot. We were kept going with dressing after dressing till about eight o’clock, then there was a lull till eleven when we were again rushed with wounded and in the afternoon there was a repetition of the forenoon. This carried on to late into the evening.
