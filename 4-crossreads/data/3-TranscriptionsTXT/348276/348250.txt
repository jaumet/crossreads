 War Diary 1915  29th Nov. Snow all over the place  - very uncomfortable for the men, who have only one suit of uniform &ndash; one pair of boots, and many without cover &ndash; Two men shot by looking over parapets &ndash; white background &ndash; Trenches slushy and intensely cold - 
 30th Nov. Interregnum of 3 days silence cease and normal conditions again &ndash; The Turks in the meantime have become "Saucy" &ndash; It is intended to open on the trenches opposite with 2 Batteries allotted to this Section and blow out 2 M. Guns to-day -  My Saps and Tunnels into bluffs are now complete with surprise M.G. emplacements and lookouts, so that, if an attack is made, the enemy will be raked and enfiladed &ndash; Wire entanglements also complete round this section &ndash; New position being placed near Antill's Lookout &ndash; 
 It is intended as announced by Gen. Godley to reduce by one half, the local garrisons which without Suvla amount in (N.Z. &amp; A. Divns) to about 42,000.  This apparently on account of difficulty in regard to rations and supplies &ndash; But if a serious attack is made &ndash; questioned if so thin a line can hold &ndash; It is also questionable if these weather conditions continue, if we can remain at all, as no supplies have been landed for 3 days and there is about 3 weeks supply only in hand &ndash; The gales from the S.W. and snow from N.E. may be expected to occur from this on, and it is quite on the cards, we may be stranded without supplies or amm. or Reinforcements &ndash; Imbros is 14 miles away and it is there a Divn. Rest Camp is to be formed &ndash; Br. General F.G. Hughes who has been invalided from this Brigade since Sept. 20th is to be the Commandant  and Colonel Antill continues as Brigadier of this Brigade. A theft of rum took place on night of 28th (12 jars) 4 men in arrest awaiting trial by F.G.C.M.
