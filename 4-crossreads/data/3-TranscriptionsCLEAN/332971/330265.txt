parchment looks already & thoroughly enjoying the wholesome food.  So different from Madame Mealy dishes.
The morning we voted - for conscription or against it.  And do you know we are the first women in England who have voted on a National question.
25th  Two months to Xmas.  The girls are saying that the Xmas Mail closes next week.  I must stop.  This gossipy chatter though I don't like leaving you and wish you all the best that Xmas can give you.  If I should miss a mail sometimes - through pressure of work - please don't forget me.
Ever lovingly yours
A Donnell
PS.  There is a Sisters Mess Meeting to be held to-night & the funniest thing I have struck on A Service is a Sisters Mess Meeting - but serious business is to be discussed to-night - or protested against.  We find we can't manage - especially the S Nurses.  The upkeep of this Home (St Lukes School) however nice & comfy it is because apart from the 17/6 a week allowed us by the Gov that barely buys our food we have to keep a Staff of Servants - pay their salary - laundry & insurance & everything is so expensive/  It means that each one of us has to pay 10/- at the least out of our own salary & we don't feel it [indecipherable] too that we should be asked expected to do it.
Bye Bye
