<p>May, 1916<br/>later I had some tea but had not eaten any thing since night before &ndash; the mare drank so much that she looked like a tub &ndash; Capt Ryrie went down to it &amp; looked bad &ndash; we gave him some tea &amp; he went back with the ambulance.  At six we started for camp &amp; didn't feel too bad considering   We gave the horses some more water &amp; fed up, they knew they were home &amp; looked contented - Some of the chaps who had stayed in camp made tea for us &amp; it was just great - I had some bread &amp; jam &amp; later went down &amp; had a bath by emptying my buckets of water over my self &amp; didn't I sleep</p>
<p>Wednesday 17th<br/>We saddled up at 8.0 am &amp; came out to some palms &amp; hid our nags up in the shade, its burning  hot but there is plenty water thank goodness,   I just got a letter from Mum &amp; Joe Woods got his long looked for parcel,  Had a bit of an argument with Stevens.  Harold is better this morning &ndash; he got in late last night so did Joe Bill &amp; Perce &amp; several others.  Weve lost no horses as yet</p>
