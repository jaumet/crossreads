<p>7.9.15<br/>Tues 7th<br/>Last night about 8 o'clock I walked to the depot about a mile further along on the left of the offchance of seeing Mills and getting a loaf of bread from him, but my walk was in vain I put in an hour looking for him among the mule transports &amp; then gave it up as a bad job &amp; came back; A destroyer was firing at intervals during the night to make the Turks keep their heads down so as they would not discover our fatigue party putting out barbed wire entanglements; Stan discovered a plant while down for water this morning &amp; bought a box of chocolates for 6/-; We had no trouble to sell half the contents for 4/- here &amp; are keeping the remainder for our own consumption; An English mail today, &amp; I received another note book &amp; some papers from Edie. Stan &amp; Les were on duty on the 'phone till 4 oclock this afternoon &amp; as soon as they came off</p>
