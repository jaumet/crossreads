  
 together (British & Australians) in a very comfy mess-room warmed by a lovely heater. Quite a treat after the way we have lived the last 6 weeks. We expect one of our Senior Sisters any time now & then she will take charge. We really are 3rd A.C.C. Station, next to the 29th - but address letters to the top address. Goodness knows when we shall get our Xmas mail, but still it is worth the change to wait longer. I got a nice letter from Armie Thomas to-day & they are very lucky in money matters but I glad I'm a healthy woman, though blessed with very few of this world's riches. Dont write to Jackson. I've not heard a word & cannot find out anything. His great pal wrote me the other day from London, asking if I had heard anything of him because he also had not received any letters nor could find out any news of him.
