13. ThursdayStayed home to rest but had to run around & do housework so might as well have gone to cafe & earned a penny.  Threatening cold day.  Alister came & we had tea in the garden.
14. FridayStruggled down to Minerva, oh the terrible fainting feeling.  Dragged home at 5.30 & went to bed.  Arose for dinner & to receive Mr. Post & Mme Ja[indecipherable].  Heavy rain in afternoon & evening.
15. SaturdayCold greyish day.  Met F.P. at Piccadilly at 4 .m.  Went to see Australian pictures at Grafton Galleries.  Tea at 'Blue Bird".  Then talked a while in Park.  Came to Swiss Cottage & failed to find Bambacionis.
