<p>a new pen another Watermans  She has cost me 21/6 &amp; I am now using her for the first time.  I hope I have better luck with her than my other old favourite,  I also bought a nice pocketbook, so you can see I have started cutting into my wages early but I think I have enough to see me out,  I arrived at Eltham a straggling little town about 2.30 &amp; made off down to the address given me   I found the place alright but I am not allowed inside,  I made enquiries &amp; the girl told me that Mrs Oliver at present was out shopping  I swore to myself &amp; set off for a stroll round the town for an hour or so, so here I am fed up &amp; writing  in the Public Library, this is one of my days leave being slowly murdered</p>
