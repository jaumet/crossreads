<p>so odd.  All the tram conductors &amp; drivers wear khaki suits &amp; look very neat &amp; cool.  By jove, this is a lovely Hotel.  I suppose the Metropole &amp; the Australia are as good in Sydney, but of course we would not care to stay in those places in Sydney, they hit you up too much.  We had a 4 course breakfast &amp; had a nice French waitress to attend us.  We all threw in 6d. &amp; tipped her.  Well, we must run up the town &amp; buy some things as we have to catch the 11 a.m. train back to Fremantle.</p>
<p>Remember me to Mrs. Park &amp; the Girls &amp; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Allison &amp; Stephen &amp; assuring you, that we are having as we said we should have, a picnic, I will wind up.  We may take the motor to Perth it is so much nicer &amp; more to see.  We will make up a party.</p>
