7/4/17.
It was a wild wet night. We take the rations from here to the firing line. This is part of the grounds of what was once a fine old Chateau. It is a shapeless heap of rubble now. We do not loiter round those places for the Hun sets mines and other traps with diabolical cunning. 
8/4/17
A fine Day. Did the ordinary work last night. Received some mail. We have drawn bombs, extra ammunition, shovels etc. for we attack in the morning. By our orders we are supposed to clear p a large tract of Hun infested territory between now and tomorrow morning. Won't be surprised if we get it in the neck, these heads are too confidant. A chap on the baggage guard will keep this book for me until tomorrow.
