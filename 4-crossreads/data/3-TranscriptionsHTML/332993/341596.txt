<p>Nielles Lez Balequin 2.5 killometres away.  It is a much larger village than this one.  The New Zealanders are camped in it.  We met two of them in an estaminet and had several glasses of rum together, 6d. per large glass.  One of the men was 64 years of age.  His military age is 39, and he has a son in the army who is 42.  He is now on traffic control.<br/>We made several purchases &amp; had a walk around the town which is rather picturesque.  It has a water mill and a fine church the steeple of which can be seen a long way.  We got back before dark &amp; just before the rain came on.</p>
