<p>and went to a Theatre at night.  First one for about eighteen months, and you May be sure we appreciated it.  Following morning we left again for France, so you can see we crowded in a bit in the short time we were there.  Think the only thing we didn't hurry over was our meals.  One day there I weighed 11.7 and left at 11.3, so you can see I'm not fading away.</p>
<p>Am enclosing you a Photo I had taken in Eastbourne, didn't have time in London, so don't blame me for the result.</p>
<p>The last letters I've had from home have all been full of Barker's return.  I daresay they were pretty excited at getting some first hand news of you both.  Trust both you and Os are both keeping fit and that Jacko is not worrying you too much.</p>
<p>Excuse the scrawl, but it is now 2.30 and the frost has not gone off the ground yet, and it's too cold to hold the pen.  We are sure going to have 'cold feet' this Winter.</p>
<p>Remember me to Leo Johnstone if you come across him.</p>
<p>Write as often as you get a chance.</p>
<p>Your affectionate frere,<br/>Roy.</p>
