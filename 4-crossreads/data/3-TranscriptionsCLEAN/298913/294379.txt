Museum
The Museum is a big building near the Kasrenie Barracks. In front are numbers of statues & carvings in blocks of stone gathered from ruins in Egypt. On entering one has to pay a piastre to get inside. The inside is of beautiful stone & marble flooring with numerous galleries & columns each branch of the museum is in a separate room & each article is numbered so that one may obtain a description of it by buying a catalogue at the entrance.
Officials walk about & keep a sharp eye on the visitors & always examine the cases after one has inspected them. Some cases have priceless treasures in them. Every Friday afternoon an American takes soldiers through a part & explains the origin & history  of articles in detail, Which makes it very interesting. Ramesis lies in a coffin in a glass case & is watched by an official very carefully. The museum is by far too great to see in one day, as it abounds in marvellous works of art &ancient relics.
