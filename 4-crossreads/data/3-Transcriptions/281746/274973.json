<p>been very good to us providing us with a tent, plenty of reading material and an outside Cinema show at night time.</p>
<p>Nov. 26th<br/>Walked through scrubland to the Ocean on the other side of the Peninsular.  News has come through the "Devon" with the first lot of troops arrived in Melbourne and had a magnificent reception from the people.</p>
<p>Nov. 27th<br/>Went through the inhalor to-day.  This is an iron chamber with a few perforations in the side.  Through these holes medicated steam is put through and about seventy of us standing in this chamber for ten minutes are supposed to be immune from the deadly germs of Pneumonic Influenza.<br/>Saw a very pretty sight to-day.  Sailing down the bay was a five mast schooner.  This gave the place an old world appearance.</p>
<p>Nov. 28th<br/>Our time here is spent walking through the scrub or along the beach.  At meal times we have to scramble for to get into the dining room.</p>
