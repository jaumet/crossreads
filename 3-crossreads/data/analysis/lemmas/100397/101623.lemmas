 and loos herring in the boat wherev one look , the place just seem to be one vast fish mart . how mani load had been cart away befor we arriv I dont know but while we were there the carter were busi all the time take the box away as fast as they could . I had fresh herring for supper that night befor we went back to camp . the journey up in the train next day was like all journey per rail over here at this time of year , slow and tiresom we arriv at Bn . about 6 p.m. and hunt up the Coy . report then look for a place to sleep. next day the old routin commenc so there is no need to say more re my do sinc rejoin the coy . No need for me to say anyth Re Harri for I have no doubt that he will by now have told you first hand about his six day trip to Franc , and what he saw and heard dure that time . There is no need to worri ani about my ear troubl for I hope that they will be none the wors for gunfir when we get back up the line again , of cours if shell start drop round too close they may be affect again . the one that did the damag befor was onli a few feet away from my head in the edg of the trench and how the piec manag to miss us , is one of the thing hard to understand , still it wonder how close a shell can drop to a bunch of men without do ani damag especi when the ground is soft . The Rheurimatisn also has not troubl me late , I 'm glad to say . Perhap it is becaus I ve not had time to think
