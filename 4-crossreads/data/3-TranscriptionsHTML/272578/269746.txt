<p>27th January 1917. Woke at 8.30 Had breakfast &amp; kept ready for going on duty. Duty happened to be up at the first line trenches. Walked up to RL &amp; arrived at the trenches at 2 oclock. I felt rather shaky on it. It did not turn out at all what I thought about the trenches. Desolation &amp; quietness abounds everywhere at present up there. We reeled out our wire &amp; got into communication with RL &amp; through them to our Battery. I had my first baptism of fire while at the phone. It was a lively 10 minutes or so &amp; I took refuge in a sniper alcove which did not afford much cover. Anyhow I was dead scared while it lasted and am sure a heavy bombardment must be awful. Our Capt arrived at 3.30 [indecipherable] it was too late for any "strafe" so we left the works out &amp; came away via Japan Rd &amp; Willow Walk (a series of trenches which communicate with the first second &amp; third lines)! I was very tired &amp; hungry when I got back &amp; had a good tea. After tea fixed up the stove &amp; started our first fire. Thus ended one of the most eventful days of my life.</p>
