<p>Text reads<br/>Mena Camp<br/>Cairo<br/>Egypt<br/>5th Jan<br/>Dear Jim<br/>Convey to all the boys under you my sincerest wishes for a bright and happy new year. We were disappointed at being landed here, but it is the fortune of war. We hear that we are going to the front about the end of February. Hope so. If we are here for the summer I think we will be dried up on account of the heat. This is a wonderful country. It hast o be seen to be believed.all the nationalities of the world are here. We are camped just under the Pyramids. Rather miserable here at Chrismas &amp;amp: New Year. With heartiest of Good Luck to all Sincerely yours<br/>Sid Buckleton</p>
