<p>2 Sept, 1916<br/>Montazah<br/>I put in for leave on Monday so after getting the signatures of the Sergeant Doctor &amp; Adjutant on my application form the leave was granted.  2.0 am to 7.0 pm  Nothing flash about it but I wanted to look at Alex &amp; the glance I had was hardly worth the trouble as there was no time to go anywhere or do anything.  I caught the tram from Ramleh to Sidi Gaber at 5.55 &amp; when I got to the station the train was already moving away so I thinking that Sidi Gaber was on the branch line jumped on the train congratulating my self on catching it but I felt anything but elated 5 minutes later to find that I was on the Cairo express &amp; that Sidi Gaber was the junction of the two Lines &ndash; It was 10.0 at night when I arrived at Montazah but as I had got the name of &amp; address of an officer on the express certifying that I had made a mistake the Col. here did not trouble me about it</p>
