 6-2-17 Tue 6th Put in today cleaning up &amp; checking equipment for Sutherlands edification;  Artillery practice still continues &amp; Field days by the Infantry. Heard this afternoon that we are to go back 60 miles &amp; will be in a rest camp near Sagia, the majority of us would much sooner remain here as there is too much Regimental work in a rest Camp, we are counting on getting leave to Cario from Sagia Two of our 'planes came in at 7 oclock tonight &amp; was the cause of us standing to our horses as we thought they were enemy machines Got &pound;12 worth of goods from the AIF Canteen today between Frost, Browne, Laney &amp; myself.
