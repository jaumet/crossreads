<p>4.  Do you know I did not have an idea before that Bombay is really an island, though it is joined to the mainland by a bridge, and that it is only about 7 X 3 miles &amp; has a population of nearly 1 million!  My geography progresses!<br/>Then after our view we were driven back to the first <strike>after</strike> Y.W.C.A where we had afternoon tea &amp; then went on to the boat again at 5 o'clock.  Of course we paid for all the motoring about, lunch &amp;c but my share only came out to 7/6 and it was worth it every bit.  The natives in Bombay were not nearly so attractive as in Colombo but the same begging was not apparent.<br/>John procured some stuff- forget what you call it- and inoculated Gwen &amp; me for typhoid on the Sunday night at bed time.  We were rather off colour all day Monday &amp; Gwen has not been right since, though with me it was only troublesome the one day.  I am thankful to have it done or partly done, for we have to have another injection next Monday.</p>
