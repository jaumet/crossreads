<p>of <s>decayed</s> <sup>decomposing</sup> Turk haunts me in my dreams.</p>
<p>(23<sup>rd</sup> Sept)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Awaking at daylight I discover a Jacko - very dead - near our lines &amp; am very glad when we shift our camp <sub>^</sub><sup>on</sup> to a ridge some distance away.&nbsp; Here we open our first signal office.&nbsp; I sit on a rock with my telegram pad on my knee &amp; a bivvy sheet stretched over head.&nbsp; We work like blazes all day &amp; night as there is a lot of back work to make up</p>
<p>24<sup>th</sup> Sept</p>
<p>At <s>dinner time</s> <sup>midday</sup> we are off again.&nbsp; More rotten dust &amp; decayed Turk.&nbsp; The bodies by this time are getting very ripe.&nbsp; We reach Wadi Jordin about dusk &amp; relieve the 3rd Brigade who have on hand about 10 000 prisoners.&nbsp; Signal office again &amp; plenty of work.</p>
<p>25th Sept.&nbsp; I am dirty &amp; unshaven.&nbsp; Dirty &mdash; God. I was never so dirty <s>before</s> in my life <sub>^</sub><sup>before</sup>.&nbsp; I havent washed nor shaved for a week.</p>
