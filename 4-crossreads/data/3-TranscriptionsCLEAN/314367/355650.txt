No - the Eastern went to Pleasant  island right on the Equator & may have gone on to Ocean island - The probability is we wont melt."May the Lord - stiffen - at an early date - the commander who sent us on this stunt" is the pious prayer of Mr Bumpus -If the Eastern does not turn up we must go to Rabaul - for coal -  & we are ? 3 days journey  E of Rabaul -Its rather a difficulty to put in time - Reading is almost out of the question in the heat - The smoke room & wardroom are sweat boxes - The best thing is early bed on the poop with the stars in the velvety blue above you -Our dinner on New Years eve was - some ham, beans & rice pudding - Then we passed the Port & drank - The King - then we had several more ports - the bottle going round freely - then we adjourned & had the gramophone out on the rail of the ship - Pay came along & said he had an announcement to make - We went into the wardroom & found he had N. Year greetings from the Ship's company -
