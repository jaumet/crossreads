<p>I was getting on, having, as I afterwards discovered, tramped through fearful mud each time. Major Goldsmith who at one time was family doctor in Chatswood came once and expressed the opinion that within 2 months I should be able to return to duty. Capt. Minty paid numerous visits to see if there was anything he could do for me. Lieut. Hutchison, also a former 3rd Year Engineering student came in 2 or 3 times to see his brother, and R.E. officer lying wounded in the ward. One day Colonel Glassfurd (?48th Imp. Division) came to get any particulars I had concerning his late brother, and it was from him that I first learned that the Generals wound&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had been fatal.<br/>Eventually the doctor marked me up for and outgoing convoy and in the morning I was wrapped up warmly and taken in an ambulance through the biting cold to the hospital train waiting at the railhead.<br/>When we were at Etaples going through training I remember that frequently we used to watch convoys coming in and going out and more than once I said that it would do me to be occupying one of the cosy-looking bunks in the hospital train. Appearances are sometimes deceptive. The actual experience proved to be anything but enjoyable. The carriage was a similar one to our suburban cars with all seats removed and replaced by racks in which were placed tiers of stretches- all too numerous. It was artificially heated and really became rather oppressive as the journey proceeded.<br/>Several of the cases were very bad judging by the groaning and other signs of pain, and the journey down to the hospital at Rouen proved most trying, jolting and jarring was continuous and gave one the impression that the French track must be very badly laid or else in urgent need of attention. Better springing of the carriages would have overcome the difficulty. Frequently the train was pulled up with a jerk by the sudden jamming on of the brakes and several times in crossing points it seemed almost as if a wheel was off the line. Under ordinary conditions it would have been delightful to go through this country and see it under winter conditions but as it was the journey seemed interminable and at least one injection of morphia was given to relieve the pain.<br/>At last however it came to an end, and late at night we reached Rouen where by ambulance we were taken to No.8 General Hospital. As each motor drew up the 4 stretchers were lifted our and carried into the reception room where the doctor on duty allocated the cases to the wards. By some mistake I was marked up for a soldiers ward and carried up 2 flight s of stairs where I saw at once the mistake that had been made. In spite of protests they insisted on lifting me off the stretcher on to a bed which meant that when sister came along I had to be transferred back to the stretcher and carried down one flight of stairs to theofficers' ward.<br/>Here were spent the next 3 or 4 days, another period</p>
