<p>horns on his head (these fellows get themselves up most picturesquely), my friend (a sergeant-major) and myself decide to dine in the best hotel and &quot;do&quot; a theatre afterwards.</p>
<p>We take our seats at a table in the dining saloon of the leading hotel, we don&#39;t mind the expense, we are going to &quot;live&quot;, just for a while. The whole surroundings are of oriental design. The waiters are fine-looking dark skinned fellows, dressed in white, with turbans on their heads and sashes round what would in the ordinary course of events be called their waists. A blue sash denoted the ordinary waiter, a red sash the gentleman who attended to the wine department.</p>
<p>No one in uniform was allowed to have intoxicating liquors of any description, unless he produced a &quot;pass&quot; signed by one of the local authorities. We had no pass, but on taking our seats I noticed our O.C. sitting at a table nearby, and requested him to allow us to use his pass to enable us to procure some beverage. He absolutely declined to do so, and lifting up his glass, intimated that the contents were decidedly palatable.</p>
<p>I went back to my table and promptly called the wine waiter to without delay supply us with some liquid refreshment. He, after first ascertaing from me that we were not in possession of the necessary pass, requested me (in a whisper) to ask loudly for two ginger ales. I&nbsp;complied with his request. The result was highly satisfactory. He brought forth two large glasses containing whisky (a good lot too)&nbsp;and soda. Oh yes! it meant a good tip, but we scored so we didn&#39;t mind. I held my glass high and looked around at&nbsp;our O.C. and said &quot;Here&#39;s luck&quot;.</p>
<p>I have always found through life that one can get almost everything one requires, if one will go the right way about it. A little tact, a few well-chosen words, a little &quot;palm-oil&quot;, and its yours.</p>
<p>After dinner we went to a theatre, after which a good supper and a peep-in at the night-life of Durban then back to the ship.</p>
