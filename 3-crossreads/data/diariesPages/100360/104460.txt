Sat. Nov. 17. This morning the Col. (Shaw) came round & probed my wound for some minutes. Then he marked me for X Ray again. Received Parcel from Mrs Pudney containing Letters & a number of Photos of Lill & Nell at various ages.

Sun. 18. Was X rayed. They painted a big black cross on my Leg, so if I don’t pull through the Op. I’ll be alright for Christian Burial. After dinner Steeley & I went for a stroll down the village Lanes. There was quite a crowd of visitors but no one came to see me. After Tea, Sister gave a dose of oil & shaved my Leg in preparation for the "Hop Over" tomorrow.
