<p>Buire-sur-Ancre &amp; Amiens  1/11/16  We notice vivid flashes fleeting across the sky all night long as bombardments take place only 10 miles away but we do not hear a sound.  At Boulogne I have heard the guns myself and there are those who say the "boom" can be heard in England yet we can't hear them here.  The same phenomenon is noticeable in trench raids and other operations involving an intense bombardment.  In the area affected, the noise is not noticed &ndash; there is only the sound of "phut! phut!" like so many airguns. Another thing which is striking is the musical chiming of this music of death.  Each gun barks in different tone and if the guns are kept methodically served by the gunners their note must come in at regular intervals.  Hence we have a chiming hellish tune.  Rose at 6 am today and walked to Mericourt station with orderlies and the Dr Flecker.  Took train for Amiens and had an extremely slow journey.  Traffic blocked further progress about 2 miles out from the city so we left the train and pushed on afoot.  Much low lying ground and intense cultivation of villager's plots. Hundreds of German prisoners at work on roads and railways.  Saw some very fine looking N.C.O's among them. Caught a train at the outskirts of the city and rode in, passing a small column of young soldiers marching at the slope and carrying colours draped in mourning black.  Today is All Saints Day or the Fete of the Dead and all France is paying a tribute to its dead.  Most shops are closed, people are in black and wreaths are</p>
