<p>Thursday April 26.1917<br/>A cold dull cloudy morning.  Looks like rain.  There is no activity in the air this morning, but there was heavy artillery action last night.  Haig reports that there was very smart aerial actions, we brought down 15 Hostile machines &amp; 24 others were brought down out of control.  We lost two.<br/>A twin engined 3 seater hostile machine was brought down &amp; its occupants made prisoners.  40 machines in all, the greatest amount of air fighting in a single day since the start of the war.  Fighting along the front is of an exceptionally fierce nature.</p>
<p>Friday April 27.1917<br/>We were up at 6.30 this morning and had an early breakfast.  The weather is dull &amp; cloudy &amp; looks like rain, but it has been threatening this past few days but no rains fell.  At 9.30 we voted in the Australian elections both for Senate &amp; Representatives.  There are three vacancies for the Senate and one for each of the Federal electorates.  My electorate was Echuca &amp; I voted for Palmer, the Ministeralist and for 3 Ministeralists for the Senate.  I believe the Ministeralists is the present Nationalist party, and best for the soldier, best for the country and will end the war the quickest.</p>
