<p>evacuated.  Things in general fairly quiet even in the air as the offensive up north is still going strong.  We are still going back up there &amp; it hurts to read that Baillieu &amp; such places are now in the hands of the enemy.<br/>B section will in future attend to all gas cases so things will not be quite so heavy.</p>
<p>Friday 19th April<br/>Stayed in bed all day under orders &amp; the Major came down to see me.  Felt much improved in the evening so got up had a wash &amp; shave but fear that I overdid it as I don't feel as well now.  Will try &amp; get up tomorrow.  Still no mail, yet most of the others have received them.  Fritz still pushing up north &amp; I believe that we have lost Passhendaele &amp; Messines Ridge.  What lives we lost taking those places last year heaven only knows &amp; now they are gone in a moment.  Gas casualties still heavy mostly through our chiefs being careless or their officers and for which they will be hauled over the coals.</p>
