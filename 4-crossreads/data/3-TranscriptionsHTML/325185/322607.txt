<p>H.M.N.Z.T. No 3<br/>20th.10.14</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>Dident  think I would get the chance of writing so soon. Have had a very fair run so far was a bit choppy the second day from Wellington. As you can guess there were a good few sea sick. Things are going on very well up to now. There is no doubt when we get all the troop ships &amp; convoy. It will be a sight well worth the seeing. Not allowed to say too much now only it is very pretty to see the boats at night  now with the few we have. One can imagine what the full crowd will be like Will have a fair amount to tell you when I get back wont be abel  to give any news by letter. I am first rate have been all the time The Government have taken over the canteen. So chief has given myself &amp; mate charge of the saloon bar. I have all profits so there should be a little in it</p>
