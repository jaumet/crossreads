  
 the guards the W.A. Officers (Col. Batty did not appear) sent for Major Gallagher, our own Major who said that if the men did not go back he would resign, so they returned to camp. Friday 31/12/15. Short route march this morning - went to Perth in the afternoon where a great crowd were parading the streets whilst civilians actually took positions on the railway bridge and balconies to see, as they thought, the N.S.W. boys wreck the town. They had previously seen a few N.S.W. boys in a riot which wrecked Erpfs shop but the civilians started it.

This we did and Collins marched us to the Barracks and said we volunteered for picket, but they would not accept it. Next morning the newspapers said that about 200 men (meaning us) had surrendered.

Slowly we leave the land behind us fading gradually away as the distance envelopes it with a thin grey veil and the ships near the coast do the disappearing trick one after the other over the horizon. On the starboard side there is still a peninsula visable set in a
