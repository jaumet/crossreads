9.3.15
Tue 9thReveille sounded at 5.15 this morning & the troops filed off the lines at seven oclock, as there is a big divisional scheme on board;  I am still off duty & so was lucky in missing the scheme, as there is generally a mile or two of doubling over sand attached to these big schemes;  I put the morning in reading, writing & washing, a little of each, had a bath after dinner;  The 1st LH arrived back in camp early this afternoon, as they were annihilated about dinner time.  they rode right onto a battery of artillery belonging to the enemy before they knew it & were sent home
