<p>9.12.15<br/>Thurs 9th<br/>Received a parcel from Edie T. today.The  bombardment of the Narrows still continues; A Battery of Naval guns (landed) has been giving Snipers Nest &amp; trenches a rough time of it yesterday &amp; today; (Snipers Nest is only 350 yards from our trenches) Our aeroplanes are up every day &amp; busy as usual, but a German 'plane is scarcely ever seen; We received a rumor last night from Bde H Q that German workmen wanting peace blew up a German Arsenal &amp; damaged a second, but have nothing official about it. The Turkish Artillery are getting into a bad habit of exploding shells just at the top of this hill &amp; scattering shrapnel amongst us but doing no damage so far</p>
