  
 Marseilles  & had no time to take in stores. Of course I understand we are merely soldiers & the war might have finished without us if they delayed a few hours to get stores in. 
 Sun.  26th. March Some talk of calling in at Malta for stores. Aboard are the 4th Bn, Artillery Hdqrs, & Field Bakery Corp. also Engineers. 1st 2nd & 3rd Bns. left a day ahead of us. 
 Thurs. March 30th 1016. Landed at Marseilles at about 2 P.M. think we are off too Havre. Plenty of German Prisoners working around the docks & railway here. Entrained & started away on our journey. 
 Fri. March 31st. Still on our train journey & think we will have another night of it. Lovely scenery & splendid cultivated land. White roads winding about the green fields with red tiled houses of the villages scattered  around completing the colour contrasts. Best country to be seen - South of France - especially after having an overdose of Egypt - & it is inhabited by a most courteous race of people. Feeling is very bitter against the Germans.  They have the saying "After the War is finished;  We  Begin"
