  
 7 - is over. I hope Gibson will get some work in the home defence, though I think it is more likely that good billets will be given to men who were actually at the front. I feel very sorry for him. It was certainly hard lines after all those weary months in the desert to be invalided home and hang around hospitals as a private - most demoralising - I would think - instead of seeing service. Do tell him to write me. I expect he has to write to Iyseult - and that does    takes his time up. I wonder if the girls forwarded on the new pocket book I posted them for him after the other one I gave him was stolen. I have not written him as I hope he sees now my letters to you. I long to hug the darling boy again. It was awfully sad to me to feel he was passing me so near. I wish he had wired me from Suez but perhaps he thought I was at Lemnos. Precious Father I do think with Mother that you deserve the V.C. You are the most blessed dear of patient and hopeful dads. I do wish we could be a better lot of sons & daughters to you. I love you immensely
