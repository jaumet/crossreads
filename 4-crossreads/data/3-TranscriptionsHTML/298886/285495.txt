<p>Horse Regiment<br/>(Here follows the president and members of the said board.</p>
<p>The above effusion is one of the finest examples of red tape and officialdom I have come across for some time and quite worthy of a place here. Such good English and good ink and space to be wasted on the offending cheese! Why not go on the old adage "Let sleeping dogs lie"?</p>
<p>27th April. Thursday. Sohag. '16</p>
<p>Stringer has come back from Hospital but he is quite unfit for duty for at least another fortnight he still has a great open wound in his leg where the horse kicked him. Phillips has put in a transfer to the Artillery and he may go at any time now. I take "Pharaoh" down each morning myself to the Farrier Quarter Master Sergeant to get his leg dressed It has much improved lately. I intend taking him out for a swim in the Nile when he gets better. From frequent references to my horse it may be inferred that I am rather foolish in referring to him as often as I do and perhaps using words of endearment &amp; so on but what Cavalryman worthy of the name does not love his horse? I certainly do</p>
