The General who is famed for his geniality gave me a fine display of boomerang throwing in which he is expert.
The 1st and 2nd Brigades are moving towards Deiran tomorrow and I have decided to travel with them.
12 Jany /18
Reveille at 6 am early breakfast, out in the open under an old figtree. Tents struck, limbers packed and the columns moved off at 10 a.m. The seeming endless stream of men and horses winding their way across the plains, recalled to mind the great columns of the African fighting ants on their way to battle. 
Far away from the horizon the stream moved slowly along; over rises, into valleys, across streams it pushed impressively. The men were in high spirits, and the horses in good fettle. I rode my little favourite Abdul.
