intention of picking up all the luggage of the other boys taking it to wharf. It was appreciated by the boys as it is a fair walk to No 1 wharf Woolloomooloo. By 7 AM we had embarked, but it was some considerable time before the people were allowed on wharf. Had to wait for L Horse Reinforcements. 
We moved out into the stream at about 9.30. thousands of coloured streamers from boat to wharf formed a very grand impressive spectacle. Anchored near Clark Island. While in stream we were honoured by a visit from Gov General who bade us good bye safe return in a short but very nice little speech. Moved off at 3 pm. Cleared heads about 3.30 pm. Sea calm, felt fairly well. Bed 8.30 pm. Appointed
