 Saturday 25 
 Left by ferry for Inter Base &amp; after landing had to walk 3 miles carrying full kits to base camp. 
 This camp is pretty miserable but is situated on a hill with a good view.  There are 3 villages in sight &amp; they look picturesque in the distance.  The sunset over the hills reflected on these collections of stone house made a very nice view. 
 Food very poor &ndash; bread hard biscuits, rice &amp; bully beef stew. 
 Informed that we move on to Anzac in the morning at 7 oclock.
