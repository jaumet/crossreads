15thThe wind about an enemy attack has temporarily subsided.
17thOur Hqrs. moved out to a quarry to the left rear of the village Villers Bretonneux and all units stood to expecting the enemy to attack.  About 4.30 a.m. he opened up a heavy bombardment on all of our positions with large calibre H.E. and gas shells.  Gas masks were put on and strict watch ordered for any sign of the enemy.  No attack developed however and about 9 a.m. the order was given to "stand down".
