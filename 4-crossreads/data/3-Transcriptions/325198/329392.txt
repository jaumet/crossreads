<p>31 Oct, 1916<br/>Hill 70<br/>I feel tired to night, a bit sore too, I was weak enough to agree to play a game of footer &amp; its a bit to strenuous for my liking, I think croquet would be just about up to my weight now.  Jack Reid was copped by the Police in Alex;  The officer asked him his unit, "A fighting unit, sir" he answered.  Tomo was telling me of one of the boy at the Kersaal one night, presented a bunch of flowers to an actress, saw  another he thought looked nicer so took the bunch from the first &amp; gave it to the latter.  Godber &amp; Gal are going into port Said for a week to morrow - they have to go in full marching order in case we move off before they get back  There was a general inspection this after noon wonder if any thing is in the wind.  Stacks of rumours afloat a gain about an early shift but no one knows whether its the sand or back the other way.  Hats new tunics are to be issued in the morning also its pay day again to morrow.  nothing like money to give one the glad feeling.  Wish I was home</p>
