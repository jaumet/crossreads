  
 1917 Thu. 1st Nov. The "Hitachi" is having the more valuable portion of her cargo brought on board.   Silks, crepes, copper bars, zinc are going into the lower holds of "Wolf", and literally thousands of cases of tinned Japanese crab. 
 We had one splendid meal the first Sunday after "Wolf" caught the "Hitachi" when we got fresh potatoes, the fresh fish from (ostensibly) the "Hitachi", and two halves each of tinned apricots.    Today we got some of the tinned crab for the evening meal. 
 It was delicious, exquisite - but if we had known that we were to get crab, and practically nothing else but crab, for the next three months it would not have tasted so good. 
 Preparations are being made for many more prisoners. 
 The mine-rails were torn up, both on deck and in no 3 hold, some time ago.   Number three hold is now being subdivided up for the "Hitachi" prisoners.
