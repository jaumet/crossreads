 Air Fight 
 An hostile plane came over again early this morning &amp; visited us, then on to Duiedar, then to Hill 40 &amp; 70, meanwhile one of our own battle planes had time to get up &amp; was waiting for it right above us, the enemy was unaware of him until he swooped right down on him &amp; opened up with his machine gun, meanwhile the deutcher was off for his life, our chap gave chase &amp; rattled the lead into him, the deutcher was twisting, turning, banking, etc &amp; later he was seen to wobble &amp; finally he landed about Bir-el-Abd, our own also had to come down for Fritz planted a shot in his petrol tank.

 99 wks from civil life nothing doing this morning only they say it was our own gunners that brought our plane down &amp; wouldn't be in the least surprised, his juice tank was riddled. 
 Mr Smith sent us word that he would be back tomorrow leaving Cairo at 1800 tonight. I wont be sorry to see him for there's several things he can right in the troops. 
 Two more horses sent to Vet lines, one with lamanitirs  &amp; the other with a bad back.
