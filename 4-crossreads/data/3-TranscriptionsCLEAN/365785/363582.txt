  
 I have not been in Cairo since the end of June last so can't give you much news from that society centre.  I don't see much hope of ever getting to Cairo again.  Some say [place crossed through] is our next place for leave but it seems doubtful to me.  Anyway I think we are secure in the desert for some months to come yet though I do hope we don't have to put another  winter  summer in here.  The weather now is truly beautiful but another summer out here in the desert would just about be the limit. Ned Bartels is with this Brigade as a Sergeant in the Engineers.  He is keeping well & has plenty to do. Well Mrs Read, I must thank you again very much for the parcel & with kind remembrances to Dr. Read & best love for the children. 
 Believe me Yours very sincerely Jack Robinson
