<p>neglected you, but when we become settled down again I will write as regular as possible, now when you know there isn't any danger it doesn't matter so much but when we start fighting again I will keep you &amp; the Mater posted up.<br/>We are being organised again &amp; receiving heavy drafts of reinforcements preparatory to a scrap in spring at least that is what we think they are fixing us up for. We have so many new faces now both in officers &amp; men that one feels quite a stranger in his own regiment, after we have what is called the next "thinning out" Parade there wont be an old hand left.<br/>Well dear I will close now with fondest love from your loving brother Ken to self, R &amp; B.</p>
