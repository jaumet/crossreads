<p>4 &ndash; about the movements of the troops &ndash; they are moving &ndash; but to France or Mesopotamia we do not know.<br/>We evidently are <strike>not</strike> going to stay here &ndash; the other hospitals, it is rumoured are moving. I am content to be here &ndash; though I should like to be where our troops go. There are heaps of wonders to be seen here and I feel I am very priviledged to be here. Though I find it difficult to appreciate them as I would have if there had not been war.<br/>This is a boring letter. The other sisters are in the room now and talking, so I can't write. Much much love to you &amp; Father. I hope you are well, my precious parents. I long to see you. Much love to Constance &amp; Ernest Bill &amp; Edith &amp; Roslyn &amp; Auntie Cousin Lily &amp; Percy<br/>Your very loving daughter<br/>Betha McMillan</p>
