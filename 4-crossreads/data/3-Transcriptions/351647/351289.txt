<p>Brian Mac sends his kindest regards &amp; dear old Bill Holt asks after you.  Bill is the real true metal all right.  I see the fourteenth fellows &amp; in fact all my pals much oftener now as in this new job I get round them.</p>
<p>I'm glad the book is progressing &amp; am dying to read it, mind you send me a copy of the typed proof.</p>
<p>Glad you are at Manly &amp; enjoying life, oh I wish I were down there too.  Never mind perhaps next January or February.</p>
<p>I'm well &amp; very comfy but tonight tres fatiguee so will off to ma lit.  Compres vous.</p>

<p>Yours as ever<br/>Jim Wilkie</p>
