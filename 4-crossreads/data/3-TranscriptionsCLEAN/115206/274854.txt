  
 October 1918. Friday 11 
 With 2nd Batt 120 Regt. Vaux Vigney. Spent a putrid night and had a pretty rotten spin in a little skeleton trench. Fritz being busy all night with mg and whiz bangs. Hopped the bags once again at 4.58 am with a very weak barrage. Got the first objective where we were relieved by a L'aison party from 11th Bdge. Walked to Bahain and travelled from there in a staff car to the outskirts of Ramicourt, where we found our batteries in reserve. Slept all day the sleep that I'm sure I have well earned.
