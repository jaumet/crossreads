<p>right back over the 5 or 6 miles distance to Green Dump.  This we did in 5 hours, losing our track more than once.  I fell into the mud 5 times but all the others were worse off.  Absolutely exhausted when we reached A.D.S. where they gave us cocoa.  Glad to reach Green Dump at 1 am tonight and get our wet things off, also to get some stew and tea.  During the two days we have been out our rations consisted of 2 loaves for 13 men</p>
