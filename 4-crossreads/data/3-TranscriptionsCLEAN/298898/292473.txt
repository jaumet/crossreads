  
 Friday 23rd March After fixing up things for the day at "The Tunnel" went down to our old post at Bernafay to see about getting drugs for "Bapaume". Fixed that up so filled in the afternoon by going for a ride round "Contalmaison" way to see how things were going. All guns had been removed except two 12" naval they waiting for the railway to be fixed up. Came onto one road where they were taking up the metal etc. for use on roads of more importance further up. Arrived back by dark & was about to turn in when a special messenger came from Bapaume for dressings urgent. This meant I had to turn out 6 men & myself load them with two sandbags full each man & set off about 10 oclock in the dark along the duckboards. As Fritz was well away I took two lamps so that no time would be wasted. Luckily a limber met us
