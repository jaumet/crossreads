Move up to Borre A.D.S. again. News to hand of a new German attack North South of Reims but I do not know the results. The 1st Aust. Division is being relieved a brigade at a time by 29th Division they go back to Arques (Arces). The Tommies take over the right sector to-night.

Last night or early this morning rather the heat of yesterday was followed by a terrific thunder storm. Several of our bombing ?planes were caught in it. To-day has been oppresively hot. Nothing happened on the front.
