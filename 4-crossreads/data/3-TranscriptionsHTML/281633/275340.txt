<p>a bit of a rush to buy Papers.  The Frenchies are wild with joy.  Flags are being dug out of all sorts of odd corners.</p>
<p>14.11.1918<br/>Frost still on all day.  Went to a Dance in an Estaminet last night.  Met some prisoners &amp; the Sergt. of the Guard drinking in another.  Drank quite a lot of Vin Rouge.  A lot of our boys have been getting hidings in Flixecourt lately, from Tommies, there is no love lost between them.  Our Camp Dogs "Steve" &amp; "Spot" the former especially have been taking walks with Jim &amp; I in the mornings.  Steve's antics on being shown a Mess Tin by Wallie were very laughable.</p>
<p>21.11.11<br/>Mr. Wright notified me that he had despatched my Diary on the 18th.  On the evening of the 19th I was walking into Saint-Ouen when I was run down by a side car.  My left ankle sustained a severe wrench.  I was brought back to Camp in a motorcar &amp; have been stuck in bed ever since.  The A.M.C. man wanted to send me to Hospital but at my request allowed me to stay in camp.  He is treating me himself.  I think it will be a couple of weeks at least before I will be able to hobble anywhere.  Stiff luck to get a knock one week after peace.  I would have had a chance for Blighty if it had been war time.  Jim Clarke was with me when it happened.</p>
<p>Sunday 23.11.18<br/>Poor little Steve was shot this</p>
