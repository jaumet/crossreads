17 July 1916
Monday
Rained all night, slept in huts on bumpy ground. Feeling good, pack not so heavy. discarded more of my belongings at last place.
Stay in our billets all day. Huts unhealthy, damp mould on ground.
Pay in afternoon. 40 francs. Short rations for tea, go down to village supplement same with eggs and cafe. Mud slush on road very slippery. Talk with some French soldiers. Mutual effort to speak each others lingo. not too successful. 
Impromptu concert in hut on return
