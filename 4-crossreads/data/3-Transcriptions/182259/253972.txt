<p>.......of two miles from the spot. The afternoon we spent in looking over the Zoological Gardens there is a good collection on view there.</p>
<p>15th Feb&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a look at the change of guard at Buckingham Palace, It is a sight worth seeing as they are well trained soldiers, and they all move together as one man. After dinner we were advised to see the wax works. There is a fine display of figures, everything looked so real that some of us were taken ?abc ?isc&nbsp; by finding ourselves speaking to a wax figure, taking it for a person on duty there, at one entrance to the big hall there is a girl at the door selling tickets done in wax and quite a few walked up to buy a ticket, thinking one has to pay to go in. There is a wax attendant quite handy &amp; some being doubtfull about the ticket make straight for the attendant to ask and of course receive no reply. There was rather some queer sights to be seen in the chamber of horrors, and I am told a large sum of money would be paid to the person that would sleep there of a night. We had to return that night with an officer in charge of the leave train. When We left the train at Wilton, the officer in the lead took the wrong road...............</p>
