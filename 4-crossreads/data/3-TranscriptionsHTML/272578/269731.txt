<p>9th December 1916 Reveille 5 o'clock. Left camp with staff at 7 for the range. 7th &amp; 8th Brigades shot from two positions. Shooting splendid. Day was rather good but cold. After we march past after shooting was over the General [indecipherable] spoke to our officers. He spoke well of our Brigade as a whole and remarked it was the best performance he has had in Salisbury for a long time. All our shooting stunts turned out well I think. Got back to camp at 2 o'clock and was very disappointed to find that my weekend leave was cut out. Anyhow I did stables and at night went to the Pictures.</p>
<p>10th December 1916 Early morning stables. Harness cleaning &amp; midday [indecipherable] horses &amp; stables again. This not our Sunday rest idea. I don't think [indecipherable] in part of the day. Wrote a letter to Millie, Beattie &amp; Katherine.</p>
