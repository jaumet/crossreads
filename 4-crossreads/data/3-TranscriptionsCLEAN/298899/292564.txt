  
 full speed fixing up the Battalions with the stuff they required to go out early in the morning.  Heard the taubes over at night again, the searchlights & anti-aircraft guns making quite a good display.  One machine bombed "St Omer" killing seven & wounding 22, we could follow the machine over & on its way back again. Thursday 23rd. Aug.   Friday very quiet again went out for company drill in the afternoon good practice, & took my turn drilling the others.  Mail arrived at last had a few from Australia & a parcel from Glasgow. Saturday 25th. Aug.   Very little doing so managed to write a few letters.  More company drill in the afternoon.  At night had a mild hopover & farewelled Capt Mc. as he was going to the Artillery next morning.  More rain during the day, harvesting not quite completed.
