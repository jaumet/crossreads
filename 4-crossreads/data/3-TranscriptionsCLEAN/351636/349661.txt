  
 Dear Mrs. White, After enquiring yesterday we find it would be best for you to go up to the Camp at Liverpool yourself, and find out from your Son's Commanding Officer, or the Camp Commandant Col. Kirkland, or Capt. Wallace Staff Officer -  if your  or Col. Simpson if your son has made out his papers. If not you can get the forms there as they are always made out at Liverpool - not at the Barracks. 
 If your son has not married he would have to make an allowance in your favour.
