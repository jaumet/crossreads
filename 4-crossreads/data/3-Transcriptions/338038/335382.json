<p>II<br/>I have told you in my previous letters all I could of this so won't make any further comment.  I have been doing what I can for Gerald over here to get him up to a Unit &ndash; (He is still in details) and I think have got him fixed up now to come to this Brigade.  Letters come along regularly from Exeter.  They seem to like their new home very much on Thor[n]ton Hill &ndash; The place they were in when I stayed with them was a charming little home and it's a great pity they were</p>
