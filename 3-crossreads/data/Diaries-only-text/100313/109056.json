15/1/18 London
By tube to the Bank and got my letters and then bussed down to Ludgate Circus walking thence to Old Bailey. The trial of Jones Maguire proceeded all day and culminated at 7 p.m. when the Judge (Darling) sentenced the latter to 10 years p.s. regretting he had not added a flogging too. Then he proceeded to sentence Jones to death. An impressive scene the court in darkness electric light, the jury lawyers police and the lean scarlet gowned judge with a black cap on. A woman crying was ejected and the crier called out "O Yea: O Yea O Yea" as he delivered his cautionary word. The sentence "to be taken back to the place from whither you came and thence to the place of execution there to be hung by the neck until your body be dead and may the Lord have mercy upon your soul!"
