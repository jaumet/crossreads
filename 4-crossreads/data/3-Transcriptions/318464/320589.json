<p>Walkers Ridge<br/>That evening marching orders were received, and the battalion had just fallen in, when a Turkish shrapnel shell burst in our midst.  It took the leg off a sergeant <strike>and wounded</strike> also wounding several others, and it was astonishing that it did not do more damage.  We moved off and got into the sap, passing by a Ghurka encampment, also the New Zealand encampment, where a large hospital and store were kept opposite Tunic Bair.  Arrived safely at Mule Gully, which is at the foot of Walkers Ridge, <strike>and</strike> then started a precipitous climb, which was an ardous job, with full packs on, including blankets and firewood.  We relieved the Leinster Royal Canadians who had been in supports on Walkers Ridge, when the Light Horse charged.  These Leinster Royal Canadians are not Canadians at all, but simply Irish;  it is only a name, and certainly a misleading one.  This place was taken by the Third Australian Infantry Brigade, and held by the Light Horse.  On our arrival here, the Turks greeted us with a heavy machine gun and rifle fire, to which we promptly replied.  A month befor our arrival, the Turks charged, and were beaten back.  On Aug./5/15 the Third Light Horse Brigade charged with disastrous results, as the Turks had fortified their trenches with machine guns.  Out of 3,000 Light Horsemen, less than 300 were mustered at Anzac.  A number of English must have assisted them, because when we cut a small trench into No Mans land to establish a machine <strike>position</strike> gun position, we found their bodies;  (the Durhams, I believe they were).  This position was intended to be kept hidden, in case of an attack, but it was exposed</p>
