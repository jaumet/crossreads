  
 3 Saturday 
 Trees practically still in full leaf but tinged a little with Autumn. Sister Davis & I went to Vodena at 7.15 with Mrs. Green, Webber driving.  On getting free of the latter we hunted souvenirs in Main Street.  Then called at Bellevue for cup of coffee & on to call on Sister Harvey at Wounded Allies.  Then to Serbian Camp & got Lt. Borzidar Djordjivic to give us lunch.  Met S. Harvey who took us to see Am. Mission of gipsies.  Left on train about six in carriage with French Soldats.  J. Boisson very charming.  Home by 7.15.  Grey day but no rain.
