  
 Our friends about soon heard we were leaving, so we have been rushed with visitors. I have some great pals amongst the boys   &  one especially but only a good friend. Nothing serious again with this old bird. If you should hear anything you will know it is only talk. 
 We. (Dorothy, Annie Bell, self, Capt Bell   &  Major Simmons) had a lovely outing on Friday. Left here early in the afternoon, went to Pozieres   &   had a rather sad time, poor Annie had a brother killed there   &  she thought may be find his grave but oh, the number of unknown A.I.F.
