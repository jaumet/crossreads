After about eight miles marching, with mud up to our ankles, we arrived at Ergnies a pretty little old fashioned village, where we billeted at a farm. A fine residence it is where B. Sec. are, nice cool cool brick floor and plenty of freshair in through the broken windows and down the chimneys We strolled through the streets in search of a shop or estaminet, where we could buy something, but every place seemed to be sold out. About 6 B.Sec. fell in and marched down to the cookhouse for tea, singing "we are a ragtime army" Maudie and Milly were in great form. Molly said some funny thing ending in "Have not they" which of course started the mob laughing. The 2 M's got real wild, and Maudie called us a "log of skinks" which amused the crowd more than ever, we had B.B. stew, Jam, Butter and "praise the Lord" some tea. It seems ages since we had tea before, and it went down real well. After tea we had a "slap up" "sing song" B. Sec. were positively brilliant, and the talent that showed up was amazing. Harry Douch sang in an almost professional manner, each song being greeted with salvoes of applause and onces of "more" The choir joined in the choruses with great gusto "Miles" Sheehan gave a speech on "why I enlisted" and his remarks greatly appealed to the younger member of B.Sec. The "Roam Colt" gave us a few interesting reminscences and also recited "The wattle round Michenburg" in a most touching manner. At intervals the choir rendered well known choruses and the part singing was very fine indeed "Payney" who, some time ago, figured in "Talk of the town" explained the reasons for forming the "Philarmonic Society" It is expected to render assistance to men who are disabled in the war. To become a life member only costs 5 Francs, but members are very backward in coming forward and Mr. Treasurer Payne informed me this morning that he only had 2d in hand, so our finances are in a very low state.
