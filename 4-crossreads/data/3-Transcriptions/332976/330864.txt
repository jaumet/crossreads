<p>May 1917<br/>25th   This morning the section went out to Fremicourt where a part of No 3 section have been building a heavy bridge.   The bridge is to be constructed over the Nord Canal, (a part of which is still in Fritz's lines) <strike>&amp;</strike>   We took it to pieces &amp; stacked it ready to be transported up when the opportunity offers.<br/>This evening the company held an open air concert in a paddock near by &amp; with the aid of the 20th Divn Band it proved a great success.<br/>The good weather still continues &amp; to day has been very warm.</p>
