that in modern warfare more men die from exhaustion & from the severe forms of infectious diseases than from mortal wounds.  If we have sufficient reinfcts. handy the ground women have held & positions consolidated men in the front trenches can be regularly relieved & rested.  They are thus less liable to disease, & less liable to die from their wounds.  But if we fail to send the necessary reinforcements our men, those boys so dear to us may be wiped out or die of exhaustion.  Is there anyone here who has not read time after time that positions won by our men after cruel fighting had to be abandoned, because there were no rcts. [reinforcements] or they came too late?
