to Dr. my complaint but he ridiculed my opinion.  He puts me in mind of an ex-jockey.  I told him my trouble was intestinal & he laughed, & wanted to know how I knew such a thing.  Why ask my opinion, when I was evacuated from Gallipoli with jaundice & lumbago.  At Luna Park they would do nothing for lumbago & sent me on here for sulphur baths & massage.  Finish sulphur baths etc.  Wrote Mabel another long letter & sent her P.C.s (one each) of the hospital & the Baths.
The food here is excellent, also the accommodation - its an ideal place to recuperate, the climate is dry & the nights are warm, though heavy fogs visit us early morn, but these are soon dispelled by the rising sun.
