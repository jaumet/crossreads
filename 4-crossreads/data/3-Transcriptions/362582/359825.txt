<p>Fancy not telling you the name of my <u>Beloved</u> - well Sydney Jackson Chapman. I thought I had described him too &ndash; hope it wont be long before you all know him. So pleased to hear that Charlie has got his Commission. I wonder if I shall meet him out here again. Hope we meet in England. Received two Church Papers from Mr Capp to-day. Give my love to all my friends. Had a most interesting letter from Will Loughrey last week &ndash; it has travelled a bit. He is a good old sort &amp; Charity is a lucky girl having such a good husband &amp; able to be at home with her. Must stop now it is getting late and I must write to my beloved one, in case a mail goes to-morrow. I believe I've a day-off to-morrow &amp; going on night-duty next Sunday so must get my things ready to move to other house. it is the rule now. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. From your loving sister Edith</p>
