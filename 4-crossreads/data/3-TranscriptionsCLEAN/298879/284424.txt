August 1915Friday 20We are still holding on to the trenches which we captured on the 6th. The Turks are always throwing bombs at us, as they are only about 15 yds away in some places. They seldom do any damage though. Now and then they knock somebody over. Their quick - firers do more damage than any of their weapons.
Saturday 21Fine.   Once more ready to go in the old trenches. The men had dinner there as it was nearly 12 noon. Turks bombed our trench a lot but did no damage. Great to do on the left. The 9th army Corps (British) took two lines trenches & the N.Z's took one and they are holding them.
