<p>11/2/16<br/>Was "the first man up" in camp this morning &amp; buzzed round early. Bayonet fighting the first parade. Digested mail and at 0900 went out with Colonel Norris to select a position for a rifle range out in front of the outposts. Noticed some pieces of paper blowing round and had steps taken to avoid same in future owing to the use documents &amp;c might give to enemy. Decided on a site using the sandhill called the Punchbowl as a mound. Fine view of the canal and the blue rises beyond. Running like a living ribbon through the desert. A four funnelled warship signalling and some big guns firing further south.</p>
<p>After lunch tried to pick up "C" Coy doing artillery formation but missed them. Across sand hills to the south and noticed snails crawling with white shells on their backs, also two beetles one (dead) an ordinary black beetle the other with little studded projections all over his back and a body spider shaped. Small tiny tufts of a shrub in places quite green and one with a tiny blue flower. Whitish stunted bushes covered with long shiny needles fairly common.</p>
<p>Had a look at our miniature range and the bayonet fighting "field". Where the sand had drifted away in one place came upon a large number of white bleached bones probably animals' but a leg bone had a human look. Beside the caravan routes in places are these bones. Took notice of the imprint of camels feet although not much larger than a horses foot, the camel's only leaves a slight impression in the sand, "the pad" not indenting the sand much. Native drivers in bare feet. &ndash; Their feet larger than the average European and very broad across the toes as if spread out there. Our company out on route march brought in 3 Beduins and camels under arrest. Down the lines after dark the men were indulging in blanket tossing. Furphey from Staff Capt we are going to Mesopotamia.</p>
