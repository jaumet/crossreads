<p>28<br/>this village called Canaples, &amp; are quartered in the "Town Hall" &amp; slept on the Mayor's table. It is very dull &amp; has rained a bit we move on again shortly. We are on the bank of a small stream here &amp; it is very pretty. There is a little bridge across &amp; it recalled to me the yarn "Why is the old rustic Bridge like" etc.</p>
<p>21/7/16<br/>Still at Canaples but nothing exciting has happened. The weather has been perfect these last few days, it is a treat to be in the sun after the rainy dull weather we've had.</p>
<p>Last night the Adjutant told me I could go for a joy ride this morning in the car if I could get up early enough. Stan was up in time you bet</p>
