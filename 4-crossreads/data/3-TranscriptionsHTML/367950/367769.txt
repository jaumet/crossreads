<p>have just returned safely. The regiment has just had 7 units sent them &ndash; only 7<br/>Have not been feeling too well all day don't know what is wrong!<br/>To quote Kipling &ndash;<br/>"Ive got a head like a concertina<br/>And a tongue like a button-stick<br/>And a mouth like an old pestater<br/>An' I'm feeling a bit more'n sick".<br/>The unexploded aerial bomb which fell near our camp this morning should have had a decent &ndash; and quiet &ndash; burial But some of the boys cannot rest content so they pulled it about, looked at it from all angles, let it fall, kicked it, photographed it, and then I see someone has just gone past my dug-out with it swinging in his hand. The odds are of course that it <u>is</u> a<br/>"dud" after dropping so many thousands of feet and not exploding there is a fair chance of it not going off just now, but &ndash; it was made and meant to explode, and a movement in a certain direction may start it into activity and most unexpectedly it may go off and   then someone &ndash; whoever survives &ndash; will say they did not think it was dangerous. "Let sleeping dogs lie".<br/>Last couple of days have been facilitated by shoals of pelicans gyrating in the air like troops at drill they are interesting to watch.  They form all sorts of military formations over us.</p>
