<p>or not that morning, he would not let me go.<br/>I was terribly disappointed, &amp; determined that when <u>he</u> wanted me to go, I would refuse.  Sure enough on early flying (about 5.30 am) on the Tuesday, he asked me if I felt fit for solo, &amp; altho' it was a perfect flying morning I wouldn't go.  He asked why &amp; I replied "It is the 13th of the month".  He mumbled something about a "superstitious old fool", but I would not budge.  However another pupil, (Lieut Viner,) took this same machine out also on his first solo.  Exactly what happened, he doesn't know, but it is my belief that one of the control wires broke just after he left the ground, &amp; he crashed into one of the new hangars they are building knocking unconscious 3 workmen, but he himself escaped with a gash in his forehead.  Photos No 1 &amp; No 2 show the crashed machine just after we pulled the unconscious pilot out of the wreck.  No 3 shows my first attempt at a photo from the air at a height of 2,000 ft. on my 2nd solo.  Taken with my camera, a No 2 Brownie, 1/50th sec. stopped</p>
