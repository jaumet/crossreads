<p>XMAS 1916<br/>Monday 25th   Christmas Day<br/>It rained like billeo all night and accompanied with the rain was a particularly severe bombardment by our boys.  In fact it was just one continual roar for some time.  I was on duty all day but the dinner we had was truly worth remembering.<br/>Some day previous the boys had got a turkey from the village &amp; potatoes &amp;  a host of other things which only cost us about 5 Francs each.  The menu was excellent and we were lucky enough to get a holly branch making it appear O.K.  Turkey, baked spuds, pickles cabbage, bread, Coffee &amp; milk (tinned stuff but good) then to follow Tinned pudding from the Comforts &amp; tinned fruit nuts boiled lollies ginger &amp; dates in galore.  How's That.  We have enough over to last tea time.<br/>Burkitt &amp; Egan &amp; I have just completed the erection of new latrines &amp; they are some. Souvenired all the material.  Today the river has flooded &amp; is only about 2 ft from flooding us out of our billets.  All the surrounding country is one sheet of water and it was no wonder that no progress could be made in this region in previous winters.  (River Lys)  Very strong wind today &amp; rather cutting too.<br/>This afternoon am doing</p>
