 My dear Babs R., 
 I haven't written  for  to you for some time, I hope you'll forgive me, and although I have been on the point of doing so several times & wanted to do so just to talk with you & pour out my woes I have never brought myself up to scratch, for though I have simply longed for you to talk to & have your sympathy as I feel sure I should have  done  had, its much harder to put it on paper - I know you are the sort that understands & would make me feel ever so much better for the telling to you, even as you seemed to think in one of your letters that I too could understand & sympathise.
