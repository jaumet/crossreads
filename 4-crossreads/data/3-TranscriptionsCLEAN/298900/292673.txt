Again sent back several men who were not quite bad enough to be evacuated.     After tea had a game of hockey which my team won as usual.   A stunt expected tonight so will sleep on the premises in case of a rush. 
 Thursday 11th April     Nothing doing during the night.   Big sick parades during the morning.   After dinner made out a requisition for drugs etc & went along to Namps to collect them.    First went to Amiens about 9 miles for a refugee to collect some gear & then we proceeded on to a place near "Hornoy" passing through "Pissy" & Fluy.  After dropping our passenger we went across country to "Namps" where the depot No. 13 had set up shop after having to evacuate from Nam.     The stock they lost there is reckoned to be worth over 40,000 as they had stocked up for the stunt.   We passed a large number of people leaving Amiens which had been heavily shelled, & making for villages further back.   Horses & carts being scarce, many old people had their belongings packed on wheelbarrows & it was a sad sight to see them resting by the wayside.   Waggon after wagon was passed
