  
  HOSPITAL LIFE  4:12:15 to 14:12:15 - Life on the hospital ship was pleasant and comfortable.  A member of the 17th Battalion died and was buried At Sea.  We arrived at Alexandria shortly after breakfast on the 5th, disembarked and boarded trains for Heliopolis.  Red Cross nurses served us with tea, bread and butter and other comforts on the way across.  Admitted to Luna Park Hospital.  What a comfort and luxury to get between clean sheets.  All my old clothes were taken away and I was issued with leather shoes and a complete outfit from undershirt to jacket and pants.  The treatment was excellent.  The nurses abounded with kindness, and the Red Cross provided us with comforts every day.  I entrained at Bab-el-Louk on the morning of the 11th for Heloun where a palatial building (formerly the Hotel "Al Hayat") had been taken over by the military and luxuriously fitted up as a hospital.  Surrounded by extensive grounds, gardens, tennis courts, etc., it was replete with everything for the convenience and enjoyment of the sick and wounded. 
 25:12:15 - Christmas Day!  Treated well - a splendid dinner and Red Cross Gifts.  The dining hall was artistically decorated with palms and the Australian Flag, and the main corridors leading to the wards were also resplendent with bunting and greenery.  The piazza also was appropriately decorated.  In fact, everything was in perfect harmony with the spirit of the day.  The tables at dinner were loaded with good things, and at each man's place there was a small card bearing the inscription - "The Australian Branch of the British Red Cross wishes you a merry Xmas, a happy New Year and a speedy recovery." 
 Major Norton, Officer Commanding, spoke a few words, wished the men the season's greetings and every happiness and good cheer.  He said that nothing had pleased him more than to have had the opportunity of sleeping under the same roof with such a splendid lot of fellows.  "God save the King" was sung, the men drinking their King's health with orange ale, lemonade, and ginger beer. 
 4:1:16 - Discharged from Helouan with 150 others to Gizeh, via Bab-el-Louk.  Gizeh camp is on the banks of the Nile and composed of two sections - 1st and 2nd Australian Divisions respectively. 
  SPECIAL DUTY  12:1:16 to 4:2:16 - On the morning of the 12th a Special Guard was detailed for duty from Gizeh Camp.  The selection of the men had been carefully carried out and the exact nature of the duty ahead kept a profound secret.  I was chosen as one of the Corporals of the Guard and after much speculation as to our destination, eventually arrived at Cairo Station (our future Headquarters) and found that we were to picket the railway lines leading therefrom down to Fraz, a distance of about 3 miles from the Station.  A certain section of the natives, no doubt animated and prompted by German influence and money had become very restive and inclined to create disorder, and the Egyptian Authorities had received reliable intelligence that an organised attempt was to be made to destroy the various railway works, foment dissension and, if possible, mutiny amongst the railway employees.  The Australians had been called upon to save the situation, as they were considered to be the only troops capable of dealing with the troublesome natives, viz., by direct action and no quarter in the event of any disturbance.  The importance and responsibility of their job will be recognised when it is known that at Fraz, a huge railway siding, there were immense coal stacks and oil stores.  Then along the main line were the large electric power station, the many carriage sheds and workshops.  We had guards posted everywhere, and were all out to catch the wily and traitorous nigger.  I was first stationed at Fraz as Corporal of the night picket on the oil sheds.  It was very cold, but several Soudanese watchmen, who by the way seemed to have the full confidence of the Authorities and who were there to assist us in local
