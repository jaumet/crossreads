  
 September 1917 guns of all calibre and new ones are continually coming into position.   Many of the guns have been placed in their gunpits ready for action with an abundant supply of ammunition, but are as yet without gun's-crews (they are coming up later) 14th   We continued with our reconoisance this morning & had a narrow escape at "Hell-Fire Corner."   We did the tracks & communications to "Jargon" trench (present front line) on the left of the sector & also position of "dumps."   The 17th, 18th, 19th, & 20th London Country regiments are represented in this part of the line & are anxiously awaiting our chaps to relieve them.   The remainder of the company are building "Nissen-bow" huts about a mile further up the road.
