<p>13 September 1918 Friday (X to X crossed out)<br/>Jordan Valley    Returned to the exclusive area- X In evidence I found Desert Corps men alone spend between &pound;20 000 &amp; &pound;30 000 a month at AIF Canteens- mostly Tucker- X<br/>During my absence the underlings of our Staff have exercised their ingenuity by making us build <u>dummy</u> horses out of Bamboos &amp; Hessian to deceive  enemy aircraft!!!  On the road I passed many of Egyptian Labor Corps mending roads &amp; all singing their native love song Cum-Leyla Cum-Low, or something like it meaning How many days &amp; how many nights before I see my beloved again-</p>
