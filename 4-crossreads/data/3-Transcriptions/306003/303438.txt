<p>21-7-16<br/>Regt, a lad of the 2nd Regt was shot through the temple as he was about to mount to come back &amp; died within an hour or two;<br/>C. Squadron came back to Qatia about 8 oclock tonight &amp; soon afterwards we started for Romani;  Major Chambers of the 2nd L.H. took his Squadron to Bir-Es-Sagia today &amp; could see no sign of the Turks, &amp; we decided to water their horses there, &amp; did not put on a guard.</p>
<p>One of the lads later on had to leave the horses for a few minutes, &amp; only went a few yards when he saw 2 Battalions of Infantry crawling towards them on hands &amp; knees, he walked back to the horses &amp; gave the alarm, &amp; they had to run the gauntlet of the Turkish fire &amp; strange to say no one was hit.  As C Sqd was retiring tonight from Oghratina the Turks gave them two shots from an artillery gun, both shots fell short.  It was nearly midnight when we got back to Romani</p>
