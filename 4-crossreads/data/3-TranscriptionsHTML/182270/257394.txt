<p>Fine. Got away from the wharf</p>
<p>about 11.30 AM &amp; anchored out</p>
<p>in the Bay for an hour. Got way</p>
<p>on at 1 pm &amp; steamed out in a</p>
<p>very thick mist. All the diggers</p>
<p>turned up except one; and I</p>
<p>think one officer.</p>
<p>The sea is as calm as a mill</p>
<p>pond.</p>
