Dear J. I hope that you received my cable safely, it should have left on the 5th of Inst I have done very little writing since I came here as it makes my arm ache after I have been at it for awhile, I can only write very slowly but in a couple of weeks things will be very different, as the wound is healing up nicely of course it will be some time before I will be back with the boys as the muscle will be stiff for awhile, The rotten part of the business is that I had a return of a sort of fever which I had an attack of when in the trenches in June my temperature was normal and when the fever came on jumped to 103.6. the nurses thought that I was up to some joke so took my temp. again and found that I was not. next morning I was still feverish so had to stay in bed. I had a good rest certainly but yesterday was the first day that I was allowed up for a fortnight I have been trussed up like an Invalid
