very evenly matched there was no sense of them both disfiguring themselves at this stage of the game
this squabble can be put down to the disappointment of being quarantined for everyone is in a very bad humour only too ready for a row, in fact it would almost be welcomed as a means of letting off pent up steam
The Drs came aboard this afternoon again took our temperatures, in addition to this we have to go through fumigating, they have rigged up 2 small rooms holding about 50 men at a time each batch gets a good 10 minutes steaming with hot steam chemicals, what a farce this is for we are as clean as can be, they reckon we have to go through this 3 times that most likely we will proceed to the pier early on Monday morning
