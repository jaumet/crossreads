 Aug 4th Have been three day now at Gam , about four mile south east of Sheik 's heran Railway station . I am feel veri happi over my work here . I have alway love hors , and the chanc of work among them , and I have it here . I am pursu by a dread that they will tri to put me into the Tent Divis , but am determin not to leav the line without a struggl . I am with the bearer now , and ought now to see some work to my tast . Of cours , I know , there is alway the possibl that after my first scrap , I may never want to see anoth , the same as mani other have been befor me . Here I have had one day graze , the hors are taken out , each man ride one , and lead two , about three mile to water , and then anoth mile and a half further on , are turn out to graze , be mind , of cours , all day . There is some good pick here , the old crop ( barley ) left by the Turk be plenti , though all lie down on the ground . The hors enjoy the freedom from the line , and get a great tuck in into the bargain . But what a dusti track . Some month
