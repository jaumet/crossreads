 June 7 188. At 7.30 this morning a coup by the 5th Btn.  At 7.30 Corp. Schwab and another chap went out and surprised two Boche who had repaired to a quiet spot by their post for a rest, they were quietly awakened, and brought in, then followed the close sequel.  Serg. Thompson with two others on information received from the two prisoners, went out, surprised a post of 9 men:  they surrendered themselves and their L.M.G. and passively followed to our trench. 
 Must watch for their individual Patrol reports that will be in tomorrow.
