<p>made a tent out of trench covers, we carry it about with us and erect it each night.  Move forward again tomorrow.  The 1st Division, relieving the 3rd, and the 2nd Division the 5th.  We are on the road to Peronne, although our troops are well in advance of that town.  Saw a number of Frenchmans graves, men who fell in 1916.  These graves were dug up and the bones strewn about.  Presumed that they were dug up by Germans.  A large number of the enemies captured guns about here.  A lot of shooting with service rifles on the banks of a lagoon, one man on opposite side shot in abdomen, and several horses wounded.  A dirty Hun trick was worked off on some of our burying party.  It appear that a party of our people were detailed to burry the dead, they saw a dead Hun on a stretcher, ready for burrial, they naturally went to carry him away;  Both were blown to pieces, the stretcher was attached to a bomb.</p>
