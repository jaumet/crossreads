kept our heads down. I got a whack on the back from about a pound of dirt, and thought a shell had got me. However, for some reason, none chose to fall amongst our small group, and after about half an hour it died down. We all felt relieved, and kept a sharp look out, but Fritz did not follow up. On reporting "all correct" to the 2nd Battalion on our right later on, we learnt that they had suffered some casualties.
