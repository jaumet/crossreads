<p>Leave Boats and Hospital Ships there steamed our escort of wicked looking torpedo boats, while sea-planes too took the air for they are the best detectors of the wily submarine; once too, we saw quite closely one of our &quot;Silver Queens&quot; a bright, shining beauty of an airship patrolling the coast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the landing, train for London and a beautiful run through Kent looking very pretty, fields red with clover and yellow with buttercups, and woods with a carpet of blue hyacinth, and a little further on alight with the mauve of banks of rhodendron.&nbsp; It was glorious, and so welcome too, for &#39;twas England, our parents&#39; homeland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our party of five M.C&#39;S, Capt.Lambden (37TH) Lieuts.Suter (40th) Todd (37th) McDonald (37th) and myself (38th) thereupon dispersed to our hotels.&nbsp; [Tcu?] of us went to the Y.M.C.A. Hostel for Officers, but not being able to get in there were recommended to 14 Belgrave Square, a fine old house that the Y.M. had taken over and fitted up as an Officers&#39; Hostel.&nbsp; Yes, comfortably installed in London seventeen hours after leaving the front and all I wanted then was a long, long sleep, for during the preceding seven days I had rarely had more than three hours sleep per night, so busy and bothered had I been with the last raid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we found that the King could not invest officers on the day for which we had come, so the necessary permission to stay having been wired us from France I immed-iately set off to Plymouth to spend the week-end with my Devonshire relatives, announcing my arrival by a wire sent from the train.</p>
