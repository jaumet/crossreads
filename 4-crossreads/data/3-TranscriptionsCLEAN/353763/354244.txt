  
 You see it's the exact sciences - the physical sciences that flourish & bloom in the navy  -  - the inorganic as against ours the organic side of life - Mathematics, mechanics, physics preponderate immensely  -  The doctor rarely gets a look in - he cant - there is not the opening so I say go for the exact sciences & join the Navy  -  It's a good game & I like the M.O.  -  limited though his knowledge is to his own job - outside that he's horribly ignorant  -  I left the Grantala after lunch & went back to the Upolu & from the Upolu to the Beach & my first job was the sending & registering my serial tale - the  4th  section to you  -  I also wrote Turner who has had a rotten time  -  He fell off a ladder & broke collar bone, ribs & shook himself up muchly & has been laid up   -  trained morse & all the rest of it  -  He's improving  -  Writes with his left hand  -  I then visited the local museum & library - both fair only - you know country town shows
