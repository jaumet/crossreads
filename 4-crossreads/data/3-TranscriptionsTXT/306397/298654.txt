 alter our course to Sumatra, and move away from the steamer. At about 5 oclock we resume our previous course. The steamer is in sight ahead . We soon recognise her as the "Pontoporus" We steer for her. At 8 oclock a Dutch torpedo boat is coming direct for us followed by the ship of the line "Hertog Heinviic" Both pass close. All the binoculars of the Dutch officers are directed on us. 
 After dipping the flag which is answered they pass us by the stern on which they search in vain for the name. The officers on the torpedo boat seem amused, perhaps because the name "Marckomania" seems familiar to them. We were outside the 3 miles limit. 
 "Pontoporus" comes along side us and coaling commences. In the course of the forenoon another Dutch cruiser and 1 torpedo boat passes nearby. In the afternoon we sight a 3rd cruiser, accompanied by an apparently empty collier.
