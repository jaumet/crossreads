 Weather as yesterday.  Beautiful but cold. Off Duty today.  We take the runs one day on then one day off Leave to Boulogne is allowed daily. Strolled up to a very small village to the east of the Boulogne Forest between Cremarest & Bellebrune after tea.  Black Watch are billeted in these villages. Saw Deer in the Forest Tonight we were helping to milk cows at the place above mentioned.  Had a fine humerous evening
