 1916 May 11 Thursday 
 Weigh anchor, &amp; depart from Alexandria at 10 a.m. Dense fog settled on harbour from sea just at sailing time. Steam slowly out on wake of S.S. Scotian which is to be our consort for voyage.  Sea as calm as proverbial lake. Fog lifted about mid-day. To bed early on deck. No lights visible, life belts issued to each man, ordered to wear them day &amp; sleep with them by night. Boat takes zig-zag course changing every 4 miles in order to dodge likely submarines. Strong guards &amp; look out posted all over ship.
