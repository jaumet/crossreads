<p>THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine. I was knocking round</p>
<p>with Alan all day. Al &amp; I took</p>
<p>two of the nurses from Lady</p>
<p>Carnarvon&#39;s hospital to dinner</p>
<p>&amp; then on to &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; after.</p>
<p>It was a jolly good show and</p>
<p>Dot Brunton was very good</p>
<p>indeed. We all went round</p>
<p>to Rector&#39;s after to a dance.</p>
