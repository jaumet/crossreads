24/4/17FavreuilA perfect day still. In the afternoon went out to our practice ground and carried out a two Brigade attack practice one of finest sights I think that I have ever seen. About 7000 men in waves as relentless as Fate sweeping across country with set intent. Rode along in rear & then attended a pow-wow at which the General was present. Just like a big field day at home both in the operation and the surroundings. We rode out through Sapignies which had been most systematically and thoroughly destroyed by the ruins. The Church is a high heap of rubble and nothing else fringed with a few still upright tombstones of grave and respectable burghers. Some Indians camped in here. The trees round have been chopped down and left lying. The men carried out today's exercise well and show how once they have a thing explained and discussed they can do it.
