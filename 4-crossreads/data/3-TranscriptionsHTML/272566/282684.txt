<p>Tuesday 23 October</p>
<p>Wet and dull weather.<br/>2 trips to A.D.M.S. Ypres  via Busseboom, Ouderdom &amp; Vlamertinghe on each occasion<br/>The roads today are very muddy making motor-cycling an unpleasant job.  I'm splashed from head to foot with mud to say nothing of the state of the bike<br/>Cards after tea.</p>
