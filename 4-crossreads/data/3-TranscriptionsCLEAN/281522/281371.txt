The Companies moved out to their work - "A" to the musketry range and the balance to the adjoining grassy slopes for section and company drill. General Smythe rode up with a lancer to inspect our horses and had nothing fresh to say. Furphey of a great many troops going up forward through the villages adjoining. During the afternoon visited the General & found the man of blood immersed in a study of a swallow with a nest full of young ones. Saw Duggan and arranged the attaching of Gawler to the 21st Battalion, first telling that young person exactly my opinion of him. Also today had the pleasure of doing the same with Miles. At 8.30 p.m. we moved out to a night stunt and it worked well. General Gellibrand was out and told me of my promotion to Lieut Colonel. The men very keen on their work. One had charge of a "prisoner" who attempted to escape. He put a bullet after him. Sent the firer in to one guard under arrest.
