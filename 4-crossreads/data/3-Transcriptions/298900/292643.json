<p>Friday 1st March<br/>    Spent a good night taking everything into consideration.   Up early &amp; took over at 7 A.M.    Found plenty to do as there were 123 patients serious &amp; otherwise &amp; Baths, treatment, disinfecting &amp; a dozen other sidelines had to be fixed up.   However had all square by about 10 A.M. &amp; by night had everything running perfectly.   Rigged up my bunk in the dispensary at night as I still have to watch over that.</p>
<p>Saturday 2nd March<br/>    Bitterly cold day, the coldest this winter I think as a wind was blowing at the same time.   Everything going on smoothly at the Hospital, M.O.'s &amp; men satisfied which is a good sign.  Made a few alterations during the day &amp; drafted ward rules at night so that matters should be perfect tomorrow.  Had a bath before tea &amp; it was a real treat to get under a warm shower.   Heavy bombardment last night, brought on</p>
