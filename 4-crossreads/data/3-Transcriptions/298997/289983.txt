<p>Dec 26th<br/>We had quite a fine Christmas, but it opened badly.  Weather is very cold, and the ice on one of the ponds in our camp was frozen hard.  A lot of the boys made a slide &amp; were enjoying them selves when a Fritz 'plane came over.  Some of the boys did not take cover, and there was a crash &amp; a squeal suddenly.  What had happened was that an anti-aircraft "dud" dropping, had landed right in the pond, cracked the ice, &amp; cause two casualties with flying ice-pieces.  The argument is now whether the men will be charged with S.I.W..  Charges for self inflicted wounds are very frequent now - &amp; the wounds need not be willfully self inflicted.  These men might suffer for failing to obey an order to "take cover"</p>
