<p>10th  The boys are all improving and as they are better they are sent to Montazah at Alex &ndash; for a fortnight before rejoining their regiment.</p>
<p>11th  Tis the little Elisenas' birthday.</p>
<p>12th  Our Ward closed down this am &amp; the boys that were left were sent to Sister Rush's ward.  It wasn't a bit nice  Saying good bye to them.</p>
<p>13th  I am off duty for a week unless something unforeseen happens.  So am getting my things in readiness in case of a hurred departure &amp; so as any spare time can be given to saying farewell to the places we have learnt to love in Egypt.</p>
<p>Last night a small party of us took our tea &amp; went out to the pyramids.  I've never see the Sphinx &amp; pyramids (the largest covers 13 acres of ground &amp; the stones that comprise it would build a wall of 4ft high &amp; one wide all around France) that give you an idea of its size, &amp; its height is 451 feet.  The next to it is 447 feet high.  Then theres the Sphinx very mutilated now but it impresses you with its great strength &amp; has a wonderful power of mystery.  How they all stood out in the light of the setting sun &ndash; soon we look behind &amp; theres the full moon peeping up &amp; its rays over the Nile &amp; the citadel &amp; the grey hills behind are very beautiful.  I feel as if it was a good bye visit but it couldn't</p>
