November 16, 17128.After a wash this morning, back in the Billet.  Clarrie and self over to Q.M's for boots we put in for yesterday during foot inspec.  In a corner of the store, we were told we'd find a bag of boots, get a pair from those...  all were salvage - and old unmatching pairs....
Such is the issue manner of the 1st Field. .. If it wasn't for our own salvaging the unit would be worse than the most tattered Boche prisoner after his capture in the deep mud.
After 10 parade - with Frank D., out down the valley with sketch books.  Frank sketched a fine little winding road and a cluster of farmhouses.  I grouted more apples than were good for us.
Mail this morning, "Philip the King", "Lily of Malud" and "Twelve Poems" from Beaumonts, with a most courteous apology for their delay.
Now for a reading, in the O.R. by a good wood fire.
Tomorrow for the road again...

In our Billet with the Bearers a great roaring fire- and a yarning [indecipherable] about it... down in the cold vaulted dairy cellar, the A. Tent Section....
A great and enjoyed route march this morning - a compleat circle about the Billet... past the wounderful wood - flaming rioting colour, inspired in Johnny the memory of Zig-Zag, and a clear flat platitude from the 'living corpse', "The triumph of vulgarity!"
