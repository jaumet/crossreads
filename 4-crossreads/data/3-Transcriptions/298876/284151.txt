<p>must be for some special purpose.</p>
<p>Had a squd of men out drilling part of the day. They take things very quietly here.</p>
<p>Friday<br/>10/3/16</p>
<p>Quite cool all day &ndash; Revalie at 6 am get on Parade at 6.30. Have a bit of a march till 7.30. Often go across to the ostrich Farms quite close to the Camp. Have had a Fatigue Party all day.<br/>Great Sensation in Cairo yesterday. An Australian was observed saluting an Officer. Another 17 A.M.C. men came in at 3 am from S. Australia. This is my opinion of Australians &ndash; They are seen &amp; heard at every corner of Cairo &ndash; in fact Australians predominate  in the life here today &ndash; They take up all the footpath &amp; most of the road. They smile at &amp; make love to most women &ndash; always courteous to aged. The Donkeys &amp; camels will never forget the Australian invasion, for they poke them with their canes &amp;</p>
