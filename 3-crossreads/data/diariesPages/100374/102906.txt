home loving instinct must be in the people that they should remain so near the danger zone, never knowing the minute that "Fritz" may be successful in breaking through with all his atrocities following in his train.

Walked out the Le Petit Bois (The little Wood).

May 14th. Sun.
Walked out to Sailly-Sur-Lys. This is a land of small holdings. Many of the farmhouses are thatched-roofed and others are red tiled.

These farmhouses look exceedingly picturesque. The red tile or thatch peeping above the trees surrounding it longs  looks splendid from a distance, but when one gets near to them all the enchantment vanishes and a very crude dirty tumble down place meets the eye.

Inset in small niches outside these farmhouses are little statuettes either of the Virgin Mary or some other favourite saint. The people are Roman Catholic in their religious beliefs.

The women and girls of this village have very big feet. They are also turned in at the ankles in a very peculiar fashion. I sometimes think that it is owing to having to walk over the irregular cobble stones in the streets and foot paths.

The people have got to carry their household water from the village pump. This must have a very deteriorating effect on their figure.

The Y.M. which is in the Town Hall (Hotel de Ville) in the village square, seems to me to be a dead and alive kind of place.
