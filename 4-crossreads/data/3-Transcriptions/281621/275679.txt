<p>Monday 1<br/>At Bernefay at A.I.S. The weather is still wet and dull and in no wise different from that which we have been having all along lately.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2<br/>Today I was warned to go on leave on 27th inst. Saw George Wilkie this afternoon, he is camped over the road.</p>
<p>Wednesday 3<br/>I with a few others move back to the unit at Buire which is just as desolate as ever</p>
<p>Thursday 4<br/>Tonight a party of us went to see the "Shrapnel" at Merricourt and enjoyed a very good variety show.</p>
<p>Friday 5<br/>Still at Buire where the weather lately has been fine and nice. I notice some shelling on a hill a couple of miles away but I have no idea whether it is our practice or Fritz.</p>
