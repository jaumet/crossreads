<p>5<br/>Sunday 24th Jan. Very quiet in camp today nearly everybody either out or asleep in the sun. Major Bill has gone out for an all day camel ride. The same Major Bill is keeping first rate and is thoroughly enjoying life. Treats us first rate. All the other friends are well Richards, Toomey, Eric Lenehan, Major Rabett, etc etc. I have seen a good deal of Reg &amp; Maurice Ferguson since I came over here. Reg is keen on a transfer to the 1st Light Horse, so I have given him a letter to a Friend of mine in A Squadron, Lieut A A White (married Nurse Nobbs of the North Shore Hospital) to see what he can do for him. Young Ferguson is a very smart boy, and the 3rd Battery Officers think a lot of him.<br/>Richards, Toomey &amp; self have purchased a camera so I will have some snaps to send you by next letter.<br/>Had bad luck with my old horse. He developed pneumonia on board ship and died about a week after landing. However, I have a splendid mare now, will send a photo later. She is very docile but strongly objects to having anything to do with camels.<br/>I don't know whether I have received all your letters yet. There were none till 14 days ago when I got a number in one lot, 2 from Mum, and 3 from Father. I was very sorry to hear about Sis, but trust she is quite well</p>
