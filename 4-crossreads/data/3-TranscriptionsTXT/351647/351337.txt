 Brian Mac who looks well &amp; is doing OK work.  I still knock round the country lots (mostly bike these days) &amp; see my numerous friends &amp; acquaintances.  They hail from all over Australia so I'll have to behave myself when I get back. 
 My dear here's a nice large shell coming, no its a 'dud', thank heaven, not that I'm in any danger but it might have killed someone if it hadn't been. 
 Have also witnessed a thrilling air episode &amp; yet its a quiet day. 
 Had a thunderstorm last night, my tent leaked so I had to arise &amp; don a water proof &amp; cover the bed with another &amp; sit &amp; smoke till the storm passed away.  Today I have had a large wash, all my spare clothes &amp; they needed it.  I'd like to wash blankets but its such a job &amp; water scarce &amp; hard to get &amp; a long way to carry it.
