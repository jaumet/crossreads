  
 2/5/17 Favreuil & Vaulx 7pm  Battalion moved off in waves in column of fours with 50ft between half waves and 100ft between companies. The men carried 6 bombs each & 4 sandbags, 2 of the latter being round the legs. The 24th crossed our line of march in column of route with their band. Halted at Vaulx until the twilight deepened. The enemy put up a fairly stiff barrage on the Longatte Road - shrapnel mostly. The waves picked up their guns (which had been transported ahead) and all their wire mats, carrier's bombs etc at the gully near aeroplane Hill. 9pm  my men left them here & marching on the map in the moonlight found the 186th & 185 Bde H.Q. at L'homme Mort staying with the latter people. About 11pm. 10 tanks passed slowly up along a tape & made the same noise only as a motor, silencers being used. Dreadful uncanny looking things sliding along over all obstacles. The Hun puts some heavy stuff round here continuously. Having reported to B.H.Q. by phone turned in. the runners "dug in" to a bank
