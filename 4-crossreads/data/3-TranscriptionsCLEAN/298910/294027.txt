 Very cold last night - 15th F. Ambulance & Dr Coppleson done good work last night. Most of the bearing has to be done under darkness & difficultys, as long as we get them into the dressing station, we can evacuate them during the day, we only hold men here who will be fit for service again in five days - 128 shells were dropped into Lavinte yesterday & the only damage was Batterys nil - 1 cow & calf injured, two Farm houses blown down & burnt - I could have got plenty of souvenirs - but a man would soon want a horse to carry them. 
 12/7/16  Wednesday 
 Raw cold sort of day - Very busy all night & day - The 57th Battallion are getting hell in the trenches. It's hard to see our lads & lots that we know, coming in at mid
