 Tuesday 4 December 1917. 
 Got to our position at  2 pm  2 am. 
 Casualties as result of our raid arriving at ambulance. 40 wounded &amp; 2 killed out of 120 Officers N.C.O&#39;s &amp; men. Raid not too successful. 
 Shelled again today. 1 camel killed in our unit. 6 from other units. 
 Word of being relieved tonight or in early morning. A certain plan adopted to evade suspicion from enemy observation posts. Successful. 
 At midnight the NZ&#39;s relieved us &amp; Jacko apparently knew nothing of this as not a shell was fired.
