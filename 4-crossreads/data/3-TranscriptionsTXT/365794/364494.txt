Tuesday 3 [2] April 1917 [1918]A day of sorrow & not to be dwelt upon.  Principal items - large dose of castor oil given in pure brandy, the latter burns my throat so badly that a vomiting episode results, finally a No. 13 pill & Cal. [Calomel] gr. iii are swallowed with endless trouble with B.P. [bed pan ?] & bell-ringing etc., results no notice is taken of a bell until ring 5 or 6 times & I feel so miserable that the night is one long nightmare.Thirst! where shall I secure enough of the old Nile to be satisfied, I wonder?Visited 10 a.m. by O.C. & very businesslike he is.  Throat & tongue inspection take place.
