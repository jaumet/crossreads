<p>Gallipoli<br/>15th Nov 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father,<br/>Another mail arrived today bringing another batch of letters &amp; papers. The English papers you are sending arrive regularly &amp; are eagerly devoured, first by myself &amp; then by the other officers of the battalion, where they land up I can't say. The Australian papers are also a boon, &amp; it is very interesting to read the straight forward accurate accounts of events by Capt Bean, &amp; then compare them <strike>[indecipherable]</strike> with the absolute piffle imagined by a man called Bartlett. Whether he has ever been on this peninsular or not, of course I can't say, but judging by his writing I would be quite prepared to doubt it. We have just moved from our old position &amp; are all very disappointed, as we had just connected up with the Turks underground. When we wanted a bit of excitement we used to enter the tunnel &amp; have a bit of a revolver duel with the foe. We were gradually driving him back by building up sandbags &amp; gradually pushing them forward. As long as nothing but <strike>sa</strike> bullets were used it was good sport <strike>wh</strike> but when they started bombs it was not so funny. One or two officers were laid out by the concussion &amp; jabs, but recovered. The whole of the work was done by officers. We were just expecting to get at them when we were moved.<br/>Your Affectionate son<br/><u>Arthur</u></p>
