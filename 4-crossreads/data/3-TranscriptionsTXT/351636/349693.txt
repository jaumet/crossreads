 Dear Mr. Layton We should be glad if you would investigate the case of Mrs. O'Connor Haldon St. Lakemba who is rather badly in debt. Her son is in camp &amp; apparently allowing her only 10/- p week out of his pay &ndash; she is owing in rent &amp; has received notice to quit unless paid. 
 Yours faithfully B. Booth.
