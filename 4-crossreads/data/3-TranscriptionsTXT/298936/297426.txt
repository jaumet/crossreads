 + Gallipoli 
 September 1915 
 Monday 27 Once more we rose at 5 a.m. &amp; got off at 7.30. Easier walking minus black kit bag &amp; blankets, which I found intact on arriving at jetty &ndash; found some hot water on a boat &amp; made some coffee. Sailed by the "Partridge" ( an auxiliary gunboat originally a was channel steamer) for Anzac at 5p.m. 
 At 7 p.m. saw flash of big guns in the distance as we hugged the shore. 
 At 8 p.m. drew up opposite  Anzac Cove ( where the first landing took place). Saw [indecipherable] bombardment by a destroyer &amp; heard firing in distance landed &amp; bombed by German aeroplane &ndash; no casualties.
