I have not the cash to start a daylight robberi busi therefor a chick would have been no use to me . The is a tree grow here known as the curlyw which may interest Betti it is a tree which is half a vine and it climb about on itself in a most remark manner it long spray be just the same as those of a vine have grip where with to hold on with . The first growth trunk of the tree vine can grow straight up unless it happen to be near anoth tree , when it is strong enough shoot come grow from the root wind round the parent trunk . I have seen great twist mass of these tree here in the leas . the wood when dead is harder than iron bark and polish nice . it is brown . it is also veri tough make nice whiphandl . I have got a piec here now which is almost as hard as eboni . I must stop now with a cheer for King Georg merri England . if necessari I ll fight like wild cat for him his littl island .
