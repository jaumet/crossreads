<p>with a message on foot, and after having lots of lucky escapes I arrived there safely. I gave General Gellibrand the message and he also asked me what I observed personally when up in the advanced position. I told him where we reached and to where we retired to a settled line, by the aid of maps. <br/>He told me not to go back to the post I came from as he wanted me to be a runner for him as his staff of runners was evidently lost early in the "stunt". I had not been in the job long when I was required to go up to the front trench again and find an officer to whom I had to deliver a message, and when I had searched for him for another hour in vain, I learnt that he was wounded and stranded in a shell-hole in no-man's land. When he was out of action a Sergeant Major advised me to take the message to another officer, and when I had done this I hurried back as quickly as possible as the place was by no means safe. <br/>In the vicinity of Headquarters where I was stationed, we were shelled very heavily by the Germans and the sights that were to be seen on wounded and killed men, were something awful, sometimes men were killed outright, sometimes buried under the heaved up earth, and sometimes they were wounded so badly that one was afraid to touch them in case one would aggravate their pain. <br/>From the commanding position we were in we could see some terrible hand to hand encounters between the New South Wales brigade and the Germans, and these encounters were kept up continuously for hours, reinforcements coming to the assistance and replacing the dead and wounded on both sides.

After I had been on  my post about 10 minutes a big shell got 2 lieutenants and left them in a pulp  on the ground.
