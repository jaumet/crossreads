<p>Thursday. August 19th. 1915<br/>Dear Nell,<br/>I enlisted today and I have bought this book to make a diary, during the time I am away at the front.<br/>I hope to get away soon for I am going into camp straight away, so I intend to start it off the day I sail, so that, from that day on you will have an account of what I did in the Great War.<br/>Your loving Brother<br/>Harry</p>
