 Thursday 3rd 
 Great news we hear that the Turks have approached in great strength and have taken Katia and Oghratina, but this may be only a trap, my old brigade had done great work. 
 Friday 4th 
 I have seven men in hospital all bad, rec orders that a squadron had to proceed to an unknown destination during the day, well I was awfully keen on it and paraded to Col McIntosh for permission to go. The Dr was away visiting outposts he returned just in time to see me saddle the mare. 
 He was disgusted at missing his chance, laughinly said I had stolen a march on him. The squadron was a composite one 170 strong, under our best officer Maj Don Cameron, we left camp at five pm in open formation, we moved off at a great pace, the going was very heavy, the sand in places up to the horses knees, we had three short stops and finally watered at railhead Ferry Post 6 miles from Ishmallia, we unsaddled and put our horses in a stable lately used by the London "Roughriders" (They are very rough) we had journeyed 12 miles in 3&frac34; hours, a great march. 
 The mare went beautifully, we fed up and lay down in our blankets expecting a sudden move through the night. 
 Saturday 5th 
 Not going today so fed our horses well, and camped. News came through that the 1st and 2nd LH Bde had got behind the enemy and taken 400 prisoners, we were delighted but hope we will get a smack at them to-morrow, made ourselves comf for night.
