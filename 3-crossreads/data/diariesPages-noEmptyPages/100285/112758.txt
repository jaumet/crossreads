Continuation of diary by Archie A. Barwick.
20th This book opens at Harborne Hall I am sitting at my favourite window surveying the countryside for it is a very nice morning the sun is trying to break through the screen of clouds, I am going away this morning to "Harefield" but I don't expect to be there long for I am practically all right now feel as fit as a fiddle.
Left the Hall this morning at 11.30 in motors which took us to Snow Hill railway station, here they dropped the whole party never even told us where we were going nor did they leave
