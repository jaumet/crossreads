Dear Mother
We are still jigging along here alright but have not had our leave yet, the company go tomorrow morning but Ken, Corp. Hosier & myself are in this advanced squad & are on the range this week doing our musketry course but with a bit of luck we ought to get on leave next week.  Yesterday we started at the range & it was a rotten day, wet & windy, today was not much better but less windy.  I have been scoring pretty fair but the rifle I have is not too good which is a drawback but with a bit of luck I might score something like a marksman although I don't expect any such luck.  The range is about 1/2 mile away & we have to come back for dinner so it amounts to a bit of a route march we do every day going & coming.  We had a change in our daily routine today & a very acceptable one too, reveille does not go till 7 a.m. now so we have an extra hour in bed of a morning.
