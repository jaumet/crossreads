<p>31/12/17 New Year's Eve. Kortepyp<br/>All available men moved out under Matthews to Ploegsteert wood to salvage and did good work there. I remained in camp and combed out any who were left in. The snow is still on the ground but is frozen into slippery snow ice. Our N.C.O's school has been held in-doors and consequently the work is monotonous. Until the ground is dry enough for drilling the school will be discontinued. At 10.30 carried out an inspection of the whole camp and notice that the fumes of the braziers have affected the rifles and dulled the metal work. Use of covers will nullify this. Our doctor [blotted out] is inclined to be too easy with the sick and the result is that we have three times as many off duty as the people next door. Roused the doctor up about this. The cooks as usual are amusing and extraordinary people. At noon</p>
