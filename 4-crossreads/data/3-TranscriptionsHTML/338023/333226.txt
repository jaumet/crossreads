<p>a front of many miles &amp; the fish were retreating in close order with some panic, same direction as ourselves. Later we saw piggy's strategy at its best, for only a few miles further down we ran into another brigade of his pals going like blue blazes to cut off the retreating victims (?) A journalistic exageration permitted by circumstances. These fish must have been eating European newspapers flung out from ships &ndash; otherwise how do they get these tactical ideas? They certainly seem to work on some well organised plan, but how they keep a shoal on the surface in 4,000,000 feet of water beats all conjecture. A squadron of trained porp.s ought to be very useful in a minefield. We have also seen a few 'dolphins' &ndash; a very small caricature of the sea pig &ndash; playing about, but otherwise the sea about us is desolate enough. Now &amp; then a whale comes up on the horizon, sports, has a look around, sees our ark and promptly bolts for the S.P.  They say the whales have been so often mistaken for subs that time &amp; experience have taught them to shun the society of grey ships that sneak along the ocean's by-ways. Very probably the whale has also been eating news-papers. <u>Who knows? &ndash; not the censor</u><br/>As for ships &ndash; except in port at F. we have not sighted one since leaving Melbourne! We know there are plenty of keels hurrying E. &amp; W., but they don't come our way, although the wireless talks continuously like a state premier. You can show the message about the Ch Brothers to John &ndash;<br/>If you see [indecipherable] W tell her [indecipherable] keeping a look out for <u>'Bill's brothers &amp; will visit them shortly</u> (if I get a chance) &ndash; I don't know about Aunt Jane yet, but don't expect to have any luck in that direction for a long while.</p>

It's the little gime o' diddlembuck! I 'ides 'em an' you finds 'em!" first drew my attention.</p>
<p>Nov 2. Early this morning we passed a small school of whales, fairly close; They were variously identified by the spectators as whales, porpoises, dolphins, threshers, sharks &amp; seals. Reasons given for a few of them) whales never jump high in the water, Porpoises only are responsible for such capers &amp; are, also, the only "fish that  spouts." Its very funny to be in a hammock for an hour listening to the various arguments that crop up. If W.W. Jacobs were on this ship he'd get plenty material. We are finding things a bit monotonous now &amp; I expect that, by the time we are half through the monotony will be the main part of the show. There is ab-so-lutely  nothing to do but eat - &amp; when one's story that has to be confined to meal times. The reading matter has given out and we have no prospect of renewing the supply for weeks to come. I thought of trying to start a ship "paper" but could not raise sufficient enthusiasm  to go ahead. The Y M C A officer [indecipherable] lives on the quarterdeck &amp; we hardly know him except by his badges &ndash; therefore, as the only typewriter on board is in his quarters the 'paper' stunt is not likely to come off. A few days of roaring [indecipherable] storm weather would improve things. The indications at present are favorable in this respect.</p>
<p>[the pages of the letter have been saved in incorrect order and the following is saved as page 40]<br/>The sea is a sickly grey color &amp; a thin haze has settled about us; The sea birds have left us for several hours &amp; an oily groundswell is rising steadily as we go further west. By the way, during the last few hours we have seen several dead birds floating &ndash; a circ. which is said to indicate that some rough weather has passed their way.</p>
<p>Nov 5th The rough weather has not, so far, come our way &amp;,  apart from a few showers &amp; slightly colder winds, conditions continue ideal. A ship newspaper is to be started shortly &ndash; officially &ndash; and I'll try &amp; get you a copy as a souvenir,  if the rag proves worth while. Sports are still the rage &amp; we're having a fine time.</p>
<p>I'm glad I brought a good supply of the weed as under other circ's I should have been stuck for it. We only draw 1/- per day while on board &amp; that at stated intervals.</p>
