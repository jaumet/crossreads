<p>18 November 1914<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>Out at the usual hour &amp; am glad to be at sea again. Our turn at stables came round again &amp; we are glad to be under Bert again. The vessels had fog practice today the procedure is:- A barrel whitened on the end of a long rope is let off the end of the boat then the rear vessel steers by it then the vessels also blow their different calls on the siren at frequent intervals. Huge shoals of fish are to be seen in the water as it is very clear here also shoals of flying fish. The finals of the boxing started tonight &amp; Maty fought the Trumpeter. [indecipherable] was altogether to good for him for in the first round legboned him 3 times then in the second he knocked him out. The Trump took it well but was no hero. Drinkwater also was beaten through lack of knowledge. 200 bags of chaff have been thrown over board &amp; there is to be naval inquiry. Bed at 9.00.</p>
