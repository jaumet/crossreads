<p>December 1915<br/>Monday 6<br/>Dull. Heavy firing at Suvla Bay and Cape Helles.</p>
<p>Tuesday 7<br/>Fine day. Some chaps back today. Len Poupard who was badly wounded the first day has returned. Our trench works were a revelation to him as there were only bushes to be seen when we landed. The Navy is doing a tremendous amount of shooting from our waters. Received welcome letters from Matt and Clare</p>
