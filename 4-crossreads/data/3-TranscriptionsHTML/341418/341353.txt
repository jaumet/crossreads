<p>feeding to write a little more about this spot. Our Division the HM. is holding   <strike>of</strike> from   <strike>here </strike>  the sea to Tsmailiah: But I can of course only describe the  defences  or the actual way by which we came out. Having crossed the pontoon bridge over the Canal, imagine in front of you a fairly good limestone road on both sides of which are encamped battalion after battalion of infantry. This continues for perhaps, a mile and half, then, about half a mile after the last of the tents, we come to a system of trenches running as far as the  eye can see north &amp;</p>
