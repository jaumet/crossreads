<p>Got a shelling between 8 &amp;10 with shrapnel &amp; 11 inch.  Allen was wounded in the head.  There were no other casualties in our troop.  Went down to the beach in the afternoon.  There was a big swell.  The day was about the hottest we have yet got here.</p>
<p>Sunday 16th<br/>At noon our Squadron relieved A Company.  There was some rain in the morning.  The Turks started shelling about 1 oclock &amp; there was a vigorous artillery duel for a couple of hours.  Went down to the beach for [sand?] bags.  We got into an exposed position for a couple of hundred yards &amp; got roared on.  Was on fatigue at night for a couple of hours in the firing line.</p>
<p>Thursday 17th<br/>Weather fine &amp; clear again.  Went into the firing line at noon &amp; had a quiet time.  At night there were a good few bombs thrown but I think the Turks got the worst of it with the bombs.</p>
<p>Friday 18th<br/>We were relieved by C Troop at 6am.  Our artillery shelled the Turks trenches</p>
