<p>[23rd July 1917]<br/>23rd. Anniversary of "Pozeries" today, seems a long year to me &amp; one full of changes, about 10 days ago there was a great Memorial Service held on the actual battlefield of "Pozeries" each unit of the 1st Division sent about 30 men who actually fought there to represent the unit it was a great gathering &amp; very impressive I believe, General Birdwood &amp; his staff were there &amp; a fine service was held.<br/>What beats me as how they don't erect some permanent memorial at "Poseries' for theres no getting away from the fact that the taking &amp; holding of "Pozeries' was a wonderful feat, especially after the previous unsuccessful attacks by the British troops</p>
