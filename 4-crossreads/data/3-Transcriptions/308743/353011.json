<p>5 August 1915<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Still more troops landed &amp; equipment &amp; space is pretty limited now &amp; water is none too plentiful. A heavy engagement was going on all day at the Cape &amp; our arty has been pretty continuous here all day, preparations are going ahead rapidly for the dust up tomorrow night troops are to carry nothing but ammunition &amp; huge white patches are shown on the backs of the tunics &amp; on both arms. The Tommys carry a metal disc this is to enable our artillery to pick out our troops &amp; fire accordingly everything points to a big affair this time &amp; is anxiously awaited for by everyone ; expect to be out of hospital tomorrow. Mick sent away with sciatica, Hobbs called &amp; so did Fred &amp; gave me all the news. The Monitors have been keeping the reserves of the enemy busy with their accurate shooting &amp; the road itself is ruined</p>
