  
 Got a letter from Jacky Hayes this morning with some rotten news telling me that my old cobber & pal Jock Mackie had been badly wounded & had died before they could get him to hospital poor old Jock is buried somewhere round Hazebrouck & the soil that covers him is surely richer than ever it was before, for Jock was above all a soldier in every sense of the word & as true a chap as ever breathed it will be a long long time before Jocks old face & figure fade out of my mind, that's 2 of my best cobbers killed now Reg Duke & Jock & still I am left I often wonder why the bonza chaps are taken & such affairs as I left dosn't seem right, but I suppose a higher power than we poor mortals
