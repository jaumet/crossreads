<p>MAY &nbsp; TUESDAY 30 &nbsp; 1916</p>

<p>Fine &amp; warmer than it has been in weeks and very calm. I had my first lesson at signaling with the headquarters staff. I can send all right but find it very hard to read, but it will come with practice I suppose. There was a concert at night given by A.M.C fellows. I believe it was not up to much. I was not there. Bill Hunter &amp; Self had a hot water (fresh) bath in a bucket. It was great too.</p>
