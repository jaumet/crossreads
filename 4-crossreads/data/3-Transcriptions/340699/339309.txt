<p>dropping bombs round and Archies cracking. The 'planes passed over us flying very low, and if they hadn't evidently had some special object in view I don't see how they could have missed our camp, as the dark cloud had been blown away and the moon was shining brightly. They hung round for a long while and I think were after a camp of Yanks near-by. As they approached on their return journey to their lines I got up to have a look and lo! one was getting along not far above the trees. After he had got a bit away I saw a funny light on him and what looked like a shower of sparks come from him, but whether he was on fire or not I don't know. This morning I lay in bed till 12-30, it being Sunday and feeling not very well. After lunch Partis and Raphael, a Lieut, from South Africa who has, temporarily at least, taken Reid's place, got on horseback and rode to H. Q.

In a couple of days I'll be leaving here, and hope to get some of my sketches worked up. I think also that some other more purely War Records work will come my way. I've had no reply yet to letters that I've sent to others than you.</p>
<p>FRANCE, 30/7/17. [1918]<br/>I intimated to H.Q. that I would like to go back to-day and I am now waiting for a car. The wet has left us and to-day is quite hot, but hazy. Tomorrow, or the day after, we change our location, as I believe I told you, and I think there should be something there of interest. Everything is very quiet. This morning I heard the Tommy guns going, but they stopped suddenly and since then there's</p>
