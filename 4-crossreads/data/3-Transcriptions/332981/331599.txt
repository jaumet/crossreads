<p>over and I turned in for a sleep.</p>
<p>Saturday Feb 1st</p>
<p>I took over again at 9 am when the engine was in the Tachincourt Depot for coal, having left the train at Ligny. After waiting for a long time for the crane to load the coal on the engine, due to the water supply pipes for the crane boiler being frozen and it was necessary to blow steam down the pipes to melt the ice inside.</p>
<p>After we had our supply we came out and by degrees went back to Ligny for our train which in the meantime had left with another engine and we had to wait for the next in and it was just on 3 pm when we left with a long train of empties, and once away and through St Pol good head way was made to Montreiol where I was relieved at 7 pm and turned in after supper and slept until 3 am when we arrived at Calais and was instructed to take the train through Calais to Calais Maritime which is up amongst the docks.
