 This morning we went for a long march across the hills of this plateau, in a fresh breeze, until we came near to a village (La Motte) whose rugged silhouette had been noticeable on the way. We arrived at a semicircular chalk quarry where Bishop Long was waiting to address the 3rd Brigade on the Education Scheme of the A.I.F. He is the man who so impressed me by his personality, at Le Havre recently. His speech was good, for in it he gave us a clear idea of  how  the extent to which the promoters of the Scheme want it to grow. In short it is to bring the educational facilities from Australia to France for the purpose of giving the soldiers every chance. 
 It may be that by this scheme, I shall be able to get the chance to do a university
