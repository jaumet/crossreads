 Isn't this a pretty place? It is near where I spent my leave. You were a nice little daughter to send me those letters &amp; drawings and am glad to hear you went up to third class at Easter, you will be clever when I go back home. I am glad you &amp; Frank liked those letters &amp; cards I sent love from Dad
