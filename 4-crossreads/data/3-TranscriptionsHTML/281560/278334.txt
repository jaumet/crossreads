I really beleive that the<br/>regulation army shovel is winning the war. Was paid 20 Fr this evening, a very popular event. Will seek diversion; there is a train going out from Willow Siding presently; and I will be aboard and ride out to Dermacourt.<br/>17/12/16.<br/>Coming home from Dermacourt with one of the fellows last night</p>
