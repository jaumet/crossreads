<p>49<br/>At 6 Ortolan St off Square Monge They are awaiting. Dinner is specially prepared I think Soup &ndash; spaghetti &ndash; tomato salade &ndash; rabbit &ndash; potatoes in kidney &amp; gravy &ndash; [cheese] with cr&egrave;me &ndash; biscuits fancy &ndash; coffee &amp; wine (Graves).</p>
<p>After dinner I read some poems to improve my French &amp; amuse them by my imitation of Goyard &ndash; They seem to think it rather good. I copy some pieces out &amp; will learn them. She lends me her Larousse &amp; L'Archeologie Egyptienne, &amp; as I have a cold coming on she doctors me up with aspirin &amp; an infusion.</p>
<p>30-6-19<br/>Wrote up diary &amp; intended to go to bank but miss doing so. In afternoon I seek for [M. Chaqius secretariat de la Faculte de droit] but being unable to read Prof Truchi writing find myself in Rue Ponthien instead of Place<br/>Pontheon</p>

<p>Metro here have no seats in some carriages &amp; very few in the others. Each train of 5 carriages contains 1 1st class car &amp; as I am not a Frenchman ie I give my seat to any lady &amp; will not seat myself so long as a lady is standing I generally stand &amp; as often as not stand 2nd class for my boots are as comfortable in 2nd class as in 1st</p>
