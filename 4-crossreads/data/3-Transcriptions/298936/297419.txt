<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Monday 20</p>
<p>Still anchored out in the harbour.</p>
<p>Medical inspection at 10.30 at which I assisted the doctor.</p>
<p>Royal George crammed with troops arrived in the afternoon.</p>
<p>After tea received instructions to proceed to Anzac at 12 tomorrow.</p>
<p>Everyone excited to a mild degree &amp; plenty of chaff going the rounds.</p>
<p>Had a good yarn on a variety of topics with a [indecipherable] man well read &amp; interesting. Comes from near Birkenhead.</p>
<p>Wish I had met him earlier.</p>
