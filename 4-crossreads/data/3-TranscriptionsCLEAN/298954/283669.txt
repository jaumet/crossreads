  
 Sat. 6th July The Jap. purser was buried.   The Japs carried a banner before the coffin, each bowed to the corpse, placed a garland of flowers before the open grave & the banner was later placed on the mound.   Some 30 English present at the funeral. 
 Sun. 14th July My first  real  letters, 3 from Sydney & 1 from dear old Norm. 
 I slipped 'em in my pocket, did not open them till I was right away by myself over near the bridge & then, after reading them, had moments of deep emotional self-pity varied by green intervals of envy of Norm., writing sympathetically from a flat at Maida Vale! 
 The Holy Trinity (our sobriquet among the scoffers) is in low water at present.   Parcels very scarce & we have done several periods on nothing but biscuits (dry) & black tea. 
 Sun. 21st July. In the wooden sabots & dilapidated rags in which we usually flop around Geo. & I had a photo taken by old Schroder, the town photographer who comes out here every Sunday to sell and take photos. 
 Sat. 27th July International concert with Nagle as conductor.   The Russian (from the Moscow Opera House) has gone.
