 Reported British advancing all along the Line in several places being back in the old positions evacuated in March. Beautiful weather & seas. Expect to be in Fremantle early in the morning. 
 1918 September 9 Monday Arrived Fremantle about 7.30 am. About 140 men were dropped here & the remainder were given Leave in the afternoon. Sgt Clark Brindley Rees & another Sgt & I went per motor to Perth where we spent a couple of hours. Perth appears to be a nice little City - also Fremantle. Had an enjoyable afternoon & got back to the Boat about 7. P.M.
