 1917 MAY 
 6 SUNDAY 
 Fine, but cool &amp; windy. There was 
 a church parade in morning 
 but I did not go. We had to 
 shift all our harness from 
 the stables to the harness 
 rooms &amp; it was inspected by 
 Lieut Waller. We had a half 
 holiday in afternoon &amp; were paid 
 in evening. We played the 
 &quot;Pommies&quot; soccer in evening 
 &amp; it was a draw.
