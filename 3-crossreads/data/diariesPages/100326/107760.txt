18/9/15 Artillery started at stand to an early hour and seemed to aim at "A" Co. A big shell case charged with gunpowder with a detonator was discharged into the section from a mortar but did no harm. Jack looked in and had a yarn. He is Corpl of a Garland machine.
10.45. Derrick Buckley blown right out of their dugout by a .75. Derrick badly hurt and will be away some time. Hughie cut about head and also went to hospital. Later It seems the shell was 8.7 and ripped through 3 feet of clay and 5 inches of hard planking before blowing them all head first out of the dugout. Sorry for them both and wish for a speedy recovery. Posted Curnow to the Coy. as temporarily in command, and told C.O. a Lieut. could run office this job if any more are blown out as I like the men so well. A lovely day beautiful warm sunshine just a good Australian spring day down on a busy rifle range with people shooting and bullets zip zip all the time. We are quite used to it now but at first could not distinguish between the impact of the bullet and the discharge of the rifle. The high velocity bullet landing makes a sound just like a rifle does when discharged only a little bit muffled. Bombs are going off alround they make a good boom. The hospital ships at night are a pretty sight they lie just off the land with every light going and electric signs out La Rouge Croix All warships keep away and they with their cargo of pain remain there undisturbed.
