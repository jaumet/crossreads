 They were particularly anxious to know how many torpedoes we carried and where we used to go at night time while in the sea of Marmora. 
 In the afternoon of the 2nd May we were served out with a Turkish sailors uniform each, a red fezz and towel and pair of sox.  The soldiers uniforms had to be returned but we were allowed to keep the overcoats.  In the evening a Turkish officer and two N.C.O's  came in with a French interpreter who had been captured on the Peninsula r  the day before.  He could speak English and Turkish fairly well, we were indeed pleased to see him as we could not ask for anything before this.  They took our names in full, also our Father's name in full, whether dead or alive.  What for remained a mystery.

 About 11 a.m. we were allowed out in the garden overlooking the harbour for an hours exercise.   This  It was a treat to be out in the sun after being cooped up in a badly lighted room.  In the evening we were shaved and had our hair practically shaved off after which we had the usual evening meal and lay down to sleep. 
 On the morning of the 4th we were taken out into the large parade ground and lined up against one of the big buildings to have our photograph taken.  Our officers were also brought out to be photographed with us.  We were taken with our fezzes off and a Turkish sentry either side of us,  we looked proper criminals with our hair cut so short.
