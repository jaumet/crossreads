in it. Wonder that I did not choke. The artillery of both sides was unusually active today.
1st October, 1916.
We have been receiving reinforcements lately; we need them to. Went up to the big mine crater near the Yser Canal. This is a "whopper" crater. Have an elaborate plan of defences to carry out here, so will be employed for a while in the crater. "Hinie" only strafes us with rifle grenades at times so with a bit of luck we will have a good time one thing is certain, that no damn Brigade Major will come fussing round here. The Yser Canal is a fine stretch of water here because of the lock that is in it just "inside" our line. It is not long since this same canal was red with blood. Returned home via "Thames Trench" and the "Bluff".
