<p>I regard it with mixed feelings First I am glad to be away from all responsibility and the worry of looking after men the training of men and "dry-nursing" them etc. The responsibilities of communications and the hundred and one little incidental worries and annoyances so common to army life, and the freedom from active service in the field. Complete immunity from those Reconnaissances , long forced soul-killing night marches. Those long dry hot thirsty day marches patrol duty, bomb scares, Fights in the desert etc. etc. The getting back to civilization to ones friends and relations and "in short" [as Mr Micawber says] living a life of silken ease. All very nice all very fine<br/>Now for the other side of the <strike>Question</strike>  Question.<br/>  The war is not over yet and it seems as though they are only now beginning to "shake things along" and every able bodied man is needed in the field. Reinforcements are not coming along as they should be &ndash; whaffor? Ships loads of men coming back who have been broken in the war. Casualties lists lengthening not shortening.</p>
