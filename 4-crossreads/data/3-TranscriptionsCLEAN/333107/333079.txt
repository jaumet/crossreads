Wed Oct 2. Muster Parade this morning, a Frenchman and two Tommies came round and tried to identify somebody, but they didn't manage it. A draft came in from Blighty this morning, and I saw Sgt Mathieson among them. I heard later that the Frenchman recognised the chap he was looking for down at the Infantry Base. It appears the the Digger went for a drive in the Frenchman's car. He gave a 5F note in payment. The Froggie pulled out his wallet to get change, and "Aussie" snatched it and ran away. It contained 90Fs.
Had quite a busy day in the Drying Room. Attended French class, but I'm afraid I'm too thick in the Head to learn much.
Thur 3. Fine day. The war news is still excellent, and I do believe that the war id drawing to an end.
Had another busy day in Drying Room. Got Paid yesterday, 40Fs. A Franc is getting more valuable every day now, which is a very good sign. A pound is only worth 26Fs now, before it was 27.25.
Bought some French Books tonight and a writing Pad. Attended concert at Y.M., a Frenchman on cello and Lady at Piano. Yank recited, very good.
Fri Oct 4. Nothing very exciting happened. Was pretty bust all day. After Tea went to Y.M. but as Madame did not turn up there was no French class. After I hunted round all the Canteens for Pen nibs and couldn't get any.
I commenced a Letter to M.S.
Sgt Mathieson came in and had a yarn.
Sat 5. Fairly busy day. "Matto" is warned for draft, so I guess he will be moving off tomorrow. The Camp is pretty full now. A big A.M.C. draft came in today, and they are 13 and 14 to a Tent, so "Bill" came and camped with me in the Drying Room.
Sun 6. War news continues good, Bulgaria boss "Slung in the Towel" and now Germany is squealing for Peace.
Went into City after Dinner. Raining. Cleared up later, and my coat became a nuisance. Had Tea at Y.M. with chap from Dentists. Bought souvenir for "Young Hook", also a number of Xmas Cards.
Had a sing song in Train coming back to Camp.
