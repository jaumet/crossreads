<p>March</p>
<p>5:  Party of 650 left Moascar at 9 p.m. for Kantara east, where we boarded "Port Sydney" at noon.  Aust. Flying corps on board, met Hassall who landed in Egypt on Dec. 16th last &amp; already returning.  Steamed out at 4 p.m. through Suez Canal.  Glad to be returning at last, &amp; shall be pleased when I see the old home &amp; people again.</p>
<p>6:  Anchored at Suez at 4 a.m. leaving again at 9 a.m.  Very clean boat &amp; excellent food; so far there is no cause for complaint, though the 20 officers on board have more deck space than the men.  Trp. Frost of 2nd Guns attempted suicide at 4 p.m., shooting himself in two places in the chest with a revolver</p>
