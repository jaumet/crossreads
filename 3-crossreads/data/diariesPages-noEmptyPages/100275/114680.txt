kept so long at the Base.
This morning a few of us went for a walk round the beach, got caught lovely in a sharp squall which sprang up suddenly from the South West, we took refuge in the sand dune's but got pretty well wet to the skin, the sandy beach is a favourite walk with us for it is very pretty the salt air is bonzer there are always plenty of "white horses" breaking round about the entrance.
Last night the M. P.'s made a raid caught everyone crossing the railway line without a pass they caught 2 of our chaps among them.
