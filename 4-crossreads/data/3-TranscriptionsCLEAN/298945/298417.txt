  
 There has been an epidemic of arguments in the B Tent sub lately, and without allowing for war time nerves, & war weariness the result has been pretty rough for me if not for my logic. It is all part of the game, & it is all experience. When a chap is in the right & knows it well, I think he should give up the idea of trying to reform even his immediate associates & keep his mouth shut. The more one lives, the stronger one feels & the more capable one feels of meeting general difficulties, the less is one able to meet real difficulties.
