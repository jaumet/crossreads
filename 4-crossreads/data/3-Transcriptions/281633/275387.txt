<p>23/6<br/>Very cold, Blowing like hell.  Rolling heavily, sea on Beam.  We were below Latitude 42 today.</p>
<p>24/6, Tues.<br/>The Captain received wireless instructions to proceed to Adelaide so we are making north again.  Sea smoother.  Day drill.</p>
<p>25th, Wed.<br/>Stopped owing to Engine trouble (3 hours).  Rolling tremendously in the heavy sea.  Blowing like hell.  Inoculated against "Flu" today.  Made the arm feel rather numb &amp; weak.</p>
<p>26/6, Thursday<br/>Capt. Lang gave a Lecture on aeroplanes, incidentally describing his own World's record flight on a D (or V) H9 fitted with a Napier Lion Engine.  This machine could have undoubtedly bombed Berlin.  Running well in Handicap Chess Tourney but withdrew.</p>
<p>27.6, Friday<br/>Declaration &amp; Inspection.</p>
<p>28.6, Sunday<br/>Woke up this morning in sight of land and in smooth water.  Crow-eaters greatly excited.  Anchored at Port Adelaide 1.20 P.M. waiting for medical inspection.  Temperatures taken by Health Officers.  Berthed at about 10.30 P.M.</p>
<p>Monday, 30th June<br/>Crow-eaters disembarked before 9.0 A.M., very few people about.  One Sammy Lunn or Lum made enough fuss for a few.  He is by way of being a Rhymester.  There is nothing to sea at Port Adelaide but the Railway Station &amp; a few shops.  We left there at 2.0 P.M.  Sammy howled out some complimentary remarks through his megaphone "you Bonzers", you Beauties, etc.</p>
