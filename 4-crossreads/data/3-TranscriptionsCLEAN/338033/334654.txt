We had the railway junction at Achet Le Gran leading to several parts of our front. The rails were soon connected up with Albert, relieving a lot of transports from the road to do work nearer the front Line. We were in the summer now and had good roads at our disposal making trench life a totally different thing.Fritz had blown up mine craters in the main roads but this was of little account for large fatigue parties
