 9/6/16 As all the boy were sober , they were more amiabl this morn . Except for my eye , there is noth to show for the initi ceremoni of last night . I did not expect to find booz in the reserv line ; but a few of we "reinfo" took our Platoon Sergeant ; Harri Parker , is his name and bought him lot of beer . Now everyth is all right . This compani has none of the " spit and polish " of the 14/3 ; all the fellow in it seem to drink and swear hard and the fact that we are " D" Compani ; of the " Incompar Fight Third , " goe to prove that they will fight like 14 devil . This even we march up to support in the " Fleurbaix " sector ; and made ourselv snug in a billet about 2 mile from the fire line . March in the rank of a fight Battalion has made this one of the proudest day of my life .
