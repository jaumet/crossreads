  
 3/8/17 Campagne   Very threatening still.  Sent the Coy route marching by different roads with full packs up for about 5 1/2 miles.  One chap collapsed with acute pleurisy and was brought in on a stretcher.  Inspected the billets with the doctor and found them very good and clean.  At "C"Coy. the doctor had a patient in Madame who lost her uterus some years ago & is consequently getting very fat.  another Madame was of course present at the time - a necessary thing for convention's sake.  Yarned in the kitchen to the very clean and proper daughter of the house who once visited Paris for four days. Arras is the summit of her conception of the hub of the universe.  The land here is heavy with wheat and all the other fruits of the earth .  In the afternoon coys. carried on with specialist training.  Went down in heavy rain to Bde H.Q. and saw General Paton on several matters.  This village (Wardrecques) is much the same as our own - trim hedges, thatched houses, lovely trees and a church in the centre of everything.  Our band is going well at present and helps to while away the time.
