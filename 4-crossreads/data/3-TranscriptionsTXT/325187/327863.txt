 Court again.  These Sikhs have a conspiracy of Silence, &amp; it is a slow biz dragging out evidence.  I rewrite all the evidence every night 2 hours work. I found tonight what can be found in many wealthy Eastern houses- An old English Governess who had been for  30  years in Egypt  She told many things about the rotteness of the Rich Pasha's homes, &amp; the way in which they endeavoured to Copy the English being the sincerest form of Flattery. Truth, Honesty-Morality are sadly lacking in Egypt &amp; they are quite unfitted to govern themselves.
