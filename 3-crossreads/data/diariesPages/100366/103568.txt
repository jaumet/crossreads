 
There was some excitement this morning owing to a couple of German machines paying their compliments to us. We were all disturbed by unusual heavy "Airgun" firing & on going to have a look , saw several Fokkers observing our positions. A shell got very close to one & in retaliation he immediately dropped a bomb. This came hissing through the air & seemed to be on top of us for the time, It finally landed in the village about 150 yards from us. I do not know the damage, just after this we began to hear bullets hissing downwards, one striking the ground about 16 yards from me. These were the spent bullets from our shrapnel shells & decided me to take cover which I did.

About half an hour later we sighted one of them coming back for dear life surrounded by 5 of ours & could hear them firing their machine guns at him. They finally got him over Poperinghe where he fell. The other one was supposed to have been caught by shell fire at Armentieres.

27.9.16 & 28.9.16

It is again raining off & on. These two days have been the most exciting I have yet had, as I had to visit the Front Line trenches & all communication trenches to inspect various food dug outs & their contents. Starting away from Reninghelst at 9.00
