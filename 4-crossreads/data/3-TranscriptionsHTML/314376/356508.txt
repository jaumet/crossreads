<p>197<br/>Rheinhard by name, belonging I think to the 25th Battn, was very badly wounded &ndash; eyes, hands, legs. We put him on to the stretcher, he was only a feather weight, and carried him along quite easily. He chatted very cheerily and his only request was for a cigarette. Part of our way lay along a communication sap, one part of which was much exposed and shelled.</p>
<p>It was such a time [?] when we passed. There was room for us to set down under cover but no room for the stretcher with Rheinhard.</p>
<p>He said leave me on top and go into the trench yourself, I only wanting a cigarette. We did all we</p>
