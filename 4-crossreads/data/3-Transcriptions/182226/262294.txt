<p>Wednesday 29 September, 1915</p>
<p>On guard again.</p>
<p>It is a glorious morning. Just like a morning in December at home only not so hot. I am thoroughly enjoying it.</p>
<p>The rumble of the warships guns on the right is now incessant. They are miles away from us &amp; yet the ground seems to tremble when they are fired.</p>
<p>Mac took some papers to Capt Fitzgerald &amp; in the goodness of his heart gave him pretty near all we had in the place. So we are stranded for spare paper till next mail, I&#39;ll see that he isn&#39;t so kind hearted next time.</p>
<p>We have been told that we will be out of here by November but in the words of the Scotchman &quot;I hae ma doots&quot;.</p>
<p>The 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Field team&nbsp;of siege artillery gave &quot;Abdul&quot; a surprise. They landed about 12 very high explosive shells in the Chess Board. They were just like young earthquakes.</p>
