<p>Time is flying &amp; I seem to have so much to tell you.<br/>Ada Crossley's husband is a Medical Officer attached to 29th C.C.S. so we see him every day.<br/>We are still very happy &amp; comfy  Our boys are spoiling me. It is delightful to work with our own men again. The sisters of 29th C.C.S. are very handsome &amp; well made girls, but they are awfully good &amp; happy with us. I do hope we can stay here together for sometime.  <br/>The coloring of the autumn tints are magnificent but it is fearfully cold &amp; the wind is blowing hard to-day, so the trees will soon be leafless.</p>
