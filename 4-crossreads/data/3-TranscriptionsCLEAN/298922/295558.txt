 Still HOT in Cairo . 
  I am quite busy deciding what KIT to take & what to leave behind. The days are Hot here but cold in England I expect.  
 Had lunch with Nowell at Camel Corps Mess - he is better & goes out to his Regiment tomorrow. 
 We looked at many old photos of "Carrakoorte" & other places. Nowell gave me photo of 2 young Lion Cubs he  is taking  took to England from Abyssinia the last time he went HOME.
