<p>Sunday 25 February 1917 [24 February 1918]<br/>Day of mixed feelings.  All A.A.N.S. [Australian Army Nursing Service] up to Matron 10 a.m. to be lectured re red capes.  Matron Quelly sarcastic &amp; Lamb equally so in some instances.  Andrews long-winded of course &amp; determined to be in the scene in some way. &ndash; and we are here "for all time" &amp; no moving on as we used to think.  I apologise for Lamb afterwards &amp; find she &amp; Doonar are the only offenders among us &ndash; others will pass.</p>
