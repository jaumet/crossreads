  
 Am in an English Hospital nearby right now.  Dysentery has left me.  Will write shortly. 
 Wish your Father & Mother a Merry Xmas for me.  Tell Violette, also that I'm looking forward to those sox. 
 Ta ta for present.  Let 1916 see you a victor over the Peat bog push or you're no friend of mine.

 A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
