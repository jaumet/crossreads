<p>4.  half's messing about.  My Two Escort &amp; self then caught the next train back to Bournemouth.  We had a look at the Weymouth Beach &amp; Clock Tower.  It is a long beach with a Promenade but only a shingle or pebble beach not a bit of sand.  Now Bournemouth is all sand &amp; no shingle.  I left my Friend's address at Bournemouth at Home so I could not see them until dinner-time on the next day.  I went to a Boarding Place &amp; read my Book until about 10 &amp; then got to bed.  In the morning I went down to the Prom. &amp; Beach before 9 pm.  It was a glorious day.  After I had shaved etc. I looked for my Friends on the Beach but failed.  They were out on the Pier all the Time.  Anyway one of the other Boys &amp; myself ventured in for a swim.  Gee, we took a risk.  I was game to even think of going in.  But it was just lovely &amp; the water was no different to what it would be in September in our own Surf.  Of Course there was no surf at all only ripples.  After dinner with my Friends Annie &amp; I went for a row.  A stiff sou-west breeze had sprung up &amp; I can tell You it was nice &amp; choppy.  My little friend had never been on the Sea-Water before so she was very game to go out with Me when it was so rough.  But we had a lovely Time. I rowed out a couple of miles in the Teeth</p>
