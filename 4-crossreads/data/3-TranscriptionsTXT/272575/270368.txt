The world famed work of Josiah Wedgewood.   They were very interesting   I saw them from mixing room to Showroom where they have a collection of Crockery, Vases, etc. that are worth money.   The gentleman who took me round told me that they are at present filling large orders for America.   The Yanks dont mind what they Pay as long as they get the goods.   Goodnight now much love to all from your Loving Son Chas.   wrote J. to advise Parcel sent From Newcastle
