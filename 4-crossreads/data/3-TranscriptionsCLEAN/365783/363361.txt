  
 Just before lunch we passed Mocha - we were a good distance away from the town but with the aid of glasses could make out the curious flat topped houses, the semicircular domes of some of the buildings & the tall lighthouse looking like a big barber's pole with its alternate bands of red & white.  In the afternoon a deck hockey match between the Nos 1 & 2 General Hospitals took place, our hospital being victorious. On Sunday 10th January we passed the lonely Daedalus lighthouse marking a small shoal in the middle of the Red Sea.  In the early morning of the next day we entered the Gulf of Suez - land in sight on both sides - barren & rugged mountain country.   On the starboard side there was a wide stretch of gradually rising sand between the shore & the foot of the mountains.   Each prominent mountain peak that we passed was reckoned by some one or other to be Mount Sinai - as a matter of fact it is some considerable distance inland & has probably never been seen from the deck of a ship.   At breakfast time the "Maliva" bound for London passed us - the family of one of our officers was on board her.   I felt quite jealous of him that it was not my folk that were so close instead of his.   We heard that she had mail aboard for us but I do not hope to get any as any letters she may be carrying for me will probably be addressed to London.
