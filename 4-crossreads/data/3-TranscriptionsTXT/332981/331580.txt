are very small & are driven by Motormen & have girl Conductors, & are look very neat in their blue uniforms. The steam trams have an engine in the lead with 3 to 5 cars behind, & are well patronised. As we had to wait nearly an hour for a train to Ronet we decided to walk, going along the River Sambre for some distance & then up along the line arriving at the Depot for tea, as we could not get anything definite about departure we had to stand by for the evening and at 11 pm was ordered out to the station were we received orders later on to go back to Namur to take a Leave Train for Calais, after a lot of waiting we arrived in Namur at 3.30 am & after taking water we left at 4 am with a large number of German carriages crowded with boys.
The run to Charleroi was very slow, being delayed at nearly every signal, as the traffic ahead was very busy. Every time we stopped the boys came along for boiling water to make tea & as one injector was blowing back, they were soon supplied with a dixie each.
