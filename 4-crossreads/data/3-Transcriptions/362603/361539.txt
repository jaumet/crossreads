<p>2.  Maid called me at 8 am  so I got up &amp; dressed &amp; after breakfast set out to No 2 Queen's Dock, by the overhead railway to see if I could meet Capt. Collister, whose ship the "Keemun" had just arrived from China.  He was not there He had gone Home I suppose, so I did not bother with His address.  I caught the 11.30 pm boat to the Island then.  It had been blowing a gale for a week so there was a nasty sea running.  The old "Fenella" was running &amp; she is a brute.  I know the Stewardess so I went straight down below &amp; got to bed.  I was O.K. until about 2 Hours off Douglas.  Some beast then ordered Irish Stoo &amp; they put some very strong cheese on the Table.  That got me.  I was sick the rest of the 2 Hours.  When I got off at Douglas I could hardly walk.  I missed the first train as the Boat was very late on account of the gale.  I asked when the next train went &amp; they said 8 instead of 7.  Auntie &amp; Marie were waiting at Sulby from 6 pm till 9.30 pm, in a cow-shed, having had no Tea &amp; as cold as charity.  We got Home at last &amp; were all very glad to get to bed.<br/>In the morning I helped Uncle re-top a Hay-stack that the wind had blown down.  I threw up about 40 sheaves without a fork, so the sea-sickness did not affect me.  I spent the afternoon with Auntie &amp; Marie also the evening.</p>
