<p>29th.  Packed up &amp; left Le Transloy this morning at 9.30 &amp; marched to the same trenches we were in a few days ago, it was a glorious morning &amp; as we slowly marched along it seemed more like a huge picnic than anything else, all over the place horses were quietly grazing on the new Spring grass &amp; they were enjoying it properly while the chaps who were looking after them were lying on the grass sunning themselves</p>
