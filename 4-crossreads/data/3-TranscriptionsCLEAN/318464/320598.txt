It was brought from the neighbouring islands in lighters, and discharged into tanks at Anzac, then pumped to the tanks at the foot of Walkers Ridge.  Mules carried it up the hill to our tanks, then we carried it in kerosene tins to the cookhouse.  A quart a day was issued to every man for a few weeks, also a pint and a half of tea.  All went well for a time, and then the storms prevented the water lighters from landing and sinking a number;  so water got very scarce, eventually finishing up with a pint  a day  of tea a day, and a pint of water every 3 days, which was hardly sufficient for a hot climate like Gallipoli.
