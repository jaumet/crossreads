<p>5/9/15    Looking round &ndash; We are in a defile at the mouth of which is open sea, at the other end is a steep bluff. On either side cliffs rise abruptly all sand with clumps of low stunted brushwood about 2 feet high. The whole place has been cut into terraces on which we have stored our men. They are all on one side &ndash; that nearest the enemy. 10am. Went through the trenches opposite Quinns post for the first time. Entrance overlooks the Agean Sea with sea, land at feet for miles round. Shrapnel bursting on hills occupied by Kitchener's army. At feet a camp of Territorials. On right the whole line of trenches of Anzac. Went in with Field Artillery Officer. Bullets whizzing about and had to be careful. Saw the whole position through telescope impossible to describe but simply one mass of earthworks, and incessant crack and burst of shrapnel, cordite &amp; bombs. Stench of dead very bad. Men &amp; officers killed over a week ago still there and gradually undergoing disintegration</p>
