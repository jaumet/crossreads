  
 Billy & I will both come Home on the same boat & perhaps Erny Thomas also.  I am glad that Cyril is O.K. & shall be pleased to meet my old Friend Mrs Whitehead, also Auntie May Stephen & Annie Dobson.  I do not remember Mr Bibb & Elsie Wilkin.  Poor Jess Sheedon I know well of course.  I do trust that she does not suffer in consequence of Her unfortunate illness. 
 I shall not relate much of my experiences during my Holiday.  I went about a great deal but with the exception of Sulby Glen & Glen Helen, of which I have written previously, I only cycled & walked with Uncle, Marie or Auntie round about Summer Hill & Ballabane Farm.  I saw Granma & Auntie Jennie & Gran looked fine; although she was suffering from muscular rheumatism
