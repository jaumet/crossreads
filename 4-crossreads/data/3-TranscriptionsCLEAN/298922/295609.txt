  
 Tuesday 6th November 1917 
 Went War Office re passage ITALY, nothing doing & I may be several days in England yet. 
 Laura had lunch with Dorothy. We went to bed early & I had another bad night. 
 Forgot to acknowledge 2 letters from May, the usual want of time to write & hurry her life is made up of, but please thank her when you write.
