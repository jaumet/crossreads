<p>blockbuster, &amp; batteries of the enemy, the French Infantry carried out an assault <strike>almost</strike> against the German line between the Suippe &amp; the Aisne.  The enemy's first line was occupied almost along the entire line of attack.  The French advance continues.</p>
<p>These fragmentary tidings of good news are very welcome &amp; distributed amongst the troops are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>We receive daily war office telegrams printed in excellent style on super fine paper, whilst a sheet called the Peninsular Press also comes along at regular intervals giving us news of the progress of European events.</p>
<p>This interesting printed matter is turned out by the R.E. staff at Imbros.</p>
<p>Sunday 26th Sept. 1915</p>
<p>My <strike>bivouac</strike> dug out is finished &amp; is an excellent type of the sandbag shelter used on the peninsula.  I am beginning to find work <strike>very</strike> more congenial though the days drag somewhat at times.  In fact the same dull routine is repeated each day &amp; the country has acquired an air of quietness relieved only now &amp; again by <strike>the shriek of shrapnel in the distance</strike> an occasional retaliation round from shrapnel rifles which are the only indication that we are actually at war.</p>
<p>There are two things worth living for in this world &ndash; love &amp; war.  The worst of it is that you cannot materially enjoy both at the same time.  Experience has taught me the bitter truth of all this, when I talk of war or its attractiveness, I don't refer to gay &amp; happy regiments marching along to the accompaniment of brass bands or the soul stirring notes of the bugle &amp; the medley of pipe &amp; drum.  I allude to the roar of thunder &amp; clash of arms of the battlefield, of the silent secrecy of bayonet attacks under cover of darkness when cold steel finds a resting place in the quivering breasts of a thousand an one of our enemies to the shambles of death wh a bright morning reveals in some quiet verdant hollow where the bodies of our brave comrades &amp; those of our enemy lie inextricably mixed to be loosed into a common grave "unhallowed &amp; unsung".  It may appear somewhat paradoxical that these things should be so loathsome &amp; yet so attractive &ndash; the answer is simple yet irrefutable, the men go on &amp; they love it all.  The ethics of it I cannot explain.  Considered from the true Christian standpoint war is bad.  There is nothing in it compatible with biblical law.  In battle the savage beast is uppermost &amp; our desire is to slay.  We are urged</p>
