Tuesday Ap 2Turks are concentrating & another scrap is expected. The Armoured Cars have gone up to Esault to hold the road. We crossed the Jordan again today & took up again our old positions. Coming along the road it was pitiable to see the Women & Children trying to get back to our line,  knowing that the Turks would Massacre them. We were bombed crossing the River & finally camped near Mt of Temptation on Jericho flat. Worst stunt I was ever in & in my opinion we received a hiding this time.Wednesday April 3Jacko bombed at dawn all
