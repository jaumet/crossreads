Gallwitz Tr 26/2/17
The same men who had done the first attack would have to be done used again. Issued an operation order by Col Davis and we all knew we were going to certain death. I put in a report to that effect and got it endorsed by Sale. Stewart warned 24th to stand by and just before the time to hop over 3 a.m. orders arrived cancelling the attack and asking for guides for the incoming 24th. It was great relief to get this. Relief started to arrive and by dawn most were in. With a few others I left the cursed spot at 8 am and got down to the Batt HQ at 26 Avenue. 
After a little to eat there I slept for 10 hours, found the 27th Batt relieving us and then walked back to Shelter Wood. Tales told of Gorman wandering through Warlincourt wearing a gumboot on one foot and a muffler on the other and brandishing a tomahawk. Got back to the huts and after a meal went to bed once again and slept heavily. Our losses 2 Off Missing believed Killed 9 Missing 5 W or M 42 [indecipherable]. Never so nearly dead in my life
