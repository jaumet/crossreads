you ask how I like Egypt its would be a very nice place to tour in, there are ten thousand wonderful strange sight to see in this old time country.
but to live here would be no good to me. theres to much sand not enough rain, which reminds me a lovely shower fell last night or this morning the first real rain I have seen this side the line, I don't like the natives extra, some of them are interesting then they become a nuisance. The educated among them are different.
Am glad H. has got a job a meant to write to him but can't just yet. may get a chance later on If we are still here thank B for her letter
