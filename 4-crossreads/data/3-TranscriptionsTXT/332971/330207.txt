My little camera has given & is giving me more pleasure than I can say.  When off duty I have two hobbys - remembering you - & photography I am handicapped with the latter because of film & self toning or printing paper not being obtainable on the Island.  Kind friends can you read what is coming, if so, I hope it will be to join me in my pleasure by sending some along for a  VP Kodac though tis not only my pleasure but I trust many others.  There is nothing I can think of more than would gladden a Mother's hear than a little snap-shot of her boy.  Already I have been able to give our boys in B2 Ward one each to send home for Xmas & they were delighted.  I am nearly at a standstill now, but am hoping Mrs Fiaschi will send some from England -  She will if it is permitted, but I'm doubtful for when we were in England no cameras were allowed to be used - indeed one of our Sisters was so innocently using one one day & she was all but imprisoned for it poor little thing she was terrified.  There is nothing much to tell or can tell - Truly it makes me smile when I say that because unintentionally I tell you all the items that I think you would like to hear.  Rumour says that Lord Kitchener is on his way over here.
10th  Today in the lines I passed a dear little dog, stopped & made a great fuss
