<p>97 December 12th<br/>I am glad OByrne passed; I am extremely sorry that old Leckler is not with us &amp; as soon as I am exchanged, I will certainly do all in my power to have him repatriated as soon as possible. It is a crying shame, when one knows that far worse cases than our own are being overlooked, &amp; still our govt will not interest themselves unnecessarily as regards Prisoners of war &ndash;</p>
<p>December 13th<br/>There is a Cinema show here twice a week. Officers also go out for a walk twice a week. There are about 600 officers here French &amp; English, &amp; the Camp is run very systematically. The German staff here is equally as good as at Freiburg &ndash; very polite, perhaps it is because this is purely a concentration camp for people eligible for repatriation &ndash;</p>
<p>Very cold indeed our mess is going along O.K. I play plenty of Bridge nowadays, especially with Tremlott &amp; Stones &amp; Gracie</p>
<p>December 14th<br/>130 French officers, who passed the Swiss Comm. June last, left early this morning &ndash;</p>
<p>Had long yarn with Matthews &amp; Bernard, Australians of 5 Div captured last August,. They came from Strohen &amp; have related to me some most horrifying incidents &ndash; I was glad to learn thro them that Gardiner &amp; all 4 Bgde officers there are O.K. &amp; well. Several attempts to escape have been made &amp; quite a lot succeeded. Mott was successful in his first attempt &ndash;</p>
<p>Played Bridge &ndash;</p>
<p>December 15th<br/>The cooking arrangements at this camp cannot compare with those at Freiburg, otherwise the camp is quite a good one &ndash;</p>
<p>Had a glorious bath today, the bathing arrangements are simply perfect, that is where Freiburg goal failed.</p>
<p>Received my first parcel today it was forwarded on from Freiburg &ndash;</p>
<p>French concert tonight The orchestra here is really splendid, simply marvellous for a Kriegsgefangener orchestra &ndash;</p>
<p>December 16th (Sunday)<br/>The Senior officer here is a naval Commander &ndash; He officiates at the English Service which is held every Sunday &ndash; we have a very nice chapel here.</p>
<p>The arrangements for Drawing parcels is more complete than at Freiburg, whilst the tin drawing system could not be better &ndash;</p>
