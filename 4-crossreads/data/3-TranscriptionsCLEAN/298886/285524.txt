  
 at 2 p.m. The last party (A Squadron) is following behind about 4 hours. Full marching order strapped and weighted oh! the heat 
 It was a happy time Just glad to get the things off. Oh! this shaking of the train! 
 14th  April  May. Gallipoli 1915. With the exception of C Sqdn who were left on Quinn's Post we all withdrew from the post and were sent down Monash gully and up one of those water sheds which the peninsular is so famous for. I found a dug out and after I had made some tea I turned in for the night. Orders were issued to the effect that nothing was to be taken off in case of a sudden stand to. However I went to sleep and I was awakened about 2.30.AM  The time C Squadron was going over the parapet
