 live, but it didn't seem to trouble him.  He turned to the chap next to him who luckily was one of our mates &amp; shook hands with him.  His last words were remember me to the other boys &amp; get my cigarettes out of my pack.  With that he fell dead.  So ended the life of a good Soldier &amp; a fine pal.  Of the Four of us that left Singleton together I am the only one remaining.  I wonder if I shall ever get back. 
 By Monday night the strain was beginning to tell.  No sleep &amp; hardly any food does not tend to strengthen one's nerves, but there was nothing to do but stick it.  On Wednesday night after 4 days solid fighting we were relieved by the Naval Division, but although we now had a choice to have a good sleep, I found it impossible to do so, my nerves were all on the jump &amp; every little while I would wake with a start;  nor was I the only one, fully 80 per cent of the men were the same.  Well Bertha I am afraid I will have to close as time is short to catch the mail.  So I will say good-bye for the present, with my very best wishes to all Goorangoola friends. 
 I remain very Sincerely Yours Arch. K. Jamieson 61 
 P.S.  Please excuse the envelope, but the others are all to small. Arch.
