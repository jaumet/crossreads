Dear Sec.I received a parcel which you had been good enough to send along to my troop containing 24 shirts, they could not possibly have reach us in a better time, or place, as most of the men were badly in need of shirts, as where we are it so very difficult to purchase them.
We are having a very easy time just at present, though the conditions which we live under are not the best.
