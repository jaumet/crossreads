<p>All the trees &amp; shrubs are out in their green &amp; birds of all kinds sing &amp; chirp all day long.  Through this lovely wood run tracks &amp; tramlines, breastworks &amp; trenches, many of them named after the streets &amp; places of London, Picadilly Circus, Regent St., The Strand &amp; so on.  In one part stands a log hut, the Batt. H.Q.  It seems a tradition that every Batt. occupying it should put something on its walls and so on the door is a fine painting of the Black Watch coat of arms, Durhams, English &amp; Irish troops &amp; then Australian.  It is here that Bairnsfather, [Capt. Bruce Bairnsfather] the war cartoonist, spent some time &amp; there are some of his sketches.  Some of those which have delighted thousands were made in this little log hut in the dense wood of Plugstreet.  It is very noisy.  A curious notice is found posted on</p>
