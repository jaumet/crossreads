 26/1/1916 Dear Beat &amp; Family Just a few lines to let you know i am in the pink of condition we left sydney on the Thursday i sent a post card to you i lowered it down on a bit of wire to some fellows in a little boat to post i would like to know i they posted it. Beat we are well out now i am eating like a horse i have not been sick once but plenty has we have not seen land for days you see nothing but water day and night we land at our first place on Sunday but we cannot get off the boat that is bad luck we are not supposed to say where we land or what boat we are on but it is a good boat plenty to eat and a bit of drill and plenty to read and any sort of game you like. The only thing that is troubling me is weather you have shifted or not when you do shift you want to write strait to the Victoria Barracks and let them know your address if they send it to Greta make arrangements for Billy to get it and forward it on to you till they get your new address. [A sentence appears to have been censored]. The only bit of rough we have had was going through the [again a word censored] plenty of up and down there every body seems in the best of Spirits. their is no news Beat you see nothing but water no tram accidents here
