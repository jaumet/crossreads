<p>"Ponteporus" tells us the following - There are here about 6 or seven Dutch warships of which 2 always remain in the vicinity during nights, circling round "Pontoporus" as though to watch her. At the first meeting with the Dutch warships "Pontoporus" shows the Greek commercial flag as ordered. On 18th Sept a trade steamer!  blue funnel with black ring &ndash; is brought out of the harbour by a Dutch warship beyond the 3 mile limit.</p>
<p>The 1st officer from "Marckomania" who was in charge of "Pontoporus" had no complaints about the conduct of the captain &amp; his crew; only the captain thought his men should not help in the coaling. But as the 1st officer promised them money if they would work, they declared themselves willing. The coaling is being done from 2 hatchways from "Marckomania" At dusk the Dutch torpedo boat is coming direct for us, encircles us and remains in the vicinity.</p>
