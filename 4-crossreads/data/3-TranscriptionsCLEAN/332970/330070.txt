 This climate is not a healthy one, and the troops are feeling it. Perhaps living in the desert, with the  corresponding  natural adjunct of a dust diet may have something to do with it,  but a great many men  also a little bit too much work in the way of training, but certainly the percentage placed hors-de-combat by such things as pneumonia, bronchitis, pleurisy etc is rather light.
