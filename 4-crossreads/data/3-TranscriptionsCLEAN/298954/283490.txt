  
 Mon. 25th June. Their escape was not discovered till now even though the Germans had made a couple of trips to the island for fruit. 
 Today we were counted, Little Willie demanded information and screamed with rage when none was forthcoming & bounced off to get our "Strafe" from His Mightiness the Kammandant.   He ran back and informed us that we were no longer to be treated as gentlemen (!!!) but were not to be treated as prisoners.   And our punishment (because the other two got away) is to be confined to this filthy hold for 23 hours daily for 28 days.   We are to receive no Wireless Press news whatever and are to have the privilege of buying small articles from the cantine stopped.
