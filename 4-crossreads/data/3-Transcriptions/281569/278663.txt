<p>28 April, 1916 Friday</p>
<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>Nothing on the boards at all today so pulled the old bus down everything OK inside she is wearing splendidly not as much as a mark on her yet. The C O put his horse into work today for tomorrow week &amp; she promises well although fairly fat inside at present Chissy's horse is favorite still &amp; we hope ours puts his in the stable. Rumored unconfirmed still regarding Gen Ryries death, some say he was shot through the stomach others through the head, but we had 177 casualties through worse luck, we expect to get a move down that way any time now &amp; none will be sorry to move either from this hole no word yet of our positions face still very sore where he pulled half my jaw from.</p>
<p>Bed at 10 pm.</p>
<p>29 April, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Hopped out at usual time.</p>
<p>Still nothing to do but just the usual routine &amp; no mail to hand yet although it is expected in a day or two with parcels so the sooner the quicker for the larder is pretty low at present.  A plane passed overhead today on its way to Nara it is rumoured that our friends the Senussi have got anti aircraft guns with them now so no libertys can be taken although the country is very quiet at present no reports coming to hand for days, things don't seem too favorable up at Kut &amp; relief column is too slow &amp; is now held up between two marshes &amp; they in turn will have to mind their flanks or they will be entrapped also, Downing is not doing too well in the Squadron so furphy has it.</p>
<p>Bed 10.30.</p>
