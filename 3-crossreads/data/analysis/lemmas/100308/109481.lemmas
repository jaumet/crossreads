 Favreuil not possibl to see veri far on either flank . Arrang to fill the gap between ourselv and the 24th by feed up some men from the rear wave but the 24th converg on us and gain normal connect . The men grasp the idea veri well and kept veri close up under the barrag as it bright chain of light retir . Flare denot the take of the first object . By gradual stage the second trench was reach and more flare fire but here the lead wave becam too thick owe to the road boundari go off at an angl and squeez the men into a heap . Here the Gener had some word with the Colonel and , as the old man said , " stamp his foot " . It was now near light and a thick rime of frost was on the grass . Away on the right could be seen the wave of the 5th Bde . The 21st now pass through us and push well forward and seem to be keep good line
