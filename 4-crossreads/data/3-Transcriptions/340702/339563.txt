<p>to mention that Bluey now wears his uniform. The Technical units are now cutting mining sets out of rather valuable woods even Walnut sometimes. What awfull waste. Aussies sent away a large parcel of prisoners yesterday. 400 Must make a good impression on the Froggies.</p>
<p>A soldier asked a man what was the ribbon he was wearing. He answered proudly "That was for the retreat on Mons" The other replied I suppose you will be getting a couple of Bars to it now.". An unkind reference to the Somme &amp; Armentieres retirements. According to the "Daily Mail" there are 700000 Americans in France now, Well up to date I have'nt seen one American Infantryman. I have seen plenty of Technical Units. By the way their Engineers wear revolvers on their Hips real Cowboy style. They are armed with our Rifles. They look rather awkward with them because they slope arms differently to us. Eastway parti</p>
<p>15.6  Letter to Keller today</p>
<p>16.6  Fritz got one of our Baloons at about 9.30P.M. It made a magnificent spectacle coming down in Flames. He put up a regular Aerial Barrage with his A.A.C. Artillery just previously</p>
<p>From the 17 Mar till today 18.6.18 we have had beautifull weather. That is since Fritz's offensive started. There is quite a drought on now &amp; it is very difficult to obtain water. A lot of the wells have run dry. Fritz got another of our baloons today.</p>
<p>19.6 The drought has broken up <strike>again</strike> . Rain today. Seen Coo'ee's last night. Seen a magnificent flare last night it seemed to stay absolutely motionless while I was watching it, for at least 10 minutes. It was dropped from one of Fritzs planes</p>
