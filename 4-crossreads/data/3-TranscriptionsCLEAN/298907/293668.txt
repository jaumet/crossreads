  
 I have got quite a reputation here what with writing love letters & telling their characters, things are running merrily, Nurse Smith would have hers told yesterday so it fixed her up & she reckoned it was splendid, you wouldn't believe how serious they are over these things, I have also been in great demand for autographs I have something in all their books now, one especially I should consider myself lucky to have been asked to write in & that is Nurse Smiths, her book & it is only a small one dates back to 1907, & she told me that she allows only those whom she considers as her personal friends to scribble in it, so I suppose thats good enough for me, shes a very nice girl & I think quite a lot of her
