Chief town Jamestown.   Length of island, 9 miles Breadth 5 miles.   3000 inhabitants.   Chief products Indigo, cotton, and fruit.   The inhabitants were not sufficiently interested in us to come off and see us so I dont know what they were like, or whether their color was white black or kiwi.<br/>Jan 4   We left the island on 4 January at 11 am.  I took a photo of the whole island when we got far enough away, but it was even worse than the other.    At six am on the 8 Jany</p>
