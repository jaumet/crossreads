<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>Just a P.C. this week. I have had an awful busy week &amp; I've 25 letters to answer now. We had a Dance last night &amp; I was secretary of the Committee. Well you can guess there was plenty to do &amp; I had to do all my own work as well. I worked like a nigger sweeping dusting etc in the Hall. We had a loan of a lovely Hall but it had to spring cleaned. Anyway it was a grand success. We or I sent out 180 invitations &amp; we had over 200 People, mostly from our own staff &amp; the W.A.A.C. Anyway there is only the final meeting now &amp; then I'll be able to settle down to my letter writing. I may go up to London tomorrow or Tuesday to buy a Billiard Table for the Mess. Last Monday I went to Salisbury in connection with Tickets &amp; programme for the Dance. I visited with My Friends &amp; spent some time with them. Ellis has gone for a walk around the Block but I went out this afternoon for about a 6 mile walk &amp; it was actually very hot, I am feeling pretty   leg weary now.  I had a lot of ham this morning for Breakfast &amp; I was as thirsty as possible. Well Mom I have given you all the news except that Dave Niness has sailed for Australia. He is well but was sent Home for special reasons. Best Love to all X Harry X</p>
