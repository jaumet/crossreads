<p>Aunt Hannah came down on the previous Day but we could not come down on that day as it was so wet.  We had to cycle through a snow-storm to the Station as it was.  I visited Mrs Grundy &amp; Mrs Gibson both Sisters of Captain Collister.  They gave me a very cordial reception.  Gran was pretty stiff about the shoulders with Muscular Rheumatism but I took some dope over to Her to rub with.  I had good weather most of the time &amp; good voyages across.  The Germans are nearly all repatriated back to Germany from the Island now &amp; the Government is to release more steamers by Whitsuntide.  All are well at the island &amp; we had a real nice Homely time together.</p>
<p>Well, My Dear Ones, I must go to bed now.  It is just on "lights out" &amp; it is getting very cold.  Dick Toppin comes down for the weekend this week &amp; I am to meet Ellis in Salisbury on Monday or Tuesday next.</p>
<p>We cannot send cables re our return but Ellis aught to be Home the latter end of June or beginning of July &amp; I should follow a month or so later.</p>
<p>Au Revoir<br/>Best Love<br/>Harry</p>
