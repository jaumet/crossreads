<p>[Note at Side of Page]<br/>At Pont-de-Briques I saw the Chateau where Napoleon stayed when his army to invade England was encamped outside Boulogne.</p>
<p>trams at Pont-de- Briques, 5 kilometres from Boulogne. The remaining 10 kiloms. is an interesting part of the journey. In one part the tram passes through the Forest of Hardelot with a little further on tall sand dunes on the right &amp; fertile fields on the left. The lakes of the "the Mirrors" &amp; "Clear Water" are passed &amp; then we arrive at the Chateau d' Hardelot an old feudal fortress  where Henry VIII once resided for some time.<br/>Near the Chateau is a cottage which belonged to Charles Dickens. The Chateau stands in splendid grounds &amp; before the war was a great centre for tourists &ndash;  the golf links being well known. However, now it is a centre of military activity where there are rows of white tents &amp; Machine gun and Lewis gun schools established. Hardelot itself has a fine beach &amp; also a splendid tiled "dique- promenade" 2000 ft. long. Bleriot the aviator[?] lived in one of the houses facing the seafront &amp; also had his hangars at Hardelot.</p>
