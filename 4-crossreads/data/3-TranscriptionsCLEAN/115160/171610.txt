 Dear Jim 
 I was so glad to have a note from you. I will have to watch & always remember No 5 I was just thinking about writing again when I got the letter I am pleased to hear you are well you will be thinking now your time for leave is surely not far away I see now in the morning some soldiers from France & that is not at all what has been for some time no overseas men were to be seen on the platform at all. I had a letter from Miss Kelly & she also said she was sorry my brother had been taken prisoner she has misunderstood me I think when I last wrote - no Jim, John is still working in the R.O.D. & thankful he was not been fighting
