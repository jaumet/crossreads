<p>D Company<br/>1st Batt<br/>Egypt<br/>11.1.16</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>Received quite a batch of letters yesterday I hadent been getting mail except from the Miss Smithers before , But since joining the Batt we are all getting our letters. I am glad to hear all are well anon there. I am keeping just ok myself haven't had an off day since coming across. I dare say long before this you have had some of my letters I have been writing you all every week &amp;amp: will continue to do so while we have the chance. Will write every opportunity.There isn't any need to worry am quite satisfied with things across here. I had to smile at Miss Smith wondering how we fared for darning our socks &amp;amp: how our meals are prepared. Just tell her we have a housemaid to make our  beds &amp; a French cook for the meals, I don't think.We fare very well as regards our meals get as much as we can eat as well prepared as one can expect in camp life. I am very well satisfied with everything. If we never experience anything</p>
