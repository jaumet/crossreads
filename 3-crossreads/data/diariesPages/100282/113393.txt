Have been out to Eiffel Tower the big Ferris wheel she is some ride round takes 20 minutes to do the circle I don't know how high she goes, but men below look like ants running about. Tobacco is very scare in Paris nearly all tobacconists have notices in their windows to the effect that they are sold out, when they get a fresh supply you ought to see the people line up in the street waiting for their turn to buy how pleased they look when they come tumbling out with a couple of packets of what the French call cigarettes, our fellows would sooner go without than smoke them so you can guess what they are like, if you give a Frenchman an English cigarette 10 to 1 he will put it carefully away so that he can enjoy it on some special occassion, it seems so funny to us seeing great crowds of people of both sexes lined up for tobacco. The train bus service is very good wonderfully cheap you can ride for miles miles for 1 pence.
