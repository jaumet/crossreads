Mon 14 Oct
Toby Barton is in Camp. He informs me that Bert Hunt is in the Con. Camp, so I must go and see him. The weather is rotten ? raining every bloomin? day. Toby also told me that Jim Eldridge and Charley Whitaker were killed. Was very sorry to hear it. Lill will be sorry to hear of it too, as she held Jim's hand over at a Concert at Queen's Park.
Tues 15. 
Toby Barton went up the Line today. Saw Bert Hunt and had a great old yarn. Went to the Pictures and had a Feed of Eggs at Sal. Army. The war news continues good, and the End is certainly felling near.
I'll be back with M.S. soon now, I hope.
Wed 16. 
Went to Pictures with Bert Hunt. He has put in for a Pass tomorrow so I must try and get in with him.
Thur Oct 17. 
Went into Havre with Bert Hunt. Made another attempt to find Art Gallery, but ended up in "Tostones". Had a pretty good day.
Fri 18. 
Lille has fallen, and several other important towns. Fritz is getting all he wants nowadays. Bert is warned for draft, so I guess he'll be going away tomorrow. Scotty McFadyon called to see me, and Ernie Calf. Quite a lot of the 8th have been here this last few days.
Sat 19. 
Bert Hunt and "Scotty" went away today. Ernie Calf went into Havre, so I went to the "Yellow Dandies" Concert on my own. Pretty good show.
Sun 20.
Went into Havre. Had Fish and Chips for Tea. Bought some Cards. Met a chap out of A.S.C. and knocked about with him. Saw a lovely silk scarf in a shop today which I?d like to buy for M.S.
