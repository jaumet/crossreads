<p>is a very slow old place , any of our towns such as Orange would beat it hollow for business, but of course the age of the place, with so many old colleges and traditions make it the important and renowned place that it is. I spend most of my spare time looking around the various colleges or else in a canoe on the river, I had no idea that canoeing and rowing was such good sport until I came here. There are fish of sorts in the river but I have not tried my hand at them. I don't think they could come up to the old Macquarie cod, and it's a bit too tame catching fish you cant eat.</p>
