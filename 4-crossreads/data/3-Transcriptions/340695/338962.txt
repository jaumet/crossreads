<p>I prolonged the <strike>agony</strike> bliss I assure you. Invited me to call back again that day but time would not permit. I was vain enough to think I scored a hit. Mr Wade was waiting for me &amp; we strolled around with eyes well open. Had a light snack coffee &amp; cakes for tea &amp; made for our automobiles &amp; were soon wending our way back leaving frivolity behind us. It is a beautiful road from Amiens to Albert straight as a dart with one exception place called Querrien where it bends &amp; starts<br/>off a fresh. Tall trees border the road the whole distance, I'll leave the rest to imagination.</p>
