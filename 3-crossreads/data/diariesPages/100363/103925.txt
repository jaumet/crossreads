recent rains. By an ingenious idea of laying down wire netting on the desert sands, excellent roadways have been made as far as Gaza; beyond here the nature of the ground changes to a clay which has made this arrangement impracticable. As G.H.Q. are now more than 50 miles behind the lines, I have decided to push on to Aust. Hdq tomorrow evening. Transport is my most difficult problem, there being great scarcity of cars and the railways are decidedly erratic. Owing to the bulk of my equipment and distances to be covered Camel or horse travelling is almost out of question.
23rd December /17
Morning spent writing letters and afternoon between writing, musing and looking out over the barren expanse of sandhills that surround G.H.Q.
