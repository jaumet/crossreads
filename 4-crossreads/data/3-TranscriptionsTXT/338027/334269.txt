 Wednesday, 11th November, 1914 Cool breeze I forgot to say that the Col had to call on volunteers to go down as [indecipherable] as the firemen could not mop up steam.  Only a few days off Colombo expect to cross the Equator to-day.  No matter how hot the day it is a strange thing that there is always at least one shower during the night.  There have been more buried today but considering that there are 36,000 troops the death rate is not large.  We have not heardanything concerning the Minator [Minotaur] who was chasing the German Cruiser Koningsberg [Konigsberg]. 
 Thursday, 12th November, 1914 Tropical showers prevail, without any warning they pour down but only for a few minutes. 
 To-day the Melbourne steamed away to Colombo with advance orders for the fleet.  The Minator [Minotaur] who is in pursuit of the kongsberg [Konigsberg] has not reported so far.  An armed merchantman of the C.P. &amp; R. line passed us to-day en route to the Cocos Islands to repair the wireless &amp; cable stations destroyed by the Emden.  She will also bring back the remaining prisoners as the Sydney could not hold all.  This boat is of the latest armed liner type and I think her name is the Empress of Africa.
