  
 In the Trenches, 8th. March 1917. 
 My Dear Parents/. I was delighted to receive two more letter from Mother to-day. Those proofs you enclosed of father are very good indeed and were not faded in the least. I am anxiously looking forward to receiving one of the photos. We will be leaving the trenches to-morrow for a short spell and a rumour is gaining credence that we will shortly receive London leave. I trust it may prove to be correct.  On the whole we have had a quiet time in the trenches this time. Fritz got a bit obstreperous to-day and began knocking our terrace of houses about but only one man was wounded and he only slightly. I received a long letter from Stirl. during the week and also one from the Healy's renewing their invitation to Dublin. If this leave comes off I trust I may have the opportunity of accepting it. Their son Joe is a lieutenant with the A.S.C. somewhere in France. I also received a letter from Ossie Ellis, one of Stirl's friends whom I met in Sydney. He is now through his course as a doctor and has arrived at Salisbury Plains.
