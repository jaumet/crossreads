<p>East Maitland,<br/>27 April 1916</p>
<p>Dear General Foster,</p>
<p>Just before I left Sydney my son, who has a commission in the 3rd Divisional Cyclists, told me that Brissenden of the New South Wales bar, had been transferred to them from the engineers as a Corporal.  I hope you will not mind my telling you what I know about Brissenden.  He is an LL.D., and has a practice at the Bar that would entitle him to take silk as a matter of course if he asked for it.  Apart altogether from his legal attainments, he is a man of outstanding ability and strength of character, with a very wide range of interests and accomplishments.  He is amongst other things a very competent mechanic.  I remember seeing years ago a heliograph that he had designed and constructed.</p>
<p>I am sure that if you knew Brissenden, and saw him doing a subaltern's job, you would look upon it as an unfortunate waste of good material.  I have not seen him, and have no idea what his own views are, or whether he would be pleased at my interference.  I quite understand that there may be difficulties under our local regulations in giving him any higher appointment.  Perhaps these difficulties would not operate so strongly at the front, and I feel sure that you would be doing a public service by mentioning him to the Divisional Commander, who would probably be able to find a better use for him.</p>
<p>I have some hesitation about butting in in this way but I know you will pardon me.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,<br/>David G. Ferguson</p>
