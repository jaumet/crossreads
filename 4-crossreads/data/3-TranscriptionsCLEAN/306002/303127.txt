1.5.15Sat. 1st.  My name is in orders this morning as Corporal.  We have been getting great reports of the doings of the boys at the Dardanelles, dismounted parade & were cleaning gear & watering the horse lines.  After dinner we had nothing to do, but lay about the tent.  Boxing with Conway after tea, & put the night in writing.  To-day was fairly hot.
I believe more wounded have arrived from the Dardanelles.
