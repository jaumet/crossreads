<p>February, 1917. Friday 9<br/>Stayed in bed all morning and in aftn. had a shave and a good wash. To go out at 5 with Sgt King. Now find it is old job thanks to Dave! No wind and good moonlight but time dragged. To be a raid on to-night but I didn't hear anything until [indecipherable] early in morning.</p>
