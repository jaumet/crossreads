amongst themselves, The Guards stopped the fight before anyone was hurt, Worse luck!

On January the 5th we had a very hard frost which froze everything & made walking very hard, The ground was so slippery that it was hardly possible to walk about without slipping. Till January the 18th we had snow falls every day, sometimes it was accompanied with rain, every day it was bitterly cold.

On the 18th it thawed which made it very wet underfoot. The snow continued to thaw until it finally dissapeared on January the 23rd. On Thursday 24th I got a postcard album with a lot of different views of Lüneburg on it, A chap belonging to the Welsh Guards presented it to me.

For the past six months I have been constantly in recipt of letters from England & also from various people in Australia in addition to those from Alma and Etta. It is not necessary to say how the German food is, It is always bad, and inmost cases absolutely unfit to eat.
