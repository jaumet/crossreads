<p>19th<br/>Going out for 10 days rest.  Went into dug-outs vacated by the 7th, who have gone into firing line. On fatigue all day, and at night we went out to dig a trench to some deserted trenches that the Turks prowl about near every night.  We dug like rabbits till daylight, and cleared back home.</p>
