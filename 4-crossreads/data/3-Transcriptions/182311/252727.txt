<p>Dear Captain Peters,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are much indebted to you for the further collection of records which you have so kindly made available.&nbsp; I greatly regret that this is the last we shall receive from you, but we are delighted that we have been successful in obtaining so interesting a collection of records as yours. In fact, I think your records comprise one of the most complete collections of personal records which we have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction which you have compiled will be of much assistance and we are much indebted to you for the trouble you have gone to in preparing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again thanking you for your gernerous response to our appeal for your war records,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours sincerely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sgnd.&nbsp; R. Treloar.</p>
