The batteries were firing hard and the shells were humming over with splendid regularity. Walked over to see Mackinnon whose men are in breastworks on the edge of the Wood and having a quiet and easy time. On the edge of the Wood is an old camouflage tree one time used as an O.P.

Left with McCartin, Smith and Sergt Tripp for the front line at about 9 p.m.
