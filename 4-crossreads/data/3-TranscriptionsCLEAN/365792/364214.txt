May 11 flooded out, & its run better than our Aust Detail Camps. In front is the Canadian Hosp surrounded by a low stone wall & a small forest of trees - mostly elms. On the left - Canadian Conv Camp, on the right the main road & a British Conv Camp, & to the rear, ploughed ground & several clumps of trees. The boys are playing a friendly game of cricket & causing a little amusement. Occasionally the ball lobs on a tent & of course the occupants do a bit of a roar - or else "duck". Two of my cobbers left today for the Destructor. Did a bit of dusting at the Canteen, & then played Bobs? for a while. Went for a stroll to No 13 Hosp & got a letter which arrived ye'sty from Ethel. Also visited Nap's Monument but was too late to go up top. The surrounding gardens are lovely & on the way to & from Hosp I had some lovely views of the ocean, & the country round about. Plenty of girls knocking around.
