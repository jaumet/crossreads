 Spare cash   &amp;  I wanted to send him some tobacco but of course did not have time to buy it. He had had some leave   &amp;  been to visit some of his relations. Hope Charlie   &amp;  Ron are kept in England for some time yet. I hate the thought of any of them coming over to fight here. 
 So glad to hear that you are all keeping well   &amp;  that little Eddy will be able to commence School. Suppose Fred will soon be back from leave   &amp;  then I may see him. I shall try to write to my friends. I did write a few lines to Annie thanking her for the soap, also to Mollie. 
 Very pleased the Lucy visited Mother   &amp;  hope you will all be friendly now. 
 Love to my friends   &amp;  tell them to write to me. 
 Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all. 
 From Yours lovingly Edith
