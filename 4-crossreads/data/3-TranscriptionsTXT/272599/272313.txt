 1917 Tuesday 13 Feb. 
 Nothing of import happens during day. Duty as usual at 8 p.m. Hayman my relief has developed a boil on his neck. They are very prevalent due to lack of vegetables. "Chats" have us in their power. The dugouts are alive with them &amp; we cannot get a change of clothes. A Fritz aeroplane brought down one of our this afternoon about a mile away. Both our chaps were of course killed. Some of his planes are faster than ours.
