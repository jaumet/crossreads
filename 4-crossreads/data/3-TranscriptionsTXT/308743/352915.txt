Reveille at 6No lunch today as we were on fatigues straightening camp & lay out new lines shift tents up towards the mess room after lunch we all set to get new correspondence by the 12 oclock I had eight polished off so more than content to sit back in the afternoon Tob & I went over to the hangar & inspected [indecipherable] biplane which only a few months ago flew from Cairo to Khatoum a distance of 20 mls. This machine has flown lots of miles & not one accident.  The  [indecipherable] is just swathed in names of well wishes of his admirers. At the rear is another [indecipherable] to judge by the [indecipherable] Bed at 10

After lunch huge motor transports began to arrive then later 1/2 battn of infantry put in an appearance later on in the night the other half also arrived these men form part of the second force & are from [indecipherable] if possible [indecipherable] a real good time which follows a right royal feed after parading the streets for a while & visiting renowned places we fill in the evening at the [indecipherable] Bed 11.00
