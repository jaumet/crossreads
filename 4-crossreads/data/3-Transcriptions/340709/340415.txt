We had dinner on the "Warrego", music on the "Sian", &amp; flying visits to all the ships in port, to say nothing of marching solemnly through the major's office in single file. We expected a wigging &ndash; but didn't get it.<br/>When returning later (much later) to our domiciles &amp; ships the rain came down in torrents &amp; we were drenched to the skin; but "what do we sea-dogs care?"<br/>Mon 11th on board Destroyer "Yarra" at sea : Instead of travelling on the "Sian" I joined this ship last night for the trip to Rabaul. We are to call at several places en route and are travelling in company with "Warrego" &amp; "Parramatta". Madang was left at 8 pm.<br/>When about 15 miles out a light was sighted to the N.E. and the "Yarra" was ordered to investigate. We opened out to 17 knots and rapidly over-hauled it. It was thought to be the "Elax" which left harbour an hour or two before the destroyers. As we drew abreast the searchlight was got to work; the darkness was suddenly pierced by a brilliant shaft of light in which the rain-drops (it was coming down fairly hard) scintillated like diamond points.</p>
