 Route march in morning. Having a little money, five of us, Alan, Ron Piggott, Norman Lloyd, Gerald Spring & myself hired a car for Salisbury & arrived there in time for lunch. We forthwith proceeded to the "Gold-Fish", a nice little house after the style of the "Chic" in Hunter St. and there did the disappearing trick with certain rissoles, chocolate pudding etc. 
 After a wander round the city Alan & I had tea at the Soldier's "Guest House" and then visited the popular "Picture House". 
 We caught the 11 o'clock bus & arrived home by 1 o'clock.

 Church Parade at 9.30. Hot-Bath at 10.30. Ron Piggott & I then walked to Salisbury (10M.) & had afternoon tea at "Guest House". In the afternoon I went for a walk along the river bank with my nurse, Miss Hayter, and had tea with her at 5.30. After tea I went out towards "Old Sarum"
