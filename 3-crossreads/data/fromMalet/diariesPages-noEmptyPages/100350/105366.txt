(3) Fritz Artillery again very busy.
(4) Enemy Artillery start "Straffing" about 8 o,clock this morning and keep nobbing up till midday, they played havoc, they tore up one of our light railways, dropped several shells into a large (Soldiers) cemetary and uprooted many dead bodies, scattering legs, arms and fragments all over the place. Even big trees were brought down, fair sized pieces of timber were sent flying through the air and so on.
(5) Another lively day, "whips" of shells whirling about, several casualties among the 12th Bde. Major Howden M.C. was among those killed, he was second in command of the 47th Bn. He served on the Peninsular with the old 13th Bn he was a splendid Soldier. He was decorated for work done in the same scrap as myself.
All for the present Dear X
