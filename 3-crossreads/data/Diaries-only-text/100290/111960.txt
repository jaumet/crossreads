1916 July 18
Tuesday
An exceptionally furious bombardment began at 7 p.m continued without interruption till daylight. Something must be doing This part is considered one of the hottest of the line.
Stayed about our billets all day expecting orders to move on. Did not come. Went to see some trenches further in wood. Wonderfully constructed, deep long. Artillery arrive in wood several batteries. Mud slush. Short rations Go down to village and augment our tea with fried eggs bread.
