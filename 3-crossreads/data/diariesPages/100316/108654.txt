Rode on to Ribemont. As the main crossroads was being heavily shelled I made a detour along the river and missed it. A bridge near here was quite intact despite a terrific bombardment of its locality. There was a big crater only a few yards off it and the whole area for hundreds of yards round was a churned up rubbish heap. Rode through here and across open fields to a hillside at the foot of the Mares Wood and here found Matthews presiding at a conference of the Coy Commanders. Last night it seems that Cowan and a few others blundered into a Hun post and one man was shot through the head and left dead in the enemy hands. Our guns did two shoots with heavy stuff while I was here and provoked only a very little retaliation. Rode back through Maricourt to Heilly. Tonight we are sending up some limbers to salvage tents from the old C.C.S. at Edgehill. It is very close to the firing line and I doubt not the tents will be well shrapnel riddled. Returned to Camp and found M. Leon Barbier to Mess. We yarned and translated some French doing Cazottes "Amoureux Diable". A Boche plane came over early and dropped some bombs round the Wood. All our archies and L.Gs. opened up they succeeded in turning him back. The tracer bullets we fire are not as good as the German. Our rifles are now being issued to the Americans and in the streets of Franvillers tonight Billjines were telling them its secrets
