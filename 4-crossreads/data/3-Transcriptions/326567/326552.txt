<p>Sergeant &amp; as I told our 1st Warrant Officer who through out a suggestion that I should control the Chinese Sanitary Men on my own &amp; release a Sapper who all along had the handling off. I told the 1st W.O. that I could not manage the two positions at once &amp; he said that he had 15 waiting for my position. I told him there &amp; then to put one in my place as I was as just as pleased to go out Driving again, with the result that on Sunday 25th Sept I was releived of my position by a Sergeant who held a First Aid Certificate &amp; I took up my old duties next day. During Sunday my Chum the Bootmaker &amp; I proposed to build a Hut for ourselves as soon as possible, so as I was not booked up on the Road until Monday night during the morning of the 26th I went about the bush looking for some material to build with. I came across several old Huts which had not been occupied for some time built</p>
