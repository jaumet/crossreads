<p>The &quot;Rio Pardo&quot; is moored alongside of the Australian Transport &quot;Aeneas&quot; (which sailed from England four days after our departure and reached the Cape two days sooner).&nbsp; Greetings &amp; &quot;sarcasms&quot; are exchanged.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. the personnel of our vessel is granted leave for the day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am one of the few who are detailed to remain on duty.&nbsp; Apart from occasionally viewing Table Mountain.&nbsp; Table</p>
