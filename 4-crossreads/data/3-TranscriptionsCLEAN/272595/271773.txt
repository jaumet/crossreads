  
 down every Saturday afternoon to do my shopping, one has to get all manner of things today I had to get toothpowder, soap, pencil, new diary paper & envelopes, films & prints, & my weekly couple of cigars, the town was simply alive with "Aussies" the main street is getting a second "Picaddily" on Sat evenings, after we had done our shopping Charlie & I went to a show there, one item was exceptionally fine, Vallances conjuroring, he is an "Aussie" & is giving exhibitions under the Y.M.C.A Management wherever troops are in training, after coming out of here we went & had a little supper & then walked home along the leafy old road that leads from the town to the various Camps it was an almost perfect night not a cloud in the sky & the air nice & nippy
