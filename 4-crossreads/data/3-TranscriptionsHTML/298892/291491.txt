<p>Military Police searched every corner of the city for deserters, men absent without leave, and chiefly men masquerading as returned Soldiers. They had over five hundred in the guard tent next morning and I believe about eighty of them were fake soldiers. It is a pity they don't have these general clearing -ups oftener and I believe they intend doing so in future. Liverpool is an immense camp as you will realise when I say that there are about Sixteen thousand soldiers in it. The main road through the camp is lined with small shops and there is also a large Billiard Saloon with 9 tables in it. The infantry camp is exceedingly dusty on a windy day but the A.A.M.C. is situated on a rise some distance off and escapes most of it.<br/>Just opposite our hut the Applicants for the light horse go through their riding tests and we have many a good laugh at some of them. Part of the test consists of riding over three hurdles and numbers of the men come to grief on them. None of them seem to be any the worse for their falls and generally hop up and on again.<br/>I suppose Douglas finds it hard to fill up his spare time. I trust his destructive tendencies are not breaking out. Has he heard the result of his Examination yet?<br/>Have you received any word of or from Kevin?<br/>With best love to you and father and all at home and next door.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene.<br/>I trust things are going satisfactorily despite Vesey's well meant efforts with the Type-writer. I would love to see him struggling with it.</p>
