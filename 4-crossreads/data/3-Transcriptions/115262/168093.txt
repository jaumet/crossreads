<p>Thursday 22 November 1917.</p>
<p>Went to Ramleh with 15 patients in sitting cacolets to Anzac Receiving Stn. which is in a <s>modern</s> building of modern architecture &amp; was formerly a church &amp; a hospital.</p>
<p>Had a look through the Monski. What struck me most was the ancient oil press &amp; Bedouin plough shop where Bedouin plows are made &amp; repaired by ancient methods.</p>
<p>Returned to bivouac at 4.30 pm.</p>
<p>Moved to new position on advance 5 miles further on the Ramleh-Jaffa road.</p>
<p>Reported to Bgde Hd Qrs as despatch for 24 hrs.</p>
