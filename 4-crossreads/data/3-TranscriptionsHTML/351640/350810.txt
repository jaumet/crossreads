The powers that be in, a country or rather Empire like ours, can deceive some of the people all the time most of the people for some of the time but not all of the people all the time.  They must let us know after a time.</p>
<p>The Australian hospitals and their personal, will for the most part, be kept in Cairo for the Egyptian Summer.</p>

These two, absent from the precincts of my present above, are much appreciated.   I heard today that Captain Pierro Fiaschi is to be my assistant here, if so</p>
