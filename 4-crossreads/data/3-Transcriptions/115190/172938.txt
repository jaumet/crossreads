<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The 5th Cav Divn relieve us and we return to Damascus (20 miles).&nbsp; We meet a heavy thunderstorm on the way &amp; reach our old camping spot beside the Baiada at Dumar at dusk &amp; wet to the skin.&nbsp; We off saddle feed up &amp; prepare our tea.&nbsp; I have saved a few rashers of nice lean bacon &amp; have just put them on the fire when along comes the order &quot;saddle up</p>
