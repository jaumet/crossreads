Done nothing much today for the boys were very tired it took most of the day to get cleaned up
2nd The Coy. rose early this morning went for a bath they had to walk to Fricourt a distance of 4 miles or so. I did not go for I was too crook I am getting much weaker in the chest I think I know for certain that I am not as strong as I used to be, however this is only to be expected after the exposure I have been through since joining the military I am expecting a breakdown in a couple of months or so it was just as well I did not go to the baths for they could not get a bath on account of the water all being frozen so they got a clean change of clothes back they came swearing like troopers
