<p>19.3.16<br/>Sun 19th<br/>It was cloudy this morning went to Tukh-El-Khail with Ahearn to see where they were camped.  had a good day &amp; thoroughly enjoyed the ride  Harvesting is in full swing with some of the crops &amp; most of the cockies were busy carting in the sheaves on camels;</p>
<p>A pontoon bridge has been erected across the canal opposite the camp at Tukh-El-Khail &amp; it was there that the Queenslander fell into the canal with all his gear on a few weeks ago &amp; drowned;  we had to do some skillfull manouvering through some irrigated plots to get to the camp as we did not know the track;  All the natives in all the villages we passed through &amp; those working in the fields are as friendly as it is possible to be &amp; all want to give us "Backsheesh" for ourselves &amp; horses</p>
