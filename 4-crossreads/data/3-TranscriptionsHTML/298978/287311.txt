<p>In this revision of my Diary for which my friend Mrs Haines has so kindly acted as amanuensis, I have described exactly my feelings at the time the incidents related occurred.<br/>Owing to lack of space, opportunity, and, in part, inclination, much was omitted in the original diary that is now herein set down.</p>
<p>Whether of no this record of my experiences during the first terrible year of the Great War will be of interest, time alone can prove. When the din of battle has faded into the realm of the past, and the country is strewn with memorials paying tribute to those Great Heroes who gave their lives so gamely for the Cause; these little sidelights on the lives of those of them that were at Anzac, keeping fresh the glorious tradition of a Great Empire, perhaps may be of value.</p>
<p>I may rewrite the rough details into something more tangible, though so much that is good has been written on this subject that perchance I had best occupy myself with other matters</p>
