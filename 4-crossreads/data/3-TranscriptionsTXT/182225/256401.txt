 OCTOBER &nbsp; Monday 9 &nbsp; 1916 
 Fine but cloudy. Helped to remake C Sub stables in the morning and we had to scrub out the hut in afternoon &amp; then move all out things outside &amp; the AMC man sprayed it all with some disinfectant. Poss &amp; I went out to the Maple Leaf pictures at night &amp; my word there was a rough show on. Campbell told me that he had recommended me for a commission all right, but he did not know when I would get it as he said it would most likely be in the &quot;sweet bye &amp; bye&quot;.
