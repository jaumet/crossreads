Friday 14th  Pay day drew  1.  A terrific gale blew all day, hail & wind tents were flying up in the air in all directions, bitterly cold and nowhere to go save to the Y.M.C.A. where their was a concert given by a very amateurish civilian party, it was agony sitting there freezing returned to tent expecting warmth in blankets only to find our tent down.
Saturday 15th   Met N.S. in morning went to Valletta & Sliema in pm had enjoyable day went to pictures at Sliema on return.  Met pretty little French girl inside had a pleasant chat sorry when we had to face the cold miserable long drive home.  Probably be going away this week.
