Of course one is much nearer the front & its ever so much more exciting & interesting than it was.  I was getting absolutely bored at the D.A.C. & left without a pang almost.  Ah well I had a good time there till just at the last.  It was a good job.
Mr. Playfair is the Adjutant here, not Jack, the other one & he's simply A1.  I do hope I do all right.  I didn't get much of a drilling in it, arrived here one afternoon & my predecessor left next day at 11.  He has got a commission in Trench Mortar Battery, so have Brian & Bertie Macnamara.  I haven't seen them lately, I'm very glad but I wish it weren't trench Mortars.
I had a letter from Jack Busby, he is in England.  I thought he was an officer & got such a shock to hear from him he was a driver.  Fancy I got three letters from you at once 24th June, 3rd July & 8th July, it was sweet of you & is too to write so regularly & often & I do appreciate them.
