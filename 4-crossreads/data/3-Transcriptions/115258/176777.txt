<p>1st Jan 1918</p>
<p>My dear Hal &amp; Fred,</p>
<p>A happy New Year to you all. This is my first 1918 letter to thought I would write to you boys. I expected to have some letters from you to answer but my mail this time has slipped a bit.</p>
<p>There has been a big mail in and other chaps have got letters dated up to 15th Nov - but my last mail from home was 23rd Oct and it came before Xmas. I think it is caused by a chap <s>nam</s> in our transport named H. Wilson who stopped a bit of bomb at Beersheba and they have sent my mail to hospital to him. However I wrote to the Base P.O. yesterday</p>
