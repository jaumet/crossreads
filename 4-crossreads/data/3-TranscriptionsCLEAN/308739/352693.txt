  
 Sunday 16 April 1916 Col. Fuller in charge of Church Parade, very quiet in Camp all Day. Writing Home.  These camps that we occupy seem to be stepping stones to some big movement that the  Anzac Mounted Division  is contemplating.  The men are disappointed in having to lie idle so long, & one wonders why so many valuable lives are not put somewhere handy to the Enemy's position.  All interest in Drill & disipline fades away, when there is nothing to do. 
 Monday 17 April 1916 Regimental parade very Hot. Scaffording erected on which Sacks of Straw are hung for Baynoit Exercise.  5th Reg. putting in a good deal of time at  this class of work. Col. Wilson of the 5th Regiment is the Senior Col. of the 2nd L.H. Brigade & Major Newton is adjutant. The 5th are also fortunate in securing the services of a well tried M.O. whose name is Major McClean. 
 Tuesday 18 April 1916 Orders out to rise at 5 a.m. owing to Hot Weather.  Baynoti Exercise & Trench digging to be the order of the day. Much talk about shifting soon to some other spot.  One would think we we paid to tour Egypt, for we certainly see a vast amount of Country. 
 Wednesday 19 April 1916 Regiment left at 4 p.m. for all night stunt at Outpost Duty about 3 miles from Camp.  I camped with H.Q. staff & enjoyed the outing immensely.  Brig. Ryrie inspected the outpost at 10-30 p.m. Picket pegs are of no use in Sand so we fill up Sand Bags & sink them in ground tying Head Ropes on Same.
