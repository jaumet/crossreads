while we were having tea. I was unlucky being end man on the lower side, the stool broke away collapsed I slid down onto a nail with the other 5 on my side on top of me which of course helped to drive the nail in, add to this the Table its contents, Tea, Sugar, Jam, Butter, cataracts of table utensils and you may guess how I felt. I visited the Dressing Station right away.
