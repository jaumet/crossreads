have a go at the cursed Huns.  According to the Argus, the Russians have started again.  This time I hope they finish the job and carry all before them, as it means the war will the sooner be finished and Peace reign again.  The sooner the better so that all of us can get home to be with those we love and have left behind.  My two brothers are well thank God, and have both had 14 Days in London.  They say they had a tip top time.  They deserve it after 2 years hard fighting in Gallipoli & France.  One of my pals has had his leg taken off below the knee.  He says it is hard luck, but he is not worrying.  Miss Warner's Mother has not been well lately and of course she is worrying about her mother.  Her last letter to me said that her mother was progressing well.  Now I will close as I have to be about seeing that the men have cleaned up.  Hoping that your Mother and Sister & yourself are well.
I amYours sincerelyGeo Fitzpatrick
