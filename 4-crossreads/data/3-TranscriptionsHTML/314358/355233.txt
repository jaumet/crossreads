Hoe he had been doubtful of his way.  He remembered that, then he had sighted two little crosses, (old landmarks to him) and had suddenly known where he was.  Had refound his north and was glad.  Then how he had wished more than ever for his life and had run till he reached the main transport road, and then part running, part walking had at last shuffled in and was here.</p>
