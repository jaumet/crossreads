  
 The people seem superior to average Jerusalem people. We are camped among Olive trees and amid good surroundings. The weather is cool and at present we are having a good spell. Tuesday June 4 This morning we were oiling wells & in afternoon examined Aquaduct which brings supply of water from Solomon's wells to Bethlehem. Wednesday June 5 visited Bethlehem today. Very much struck with this place will write my impressions later.
