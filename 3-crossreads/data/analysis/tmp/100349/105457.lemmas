 I have ever seen . At this time of the year the flower garden that sweep down to the river a ablaz with colour and the clip tree and neat lawn make a charm scene . I had not dream that the work of man could be so beauti . Had dinner at " Les Goblin " Regent St . and went to see " Theodor Co" London is veri quiet of a night , now that the light restrict are in . 21/8 /17 An odd morn , so went to the Tower of London , and half a score of other place , includ the Royal Stabl where I inspect the King Hors . Splendid beast they are too . Saw much cun craftsmanship in steel and gold at the Tower . I wonder how those ancient workmen did it . Saw the Crown Jewel ; 4.000.000 worth , all in a heap . A dazzl sight . They are quard by " Beefeat " , huski chap too .
