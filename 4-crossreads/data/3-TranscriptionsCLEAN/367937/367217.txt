  
 The other day I took a photograph of a policeman and he was so pleased when I gave him a print that he took Rostron and me over the Police Station and Court House and there was a court being held at the time it was very interresting. 
 16th Sunday Yesterday I posted you another registered parcel of a containing a little statue of a horse which I hope you and Mother will think pretty.  I know Mother likes anything crystal and any way it is a good one of a horse and ought to look nice in the dining room at home - It is a god job that I'm going back to the desert soon as my tin is beginning to get low - it really has lasted me very well considering how I have gone about and spent money down here; but I have still got over 2  left and there is about 5 pounds of pay owing to me and you cant spend any at Tel-el- Kebir so by the time I get another leave I ought to have saved up a good bit again. Suppose you are feeding off the wheat now and the Corriedales will be lambing on it; have you sold any of the cull ewes yet? I have bought a book of Lindsay Gordon's poems to take back with me; it was the only one I could get - now that I have got my two kit bags with me I can keep a few extra things which is jolly nice.  Love to Mother.  I do hope you are having a good winter. I am your loving son Rob.
