 Daisy was quiet indignant when I told her you said to keep her at school so long I tell her it is the happiest days of her life but I suppose she is too young to realise it yet 
 [Page 2 of the letter written by Mrs Doolan (page 214):] Daisy had a letter last mail from Beaty but there was not much news in it. The next Contingent leave on Saturday the 22nd Inst there is to be a public send off The School children are to sing in (Hyde Park) Daisy is one of the picked to take part She is in raptures over it She is also to sing &amp; dance next month at Canterbury at a Concert for the Belgians. She is up there to day practising in the Tableau She  takes the  is dressed in Russian Style. 
 I dont know who you mean was drowned in Newcastle I told you a young chap was killed at the Steel Works but I forget his name Granny O'Brien &amp; Doolan are fairly well. Two of the (Emdens Guns) arrived here today on the Steamer Montoro it is probably that they will be publicly exhibited in a few days. I expect there will be thousands going to see them 
 There is a rumor that you re leaving Egypt shortly but there is nothing in the press about it as yet Some of the men told their relatives in their letters

 My Dear Mother 
 Just a few hurried lines during my Middle watch to let you know that I am still pegging along safe and sound hoping that all at home are the same. This life in the trenches is getting very monotonous. I wish the war was finished it is a very trying life. We are tuckering as well as can be expected under the circumstances We get fresh meat every second day the other day we get Bully Beef and Bacon but the only thing I dont like is that we cannot obtain bread it would be a very welcome visitor just at present but still Australia's sons are never down hearted. It is a very hard thing to get water here as it is a scarce item unless you walk about 3 miles to get it what myself and my mates do we sit at a little trickle down in a gully for about 2 hours to get a kerosene tin full you grow very weary of it but we stick it alright. We also get an issue of cigarettes and matches weekly. I had a very narrow squeak the other day there were 3 other of my mates myself and "Tom" having a swim of the beach when a schrapnel was fired just passing over our heads and burst to about 5 yds away. but none of us were hit. Well Mar I think that I will close with love to all at home so Au Revoir but not good-bye from Your Loving Son William Reece 
 [Page 2 of the letter written by William Reece (page 213):] Continuation of other letter in reply to yours, 25th of 4th and. Do you think that the 3rd force are a better stamp of men that our force who are in the firing line. Yes I received the papers alright No I missed Uncle Ern we went away from Egypt too soon. No Tom is aright and well. Albert is doing well too the last I heard of him No I never received a card from Dad yet Yes remember me to Mrs Richardson please tell her I am well again and back fighting once more after my wounds. I am sorry for Emily if Jack August has been discharged Remember me to Phill Foran and tell him I hope he is better soon also to Frank Raper. Received Papers &amp; Bulletin O.K.
