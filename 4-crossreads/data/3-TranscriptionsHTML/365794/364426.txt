<p>Friday, 27 January 1917 [1918]<br/>An eventful day as regards this quiet life.  Asked Matron at 9.30 a.m. for leave &amp; rec'd it.  Confirmed at 11 a.m. when Matron &amp; Col. Young &ndash; it being inspection morning &ndash; came round &amp; I was called up to be told leave was granted, then a hurried trip to town with Marge from whom I rec'd my first bunch of Cairo violets.  Bought blouse Pt. 45, no riding skirt obtainable.<br/>4 p.m. tea at Groppi's &amp; then evening duty &amp; warnings from C. Grant not to build too much on my holiday &amp; I shall be disappointed but I am not expecting too much.  Visit from Cobbie 8 p.m.  Why has she changed so from the days of G.H. &amp; dear Kath?</p>
