 Appointed batman to Major Quick & like a fool, accepted it. Found on arrival at the site of my new duties that I have to help two other batmen attend to four, - taking the meals - waiting  daily  every other day with one of them while the other does all cooking. 
 Absolutely rotten ! ! 
 Narrow escape; shrap pellet alighted two inches from my toe as I was standing in front of dug out.
