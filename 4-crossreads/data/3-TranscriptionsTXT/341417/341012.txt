So we fed up and got our gear off our aching and sore bones, had a wash which refreshed us a little, but we wanted sleep so we fell down on our blankets into a dead sleep on Christmas morning. But one of my mates managed to wake us up to have Christmas dinner, but we were still very sore all over and were for three days after. Well we had dinner out of the good things we managed to carry with us that you sent me in the tins from home and from D. & J. Fowlers. We enjoyed them I tell you after being some time with an empty stomach, though we were half asleep.
Then much did not happen for two or three days bar outpost and short patrols, where we once went along the beach and found that there were steamers lying at anchor unloading already and small mine sweepers at work and a man-of-war protecting us, it reminded me of that awful hole Gallipoli very much; and we also found the railway not far behind us for they lay it very rapidly.

We then had a good look at him to see where he was and how he was but we did not hurt him that night, but we returned right back to our camp again at El-Arish and found everything alright, bar that the Square-heads had been over with his plane and dropped a few bombs but did no damage.
