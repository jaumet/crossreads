<p>To Mrs Ferguson</p>
<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>In the last letter, I received from my nephew, Sergeant P.J. Fryer, of the 18th Battalion, there a few lines, which I thought may be some small comfort to you. He says, we put in our spare time, in keeping our comrades graves in order. I have just left the grave of Capt Ferguson looking beautiful, He was a fine young fellow. Well liked by us all. He says further, he will call on you on his return, if he has the luck to do so. You may remember him, as previous to his enlisting, he was in the employ of the "Civil Service", &amp; in their service called on you.</p>
<p>I have ventured to send you these few lines of my nephew, to let you know, your brave son's comrades, do not forget him.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>L Fryer</p>
