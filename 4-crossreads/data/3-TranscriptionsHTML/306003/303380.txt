<p>When we were out to meet the Turks a few days ago we caught a stray mule, &amp; a few weeks ago, we caught a horse that escaped being hit when the Tommies were cut up at Qatia or Oghratina, he was very poor, as it was practically impossible for him to get water during the 5 or 6 weeks he was on the desert, he is picking up fast &amp; has been given to the Interpreter;  6 or 7 horses were led in this morning &amp; were half dead for the want of water, we still have a few missing;  We saw plenty of dead Turks &amp; Tommies around Oghratina they had been buried very shallow &amp; the wind had blown the sand off them</p>
