<p>17th Dec 15<br/>We are again out of sight of land &amp; doing 14 knots per hour.  We passed a Light House this morning right in the middle of the Sea, (10.30 am)  It must be a very lonely place for the keeper.  It was of interest to us as Port Suez is only 320 miles (or 24 hours steam from it<br/>Another Hospital Ship passed within 300 yards of us &amp; we again "fell in" &amp; cheered them as they passed.  The New Zealand Transports have caught us up &amp; I am afraid are going to beat us in.  We just heard that our boat is to be quarinetined on arrival, so we are very down hearted.  We have an epidemic of Mumps on board.</p>

The Water was wonderfully calm &amp; the Hills on either side looked magnificent.  It is just the Same Picture that one sees in the Biblical Stories. In the distance you could see the Trains going over the Hills.  When we got up the Stream you could see about 40</p>
