<p>5th September:- Tuesday<br/>My birthday and enjoy the advanced age of 23 to-day.  The pouring rain has cleared, but very dull &amp; signs of plenty more. Take a brisk walk to work. Drizzling rain at lunch time &amp; having brought no greatcoats get slightly wet. Cold wind &amp; rain all the afternoon. At 5.30 pm a rush home &amp; hurrying round buying some things to drink etc., &amp; as we have a little party of Legge, Pal Madame, Madamoiselle &amp; I &amp; it's the prettiest little arrangement one could imagine. Madame has done the whole business thoroughly &amp; we three (the old Irish Contigent) enjoy the most pleasant evening for a long while. After a most enjoyable dinner &amp; talk to the tune of some grand old port wine we adjourn to our room, leaving the ladies    &amp; have a great talk</p>
