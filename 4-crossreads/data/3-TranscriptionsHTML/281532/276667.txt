<p>31/8/18 Herbecourt</p>
<p>Slept in until 7.30. At 8 orders came to be ready to move at an hours notice. We are now so mobile that an order for a lightning move like this causes no perturbation. Greatcoats are quickly rolled into section bundles and dumped under the guard of a cook at the cookers. The Lewis gun panniers are put on the fighting Ambers and the No 1's carry their guns. Signalling stores are among other gear put on to be carried forward as far as we can. Attached we have 2 Stokes Mortars with their shells and a limber to cart them also 4 Vickers guns with their transport and packs. This raises our fighting total to something like 350 fighters. The amount of Officers leave that is now being granted is proving a serious drain on our officers strength but as I told them yesterday the War must not be let to</p>
