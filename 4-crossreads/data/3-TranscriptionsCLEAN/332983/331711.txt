Awful, How men managed to gain a footing there is a mistery, We saw barge loads of wounded returning to the transports, the Hospital ships were unable to hold them, The time shrapnel was coming over in hundreds, 13 or 15 pounders, One punt load of wounded came close to our boat and the chaps on our boat shouted "Are we down hearted" and the answer from the wounded was "NO". In the mean time the Navy blazing away like fury. The old Majestic, Triumph, Eurallia that used to be the flag ship of the Australian station, also the Ocean, The Queen Elizebeth with her 15 inch guns, beautiful weapons too I can assure you, and a lot more Battle ships that I don't remember the names of, An incident that is impressed on my memory was a man with a helio signalling he was on a hill signalling to some one on the beach, he was there for a number of hours signalling away, time shrapnel bursting all around him. Presently the Helio stopped flickering, No need to say what happened. Some of the 9th Battery a section to be correct landed with guns and horses. And I am told by men who were there on the beach that the cry was, why don't they send us artillery
