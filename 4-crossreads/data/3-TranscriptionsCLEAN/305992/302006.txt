  
 distance 500 yards 2 perecopes & 1 conning tower above the surface. Jap. destroyer rushed over firing depth charges from her 7.5 Howtizer. Having been met with a extra escort of 1 British destroyer 2 sloops 2 motor chasers 3 hydroplane 2 monotors one towing a observation ballon & 5 trawlers. Another Jap. being a few hundred yards away put on 30 knot speed. Two British sloops & submarine chasers rushed towards the German submarines & dropped dozens of depth charges also firing heavy shells. The explosion was terrible. All ships of the convoy put on utmost speed & steamed away with 15,000 troops. The Indarra being fully a mile away when the heavy depth charges were rolled over from the Jap distroyers & British sloops shook like a leaf in fact as if they had struck her. Through the glasses we wittnessed one submarine blown completely out of the water flames smoke & water arising fully 100 feet high & blown to pieces. Continuous firing of depth charge systemetically for 30 minutes. A splendid sight. One that would never be forgotten.
