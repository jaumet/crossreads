Just caught the Scotch Express at Euston at 10.30 P.M. Writing this in the train as it rushes to the north Splendid rolling stock here, and the lighted stations that flash by look like a lighted street.
24/8/17.
Arrived in Edinburough at 7.30 A.M. yesterday morning. Put up at the Waverly put myself outside a real Scotch breakfast porrige, herrings an "a". Got my bearings in the morning; a very nice city it is too, a delightful quiet place after London. Had a splendid day here; there are a lot of our chaps about. Inspected the Cannongate, the Castle, Queensferry and the Forth Bridge; sampled the whisky, it is good and there isn't a "heid-ache in a gallon o?it."
Went to the theatre and Observatory Hill. Where those interested in astronomy can have the necessary seclusion. Back to Waverley; and
