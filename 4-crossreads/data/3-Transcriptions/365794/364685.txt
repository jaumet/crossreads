<p>Tuesday 9 October 1917<br/>Excitement great when nearing port.  Land sighted 12.30 p.m.  Our boat A.33 at last flying English flag, also flies yellow all time in port.  Left ship 3.40 p.m., took car to Galle Face H., gorgeous place, had 4 p.m. tea on lovely verandah facing ocean, Room 44 2nd floor.  Took rickshaw to town, shopped till 7 p.m., dinner 7.30 to 8.30., shopped hard, bed 12 m.n.  Oh the wonder of it all, soft voices, olive skins on well made shoulders, poor shaped limbs (legs) as a rule.  Such pretty green trees &amp; beautiful residences of the English.  When in the rickshaws boys run along the beach parade saluting, handing the glorious frangipani in &amp; singing snatches of "Tipparary" [Tipperary].  Bought 13 moonstones for 3&frac12; rupees (= 4/8 english), 6 good ones.  Posted kimono to Nell, cloth Hild., collars I. &amp; Mag.  Dining saloon huge, Indian waiters &amp; enjoyable food.  Gentle lace sellers begging us to buy most lovely lace.  The street scenes please one most, so many strange sights &amp; different dresses.</p>
