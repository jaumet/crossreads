After all the "Tassies" have left the Rio Pardo, quite reluctantly, I am sure! - we steam out to sea once again.
Of course the anchor is lifted before doing so.
A very rough sea proves friendly after we turn North.
July 22nd
A bright, sunny day!  At noon we have 411 miles to travel to "Our Harbour".
We now number 150 N.S.Welshmen and 40 Queenslanders.
