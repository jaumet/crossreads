<p>it didn't arrive sooner. We had stew for Break. It wasn't <u>bad</u>, but the very fact of it <u>being</u> stew turned a good many off it. The War Chest Club are making our stay as pleasant as possible by raining Fruit, Biscuits &amp; Smokes &amp; Daily Papers. The Military Rations are mighty scarce &amp; need augmenting. I got a Parcel &amp; Letter from B.E. during the afternoon. A jolly good Parcel &amp; very welcome, but the Letter was the <u>most</u> welcome. B.E. writes the most beautiful letters, &amp; then calmly says she wishes she could write as nice Letters as I do. Why mine are not a <u>patch</u> on hers. Gib &amp; I had a swim &amp; at night we went fishing, but didn't catch anything. It was glorious scrambling down the rocks, &amp; sitting on the Beach watching the Manly Boats go by. I wrote a Letter to B.E. during the Day also to Nell &am; Mother. I wonder what Luck they had in getting a Cottage. I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of <u>another</u> Letter now.<br/>Sat. Mar.29.<br/>Another Glorious Day. For Breakfast we had Mutton chops Bread, Jam &amp; coffee. After the Tent Parade "Gil" &amp; I scrambled down the rocks to the Beach, where we spent the morning splashing about in the water &amp; sunning ourselves on the Beach. It was great. The only thing to make it <u>perfect</u> would be to have B.E. here with me. I got another Letter from B.E. this morning, &amp; this afternoon I got a Parcel containing Home made Cake, Tinned Fruit, &amp;  cream &amp; a tin of "Soner" Tobacca. A real sensible Parcel. Didn't the crowd enjoy the cake, my word they soon made a mess of it. We have a good deal of "shop" cake lately but anything "Home-made" appeals to the crowd.  We spent the whole of the afternoon on the Beach, &amp; I feel deliciously tired tonight. The fellows are enjoying being here. To see them on the Beach, romping about on the sand, &amp; playing Leap Frog, etc, one would imagine they were a lot of Kids. Tomorrow I must write to Mother &amp; reply to the Letter she wrote to Lill &amp; me.</p>
