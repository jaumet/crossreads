 Glasgow is very much bigger than Edinburgh, & I like the place very much. Electric trams are the principal means of conveyance, & they are very cheap too, you can go a long way for halfpenny. There are some very fine buildings here, & the streets are nice & wide. One thing as struck me as being peculiar & that was, how the people have to line up in the streets to gain admittance into a picture show or a theatre, another was a threepenny & sixpenny shop, a place where everything is purchased at 3d. or 6d. or a quantity at the same price. Things are very cheap. 
 Everybody seems very obliging & sociable. I had a good look round Glasgow this afternoon on trams, at times walking. I also visited a wax works place which was not very interesting, especially to anyone with not too much money. It rained during the afternoon, & continued throughout the night. The Y.M.C.A. people are very good & obliging, money, valuable, & packs are taken care of without any extra charge. Some of the scotch people talk very broad here, at times I can hardly understand them. There are a good few Australians up here on leave.
