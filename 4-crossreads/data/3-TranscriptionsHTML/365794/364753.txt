<p>Saturday 15 December 1917<br/>Now what can one say of a day of sorrow?  Home letters rec'd and I can hardly grasp the facts yet that two people should be so evil.  No use writing these things it hurts too deeply.<br/>11.30 a.m. went A.G.H. No. 14 &amp; voted yes for conscription, saw Dick.<br/>Off duty 2-5 went town with S. Heathcote (nice girl).<br/>One pt. in Connaught tells a story of pt. adm. who had "cut his throat with bully beef tin and made a bad job of it".  Very unromantic that is.</p>
