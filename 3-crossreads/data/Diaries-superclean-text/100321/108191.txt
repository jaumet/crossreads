17/2/19 Cologne
A very wet rainy morning. After breakfast walked down to No. 4 Squadron AFC at Kaiser Wilhelm Platz and had a cup of tea with them. On the way back called in at St Gereon's church which dates from 1219 ? a heavy smell of incense. Gilding and sombre stained glass. Visited St Andreas church where a priest came in carrying the host from some sick bed. He was preceded by a boy with bell and censer. To St Marin Himmelfahrt which is large and has a fine carved pulpit. Enjoyed a quiet look round shop windows. In the streets there were many workers clothed in semi military garb. The streets and footpaths are kept beautifully clean and the whole city reflects great credit of its municipality.
