<p>soft and in nowhere near a fit state to march such a distance before breakfast, and at the same time carry our heavy kits which included the extra sea-kit. However we arrived at the camp in time for breakfast, every face looking as white as chalk with exhaustion after the march. Although the march was hard, it was interesting because it was the first walk in the English Daylight that I ever had in my life. The first thing I noticed was the smooth asphalt roads with a grove of trees on each side and the treetops meeting, forming a long green cave. This made the air very fresh and cool and it mainly accounts for the fact that we accomplished our first hard march.</p>
<p>Salisbury Plains was one mass of military Camps, and it accommodated thousands and thousands of troops, mostly troops from Australia, Canada and the southern counties of England. After having breakfast the morning we landed, we were allotted to the section of the huge Salisbury Camp known as Rollastone Camp. Rollastone was the farthest part of the Camp from the Railway Station but it was near a nice little village called Shrewton.<br/> I visited many of the neighbouring villages which are all very old fashioned and behind modern times. For instance many of the houses have thatched straw or reed roofs, with the eves neatly cut and trimmed at the edges, and then again when you visit a church you see the graveyard which, in almost every case, is in front of the Church.  "Stonehenge" which is of historical import, was within the camp boundary, and I visited it a few times. <br/>In our Camp there was a good deal of horse and wagon traffic, and of course the roads had to be kept in repair, this being done by the German prisoners of war under British Sentries, who were armed with loaded rifles. The prisoners were a curiosity to we boys who had not been in the trenches to see them, and we used to go over to their compound every Sunday afternoon, when they were resting and lying about the grounds inside the enclosure, and talk to them through the wires of the fence. We could not get close to the fence as the sentry would move us back.</p>
<p>The prisoners all looked well and in good condition and I hoped the Germans would treat the British prisoners the same.</p>
