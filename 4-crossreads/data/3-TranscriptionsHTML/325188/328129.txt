<p>The 2nd LH Bgde made a demonstration against the Ts Left (the Bgde is in on our [indecipherable] trench  right near the sea) so as to divert as many Turks when were slipping off to reinforce their mates at or near Achi Baba (south) The 5th Regt &amp; a Sqdn &amp; &frac12; of 7th Regt went out with the 9th Batt. Inf supported by some guns and got near what is called the Balkan Gun Pits &amp; started to dig in when they were shelled by our own Naval Guns who made a mistake. Our men retired as they had no orders to hold anything &amp; lost 20 killed &amp; 108 wounded. The Naval guns were responsible for half the casualties. Lt Gilchrist of the 7th L.H. died of wounds since &amp; one other is bad (6 officers wounded) The officer Comdg &amp; other officers of 2nd LH Bgde were congratulated by the Genl on the manner in which the affair was carried out the Queenslanders (5th LH) displayed great coolness in retiring &amp; Col Harris was congratulated.
