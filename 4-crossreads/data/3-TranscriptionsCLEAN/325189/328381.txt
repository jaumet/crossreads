Church Parade.  Struck tents & cleared up the Camp during the day.  Stan Cocking & I picked to go as baggage guard.  7.30 p.m. 6th bn. marched off for Cairo.  We went at 10 p.m. & reached the Central Rly. Stn. at 2 a.m.  This is 12 miles & as we were carrying full packs, & haversacks & rifles it was not bad going.  Our feet are tender after walking on the soft sand.  Train left Cairo.
