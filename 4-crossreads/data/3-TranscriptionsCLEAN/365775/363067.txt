You can for 5 or 10 francs buy a very desint champagne. at some of these places, then nearly every farm house, you can buy a glass of beer at one penny a glass. all these places are under the control of the police, both Military French & English, & are only allowed to open at certain times of the day, from 12 noon to 2 P.M. & 6 P.M.  8 P.M. failure to comply, they are put out of bounds to all british troops for a certain time & on second offence, duration of the war.
