<p>September, 1915<br/>Thursday 30<br/>We get little military news out here at the CASINO among the dancing girls one gets most news of the war. In Cairo there are Austrian, Italian, Greek, French, Russian etc. etc. One hears all the news, &amp; they know most of who is killed etc:- One girl worried our officers for the address of another Officer's wife as she wanted to write to her &amp; say how sorry he was killed &ndash; She thought that the wife would be glad to know someone loved her husband in a strange land. This is Bohemian if you like the poor kid meant nothing by it; but was really sorry. <strike>Went &amp; saw MARDI for a few minutes, she's as pretty as ever</strike></p>
