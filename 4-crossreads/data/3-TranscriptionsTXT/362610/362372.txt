 Monday 5 June 1916 A dull morning, leading to a very changeable showery day, though in all but little rain fell. There was a high wind &amp; no aeroplanes were visible during the day. As soon as breakfast was over got my gear packed up &amp; reported out to the Bomb School, &frac12; mile or so out of Sailly. Left the gear there &amp; then went back to the old billet for lunch, &amp; there being nothing to do during the afternoon went round to Leo &amp; with him walked out to Fleurbaix where Rid was stationed. On the way out passed numerous billets that had been shelled, there being plenty of shell-holes &amp; other evidences of Hun attention all along the road. The people were working in their fields just as if no war was going on. Found Rid after abt. a 4 mile walk &amp; in the same building, acting adjutant to the 2nd Brigade was Lt. Lindsey Cunningham. He remembered Leo &amp; me at once : after a cup of tea Rid took us round to one or two of the gun-pits but there was no firing going on. It was, however, very interesting to see the 18 pounders &amp; howitzers &amp; to see the shell holes made all round one of the batteries in a vain attempt by the Germans to get our guns. Walked home &amp; after tea reported out at the Bomb School to sleep.
