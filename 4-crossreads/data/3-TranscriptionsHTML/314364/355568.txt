<p>Mon. Mar. 19.<br/>The sea is not quite as rough this morning, but the wind is very keen &amp; the ship still rolling a bit. The Hosp. is filling up again; keeping us on the move. A chap named Roberts, from Manly came in last night. "Poss" &amp; I gave him an ananema, which "put the wind up him" somewhat. He is alright this morning.<br/>The rumour is that we are <u>not</u> going to Hobart from Adelaide, which will be a mighty good job if it's true, as it will bring Sydney a few days nearer. The Food continues good &amp; we manage to satisfy our patients; which is a big item. We have 8 malaria Patients in now, all "Gentleman of the Light Horse". They are a very decent crowd.<br/>Tues. Mar. [indecipherable]<br/>They say now that we are going to Hobart, but I'm hang if I know what to believe.</p>
