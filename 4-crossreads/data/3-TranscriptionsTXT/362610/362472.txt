Wednesday 13 Sept. 1916Again wet & miserable. The new brigade was taking over during the day but I did not bother much, feeling off colour & lying down most of the time. About 8.30 at night set off with Cuthbert from H.Q. & walked along the railway line, being just in time to catch the train, which fortunately was 15 minutes late. Only a very short run in it & then a march of abt. 3 mls. to 2nd Bn. H.Q. where we had a cup of tea & then came on the other 1 1/2 miles to our old Bde. H.Q., arriving cold & tired at a late hour. Bert Thompson called to see be during the morning.
