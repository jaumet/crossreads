  
 approached the coast & met with some misty & cool weather.  The train now slowed up considerably & we crawled through Boulogne & Calais without seeing much of either town however & eventually stopped at Theinnes 5.30. P.M. I was orderly Sergeant for the day & for the next two hours had plenty of running about.  An interpreter met us & showed us the billets provided.  They consisted of barns with plenty of straw for the men to sleep on.  We were all accomodated within a radius of 500 yards, 50 being in one barn 80 in another & so on.  Officers were billeted in houses & the Sergeants had a small barn to themselves who also arranged for a room in the village for the purposes of a mess.  It was amusing to listen to the attempts at French by various members of the party.  By 8 oclock all was fixed up, fatigue parties had unloaded waggons carried firewood for the cooks etc etc & all were happy.  An air raid could be seen by a large number of aeroplanes some distance away the puffs of shrapnel bursting all amongst them.  This same night we heard the guns booming for the first time.
