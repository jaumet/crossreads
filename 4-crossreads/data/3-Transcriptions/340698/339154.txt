<p>2 days and then do a stunt.</p>
<p>1/11/16<br/>Shifted camp to Flers.</p>
<p>We expect to go back to Delville wood but H.Q. only shifted a few hundred yards. We are camped in a cellar under the monastery. They shell the village every day.</p>
<p>2/11/16<br/>Still in Flers. Charge postponed owing to bad weather. All preparations</p>
