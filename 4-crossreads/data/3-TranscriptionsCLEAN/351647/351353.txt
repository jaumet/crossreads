Dear Mrs. Jack,
Of course you'll be calling me some of your high toned names & in a way I deserve it as it is quite weeks since I last wrote but I simply haven't had a show.  I simply had to let letters slide.
You see I had a big job on & simply had to go for dear life night and day.
Had eight assistants, had six of them in a big dug out & 2 down here (where I sleep) & as I had to slave drive to get the job finished I couldn't sort of set a bad example & write letters or the staff would have started reckoned it was an easy job & started writing letters too & it would have taken weeks to finish.  It rather worried me & I used to feel rather dead every morning.
However the work is practically over, 6 of the assistants have departed, some I'm afraid with bitter thoughts towards me as I lost my temper at times & said biting & sarcastic remarks.  Just blew off at them so to speak.
