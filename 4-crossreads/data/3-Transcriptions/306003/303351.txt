<p>We put the horse lines down had dinner &amp; few minutes sleep under the saddle blankets for a shade &amp; then set to work to erect the tent &amp; put the camp ship shape;  We were issued with a bottle of fresh water each this afternoon &amp; it is quite a treat after what we have been drinking since we arrived;  The Interpreters were going to be left behind at Minia but the H.Q. Interpreter is a bit of hard doer &amp; is out for adventure &amp; asked to be allowed to come with us, so both the others had to come also</p>
