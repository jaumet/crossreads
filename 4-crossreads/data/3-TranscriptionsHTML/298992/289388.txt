<p>of her letters. I never thought that when I was up saying good-bye to her, that it would be really "good-bye". It made me quite sad, because they had all given me such a good time when I was home, and I was looking forward to seeing her again. Dorothy's letter was very funny. At the end of it, 3 others had a say as well "love from".</p>
<p>I've done it! Simply couldn't help it, it was so easy. Gone and got a couple of stripes, and am now Pay Corporal of the 10th of 13th. There is plenty of work attached to it, and one has to have all their wits about them when dealing with the money matters. It is all in piastres (81/2d), and reckoning up the amounts in English &amp; Egyptian cause a good deal of worry. However the pay is 10/- a day instead of 6/- and no more tramping in the sand any more, quite counterbalance the extra work that has to be done.</p>
<p>Have no time to write more just now, and will only send some of the photos as they are fairly bulky, the others I shall send next mail.</p>
<p>Tell Rollo to write a letter to me, and I am looking forward to getting one from you. Tell Dene to write and tell me all about his trip. Lots of Love to you all &ndash;</p>
