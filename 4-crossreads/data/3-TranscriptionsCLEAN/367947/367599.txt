  
 Our horses are in good nick & get well looked after. The desert sun is very hot but we have managed to get a little shelter rigged here & there, which proves a great boon. Rations are good as can be & we are having a real good turn. Of course we've earned it. 
 I've got three splendid nags & you can bet we're good pals. I've picked up a good knowledge of horses here & do some enjoyable rides. We are too far from the canal for swimming but will get a turn there bye & bye. 
 There have been one or two stunts of which the papers will have published in detail ere this. A week or so ago an aeroplane flew over one of the L.H. camps & dropped fifteen bombs accounting for 9 men & 14 horses killed. It was "No man standing" for a few jiffs. Of course he caught them at stables so was able to do a double shift & get away. 
 The desert is not very interesting from a physical aspect, but it is marvellous to see the wonderful hiding places to be found everywhere in it. Everything is sand & the wind makes some tremendous mounds & some equally tremendous hollows. I have seen hollows quite two hundred feet deep.
