Went over to the farm in the afternoon. Spent a very pleasant hour there. On our way two Fritzs came over and dropped a few aerial torpedoes. One dropped in the field next our station. Another dropped in amongst a Brass Band which was playing, killing a few and wounding others.

A French Belgian youth was brought in, terribly wounded. He died before anything could be done for him. His was a pathetic case as nearly all his fathers family had been wiped out by violence during the war. A brother & sister left out of six.

Hop picking is a very tedious job. The farmers canâ€™t get employees to pick hops so they have to set to and do a bit themselves.

Very hot during the day but cool and dull in the evening.

The system which they have in the operating theatre is not good. It does not give the staff a fair chance.

Had a busy night in the O.T. Assisted at two abdominal Operations. One of these had been caused by a sentry putting a bayonet into a chap for not replying to a challenge. He had twelve perforations in his intestines

[Written at left hand side of entry:] This case turned out wonderful

Took a walk out to Steenje. Plenty of brambles, haws etc. The country is lovely. Autumn is spreading her golden stores and the lovely tints on the trees is something to remember.
