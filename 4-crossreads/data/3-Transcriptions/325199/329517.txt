<p>Friday July 7. 1916.<br/>It is very hot today. The Captain &amp; ships officers on their tour of Inspection came down in their white suites &amp; the Army officers in light uniform. I slept above last night on top of the cooke house. It was very depressing below.</p>
<p>The course today is 7 points West of North with a very gentle breeze from the South which makes it much cooler.</p>
<p>Two large steamers passed us on the Port side this morning. One of them being H.M.S. Kent. She was about a quarter of a mile away and signalled with a large mirror which flashed the Morse code. She wished us "good Luck".</p>
<p>This is washing day. There is a shortage of water and N.C.O's of D. Company were instructed to supervise the washing in order that none should be wasted.</p>
<p>Saturday July 8. 1916.<br/>It is very hot today. The wind is from the S.East which tempers the heat somewhat. Judging from the Sun the course is apparently the same. [Following shorthand is not transcribed.]</p>
