One runner detailed to carry a message came down the steps in a pitiful condition, he had lost his boots and hat and was in a sweating played out condition. Ration parties had a hard task in taking up the rations and Wicks later came in covered with mud and about deadbeat. Pedler in charge and wearing his crown. Only a few odd shells landing.
