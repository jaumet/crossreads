 Your letter has helped in no small degree to tinge our sorrow with sweetness and I hope with you that our country may prove worthy of the sacrifice these gallant young men are making by so willingly yielding up their sweet and precious lives in her service.  Arthur and Ivan are now in the Elysian fields in the company of the happy warriors.  They have fought the great fight and gained the crown.  They have gone to the higher and further service
