<p>VI  The Somme once again &ndash; Villers Brettoneux.<br/>After 2 days at Reninghelst the Battalion moved southwards by train &ndash; a tedious journey as usual but the monotony was considerably relieved by the excitement at the time, all were warned to be ready for instant action. At Doullens the battalion detrained &amp; marched 10 miles by night to the village of Arqueves.  'D' Coy however travelled in a separate train &amp; detrained at Mondicourt.  At Arqueves the whole battalion rested but were under orders to be ready to move at one hours notice &ndash; consequently no transport could be unloaded.  Regular parades were held when possible to keep everyone fit.  While at Arqueves an unfortunate accident occurred resulting in the death of Lt. R.W. Palmer.<br/>This village was picqueted every night to limit the action of spies &amp; one escaped German prisoner was thus captured.  On Apr 5th the battalion moved on very short notice by motor bus thro' Amiens to the village of Daours on the somme; thence by march to Blangy- [Trouville?] where they billeted.  The battalion lost no time in reconnoitring the Divisional area so as to be prepared for emergencies.  Work was commenced by burying 2&frac12; miles of cable 3ft 6 ins deep in one day &amp; next in establishing roads across the marshes alongside the river to provide means of retreat should such action be necessary.  1000 yds of corduroy road was thus built.  Trench systems were next tackled and a series of strong posts being first dug which were subsequently connected.  The battalion's camp was shelled on the evening of Apl 17th &amp; that same evening detachments on duty guarding road mines in the village of Villers-Brettoneux were gassed &amp; had to be replaced.  Owing to a slight change in the Divisional sector the battalion moved to near the village of Bussy les Daours &amp; dug in on a large bank on the slopes of the R[iver] Hallue.  Trench digging was still the order of the day until Apl 24th when the battalion was kept in readiness for instant action owing to the capture of the village of Villers Brettoneux by the Germans fortunately for one day only.
