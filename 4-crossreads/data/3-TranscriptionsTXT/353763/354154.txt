knows but what trouble may yet arise in the island & all necessary military precautions are to be taken  -  I need hardly say the town is strongly occupied by the military  -  One nigger - a fine buck - had a most swagger of light colored felt hat turned well up on one side a la Tommie  -  He had a colored loin cloth but that wasn't the lot - on his right arm was a band & fixed in that was the true  symbol of the a higher civilization - a tooth brush  -  He - at least - was serene & composed & equal to any emergency  -  I saw a native police man - on Sentry go at a hatch  -  He looked - rifle & all - a most imposing figure - like an Indian Sepoy Talking of natives - we heard that the Germans had trained & armed a native police & at the Kagakaul Scrap they were up in the trees in the dense scrub & potted our chaps  -  When their turn came wouldn't their fall be sudden!!
