 Bapaume 19/3/17 Dull and chilly.  200 of our men at work road repairing just outside here.  Furphey (afterwards confirmed) that we are moving back to Bazentin tonight.  After some breakfast of bacon and army biscuit I went out the back way &amp; walked across a green paddock to the neat hedge encircle civil cemetery which has been used by the Germans for their burials as well.  There were many gold lettered neat stones for dead officers and many wooden crosses for the numerous soldiers buried in common graves  In the centre of the cemetery there is a large monument to the French soldiers who fell in 1870 and not far from it the Germans have erected an even more imposing one to the memory of their dead in 1914 &ndash; 5. 
 Thiepval seems to have been where a lot of them fell.  The ground round here is pastoral and free of shell holes.  Fritz has been living in clover compared to us.  Our men today are digging vegetables out of the many fields around.  In the cemetery are some 23rd men and beyond the town in a paddock is another grave.
