 Dear Madam, 
 In reply to your letter of 28th July  1918 in which you make a request for a photo of the grave of Private T. Bell and the grave of Private T. Bell who is buried a point just North North West of Hangard, south of Corbie and whose grave is fully registered in this office, and marked by a durable wooden cross bearing his name, rank, regiment, and date of death. I regret to have to inform you that at the present time it is not possible to take any photographs in this area. 
 A note, however, has been made of your application, and when it is possible to operate in the area referred to, a photograph will be taken and the desired number of copies sent to you as soon as possible thereafter. 
 Yours faithfully,
