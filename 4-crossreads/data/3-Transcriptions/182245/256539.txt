<p>24 WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny &amp; fairly warm in</p>
<p>the sun. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>all day. There was a lot of</p>
<p>aircraft about &amp; they were</p>
<p>firing at them all day but</p>
<p>did not bring any down as far</p>
<p>as I could see. Our section</p>
<p>was on duty, but could not</p>
<p>get any ammunition to</p>
<p>take up, so we did not have</p>
<p>to go out. Got some more</p>
<p>socks ect from 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Bde</p>
<p>comfort fund. I was on</p>
<p>stable picket at night.</p>
