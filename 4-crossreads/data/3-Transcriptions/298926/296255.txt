<p>Every time the battalion is on Parade, the Major after calling the Parade to attention he <br/>always finishes with roaring "Stand steady the band".  At a concert the other night given <br/>mainly by bandsmen, the Major acted as chairman and gave a song. <br/> Every now and then some of the men would sing out "Stand Steady the Band" but the <br/>Major only smiled and took it in good part.<br/>Our doc. is a good old sport.  Every time we play at the officer's mess he shouts us a <br/>drink and gives us boxes of 20 "Greys" (Cigs)</p>
