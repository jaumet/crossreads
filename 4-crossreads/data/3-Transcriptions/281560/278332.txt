<p>7/12/16.<br/>Spent the day loafing at Willow Siding. There is a big gun on the railway not far away. When it fires one feels the ground tremble about five seconds before the report is heard. It is a 9.2, and has a range of about 15 miles.<br/>10/12/16.<br/>During the last three days, we constructed a large drain. It is about three miles long. Some drain. There is rain every day. I collected several books from vacant dugouts the first I have seen for years.<br/>11/12/16.<br/>The company has been re-organised and I have been selected as a "wire cutter"; a specialist of the first wave. I view these preparations with disfavour. Was</p>
