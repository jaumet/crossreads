<p>Wednesday 5 July 1916<br/>A lovely fine day. Plenty of cherries were supplied to us during the day &amp; we had a really good "feed". Parades were held in the morning &amp; afternoon, the first since the company went into the line, so that the men were pretty rusty. Good progress was, however, made.</p>
