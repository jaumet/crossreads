<p>for bed.   During the day there was a heavy bombardment of a position 1500 yards from us where some heavy guns were situated.   It was very picturesque &amp; rather alarming as the shells went screaming over our heads.   Damage done, 2 men laid out.   The shells on landing sent up a fine shower of earth &amp; when they landed in the water the column of water was very pretty.   Added to that a shrapnel shell burst just to the rear of the Hospital giving us all rather a shock.  It was strange to see the men shrink up &amp; many of them duck into dugouts when the shell was heard approaching. 'Tis a sensible thing to do however.   The funniest episode of all happened during the afternoon.   We had just "fallen in" &amp; the shells had just stopped when four heavy blasts occurred on the cliff front just 10 yards in front of us &amp; earth &amp; small stones fell all around of us left.   Some bolted at the first bang &amp; so on till the fourth when not a man was standing in his original place &amp; some were hundreds of yards away.   It was nothing but the Egyptians blasting some rock to build a new pier.   But to return.   We embarked in two motor Ambulances, which took us 3 miles on our way, about 11 oclock</p>
