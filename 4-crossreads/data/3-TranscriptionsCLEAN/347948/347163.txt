  
 Sing and wake now Thy sweet lute's soft numbers Lull me to rest Charm my sorrows away Oh charm - sorrows away O sing and charm - sorrows away Lull me to rest Give me your smile' The lovelight in your eyes Life could not hold a fairer paradise Give me the right to love you all the while My world for ever, The sunshine of your smile.
