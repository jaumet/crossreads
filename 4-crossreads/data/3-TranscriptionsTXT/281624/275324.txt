 Tuesday 2nd May  Since we have been here I have had no less than eight new patients making a total of over seventy eight men.  I am very busy and needlessly so for I am the only AMC man doing it in the camp, all others sent to Hospital. 
 Wednesday 3rd May   Every morning I have to take men to hospital down to No 2 stationary Hospital at Tel-el-Kebir.  About eight p m two rifle shots were heard and a man came running into our camp, he was immediately pounced on.  Two of them had escaped from the barbed wire prison at the back, one got away. 
 Thursday 4th May   With another I rode over to the famous Battle ground of Tel-el-Kebir.  It is an interesting sight of the British victory of 1882.  Skulls and graves are everywhere and we got some interesting curios.  The trenches are obsolete and would be easily taken with modern methods, we then rode over to a native village and did not get back to camp until 8 pm. 
 Friday 5th May   Busy finishing inoculations, good news from all fronts this war.  More troops arriving from Australia. 
 Saturday 6th May   Smallpox has broken out in the 11th Regt adjoining us and consequently all ranks have to be inoculated.  The Dr is doing MO work of both regiments. Our horses are looking very badly owing to the Colonel galloping them, he is very hard on horses and drills like a maniac 
 Sunday 7th May  Vaccinating all day, every man was examined.  The heat was stifling and I was glad to get out of the tent. The rest of the regs arrived back in camp from town picquet. 
 Monday 8th  Finished vaccinating regs to-day  I am very anxious about my brother in France I have not heard a word from him since he left
