<p>Thur. May 24th  5 years today Lill left England   Father's Birthday &amp; Empire Day.  Snowy &amp; I went to Southend.  It was a Perfect Day.  We arrived Southend about midday.  Aunt Pudney was surprised to see me.  We had a good Dinner there.  Mr Pudney made us feel quite at Home.  Olive is a very nice Girl.  Mrs Pudney &amp; I adjourned to the sitting room, where we had a great old yarn about Lill.  She showed me her photo Album, in which I saw Lill Absolom as a Kid.  What a bonnie Kid she was too.  Florrie is married to a sergeant in the Flying Corps.  She is almost as good looking as her cousin.  Snowy &amp; I went for a stroll around the Town.  It was very quiet.  Mrs P wanted us to stay overnight, but we couldn't spare the time.  Went to a photographers to get my picture taken, but he was out.</p>
<p>Fri. May 25th   Went to Southampton.  Got there about 2 oclock.  Aunt Nell was not a bit surprised to see me, as she said she had expected me so long.  It is a very nice part of the suburb in which she lives &amp; a very pretty cottage &amp; Garden.  I showed my collection of pictures  She (like everyone else) quiet fell in Love with Lill; &amp; asked me how I managed to win such a nice little Wife &ndash; but that is a mystery.  I don't know myself.  She must miss Uncle Stewart very much.  I had a scrumptious Tea.  Ate about 2 lbs of Lovely Home made Cake.  Aunt Nell gave me what was left to bring away.  Snowy Atherton soon made a mess of it &ndash; ably assisted by C.W. &amp; Bunny.  She was quite put out because I couldn't stay overnight, but Lord, what can a man do in 10 days?</p>
