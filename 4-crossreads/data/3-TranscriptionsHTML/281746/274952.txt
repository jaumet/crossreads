<p>We passed through charming country to-day.  The largest town we passed was Dijon which we reached at 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Sept 28th<br/>When we awoke early this morning we found ourselves at a place called [Saint] Germaine au Mont D'Or.  We left the train at this part and were marched a short distance to a well conducted rest camp where we had breakfast and a hot bath.  A few managed to get the hold of some liquor and made fools of themselves.  Saw some troops coming back from Eastern parts.  They looked physical wrecks.  <br/>Left Germaine au Mont D'Or at 12 mid day.  Next stop 20 kilos away and is the city of Lyons.<br/>At this station most of the troops amused themselves throwing pennies, cigarettes, etc. to children on to the streets below the station.  This was the cause of a great deal of sport.<br/>We then went rapidly through most charming country by river, hill &amp; dale.  At some parts we ran parallel with the wide river Rhone.<br/>When I passed this way two and half years ago it was spring time, now it is autumn and the trees have taken on their varied autumn tints instead</p>
