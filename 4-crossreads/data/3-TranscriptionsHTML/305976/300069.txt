<p>Sunday Oct 27th<br/>We were told today that the Division lost 50 &#37; of its strength. We hear we are moving back on Nov 1. The Sherif of Mecca's forces are camped at different places here in Syria &amp; it is said they are taking over full control. The inhabitants hate them so there is sure to be some trouble.<br/>Monday Oct 28<br/>We are preparing to move. Some Indians have arrived to take over Possy. The Sherif Mecca representative was in town to day where there was a ceremony preparatory to its handing over.</p>
