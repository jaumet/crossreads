  
 Sunday 4 February 
 Into Albert again this morning.  Last night a Fritz aeroplane came across and dropped bombs round our camp.  He  spe  swept hospital tents with machine gun fire, but fortunately there were no patients in the tents.  One chap was firing at the airman with a rifle and got into trouble for doing so.
