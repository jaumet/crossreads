<p>Saturday 31 March</p>
<p>Up at 10 a.m.  Cold wind blowing all day.<br/>By getting up late we save a meal and therefore make the most of the very short rations.  There isn't really enough for two meals a day.<br/>Went up to Beaulencourt for rations this afternoon.<br/>All 8th Field Ambulance bearers are now coming to Beaulencourt, leaving the 15th Fld. Amb. to work out from Bapaume.<br/>The 14th Field Amb. are going out of action in two days time.</p>
