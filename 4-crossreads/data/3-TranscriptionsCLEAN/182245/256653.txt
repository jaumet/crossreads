18 FRIDAY
Fine & fairly warm. Out exercising
horses in morning & cleaning
harness in afternoon Fritz
sent a few big shells (
probably 10 inch) very near
our waggon lines & in
evening he came over &
tried to get the ballon
practically over our heads
but he missed it first
go & did not try again. I got
a letter from mother.
We had a turn out about
1 AM & did not get back till
about six oclock.
