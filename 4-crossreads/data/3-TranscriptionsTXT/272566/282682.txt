To "K" Supply ColumnTo 1st Anzac Corps Headquarters.To A.D.M.S. Ypres via PoperingheNote  Though in most cases I only mention A.D.M.S. when in reality I mean 5th Div. Hd. Q., it may be stated here that I have to take returns to the Asst. Director of Medical Services.  This is the all important factor of each trip, but in addition I also have despatches for The 5th Div. Paymaster, The Veterinary Officer, The Engineers, etc. & various despatches to be sent via D.R.L.S.
