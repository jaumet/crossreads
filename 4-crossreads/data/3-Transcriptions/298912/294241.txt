<p>On arrival at Bab-el-Louke railway station we had missed the 12.45 am train, so we had to doss on the station. I pulled down two boxes &amp; turned in &amp; slept till about 3 am when it became bitterly cold &amp; I could only shiver. At last the "Hopeless dawn broke" &amp; I found that a native had been piling blocks of ice alongside that certainly did not warm things . At 5.30 am the train drew out &amp; we arrived a few minutes later at Ma'adi where we again turned out &amp; had to walk another mile with the packs &amp; gear arriving at the Ma'di Light Horse Camp at 6.00 am</p>
