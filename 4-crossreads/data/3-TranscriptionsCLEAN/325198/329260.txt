3 March, 1916SerapeumThis is the worst place I have ever been in to do any writing, the tent is always crowded & it is so windy & dusty that it is almost impossible to write in it.  To night I am writing down at the canteen it seems a bit quieter here & there is a good light & a seat.  These last two days have been particularly windy & the sand gets into every thing. I don't know how much of it we must eat with our food. We have taken our dinner out these last few days & indeed it is much better than having it in the tents as we dismount for dinner where there is a bit of a break in the desert & it is not so bad.
