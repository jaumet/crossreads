Reading The Governors by Phillips Oppenheim
29th MAY MON 1916. Romani.
Have been busy all day with these supernumaries. And tonight 6 men went out with night outposts They remain on duty until 5 30 tomorrow and as soon as they come in two are to go out immediately with a photographer: Modern warfare indeed. The remainder are to get out of bed at 3 AM. And feed their horses and have a drink of tea which will be prepared and at 4 A.M they go out with a Squadron on day patrol At present I cannot see how on earth we are to go on like this we are down to the last signaller and we have none to call upon, we are hoping for reinforcement signallers to come from our base details at Tel El Kebir. If about 2 or 3 of them go to hospital then we are in "some" fix. I suppose the only thing to do under the Circumstances is to muddle through somehow we have been in tighter places before.
