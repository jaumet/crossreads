<p>from Dorothy.  Poor kid I hope she will not be sea-sick.  I wish I had been with them but suppose something is in store for us.</p>
<p>Do you ever see or hear from Mr Tom Newton?  If so remember me to him &amp; tell him Dorothy &amp; I are separated once more.</p>
<p>Suppose Charity has told you the news by now.  I had a nice letter from her a few weeks ago &amp; one from her hubby the last mail.   Hope she has good luck &amp; everything goes well with her.</p>
<p>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving sister<br/>Edith.</p>
