At Gezira we have 52 Natives working &amp; also an infantry guard of 16. Spent my  first  second afternoon (first at Alexandria) with a Troop of Scouts since leaving Sydney - in the Y.M.C.A. sports grounds at Gezira. Moored to the banks of the Nile are a number of old steamers used as House boats by English people &amp; others during the hot months. From 8.30 to 10.30 was on the Nile with a Patrol Leader in a Marakeb (Arabic for boat). It was fine.
