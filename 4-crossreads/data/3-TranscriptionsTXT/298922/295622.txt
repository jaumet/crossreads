 Monday 19th November 1917 
 Embarked at noon S.S. "Malta" at last. Very careful inspection of PASSPORTS etc:-  Went down the Thames &amp; anchored &ndash; for night. Not a big ship, &amp; only 8 other women on board. "Dolly" wears her Red X Brassard. 
 Boat drill etc., we are at the Doctor's Table for meals. 
 All luggage safe on board, thank goodness!  I believe we have several hundred barrels of gunpowder also so we should have a good lift if hit.
