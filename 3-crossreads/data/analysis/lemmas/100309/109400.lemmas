 12/6/17 Pari but we had not the time . From here we had a veri pleasant round run to St Germain en Lay which rise in big wooden bluff abov the Sein and domin Pari . The German batteri were here dure the sieg of ?70 . a fine old castl done by Francoi most . We drove home pass close to the well known Valerien Mount which is strong fortifi . Dine at Metier in good comfort had a soup , some frog , asparagus , ice a benedictin some wine item 14 frs . Return to hotel and spent a pleasant even tete-a-tet on the balconi and then went up to room , where the peopl next door prove rather interest with nois action . As result of today tour I am inclin to think that Pari is set in a forest .
