<p>reinforcements such as Carmichaels thousand would remake the battalion. Their R.M.O. is now with us also all their medical supplies.<br/>Thursday 26th Sept<br/> Usual W.O. duties, taking parade, making up rolls etc. Excellent news of Palestine, over 40,000 prisoners, said to be a fourth of the total Turkish forces, a great stroke for Allenby. The 54th.Battalion matter has been settled, the heads giving away &amp; now I have to send their medical gear  back after I had distributed it. Some nuisance. The RMO &amp; other officers return to the Battalion in the morning &amp; I hope this giving way will not have a bad affect on our discipline. We may move now at any moment.<br/>Friday 27th Sept.<br/> Had a busy day fixing up the move. At 10 A.M. sent 40 men to the battalions &amp; then arranged  remaining bearers into Squads etc. At 2P.M. sent of remaining bearers &amp; completed loading of transport, filling watercarts etc. Troops moving up all day. Tea at 4.30. Parade at 5P.M> &amp; had all pits filled, camp cleaned etc. &amp; men all ready in full</p>
