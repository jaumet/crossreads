<p>resuming our work L.Cpl. Hall was slightly wounded in the arm, so we collared a Fritz &amp; made him work in our squad.  He was a middle aged man &amp; worked well &amp; he enjoyed sharing rations with us. All through the day we had Fritz prisoners carrying the wounded to the cars.  If we had not done this our four squads would have never coped with the rush.  It was close to 7 p.m. before the work eased down a little.  It was told by an officer that the Fritzes who were using the machine guns so deadly were surrounded, they immediately yelled out "mercy Comrades" but needless to say they received no mercy. Darkness had set in before all the wounded were got away. An exciting incident occurred about 6 oclock, one of our Balloons was brought down in flames, &amp; fell in the sunken road. Luckily for us it just missed falling on some ammunition. We had a fine job putting the fire out as it would never do to let the balloon burn, and draw the enemy's fire. Half a mile from the road was a train that was captured with 600 German soldiers in it, during the early morning. Attached to the train was a tremendous gun which had been firing on one of the biggest towns in France.  At 10 p.m.</p>
