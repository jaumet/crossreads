<p>It's fine marching to a good band, which plays intermittently all day. I don't think it was here when Alan was here. Who do you think sleeps next to me? Fraser Harvie. The tent load is not a bad lot and we hope to get two Army Med Recruits shifted into Jim's tent. One is a man named Riley a B D.Sc. of Sydney who went through with Olly and thinks a lot of Olly. Tell Olly this. The drill so far consists of 6 &frac12;  hours marching a day, but as I was orderly I was going hard all day. Well, there is nothing to related so far. Don't write to me till I know where I am stationed unless you write to C/o Salvation Army.</p>
