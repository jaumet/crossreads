 of admir for those old peopl whose monument alon are the testimoni of their great , and who themselv have becom as the desert sand . Yet here the pyramid stand , untouch by time , and as indestruct as the veri sand which surround them . And there is the Sphinx . Gaze in solemn silenc into the futur , into the rise sun , and behind it the throng age which day are countless as the desert sand . And what I thought as I gaze into that pensiv stare face , are all those crowd year , compar with etern ? Whi was ever man creat to live but for a moment ? Sure such object as these can alon convey some slight impress to the sens of Time and Space . Kingdom rise and fall , Nation becom but name , but still the Sphinx gaze on , heedless , inscrut , and unwrinkl .
