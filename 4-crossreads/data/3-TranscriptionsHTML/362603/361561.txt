<p>Bulford<br/>12/12/17<br/>Dear Mum Dad &amp; George,<br/>I intended writing on Sunday but it was a nasty dreary day so I went over to Durrington for a walk in the afternoon.  I went to a Lady's House.  She keeps a small restaurant for Soldiers.  I played the piano for a couple of Hours, had Tea &amp; was Home again about 5 p.m.  Ellis set out with me but after half a mile He said this is no good to me.  It's too cold &amp; windy but I went on as I wanted a bit of training for Hockey.  I am feeling very fit.  We have had 4 or 5 practise games &amp; I don't get stiff or hardly raise a sweat.  The Bike got me into fine nick.  Although I am so fit &amp; have been doing a lot of cycling &amp; walking I turn the scale at 10 st 12 lbs.  English climate must agree because I never went over 10st 4 lbs in Australia.  Ellis &amp; I are playing Hockey with our Officers against the Officers of the whole Garrison to-morrow.  I am pleased at being selected but I am afraid that Ellis &amp; I are not chosen for merit, but because the Captain of the Officers team is a very personal Friend.  There are many better players in our Team as there aught to be seeing this is our first attempt &amp; that no left-handed play is allowable in Hockey so Ellis has to do everything the opposite way &amp; finds it very hard.  I went to Salisbury on the Bike yesterday.  It was an absolutely perfect day.  Dad will be surprised at this.  I think the weather is</p>
