Some day I hope to have a son to carry on his name. X<br/>Every precaution is taken to reduce Malarial, all ranks issued with Mosquitoe Nets-  Gauntlet Gloves for night Patrols   All streams banked up to prevent shallow bywashes etc but evacuations are many.<br/>Great success on left 3500 prisoners &amp; we advanced 15 miles along coast.<br/>Our job is the Jordan side but Cables tell you all this long ere you get my notes-   Feel a bit off colour today</p>
