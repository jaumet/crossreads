no onions - no potatoes!!! We got 2 bucket fulls from the Elax & they're the first we've had since Dec 14th. You couldn't buy a bottle of lime juice ashore for gold - I tried yesterday -I had a good walk up to the Governor's residence & back by the Chinese quarter - My friend asked me if I'd like to see a Japanese House of ill fame - We went & were warmly greeted with a hand shake from 3 nicely dressed - very clean looking Jap - girls - I inspected them & their sitting room & one bedroom. All was clean & in good order & so far as I know they were in good health. You buy one for 10 marks - Officer's price - 5 marks - Soldier or Sailor -They were dressed in Jap fashion, nice Kimonos & Skirts & Sandals - nothing
