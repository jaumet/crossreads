 us we had to hold the trench to the last man as he had brought up all the men he had   &amp; the Turks were about 5 to 1.  They rushed our trenches but the boys hopped up on the parapet to get a better aim   &amp; fired till their rifles were too hot to hold, then the machine guns wiped whole lines of them out.  They lost about 4000 men while we had very few casualties that day.  I was hit about a month afterward by a shell which burst near our gun in the trench.  I did not see or hear of my friend Sid Stout since.  Saw Norman Sherwin a couple of times while on the Peninsula before I left.  While on furlough in England I went to see Aunt Marnie   &amp; Bell  &amp; stayed a few days &ndash; they were awfully nice.  I also went to Killarney before leaving Ireland which was beautiful. Well good bye for now with love to all from Your affectionate Nephew Charlie
