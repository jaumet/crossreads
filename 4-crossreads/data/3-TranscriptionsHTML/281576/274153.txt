<p>Mon. Nov. 13  It was at the 5th Dump I got 'em &amp; while there I met "Tiny O'Brien" &amp; [indecipherable] who were in the next tent to me at Liverpool.  The first thing they said was "How's the wife?" so I must tell old B.E. that next time I write.  After Dinner we went to the Baths, where we got rid of some of our "Big Game".  Gee! What a treat it was to take off our chatty shirts &amp; get under a hot shower, to soap ourselves all over, then have a good rub down with a dry towel &amp; put on a clean shirt.  It was glorious.  First decent wash we've had for months.  Billsy May went away this morning to "Blighty".  We gave him a hearty send off.  He was one big smile.  Gave him my diary to post to Aunt Nell, also a Letter to post to M.S.  The nightly issue of Rum is always very welcome.  It makes a good night cap before retiring for the night.</p>
<p>Tues. Nov 14  The Bombardment has been terrific this last few days.  Our Guns are sending it over to Fritz hot &amp; strong, night &amp; day, without ceasing.  Most of us are suffering from Headaches &amp; no bloomin' wonder.  After Break. we went into Albert. Doherty, Deed, Jackson, 12 of us in all where we demolished old houses &amp; loaded the bricks on to waggons   We worked in the shadow of the Church &amp; the Infant Jesus (in the arms of the Virgin Mary) hung almost over our heads.  It seems a terrible thing that such a beautiful piece of work should be knocked about by the Huns.  The 5th F.A. sent us out some Tea &amp; stew for Dinner, in a motor, but most of it got spilled on the way &amp; we got very little.  Got back to Camp in time for Tea, which consisted of a dry Biscuit &amp; a drink of Tea.  The Rum issue out out too.  Thank the Lord I got 2 letters from M S tonight  which made life worth living again.</p>
