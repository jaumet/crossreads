<p>Friday 1 March<br/>"March comes in like a lion", snowing, raining etc.  We moved to-day to Kemmell, Main Dressing Station.  The village is certainly knocked about, but nothing in comparison to villages on the Somme.  We move up to the line to-morrow but I think things will be quiet.</p>
<p>Saturday 2 March<br/>Move up to a cross roads, locally known as the Brasserie, on the Ypres road &amp; camp in dugouts in the brewery.  We are a little north of Wycheate.  The A.D.S. is about 1&frac12; miles further on &amp; I believe very comfy.  The weather is cold, wet &amp; miserable, snowing off &amp; on.  We go to the A.D.S. tomorrow on fatigue work. Heavy bombardment last night in consequence of a raid by Fritz in which we lost many men killed, etc. &amp; "he" was successful.</p>
