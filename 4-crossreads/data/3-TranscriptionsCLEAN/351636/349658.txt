  
 The Centre (nr. G.P.O) Soldiers Wives & Mothers 92B. Pitt Street 21st August 1915 
 Dear Mrs. Jamieson, We should be glad if you could come & see us at the Centre next Thursday afternoon - We could then talk over things - It is more satisfactory than exchanging letters. 
 Yours faithfully E. M. Wallack
