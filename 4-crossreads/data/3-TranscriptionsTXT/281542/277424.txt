 The dining hall was artistically decorated with palms &amp; the Australian flag, &amp; the main corridors leading to the wards were also resplendent with bunting &amp; greenery.  The piazza also was  a scene of greenery  appropriately decorated.  In fact, everything was in perfect harmony with the  occasion  spirit of the day. 
 The tables at dinner were loaded with good things, &amp; at each man's place a small card was laid on which was printed "The Australian Branch British Red Cross wishes you a merry Xmas &amp; a happy New Year &amp; a speedy recovery". 
 Major Norton, O.C. spoke a few words &amp; wished the men the Seasons greetings &amp; every happiness &amp; good cheer.  He stated that nothing had pleased him more than to have had the opportunity of sleeping under the same roof with such a splendid lot of fellows. 
 Three cheers were called for the Major &amp; heartily given.  A "jolly good fellow" was also given, to which the Major suitably responded.  God Save the King was sung with all standing, the men drinking their King's health with orange ale, lemonade, &amp; ginger beer.
