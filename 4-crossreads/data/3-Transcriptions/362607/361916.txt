<p>Dear Mother George &amp; Dad, This is another familiar place for us. On the left is Esbe Kiah [Esbekiah] Gardens &amp; right opposite to this statue is Kodak's where we usually get our Films developed. The Building right behind the Statue is the Opera House but I have never been inside. We are anxiously awaiting our mail which was sent on to England by mistake. We are getting quite used to the heat. This is July 1 &amp; we have not had a real bad day yet &amp; this June has been one of the hottest for years. We have not had any cold since we went into Camp so we might to be able to stand the heat. I was paid today so I am going to Heliopolis to see the pictures. I only pat for about 2 lemonades at 1 P.T. each &amp; see all the Pictures free. I must go to dinner now. We only lunch at mid-day. Love to all of You From Ellis &amp; Harry.</p>
