 Spent the morning chatting over his experiences &amp; of home &amp; time soon passed.  The nurse dressed the wound in my presence and wound was quite a small one but looked clean.  It looked suspiciously close to the ankle joint. Dinner at Llewellyn Caf&eacute; thence to Y.M.C.A. where I wrote to home &amp; M.B. explaining full facts re bro's wound.  Thence to Hospital again laden with plums etc. and spend the afternoon chatting. 
 Swansea 
 Tea in Neath thence to Swansea by 6.45 train &amp; booked room in Y.M.C.A. in St. Helens Rd. &ndash; an excellent building.  Walk thro' town to beach.  Saw the extraordinary Mumbles Express &amp; also Mumbles Beach.  Back to Y.M.C.A. at 11 p.m. &amp; slept like a log.  During my stay in Swansea a Miss G. Gregory of 39 Henrietta St. Swansea volunteered to show me the town &amp; places of interest tomorrow. The town impressed me as being exceptionally busy &amp; the innumerable chimneys &amp; coal mines as well as the black haze called to mind our Newcastle.  The mountains of coal were quite unique.  The countryside abounded with ruins of Castles &amp; Abbeys which are quite historic. Slept excellently. 
 Saturday 9th Up at 7.  Breakfast and travelled by 9.55 to Neath again.
