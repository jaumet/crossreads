 aerodrom , and flew so as to just pass over the top of the Cine : the effect was extrem impress . I went up in Capt Smith 's Bristol Fighter ( a 190 HP machin ) - and do over 90 mile per hour we rapid come up with the format . We went down near to Beersheba , our machin circl round the flat whilst I took cinema at 7,000 feet we look down onto the bank of cumulus and through the fleet open down . onto the old Turkish trench . Capt . Addison did a seri of manoeuvr , Loop , dive and roll etc , which show the admir control of the Pilot with modern machin . At 4.30 a spiral nose dive drop us from 5,000 to 2,500 feet in a few second . We return to the aerodrom without mishap , after a delight run , which I can onli compar with the ride of old Elijah when he went up in his heaven chariot .
