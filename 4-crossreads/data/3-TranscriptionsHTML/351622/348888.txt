<p>11 September 1916 Mon<br/>Started work last night in the dressing station. Things are very quiet only had about 8 cases all night. Slept during the day &amp; before starting work Sid Bragg &amp; myself went down to the Belgium estaminet for an hour or so. Big caterpillar engines pass through kicking up a devil of a row. Shifting guns.</p>
<p>12 September 1916 Tues<br/>Another quiet night. Major Aidy put me on giving Anti-Tetanus injections. Turned into bed at 8.30. Before going off to sleep Dick Powter poured me out a good sleeping draught from his water bottle. I slept without waking till 4 p.m. Had tea &amp; with Tom Windrum Billy Jones &amp; Sid Bragg went down to see the village. [Belle]</p>
