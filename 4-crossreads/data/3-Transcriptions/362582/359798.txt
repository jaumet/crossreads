<p>1st A.G.H. Same Spot, 27.3.16<br/>My dear Jane, Have received two lovely mails &ndash; one on Saturday &amp; the other Sunday. Amongst them one from you Feb 14th and a jolly nice newsy one too. So pleased to hear you and Eddy are quite well again. Hope you have a good time at Sassafras and return strong &amp; fat. What a pity you could not all go away to the seaside, poor old Mother &amp; Belle will be very lonely without you three. Where is Belle going for her holiday? I suppose to Annie's? Glad to hear you had a cool summer, we are still having perfect weather. Cannot say how long we will be here, but fancy we'll move on in a very short time. No 2 A.G.H. left Alexandria the other day &ndash; for different parts &ndash; No 1. A.G.H. is embarking Wednesday for parts unknown. The place is empty, all patients gone &amp; only</p>
