 27/1/16 About the lines early. We worked the men yesterday so are giving them a half holiday today. 
 Re the death penalty being enforced for offences in the field. At least two men to my knowledge have been executed; one for sleeping on his post at the Dardanelles. The other (Sgt Robins of the Wiltshire Regt.) refused in Decr. to go out on a patrol and was shot in accordance with the death penalty on the 2nd. January. 
 Orders reached us to leave here at 0700 tomorrow morning. Trucks to be pulled by horses. Advanced Guards during morning, long strings of camels passing, their drivers mere bundles of rags. 
 After lunch being a holiday went with the C.O. to Ismailia, ferried over the canal with Indian troopers and their horses, the natives hauling the chains to the tune of a chanty. Per Gharry  along the shady avenue and round the streets of this most anglicised of the towns of Egypt. Native quarter full of stinks and dirt. All hotels closed and boarded up and most private residences deserted, local Europeans either imshied out or cleared of their own accord to avoid prospects of invasion. The streets all named after different towns Rue de Dublin, Rue de Suez, Rue de Lisbon &amp;c.  The likeness of the place to Colombo is remarkable. Very few shops, one stationer &amp;c selling at the most exorbitant prices. Camels used the same as horses here long strings of them blowing bubbles with their tongues. 
 Move in the morning arranged early meal and tent striking. Contradictory orders are the curse of this military work, messing up the men awfully but somehow we muddle through. Bitterly cold weather with sleety showers.
