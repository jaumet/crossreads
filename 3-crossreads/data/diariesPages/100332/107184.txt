I took a quiet stroll around the outskirts of the Town. I passed the Church which had been hit badly damaged. I had another look at the inside where everything is still the same as after the Bombardment, I then went down a side street were I came to the Poperinghe Cemetery as the Gates were locked the Brick Wall broken down alongside I climbed over went along the Path. I was not long walking along when I soon noticed that the Tomb Stones had also been damaged by bombs shells. All of a sudden I saw a Tomb smashed in on looking down inside what a sight there were, it was awful. I could see the Coffins all smashed in, bodies all enclosed in Zinc Casings squashed up flat, in this tomb there were 12 Coffins laid on two tiers the bottom four were under water through the rain the top 4 were all smashed about pieces of wood floating in the water. I turned away in horror to think such a cruel thing could have happened continued on came across several more Tombs knocked about the same, likewise several Head stones knocked down broken in pieces. There is no mistake this Cemetery has had a bad knocking about. I came across a large shell hole amongst a lot of Graves pieces of wood Human
