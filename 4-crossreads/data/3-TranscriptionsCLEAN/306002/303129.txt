  
 3.5.15 Mon. 3rd.  To day we rode to a clump of gum trees in Zeiteoun & tied the horses up there.  We then signalled a few messages till dinner time.  Stan went to the dentist & Smithers & I were out on our own.  After dinner we came straight home & were in camp at 3 oclock.  The Colonel gave us a lecture this morning & said there was too many applications for transfers to the Infantry, & said to use Maxwells own words that we would have a belly full of fight before the war finishes.
