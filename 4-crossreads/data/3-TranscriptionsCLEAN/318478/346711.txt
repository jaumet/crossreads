March 1st 1919
Again the rain, and therefore the account of my day is easy.  The flower piece is finished and my offsider Spruce settled down by the fire and steaming sticks for straightening.
The whiskey which has been delayed for over 4 days arrived tonight & a drop of summutt to keep out the cold is grateful & comforting, but the quality is not what it used to be and I really think that army rum is better for one's health.[Drawing]The flowers are in a biscuit tin sitting on top of of a bed for a tent pole.  It The work is up to standard.  Flowers & walking sticks!  And I should be painting against time up at the "Neck".  Still there are a few days left yet and I am still hoping.
YoursG.W.L.
