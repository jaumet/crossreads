<p>3.3.19<br/>On account of the slow method of coaling having taken in only 300 tons of coal during 3 days the Authorities decided to fill us with troops &amp; send us to Taranto.  At noon we commenced embarking troops &amp; at 5 p.m. took in 2000, including officers &amp; 38 Australian sisters who are on their way to England for 3 weeks holiday previous to going to Australia for demobilision.  6 p.m. departed from Salonika for Taranto.  At 10 p.m. wireless messages re mines floating about on our track.  All troops compelled to were lifebelts &amp; strick attention to boat drill &amp; stations.</p>
<p>4.3.19<br/>Fine weather prevailed &amp; everyone enjoying themselves immensely.  The usual remark each trip.  They all wish the Indarra was going to take them to Blighty &amp; that she is a very elaborate transport.  No doubt none to equal her in the Mediterean for passenger accomodation.  At noon steaming through the Doca Channal.  At night a concert held in which the majority of the officers &amp; sisters &amp; Tommies throughly enjoyed themselves.  We have some of the troops that got over to Baku oilfield Russia last August &amp; had to evacuate same &amp; cross the Caspian Sea.  A Colonel of the Wareakshire regiment is at my table he being one of the advance party.  We have Brig. General Sally Flood &amp; a French General on board going home.  Quite a treat to have Australian sisters on board.  Seems like being back again in Australia.</p>
