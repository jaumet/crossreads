Dear Mrs. John,
So sorry that you didn't get a letter by last mail & I can't understand it as I have written at least once a week for ages.  Any how the mails are perfectly mad.  I get letters anyhow, I got 24 (how they are mounting up, my gracious you'll be getting considered rapid, 24 letters to one man alone in six months).  Anyhow I mean to say I got No. 24 & 21 together than 23 floated along & then 22 & 25 together.  So if my comments &c. are a bit disjointed
