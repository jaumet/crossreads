 My Dear Mother 
 It is quite pos. that this may reach you first  - on t'other hand it is also quite pos. that I shall get to Sydney first myself. Boat was to have left to-morrow, but I hear it is put back again, so may have another week of waiting. This is a fair cow of a place &ndash; dull and visited by few, being about the most out-of-the-way spot in all England &amp; miles from a rly. sta. Weather biting cold now &ndash; wont the Aussi sun be welcomed! You must not get it into your head that there's anything much wrong with this child &ndash; only a bit more than seemed at first. You see it wasn't exactly a pip-squeak shell that got me &ndash; from information recd. it appears that Bochie wasted close on, or more than &pound;300 worth of H.E. - &amp; then failed to do the job! A few nerves gangled up &amp; requiring change of climate for a few months. The scratches &amp; bruises are OK now, only a couple of show where they were. Pranced outside the ward yesterday on my own for first time &amp; met the Parson's wife who gave me apples etc in canteen &amp; nearly made me relapse into a state of imbecility. 
 [Written sideways along the margin:] Sept 5. letters arrived &ndash; many thanks. When did I say your letters were dull! Wait until I get back &ndash;
