<p>out at night to do the work with as much expedition as possible.</p>
<p>If the enemy is working on his own wire you are pretty safe for</p>
<p>he won&#39;t fire much for fear of hitting his own workers, but</p>
<p>if he is taking a holiday on wire work, then look out for squalls:</p>
<p>before you know where xxx you are there will be a salvo of</p>
<p>shrapnel into you, accompanied by machine gun fire.&nbsp; Of course</p>
<p>they can&#39;t see you, but they take a chance that you are working.</p>
<p>Patrols are sent out on observation work in &quot;No Man&#39;s Land&quot; and</p>
<p>occasionally they come across enemy patrols and then bombs fly</p>
<p>around.&nbsp; In this game the object is to work in behind the</p>
<p>enemy by crawling through the long grass and thus cut him off</p>
<p>from his own trench and bag the lot of them.&nbsp; Flares are</p>
<p>constantly being thrown up from either side, and until you get</p>
<p>used to them, you feel most conspicuous - don&#39;t know how the</p>
<p>enemy could miss seeing you.&nbsp; After a while you get quite</p>
<p>used to them, knowing that if you remain perfectly still in</p>
<p>whatever attitude you may be caught, you have very little chance</p>
<p>of being seen, or at least of being recognised as a man.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>Boche is up to all sorts of tricks and one wants to keep his wits</p>
<p>about him.&nbsp; In one place he planted&nbsp; a German flag on a stick</p>
<p>out in No Man&#39;s Land.&nbsp; He reckoned rightly in thinking that</p>
<p>some Britishers would be out to capture it the following night.</p>
<p>The trouble was, as soon as they got hold of the flag a bomb</p>
<p>which was attached went off and killed a couple of men.&nbsp; When</p>
<p>the Australians came to France the Huns thought they would try</p>
<p>the same trick on them but the Australians had heard of this</p>
<p>before so they went out with a rope and lassoed that flag.</p>
<p>The bomb went off all right but they brought the flag in without</p>
