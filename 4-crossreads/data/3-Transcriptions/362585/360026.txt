<p>Dear Mrs. Ferguson,</p>
<p>The parcel arrived a few days ago in excellent condition.  Thanks very much.</p>
<p>I wonder whether you received my answer to your letter written in Dubbo.  These circuit trips seem to be rather enjoyable I should so like to try one.  Perhaps in about another 10 or 15 years I may be able to do so.</p>
<p>I am going back to France on Wednesday next after having had a very enjoyable time.  I don't know what they are going to do with me but expect to be went back to my old Battalion for a while.</p>
<p>I have had no letters from Dorothy for quite a long time now.  Will you please see that she writes to me at once.</p>
<p>Best love to everyone,<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C. R. Lucas</p>
