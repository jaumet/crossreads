There was a method however that certainly was smart in its simplicity & was the means used by which we often got two of everything for the one price. Fat & Charlie however always got tea & cake for nix by this method. In outline it consisted of waiting until a crowd had gathered around the counter & then in an indignant tone demanding your tea or coffee as the case maybe & was usually followed by yes sir! Sorry & so on! & out came the food for nix.
The plates, knives & other utensils however were absolutely caked with last meal's food but that does not worry after one week in camp. Our regular rations were eaten out in the open & usually got covered with grass & dirt but the food was good & on Sundays we could get chipped spuds etc .Occasionally we could come the double on the tins of jam & so on until we became thorough rogues but one is placed in such a position that one must do these things to make life happy & bearable. Otherwise camp life is "Up to putty."
