 3.7.15 Sat. 3rd.  Geo. Edwards went to Lemnos this morning to buy stores for C Sqd.  I gave him 7/- to buy rice, oatmeal, milk &amp; sugar.  Cameron was sent away sick this morning, nearly all of us have had a touch of dysentery, but yesterday &amp; to-day I have felt as well as ever I did.  I gave Cameron 1/- (my last) to buy paper &amp; envelopes when he is coming back.  Stan has not been feeling too well lately &amp; is still crook on it.  Rained a little last night &amp; this morning but we managed to keep dry by spreading a couple of blankets over our dug-out.  We have been talking a good deal about having some signalling practise but have not raised the necessary energy so far.  We went for a swim again tonight &amp; it was glorious.  Our Howitzers have been doing a good deal of firing to-day otherwise everything rather quiet here.
