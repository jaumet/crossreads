<p>The Drs put us through the same rigmarole this afternoon but its only a farce for they know very well that there is nothing the matter with the men, our protest was printed in the papers today</p>
<p>Had a sharp reminder that we are back once more among flies at tea this evening for I found maggots crawling in my meat the first I have seen for 4 years.</p>
<p>Brotchie a Sgt at our table is a long way overdrawn through the Authorities fault, &amp; because of this they would not pay him any money</p>
<p>We did not like to see him go ashore penniless so our table threw in 5/- each &amp; made him up a &pound; 1 or two</p>
<p>Have had the Victorians biting like one thing this evening over their papers, quarantine, rivers &amp; etc</p>
