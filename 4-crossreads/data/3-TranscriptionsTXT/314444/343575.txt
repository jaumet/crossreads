 France, June 28th 1917. 
 My Dear Mrs. Fletcher, 
 It is with feelings of very deep regret that I write to you of the death of your gallant son No. 413 Pte. T. J. Fletcher. He was killed in the battle of Messines on June 8th. 
 I deeply deplore the death of so excellent a soldier. During the battle he distinguished himself by his courage, coolness &amp; determination. At all times he was reliable and hardworking, &amp; he was always cheerful and ready in the performance of every duty. He won the affection and esteem of his officers &amp; comrades: we all mourn the loss of such a splendid man. 
 Officers, non-commissioned-officers &amp; men all join me in offering you and your family most heartfelt sympathy in this your great bereavement. 
 Yours very sincerely, Leslie J. Morshead. Lieut.-Colonel.
