after being abused like that & everyone in the car hostile to him, women & all threw angry & disdainful glances at him & passed sarcastic remarks but he must have had a hide like a rhineosceros for he took little notice.We were all paid again yesterday for the last time they said previous to going aboard ship.Was inoculated the second time.  I thought it just as well to get done in case a chap got turned back before going on the boat for they are very particular over it & are entering the date & etc. in your pay book.  I don't think its very important for the scare seems to have died down.
17th.  Ethel & I went out to Yelverton again yesterday afternoon & went for a stroll down to some pretty little old fashioned villages nestling in the little gullies, by the way the population turned out all curious they have not seen too many Australians
