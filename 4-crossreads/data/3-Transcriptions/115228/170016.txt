<p>any goods. Raining today.</p>
<p><u>Dec7th</u>:- Moved back again in the early hours of the night to our old camp at Rechon-le-Zian. Our duty at Jaffa was merely to protect some battries of guns until Infantry arrived and relieved us. Been raining off and on for two days &amp; nights &amp; still unsettled.</p>
<p><u>Dec 8th</u>:- News was received today that Jerusalem fell early this morning to our Infantry, we have thus now occupied practically the whole of Palestine, after a most successful campaign.</p>
