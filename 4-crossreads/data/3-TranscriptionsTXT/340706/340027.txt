I find myself in company with a Scotch machine gunner named Johnston. He is not anxious to pay for room & we look for hostel. In search I find a large house well lit up & door open I go in but can find no one In one room I find the unfinished meal of some people & sit down & have a meal on what is left Scoty is afraid to enter & I bring him out some bread & cheese.
