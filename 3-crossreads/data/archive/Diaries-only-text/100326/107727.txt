Arrived Alexandria at 1.15 am and disentraining on to the quay just alongside HMT Scotian and embarked. The disentraining disembarkation a credit for silence rapidity.

Allotted cabin with Capt Curnow very comfortable. Supervised embarkation until 4pm then had some tea, shaved bathed. When reveille
