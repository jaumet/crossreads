XIIIwhat you will be putting in the Bank for me so I can keep a tally of my "financial position" - Don't stint yourselves over this money Father - and I hope with what Pat can spare you will be able to some little comfort, such as a trip occasionally or something of the sort.  I am drawing 35/- a day now 5/- of which is deferred and with my allotment of 1 I will have ample for my needs.
