<p>Saturday 16 August 1919<br/>Cold &amp; windy today. The boat is rolling a bit. Had a meeting of officers about the thieving this morning. Going to have a Kit inspection. just before lunch the Kit inspection was cancelled. Judged three fights today &amp; the fighting was very good indeed. The officers team pulled F Coy diggers team in tug of war &amp; won 2 out of 3. The end of the boat won each time. Some 40 odd diggers had a bolshivick meeting &amp; demanded more deck space. Silly old colonel gave it to them too. Think he's frightened of them. Gee its icy cold tonight. The boat is rolling &amp; pitching to some order too.</p>
<p>Sunday 17 August 1919<br/>Very cold again today. Still a big sea. Quite a lot of the diggers are down with sea sickness. Did absolutely nothing all day. Saw another whale. Came third in the big sweep &amp; got 10/-  but was halves with another officer. Still 5/- is handy any old time. The C. O. received a petition today from 240 diggers asking for the release of the prisoners. It was refused.</p>
