<p>shelling to-day.</p>
<p>Saturday 11th Sept<br/>Very keen &amp; cool &ndash; windy. A number of our men due to go away for a spell for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Sunday 12th Sept<br/>Very like rain. Men to leave late to night. Mouse bit finger while laying half dozing. They run in &amp; out of bags of which my store wall is built etc.</p>
<p>Fixed up a stretcher in store to make myself a little more comfortable. It was fine &ndash; you can bet I slept finely this evening.</p>
<p>Monday 13th<br/>Our men did not leave as anticipated but came back early in the evening very disappointed. I had a lot of trouble to fix up extra</p>
