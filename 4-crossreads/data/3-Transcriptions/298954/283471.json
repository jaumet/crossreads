<p>1917<br/>2nd June.<br/>In one corner a group of niggers were squatting on their haunches and chattering &ndash; in another an Irish-Liverpool fireman was torturing a waltz out of a concertina to a rapt group of assorted cockneys, &amp; other former occupants of the foc'sl.  A small corner was partitioned off for officers &ndash; prominent playing bridge being the venerable looking Captain of the barque "Dee" &ndash; a pious white-bearded old fraud who bore the classic sobriquet of "Mudguts".</p>
<p>An armed sentry marches to and fro among the prisoners night &amp; day.  Finally, we were each given a hammock of brown canvas &amp; a blanket; slung same in a corner of the bulkhead up against the mine-chamber and tried to sleep.</p>
