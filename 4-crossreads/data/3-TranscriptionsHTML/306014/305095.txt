<p>detention room &amp; my duty to keep an eye on the prisoners, of whom there were 11 when I went on duty &amp; 19 when I came off. The job was not too congenial but we have to take the good with the bad. The prisoners gave me no trouble; perhaps because I was armed with a naked bayonet! but the guard room itself was so small &amp; inconvenient that I had not a wink of sleep for the 24 hours. Part of the time was spent in washing &amp; writing, part in dreaming etc.</p>
