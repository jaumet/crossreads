 SATURDAY, APRIL 19, 1919. 
 Fine & hot. Went over to see 
 Mum & Dad in the morning. 
 Saw Sisters Lynam & Fraser on 
 the way & they gave me a lift 
 to Carnarvon. Mum & I went 
 down & saw Aunt Janie before 
 lunch. Aunt Millie & [M r  Sauter?] 
 came to Carnarvon for afternoon 
 tea. I came back here for dinner. 
 Linda & I went down to the 
 look out after.
