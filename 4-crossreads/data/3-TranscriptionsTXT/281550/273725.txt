  December  
 The german who wrote these notices no doubt thought that he was fairly well up in the knowledge of the English Language. 
 On about the 18th a Frenchman was shot dead by a German sentry just outside my hut. The bullet entered his stomach and passed out halfway down his thigh. 
 The men who saw him shot said that the German deliberately shot him for nothing at all. 
 They said that he was just walking along whistling to himself. 
 He was buried on the 20th. The Germans gave him a decent burial, They had the Band and firing party and buried him with full military honours in the cemetery adjoining the Camp. 
 On the night of December the 21st we weer officially ordered to get ready to leave Soltau to-morrow the 22nd
