<p>25-1-17<br/>Thurs 25th<br/>The two English Officers who were out yesterday were on leave. We came to the conclusion that they were either broke or "dotty" to put in leave out there; We had a couple of English Tank Officers out today to see how the country is for them they say the tanks could have taken Rafa in half an hour needless to say we are anxious to see them in action; I put today in between the blankets &amp; am feeling a good deal better tonight than I was yesterday. Capt Weir has been posted to B.Sqdn &amp; Higginson sent to details . Kater is coming from B.H.Q. as Adjutant.</p>
