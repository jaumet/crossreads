  
 December 1916 a considerable number of casualties. 18th   I have been on the same work in Needle trench since the 13th & have also built a machine-gun position for purpose of defence against aeroplanes which are numerous & at times fly very low.  We have been shelled heavily most of the time & have had a fair casualty list. (Fritz shelling seems to be concentrated on the "solitary tree" about a hundred yds in rear of us for the past 4 or 5 days.  The duckwalk track which leads past it has suffered a few direct hits.
