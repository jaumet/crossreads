 Our horses are in good nick &amp; get well looked after. The desert sun is very hot but we have managed to get a little shelter rigged here &amp; there, which proves a great boon. Rations are good as can be &amp; we are having a real good turn. Of course we've earned it. 
 I've got three splendid nags &amp; you can bet we're good pals. I've picked up a good knowledge of horses here &amp; do some enjoyable rides. We are too far from the canal for swimming but will get a turn there bye &amp; bye. 
 There have been one or two stunts of which the papers will have published in detail ere this. A week or so ago an aeroplane flew over one of the L.H. camps &amp; dropped fifteen bombs accounting for 9 men &amp; 14 horses killed. It was "No man standing" for a few jiffs. Of course he caught them at stables so was able to do a double shift &amp; get away. 
 The desert is not very interesting from a physical aspect, but it is marvellous to see the wonderful hiding places to be found everywhere in it. Everything is sand &amp; the wind makes some tremendous mounds &amp; some equally tremendous hollows. I have seen hollows quite two hundred feet deep.
