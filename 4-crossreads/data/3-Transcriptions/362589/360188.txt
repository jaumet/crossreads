<p>My dear Ferguson<br/>Your letter came 3 days ago &ndash; and I thank you for it. What could you say? What can I reply? &ndash; Archies death is disaster to us for which there is no remedy. The world will never be the same again &ndash; and if I have the misery to grow really old I shall go sadly to the end. I hope that length of days be left out to me. I have had sufficient &ndash; I heard Archie was wounded at Colombo &ndash; I never doubted but that he was dead &ndash; and I heard it was so at Suez &ndash; It was a horrid voyage &ndash; but there were v kind folk on board. I of course hurried on to England so I had no chance to look for yr boy &ndash; I pray all will go well with your brave children &ndash; and that the sorrow of "looking on ones children in the light of ancestors", Bruce E Burkes expression when his only son died, may not fall heavier upon you. I let my feelings go to you dear man for I am not unmindful of that tragic night in the Blue Mountains &ndash; It is etched in my mind now &ndash; and so you know all about my present blackness of despair &ndash; I got home and found May a wreck &ndash; her support being Stephanie Barton, who was with her when the news came, guite casually too, in an advising letter to Stephanie, not from official sources. Stephanie has turned out a very rock of defence in these distressful days &ndash;</p>
