23rd October 1916
Early morning stables. Signalling part of the day. Capt. Campbell injured today by horse. Went over to 8th Brigade tonight for horses for tomorrow's stunt. In harness room up till 10 cleaning up gear for inspection by General Brunker tomorrow.
24th October 1916
Reveille 4.30. Early morning stables. Left with H.Qrs. Battery full marching order for inspection by General Brunker at 8.45. Weather inclined to be rainy. Our Battery inspected in line by General which passed off alright. But the manoeuvres c. were utterly spoilt by incompetent officers. I only wish Capt. Campbell had been able to come. A crying shame for all the boys did their best. Anyhow the General fairly roared out his wrath on the Battery which dashed our hopes for a good turnout. Returned at 1.30 very downhearted. In stable all afternoon and also the harness room. Received letters from Commonwealth Bank re cabled money, also letter from father Nance. Did not go out.
