<p>Friday August 3, 1917. (1096.).<br/>The war has been raging exactly 3 years today. Those three years have been a terrible time for all the countries concerned and in a lesser degree to neutrals, for there is no nation that has not suffered more or less by the Great War. But the signs of the times points to its early termination. Some of the British artillery point to a Biblical phrophecy that it will end when it has run 42 lunar months. That would be 3 years &amp; about 2 months and 3 weeks, or about 22 of October.<br/>The weather shows an improvement today. But it is yet very muddy, and the sky is cloudy.<br/>There was some intennce artillery activity N. of Messines. By the way the ruins of Messines is only about half a mile E. of here. This afternoon is very wet &amp; sloppy &amp; miserable.<br/>We have been expecting to leave here this past few days, &amp; at last we are to leave to morrow. I had another interview with Mr. Murrey the Brigade boomer re my attachment to the Mills Grenade.<br/>Since I came here I have had my P.H. Helmet &amp; bayonet stolen. But I got another bayonet this afternoon.</p>
<p>Saturday August 4, 1917. (1097).<br/>The weather took up a bit this morning, but in the afternoon it was as bad as ever, and the roads are a quagmire.<br/>We expected to go today. I packed up and rolled my blankets this morning in readiness, and later we got word that we are not to go until to morrow. The sky being so cloudy, there have been very few aeroplanes about during the past few days. Our artillery in this sector has been fully active this evening, but the enemy is doing little. He killed a number of men on the road.</p>
