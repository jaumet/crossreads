<p>Tuesday, 1 June,1915<br/>We left the Galeka after dinner and transferred to the Itonius which is going back to Lemnos and the Dardanelles with a load of convalescents British, Aust, NZ French Zouaves Indians Senegalese, there will be a big cargo on board as there is a load of rails on apparently they are going to put a railway line down somewhere.  The load is a large one of the B. India Line with a Lascar crew.  We will be a mixed lot There has been a further advance by the Allies at Gaba Tepe and Ache Baba.  Went ashore for a walk and a feed as we will soon be back to the iron rations.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 2 June.<br/>Fatigues all the morning, unloading, went on board the lighter after dinner and were sorry to leave the Galeka, she is a very decent boat.  Arrived at the Itonius, found her to be a big boat but dirty.  There is a heavy cargo on board rails etc. There are 1,500 on board and only accommodation for 900 so we are pretty crowded.  They were just lying on the deck anywhere  we have the most mixed lot imaginable every regiment that one can think of to cap all about five am a train load of Egyptian engineers arrived under an armed guard as the last lot they tried to ship bolted as soon as they saw the wounded they are a cowardly lot.  Just as we were about to sail an order came that A section had to go on another boat, we were all disgusted for one thing it was it was another split and moreover they took the Major with them and he will fight to get them again into the firing line but we with the Colonel suffering from cold feet have only a poor chance. There are only about ten of the original that enlisted at B. Meadows in B. Sect. now all the others are reinforcements.</p>
