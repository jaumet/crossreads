I find it very hard sewing it by hand because it is of holland, specially as I have made extra work to it by putting flaps to cover each pocket to keep the sand out, but it is not too hard to do.  I feel most grateful to Evelyn for the idea of the thing for it is very useful indeed.Well my darling People I must close this.  I sometimes get a little bit lonely away from you all, but I am quite comfortable and content because it seems that this [is] my right place just at present.     This Pension is quite nice, though certainly the French cooking sometimes gets on my nerves, I don't like it a scrap, but anyhow it is much the best Pension in the town as far as position & handiness to everything are concerned.  By the way the Methodist Church is just opposite on one corner did I tell you?  I have two pairs of French windows and quite a fine outlook from the little balcony belonging to each.  They make the balconies here very tiny, not long enough to walk up & down & so very narrow, only just wide enough for a chair to squeeze on.Oh I must tell you that while Rid & I were out yesterday flying round on his business we came across five Newcastle soldier boys that we knew very well, all in different parts of the town.  That is more than we have met in any one day before though I suppose it will seem to you that we ought to have met lots every day.So very much love to you dear Home Folks, I do hope you are managing to keep from worrying too much & from being too lonely.          Your very loving daughterOlive
