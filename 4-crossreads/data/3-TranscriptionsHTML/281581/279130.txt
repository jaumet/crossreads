<p>23rd July 18</p>

<p>24th July 18.</p>
<p>All day with Ponting on his lecture. Ponting is quite a charming character, honorable and a man to be relied upon. I like him immensely. He is however, frightfully finnicky, with too much regard for trifles, which he is prone to magnify to the extent of worrying himself. His work I cannot speak too highly in praise of and I set him up as an ideal.  <br/>Evening withMartin discussing</p>
