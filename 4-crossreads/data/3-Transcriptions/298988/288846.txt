<p>I got a most pleasant surprise this a.m. at breakfast.  The Captain handed me a letter from home &amp; it is the first I have received since leaving Australia.  As we have just got instructions to depart for the Dardanelles in 3 hours time, I am very pleased, especially as it contains good advice.  Had a few Australian Soldiers aboard last night &amp; we gave them a real good time.<br/>11.40 a.m.  Left Anchorage in the Bay &amp; are now bound to the North West corner of Lemnos Island, where we will arrive at 4 p.m. &amp; anchor till 11 p.m. when we proceed to the Dardanelles arriving at daylight &amp; we then start the business of getting our Troops, Horses &amp; Guns etc ashore on the open beach of the Gallipoli Peninsula, by means of Lighters barges etc.</p>
