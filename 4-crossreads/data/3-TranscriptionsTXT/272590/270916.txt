La Madelon (A Yankee translation)Below the camp where many soldiers muster,There is an inn that they call the "porlus" [?] rest,A modest house, whose walls with ivy clusterHard by the sheltering woods, a cosy nest,The girl who waits on us is pleasingLike sparkling wine her eyes in funShe hardly halts to hear our teasingShe's only known as Madelon.All through our dreams at night all through our day's dull chanceShe's only Madelon perhaps, but she's Romance.
ChorusWhen Madelon comes tripping to our tableWe boldly pluck her skirt as she goes byAnd each one whispers low his pretty fableMade up to win her, on the sly.Our Madelon is not a surly beauty.So when we chuck her chin to lead her onShe laughs - that's all - and feels she's done her duty.Madelon, Madelon, Madelon.
