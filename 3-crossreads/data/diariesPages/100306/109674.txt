Ribemont 
26/1/17 The coldest morning yet although sunny. The nip of the air penetrated wraps and made ears feel as if falling off. Breath froze in moustache. Formed mass on the ground well out of the village and shook out into waves. Carried out an attack on two lines of trenches working under an imaginary barrage which lifted twice. It was cold for the men owing to so much standing about. In the afternoon turned them out again and it only took a quarter of an hour to shake the scheme out and we rapidly ran it through formed up and were back home before 3.30 pm. The bombers were wearing their protective apparatus of chain visor viels, armoured jackets and thick padded shoulder protectors. In the evening Bunning Alderson reported back and joined us in the Mess. Both keen and glad to be back and full of disregard at the coldfooters there. Our padre's fame has spread there. We miss his presence here as a refining influence on table talk. Speech becomes at times very coarse
