safely through. after him came various victims, some of the boys grew tired of waiting and scrambled through the fence, and went back to the tents others took the road that led to town and went in on their own. then an officer appeared, called to the men to form up in fours. but he might as well have asked a mob of Gulf country cattle to form fours. we marched to town, and through the town spread from one side of the street to tother, onto the Rly Stn. and straight into the trucks that were waiting, we had just settled down when along came the officer a nice enough chap and asked the men to get out of the trucks and form up in fours on the Platform, they got out but the fours business, was finished so far as they were concerned. and after awhile the officers gave up and told them to get back into the train, they got back in about two seconds and settled down again. all the trouble could easily have been avoided had things been worked with just a little system .. but in No. 5 the first thing that one notices, is the absolute lack of system of any sort.
