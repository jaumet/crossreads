Walking through the slum parts on the extremity of the town we passed along some very pretty country lanes on roads, bordered on each side by farms.  The village at the base of the hills is 4&#189; miles from the town, & we covered the distance in a little over an hour.  The climb up the hill which must be at least 600ft high, was a stiff one and we arrived at the top feeling very stiff, but the sight that met our eyes well repaid us for the trouble.
