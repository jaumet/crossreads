  
 Saturday 23 March 1918 Oliver Lee still missing.  Fear that he is a prisoner so hope that he has come to no worse harm.  No news at all about them. Miss Oliver very much as we were great pals and shared a tent for 6 months. 
 Sunday 24 March 1918 Recco at 6 a.m.  Pilot Capt. Addison.  In air 3 h. 20 m., Nablus, Damie, Es Salt, Amman. A most trying trip through thick clouds.  A very difficult time in clouds and big bumps.  The worst trip I have had so far.  Addie flew well.
