 15th Brigade did not even reach the first Hun trench. They had 400 yards to charge &amp; did not get up, the 14th had 350, &amp; the 8th, 300 yards. 
 In consequence of this the 14th Brigade suffered terribly being subjected to frontal attack as well as being enfiladed on both right &amp; left and for a while suffered from the rear, as well, from their own artillery. 
 To those on watch in the firing line while the battle was raging, one of two things should have been done. As soon as the men reached the third trench the whole of the men should have been withdrawn back to the Huns first trench or the Battalions in the firing line should have been ordered to their support to beat back the Huns advance. Why the men out in front were kept there so long without support in men &amp; munitions, was beyond the "ken" of the privates watching &amp; could it be wondered that they kept on growling! What the hell are the Commanders doing? Can they not see things as clear as the men on the firestep? Surely they were watching too &amp; if so they surely could see what was so apparent to privates!
