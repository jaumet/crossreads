<p>1-12-16<br/>Fri 1st<br/>This morning Edwards &amp; I went out to Gererat with a troop of A Sqdn as body guard to Gen. Cox &amp; 4 staff Officers belonging to a Welch Division now marching from Kantara to Mazar, we found Gererat a depression in the ground with no sign of palms &amp; a party of Australian Engineers trying to get a good water supply. The Welch Officers rode camels out, we arrived back in camp at 1 PM, had Bains from D.A.D.O.S. here for dinner. The Adj (Gerbill) told me this afternoon that we would have to find the observation posts tomorrow &amp; after 8 oclock tonight he discovered that we would not have to find it. that is the second time he has discovered a mistake, which puts me to a good deal of unnecessary work warning men.</p>
