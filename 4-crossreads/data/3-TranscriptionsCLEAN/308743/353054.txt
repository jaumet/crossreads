 31 October 1914 Saturday 
 Reveille at 6. Drew feed for No 5 Hold & then had breakfast after which practical semaphore & morse for the benefit of Toby was indulged in.  then we entered No 2 Hold to see after bikes then looked for jam - found other stores also raisins then had a washing parade, but water very scarce as only one gallon allowed per man.  No mail today, & we are off tomorrow morning thank goodness.  Steamers ordered at 2 PM today & we move out at 6 in the morning heard also the America has declared war on Japan but find out later that it is unfounded.  We saw a beaut concert & it was surprising what talent there is on board from the Captain downwards during the performance a fire broke out but was instantly suppressed.  Tim Elder paid us a visit during concert.  SS Sydney came in during night & has joined the Imperial fleet more chess then went to bed, looking forward to the roll of the ocean again.
