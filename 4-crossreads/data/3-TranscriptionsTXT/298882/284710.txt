The long tramp out through mud and slush with High Explosive shells dogging us was enough to turn the darkest and stoutest hair grey in one act.  We reached Zonnebeke camp had a feed and went to sleep.  We came on here to Dickebusch Camp today and had a good clean up.  Nearly every body suffering from husky throat or cough due to a combined action of gas and cold.
