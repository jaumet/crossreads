13 September 1918 Friday (X to X crossed out)Jordan Valley    Returned to the exclusive area- X In evidence I found Desert Corps men alone spend between 20 000 & 30 000 a month at AIF Canteens- mostly Tucker- XDuring my absence the underlings of our Staff have exercised their ingenuity by making us build dummy horses out of Bamboos & Hessian to deceive  enemy aircraft!!!  On the road I passed many of Egyptian Labor Corps mending roads & all singing their native love song Cum-Leyla Cum-Low, or something like it meaning How many days & how many nights before I see my beloved again-
