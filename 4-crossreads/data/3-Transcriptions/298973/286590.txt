<p>You will be surprised that most of the boys voted NO to the conscription question. Some do not thoroughly understand the copious exemptions, and as they leave brothers to support their families they don't feel inclined to have them sent over. Others say they will not fight beside conscripts. Some again say they don't see why others should have to go through the hell they have gone through in France. So I think it remains for the women's vote in Australia to carry it. I won't discuss it here, I'm pretty sore on the question at present.</p>
