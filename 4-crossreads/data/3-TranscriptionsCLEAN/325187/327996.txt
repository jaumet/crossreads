(Gum Ck) !!!  Went to Ealing & saw Cotton family had Tea & got back by 5 all were well & old Coles full of Munitions work.No sun today.  Mrs L. showed me your last letter dear little Mother I never "commanded 2 Brigades" this would be an Army Cols or General's command.I was Camp Commandant at SOHAG, but that is different altogether, only discipline Sanitation & Licenses etc etc.
