My dear JudgeI am still fit. Am quartered in a very nice Belgian Billet very comfortable and owned by a very nice old Belgian "Madame"  The country is very pretty and very green but awfully wet and boggy. The C.O. went on leave last night I am temporarily commanding the show. The Bn is spread all over the country side and some of the officers are about 2 miles away from their men.
Had a dreadful row over some courts martial the other day. I am not quite sure whether I won or not. I don't think I shall be put on any more courts for a while anyway.
Everyone is talking at once and I find it difficult to write letters. Abroz is the worst offender. He sends his kindest regards to you. He also says that he intends to write to you soonBest LoveYours affectionately
CR Lucas.
