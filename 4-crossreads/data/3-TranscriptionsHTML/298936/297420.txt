<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Tuesday 21</p>
<p>Spent the morning in fiddling  about which means doing nothing.  Apparently the authorities are going to depart their usual custom &amp; get us off as arranged.</p>
<p>Oh dear no. No such thing. "A.M.C. go to Anzac <u>eventually"</u> tomorrow possibly but no earlier. Did my washing tonight after putting it off &amp; off.</p>
<p>Had some fun with the boys in the afternoon [indecipherable] the present moment my Birkenhead friend is waiting for a yarn.</p>
