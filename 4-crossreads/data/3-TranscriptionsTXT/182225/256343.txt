 AUGUST &nbsp; SATURDAY 12 &nbsp; 1916 
 Warm &amp; close. It came&nbsp;on to sprinkle in the morning the first rain since we landed in England 34 days ago. Out signallling all the morning &amp; had a good old sleep in the afternoon. Wrote some letters in evening. Some of our fellows got London leave &amp; went up in the morning. Warren came down in evening and he &amp; Self, two Hunters and Harry M c Innis went to a variety show at Larkhill. It was a rotten show, but one girl there was weird the contortions she made of herself.
