  
 Tuesday 22 January Weather wet though warm.  Day still spent in fatigue reading & playing cards & occasionally going to the pictures or a concert. 
 Wednesday 23 January Weather still dull but warm.  Ordinary routine of camp life.  A lecture on Armegeddon developed into a very dry sermon & bored me to death.
