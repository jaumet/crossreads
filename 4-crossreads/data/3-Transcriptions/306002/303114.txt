<p>19.4.15<br/>Mon. 19th.  Regimental drill all day &amp; had a fairly rough time of it.  Idleboy has been lame since Friday, &amp; I rode Nelsons mare to-day &amp; found her to be as rough as it is possible to get them.  We were drilling on the desert;  arrived back in Camp before 3 oclock.  After tea Pitt &amp; I had a game of billiards &amp; then put in half an hour at a concert that was given as a send off to Mr. Bell who is connected with the Y.M.C.A. here.</p>
