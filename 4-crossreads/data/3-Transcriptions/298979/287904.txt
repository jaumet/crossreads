<p>move one Coy (B) to the support line &amp; they could not think of letting the other Coys take over the front line till they were rested properly.</p>
<p>Those waiting to be relieved cursed their "stiff" luck but now knowing they had to "stick it" for another 24 hours they became resigned</p>
<p>The incident of bringing in, &amp; enjoying the "tucker" brightened up the drooping spirits of the men &amp; by the time the meal was over they were quite cheerful &amp; "chirpy".</p>
<p>About one oclock in the afternoon the Sergt called for a man to relieve the Sentry on duty, to enable the latter to have his meal of bread &amp; jam &amp; nip of Rum. &amp; the nearest one G[dash] took the post at the end of the trench</p>
<p>Knowing the position was in view of the Huns on the ridge in front, care had to be taken not to expose the head or any part of the body which would have made a good target for the enemy gunners.</p>
<p>At this period the Huns working on the ridge evidently realising that our men would not fire became so very confident that one openly jumped up on to the parapet of the trench they were digging &amp; began to arrange the mud forming the parapet.</p>
<p>One of the men who had been keenly watching his movements stated "The temptation is too great, I must have a shot at that man!</p>
<p>Although he was requested not to do so as the Hun Machine gunners on the right would probably start enfilading he said, Oh! I must really stop that Hun working so openly!, &amp; with that he trained his rifle on the "target" &amp; fired. The Hun dropped at once but struggled to his feet when it was seen that he had evidently been badly hit in the leg for he appeared to drag it till he reached the edge of the trench when the other Huns assisted him into the trench.</p>
<p>Nothing of any consequence happened</p>
