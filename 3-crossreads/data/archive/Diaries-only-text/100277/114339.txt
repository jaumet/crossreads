all lined up along the road, there must have been hundreds they were all French there were a lot of colored troops with them, one for each bus to help the driver they come from Madagascar were not at all bad looking, they all had bonzer warm fur coats on made from goat skins I think, they looked very comical but I'll bet they were warm for they reached nearly to their shins.
After a bit of manouvering 30 odd men were told off for each one of these blacks led each party to the motor, they seemed very pleased as they led the boys down, it seems to be a regular thing with the French to run their troops to the firing line for these buses were fitted up for the purpose seats, rifle racks all, they shifted the whole Brigade at one stroke in this fashion something like 4 or 5000 men
