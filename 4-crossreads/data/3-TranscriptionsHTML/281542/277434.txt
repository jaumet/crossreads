It is said in regard to Countess Lisandra's (of the Kursaal) performance that the Bishop of Jerusalem has written that he took umbrage at "the nude lady", whereas Col. Anderson, QMG, replied:  "My dear Lord Bishop if you spent a few years in Australia, it would not only lessen the size of your hat but increase the capacity of your soul".  Whereupon I suppose the Bishop went mad.</p>
