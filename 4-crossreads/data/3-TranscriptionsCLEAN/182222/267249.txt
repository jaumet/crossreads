 Caught the Tosara in No 3 Store. Bust into a stack of cases, broached some, drank some, carried away the rest. All intended for naval officers. To Transport Ulysses. Shewn our new quarters "Hell on Sea" Indicator says L Deck messing 236 sleeping 233  over 340 of us have to get into this space & there's no ventilation of any sort, not even a wind shute & the hatch is covered with a stack of timber. L Deck is right if somewhat far fetched for a pun.                                                                     Enough regulations on this boat to make criminals of the heavenly choir.                P. L. has been got off & taken to Gib to repair. A lucky ship. Had she not broken down the M. would have got her one hour later.                                                       On this tub we're told we must drill & look less like a lot of pirates.
