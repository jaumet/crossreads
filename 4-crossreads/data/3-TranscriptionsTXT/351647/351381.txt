most thankful, our fellows have had a long trying spell & needed a rest.  They are not getting that altogether but it is a change anyhow & away from the guns & they get a decent night's rest.  It isn't a bad spot, [indecipherable] comfortable huts, plenty of space, grassy paddocks & lots of trees.  Also two or three bonzer swimming pools which of course are very largely used.  I go in quite lots.  I was most busy for a few days after our arrival here but things have calmed down a lot & I am able to take life quietly.
Had a great tour round the country on Tuesday, started at 5 a.m. (really 4) & it was delicious.  Went on my own & chose my own way route & halts &c.  The country is simply glorious these days.  I don't know how long we will be out but I suppose we'll be going back to business again soon.  We are all fairly fed up but they keep very cheerful.
I have been wondering how you are & what you are doing, haven't had a letter for quite ages.  I'm not rousing on you now, I know you write every week, you brick of a woman & a friend.  But aren't the mails simply
