I am also posting one each to Aunt Katie and Mardie. In a letter to Father a week or so ago I mentioned posting him a Kai Ora Coo-ee news which gives us the war news - very warm here now. Unfortunately the copy I had was pinched, but there was not much in it that you would not see at home. I'll try and post another one along later. There was an article on the Dust of Jericho in the first issue I was sending you which was very good - but you may have seen it as I think it was published also in the Sydney papers. Best love Mother dear 
 Your loving son

 P.S. Has not the lion in the mosaic got a benevolent smile. He must have just eaten about ten infidels I'm sure!
