At 7pm the Cape Hellis division of the fleet, commenced a very heavy bombardment against Achi Baba; they shelled the hills mercilessly for hours, the bursting shells lighting up the great impediment to the English army's advance, and presenting a magnificent spectacle.<br/><u>Thursday 13th May.</u>  As we had taken all the water we required from the tank we shifted back to our old anchorage near the "Queen" at 6.30am.</p>
