Dear girl
It's Monday morning - 9  - 30 am   -  & we'v heard the big guns firing 'down the bay'  -  The Melbourne went out yesterday & we heard there was likely to be a scrap outside  -  Firing went on at intervals for 3/4 of an hour & then ceased  -  Well - I shall tell later about this  -  What I'm after now is to tell you of our star turn yesterday - two of us at any rate up & down & one of the 2 was me  -  Our first time on the beach  - About noon a general order or notice came out - Flag ship of course  -  It was to the effect that the British flag would be hoisted & saluted at 3 pm over the island of New Britain  -  A declaration of annexation read  -  A parade wd be held at 2. 50 pm & then came details of dress  -  Swords to be worn  -  Service helmets & the usual white rig out  -  The Submarine chaps & our officers had no rig out & so couldn't comply  -  No more could I but I meant to be there somehow  -  After lunch I found out that our Captain had borrowed a helmet & a bally sword & meant to turn up so I went & spoke [indecipherable]  -  He referred me to Besant & I promptly went & asked got leave to go  -  Got it all right & then rigged myself up in my new serge suit
