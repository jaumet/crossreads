 Thursday 6 December 1917. 
 Bivouaced at 12.45 am. No stand to. In bivouac 1 mile from village of Tebna. Cold &amp; bleak day. My camel&#39;s back crook after last nights movements. 
 Bgde got lost last&nbsp;night and only travelled 8 miles direct although the track they took was about 15 miles. Stayed here  most of  the day &amp; tried to move out at night but rain made country impassable. 
 Ration convoy was lost &amp; rain came on again so Bgde could not move.
