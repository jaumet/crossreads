<p>1917 October</p>
<p>21 Sunday</p>
<p>Day of mist like Scotland.  Feeling sick.  Think I had too much heavy food sans exercise, so dragged my lame leg over the hill for exercise.  Came on to rain <strike> all</strike> &amp; poured unceasingly all night.  Moir &amp; Pope left for Salonique in morning.</p>
