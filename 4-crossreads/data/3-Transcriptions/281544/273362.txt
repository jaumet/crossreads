<p>Monday 12th<br/>was very low as it was very foggy, &amp; it was hard to see them, when I got line clear I came away to Reigersberg Nth &amp; put my two trucks into a Siding &amp; picked up my Troop Train &amp; when it was loaded away I went at 7.15am up to St Jean &amp; put some Men out &amp; further along I went &amp; put out some more, when the alarm again was sounded &amp; up in the Air I could see 5 Taubes hovering about. I did not move my train as it is harder to hit a Standing Train, Men were running for shelter &amp; along the main Road a number of Motor Transports halted, I could hear Bombs exploding away in the Fog. The Taubes soon were hunted away by our Machines &amp; I then proceeded up to Wieltje <strike>Sidi</strike> Station &amp; detrained the balance of the troops &amp; then came back to St Jean Yard &amp; was releived at 8.15 am &amp; walked back to our Vans &amp; had breakfast &amp; turned in, as I was very tired, being up since 7 am the previous day.</p>
