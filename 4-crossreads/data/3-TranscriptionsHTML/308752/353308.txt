<p>Part II<br/>16th December, 1915, to 2nd. April, 1916.<br/>Work &amp; training in Egypt.<br/>(Started to write this) April 29th 1916<br/>Wednesday May 3rd 1916<br/>Continuation of diary</p>
<p>As far as I remember I ended my last brief account of my experiences since leaving Australia's sunny shores, on Tuesday 14th December last. It will be a hard matter this time to write this in a successful manner, as the heat is very oppressive, &amp; I am surrounded by millions of flies. Nevertheless I shall do my best. I think you will find in my last diary that we had just arrived at our second camp Serapeum.</p>
<p>Wednesday 15th December 1915.<br/>Serapeum is situated on the banks of the canal about half way between Suez &amp; Port Said. I am not very much struck with the place all one can see for miles &amp; miles is <u>sand</u>. Drilling will be very severs in this kind of country, it will take us some time to get used to it. Woke very much refreshed (after our very strenuous days work) ready to get at it again.  And solid work it was too, carrying stores &amp; gear etc. off a steamer to the camp. Very hard trudging through the sand with a heavy load on your back. Tucker not very much improved, beautiful moonlight night. The 18 men off the Beltana had a little sing song on the banks of the canal, the songs sounded very pretty &amp; sweet in the still air.</p>
