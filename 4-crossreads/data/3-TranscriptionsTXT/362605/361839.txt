Dear Dad, Mum & George,
Here it is Saturday night 9.15pm.  I have just returned from the Y.W.C.A. where I have been playing for a Dance.  The musician did not turn up so I was the only one that could play.  We go to a Dance every Tuesday & Saturday & a musical Evening every Sunday.  It is good pastime & there are some nice People & altogether we spend some good evenings.  I went with my Salisbury Friends the Edmonds to a Social & Dance last Tuesday & I played quite a number of Dances there.  I was feeling lively which is a rare state for me so I hopped in & kept the ball rolling as most of the people were on the dull side.  Of course I stayed over night & slept well although I had a feather bed.  I am writing in Dick's flat & using His paper etc.  He is away up at the mess & will be down shortly.  He is going away shortly up to London in connection with His profession.  We will miss Him rather much for He has grown into a very dear Pal.  He will be away about 3 months & will then be due for return to Aussie.  We have had an awful spell of clear icy frosty weather & in consequence the Hospital is in an awful mess.  More than 1/2 the pipes have burst & of course the Latrines can get no water & everything was frozen up until yesterday when the rain came.  I much prefer the wet sloppy weather for one can get warm then.  I am all alone now as Ellis has gone to London on Duty.
