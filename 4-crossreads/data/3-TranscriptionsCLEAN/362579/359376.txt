3rd Aust. Gen. Hosp.B.E.F.France.26.8.17
My dearest Mother,
Strange to say I'm in the same town, when I first came to France   &  next door to 1st 8th African Gen Hosp. - Everything is greatly improved   &  this is a very comfortable Hosp. I've had a move now, from the 3rd A.C.C.S. to the General.
Left Dorothy where I last wrote from but cannot say if she is there now. We came here Friday - took the whole day travelling by train. Sister Kelly   &  I got orders Thursday night to be ready next morning to leave at 9 a.m.   &  arrived here about 6.30 p.m. very tired out   &  down hearted. I daresay it is the best for us   &  no doubt you will all
