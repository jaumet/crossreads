<p>Joe Chamberlain's private house and we are treated with the greatest of kindness they are all ladies in here and we have plenty of visitors come in to see us. We are having a good time alround.<br/>I had a letter from old George Reid the other day wishing me a speedy recovery and also saying that if I need anything to let him know. he is very proud of the Australians now. Everybody makes a great fuss over us now. Paper men come round and want us to tell them yarns about Gallipoli<br/>When we get well we have 14 days leave and I have 5 invitations already to stay with</p>
