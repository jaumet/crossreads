 May 4th Last night was practically quiet, but at daylight this morning big shells started to fall all around the Transports, &amp; shrapnel burst over several.  We had 5 or 6 fall very close to us, so we decided to back out a bit.  All the Transports have been lying close inshore for over a week, now we have to shift further back, so I don't like the signs.
