<p>in our huts.<br/>Sat up late tonight playing Bridge &amp; after that we made some tea &amp; showed one another tricks &amp; etc with string &amp; so on<br/>21st  Jock Mackie went away as billeting N.C.O. this morning.<br/>The company had a bit of stiff luck again today   hanged if No 9 platoon did not have an accident with bombs again   one chap had his hand blown off &amp; hit all over, the steel helmets saved the other chaps life for a certainty for the pieces of steel went right through the steel &amp; entered the skull if it had not been for the helmet he would have been killed as dead as a door nail, lucky there were not more casualties</p>
