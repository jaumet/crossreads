Friday 3 [2] August 1917 [1918]Town 4 p.m., shopped for N. Woods.  Pt. 200 sent.All goods high prices just now viz., 1 pr. satin bedroom slippers, Pt. 30 (6/-).  Tea Liptons with Kinnaine & Manning, garry drive home (Pt. 15).  Lovely evening light & days already growing less hot.  House we live in is one of the oldest about.  These barracks were built in 1801 or thereabouts by Napoleon & are over 120 years (perhaps 1790 odd) & ours they say before then.  No wonder it seems to be crumbling away to ruin & is full of fine dust.Hear Gen. Cox has gone up the line, another stunt coming on.
