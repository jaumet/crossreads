Friday Mar. 2 [no entry]Sat. Mar. 3.  Busy day in Blanket Store.  Got 2 patients to assist me & we put in some good work.  After Tea went to see 5th Div. Concert in the Church Army Hut.  They used our Stage & Hargrave assisted.  Wrote long Letter to M.S.  Got word that Col. Williams was severely wounded.
Sunday Mar. 4/17  Glorious day.  Aeroplanes about in droves.  5th Div. Band played for Church Service.  Fine music.
Mon. 5.  About 40 of the 8th with Maj. Wooster & Capts. Irving, Catford & Riley marched to Edgehill & attended the funeral of Col. Williams.  It was a very simple ceremony & he was put in a trench just the same as a Private.  The  Night birds" got another knock tonight.  Bob Roberts is going to the Anzac Show, so we are left without a Producer.
