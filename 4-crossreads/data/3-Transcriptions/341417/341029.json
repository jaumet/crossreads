<p>Dear Mother.<br/>Just a line to let you know that I am still well hoping all at home are the same. Things are quite the same here now only duck your head to a few Jack Johnsons which whizz about now and again but they are quite harmless here. Well good bye &amp; love<br/>From your ever loving Son<br/>Will. Reece.</p>
