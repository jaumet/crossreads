 20 Dec, 1916 Bayoud Perce Barrow &amp; 8 of the troop went out on a patrol to Ruesatt 5 or 6 miles out East.  I was with Parky, we had a very quiet &amp; pleasant day.  The boys were nearly all on out Post when we got back &amp; before we had tea it was dark. These days are beautiful; there is much more colour about now.  The skys are blue, &amp; clouds white &amp; fleecy, the sand has lost its glare &amp; looks a soft greyish white; the mornings &amp; evenings come &amp; go attended with rich colour, not like Gallipoli with its glorious blaze at the rising &amp; setting of the sun but quiet rich beautiful colour.  Just the difference between wild mountain scenery &amp; quiet green grassy paddocks with sheep &amp; cattle grazing.
