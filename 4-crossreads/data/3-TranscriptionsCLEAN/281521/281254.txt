  
 4/5/17           L'Homme Mort 2.30pm  Colonel of 2/8 W Yorks told me he gave a platoon orders to go to Factory and make a strong point there. They are now entirely missing. Aeroplane reported seeing some going into the Factory so God knows if they are still there. The 185th had a muster parade before getting ready to move out. One battalion had 300 who had been carrying the others ran out at about 38, 58, and so on per battalion. 3.45pm The General commanding the 20th Bde arrived and wished runners to our Bde HQ but subsequently changed his mind and went back by car to Divnl H.Q. at the Monument. They are evidently having another cut at the village  what a price to pay for putting too few men on at first and for leaving that damned gap between Corps. Guns fairly quiet today compared with yesterday. Weather like summer hot & close and a haze mostly gun smoke about. Loss of direction by English the other morning is largely attributed to the smoke of the barrages blowing back on to them like a thick cloud. 186th had nothing fresh to tell us this morning.
