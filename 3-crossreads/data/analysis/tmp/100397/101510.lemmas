 him when up at Overstand . Do you rememb the Comfort that Kitti gave me , it was the onli thing left in my Kit bag . the sheep skin jacket was gone . I think all those articl were comand by the Militari author they were want in Franc . I will get there for the tail end of the winter so dont mind so much I dont like the cold and wet combin . I would sooner get a blighti than trench feet . a lot of our men were sent across suffer from that complaint , and it no good . I must stop and tri to write a coupl more letter . Dont let yourself worri about me too much I hope to be home for next Xmas dinner I had to tell Mrs Horton not to worri . she did not think it fair that men who had been wound should go back . Heap of Love to all especi yourself from your Love Son Chas Next letter may be from Perham and may be from Franc
