 My dear old Jane, So delighted to receive two letters from home last Saturday, one from Al, Dec 7th & the other from you Dec. 13th - they are both nice newsy letters. So glad the birthdays were a great success & that you all liked the presents I sent. Hope Xmas was a happy time for you all. I told you in the previous letter how I spent Xmas & new Year. This year so far has flown & the days are not nearly long enough & my strength not strong enough to do half what I wish to. Anyhow, it is better the time should go swiftly than hang heavily on ones life. I have been going out a good deal lately. I seem to get a number of invitation & this climate makes one very restless, such a number of interesting places to go to & the weather is beautiful now, one cannot settle down to write.
