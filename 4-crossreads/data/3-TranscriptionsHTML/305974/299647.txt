<p>14 Thursday<br/>A very cold morning, the coldest I have experienced for a very long while, well in fact it was very cold all day.  I had a tooth pulled out in the morning, now my gum is rather sore, it was a very long tooth &amp; took a good while to pull it.  A &amp; B sections went for a route march in the afternoon, on account of my tooth I didn't go.  Rained all the evening, mud is everywhere.</p>
<p>15 Friday<br/>Detailed to stand by for fatigue but none cropped up &amp; we hadn't anything to do all day bar read a couple of papers.  We get fatigues every other day.  C section took over the divisional baths last Tuesday.  It is a lovely day today after the rain.  The 4th Fld Ambulance played the 12th field, football in the afternoon which resulted in a draw, each scoring 5 points.  Went for a walk round the town in the evening with Billy Freeman.</p>
<p>16 Saturday<br/>Things were very quiet during the morning, did nothing but read.  The days are very cloudy &amp; cold now.  General parade held at 2 pm &amp; the latest style of gas helmet issued.  They are entirely different to previous issues &amp; it only takes 6 seconds to adjust them ready for a gas alarm.  Fell in 6.45 pm &amp; went by motor to Dickebusch (about 5 mls  We went through the gas at Reninghelst to test our new gas helmets.</p>
<p>17 Sunday<br/>We are now about 2000 yds behind the firing line, in the advanced dressing station.  Things seem to be very quiet here   a gas picket of 13 men has to be kept here, so as to give the alarm of gas.</p>
