<p>1st A.S.H.<br/>Egypt.<br/>Feb. 22nd 1915.</p>
<p>My dear old Belle,</p>
<p>It is very sad but I have not had an Australian mail for three weeks.  So you can just imagine how anxious I am to see a letter from Ilkley.  Suppose I shall have to have a little more patience and try to be contented.</p>
<p>We are all very happy here &amp; the weather is beautiful but think it is beginning to warm up again.</p>
<p>My movements are very uncertain at present but hope to be able to get back to Australia on transport in a few months.</p>
<p>Last Monday week seven of us, including matron, had dinner at one of the camps near by.  We had a lovely time and the boys were very delighted to have us &ndash; Believe they are arranging another one for this week but I'm afraid I wont be able to accept this time.  On Wednesday afternoon, Sister Boninely, O'Reilly &amp; self had afternoon tea with Fred at his camp</p>
