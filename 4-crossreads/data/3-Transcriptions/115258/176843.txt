<p>have been trying to ford the river and got two horses drowned. We take it in turns to take our horses down along the river banks grazing and this morning when Ted Edwards was out, a Turk came in and gave himself up - so Ted put him up on my old mare and brought him with great pride as as &quot;Sig troop capture&quot;. The Turk was a very harmless looking little chap and he had evidently been having a bad time as he told us &quot;Zarbit&quot; which means officer, and pointed to the turkish lines, and then banged him self over the head, so I suppose they have been belting him for something. A few Turks come in nearly every day somewhere along the line, but not enough to win the war on I&#39;m afraid. The beastly authorities this year are not going to issue us with shorts; in fact they wont even let us wear private ones - on account of some chaps getting septic knees from riding in shorts last year. I believe they are going to issue us with drill riding breeches! I dont think they will be much chop but will wait and see.</p>
