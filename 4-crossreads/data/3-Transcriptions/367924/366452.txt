<p>all I can say is that I would pitty him and every one else if it was worse, he is in good health and wishes to be remembered to both of you.

How is Eric Ashe getting along. I have not heard from Birts Wife for quite a while now. So Captain did not buy Incheys after all. I was pleased to hear that you had a good man at last, they must be very scarce home their now. We are hoping to get another mail any time now.</p>

<p>Jim Ladyman has not came back yet since he got knocked at Beersheba on 31st Oct but he is quite well I believe. Get Nell to show you the vasses that I sent her.
