 26 May 1918 Sunday Had dinner with Father George &amp; other priests at Salesian Monastery Bethlehem, a lot of politics are mixed up with Religion here &amp;   ecclesiastics go in for propaganda work like our R.Cs do.  Then saw the St Joseph's Convent girls play a Farce for the benefit of a French general &amp; staff rather amusing I enclose you programme. Sorry to see Studs like Cobran being sold up, I always liked those sheep.  Sheep are very healthy here &amp; brown &amp; colored wool fetch big prices for Persian carpets.  Camel Hair, Donkey Hair, Goats Hair all used for Clothing by Bedouins.
