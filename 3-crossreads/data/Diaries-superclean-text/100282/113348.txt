This afternoon I went for a short walk down the little valley, everything showed the signs of Autumn, the trees slowly shedding their golden russet leaves gently floating down in the cold still air covering the grass which is fast turning yellowish, with a brown layer of leaves the old trees looked very bare with the pale sunlight flooding the countryside only here there could be seen a few hardy flowers which still hung out in spite of the cold winds frosts, never the less the old valley had a certain kind of beauty which was unmistakable it must be a very beautiful little spot in Spring Summer a delightful place to spend a little holiday in, so quiet peaceful far removed from any big town. Salvecques is one of those quiet little French villages that still lie buried far from the roar rattle of the busy towns railways kinder people it would be hard to find once we get away from the war zone the difference in the people we meet is remarkable
