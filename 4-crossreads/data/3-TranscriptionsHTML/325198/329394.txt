<p>4 Nov, 1916<br/>Hill 70<br/>Brownie has the chair at the tent he is talking school &amp; footer.  The latter is booming here at present.  A &amp; B sqds played C.sqd this after noon, there was no score but it was a great game.  C is squeking, a good sign.  The horses are fresh though they dont look too good; usually when we are going to water about half a doz get loose.  We were duty squadron to day &amp; its not much chop, we had hardly enough men to take the horses out.  I feel as much inclined to writing as flying; wish they would move us somewhere thought dont have any longing to go out El Arish way.  There is talk of a move shortly but I dont think we will move out, fancy we'll go the other way.</p>
