<p>one is going to cop out.<br/>I have just finished an extra heavy list tonight of Dental parades.<br/>14th.  I had an astonishing big parade for Dental this morning this was on account of yesterdays disturbance &amp; there was also a big Orderly Room for one thing &amp; another &amp; I was an unwilling witness on a lot of the cases, though my evidence got a lot dismissed so that was not so bad.  This dentist has got the wind up me each time I go down he says after looking at my teeth, "right oh Sgt. I won't touch you today, its too big a job just at present," so thats sounds promising.<br/>15th.  Very hot again today, but one can notice that the evenings are getting much more chilly &amp; nippy that's how I like them</p>
