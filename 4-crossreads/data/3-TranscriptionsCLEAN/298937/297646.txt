  
 yesterday, but as usual the thing was spoiled by a lot of the remainder breaking camp. We were supposed to have had leave today, but as about 200 men are missing we have not been granted it yet. We hope to get out at 2 p.m. I hear that a German submarine was chasing us not far out of Marseilles;  a French merchantman had a brush with one & a transport following us.
