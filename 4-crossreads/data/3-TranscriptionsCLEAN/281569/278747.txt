 Feeling very crook & to make matters worse jaundice had broken out, vomiting still bad & pain pretty severe, propped up in bed, the boys called round but were not allowed to see me. 
 26 October, 1916 Thursday 
 Feeling slightly better pain easier, had a fair night, wrote two letters, another Australian admitted with a bad foot.
