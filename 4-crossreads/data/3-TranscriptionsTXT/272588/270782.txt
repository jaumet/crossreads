Tuesday 8 OctoberLeave London.
Wednesday 9 OctoberArrive in Edinburgh on a wet day but still can do the Castle, Royal Mile & the Holyrood Palace, all places abounding in history.  The Royal Mile however, loses all its historical beauty, by the awful condition of the people living there. George Hotel.
