  
 23-12-16 hour & it was looked forward to, to warm us up; We followed the Wady all night & at daylight pulled up just north of Maghaba. Here we met the I.C.C. & the New Zealanders & 3rd L.H. Bde soon came on the scene, also a Battery of Artillery,  the Indian Camel Corps also a Battery of Indian 9 pounders. The 1st Regt was in reserve. The New Zealanders & 3rd Bde commenced the ball rolling by opening out & galloping around the Turks position, & the 2nd & 3rd Regt of this Bde soon followed; 4 of our aeroplanes was out early & gave us the exact position of the Turks by dropping bombs on them; It was a fine sight to see the Troops galloping into position & the rattle of machine guns
