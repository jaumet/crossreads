<p>Still anchored at <strike>Salonika,</strike> went ashore for an hour, it is a pretty town of many colors filled with a Cosmopolitan crowd of Soldiers &amp; Cut-throats.  A big Roman Wall &amp; Tower show the old City <strike>now surrounded by Tents Stores Haneaks &amp; Soldiers- </strike> Olympus is covered with a Cloud like Table Mountain &amp; mule tracks lead over the mountains-<br/>( Following paragraph is crossed out)<br/>Police are everywhere &amp; it is not wise to express your opinions  Many gunboats in the Harbour have their guns trained on the town a Hostile Plane flew over but did not drop any bombs- as usual all lights are out &amp; we are not allowed to even have a Concert in the Saloon</p>
