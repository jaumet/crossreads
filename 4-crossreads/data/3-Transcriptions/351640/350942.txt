<p>letter came from Ted this afternoon.  Mrs Parsons is good to call for you in the motor, she should be well off when the old man has passed in his cheques.   I hope so.  Please thank her for being so good to you.</p>
<p>I should like to see the red tipped leaves from the gum tree as they are arranged in the bowl on the landing.   A letter from Pat Watt came this afternoon, please thank her for writing it, she is a clever little woman.   Good.   Glad that Tabby had a day up the harbour with the Bridges.  Yes I shall be very sorry if you leave Macquarie Street, it is a desireable place to live in, and all my books and other material are fitted in there, but more about this and 211 on a separate page as they are purely business matters.</p>
<p>11.10 p.m.  Captain Plant has just come in and he is reading the articles that you sent on the sheets of the Sun, and a poem by Marion M. Knowles.

It was written in a paper lately that the British government had told the Commonwealth that for the remainder of the war government money must be fund [found] in Australia.</p>

<p>Caggie dear:  Glad that you though my letters to be interesting, the Matareiah subject should please the readers of the Catholic paper, if the Press cares to publish my notes about it.   Prof. Watson comes from Adelaide, he is an M.D. of Paris, but how he ever obtained the degree I never have been able to understand, to do so one had expected the possessor to talk French fluently, this he cannot do, I have known him for a long time but he has always been a kind of mystery to me, I have not see[n]</p>
