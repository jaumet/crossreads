the Division on its appearance.Monday Dec 2Inspection by Gen Chaytor today. Gen Chaytor is in command of the Australian & New Zealand Mounted Troops on this FrontTuesday Dec 3We had a Donkey Polo match to day. It was the funniest thing I have taken part in for a long time. The little Grey Donks seemed to enter into the fun & when the feed up whistle blew they all cleared out for home & ended the game. Auckland Reg are holding a race meeting tomorrow to pick out the best for the Div Races.
