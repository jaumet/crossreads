<p>We had a frightful dust storm here just a day or so before we left blew most of the tents down &amp; darkened the sun   Oh she was a beauty everyone was nearly blinded with the rotten stuff.<br/>After it had all finished we had a shower of rain which was a Godsend as it cooled the air &amp; laid the dust, we were expecting orders to move any day now &amp; we were waiting anxiously for the word to come for us to pack up, so as we could get out of this hole, this made the 4th continent I had been on, we only want to see the States now &amp; we would be quite globe trotters</p>
