<p>Tuesday April 24.1917<br/>A beautiful day.  The sky is blue &amp; clear, and the Sun is shining out bright &amp; warm.  Fritz put over 4 shells this morning, two of them close to the Q.M. store &amp; two in our old billets at 11.30 square.  after breakfast he put over about a dozen.  He seems bent on destroying Armentieres before evacuating Houplines.<br/>Throughout the morning he continued to put in more shells, &amp; by dinner time must have put over fully 30.  Enemy aeroplanes were about all morning but very high up &amp; just about 12 one of our planes succeeded in bringing one of Fritz's down, admidst great excitement &amp; rejoicing of the people who exclaimed "Tres Bon" very good.  Bon English.  The plane came down almost vertically &amp; at an acute angle, &amp; I believe fell in his own lines.<br/>[Shorthand entry not transcribed]<br/>Later news to hand says that the enemy plane fell in our lines &amp; burst into flames before falling.</p>
