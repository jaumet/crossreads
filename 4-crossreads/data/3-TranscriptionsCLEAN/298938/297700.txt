  
 Sunday 3rd Sept 1916 No letters from Lily since arrived back, nor from Hammonds. Billy is going to town tomorrow & I hope to go for next week-end. Went to see "Within the Law" on Thursday last, but of  yesterday afternoon went onto Tidworth per motor (traction engine). Bought 9 rolls of films for the V.P.K. camera which I have bought for 15/-. I have also bought today, some printing frames & dishes, but I shall not take these away with me.  They can keep them for me at home.  3/6 was not dear for them
