15 August 1918ThursdayA fairly heavy sea running and rather a heavy swell. Weather cloudy and inclined to be wet - just a little rain! Boat only doing about 8 miles per hour owing the heavy head wind & sea.
1918 August 16FridayA very nice fine day & a beautiful sea with just a little roll. Nothing important happening on the boat. Another concert at night to cheer the lads up. Good war news. Reported 30,000 prisoners & 1,000 Guns since 4-8-18
