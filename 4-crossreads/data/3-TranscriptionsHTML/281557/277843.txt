<p>]<br/>Saturday : Jan 29th<br/>a fine clear day : cold morning &amp; night : revellie 6 am. physical before breakfast : while out on physical drill we doubled over to a camel corps that was passing &amp; and it was very interesting thousands of them &amp; the natives have complete control over them : they get down &amp; up again at a word from the rider : the tin affair on their jaws seemed to me to be a bit on the cruel side ; altogether it was a weird looking mob : done nothing after brekfast ; went to zoo in afternoon &amp; had a good trip. It is very big &amp; there is a splendid collection of birds &amp; animals. There are two pontoons there where the turks attempted to cross the canal last year : they are bullet &amp; shot ridden : the kangaroos have all been presented by the Australian "boys". The "Hippo" was a beauty &amp; came out of the water at the keeper's bidding &amp; also went back again when told. The crocodiles were nasty looking : the giraffes splendid while the monkeys &amp; pelicans ran a dead heat for first prize on the humorous side : taken all round it was a good interesting outing : came home &amp; finished the evening writing : the tram journey was also interesting : we crossed the nile &amp; the bridges were fine &amp; of the "swing open" type. In the zoo there is a splendid suspension bridge over the water about fifty yards long &amp; it is very pretty : bought some P. Cards at the Zoo</p>
