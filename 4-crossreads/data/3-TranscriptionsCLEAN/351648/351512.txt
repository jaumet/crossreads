  
 imputation of gluttony must ever rise in your mail again (such as you once dared to cast at me). 
 Was very delighted "comme toujours" to hear from you two days ago and I often send brain waves of thanks to you on receipt of papers, magazines &c. with the magic Tog in my corner, do you ever feel these Psychic messages?  But as pleased as I was to get your letter, there was that in it to wound my "amour propre" & to  wither  clamp my conceit & self complacency in it you remark that you have lost your heart to a Colonel & gloated on your rise up the military ladder having started with & had only Privates "not even a Lance Corporal".  Really Mrs. J.! didn't you know that my rank was Captain's?  I had hoped at least that with Dr. Barrington & others I --- But no I didn't, I didn't dare!!  (Run away you boys as Alison would say).  Ah well! tis kind to be cruel sometimes.
