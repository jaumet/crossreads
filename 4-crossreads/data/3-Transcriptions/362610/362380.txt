<p>Tuesday 13 1916<br/>At midnight all had to stand to &amp; soon after the artillery started to breach the enemy parapet. Raiders went out &amp; we afterwards heard that they took 6 prisoners &amp; a machine gun &amp; only had 2 of their men wounded. Our trenches were shelled &amp; I did not enjoy my first taste of it, altho' we received no casualties. Was on was from "Stand down" (3 a.m.) until 7, &amp; after breakfast tried with but little success to get some sleep.<br/>On in the afternoon until 9 p.m. &amp; then turned in until "Stand to" at 2 a.m. Capt. Cotton away in Sailly : Lt. Hunter killed by sniper abt. 4 a.m. A most miserable wet day with short breaks only when rain was not falling : worse than ever underfoot. Very little artillery "straffing" during the day, a few shrapnel shells only being burst over our communication &amp; some St.E.s used in searching for a concealed gun behind us.</p>
