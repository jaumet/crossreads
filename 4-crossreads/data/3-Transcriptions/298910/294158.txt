<p>Theirs an immortal fame,<br/>The deathless name of Anzac<br/>That thrills from Pole to Pole,<br/>The remnants of the heroes<br/>On the long &amp; glorious Roll.<br/>And now in their tens of hundreds<br/>Come the men to fill their ranks,<br/>And what can we do to show them<br/>Our love, our pride, &amp; our thanks?<br/>We can't do much (I own it),<br/>But give them a passing cheer,<br/>While the real Elite beat a shocked retreat<br/>Why, they saw one drinking beer<br/>Oh God, Could we show these misers<br/>The path that the Anzacs went,<br/>Could they rest in their beds at night time?<br/>Or sleep in their damd contemp?<br/>Could they talk with a sneer of Australian<br/>When one or two get drunk<br/>I'd rather a drunk Australian</p>
