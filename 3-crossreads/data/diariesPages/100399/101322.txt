Here we turned in until morning slept through the most terrific gunnery until 5 am when we moved to the Aid Post.

The villages of Contalmaison Pozieres were simply levelled the High Wood bared of all but a few stumps.

Last night the 1st 3rd Brigades charged established themselves on the outskirts of the village of Pozieres, Contalmaison being already in our hands, but with heavy casualties. Our work was hard we suffered about 20 casualties including three killed. Dock Bantry both being wounded (Rest to memory.

Aug 4th General Birdwood to-day spoke to a party of us individually, told us that to-night the second attempt by the 2nd Divn is to be made to gain German trenches. He is indeed a fine chap speaks to men as affably as if we were on the same plane as himself.
