<p>10 30 A.M. both ships proceeded in N.Ely. direction giving New Ireland a wide berth.<br/>We found about 250 other prisoners onboard, some having been here 5 months. We are all housed on the No 4 tween &ndash; decks, sleep in hammocks &amp; hot as hell when everybody is chased down below. Spent a most unpleasant night amongst sailors, firemen &amp; riggers all in a state of dripping perspiration.<br/>7th Aug.<br/>10 A.M. ships altered their course to N.W.<br/>200 pm. Both vessels stopped to allow "Matunga" to clean tubes, as she was getting very poor speed.<br/>530 pm. Went ahead again about W.N. W.<br/>From 8th to 13th August proceeded about West, nearly on the Equator. Had permission to sleep on deck at night while the tween-decks were being painted out.<br/>Always 3 armed sentries on guard over us, whether on deck or down below.<br/>Food at times is bad, but the bread is the worst, just like chewing dough, otherwise things might be worse.</p>
