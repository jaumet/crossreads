<p>Tuesday 17th April<br/>My 29th birthday &amp; I begin to feel that I am getting old.  With good fortune I may be home for my 30th. But it does not give me much time to work up a business before touching 40 &amp; previously I reckoned on having something good by 30.  Yesterday was wet &amp; cold but went for a walk after tea to "Thiepval" about 3 miles from here &amp; was very pleased I did so as t'was wonderfully interesting, so much so that I determined to go again.  Coming home saw three lengths of 3'' rubber<strike>y</strike> piping so we confiscated it for the baths.  Followed the railway coming home &amp; had a perilous walk on the wet sleepers where it crossed the lagoon, rather wet by time I got home.  Fixed up the pump this morning with the hosing we carried home &amp; find it a great success just about halveing the work.  Set off for Thiepval after dinner arriving back after six having explored all the fighting area of this locality.  The shelling must have been truly awful &amp;</p>
