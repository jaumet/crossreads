6/7/17 Beaulencourt
A busy day. First parade 9.30-12 devoted to specialist training, the riflemen doing shooting on the range and the hand rifle greneadiers used live stuff. Fulton had his gunners all out. Reconnoitred and allotted the ground for a stunt tonight and left the company commanders to make the necessary dispositions. After lunch rode off to Bancourt where all C.O.s were assembled. Generals Smythe, Gellibrand and Smith were there. The two former with pennons lancer. Smythe spoke of our going into the GHQ Reserve and gave the details of a Divisional attack on Monday next. We then set off and made a reconnaisance of our line of advance ? a very pleasant and delightful afternoon. Rode home and then got ready for a night stunt. The battalion marched out at 8.30 p.m. into night outposts and then withdrew to a flank and formed up on a J.O.T. on a front of 450 yards. It worked rather well. Bed 12.45 am.
