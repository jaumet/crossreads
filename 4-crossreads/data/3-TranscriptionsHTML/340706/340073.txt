<p>morning a search was made for articles &amp; although both McKenzie &amp; Sheehan knew they were in my room yet ignorance of French prevented their saying so. So they were found in my room &amp; as several things have been stolen they imagine they have discovered means of ingress &amp; egress of theif.</p>
<p>About 2.30 pm Town Major receives a note from Maire &amp; of course as interpreter I accompany him but no one knows what it is about. On entering the Tannerie which is where Maire spends all his time 2 women, the Maire &amp; a surly looking man all commence speaking at the same time &amp; had my interpreting powers to the utmost</p>
<p>Soon I gave up interpreting &amp; listened &amp; find that I am the subject of all this disturbance. I am now an excellent judge of French temperant &amp; never make a mistake. In the end I am invited to take wine with the ladies &amp; am shown all their treasure trove &amp; post cards. Their front room is chaos. Birds of paradise &amp; foxes and several good specimens are on floor &amp; in all sorts of corners.</p>
<p>However I spend a pleasant afternoon &amp; leave the best of friends with an invitation to see them again</p>
<p>19-4-19 (Sat)</p>
