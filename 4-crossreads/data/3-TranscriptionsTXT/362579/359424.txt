 Tell Eddy his parcel is lovely   &amp;  I shall give him a big hug   &amp;   kiss for them when I come home. It is grand to think one is not forgotten. Only I do wish I could come out to see you all. I shall make inquiries when I get to England. Thank you all for my Xmas Cake   &amp;  hope next one shall be with you all   &amp;  we shall enjoy it together. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Fondest love &amp;  kisses to you all. 
 From Yours lovingly Edith
