 In the Field 20-9-17. 
 Mr J. A. Edmonds Timor Blandford. 
 Dear Sir. 
 On behalf of the comrades of your late soldier son and myself his Company commander, I write to offer you our sincere sympathy. It may please you to know he died as he  lifed  lived, a white man, game, and doing his duty. An enemy shell ended his grand life on 29-7-17. He did not feel it, and now lies in a hero's grave on Messines ridge. We missed him, he was a grand soldier, and only hope to do as well as he did. 
 Yours sincerely H. Cadell 
 [Captain Henry Charles Cadell, 35th Battalion, killed in action on 20 October 1917.]
