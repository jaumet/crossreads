<p>In the Field<br/>20-9-17.</p>
<p>Mr J. A. Edmonds<br/>Timor<br/>Blandford.</p>
<p>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>On behalf of the comrades of your late soldier son and myself his Company commander, I write to offer you our sincere sympathy. It may please you to know he died as he <strike>lifed</strike> lived, a white man, game, and doing his duty. An enemy shell ended his grand life on 29-7-17. He did not feel it, and now lies in a hero's grave on Messines ridge. We missed him, he was a grand soldier, and only hope to do as well as he did.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>H. Cadell</p>
<p>[Captain Henry Charles Cadell, 35th Battalion, killed in action on 20 October 1917.]</p>
