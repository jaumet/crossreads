<p>18 June 1918 Tuesday<br/>Should be relieved today.<br/>We are going to stay another 4 or 5 days here &amp; then go into support not <u>out</u> of the Valley-   Shot a snake near my Bivy last night-   Many centuries ago the Romans had a stone Aqueduct to bring water from the Au&mdash;Wadi to our present Outpost which is a typical Stage setting for a Brigands Stronghold all Ironstone Rocks on the edge of the Jordan Valley- the aqueduct is now useless but we use the old Romans road.  Turks shelled Jericho itself last night &amp; dropped some bombs this morning on our watering place-</p>
