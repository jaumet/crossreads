<p>Wednesday Oct 9<br/>Division moved up on the hill today. We are moving to Amman tomorrow to open up a receiving station. We are practically down to half strength. The situation is getting alarming. It is just as well we beat the Turks before the Malaria got a hold. Otherwise we may have been up against it. Five of the boys lost their lives today through examining a bomb they picked up. It exploded with disastrous results. Bedouins from surrounding villages are here looking for plunder.</p>
