Dear Mother and Father.Moved again to-day. It was a frightfully windy day but bright sunshine. Two or 3 wagons got bogged at the start so I had a busy time rounding things up. We are at present billeted in a pretty poor place scattered all over the country. I have fallen on my feet as usual and have a very comfortable little room in the house of a dear old madame who speaks Flemish but understands a little French. We get on fairly well.
There are a lot of colds about but I am free from them. It is pathetic to hear conversations in husky whispers going on between the C.O. and Adjutant. They should be right in a couple of days. The C.O. is going on leave shortly. That will leave me in command of the show. I am glad he is getting his leave so soon; his wife is a perfect gem. Please let me know if you get a letter from her Mother. I took a great liking to her; she is a dear old soul.
Phyllis is a bit too fresh and has taken to pigrooting out of sheer ebullition of spirits. She insists on licking all my pockets and today tried to bite a piece out of my hand looking for sugar. I have her a good stable to-night and she is quite happy.Rochford is fit.I had better turn in now.Best loveYour affectionate son,C.R.Lucas.
