We have certain important German prisoners. Schultz, governor, Herr Mars his Secy., Hirsch, wireless expert & Herr Hansen, Lieut Weber & a son of a Samoan chief called Hioma. We get into Fiji on Wednesday Sept 2 & we immediately get down to coaling. When that is done at 1 a.m. on Sep 3, the officers go ashore. I alas cannot go, having to stay in bed. They have a riotous time in the hotel our German captives were quartered. In the bar were three fine looking Fijian chiefs who toasted the King in the presence of one our officers, then went with glasses refilled to the Germans who were sitting in another part of the room, called out "To hell with the Kaiser" & drained their glasses to the dregs. Tho' I was not able to go ashore, I managed to get a few things for the bairnies. We left Suva on Sept 4 (Friday) for Rabaul in New Britain, the seat of government for German New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville &  ... We rendezvous at Rossel Island with the convoy on Sept 9 & things are beginning to hum. Here on the Sydney, Encounter, 2 destroyers, 2 submarines, P&O Berrima troopship, Murex, oil ship, Koolonga, collier, Aorangi, store ship. Sydney & destroyers go on ahead, Berrima comes in our wake & the rest being slow are to come along later. The Melbourne has gone off on her own to destroy the wireless station at Nauru, a task in which she completely succeeded without any loss. It is not far to Rabaul & we get there at day break on Sept 11 & we know we are in for some warm work. There is to be no delay. A party of Naval reserve men numbering 25 rifles sent under Lieut. Bowen to capture the wireless station nine miles in the bush. They are soon in difficulties & the first supports are sent up under Lieut. Hill R.N.R. with men from the Yarra & Warrego & the second lot under Lieut. Cmdr Elwell. Bad news begins to trickle in. We have had severe losses & had a bad check, but the story will probably be best given in the words of the Admiral's communication to the fleet on the 12th - "The object of operations yesterday was the capture of the Wireless station at Kabacaul, this was successfully accomplished by the Naval Brigade under Cmdr Beresford
