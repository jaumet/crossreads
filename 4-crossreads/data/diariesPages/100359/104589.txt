Joy Koller, B.K. , Dick Scholer, and a party of C. Section arrived to assist us in running the baths. Got a letter from Kath. Also a snapshot. Commenced to write to Lill.
Monday 31st
Quite busy today, plenty coming in for baths and a big rush for clean uniforms. Finished writing my letter to Lill Got another letter from France, that makes 3 this mail. After tea, Mac, Frank Newton, Jemmy Woods and I, paid a visit to a house near by. There was a piano, and a chap out of R.E's could and did play it very well. A party of N.Z. were there also and we had a most enjoyable time. Selection from Operas and some real "slap up" singing. Then we adjourned to a farmhouse near by where we got some very good homebrewed beer. The women folk were doing the washing. They had a dog working a big fly wheel, which in turn worked the washing machine. It struck me as a jolly good idea ? for the women ? but a bit rough on the dog. 
August 1st
Fritz sent a few shells over, which dropped uncomfortably close to our baths. Pay Day.20 F. Went to our friends place at the farm and had another sing-song. Plenty of shells flying around the village. Baths kept busy.
Wednesday 2nd
Last night the crowd were very noisy, coming home at all hours. Bricky Howard was very indignant, because some men came too late and couldn't get a bath. He took his blankets and slept out in the paddock where the girls woke him up this morning on their way to work. C.Sec. got orders at mid-day on their way to work. C.Sec. got orders at mid-day to pack up and report back to Headquarters.
Thursday 3rd
O Lord we've got to leave our "appy ?ome, tomorrow. Another busy day in the Baths. This morning about 5, Jemmy Woods and Rass both got up. There was a pool of water near their bunk, and each was blaming the other for causing it.
