On telling M'slle of my trip she said "What about the hare?!" so I arranged to dine with them tonight. She was making pancakes (called gallots) one at a time in a sort of press which she held over the fire. These people live well as regards food but bodily cleanliness is not their strong point and baths are rare. Had a splendid dinner at 7.30 and plenty to eat and drink till 10.30 with Fernand, Raoul, Marthe, M'slle & Gorman. Becaisse [becasse] and lievre were the pieces de resistance. With [indecipherable] beer & Burgoyne we made revel. These Belgians eat tremendously and cook well.
