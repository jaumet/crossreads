<p>Dear Mrs Robertson</p>
<p>I thought you might like to know something about the last of poor old Sammy Wilson who I know was a great friend of both you &amp; your husband.  He was in command of C Company during the assault of the Lone Pine position on 6 August &amp; got over to the enemy trenches safely &amp; was doing great work there with a few men when by some means or other he got separated from them.  He went on by himself &amp; was confronted by a party of seven or eight Turks &amp; he shot three but was then shot through the head &amp; killed.  He is buried at a place marked on the official maps as "Brown's Dip" (after Lt. Col. Brown, C.O., 3rd Bn. who was also killed on 6th August) &amp; his grave is marked with a cross with his name &amp; rank on.  Poor old Sammy, he was a ripping good chap &amp; we, of the 4th Bn., who have been so far spared, felt his loss very much.  He was just going to be made a Major too.  The 1st Inf. Bde. are being given a rest on a neighbouring island in a day or two &amp; its high time too, we are the merest shadow of a brigade now &amp; one &amp; all are</p>
