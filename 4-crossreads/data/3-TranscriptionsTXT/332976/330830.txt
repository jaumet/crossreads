We are to do our own cooking &amp; I am setting myself up with the "cook" in the cookhouse, which is fitted up with 2 bunks &amp; rather comfortable. 31st   This morning we started work with a fatigue party of 40 infantry from the "details camp," &amp; during the day dismantled 4 huts, just above the cemetary where Smith is burried, &amp; stacked them alongside the roadway The day has been very dull &amp; drizzling rain has been falling, with a strong &amp; cold wind blowing. We received news to-night that the lads have taken three villages up on our front &amp; are pushing Fritz very hard.
