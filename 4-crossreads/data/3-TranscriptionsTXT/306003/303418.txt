6-7-16Thurs 6thWhile doing stables this morning Sig Law called me to say the line was disconnected & I started off to fix it, but as the wires were all tangled up & there was loose ends everywhere where our line was broke I could not locate the right one & arrived back late for breakfast after putting a T onto the 3rd L.H. lineI had just finished breakfast when a Taube was sighted & we had orders to file out, I saddled up & took a phone (out of order) to Brigade
