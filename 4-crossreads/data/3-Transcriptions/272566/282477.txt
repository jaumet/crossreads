<p>Saturday 3 February</p>
<p>Managed to get a fairly soft job, that of loading motor ambulances every afternoon with patients for the Casualty Clearing Station.  It only takes about &frac12; an hour daily.<br/>The spare time I had today was occupied in strolling round Albert.  Shells come over pretty frequently.</p>
