 1916 &nbsp; MONDAY 4 &nbsp; SEPT. 
 Fine, but came onto rain in evening. Out with the signallers all day, but it was too wet for a lamp parade at night. All the boys came back from Winchester at dinner time. They learnt nothing down there. In fact I think we learnt more here. Anyway I hope we settle down &amp; learn something now. Posted my [&quot;?&quot;] &amp; letters to Linda &amp; Father &amp; Jo.
