10/6/16A quiet night. Today there does not seem to be a war on at all. The fact that we stay under cover as much as possible; alone, goes to show that the Huns are within range of us. We were detailed into fatigue and carring parties for the 'line' I go up tonight.11/6/16Went out to the firing line last night. Received my baptism of fire, in a strafe that was going on. It was the healthiest fright I have ever had in my life. I lay in a stinking drain, almost entirely submerged in mud and water for a quarter of an hour, while shells shrieked and crashed and machine gun bullets mowed the grass about six inches above my head. One of the party was wounded before we finished the job. Got back to billet, covered with mud, at 3 A.M.
