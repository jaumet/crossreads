Talking at BdeHQ. and fixed things to dodge being attached as a Staff Officer to Divisional Headquarters. Four FG CMartials to be tried here tomorrow so had a busy day overhauling papers and preparing case for the prosecution. Stayed close to tent all day reading and writing. Tomorrow a scheme for leave commences, 13 men to be allowed off at a time and to march to Staging Camp and there catch a train from Ismailia to Cairo returning at  1915 the same night. The whole scheme is a farce, the fellows will get full of beer, and get hold of a woman and never get back here on time. We have had no trouble up to date but from now on with this offences will commence. Being nearly killed by the march out they thought they were a hell of a distance from civilization, - now they can see its proximity. 
 Four men imshied last night. Horan was one. He has gone to the pack completely and is no good as a soldier and more trouble than he is worth. Late a barrister & solicitor of Dublin, soldier of fortune in South America and elsewhere he consorts with the lowest who look up to "Barney" as their leader. A splendid soldier in the trenches and an ex-Grenadier Guardsman, he has now lost his self respect. 
 Orders to push on with our bayonet fighting, and construction of swing targets. No materiel can be supplied & our orders are to make them. Red tape very bad higher up and make one think we deserve to lose the war. The transfer of a private soldier from the 7th Battn to this cannot be done without the signature of 2 Generals, one the Army Corps Commander. Quite ridiculous and opposed to KR 333 which vests the power in C.O.'s. Growing opinion here we are to go to Mesopotamia. Peart went up to Cairo today with all the paybooks and plenty of commissions to execute. Bed 2000.
