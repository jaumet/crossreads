whole of last night.  Church service held by Corp Cosier in mess shed, too busy to attend.
Monday 7.8.16Went on duty in motor to Estaires & Bac St Maur, returning to Estaires where I spent a couple of hours before returning.  Walked back, arriving at D.R.S. about 6 pm.
Tuesday 8.8.16In evening walked a mile or so along a country lane in Doulieu to look over an old windmill; very interesting.
Wednesday 9.8.16No variation in daily routine.  Taking advantage of opportunities & living very high; good news coming from all fronts; on the whole, in good spirits.
