16/2/19 Cologne
Got up rather early this Sunday morning and breakfasted over at the Officers Club after which had a shave and haircut there at the hands of Huns. Then met Corlette and walked down past the station to the Hohenzollern bridge where we caught a tram for Bonn. On the river were a few of our submarine chasers flying the white ensign. All the way along the bank of this fine Rhine are docks and several dredges. The electric tram soon took us out past capable looking factories in among green fields just like France and Belgium their poplar lined roads and rather bare wintry scenes. Our fellow passengers on the tram comprised some girls who giggled as all girls do. Arrived at Bonn after a rather uninteresting ride and walked up the streets. A fine town this but
