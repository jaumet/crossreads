  
  Wednesday 12th May.  Alongside water tank all day, no news from shore, warships silent.  At 7pm the Cape Hellis division of the fleet, commenced a very heavy bombardment against Achi Baba; they shelled the hills mercilessly for hours, the bursting shells lighting up the great impediment to the English army's advance, and presenting a magnificent spectacle.  Thursday 13th May.   As we had taken all the water we required from the tank we shifted back to our old anchorage near the "Queen" at 6.30am.
