Nothing but rumours latrines flying around they have got hold of all sorts of yarns, I heard someone saying that Fritz had got far as Baupaume had asked for an armistice, another one, that he has been knocked back pas Lagnicourt his old line, it was still going home, its funny but you always hear these sort of yarns whenever anything special is doing I have got that word to them that I take absolutely no notice of what I hear, not too much of what I see.
