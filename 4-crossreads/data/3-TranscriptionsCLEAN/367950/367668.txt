(3) Corpl C.H.Smith No 217Sometimes called "Smig" ( a corruption for Smith) a conscientious worker and reliable. very particular and careful about his belongings always takes the greatest care of his kit, horse saddle etc. prone to using bad language very frequently probably it will wear off as he gets older.
