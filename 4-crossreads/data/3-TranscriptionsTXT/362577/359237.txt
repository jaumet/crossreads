 Dear Auntie Babs 
 It's like my cheek calling you Auntie Babs, but it slipped out the first time and has stuck ever since.  Thanks very much for the papers, they go the rounds of the hut and are greatly appreciated.  There was an Australasian waiting when we came in to-day.  We started out this morning early with a snack in our haversacks and arrived in about an hour ago quite ready for late tea.  The whole of the third Division were inspected &amp; marched past General Monash the head of our division.  Unfortunately we are short of horses still so the 31st were one of the unlucky batteries and marched.  The inspection was held at Bulford about 6 miles away.  I've never seen such a crowd before.  It was worth seeing.  To-morrow the King inspects us so that means another long tramp.  It will be our first view of His Majesty.  We had four days leave about
