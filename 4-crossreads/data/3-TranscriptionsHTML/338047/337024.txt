<p>1919<br/>May 13<br/>to Westham Camp, where we were put into tents, as the huts were all full.  Our division was very lucky in getting this camp for a base, as the other divisions had to go to the Salisbury Plains camps.  After tea I went down onto the promenade.  A Sergeant from the 56 Battn said to me "Is your name Rose".  I said "Yes". He said "Mine is Haviland".  I couldn't have picked him out after 12 years, having last seen him at All Saints College, but I had evidently not changed much.  A lot of our men were still here.  Quota No 26 had not left, so we began to look forward to a rather protracted stay in Blighty.</p>
<p>May 14<br/>The next day I was issued with a few equipment shortages, &amp; was medically examined, &amp; also inoculated against the flu.</p>
<p>May 17<br/>On May 17 we were reviewed by General Rosenthal.  The review, which was held on the parade ground, behind the huts, went off very well.  After tea went out in a rowing boat.  During the first few days we were at Weymouth, we spent most of our time getting shortages etc.  In the afternoon we were free to go within  a five mile radius of the town.</p>
