 on a Sunny day.&nbsp; It is when we love France best.&nbsp; The sun is now bathing with its warm flood of light the early Spring flowers that grow wild in the wheat &amp; corn fields and the vines that  grow on  creep over rustic village cottages. 
 The little white crosses that adorn the graves of our brave comrades seem bigger, brighter &amp; bolder when skies are so blue and sun so golden.&nbsp; To all &amp; everything in France &amp; Belgium, my parting blessing &amp; my tears!
