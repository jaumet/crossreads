brought into us as a prisoner and under interrogation he said they had just been hurriedly bussed up from Ham and only came into the line last night. Their regiment evacuated the line opposite us at midnight. He was frankly fed up and declared Germany must lose the War. Sent a T.M. and a party for carrying the shells up to Chalmers. Spargo was the Corporal in charge of the party and was talking to him. A little later he was killed by machine gun fire. Chalmers now worked out until he had advanced his line  mile ahead of the 21st having several scraps and young Layburn was killed. Issued the necessary orders for Harricks to come up on Chalmers right and pushed up a Stokes mortar and a Vickers gun to cover his left flank Fritz was
