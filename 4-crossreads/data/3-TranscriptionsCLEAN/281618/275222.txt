The paw paws not being ripe , cuts up many in sampling & pulls off many more to fling at the monkeys. Cuts down a few bunches of green bananas; Also a few cocoa nut palms, in order to see if the young nuts are 'nearly ripe'  19. Finding that the only fruit ripe comes from up the country, proceeds to look for it, gets lost, & is found again by pitying niggers. 20.

Steals small "curios" such as items of kit, helmets' etc from the men of the garrison - ie (from their huts where they have made him welcome) and remarks that "the nigger troops dont seem to be afraid of losing their things - the way they keep them where anyone can get them if he wants to!"
