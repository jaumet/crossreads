Guillacourt
Another fine hot day. We were heavily bombed by enemy planes during the night. Just after getting up Colonel Duggan came over to see me. At 10.40 received a rush order from Bde. HQ. to move at once to the old French line up in front of Harbonieres and for myself to report to the General in the Pigeon House at that place. It seems this morning as if the 5th 7th Bdes got through OK in their attack but that the 3rd Division have been held up and are unable to go further. Saw the General at the Pigeon House ? a circular old tower dated 1656 in the courtyard of an old farm now very dirty from German occupation. The Battalion was now on the move and I rode out and met them and
