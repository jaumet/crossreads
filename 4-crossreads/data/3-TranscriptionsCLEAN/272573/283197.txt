and evening at the farm. We were picking hops in the hop field and in the evening watched the girls as they milked the cows in the barn.
This family consists of the father, mother, five girls, Marie Louise, Germain, Jeanne, Martha, Agnes, and one son Louis. The father & mother have brought the children up to be very methodical, each have their bit to do on the farm, Marie Louise and Germain look after the cows, Jeanne looks after the poultry, Martha does the general running about and Agnes being very young, only being three years old, has not reach the age of work yet. Amongst the multitudinous duties that she does on the farm, Emma, who has been twenty four years in the family as a servant, she looks after the piggery
When there work on the farm is completed, at night time they all gather round the large table in the kitchen and do sewing crotchet work etc,. each having a little work box of their own. I admired the way that this family was brought up.
The father and mother seem very hard working people.
Another 'plane came down in the field next the one that the other plane came down in.
