<p>of Dorothy Burnett's engagement to Russell Cowan. We are all delighted &amp; hope they will be married before Russell goes away, so that Dorothy may have a rest from monetary worries. I think things have been very hard lately.</p>
<p>Grandma has been very ill again &amp; I have been down helping to nurse her. She is wonderful the way she pulls through &amp; greatly surprises her Dr. Uncle Will came down on Sunday looking so well &amp; full of fun &amp; interest as usual. He says they enjoy your letters very much.</p>
<p>Marion sent on a telegram from Freemantle from Dene saying he was well. He did not call in at Melbourne which was a great dis-appointment of course, &amp; he is going round the Cape I expect.</p>
<p>Oliver cabled from Plymouth on 26th Augt. so Hazel expects a letter in about three weeks; it seems a very long time to wait for news &amp; is rather a dreary time for her. However</p>
<p>[The following text is written along the left-hand margin:]<br/>she is endeavouring to enjoy life &amp; not grizzle too much. We are so glad Dorothy has been writing such nice letters she hasn't been doing much else since Xmas &amp; now has come into town to learn typewriting in the same office</p>
