<p>Dear Colonel<br/>Your letter of 24th Dec to hand &amp; I can assure you it filled me with the greatest of pleasure to receive a letter from you. I am pleased to hear that your &amp; yours were well when writing &amp; I hope the receipt of this will find you all in the very best of health. So glad you found time to spare to run out to my home for I am sure Mrs G. would be greatly bucked up &amp; delighted to hear of me from you who had left me &amp; could give absolutely first hand information as to my health etc. &amp; I thank you heartily for being so kind. I am more than pleased to hear from you that my family were all so well. I quite follow regarding the fianc&eacute;e. Getting pretty old eh? seeing one of the family is running a fianc&eacute;e - &amp; I understand he means business. No the boy had not caught up to me prior to you leaving &amp; did not arrive until about the 13th December so is really enjoying a cook's tour seeing the world &amp; being paid for it but still it is not the lad's fault he came as soon as he could. I quite agree with you in your opinion regarding Mrs G not being in good health all the time but I cannot say for certain for some of them at home would let me know the real state of things but I am very much relieved &amp; pleased to hear through you that she was well &amp; cheery the afternoon you spent there. I hope that gave you a good welcome one similar to that which I would give you, for the many favours you done for me &amp; your kindly &amp; ever forbearing manner towards me on all occasions. I quite understand you feeling Colonel &amp; am not surprised that "A" &amp; "Ax" are still flashing through your mind &amp; that the sound of s "Donk's" chuckle &amp; the</p>
