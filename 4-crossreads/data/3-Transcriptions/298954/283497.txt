<p>1917<br/>decreases the raider's chances of getting a ship on this route.</p>
<p>Sat.  14th July<br/>A sail sighted at 8.30am.</p>
<p>Boarding party went on board and the vessel (a four masted schooner) kept in our vicinity.</p>
<p>Sun 15th<br/>The new prize hove to near the "Wolf" this morning and the work of trans-shipping the stores commenced in the boats.   Finally, the crew were brought over.   It is rather amusing to watch the new prisoners coming on board, especially the mixed collection from these Yankee lime-juicers.  The "Encores" crowd come up the ladder in their newest "shore clothes" and with many sea-bags.   Their expressions showed that they were undecided whether they were going to be shot at once or reprieved for a few days.</p>
<p>The vessel is the "Encore" of San Francisco Columbia-River to Sydney with lumber and case oil.   Crew of 10. Capt. Ohlsen.</p>
