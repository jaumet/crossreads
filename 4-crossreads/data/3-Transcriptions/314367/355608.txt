<p>Shortly after the Commander got very bad &amp; then we found the Chief Engineer was down &amp; the Pay was bad too &ndash; This of course meant a common cause &ndash; food poisoning &ndash; We had all had tinned herring &ndash; luckily only a small bit each &ndash; for breakfast &ndash; The C &amp; I were the worst &amp; when the Navigg. Lieutenant fell down on the deck I couldn't move &ndash; However I told my SBA what to do &amp; about 3.30 I was sufficiently well not to vomit &amp; got up &amp; went the rounds &amp; took charge &amp; then went to bed again &ndash; The C. was passing out pure blood so that'll show you it wasn't too good &ndash;Luckily I was prepared for sickness &ndash; my cots were handy &amp; my stretchers &amp; I got the sick taken on to the poop deck &amp; the Bosun (Mr Bumpus) took the Fantome up St Georges Channel &amp; past Herbertshohe &amp; there we anchored &ndash; Luckily the storm was over &amp; on Thursday we were on our legs again but neither the C nor I cd. go ashore &ndash; That's the danger of tinned food &ndash; 5 officers out of 9 put clean out of action &ndash;</p>
