<p>a good day at Charlestown looking round the sailors home, going for a walk and a good talk with Mr. Nicholls who is a warrant officer in the Navy. Both going and returning we had an hour to spend at Dumfirline so walked round the main streets.&nbsp;We also visited the Glen, which is Carnegies birth-place.&nbsp;These are really lovely grounds</p>
