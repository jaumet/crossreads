<p>as we were then second senior ship it was essential that as much coal as possible should be take on board  -  after completing with coal we again returned to the Heads on guard</p>
<p>Oct 31st  5A.M. "Sydney" entered the harbour and proceeded to place of coaling, and at 9 A.M. we again proceeded to the pier to provision ship - we were all awaiting orders to sail, consequently laying at anchor with full steam always ready in case of emergency it was of vital necessity that whenever an opportunity presented itself the warships should keep supplies of coal and provisions at their maximum</p>
<p>We again took up our duties at the Heads as guardship, and a rather exciting incident occurred at 4 P.M. when a steamer was observed by us leaving harbour and heading for the open sea, also she was flying the Dutch flag, - she had not obtained permission to sail, so our Captain ordered to return to her anchorage, she steamed a complete circle after which she came close up</p>
