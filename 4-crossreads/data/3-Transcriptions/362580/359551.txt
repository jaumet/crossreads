<p>My dear Belle,</p>
<p>An Australian mail leaves in the morning, so thought I would scribble a few lines to you.</p>
<p>Yesterday I received a letter from Alice dated June 5th &ndash; so it took longer in coming than <strike>Belle</strike> your's of 12th &ndash; Sorry to hear no dividend from Ice Shares this &frac12; year but really could not expect any under the present conditions.  Hope you are all getting on in the money matters, suppose you have a good deal of worry making things go smoothly with such extravagant folk to manage.  Anyhow, so far I've been able to get along nicely but trust we shall not have to get new uniforms, it will cost us a nice little sum if we do and of course I'm trying to save as much as I can.</p>
