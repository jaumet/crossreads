<p>baskets per day.  This evening, in company with Vet Sgt Bootle, visited a flour mill.  The real old kind, worked by the wind.  The sails about 30 feet long, conducted by one man.  He informed me, that he grinds 25 bags weighing 85 Kilos each per day.  The mill he said was 200 years old.  I saw 1804 and 1844 cut on some of the beams myself.  I went up the stairs, the mill was working, rocking like a ship at sea.  The fittings were mostly all wood.  Hundreds of these mills all over this country.  A most noticeable building in these villages are the Churches.  Butcher shops are few.  In each village is a Brasserie or brewery.</p>
