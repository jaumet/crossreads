Just got nicely into bed last night at 11.30 when we were all awakened to supply mess tins & straps also some saddlery that the 3rd Light Horse were short of as they had to leave here early this morning; They also took all our signalling gear; to-day we had horses issued to us; Went to the A.V.C. again this morning for a few minutes; After tea Les Peters & I went to the billiard room had a game & then went in to Heliopolis & wrote a letter at the Y.M.C.A. & bought a silk flag for 3/- on the way home; We are having an easy time here & discipline is not near as strict as the Adj. promised us it would be coming over on the Hororata
