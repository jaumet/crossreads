 In the even it came on to blow fresh and at dusk as we were proceed toward Gallipoli we sight a ship come toward us . We dive and prepar to attack when the ship came up . She was seen to be one of the old type of cruiser . We fire a torpedo , but miss , it be rather too dusk for a good shot . The same even 29.4.15 some ship was seen to be make our number in the mors code to tri and get us to answer or els come up close to them , but we were not to be caught like that as we knew there were no more English ship in the Sea of Marmora . This show that the Turk had good spi . Probabl E 14 . This night we lay on the bottom as we did not want anymor experi like we had on the previous night , so we select a nice littl bay on the European shore which we knew had a good sandi bottom , and there we lay in peac . The next morn the Captain decid to go down to Gallipoli to see if there were ani transport there which may have pass us dure the night . This meant a veri long dive , so we charg our batteri up to all it would carri . Dure the time we were charg the batteri we were all the time steam toward Gallipoli . When we were just out of rang of the fort we dive and proceed toward the harbour . There was noth there except a gunboat and a number of small craft . We spent an hour in tri to get a shot at the gunboat but without success . It was a beauti fine day and not a rippl on the water , and of cours everi time we show our periscop we were seen and the gunboat had time to alter cours befor we could get a shot in . After put in an hour we decid to go back to the Sea of Marmora , but just as we were leav the harbour a transport was come in escort by destroy . We fire our starboard torpedo but miss . We immedi turn a littl and fire our stern torpedo . On fire this torpedo we had to immedi go down out of sight , as the destroy were attempt to ram us . We show our periscop 5 minut later but there was no transport to be seen onli the destroy . We had to dive a long way on this occas , as we were follow by destroy who were tri to locat us . Howev we got well clear of them and came to the surfac ( at this stage our batteri was get veri low ) , and commenc to steam on the surfac with our gas engin , at the same time charg our batteri . We had been under way about half an hour when we sight four or five differ jet of smoke on the horizon . At first it was not certain whether these ship were go away from us or come toward us but it was not long befor we saw that they were come toward us from Constantinopl . These were six destroy escort two or three small transport . At this stage we had onli one torpedo left and as these were onli small transport the Captain decid to keep our onli torpedo for someth larger , but just show ourselv as much as possibl so as to frighten them . When they were about 2000 yard
