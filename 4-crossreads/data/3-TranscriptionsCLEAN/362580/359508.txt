On duty all day yesterday but received about 8 letters & one Argus from Australia, also a parcel from Agnes of soap & a couple of handkerchiefs.
To-day your letter & one from Ella - I got a parcel from Mrs. Swinburne - with a tooth brush, toothpaste, soap, powder, 1 small bottle of smelling-salts, butterscotch, & six handkerchiefs - so you see I'm very spoilt - Mrs Baynes sent me a handkerchief & a nice letter.  The Thomas family sent me 1/2 doz lovely handkerchiefs.  Sister Burke got the same, a card was in hers, I think the card must have dropped out of mine, the parcel was open.  I'm writing to thank all my friends for their kindness to me.  I told you Charity also sent me a very sweet handker -, so I'm well set up with handkeys & soap.  I have not received the parcel with bloomers in yet but most likely shall in a few days.
