5th Port L our old ark, left yesterday she deserves to get through, will try & get to dock somewhere & repair. All sorry as we’ve got a kindly feeling for the old ship & consider her lucky. She sure broke down, but had she not done so it is considered almost certain that the trap would have closed in on her. Also had she not finished up on the Banks, we would not have spent these good days on the mountain. Thus is she a lucky ship. Drill on the new boat pretty stiff – we’re not a damn bit like buccaneers now, by George. 
6th Getting settled in new quarters – a process similar to that to be seen in any big store. No pay for 18 days – all very broke. It hurts not to have the cash to get a few little souvenirs when we hit a place like this. The officer who has undertaken the doubtful task of re-organising & educating us Lincolnites has started battling with the Powers to get us a few bob, & expects to pay soon. He is a very decent chap. Lt. Bruce of the Aus. Engrs., when we came down the mountain, he says, his heart ‘was stirred with pity for us’ we looked about to the best imitation of troops ‘returning from a hard hammering in the trenches’ that he’s ever seen outside of France. All sorts of rumors on the ship but one does not believe everything these days unless it comes down officially.
7th
