<p>Monday, 1 January 1917</p>
<p>Posted notes yesterday with Photos of Turkish Officers etc., -  enclosed. Rough night &amp; No. 1 Pier &amp; a Steam Trawler are wrecked just like Anzac over again. Our efforts always seem so puny against the Sea &ndash; am Prosecutor on a Court Martial today.</p>
<p>Weather cleared up &amp; we have a sunny New Years Day.</p>
<p>Evening, 3 planes bombed Al Arish while Court sat. Some men stand up &amp; try &amp; photo, but I'll admit if I hear the bomb coming through the air I like to lie down &ndash; but in the sand bombs are more demoralizing than effective. DUST STORM blowing tonight everything sand, &amp; the Horses move &amp; are reformed.</p>
