  
 On  23rd  we marched from Caestre to Reninghelst, a long wearisome march and arrived at Reninghelst at 4.30pm. Camped in tents that night. A very stormy wet night. The next day 24/10/17 we went into huts & billets in Reninghelst. We messed at Officers' Restaurant, managed by Belgian women. Here we had plenty of omelettes - each egg about a franc. I bought 30 francs worth of Clunes & Torchon Lace for Jay. We were bombed here each night but luckily none fell on our quarters. We left Reninghelst at 5am 27/Oct & marched to a siding near  Vlamertinghe . Here we were issued with rum & as we had had no breakfast & had just had a long 5 mile march, it soon made everyone talk. 
 Some men collared two jars of rum. These could not be found by the officers looking for them - naturally in crowded carriages. Hence we had a great many very drunk when we detrained near St. Omer,
