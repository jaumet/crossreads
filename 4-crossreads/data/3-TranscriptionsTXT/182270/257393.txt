 Fine &amp; very warm. Got general 
 leave again till 8 pm. I bought 
 some things in the morning &amp; 
 went out to The Bertram&#39;s at 
 High Constantia with Major 
 Campbell for lunch. Lay out 
 under the trees yarning all 
 the afternoon. Came back to 
 the Grand Hotel for dinner. 
 &amp; back to the boat at 8 pm. 
 Found we were not going till 
 morning so five of us got a 
 car &amp; went for a run round 
 Sea Point &amp; back. 
 Enjoyed the stay in Cape 
 Town very much.
