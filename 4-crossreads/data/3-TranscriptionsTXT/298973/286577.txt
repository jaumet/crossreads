Poor old Dene has gone under, my pals letter does not give me any details, he simply tells me he attended Denes funeral from hospital in France, so he must have died of wounds, I am writing for more particulars and will let you have them when I get them. It is hard luck, and like yourself. I feel as though I have lost a brother. I am very sorry for his people and will write to them when I get particulars of his death.
