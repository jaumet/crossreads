<p>France<br/>22 July 16<br/>Dear little Tingsie,<br/>There is a dear little goat here which says "Fran Ba". (Mother please interpret.) &ndash; I was very glad to receive your nice little letter and hope you will write me another.<br/>Mummy told me you go to Dancing Class. How do you like it?<br/>There are such a lot of pretty flowers growing here. &ndash; Red Poppies, Daisies, Butter Corn Flowers and a lot of other pretty flowers. &ndash; Have you got a little garden?<br/>Every day we see lots of Aeroplanes flying in the sky. &ndash; They look just like very big dragon flies.<br/>With very much love and a lot of big Kisses.<br/>Your loving Uncle<br/>Fred.</p>
