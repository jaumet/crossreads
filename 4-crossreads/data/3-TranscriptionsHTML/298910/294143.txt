<p>Sunday  6/5/17</p>
<p>Cold but fine &amp; windy. Got orders to march to the lines about mid day. Relieved 1st 7th &amp; 5th Field Ambulance about dusk. 7th had some heavy casualtys &ndash; 14th had 45 killed or wounded 5th also got a rough time &ndash; I heard N. Hill got a nice blighty on the hand and knee.</p>
<p>Two of our fellows got knocked badly before we reached our destination. Went up to R.A.P. on the Bullecourt front, which is in a sunken Road &ndash; under observation &ndash; no cover &ndash; we all admit this is the limit &amp; the hottest joint we have yet struck. Gordon Highlanders and Devons came in on our left. Fritz observed them changing over &amp; gave us particular Hell. Going our very hardest all night. Had a good squad &ndash; B. Trail, P. McMahon, E. Hand &amp; self. We hope that the luck which we have always had will stick to us.</p>
