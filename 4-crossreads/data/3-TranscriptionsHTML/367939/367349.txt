<p>that is seems a long time since I left but I tell you it seems years to me I got a good bit of while cotton planted in me my hair now which I never had in dear old N.S.W. but never mind we shall have our revenge for all the dear old boys that are under the sod all round our dug outs. I am sitting with a bit of a light all alone in my little old dugout writing these few lines  &amp;  the roar of the big guns is terrific   &amp;  the small ones too.</p>
<p>my dear old rifle is my only friend here. Well dear Grace I will bring this short note to a finish but remember me to all your people   &amp;  don't  forget Knowles when you write to them with all love   &amp;  good wishes to dear little Mavis Ted   &amp;  yourself from your loving Brother Charles</p>
