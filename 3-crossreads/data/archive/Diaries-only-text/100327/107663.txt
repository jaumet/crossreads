a couple of old dames returning from market taking turns. Gaba Tepe lying quiet and peaceful with this lovely sea all around. Had steady climb back up road when a big 6" shell struck a foot below top of hill (a shade more elevation it must have caught us) and threw cloud of dirt upwards. We took cover to escape shrapnel which lashed round us like a summer storm. The gentlemen on the top of the hill at once commenced to execute a war dance and passing a verdict of "gordstruth" continued tea just as if it was not a miracle they were not all sent to eternity. 
1800 Word of expected attack on our right so all hands very alert. Machine gun slashing bullets past this place like flight of birds close following each other. The evening was fairly quiet except for rattles of machine gun fire and occasional shells from our artillery and warships Four men bathing knocked out by shrapnel. Night fairly quiet a few stray shells and flares of various kinds, rockets c finishing off Guy Fawkes Day
