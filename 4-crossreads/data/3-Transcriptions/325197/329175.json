<p>Wed 13th Nov.<br/>Went to the London Opera House (Pictures) The people in great spirits over Peace.</p>
<p>After three o'clock no motor busses allowed along some of the main streets as they were so crowded. It was a common sight to see girls dancing to the music of a street organ, others again dancing on the roof of a taxi as it slowly moved along.</p>
<p>After a very exciting day I got back to the Hospital about midnight.</p>
