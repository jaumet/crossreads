There is a very fine church here with a square tower, & I am told, that to cover their retreat, the Germans mounted machine guns on this tower, & were so strong that is was necessary to burn them out. We had a good display of bursting shells yesterday evening, & bombing of airoplanes.

The night we arrived we had shells bursting
