was wounded so he had to carry on like myself act on his own.
We got all the wounded in I think the remainder of the Battalion rallied together in an old trench half full of mud, I had a great weight lifted off my mind when I heard that Len was safe it is simply marvellous how we live through it. I saw him once right down on the German parapet rallying his men bombs bullets were like hailstones
From here we made off back to our own trenches nearly 3 miles away for the attack had failed we were a sorry looking lot as we slowly ploughed our way through the mud now knee deep again after the heavy downpour I was about the last man of the C. Coy home for my leg was very painful I was absolutely done scarce move one leg after the other so done up was I, cold miserable don't mention it.
