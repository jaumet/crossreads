<p>My dear Judge,<br/>A letter from Dorothy written at Cooma on your return trip, came today. As always I was delighted to get it, &amp; to know that you were all well there, on 7/2/18 and that you had enjoyed the trip.</p>
<p>I have been doing a little "joy riding" too. I went up by car to Jerusalem about a fortnight ago, stayed there three days, then trekked on horseback to a spot some four miles this (w) side of Jericho, where I camped for another three or four days.</p>
<p>It was surprising to note the change in temperature on the road down. Of course Jerusalem is some 4000 ft above sea level &amp; Jericho is I think about 800 ft or more below. We started off with great coats on but by the time we reached Camp, about 2 p.m. we were perspiring freely without tunics.</p>
<p>The road is necessarily much the same as the one on this side of the hills &ndash; winding and zig zagging all the way. Jericho is nothing but a collection of some 20 or 30 buildings, some stone but mostly mud built &amp; all filthy. And the Jordan valley in that part is anything</p>
