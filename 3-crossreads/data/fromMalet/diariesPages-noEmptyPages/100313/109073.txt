26/1/18 London
Fine and warmer but dull. To the Bank via Underground and got out at Mansion House. Walked up past the Bank of England and then right up Threadneedle St. A solid mass of financial houses and banks ? not a pretension to beauty anywhere but solid wealth and stodginess. Seedy clerks wearing that emblem of respectability ? the top hat. Crowds of people running in and out of those places so like rabbit warrens. Passed through Gracechurch St. down round Old Jewry and other side streets. To Cheapside down to St Pauls and found a service going on there. Read a few letters and then went down Fleet St and the Strand to Charing Cross. Caught tube there and so back to the hotel and one more meatless day. I grow sick of eggs and fish. Cawthorne rang
