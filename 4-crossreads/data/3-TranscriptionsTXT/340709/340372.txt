 139 we were in an enemy's country miles from our base and there flew the glorious old banner of liberty. A European dressed in white awaited our landing. This proved to be Mr Stillen of the Sarang Plantations Ltd, Sydney. He is a German-Australian &amp; is the owner of the "Genoa" mentioned in an earlier page of this diary. Without actually telling him the object of our visit we asked the road to the creek. He readily guided us &amp; also took us along to his brother's house where I administered the oath of neutrality.

While conversing with Mr. Stillen on Thursday I learned that a steamer which might possibly be the one we are in search of had taken refuge
