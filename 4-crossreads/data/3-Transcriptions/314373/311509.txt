<p>where the different varieties are all displayed, spear the ones you fancy with a fork and then after paying for them at the desk you go and find a seat in the room or the garden outside when you are served with tea.<br/>Saturday 12/2/16. This afternoon Tad, Miers, Stewart, Shanks and myself all went to the Pyramids &ndash; The journey in was exciting enough for we had no sooner boarded the tram at the railway than we saw a corporal of the English troops killed by a tram. As this caused a block we decided to walk to Ezbekish Gardens and saw a soldier attacking a native, also two natives having a scrap, so that our journey was quite full of incident.

They are indeed fitting monuments to cover that great King who had such resources at his command, using 300,000 men three months every year during its construction, for carting the stone only, whilst the skilled workmen had permanent barracks there The reason why the men were used for three months only each year is that that three months was the period during which the Nile was in flood and they could not work. Miers and I climbed to the top, the others staying behind, and our energy was amply rewarded by the glorious view.
