  
 sick.  The doctor sent me to Hospital & after waiting about for six hours, find myself here in No. 26 Gen. Hosp. (English) & small chance of getting out.  Hospital of huts & large tents, very cold.  From here a fine view of the sea on one side & Paris Plage (favourite sea-side resort) on the other.  Straight to bed & feel too comfortable to believe it true, this bed is a change from sand. 
 Oct. 29th - Sunday Raining & high winds blowing but I am in bed until 1 p.m. & then get out.  No good to me lying in all day.  Not examined by doctor
