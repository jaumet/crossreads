The third brother is with a Royal Field Artillery as Med officer in France having a commission in the R.A.M.C. I saw him in London. He is a fine man. The same year as Capt Stuart Graham at P.A.H. Ursula Carter is very cheerful and sweet. Is temporarily attached to No 1 A.G.H. working at No 2 Aux where the men boarded for Australia are sent till transport is available. I sent you a p.c. of it - to Father I think. On Wednesday night Alma's Cousin took us to a concert given in aid of Y.M.C.A. by all who can do things to arrive amongst the Red Cross etc workers in Cairo. I saw lots of people I know there. Mrs Alex Hay - but I did not speak to her. Col Morgan Martin O.C. No 2 A.G.H. All men etc had special late pass granted and the Concert began very late nearly 10 pm, and was not over when we left at 12 a.m. All though the principal matron had not risen - I thought it was late enough. We had a lovely drive home in a car. There were two other boy friends of Alma's with us
