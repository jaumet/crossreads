<p>without opposition this morning.  A native was shot for cutting our phone wires at this post.  No trace of the enemy today &amp; he must be on the run.  Camped here during the night doing outpost.  We stayed at Sapirize till 4 a.m. on the 18th when we took over a post from the 4th regt. 5 miles ahead. At 3 p.m. we were ordered to Tagur (5 miles from Jaffa) doing outpost in pouring rain.</p>
<p>19:  Moved on to Mellebus (9 miles) with 3rd regt. on patrol &amp; outpost, keeping in touch with the retreating enemy.  Rained all day &amp; night &ndash; no bivvy sheets or waterproofs carried on this stunt.</p>
<p>20:  Enemy outposts sighted 3 miles distant.  People came in from for our protection, as officers (Turks) had been in demanding food &amp; wine &amp; creating a disturbance in the peoples houses.  Our patrols went out, but Abdul gave them a hot reception &amp; had to retire.  We had to keep in touch till the infantry came up &amp; remained here until relieved by 1st regt., our unit going to [indecipherable] for our rations &amp; fodder.  Received 17 letters.  Still pouring &amp; mud up to our horses knees, black soil &amp; sticks like glue.</p>
<p>21:  Stand to 3 a.m. I.C.C. taking over our sector, the Bde. returning to Ezdud at</p>
