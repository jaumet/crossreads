 Military Camp, Liverpool, N.S.W. 4th March 1915. 
 My dear Mother, 
 I am quite O.K. up here and the game suits me to a T.  Up at 5.30 in the morning, start drill at 6 o'clock till breakfast at about 7.45.  Drill again 9.15 to 12.15 and then Dinner till 2.15.  Drill again till 4.15, so you see they don't overwork us.  At half past five a.m. we get a cup of coffee (black &amp; thick) for breakfast we have Stew and same again for Dinner, for tea we have bread and jam and tea (nothing to drink for dinner). 
 Can't write too well as have two crook arms, one (left) from the Vaccination and the other from inoculation, which was done to-day. 
 Have a very sore throat to-night as I have been drilling squads since yesterday, and it makes you hoarse, I can tell you.  Am going up for an Exam for Sergeant very soon, but am very doubtful over result.  There are only 12 Non Commissioned Officers wanted and there are about 100 fellows going up for the positions and most of them have been here some time.  Anyhow, you never know your luck.  Of course you have to be an N.C.O. before you get a chance to go to the School for Instruction, but even if I don't get there, a Private's life is not too bad, it is not nearly so bad as I thought it would be. 
 If you care to come up on Sunday afternoon, I'll be here, but there is really nothing to see, though of course I'll be very pleased to see you. 
 I think that is all I can think of.  There is a terrible mob in this Tent singing Rags, and it is not easy to write.  There are dozens of fellows up here I know, so am O.K. 
 Any letters addressed to &ndash; Pvt R. Richards, "S" Coy. Inf Depot, Military Camp, Liverpool, will find me. 
 With love from Roy. 
 If you come up bring as many cakes as you can carry.  If you feed me, you have to feed the Tent (12 men)
