Passed Cape Otway about dinner time the country behind looks to be well wooded, but the foreshore is sandy colored, we skirted the Victorian coast all the afternoon heavy bushfires appeared to be raging along most of the coast, & a thick mist hung over all, shortly after tea we entered the heads, there has been much speculation as to whether we will go into quarantine or not
We will soon know now whats doing, the pilot has just come aboard & we are slowly going up the Bay, its too dark unfortunately to see anything save the glimmer of the lighthouses, the sunset tonight was a dinkum "Aussie" one bright red the first one of its kind for over 4 years, most of the lads are highly excited so far I have not gone or done
