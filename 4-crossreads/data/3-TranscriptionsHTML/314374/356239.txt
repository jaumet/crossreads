<p>(55)<br/>Hospital England</p>
<p>I spent four weeks in Abbeville Hospital and was then sent by train to Wimereux Hospital near Boulogne.  I had previously been in this Hospital after the Battle of Ypres.  Stayed here two days and on 18th April 1919 (Good Friday) I was carried on a stretcher by Herman prisoners to the Hospital ship "St Andrew" and crossed the Channel to Dover and then went by hospital train to Dartford where I was admitted to hospital there.  I had also previously been in this hospital.  Our names, battalions &amp;c were written up at the head of our beds.  The first morning I was there the sister in charge asked me if I came from Grafton and I said I did.  She was Sister Meares (whose father many years ago was C.P.S. at Grafton) and she knew my parents and several of the old Grafton residents.  I remained here a month in bed and was then able to get about on crutches.  Used to go into Dartford for walks and for many motor rides.  Once I was fortunate to be included in the Duchess of Westminster's motor party.</p>
<p>We had two never-to-be-forgotten visits from here to London.  On the first occasion thirty of us went to London by train and then took train to Windsor (twenty miles away).  On arrival at Windsor we were met by 'buses and taken to the Castle where we were received at the gates by the Keeper of the Castle and the guards in their quaint costumes.  Spent the whole day inspecting the castle.  The magnificence of it is beyond description.  Saw the bed the Kaiser slept in when he came over to London to attend King Edward VII's funeral, and many other interesting things.  One of the rooms contained all the curios and souvenirs that the present King brought back from Australia when he visited Australia as Duke of York in 1900 to open the first Commonwealth Parliament.  The stuffed kangaroos, boomerangs &amp;c made us think of home.</p>
<p>We had dinner in Queen Victoria's dining room.</p>
<p>Also saw through the wonderful St George's Chapel and the magnificent Mausoleum which contains the tombs of the Prince Consort and Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>Princess Alice (Countess of Athlone) received us and shook hands with us and also autographed our cards of admission to the Castle (which had the King's Crown on them and signed by the Lord Chamberlain &ndash; Sandhurst).  We returned to Dartford after a really splendid day.</p>
<p>The next occasion we visited London from here was to view the great Victory March through London of the Dominion troops on May 3rd 1919.  We went up by motor 'buses and had excellent seats to view the march in front of Buckingham Palace &ndash; only about fifty yards from the dias where the King, Queen, Prince of Wales and other members of the royal family were.  We were afterwards taken and given lunch, then to a theatre, and after tea motored back to hospital.</p>
