We tried a second shot with no result - but a third shot gave us a fine lot of blue tails - ?Mullet - Again the primitive man showed itself - China once again threw off his mask & was a first class sport - A second village on the shore emptied its male inhabitants into the sea & how they loved it - A catamarran turned over & this was the signal for shrieks of merriment - Well we had to get inboard & away for steam was ordered for 6 pm - We went up to Rabaul with a load of glorious fish - The green mountains towered around us & the cocoa palm plantations look resplendent - On the bow of our launch stood a naked black Adonis - broad shouldered - narrow hipped - black as coal with a flaming Zinnia red waist cloth - He formed a magnificent statue.
