  
 April 1917 morning, but it took him nearly all say inspecting the 7th & the Machine gun Squadron 
 Saturday 7th A & C Squadrons went out at 4 am & one troop of B Squadron followed later.  There was much aerial activity & anti guns were very busy nearly all day.  All the night on the 7th LH lines Chaplain Colonel Woods gave us an interesting lecture on Gaza & its history.  There was a big audience & they listened very eagerly to all he had to say. 
 Sunday 8th Had a quiet day in camp.  Church parade in the evening before tea. 
 Monday 9th The Squadron was up early & got away mounted with picks & shovels to Tel-el-Jemmi where we dug basins for the storage of 24,000 gallons of water We finished at 3.30 pm.  Whilst we were working 2 Turks came in unarmed & gave themselves up.  One was a sergeant & the other a corporal.  The 7th got a cavalryman but except for his sword & boots his equipment wasn't very good 
 Tuesday 10th The day was very warm.  The brigade moved out at 11.30 to go out on outpost before the Turkish post at Weli Sheikh Nuran
