  Dolly's Family Birthday  One of our majors went thro' the Turks lines to  Wadi El Arish  & found 4 good Wells- most useful & good work  Sent word back by Pigeons-  the message is written on thin rice paper & enclosed in a little aluminium box which is clamped on to the Pigeon's leg- This patrol did 40 miles over sand hummocks-   Moved on 4 miles closer to the Turks, we see them clearly every day- Your Parcels of Plum Puddings Fountain pen, milk & Mosquitoe net arrived in 2 parcels from England dated July 22nd - so many thanks  dear little Mother   I am writing this with the pen- just the things I wanted.
