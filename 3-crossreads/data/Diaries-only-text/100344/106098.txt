We were mucked messed about in the crowd for want of better clearer instructions. The trenches were new no one knew one place from another. So crowded was every sap, that one could not move let alone work, for being in anothers way. We found 18th Hqtrs in similar condition about 3 hours later could do nothing. However we were relieved of our job about 4pm. returned to gully to find good hot meal. 1st. feed for that day, a letter from K. Very short mystereous but sweet. Got our gear altogether and
