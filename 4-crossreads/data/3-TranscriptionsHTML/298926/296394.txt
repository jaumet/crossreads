<p>16-12-6<br/>"The Realism"  S Young</p>
<p>Its very well to talk about the glory of the war<br/>And read about the trenches in your books<br/>It kind of interests you, that's the picture or the sketch<br/>Or a photograph you say "How fine it looks"</p>
<p>But stay behind that picture there is much that lies concealed<br/>That escapes the passing glances of the few<br/>Who scan with idle interest just to while away the hour<br/>But say lads "What's it mean to me and you"</p>
<p>It does not show the tired minds that cry aloud for rest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And eyes droop protesting Nature's claim</p>
