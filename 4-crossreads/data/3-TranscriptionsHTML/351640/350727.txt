<p>[At the top of this and following pages of this letter is the word "Girls". Not transcribed.]</p>
<p>the Patons &amp; the Macdonalds agreed, especially as you had introduced them. My best wishes to both families. The weather during March in Bheath should be most pleasant.</p>
<p>I have had no letter from Dr. Harris of Wimereux recently, nor have I heard that the hospital is closed.  Next opportunity I shall ask some authority.  Sure that Joseph liked the blouse, you are such affectionate sisters to one another that you shed a halo of brightness and comfort all around.  From where did you derive it?</p>
<p>Must write to Mr. Frank congratulating him on Noel's pass, they will all be delighted.  Bert Norris &amp; Bessie Lane Mullins.  Good luck to them!  Only a few days since Father McAuliffe was wondering where the Papal Delegate would reside.  Rockleigh ought to suit him.  It is probable that the Australian Roman Heirarchy do not appreciate his coming, it appears that he has power to veto the acts of any of them and it may be of all.  Give Dot my love in return for hers.</p>
<p>Joe dear: Glad that you still think my letters to be "just lovely", it repays me well for writing them.  You are a tip top manager not to allow the Cohen matter to worry you.  The best way was the one you adopted.  He has always been a trouble.  I hope that you will get a tenant of some kind for the rooms, every little helps at the end of the week and month.  You will pull through quite rightly I am confident.  Keeping very well indeed.  From what has been incidentally dropped to my ears it may be that my stay with this hospital will not be for long, my change might be to a command of my own, which on the whole will give me improved status and a chance to perform better work, the slip shod methods thought sufficient here are not of the standard that pleases me.</p>
