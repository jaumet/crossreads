The boys soon got restless and made for the town where they imbibed too freely.  The "snake juice" got them properly and a lot of them came back fighting drunk.  Jim Copland and I went for a walk.

Some ladies arrived and issued us with cake, oranges and papers.  The Military Heads also issued us with a book dealing with repatriation matters and War Service Homes.  Our train left at 5 p.m.  There were several fights right away.  One wit in our compartment, who had been very friendly with the Military Police in England</p>
