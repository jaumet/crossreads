Camels on the Right of usCamels all around us- from Tawny Blacks to light fawns, this is the Camel Corps of enemy 1000s & our horses are more accustomed to them now.On the Desert, they blend into a perfect protective color & when lying down are hard to see on the march so much daylight shows under them they look all legs like a centipede.  Some are savage, but most of them were broken in.  At night their legs are tied like a sheeps & then on to a ring in the ground "Tiboui" or "Barley" straw or Maize is just put in a shallow basin hollowed out in the sand.
