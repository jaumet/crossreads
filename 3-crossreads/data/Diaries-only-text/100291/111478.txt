Jan. Tuesday 23 1917
Late on parade. Put on fatigues as punishment with  the unit. The coldest night on record. about 30 degrees of frost. Winter with a vengeance. All water etc is inches thick roads everything coated with ice. Many falls spills.
We move off at 10 a.m. after a couple of halts reach Albert billet in school house facing the ruined cathedral. The day is cloudless first of the winter, but consequently the air is the colder. Icicles hang on the men's moustaches. I never experienced anything like it. Get hot soup at Church Army Hut. Parade with sore feet, new boots. Back to billet fire.
