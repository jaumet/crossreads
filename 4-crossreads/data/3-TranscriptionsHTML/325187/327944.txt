<p>[Thursday 20 July 1916]</p>
<p>We are now watching each other, Brother Turk has entrenched &amp; we are pretty right too, several of our planes proceeded to well &amp; truly Bomb them this morning.<br/>Less sleep than ever now.   Cold better.  Posted notes yesterday as did not wish to run the risk of taking them to <u>Constantinople</u>.  We left a lot of Australian Papers in the Hods or Palms &amp; <strike>w</strike> I'm wondering what our Germs &amp; Turks think of Billy Hughes &amp; Co-  &amp; our recruiting- politics etc.  May have more interesting news shortly- I'm off to England this time if I get cracked.</p>
