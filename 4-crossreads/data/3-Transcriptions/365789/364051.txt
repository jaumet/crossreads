<p>Extract from letter from The Rev Edward Julien<br/>Chaplain First Batt.n<br/>AIF<br/>8/3/17.</p>
<p>"A few days ago I buried, according to the Sacred Rites of the Church of England Lieutenant F.S. Phillips, who was lying out for some time; being in no-man's land nothing could be done until the Hun's retreated.</p>
<p>Amid the shrieking of shells he has at last been laid to rest in the Bull's Rd Cemetery to the right of the town of Flers"</p>
