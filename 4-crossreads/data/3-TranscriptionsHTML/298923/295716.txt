<p>19 February 1918 Tuesday (X to X crossed out)<br/><strike>BETHLEHEM!!!</strike><br/>X Once more I'm here &amp; more time to let the wonder of our Saviour's birth be reconciled with the present strife of living X-   We watered our horses at Solomons Pool (These pools are the water supply for Jerusalem) near village of Khudr, where Greeks had built a Church &amp; in the distance could see the Minarets of Jerusalem.<br/>The Church is built among a village of mud Huts &amp; filthy surroundings, but has a beautiful Dome etc &amp; Clock tower which chimes the hours-   As we marched thro' Bethlehem some School children sang "Onward Christian Soldiers"<br/>I write from a peak 1723 ft <u>high</u> &amp; the Dead Sea is 1300 ft <u>below</u> only a few miles away.</p>
