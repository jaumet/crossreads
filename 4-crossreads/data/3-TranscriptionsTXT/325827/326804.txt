 France 13.6.16 R 5.8.16 Dear Father  &amp; all at Cairnleith 
 Since closing my general note I received another letter from you with all the news and also one taking me for a walk round the garden. 
 I am exceedingly glad about that new recognition of your long connection with the High School.  Three  such is not a bit too much under the circumstances. It is said that when a man marries a young lady he marries her family also. In this insurance it gives a great deal of pride to be connected with the family. When my engagement with Ol was first talked about I was astonished at Ol's identification &ndash; nearly always : Oh the daughter of Mr Waterhouse of the High School". I think it is lovely to quietly settle back and look back upon such a long record of work and influence and find it so lovingly recognised and I am sure it isn't one bit over descrts. I am glad of it all and proud too. Father you give me  "swelled head "over you. I have learned much from Cairnleith household and from  you personally and I suppose my experience is just along the lines of the Old Boys of the High School" Thanks for what you mean
