It is Sunday today one of the loveliest days imaginable, not a cloud in the sky a brilliant sun..
Took a stroll down to the Infantry Wing at Merckenghem this evening after tea to get my watch but he never had it done, for all the P.B. men have been ordered back to the Base at once he being one of these fortunates packed up and was gone so I have the watch still on my hands, but I never had the walk for nothing for while there I borrowed George Golders towel had a good hot bath it was bonza, took some of the camouflage off me properly I feel about 10 lbs lighter tonight after I had my bath 
3 of the chaps came for a stroll with me as far as our training ground it was lovely walking along the hedges
