Turkish Battery at 11 P.M. fired 10 rounds, it is not often they fire at night. terrible windy and dusty, no rain, a lot of traffic about here. They are again, shelling the beach. As I write this dozens of shot are going over. Taking it all into consideration the damage they do is comparatively small. A percussion shell is no good, except as a direct hit. I have seen men within inches of them, and not get hurt. They have been putting a lot of shell near our camp. This morning the first aid dressing station is being shelled, Expect to see the ambulance wagon blown to pieces. It is still there they put a shell through the tilt. The horse No 826 destroyed, on close examination was found to be in a shocking state, rotted right into the bone, When we were digging a hole to bury him, we were stopped by two officers, Had to drag him 1 &frac12; miles to bury him then<br/>25/7/1915<br/>Enemys aeroplane over dropped 1 bomb, our plane up after him, Another Battalion</p>
