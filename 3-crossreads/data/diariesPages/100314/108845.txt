men going to Boulogne. It is a bad place for canteen stores and Etaples would be much better. Attached to Brigade are two interpreters Mayes (French) and Albrecht (Belgium) both decent chaps and kept busy here. The people here and their youngsters are aimiable and sociable and never fail to pass the time of day in passing. Spent the evening in the Mess. Most staff work is done in the evening and between 8 and 10 pm. The telephones are kept busy between Division and Bde and out to the several battalions. On BdeH.Q. at present they have about 120 people mostly loafers ? dirty and undrilled. The tendency on these units is for them to get careless and become uncared for dirty in looks.
