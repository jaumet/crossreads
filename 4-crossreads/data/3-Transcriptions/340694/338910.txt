<p>25<br/>Received 4 parcels yesterday 2 from home &amp; 2 from Dorie. Received another from home to-day with plenty of lollies no rain to-day for a wonder the sun was quite warm.</p>
<p>10/7/16<br/>Had a very quiet day yesterday, after tea went for a spin to the Coy &amp; had a good yarn to the lads. About tea time a hostile Aeroplane was sighted right above us &amp; our guns opened fire &amp; the sky was a mass of bursting shells. We were afraid the bits would lob on us. A peice did drop over at the Coy quite close to one of the chaps. We have all been "under fire".</p>
