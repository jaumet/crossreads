When I did go into an uneasy doze, I was suddenly awakened by the feed bag being whisked out from under my head in a very summary fashion. I sat up amazed, wondering for the moment what had happened. Then I became aware of the form of a horse looming up in the blackness alongside of me. I recaptured my pillow, but he refused to budge, till I got up and chased him.
