  
 It was bad enough but it was worse this afternoon. We are on Picquet & had just drawn our tea when we were ordered to fall in. Of course we did not fall in imediately but still we husiled & then as usual stood about & were inspected 4 times. Now we have 11/2 hours to wait before going out. The Picquet amounted to walking about 1 mile & sitting down untill 9 oclock then home. Forgot to mention had 2 parcels a day or so back one packed by Am - & one by Fig  Tob & nurishment also a newspaper from Mother
