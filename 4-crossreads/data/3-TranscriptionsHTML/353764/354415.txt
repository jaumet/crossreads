<p>again as I explained before, the various Divisions will probably be sent to different places.<br/>There is something very big on as troops have been coming in &amp; going out all day &amp; night.  I think that this year will, in all probability see the end of the war, as the Germans &amp; Austrians are now becoming desperate &amp; the Turks are literally speaking on their last legs, &amp; don't forget, england still has about 1,000,000 fresh troops still concentrated here in Egypt, ready to be sent to any front.<br/>It is fairly cold here to-day with a bleak wind blowing</p>
<p>1.3.16 Wednesday<br/>To-day brought news that we have to shift Camp to a place called Luna Park.  But I do not think we go until Friday.<br/>Jack called &amp; said he thought they were to go to Tel-el-Kebir to-day, but I am awaiting further news from him.<br/>I &amp; a party of 5 Sergeants went into Cairo last night &amp; had a gay time.<br/> I was perched up on the Gahree [Gharrie] driving through Cairo, &amp; yelling out Ora-a-laigaley - Sha-me-nack - An-me-nack  etc, &amp; ran right into the Majors car, so I suppose I will hear something about it.  I drove them into every smelly &amp; dark looking spot</p>
