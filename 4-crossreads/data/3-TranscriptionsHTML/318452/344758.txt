<p>Our Batt, remained in the trenches till Sunday  morning when they were relieved. Hundreds of planes it seemed took part</p>
<p>Sunday Sept 23rd<br/>The Batt. came out about midday into Dikebush huts again.<br/>The first thing the soldier does after such a time is to wash, not having had his clothes off during the battle and to shave Around every little water hole could be seen scores of naked men enjoying a cold bath and on every stump &amp; tree little mirrors were stuck &amp; men were getting off the thick growth of beard &amp; then followed a good feed and a rest &amp; sleep. The men were very cheerful &amp; as I looked into the huts little groups were discussing the experience of the past few days</p>
