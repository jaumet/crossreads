 well back when our fight squadron are about . I saw one brought down a coupl of week ago . he came down like a meteor , but unlik one he left a Trail of black smoke across the sky . an air fight is rather excit but it not exact pleasant to watch a plane , come down in flame , or to see the wing shot off it even . it fall like a wound bird ? but it all in this game I suppos . I heard the other day that Jim Elder was back on this side , but so far have not had time to look him up . Eric I also heard had gone to a Machin Gun Coy . Sorri to hear that W. Selkirk has taken up arm again , and hope that he will not be abl to come across . I guess he wont like the place when he doe get here . When J. is over again will you pleas thank him for his letter and tell him I will write as soon as possibl , but cannot do so just at present , also thank Harri for his , will write him also when opportun occur .
