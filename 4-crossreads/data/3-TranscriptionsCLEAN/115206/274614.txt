MessinesSpent last night at l'aison with Mackenson a very decent fellow. I'm afraid he was not impressed with my manners. He heard me address an officer in 29th Battal as Jim. I remained in ignorance of "Jims" identity until closer observation revealed the fact that Jim was a major.Went to new O.P. with Gun as guide and brought back water.Pioneers planted a machine gun near our dugout. Precaution against hostile aircraft Weather wet.
