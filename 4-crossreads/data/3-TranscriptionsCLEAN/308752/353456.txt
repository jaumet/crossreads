23rd May 1917.Relieved at 9 a.m. reported back to M.D.S. & find the Ambulance all ready to move off. Which was very nice to know, believe me. Unit move all at 2 p.m. for that famous town again, arrived there about 4 p.m. & pitch our camp etc. We will be there for some time. For the next week we had a fairly easy time, gardening & a little drill. The bearers deserve a spell as the first 3 or 4 days was the severest we have experienced. Cricket in full swing again. On the 27th inst. Eric & I visited A------ & had a pleasant day.   On the 1st June, the training was a little more severe rout march with packs etc. Eight military medals awarded to the Unit, 7 being to B. Section, hard luck for A. & C. Sections who did equally as good work as the formers. Rumours about that very shortly the Unit will make another move & have a long trip before us.
