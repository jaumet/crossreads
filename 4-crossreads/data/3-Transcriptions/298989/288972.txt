<p>31/1/16<br/>Dug our trench today around keep, about a mile of it extended to four paces and got to work. No traverses yet merely scooped out the earth 3' x 3'. Revetment is by rush mats and expanded metal. Also improved fields of fire by chopping out bushes &amp;c.</p>
<p>After lunch rode round the outposts with the C.O. and put an extra picquet in. The outpost position commands the country in front and as far on the left as the 21st and on the right as far as a prominent hill called the Sphinx. An Indian patrol of two right out in the desert ahead and our aeroplanes out every day for purposes of reconnaissance so we ought to get timely warning of any enemy movement.</p>
<p>Tomorrow am riding back to Ismailia and may return after dark steering by stars and compass. Cables and other missions pouring in of course. Out in the desert we noticed the footprints of dogs and some have been seen &ndash; perhaps jackals. How does this dingo exist? Ants and earth worms also seem to live there too. No birds of any sort. The sand assumes some peculiar shapes. One hill some miles off has seeming embankments all along the top just like trenches while Hogs Back is just an enormous smooth mass of loose sand. The sight of all "C" Coy rolling and toboganning down this was very amusing.</p>
