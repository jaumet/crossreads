<p>Whizz bang shells going near dump all evening and a lot too close for comfort.  One burst right under their Sergeant who got across paddock very quickly afterwards although he said he was used to shell fire.  I smiled.  I was glad to get rid of them.  We weren't allowed to go home and had to work on till 1.30 when we finished.  Bed very tired.  Cloudy.</p>
<p>28.4.18<br/>Stayed in bed all day and at 6 reported to Avery with Anderson, Burnop, Burns, Toogood, Robertson and Boot for making dugouts for No. 3 by our cookhouse who were shelled out of the farm.  Extremely heavy barrage on left.  Raining a good deal but I didn't work and knocked off at 11 and went to bed tired.  Wirers not home till 3 at which time Fritz started an area bombardment by howitzers and continued on.</p>
<p>29.4.18<br/>Barrage on left going heavy all the time till 3 <strike>next</strike> to-day and heavy shells falling thickly all round us and very close.  Storr and Carter's dugout blown in but they weren't hurt although had a rough time twice afterwards as well.  All a good bit shaken and couldn't sleep much.  Enemy aeroplanes over many times during morning and things pretty rough.  Hardly any damage done although the place churned up everywhere.</p>
