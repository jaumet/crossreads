 Buysscheure, St Momelin, Serques, Nort Leulinghem 23/10/16 The small commune of Buysscheure is the boundary between Flanders and France and the Flemish language is spoken as far south as St Omer.  Excellent billets here which we were loath to leave.  We passed our own  battalion starting point at 10 a.m. and made for the Brigade point which we passed at 11am.  The Battalion was leading an extremely long column which stretched for a mile or two!  The country was again very pleasant and we pulled up for lunch from 12 to 1.30 the General joining us in a snack.  We have taken a most roundabout course today and are further away from St Omer tonight than we were yesterday.  As the whole Division is in billets close round, this roundabout method is necessary.  Passing the through the extremely dirty little hamlet of St. Momelin where we saw some filthy little children we came to a canal on the bank of which we marched about 4 kilometres.  Noticed the pointed sampan like boats the farmers use &amp; winding road through delightful sylvan glades took us through the dearest little villages nestling with the thatched roofs round their stone church.  Eventually struck the Route National a grand road of metal and straight as a die.. The men sore footed and tired but some of them always vociferous and chippy.  Remarked during a halt how careless we are of the conventions.  Men at once squat down on latrines dug right out in the open and ease themselves in full view of passers by.  No attempt is made to avail ourselves of the privacy afforded by hedge or bush.  The women are not spooked  - they take no notice.
