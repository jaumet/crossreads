<p>sleep again, when a fellow named <u>Bretherton</u> next [indecipherable] went clean mad &amp; took a fit, nearly everybody got for their naturals away from him, by main force we got him down to the Hospital, now find it is a case of cold feet &ndash; he has worked himself up to this.</p>
<p>8/5/16  Monday</p>
<p>Very hot &ndash; Drilling from 6.15 am to 10.15, then had a swim. None of the Boys like the new regulations as we often have to be on Parade, full marching order at 5.30 am on a very slender Breakfast.</p>
<p>The 29th Brigade left at daylight for the trenches, some of us fellows will have to go out as Ambulance to them. Brought in a fellow out of the Division with 3 toes chopped off accidentally with an axe.</p>
<p>While down at the Canal saw 2 Large Passenger Boats going thro, &ndash;  one was an American &amp; on the side she had painted the full width U.S.A. we all threw off &amp; asked if she was carrying another note. They both had a lot of women passengers on &amp; we were in all sorts of dress &amp; undress, it was quite refreshing to see some of our white girls &amp; children, there must have been some Australians on board as they gave us a <u>Cooee</u> &amp; needless to say they got a good one in return.</p>
