  
 Some demonstration at 3.30 by our front as a general attack was taking place on left flank in day light Heavy firing on left all noon & night. The bombing by our men on Quinns seemed specially good. Absence of machine gun fire noticeable. 29th Div I believe it is have landed on left also 5th Aust reinforcements. 
 Sun 22 Before breakfast did Walkers saps & firing line Courtneys & main sap. Former of last two very unsanitary. 
 Snipers had two goes at me early. One close. I am pleased with notice re saps
