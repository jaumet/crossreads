<p>January 1916<br/>march to Helouan across the desert &amp; several parades in full marching order, so that we can pack up &amp; get ready to march out quickly  I went to the races on the 22nd &amp; spent a good afternoon winning a few shillings after paying expenses.   I met Henry Newing there &amp; arranged to meet him on Monday.  On Sunday I remained in camp &amp; wrote some letters.  I have received letters from Frank, Violet Blair &amp; from Aunt Carrie &amp; replied to all.  On Monday I went into town &amp; got my pay book fixed up, making a new allotment of 5/1 drawing the remaining 3/5 here.</p>
<p>I called on Newing at Ordnance &amp; had dinner with him &amp; he gave me a good new military riding overcoat.  I also called at the Vacuum Oil Co &amp; had a yarn with some of the heads.  They said they were pleased to see me &amp; asked me to call again.  There has been a fair bit of rain lately &amp; more has fallen this year than for years previously.  I had tea at York House</p>
