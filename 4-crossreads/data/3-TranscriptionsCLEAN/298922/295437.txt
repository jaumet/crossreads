 ABASAN KEBIR 
 Still in the front line very tired but going strong - have not had a wash for a week. Still all in the game. Our men are always at their best when the pinch comes - but these pinches make a man old & reduce his Tummy some. Off again at dark on a counter march of 12 miles - like a game of Chess, interesting if not so damnable sleepy. The whole landscape rises & falls in front of a man, he sleeps on his horse odd moments. Still this is soldiering.
