<p>Dear Father<br/>This is just a hurried note to give you the information I have recieved re Bert. I have heard from Sister Edwards (V.A.D.) nurse) She is a daughter of the Mr Harrison I told you of. I am sending her letter across to you in a seperate envelope. So you can see just what is being done. Bert has evidently been well provided for up to the presint &amp; I daresay shall always fare as well as any of the others. But a few shillings a month pocket money wouldint be amiss to him. You will see in the letter I am sending I have been offered money to make arrangements straight away. But didint think it necessary to do that. I may get bowled over very shortly &amp; wouldent like to think I had borrowed money &amp; not paid it back before going out. I believe I am to be sent back to France again at an early date.before Xmas as far as I can hear.So shall be facing Fritz again before your receive this letter. Oh well I have had a very good time across here &amp;</p>
