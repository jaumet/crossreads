Sunday 11 July 1915

Rose at 4.30 a.m. The stars shone white & as dawn broke across placid surface of the ocean, I felt a new self arise in me – the morning was so peaceful & majestic, the sun as it rose through threw a golden glory over the distant horizon, & finally appeared in a great white disc in all its glittering heat. A ragged edge of clouds, low down, turned like red hot coals, & the sea between the ship & the distant flaming orb became a molten mass, magnificent in its grandeur & at which the eye could gaze but for a glimpse second, so powerful was the sheen. A new self – yes, like dead scales the superficialities, the falsities, the habits of life of the world I have left behind seemed for the instant, whilst I gazed upon that awe-inspiring scene, to drop from me. Romance & a keen observation of beauteous nature engendered & fostered in me from that moment a feeling of love for all things beautiful & serene, and I offered a silent prayer to heaven that I was alive to appreciate the significance of the mighty splendour of that glorious sunrise.
