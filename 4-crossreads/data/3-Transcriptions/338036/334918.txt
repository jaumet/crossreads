<p>[22nd June contd]<br/>all over my bed.  At night to Pictures closeby &amp; saw Charlie the Tramp.  It revived a pleasant memory.  Received some more Ossy mail.</p>
<p><strike>Friday 22</strike> Saturday 23rd<br/> Quite an exciting day.  Nearing midday Fritz commenced to shell the balloon nearest our Camp but without success.  Half an hour later a fleet of enemy aeroplanes came from the clouds and set fire to the balloon after the observers had quitted in parachutes.  Immediately our Archies opened fire and there was some fun for a long time.  Then the Fritzs set out for two more of our balloons towards Ypres and after a tussle fired them both and made off.  It is said we brought one of them down.  An hour later two more balloons were up.</p>
<p>The Archies however had their revenge at tea time &amp; brought  <strike>the first pl</strike> a Fritz plane down in the act of firing another balloon.  I saw the whole incident &ndash; the plane being squarely hit when very close to balloon.  After tea we went across &amp; obtained a piece as souvenirs.  It was the first I have see brought down by aircraft guns.  On my return to M.D.S. I was detailed for Orderly Room work tonight.</p>
