<p>and Easter Sunday but am afraid there will be no opportunity of seeing Edie.</p>
<p>Edie asked me to visit her cousin Ronald who was an inmate at Reading Military Hospital.  I called but he had been dismissed from the hospital just 2 days before.</p>
<p>With Kindest regards to you all &ndash; hope all are well</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>&ndash; Edmund &ndash;</p>
