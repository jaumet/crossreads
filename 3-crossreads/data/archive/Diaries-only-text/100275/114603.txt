be returning, with their guns so I expect we will be back any day now
This day 2 years ago England declared war on Germany, how it has dragged along since then I wonder when it will all end, but there is no doubt about who has the upper hand now, Germany won the first 18 months of the dust-up, but what does it matter if we lose 49 battles win the 50th last, that is the one that counts, the one which England always wins, so it will be this time again Germany is undoubtedly getting weaker weaker, while we are there is no doubt about it getting stronger stronger
