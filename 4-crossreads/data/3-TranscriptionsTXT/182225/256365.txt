SEPT.   SUNDAY 3   1916
Cold & bleak all day. Had a morning's writing in the hut and wrote & read in afternoon & went for a walk round with Bill & Warren & Armstrong in evening. Had a lot of surprises first I got put under open arrest by QMS Lark for not having my blankets rolled but he did not carry on with the case, then I got a parcel from Linda with an Anzac Book and pair of socks then Warick Gregory and old Poss Nivison came over in afternoon & we had a great yarn about old times.
