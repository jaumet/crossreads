In all our loyal Australian FleetEach man lets his thoughts drift home,To think of those that love him,Though he is crossing the oceans foam.
To fight for his mother CountryOn a distant foreign shore,But homely ties are closer boundWhen loved ones go to war.
When this grand war is overAnd we are homeward boundThe loving welcome that awaitsWill be our greatest glory crowned.
