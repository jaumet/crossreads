There is a beauty blowing today. Everything is covered with dust and it is impossible to see for more than about 100 yards. There is nothing given out yet as regards our future movements but we are under orders to move out at any time. The general impression seems that we are to go to the Bosphorus but I don't think anyone really knows. Personally, I am not at all particular but I would very much like to see some fighting in Germany if we are to see it at all, before it is all over. I met Mrs Rabett (Sen) last night. She and her daughter are going on to England tomorrow week. Quite a lot of Australians & English people out here now. I expect from now on all our correspondence (3)
