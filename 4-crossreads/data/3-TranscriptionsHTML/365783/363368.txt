<p><u>Copy to Mother</u><br/>No. 2 General Hospital<br/>Mena Camp<br/>Cairo<br/>28.1.15.<br/>My dearest old Mrs.<br/>My last letter was from Alexandria dated 17th Jany.   On the [blank] I left Alexandria in charge of an advance party of our unit with instructions to proceed to Mena &amp; pitch our hospital.   I had with me 5 officers &amp; 50 men.   The train journey between Alexandria &amp; Cairo was very interesting &ndash; we traversed the Nile Delta for 3 &frac12; hours &amp; it is just like a succession of Chinamen's gardens.   Every inch of the land is irrigated &amp; under cultivation.   We passed numerous Arab villages &ndash; these are really a conglomeration of mud huts housing human beings, camels, donkeys, sheep, goats &amp; dogs.   From Cairo we proceeded by tram to Mena distant about 10 miles.   Here we are camped under the shadow of the Great Pyramid &amp; close to the large Mena House, in times of peace a fashionable hotel and the resort of the society of Europe &amp; of America.   The advance party was joined after a couple of days by the rest of our unit &ndash; in the meantime we made a start in getting the tents pitched.   I have since been in charge of the camp &amp; am entrusted with the task of getting the whole camp in order.   Mena House has been used as a hospital for the more serious cases</p>
