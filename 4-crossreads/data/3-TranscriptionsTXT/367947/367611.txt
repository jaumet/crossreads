 I am going to a Cavalry School for a course on Monday. Its quite a new thing &amp; at present only meant for senior officers. I feel quite favored at being sent along &amp; you can bet I'm a trier. Will let you know how I get on. Its' at Cairo. 
 We are still miles out in the desert so of course it will be quite a good change too. The square head is getting it hot now. Next summer will see it all over. The smaller fry will peter out &amp; then we'll get the Kaiser's push. Its just a case of time tells only the push hurts the longer it goes. Jacko has left this country pretty well but he'll still be a nuisance for some time. They'll all go though before this time next year. 
 Well old boss more in a week or so. I may cable or I may post the fiver. Hope it comes in time for Xmas. 
 Fondest love to you &amp; Clare &amp; the kidlets &amp; all the tribes. Will see you after the war alright. Tooraloo 
 Yours ever lovingly Bill 
 Got a letter from T.A.N.K. in France. He's alright.
