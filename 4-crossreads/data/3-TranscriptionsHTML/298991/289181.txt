<p>Tuesday June 19th<br/>This camp will do me, they have a fairly decent lot of Officers &amp; N.C.O's here now. Went up for reclassification this morning &amp; was marked B1 A, so that means I will be here for a while yet, of course I had to put in a few "good ones" to get as low as that. We get very good food here. The chaps who have been here for a while says there was a riot over the food about three weeks ago, &amp; from that day things have altered considerably. Went for a bit of a route march &amp; lecture this afternoon. They do not so much drill here, &amp; then it is all stretcher drill.</p>
<p>I have met a good few fellows I know, including some who were here this time last year. Some of the "staff" are still here, perhaps they may find out some day there is actually a war on. Went to a concert in the Church of England this evening. It was a London troupe &amp; not up to much, of course some of the items were good &amp; <u>some</u> very crook, nerve racking to Listen to.</p>
<p>Wednesday June 20th<br/>A big draft picked to go to France today, there are only about 30 "neutrals" left now. We have to take our blankets out <strike>every</strike> on early morning parade every morning to air them, &amp; a very good idea too! Had a tooth filled this afternoon &amp; it aching "<u>some</u>" now, of course it was filled in military style. Very windy all day. Rained this evening. We have a very good &amp; sociable mob in our hut.</p>
