 best way we could . The rum had made new men of us and we got quit cheer and had some bread and jam . befor turn in to sleep. The floor was wet and muddi so we spread a piec of roof felt on the floor and Billsi Snowi and I turn in togeth . We had to sleep in our wet cloth . Thursday 26th The last few day have been one vast period of carri patient through the mud . Pull each other out of shell hole , and search for somewher to sleep. This is about 12 mid day and up to now we have n't had a decent feed or a sleep and everybodi is dead beat . So mani excit incid have happen that it is veri difficult to think of them all . About 4 a.m. on Wed . we had just return from our 8 hour duti ( with a 2 hour walk either way ) and we were live up await our Rum issu when a shell burst about 20 yds . away and smother us all in mud . Someth struck me veri hard in the chest and I thought I was hit , I felt there and found it wet , I thought it was blood but on go to the light discov it mud and not a " Blighti " the shell fire is terrif and never ceas night or day . It is murder carri patient at night it is pitch dark and at time onli for the flash from gun and star shell we should get bush or bog in the mud . The time for chang shift are get alter and the 15th are reliev the 14th at 4 instead of 8 we met them on the way out . After get our rum Snowi Billsi and I crawl into what we thought was a 15th dugout . No sooner had we settl down than 2 of the 14th return , so of cours we had to clear out and make room for them . It was drizzl with rain and our boot and pant were full of water and were mighti cold to put on . We crawl over to the cookhous and lay down there all among the greasi dish . On our way over we drop our blanket in the mud and lost one , and it was ici cold . No sooner had we laid down than a whizz-bang came over and smother us with mud , it was about 5 a.m. by now and we just got over this shock when the cook came and turn us out so we finish our night rest in the cook dug out . We had to turn out again about 7.30 for Break . It is love ? Turn out these cold morn and put on wet muddi boot and pant with mud up to the crutch . A drink of hot tea put great head into a man . We were to be on duti from 12 a.m. till 6 p.m. There , and as it was a 2 hour scrambl through mud and shell hole to get to our post we had to fall in at 9.30 to draw ration and we left the A.D.S. about 10 . It is a good dugout at North Road , the same post we were at on Sunday . There were 16 men at each post .
