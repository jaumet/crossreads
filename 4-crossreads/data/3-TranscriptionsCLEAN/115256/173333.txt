  
 Monday 15 March 1915 
 Left camp early after breakfast this morning to practice extended order work.  The Colonel, as usual, was not on parade and the brunt of the control of the battalion thus fell on our fool overworked second-in-command.  All morning and for the greater part of the afternoon, we extended, closed in again, changed direction, and the usual run of this sort of work.  It all means running about like a lot of sheep, and, in the heavy sand, this is no easy job.  However, we started for camp early in the afternoon and, on the way home, the wonder of wonders happened!  It actually  rained .  Rain in Egypt?  Almost inconcievable!  We had almost forgotten what rain looked like and we took advantage of the reminder.  Hats were off, jackets unbuttoned to make the best of the few points that did fall.  I am waiting to see the morning paper to-morrow.  War news will be right in the background, I imagine, and, in big headlines, will appear:  "Terrific rainstorm in and around Cairo.  Nearly ten points registered."  It makes one think what wonders old Nature works.  To make up for the absence of rain, he makes arrangements for the Nile to overflow at regular intervals.  Hence a great deal of fertility and cultivation wherever there is irrigation.  Poor old Egypt if it had to depend on its tremendous yearly rainfall!
