<p>Sunday 9 April 1916<br/>Went to Church in Cairo this morning.  Left for Salhia or Zazazar at 2-40 p.m.  The Services in the morning are very poorly attended in Cairo, a few Civilians sprinkled among the mixed Soldiers principally Tommies.  Rev. Stirling from England is by far the Best speaker here, &amp;amp; His addresses are excellent. The building used by the Methodists is opposite Davies Bryan the large English General Merchants.  The place is very comfortably fitted up &amp;amp; would accomadate at least 250 people.</p>
<p>Monday 10 April 1916<br/>Carting officers Mess Stuff from Station which arrived by 9-40 a.m. train.<br/>Col. Fuller went early to Tel-el-Kebir to see about 'details'.<br/>These 'Details' are men under Capt. Caine, who were recently at Maadi, but have now come nearer to the Regiments.<br/>A large number have been drafted into newly formed Artillary Camps &amp;amp; will soon occupy our old Camp at Serapeum.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11 April 1916<br/>Regiments on parade.<br/>Div. H.Q. with Horses &amp;amp; Equipment arrived from Serapeum by train under General Chavel.<br/>This lot came by a newly erected Line via Cantara.  Only the military are allowed to use this line, &amp;amp; then only in exceptional cases.<br/>There is plenty of scope about here for any number of Troops &amp;amp; Rumour says the Mounted Div. will mobilize here, &amp;amp; prepare for the Front.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12 April 1916<br/>Very heavy wind Blowing, no parade.  Sand Storms here are bad for both man &amp;amp; Beast.  Sand Flies are also bad, &amp;amp; the Horses suffer much from bites.  Rumours came that Sheds are to be erected for Horses <strike>&amp;amp; Mess Shed for</strike> but little notice is taken, as our previous Camp at Serapeum was to be made the most comfortable spot for both man &amp;amp; Beast.  Needless to say it was not done.</p>
