  
 the fact that he is to let one know at once any way in which I can help him and hope we shall often see one another.  He was a very fleeting bird of passage today but I managed to snare him for a few minutes, took him down to the mess & talked while we had a hasty lunch.  Luckily a letter from Dorothy arrived this morning a few minutes only before he did, so that I could give him the latest information about you all.  He had seen numerous of our mutual friends in England but we haven't had a real talk yet. 
 Excuse this very hurried note, but it is written to catch a mail leaving earlier than was expected. 
 With love from Yours very affectionately Walter
