July 1917
8th - 11th  Moascar. Gave Capt Logan book to take to Molly. He was to leave today (11th) by Port Sydney. Made formal appln for leave 13th to 17th. Rumours isolation to be lifted Saty 14th. Sgts mess formed. Bairnsgrove & Duncan of A.M.C. details also there. Overseas L Hsmn [Light Horsemen] arrived & some went straight thro. Enquired if Scott there? About four inspectns in three days.  Generals plentiful.
11th-17th  Camp routine as usual nothing startling. ICC left on 16th for Abbassia. C.B.F.A. still standing fast. Supposed to be going to Cairo, fancy we will end up at Ferry's Post. On 15th 50% granted leave & about 80% of them returned home under arrest. General mess up. No apology to the men. Applied for leave 13/17th told to renew appln. Wait to see how events pan out first.
