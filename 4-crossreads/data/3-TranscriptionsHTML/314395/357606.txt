<p>the pipe you sent me last Xmas and so far have heard no rude remarks passed, as to its aroma.</p>
<p>No <strike>mail</strike> news from you or Kitty this mail, I think that a good many letters get lost coming back from the Unit.  I am in an infantry battalion at present doing their drill, till I go to the Art. details Camp which I hope will be soon.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br/>Your affect. Son,<br/>George</p>
