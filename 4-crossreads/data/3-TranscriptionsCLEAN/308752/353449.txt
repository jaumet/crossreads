patients to the next Post,  all the way along, Fritz was putting all kinds of stuff all around us, but of course we are in the lucky 8th. The day was beautifully fine & this time NO MUD  it was quite a relief.  News to hand of two of our bearers being wounded, Lind Palmer (who photo you have) & Dick Sholer but not serious I believe.About 11 a.m. a rush of patients occurred,  it was hard & strenuous wok especially as we were short handed.

It is absolutely marvellous that none of the bearers were hit & we all thank God for our safety. The perspiration poured out of me, it was a trying ordeal. Almost every time each squad returned from a carry we found more patients
