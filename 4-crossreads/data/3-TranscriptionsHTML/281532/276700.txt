<p>21/9/18 Cappy</p>
<p>This Saturday morning is blowy and lowering. Last night the crispness of the air was verging on frost &ndash; summer has left us. Great scheming and wondering is going on about the 21st &ndash; probably all of no avail. Everyone feels very sorry for them. Poor Leon Barbier came down yesterday in a terrible state searching a new home. This morning the 21st held a mass meeting and deputations of officers and men waited on the General in the hope of avoiding being broken up. We carried on with providing more accommodation. I went to 6th Field Ambulance and had afternoon tea with Colonel Welch and Simmonds. After that returned. The evening calm and moonlit. Rambled to Bde &amp; 21st and saw Reed.</p>
