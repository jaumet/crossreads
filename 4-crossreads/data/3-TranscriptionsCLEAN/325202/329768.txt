horses with us but had handed over our waggons to one of the new Divisions in Cairo as we were to get British Pattern Waggons in France.
On Mar 25/16 we went on board the S.S. Manitou; It used to be a heavy task embarking & entraining the horses but now they are all veterans and walk into railway trucks or up ship's gangways and along the horse decks as part of a regular routine.
We pulled out from the wharf at about 5 p.m. and anchored out stream for the night. Our ship load consisted of the 1st Aust. Div. Train about 500 men & 700 horses and a Brigade of Howitzer Artillery another 500 men.
I couldn't help noticing the difference in leaving the quayside this
