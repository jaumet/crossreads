  
 Sunday 21 May 1916 Voluntary Church parade at 7.45 a.m.  Col. Fuller inspecting Camp. 6th & 7th Reg. went for Swim in Ocean. Enemy's Air-o-plane dropped Bombs on Pt. Said this morning early. An alarm came to camp at 3-30 a.m. that a Taube was overhead.  Men stood to their Horses. Went for swim with Ted this afternoon it was lovely.  The beach is wide & long, & for a Bathing spot it is perfection. Word received that 6th & 7th Regiments have to go on a long trip tomorrow for 3 days. 3 letters from Home. 
 Monday 22 May 1916 Left for Bir el Ab at 8 a.m. today with 6th & 7th Reg. & Brigade H.Q.  Arrived Katia 10 a.m. & camped there till 8 p.m., when we left again for Ogritina.  Stayed for 2 Hours resting & again continued our journey at midnight.  The suppies  followed us on Camel, & the 2nd L.H. F. Amb. with Sand Carts accompanied the Column.  The Col. & Major Bruxner dug up a supposed Turkish grave & found instead of Bones Cases of Turkish Ammunition.  All Humpies & Guynas  were knocked down & Burnt.  The Horses were watered & fed before leaving on the night march. The N.Z. supported us on our right. 
 Tuesday 23 May 1916 Major White returned from Cairo. General Chavel & party in Camp. We arrived at Bir-el-Ab at daybreak 3-35 a.m. the 7th Leading.  A number of Turks & Camels were watering at the well, & on the approach of the 7th Reg. made off, ony one Turk & Camel were captured.  The general opinion is that some one made a hash of the Show, & that not only all the Enemy & Animals ought to have been taken, but the Brigade should have launched out & had a 'go' at a number of Turks who had congregated about 3 miles to the North:  nothing was done however, & the Troops returned to  Romani  about 5 p.m. after practicalally doing no good.  Unless fresh Blood is infused instead this Brigade I think we will hardly earn our Salt from a fighting point of view.  The men are willing, but can do nothing without orders. 
 Wednesday 24 May 1916 General Chavel & party proceeded to the Coast to inspect Canal that has been dug there.  They took a number of men with Shovels to further open up the drain. The majority of men & Horses are resting to-day. Capt. Stracker gave us some fresh Goat. Rumour is that a large number of Aus. in France have been cut up including 130 Officers. The New Zealanders sent out a partrol a few Days since, & they narrowly escaped being captured by a party of Turks who suddenly appeared, & captured some equipment & killed a Horse.  This happened outside Orgritina.
