<p>&amp; have had to write about a dozen letters &amp; have two envelopes left &amp; I have to answer Lols yet. I left hers &amp; yours till last as if I had not written to the others first I might have fibbed on it. Well dear old Sis there is no more news I can tell you so will conclude with fond love to you Noni &amp; Vol from your loving brother Hal</p>
