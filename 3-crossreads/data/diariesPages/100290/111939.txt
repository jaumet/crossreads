longe Munition factories, Sea, Napoleons monument tall lighthouselooking structure nearest to England. St. Mor. ruined Cathedral. Hazelbrouk. Steenwaurk disentrian. Leave kitbags. Trek thro? town halt for refreshments. Then thro? peaceful country lanes. Crops growing luxuriantly, peas, beans, everything lovely. Sound of guns in firing line only indication of war. The pity of it.
Arrived Sailly, destination at 1p.m. 3 miles behind trenches. raining as usual, mud, quiet soldiers, coming going to trenches. Gas helmets, universal. Sailly captured by 
Germans in 1914. Cathedral ruined burst, houses wrecked fruits pitted with rifle fire. Put into barracks at 6 p.m. tea in shop. To bed thoroughly tired out.
