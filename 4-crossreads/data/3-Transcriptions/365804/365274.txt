<p>Rollestone<br/>20.9.16</p>
<p>My dear old mater,<br/>Excuse this scrawl, but it is as cold as the deuce and my fingers wont work. By rights I should be on parade now, but I heard there was a mail leaving today, so came in to try and catch it. I don't think therI is anything to say that I haven't already said, so I'll say it again in case I've missed something out.</p>
<p>When the cyclists disbanded, the officers were give a chance of saying where they wished to go. The men, of course, were pushed where it was easiest for the authorities to put them. Mont went to the first Batt. Reinforcements camped at Perham  Downs, Brissenden had already been transferred to 3rd Div. headquarters, and Duffy and I came into the 20th.</p>
<p>Jack, I think will try for a further transfer</p>
