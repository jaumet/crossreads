"The Carthage"the neighbourhood of the French lines but we could not tell what it was. At 2 o'clock whilst sitting down to dinner we felt & heard an explosion & passed a joke concerning it, but on looking out of the Port Hole I saw four Destroyers steaming rapidly away from the Battleship & on looking in this direction I was amazed to see a large French Transport * heeling over at the stern. She had been torpedoed & was rapidly sinking. It was an extraordinary sight. The stern disappeared first, the bows pointing up into the air straight up & then gradually disappeared leaving nothing but a swirl of water with debris & a few bodies. Trawlers etc hurried to the rescue & Destroyers began to circle round looking for the submarine. Our ship, an armed Patrol boat also took up the search & our Gun & crew sighted something near where the French Battleship had been & instantly fired several rounds at it. I was standing close by & the noise was deafening although only a 12 pounder. There was quite a panic on board, nearly everyone thinking we had been hit & they rushed up on deck tying on lifebelts etc. One Ghurka died shortly after. I fancy the fright helped him along. We steamed over where she sank. A very serious moment
