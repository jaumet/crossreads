 This a word for word copy.  As soon as I've the while I'm going through Mac's file of Patrol and Brigade reports.  Knight would be in one of the Btns. of the 3rd Brigade. 
 June 2 177. When Ted was expecting early this morning this was to be his 'issued' day, Tom coming in after breakfast turned me out!  So a pass for Borre, and a setting out at 9, a day to La Kreule and to Borre, and back to La Kreule for Tea with Harold N. and Toby, so back to D.H.Q. 
 Last night out for a walk with Ken, we passed an estaminet full of hilarious and fraternising Australian services and French:  Ken doesn't drink, so tonight back towards the same place early, only to find the shutters up and the dull notice tacked to the door, "No Beer till tomorrow"!  So back to St. Sylvestre Cappel to the swimming pool, and to the hut. 
 Called at the Pioneer Transport lines, but Vin away with another section. 
 Mail at La Kreule only the Anzac Bulletin and a letter from Jake.  Jake in hosp. somewhere in France, three woundings in the thigh:  a note of two pages with a promise of more detailing when he gets to Blighty. 
 B. Sect. Bearers at Borre, and they with A. Bearers from La Kreule going in tonight to bear for the stunt, 300 casualties are expected. 
 From Willie a photograph of Wilk and himself, long promised since R'Avelsberg [Ravelsberg. 
 Today through the A. Div. two of our bearers, new men who I'd only casually known. 
 Brought back the two books, "Building Constructions" and English Cathedrals, & a P.C. from Smiths of Paris notes their sending to England for James Joyce's "Exiles". 
 Tells the word in of the Boche advancing on the Marne! but at La Kreule all the interest is centered on the scandal case being tried in England.  Toby adds a name, to the 47,000, Billy Hughes! 
 Post tonight letter to Mother.
