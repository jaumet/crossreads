  
 Sun. 26th May (cont.) Later we dropped into a Franco-Russian concert in the theatre. 
 The theatre itself is similar to the one at Karlsruhe, albeit dirtier, but the stage is very well equipped.   The orchestra is splendid, but the performance during our visit was a Russian farce, dreary and apparently full of repetitions.   The place was packed with, and reeked of, Russians & we were absolutely obliged to leave after a few moments.   Two maids from the Graf's house were present. 
 Graf von Bradow is the commandant of the camp, an elderly, bearded man who leaves everything to his unteroffiziere. 
 Tue. 28th. 3 parcels arrived for me today.  Wild excitement in the Mess.  Two of bread & one general from Kopenhagen.
