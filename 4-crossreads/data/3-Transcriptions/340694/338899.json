<p>14<br/>28/5/16.<br/>Was kept going yesterday with request for Transport owing to the withdrawal of Battalion 1st line transport. Was awakened early this morning on the same duty. They don't care about it being Sunday, one forgets the days of the week here.</p>
<p>30/5/16<br/>Everything has been a bustle &amp; is still so. Troops are beginning to move out so our wagons are kept at it. Parties of troops are continually marching past with kit bags &amp; blankets to have them disinfected. Everywhere is excitement.</p>
