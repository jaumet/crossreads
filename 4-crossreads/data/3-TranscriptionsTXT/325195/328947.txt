24.9.15Friday 24thNelson, Stan, Les & I were working hard yesterday afternoon putting in a small trench off the firing line to make ourselves comfortable on the 'phone during the winter the ground is very hard & the trench 6 or 7 feet deep so we did not get far in, & then last night we were on duty on the 'phone all night 3 hrs 20 minutes each & we put in a very cold uncomfortable night: & this morning we came to the conclusion that sapping in the day time & on duty during the night was a little above a joke & I decided to see the Adjutant as Nelson seems afraid to say what he thinks to him, we were given the same 'phone (that was condemned by the General) after it had an expert onto it who fixed it right enough for about an hour then it turned dog on us & we could not use the buzzer on it, but managed right enough by speaking through it till 2 oclock this
