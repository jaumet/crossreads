<p>saying &quot;Hard Luck, Harold&quot; but the Major says you are the only officer available for Orderly Officer,&quot; so up I get after&nbsp; 90 minutes sleep carry on with the day&#39;s work; I&#39;ve got to wait up until 10.15 tonight hence this long letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I discussed a few ideas and ambitions re. my commercial future with Mr.Clarke, he says that there is every possibility of my doing well along those lines if after the war I am able as I was before enlistment.&nbsp; It sounds good, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With best wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.</p>
