about 11/2 miles by the line & after a walk of an half an hour arrived at the Station.
Namur is just the same as other towns with its narrow winding streets & cobble stone roads & narrow cement block footpaths, there were a large number of civilians promenading also soldiers from all regiments, the shops were well stocked & food was very dear also clothes and boots, I passed several butchers & beef & mutton was marked 41/2 francs 3/9 a half a kilo equal to about 11/4 lbs in English weight.
Boots from 100 francs upwards. The ladies of Namur are dressed very stylish & like their French sisters are very pretty, they are admired very much by the boys. After walking about for two hours & buying Books of Views, also several very pretty cards of Belgian Ladies & Gentleman. The ladies costumes were touched up with gold tuit [?] also surroundings & the price was 31/2 each which were very cheap, we started for the Depot, intending to catch a tram if possible which by the way are electric on some routes & steam on the others.
