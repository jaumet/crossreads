 At Sea. 21st March 1916. 
 My dear Mother, 
 As you can see by the above address we are now At Sea again, bound for further action, though where we are not allowed to say. 
 Thank goodness we have at last left Egypt and I can tell you I am very pleased to get away from the land of Desert and Dirty Niggers. 
 We are on a decent ship this time, and the tucker is pretty good, though she is rather overcrowded.  The weather has been pretty rough and wintry and just at present we are preparing for rougher which is coming up fast.  Thank goodness I am a good sailor, though an innoculation a few days ago shook us all up a bit.  What do you think of this for a luxury for a Private &ndash; We have a swimming-bath on board, though the water is too cold to induce us to patronise it too often. 
 Don't forget my address for the future is &ndash; 
 5th Coy. Aust. Machine Gun Corps, 5th Brigade &ndash; A.I.F. 
 You will know the address I suppose almost as soon as we do. 
 As per usual when At Sea I am feeling tip top.  The Major is on board, but have had no chance to have a talk with him. 
 News on board is necessarily scarce so please excuse brevity.  Its some time now since we had a mail, but there ought to be one waiting when we get there. 
 By the way the day before we left Egypt I received a parcel of tobacco from Billy which was very acceptable.  I will drop him a line when we settle down a bit. 
 Hope you are all keeping well at home, and gathering up a lot of news to write to me. 
 Love to All, From Your loving Son, Roy.
