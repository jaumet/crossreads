 about 10 miles to the Casualty Clearing Station, where I enjoyed a lovely hot bath, &amp; a complete change of underclothes.   I felt a new man, had an excellent dinner, roast mutton, baked potatoes &amp; baked rice.   Returned to camp by car about mid night, of course no one is supposed to leave the camp, but I thought it was about time that I took things into my own hands.   We are all disgusted with a treatment.   Our good luck again news to hand that a couple of German shells landed in the A.D.S. &amp; killed 2 men &amp; wounded several others.   During the night a German Aeroplane flew over a couple of A.M.C. Clearing Stations, about 10 miles from here, &amp; dropped bombs.   Many men were injured, a contemptible trip, bombing hospitals.   What military achievement is this, it is absolutely cold blooded murder.    Sunday 12th November.   Attended Communion Service conducted by Capt. Ward.   I have attended a great number of these Services since landing in France.  I like them extremely.   In the afternoon I made up my mind to write a number of letters, but unfortunately we had to work again, all this accounts for my neglect in my correspondences.   This completes my experiences since I last wrote to you.   Please excuse this terrible writing but this is written in great haste.   For the next fortnight it may again be impossible to write, but I will do my best as you know.   A Glorious &amp; Happy New Year
