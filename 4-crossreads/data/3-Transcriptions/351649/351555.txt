<p>by the time you get this letter, I sincerely hope to be approaching the end of this training work, and hope to be able to get along satisfactorily with my exams:  they must surely want nearly every available man at present.</p>
<p>It is rather funny that some of the very best men in the Field Artillery are the last to get to the front:  the reason is that if they know their work well, they are given perhaps a Captaincy, and left in England to train some of the new batteries, for you can understand that the men, as well as the officers, are only chocolate soldiers at present:  then by the time the battery is competant, the Captain will also have improved considerably himself:  for of course the training is miles too short to make officers of anything like the regulars standard.</p>
<p>I hope all this shop talk has not bored you, but one gets obsessed with it &ndash; its thoroughly on my nerves, especially as it is nicer to do well than badly.</p>
<p>I hope Riverina is prosperous and smiling once more, and that we get a good run of years to par for the war:  With kind regards &amp; good luck to you &amp; john.</p>
<p>Ever yours sincerely<br/>Jock Ellis</p>
