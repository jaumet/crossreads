 Billjim to some Critic We ll own they smash the Wuzza up , And stoush the Red cap black and blue ; We ll own they quaf the festiv cup , And shickker on the amber brew . There 's alway a percentag strong . Of rowdi fool in everi game , But that do n't make the good crowd wrong Or brand the decent chap the same . All "pushit " did n't stay at home Some blatant bush skite hop out too Do n't blame the lot becaus you find In everi hundr one or two . I ve seen ?em die puff a ?fag ? Bloodi and tortur sport a grin Heap up beneath their countri 's flag Pile with the dirt they die to win .
