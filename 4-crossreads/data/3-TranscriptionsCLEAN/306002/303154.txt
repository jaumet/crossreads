19.5.15attack, & suffered most.  Mansell was also found outside our trenches dead.  At 1 oclock we were relieved from the trenches by the 3rd L. Horse & were soon on our way for a spell.  A few "Jack Johnsons" fell in the valley this morning & we passed about 20 lads who were killed during the night & this morning.  They are stacked in a dug out till night & then carted down nearly to the beach & buried.  We had a stiff climb up a hill & found we were on the wrong one & just settled down on the next when we received the order to stand to arms & were hurried up the hill opposite & put in the trenches to support the 2nd L.H., very heavy fighting all day.  The Turks made a couple of half-hearted attacks on the trenches, but we mowed down every time & our casualties were practically nil.  We had to sleep in the trenches all night.
