 September 1915 Friday 17 Fine Windy    Preparing to move tents and equipment to new camp site. Very windy. A regular tornado. We have field kitchens to do our cooking in now. A French General inspected the Batt. yesterday in fact all of the old Division. 
 Saturday 18 Fine Breezy   Dug trenches around our tent this morning to allow the water to drain away and not flood the tent like it did down on the old camp site. Played cards and won a packet of Major Wrapkins cigarettes.
