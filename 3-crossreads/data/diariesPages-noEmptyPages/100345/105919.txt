Sunday Jan 30th
a fine clear day : cold in the morning night : revellie 6 am : nothing before breakfast : chirch parade 9.45 am very nice : we had made arrangements to go to the deadcity trip had to meet the guide at 11.15 am. Just as we had got our tucker water bottles out ready to leave on our trip the "alarm" sounded we had to double up turn out in full marching kit. The ammuntion &am; rations came out : It was fair dinkum this time : camel corps light horse turned out : we were all happy with the expectation of having a scrap : the rumour was that the natives had risen : after a while we were marched to our tents for dinner told to stand by our arms equipment : had to turn out again about 2 pm for another "alarm" after standing to arms for a while : we gave the general salute which looked very pretty with fixed bayonets at the "present". This must have been rather "real? as the A.M.C. also turned out the officers had their revolvers buckled on aeroplanes buzzed around overhead. We were very disappointed at not having a scrap. It is a funny feeling no sign of fear : just a desire to be in it doing something : I learned afterwards that a riot of some sort had occurred out Mena way with the natives but I don't know whether it was a fact
