Sunday 18 November 1917.
Moved out at 11 a.m. & travelled through several villages and orchards. The scent of the blossoming hedges is beautiful. The orchards have been well kept & watered.
Bivouacked 2 miles from sea.
(A crook camping ground practically a bed of thistles).
No picquet for me tonight.
