few of the stokers of the ship had gone off and got drunk. The Captain and other officers of the ship went out to look for them in motor cars. We saw a few of them being brought up the gangway in a more or less helpless condition. They were all brought back but one. A man of the sailor class was standing on the wharf with a few others. As the officer was about to pass him a few words passed between them and they both got into the motor car. The car hurried away and about ten minutes after returned with the new stoker carrying his kit bag. This scene greatly amused the onlookers who gave him a hearty cheer as he mounted the gangway.

About 7 o’clock the gangway was raised and we slowly moved away from the pier. There was a large crowd, we got a splendid send off and amidst great enthusiasm we sailed away.

The comment of the troops on board was that we had seen the last of Aust – for some time at least. Tonight is beautiful.

The ship sails with a bit list all to the one side which is not very safe looking. It is also rolling considerably. It is like walking a greasy pole at times getting along the deck.

Have read the "Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dicken. Thoroughly delighted with the story.

A meeting of the men in order to form a Sports Committee tonight
