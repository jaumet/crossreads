Orders arriving for Davis to leave for England I took over the 22's again tried a case at Orderly Room and put in a fairly busy morning. Lunched and with Gorman Scales Selleck found Major Charlton A.T.C good enough to take us in his car out to see the 1st beat the 2nd Division at Chatelet. A splendid ground and a good day out. The first Divn proved altogether too good. Motored home in quick time and dined fixed up some papers and went to the pictures. Today we hear of all leave stopped again on account of English strikes and I am sorry all the more because I hear talk of the men getting rather dissatisfied and citing the Canadians as an instance where force brought good results. The necessity for a finger on the pulse of the men becomes a need.
