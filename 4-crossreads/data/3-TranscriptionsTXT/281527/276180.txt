and picked up my horse at  Hotel de Faucon but did not see the groom. Made for the Officers Club which is a good place and does you well. Had a haircut & shave here and then found Murphy my groom. Returned to the Club where there seemed to be a rather willing clique of potters up who were inclined to get noisy and make a good deal of row. The old square tower of the hotel de Yiele and the square turret of St Vaast are distinctly Flemish and in a shop up the street. I heard the Flemish patois being spoken. Dined very well at the Club and at 8 pm left there with Murphy for Warrington Lines. An amusing kid to talk to is Murphy & full of gossip & yarns.
