  
 October, 1915 Wednesday 27 Heavy bombardment by Howitzer Naval guns & Field guns - 2 of our men wounded, most of us have good dugouts, but Fleas are bad, the men recommend changing the shirt & then the Fleas die of a broken heart walking around - too cold for  Bugs  but some [indecipherable] of Scotch Greys may be met. Have not had my clothes off yet, too busy getting under ground - 
 We get messages heliographed from the War ships who get it by wireless, the principle events in the  world  each day. Among the above pests may be added the odd centipede & scorpion.
