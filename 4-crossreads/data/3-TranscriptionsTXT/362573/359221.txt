 Well I think I will now end this letter as I am shure you are tired of wading through my bad spelling &amp; writing.  Give my love to Hilver &amp; I hope she is well &amp; as nice as ever.  Remember me kindly to your Jack.  Well I will say good bye till Germany is under. 
 I am Yours sincerly Dave
