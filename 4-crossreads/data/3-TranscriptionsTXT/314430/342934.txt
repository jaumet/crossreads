 September 21T:- Rumoured today that one of the Battalions in the 5th Brigade is to be broken up. The "Green Diamonds" gave an entertainment this evening in  on  a rubberoid structure previously used by the Germans, who were in occupation here until driven out about three weeks ago. One franc was charged for admission. At the Australian Base at Le Havre, where there is a fair degree of comfort and no worry, entertainment is given free. Why are men away up here in the line forced to pay? 
 September 23rd :- A long typewritten notice appeared on the Company notice board today concerning the breaking up of battalions. The following extracts contain the essence of the announcement:- 
 "Reorganisation of Brigades. Bringing "of Brigades to the three Battalion basis" "This has been completed throughout "the Army partly on account of the man "power situation, but partly also on account "of the tactical constitutions on the anology "of the French, American, and German "Regiments. "Upwards of six months ago the "War Office urged the Australian Government "to follow suit in this reorganization and the " bringing * of brigades of the A.I.F. to the three "Battalion basis." 
 * Cannot decipher my shorthand character for the word to come in here, but "bringing" seems to be a suitable substitute.
