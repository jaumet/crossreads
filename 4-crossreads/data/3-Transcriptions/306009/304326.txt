<p>1915<br/>May. 20 Thu.<br/>On my own all day &amp; kept pretty busy until 10 p.m. To-morrow (Friday) is the week day on which 12 different Hospital returns have to be made up so that I shall have something to do to-morrow. I find the clerical work very interesting &amp; not at all monotonous as one does not get into a groove.<br/>Colonel Sir Frederick Treves (King's Physician) visited Gezira Palace to-day.</p>
