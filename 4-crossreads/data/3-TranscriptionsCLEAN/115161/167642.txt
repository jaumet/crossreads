  
 Ah! at last here it comes.  We hear a voice away down the other end of the trench.  The voice comes nearer, but it is not the voice of the Q.M., and we hear language from some of the dugouts near by.  What!  "Get up, fighting order, move off in half an hour".  Am I dreaming or have I gone mad?  No, it is neither.  A head appears at the entrance to our dugout and the unmistakeable order is repeated "Get up, fighting order, move off in half an hour." 
 We hurl questions and "language" at the sergeant-major, but receive no reply.  We wonder! but there; what's the good?  No! it's useless our asking the reason, our swearing, all useless.  That order needs no translation, we have heard it before, we are in fact used to it, if not,then it's about time we were.  We are soldiers, (pretty poor ones some of us, but still we come under the classification  of  as such,) and "it's not the reason why, it's but to do or die", applies to us. 
 And so again our "spell" is only in our imagination, our "rest" only a myth, and even our "rum issue" fails to materialise.  Ye gods! 
 Are we downhearted now.  Well!  I ask you, would you be? 
 CHAPTER XXV111. 
  AGAIN A "THUD ." 
 Our spirits had risen to a pretty lofty rung, simply to have the "ladder" suddenly give way and brings us crashing back to earth, with a thud.  Ye gods! it was some thud too. 
 Everything dry and clean, even to my rifle, boots polished ready to "swank" in the villages or towns through which we should pass.  There had also been much slaughter among the "chats", in fact we were all as clean and comfortable as we could expect to be, and then for it all to result in this. 
 "Get up, fighting order, move off in half an hour".  What a thud!  What a waste of time cleaning our things!  Not even an issue of rum to put fresh heart into us, no just nothing except that wretched order, which allowed no doubt to dwell in our minds that there was urgency required.
