Whatever you do, don't forget to read over your Latin, French &amp; English compositions, before hand up your papers.  With any unseens, take your time and keep cool, and don't forget to try for an "A" in Latin &amp; English.  This is all I can think of to tell you.  The best of good luck, Mick, and I shall be thinking of you all round the November periods and hoping for bonza results.
This rest camp is very slow, but yesterday, we had a good time at Castro, the "capital" of this progressive, two-men-and-a-dog, island of Lemnos.  I would like to get to Athens which is not more than 20 hours steam from here, but they are afraid of deserters, &amp; will not give leave.
Expecting a mail in a day or two, so I will write again shortly.  Kindest regards to all the boys &amp; best love &amp; good luck for November.
Ever your affectionateEric
