18/4/18 ? Lavieville
Our parties going out ran into a barrage and had a hot time. Sergt. Corry (a good lad) was killed and Sgt. Perrass was wounded. We have had bad luck with our sergeants this week. The relief was completed in good time. A chilly moonlight night. Our batteries firing their shrapnel could be seen bursting in starry lights over the enemy line. The village has been knocked about since last time. A hot meal was awaiting us down here. The war news from up north is still bad ? evidently the Tommies are still running. If they only heard how our chaps talk.
