<p>Sun. Jan 20</p>
<p>Well I wonder if I shall fill this book up with War News. I sincerely hope not, bur I must say that the war news does not look too promising. Today the weather is much better, so I went for a stroll. Met Bucky Howard. He was evacuated from France with Trench Fever. Maj. Mackenzie was telling me about Bob Roberts. He was quite surprised to hear that Bob was dead. I wonder who will be B. Sec Sergeant now.</p>
<p>Mon. 21</p>
<p>Dick Scholer is on the Staff here, in the Hospital Orderly Room. Mole is in the S.M.O's office. There is quite a crowd of 8th chaps here.</p>
<p>I wonder where my mail has got to. It's about time some arrived. Bricky has had Letters dated Nov 21, but my last from B. A. was Oct 19. Weather good. Nothing to report.</p>
<p>Tues. 22<br/>Got a Letter from Stan Wright also an old one containing a Picture of the Botts; and my membership card. Also got a Letter from a Lady from Hawthorn, Vic, congratulating me on getting the M.M; and a Xmas Card from Stan's Mother.</p>
<p>Today the Camp Commandant went to London to be decorated with C.M.G.</p>
<p>Just as we finished there was a Fire, so we went over to the blaze and found it was "the Blood House" on Fire. (A place of amusement). From what I make of it the show was rotten and the crowd demanded their money back. This was, of course refused, so they set it on Fire. It was only built of wood and composition Roofing and blazed away merrily. Every man in Camp must have been there. Some officers tried to get the men to return to their Parade Grounds, but their efforts were useless. One crowd got hold of the Piano.</p>
