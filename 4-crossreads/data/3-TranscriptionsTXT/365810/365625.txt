I had one from Dorothy.  I have not had letters from home recently - the last was dated July 12th - yet yours were both dated September.  I can't explain the non-arrival of my home mail but am none the less - in fact I am all the more delighted when I get others.  I fancy there must be a heap of stuff somewhere chasing me around but it doesn't catch me up - I never seem to stay in any one place long enough.
This country we are in now is very different from the part we set out from.  It is to be expected that as you go N from the Southern boundary of Palestine where it borders on the desert - the soil should improve & the population increase & that is what we have found.  S of Gaza there are some "hods" where Arabs in a half-hearted fashion grow poor fruit & almonds.  In between the hods they or Bedouins scratch the ground up & plant barley.  Here there are, every few miles, quite modern settlements - mostly Jewish - in each case a village with good stone houses, surrounded by beautifully arranged & tended orchards - oranges, almonds, grapes, olives & figs being grown with a remarkable density of cultivation yet with great success.  You have heard probably of Jaffa oranges - they speak for themselves & are a good recommendation for the country.  The soil is red, sandy, & evidently very fertile.
