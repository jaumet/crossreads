<p>extent that we were out of touch with the companies. Went over and had a yarn with Nelligan and Duggan who are mutually relieving. A fine and bright moon tonight. A good amount of ironmongery is flying about. After relief we commenced silent penetration and pushed our line forward nearly &frac34; mile. The penetration was not peaceful as Huns were encountered frequently. Harry Wall was killed by a shot through the groin and died almost at once. A veteran of the "landing', an M.C. winner and a very gallant gentleman. Corporal Rasdell &amp; 3 others were killed too and there 5 wounded. We secured 3 prisoners &amp; 1 badly wounded from a Mills bomb and covered with bloodstained bandages. The relief went through alright and the succeeding penetration</p>
