 February, 1915 Wednesday 17 Horses are very afraid of Camels &amp; Donkeys, but are looking well. Mens boots are wearing out owing to the gravelly sand, along the Canals plenty of boots were to be had the Turkish soldiers having thrown theirs off when sneaking on to our trenches. I have been made Assistant Adjutant of the Cos Regiment I hear Tommy Redford is a Major on the way over now. Weather getting warmer. Just received Mothers letter of January with Daisy's enclosure, so glad to hear all is well.
