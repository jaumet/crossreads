God, who gave the world it's fairness,Swooning seas and ardent skies;Fashioned it with every rarenessThat could dazzle human eyes;God, who gave me all of these,Help me do without them please.
Giver of the light and flowers,Running stream and forest tree,Help me through the heavy hours, When I think what others see.God, Who took my sight awayHelp me do without it, pray.
The Cost Take back the honour and the fame,The victory we've won,Take all the credit from my name,If this can be undone Let him, my friend that used to beSomehow be given back to me.
Don't mock me with the pride of it,The glory of his death,I only know he sighed a bit-I felt him catch his breath.O God, if miracles can be,May he be given back to me!
