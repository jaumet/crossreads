<p>1919<br/>March<br/>appeared we had danced the ceiling down on top of the wits below, &amp; they were rather annoyed.  We had to suspend the remaining dances of our ball.<br/>I wrote to Mr Brackpool for my camera &amp; received it while here. (The war being now over, we were allowed to use them in France)  Faddy &amp; I had a lot of spare time on our hands at night while in the orderly room &amp; use to spend it playing chess.  Faddy's father had been a champion &amp; had taught him a lot.  I became fairly good at the game.  Emilie &amp; Reine became greatly interested in it &amp; wanted to know how it worked.  Faddy could not explain, so I did.  The King &amp; Queen were of course le roi &amp; la reine &ndash; the Castles &ndash; Chateaux, knights, cavaliers &ndash; bishops, - cures, &amp; the pawns, - les soldats.  They soon saw the idea of the thing &amp; would follow up the game with interest occasionally pointing out where I had made a mistake.  At 9 pm we used to shut up the orderly room &amp; go to their living room.</p>
