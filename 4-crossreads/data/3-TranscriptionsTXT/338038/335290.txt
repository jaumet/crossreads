If it so happened that Pat & I had not been able to get leave to come across during the Summer, you would not like to return, and you may have to put in a winter here alone. Of course Kenneth seems quite allright so far and this fear of having to take him back may be quite dispelled by the end of this winter if he has no trouble - Let's pray it will - In that case Sis of course would be ever so much happier and more settled with you here, and she would not feel so utterly alone - In fact it would be a God send to Sis & Ted to have you both here
