Wifes saying good-bye to Husbands & Sisters to Brothers, & Sweethearts to Sweethearts.  Although I only had Father to say good-bye to, my thought were sad, with the recollection of you one & all.  There was a touch of splendour to all the sadness, when one glanced along the Boat & saw the thousands of Streamers, which were held by friends on Shore to the Boys on the Boat.After a delay of 1 hour, word was given to "Cast off", & then we all realised that we were really leaving Australia.
Heavens!  how slow the huge Boat moved out, as if she was mocking the saddened crowd of Relations & friends, frantically waving their farewells, alas in many cases for the last time.  We were towed down to Mid-stream where we anchored, to the absolute deafening accompaniment of Whistles & Sirens.  Never in the War, has there be such a send off.  All day long crowds of friends have been flashing round the Boat in Launches.
Punctually at 3.30 pm  the anchor was weighed & the nose turned towards the Heads.  of the trip through I cannot say anything, save that one had a choking sensation of lonliness.  Onward we steamed till night fell, no sign of Land, & the constant sound of the waves dashing against the sides of the giant ship.Night, - everything black but we still steam on
