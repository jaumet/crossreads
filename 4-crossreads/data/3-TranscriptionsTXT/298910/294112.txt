 Dull to drizzling. Fairly busy &ndash; night and day. Got official news that "Bagdad" had fallen. Good news comes in about our sector too &ndash; " Irles " &amp; several other Villages captured. Dispensers busy all night testing water, which we think the Germans have been poisoning &ndash; it is Arsenic if anything. Orders are also out about any eatables that Fritz has left behind him.
