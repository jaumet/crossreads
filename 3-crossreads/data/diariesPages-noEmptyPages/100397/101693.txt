I wrote the following. These lines I dedicate to Sister Gee That when Im gone she may remember me
G stands for Ginger
Ginger for pluck
But when Gee eats the Ginger
I wish her good luck
G stands for ginger
Ginger for pluck
I love both Gee and Ginger
Goodbye and goodluck
This is about the first time I have been guilty of writing doggerel in any one's Auto book. I may not get another chance to practise so while here must make the most of my opportunities Gee put two forks in my bed while I was out yesterday Im going to try and Square one of the Sisters to put some Sprigs of Holly in hers tonight before she gets to bed. must Ring down the curtain my love to all at Goonigal, when next you see them
Love to all at Home
from your Affec Bro
