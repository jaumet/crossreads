<p>time wishing for money to go back again. I expect I will be out of this in a week now. 24.2.17 Went to the Quack this morning "well hows the side" "not bad" "Lets have a look" while he was having a dekko he spots a rash on my back  bumped me down to the skin specialist who examined me reckoned I had exzema so have to stop on here now, crook Luck. Theres too much religion in this camp far too much, went into one hall here, and a Parson was spruiking about always smiling</p>
