<p>Shall have to send to Mr Duke for some more money in a day or so, theres one thing it takes a good deal of money to keep me going what with the girls camera's &amp; etc, but it is well spent for I'm having the time of my life.</p>
<p>1st June. This morning Rilen &amp; I went to our new home, a bonza motor car called for us &amp; we rode down in style to Harborne Hall Auxiliary Hospital on arrival we were ushered into a beautiful old oaken hall &amp; there our names &amp; particulars were taken &amp; a nurse (V.A.D) showed us to our room which is by a strange coincidence in No 9. Ward. This is the 3rd time I have been in this number in succession first at Etaples then at the Queens &amp; now here this is a most lovely old place &amp; the gardens &amp; lawns around it</p>
