<p>105<br/>Tour Denefort which commands a view for nearly 40 miles around. Tour Eiffel can be seen in clear weather.</p>
<p>Then we went round Butte a Guay under branching ardours &amp; amid greens &amp; mosses which in the early morning gave that delightful perfume of the bush. Then we reached Croix [indecipherable] which overlooks town. Then striking through the forest &amp; across the road we enter the park of the chateau &amp; follow the ancient avenue of trees to the parterre which is not even imposing in its severity.</p>
<p>French gardens have no grace but are a series of straight lines at right angles to each other. The squareness of angles [indecipherable] ones eyes accustomed to graceful lines &amp; unexpected effects.</p>
<p>The chateau is closed till 2 pm to enable the guardians to take their meals. The shift system being apparently unknown or rather in this country where beaurocracy has replaced autocracy it is a system to let people know that they are merely the people &ndash; the common herd.</p>
<p>We searched vainly for a place to dejeune having passed so many little beauty spots in the forest. Happily we find the Plaines des [indecipherable] which though surrounded by public roads 100 yds away yet is completely private. Then we visited chateau (of which pc best explain) with its wealth of Napoleone</p>
