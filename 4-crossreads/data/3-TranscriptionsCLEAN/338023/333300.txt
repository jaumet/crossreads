This is partly due to the presence in the fold, of certain artists of the pencil & brush. They have even fixed up fancy signs for the canteen, the best being after this style [there follow the words "Refreshments Ices" which surround a sketch of a distorted face wearing a four peaked cap with bells and a picture of a drink] A benign devil leers from the walls as above and indicates the things that are not etc etc. 
 The mob next door has started a zoo. A Welshman has four horny toads, big brown beasts covered with warts, that he is teaching to perform  They seem intelligent. A couple of the RND's have a pair of newts in a pickle bottle. These miniature alligators consume large quantities of worms. Hearing of the new departure, a party of hussars further along the line came along and invited all hands to come and see the pair of Scotch Linnets that had just been sent from home. The unsuspecting nature students went. On the wall front of the Cav. hut they saw a handsome new cafe. Inside it, perched on sticks, a pair of brand new woollen toy birds from Grantham penny bazaar. On being asked to whistle to the linnets, the RND's got mad and the Hussars and Dragoons have gone away for a bit to let things cool down. I have a lovely Hussar overcoat that does not interfere with my legs when walking & has a ten inch collar and double front.
