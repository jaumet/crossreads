Gee! we will look little circuses when we have all our glad rags on!<br/>A meeting was held after tea to decide whether we would proceed to Sydney by the Port Sydney or by train.<br/>The boat is lousy and the crew are trying to stay in Sydney for Xmas and to further their ends they will feign illness so as the boat will be quarantined. The boys found this out and have decided to send delegates to interview the Colonel.<br/>30th At a mass meeting of N.S.W. and Queensland men</p>
