<p>3.  Padre that we must have Music so He told me to buy some.  Of course I'll buy some good stuff while I have not to pay for it.  After 5 o/ clock Tea we sat by the fire yarning &amp; looking over photos etc until about 8 pm &amp; then I went over with Mr Fremantle to the Cathedral.  We went all around the Place to see if the Doors were all locked.  I saw the Statue &amp; Tomb of a crusader, a former Earl of Salisbury, who was killed at the Siege of Jerusalem 700 years previously.  All the flags were flying yesterday in honour of the capture of Jerusalem.<br/>Of course Tuesday is always Market Day &amp; in the market square you can buy anything from lingerie to fat pigs.  I rode home alone.  It is a long way then but I know every inch of the road &amp; it only takes about an Hour &amp; by train it takes from 1 &frac12; hrs to 2 &frac12; hrs so I don't lose any time by it.  I saw a strange light at the 4 mile peg.  I thought it was a chap with a puncture.  No, it was a Bobby looking out for lamps not lit.  But mine were alight &amp; even so He could not have caught me.  There is only one chap on the road that can beat me &amp; He does the journey 4 times a week &amp; has a racing machine.<br/>Ellis has gone to Sarum to-day, so I am all alone.  I've several letters to write but I shan't do them all to-night.  I had the nerve killed &amp; taken out of a Tooth to-day &amp; it has been filled also so my jaw is a bit tired like.<br/>Well, Mum, I want to write to Marie</p>
