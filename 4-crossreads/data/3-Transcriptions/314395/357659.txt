<p>dry shack, hence I have had plenty time and opportunity to write this, which I call, your Christmas letter, although it may be a little late in arriving.  However I wish you the merriest of all Xmases &amp; the most prosperous of all New Years.  I only wish to God I was at your table to enjoy it with you, but still I'm fighting, that yours may not be molested, and that's sufficient compensation.</p>
<p>In future you may have the pleasure of addressing me as Sgt. as I have gained another promotion.</p>
<p>Your affect. Son<br/>George</p>
