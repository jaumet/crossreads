 Very hot &amp; many Flies &amp; much sand &amp; we're off again tomorrow night for more Scrap with out Posts- We don't seem to be doing much actual fighting but we're keeping the Turks back from the Canal, we have been 8 weeks now with our Camels the only link with  to  civilization till the Military train pushes on.  Thank you for 2 Australasians arrived today May 7 &amp; 13th.  A Taube flew over again this morning, took some photos [indecipherable], but dropped no Bombs, our machine turned out later, but after we fired a few shells at the German he cleared out.
