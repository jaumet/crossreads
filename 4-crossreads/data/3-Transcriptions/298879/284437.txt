<p>September 1915<br/>Wednesday 15<br/>Rained heavily through the night. Our flags were wet through and we had to take the panniers[?] and put them in a tent. We are having an easy time up to now.</p>
<p>Thursday 16<br/>Fine Beautiful morning. Lovely fresh sweet air. Was up before reveille and went about half a mile to a spring and had a good wash in fresh water. A terrific downpour of rain with thunder and lightning completely flooded all our tents. We were just about to shift camp to higher ground.</p>
