 this: of course it was Fritz who should have been blamed. But the men seemed to ignore him when airing their grievances. 
 Our Divisions are, I am sure, treated fairly in every way. But it is not an advantage to be so far from home. Letters reach the men at rare & long intervals. Australian uniforms, boots, etc., were unobtainable until quite lately. The Battalions had assumed a piebald appearance, very few men being dressed alike. These little difficulties seem small from a distance, but when endured so far away amidst dangers & other difficulties they appear much larger. Certainly the spirit of the men making their was to the Somme for the second time was not nearly as good as on the first occasion. But although it was not pleasant to notice this change on the journey down, it was certainly wonderful to notice how the  grumbling  lessened as we neared, & finally ceased when we reached the front line. 
 I am certain that the A.I.F. will never let Australia down-at the front, even though the failure of conscription has made their task more difficult. 
 The 18th relieved the 25th, a Queensland Battalion. We went up through awful mud. About 30 or 40 Queenslanders were lying out in front of the trench, the 25th having delivered an unsuccessful attack on the opposite trench the same morning. The Artillery fire was not nearly so heavy as at Pozieres (for us), though everything in the shape of supplies had to come through the enemy's slow barrage. The mud & cold were our chief difficulties. The trench was little more than linked up shell holes. At times the rain & wet cause big slices of the side to cave in.
