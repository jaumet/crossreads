(48)Can you march away and leave the place where the Jesus and the Mary are without a thought?Nay, can you do so, without a host of thoughts?Thoughts which come to question, and disturb, and haunt.That place you have just now seen was once a homeHome, Ah what does that word mean.It means all that which men may write of it, and much more which none may write nor tell.It means the love and joy, laughter and music, fear and care, faith and duty, ambition, regret, gain loss and grief: and sorrow and despair, and the loyalty and honour of a little world.
