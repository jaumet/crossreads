<p>at 12.50 I crossed by the free ferry to the South Side, caught a train at Beresford square for Eltham.  On the way out passed Woolwich arsenal, Military Academy.  The house where Gordon was born, Shooters Hill where Tony Weller father of Sam Weller immortalised by Dickens in Pickwick papers, settled in a hotel.  Arrived at Eltham at 1pm &amp; proceeded by bus for some distance finally arriving at the beautiful little town of Sidcup about 1.30.  As the directions I had received were very clear I had no difficulty in finding Mr Newtons house in Manor Road.  The moment I arrived he just came to the gate with his wife &amp; little daughter Altie, one of the sweetest &amp; prettiest little girls of 4 years I have ever seen.  Mr Newton was just going off</p>
