miles behind the firing line, there are great guns all round us.
Just opposite us the metalled road ends, if ever I saw a bog in my life well it is here all carts are double banked when the reach here, you should see the struggling it takes to get through it, there is no water among this mud, just pure sticky clay 3 feet deep, horses get stuck in it let alone wagons, our boys were helping fallen down horses up tonight it is impossible to describe it for it is a regular glue pot. I saw tonight one of our little machine gun carts which is drawn by 3 men stuck, 2 horses about 20 men had to drag it out, the traffic never ceases there is one perpetual string of vehicles day night
