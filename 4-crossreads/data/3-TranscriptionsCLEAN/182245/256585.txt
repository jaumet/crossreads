11 SUNDAY
Fine but came up rain & mist
in the evening. Cleaning
harness all day. Our half
holiday was postponed
till Wednesday on account
of the C.R.A coming round
tomorrow & we had to clean
up everything. A Hun plane
came over & got the baloon
near here. He had three or
four goes at it with a
machine gun & finally
set it alight & got away.
