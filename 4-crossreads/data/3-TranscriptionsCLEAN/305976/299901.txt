  
 The Blue Tiled Mosque was the prettiest. It is electrically lighted by thousands of small lights & we saw them switched on. The effect of these artificial lights on the glistening marble is a sight worth going along way to see. We then visited one of the turrets & had a magnificent panoramic view of Cairo. From here on to the Citadel where I understand some of the long term prisoners are kept. We saw the spot where a German Spy was shot. Joseph's well & returned to Town after a most pleasant afternoon. In the evening our Unit gave an open air concert which turned out successful. Thursday Aug 9th On  Picquet  Picket usual Routine to day.
