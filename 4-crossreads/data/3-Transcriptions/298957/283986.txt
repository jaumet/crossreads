<p>this gear out here. We could well do without most of it.</p>
<p>3rd April (Monday)<br/>Sorting "A" &amp; "B" Stores on account of each section going to a different destination further out. The Transport Sections are to remain at Rail Head also Headquarters. At 6 p.m  "A" Section moved off to Road Head North bound for Duntroon Plateau a distance of 3 miles. The road does not run out all the way &ndash; It ends about a mile short of Duntroon Plateau. We didn't know this till we got there so when it was found that the transport waggons couldn't cross the sand</p>
