Marvels of architecture the Spinx and the Pyramids of Cheops.We left Heliopolis about two o'clock in the morning of August 10th and proceeded to Alexandria where we boarded the Alaunia. The Alaunia took us as far as Lemnos Is. Where we transhipped to small mine sweepers which took us to Anzac Cove where the landing had been made on the glorious 25th of April.We landed at Anzac in the dead of night and went to Reserve Gully where we camped for the night. We were awakened very early by the booming of guns and the screech of shells overhead. The shells we could hear bursting in the distance and the High Explosive seemed just like a big door being slammed in an empty building. During the day I went for a swim and after a swim I watched a howitzer battery in action. I had been told that the shells could be seen after they had left the muzzle of the gun; but I would not believe it. Anyhow it was true and I could the shell looking just like a cricket ball; go up until it reached its highest point and then it turned and disappeared behind a ridge.We moved further north that night and camped in Argyll Gully. Stray bullets were dropping all round us and I didn't feel at all comfortable at first in fact I didn't like it a little bit. But the feeling soon wore off and I settled down to sleep.Next morning I went with a couple of mates for a swim and while having a sun bath we had our first experience of shrapnel fire. We laughed at the first few shells but they began to come closer and we scooted. A nosecap missed me by inches and then you should have seen me break for cover in record closer
