Just before getting on the train tea & food was served out by the Y.M.C.A. and the band played some more. At 1000 all hands got aboard one of the G.W.R. Corp trains & were soon comfortably seated without too much crowding.
It had rained cats & dogs prior to and whilst marching into Warminster but now all the clouds had gone & the silver lining showed bright & clear sunny. We stayed a short while at Bristol where we had a good view of the suspension bridge. Arrived at Exeter
