Tuesday 27 August
At Morcourt sur Somme where we are to rest for a few days just behind the new balloon line. We came out last night everything is very quiet. Our Division's advance is highly mentioned in the papers also is the 15" gun I saw yesterday. I expect we will be in again in a week.
Wednesday 28 August
Wet to-day but find time to go for a walk round the hills overlooking the Somme villages of Cerises Chipilly. Our line here has been advanced again is the right flank of the 50 mile attack to the North. Aquatic sports to-morrow.
