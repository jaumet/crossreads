12/7/19 ChemnitzWarm and sultry. We are off the Straits of Gibraltar and passed two large steamers one of which was evidently coming out of the Mediterranean. Inspected the troop decks. They were all splendid and some of the chaps had put great efforts into their ornamentation. It would have done a housewife's heart good to see them. The clink birds are still occupying their cells and one has a baptismal card up on his wall. "One Faith, one Hope, one Baptism!" About noon went up on to the f'castle head and looked over at the deep violet sea being ploughed back. In the evening on an improvised stage our concert party, all dressed in period costumes, gave a good concert. I had a good yarn with Capt. Young afterwards mainly about his trooping experiences.
