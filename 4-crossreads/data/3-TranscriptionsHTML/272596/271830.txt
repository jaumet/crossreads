<p>1st of January. [1919] Another year started but under far more happier circumstances than any for the past 4 years,  we never went to bed till well after 12 o'clock, we were playing "bridge" till 11 oclock, then an argument started about Egypt &amp; India &amp; this kept on going till the bands came round &amp; told us that the New Year was coming in, they woke practically everyone on the ship &amp; sang all sorts of songs, "Auld Lang Syne" Annie Laurie" "wedoch &amp; Doris" &amp; so on &amp; so on the old year went out, probably one of the most remarkable years of the worlds history certainly for the British Empire for it was touch &amp; go for us, but now we are in a stronger position than ever &amp; the same year saw both these things.</p>
<p>Saw a most remarkable sight</p>
