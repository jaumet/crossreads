  
 Monday 29 March 1915 
 Sir Ian Hamilton is now paying a hasty visit to Egypt and to-day, the set programme of work was cancelled, and a review of the division by this distinguished soldier was substituted.  As on the occasion of last week's inspection by the High Commissioner for Egypt, the whole effect was spoilt by the clouds of dust that arose, as a result of the tread of horses and men in massed formation. 
 At a little after 2 p.m. the division was formed up and at 2.15, with military punctuality, the General came on to the parade ground.  The "G" on the bugle was sounded, and we came to the "Present" for a minute or two.  A salute was played and then the inspection commenced.  It was exactly the same as the last review, only that a keener interest was taken in the troops by the soldier than by the worthy diplomat;  further, we had the newly arrived Maadi contingent on our right, in whom the General took especial interest. 
 The march past was a farce and a very dusty farce at that.  "Keep your eyes to the right and count the number of Sir Ian's ribbons" said the General.  "Lend us your field glasses and we will" was the quick retort.
