Give him my best wishes.Things here are not as bad as they are often painted & tho Fritz succeeded for a while, we are all confident it will not be for long.For Pat's & all our sakes, you & Aunt must try & accept your blow with resignation & if he has to go, send him in the knowledge that come what may you are paying the price cheerfully as a debt to the Empire we love.[indecipherable] with loveYour affectionate nephew
