<p>1918<br/>Tue. 18th Jan.<br/>A sailing vessel was passed at noon.   "Wolf" did not attack, for some reason known only to mein Herr Kommandant.</p>
<p>Wed 23rd.<br/>In a heavy sea we steered S.E. during the morning.   (the usual rumour "We are bound for Las Palmas to intern").   Met "Ingotz" again in the afternoon and parted again soon after.   position 30 degrees N.</p>
<p>Sun. 27th<br/>The Kaiser's birthday &ndash; and a hurricane.   A terrific sea is running, the hurricane deck over our heads is awash and "Wolf" if rolling on to her beam ends.   It quite amused me to hear my German Kamerad in the next bed screaming in terror.</p>
<p>A table crashed down aft and split 3rd Officer "Sandy's" leg almost from knee to ankle.</p>
<p>He is in the new hospital which has been rigged up aft to accommodate some of the more serious scurvy cases.   There is no room for all in hospital.   We are about 35 degrees North.</p>
