 Left house at 2.30 p.m. taking the car which goes to the Citadel.  Reaching the Citadel, before I could get off the car, I was pestered with a guide as per usual and ultimately decided to go with him at the reduced cost of 3 piastres (71/2). 
 We went to two Mosques and also saw the Sultans tombs.  Outside one of the mosques there are numerous marks on the wall said to have been caused by the bombardments of Napoleon's army.  One large hole was pointed out to us.  It contained a round object, a cannon ball, which had lodged there. 
 The few mosques which I have seen since I came here are all pretty much alike as regards architecture and decoration.  They have all beautiful glass stained windows.  The colours Red, Blue, Orange and Green nicely blended.  A border, high up on the wall, written in Arabic all passages from the Koran in golden colours.  There is a niche in the wall of the mosque which faces the east towards the Mohammadan Holy City Mecca.  The mohammedans always pray facing the east.  At this part there is also a narrow staircse leading up to the pulpit.  Devotions are conducted from this pulput every Friday, this day being their Sunday.
