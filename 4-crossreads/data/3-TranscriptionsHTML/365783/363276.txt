<p><u>No. 2.</u><br/>Troopship Kyarra<br/>Victoria Dock<br/>Melbourne<br/>1st December 1914.<br/>Dear old Mrs,<br/>Your letters of 25th &amp; 26th duly reached me also letters from Mother &amp; Margaret. I hope Margaret will continue to write, it is nice to get her letters more particularly when the thoughts expressed in the letter are her own. I was of course delighted to get your letters &amp; hope to hear from you again before we leave Melbourne. There was a great mix up in the storing of the cargo at Sydney &amp; we are at present engaged in getting it all out again &ndash; we will probably not be away from here till Friday. You never saw such a picture as the wharf presents</p>
