<p>20/7/16 (later) Thursday &amp; Friday</p>
<p>I do not know yet whether I am on my head or heels &ndash; but one thing seems to strike me most forcibly &ndash; some good friend of mine &ndash; must have prayed hard &amp; recently for me. For to have come through safely the last two days &amp; nights &ndash; is I take it a good answer to my friends. I really do not know what to say &ndash; but just Hell let loose in its worse form. Shrapnel &ndash; Shell &ndash; Bombs &ndash; Bullets. Deafening &amp; Terrifying &ndash; When ones nerves are good &amp; not carried away but resigned there is a sort of indescribable fascination, &amp; one thinks I've missed that &ndash; but the next may get me. At time of writing 8 pm, a lull. I've had 4 hours sleep out of the 48 hrs &ndash; hurried &amp; not too good snacks as opportunity occurred. Every bone &amp; muscle is aching, my back &amp; loins are as tho broken from carrying our good brave lads, nothing was too much trouble for me to do for them, most of our lads were very good, but regret that in our F.A. we had some</p>
