<p>"Right There" 27.5.15</p>
<p>Dr. Vol</p>
<p>Over a month here &amp; so far well.  Poor old Ted Larkin went down at the start &amp; fell facing the enemy, right in the "forwards".  We had an armistice &amp; buried him, with others.  I got a letter from you recently, while in the trenches, and same was appreciated.  We are having a pretty hard time though are not growling a bit.  Don't talk about coming as I think you wouldn't like it.  Hope you're still doing well.  Poor old Roy Smith got one through both knees right near me on the first day.  Only allowed to write <strike>one</strike> half page, so ta ta.  Give my regards to parents &amp; sisters.</p>
