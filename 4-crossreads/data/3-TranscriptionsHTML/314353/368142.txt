<p>The burning log bursts into flame &amp; cries &ndash;<br/>This is my flower<br/>My death.</p>
<p>Tagore.</p>

<p>The wind of evening cried along the darkened trees,<br/>Along the darkened trees heavy with ancient pain,<br/>Heavy with ancient pain from faded centuries,<br/>From faded centuries ?<br/>Oh foolish thought and rain.</p>
<p>Oh foolish thought and rain to think the wind could know,<br/>To think the wind could know the griefs of men who died,<br/>The griefs of men who died and mouldered long ago:<br/>"And mouldered long ago," the wind of evening cried.</p>

<p>War<br/>Where war has left its wake of whitened bone,<br/>Soft stems of summer grass shall wave again,<br/>And all the blood that war has ever strewn<br/>Is but a passing stain!</p>
<p>Events are never absolute:  their consequences depend entirely upon the individual.  The misfortune which is a stepping stone for a genius, becomes a piscina for the Christian, a treasure for a quick-witted man, and for weaklings an abyss.<br/>Balzac, Rise &amp; Fall C. Birotteau</p>
