2.4.16Sun 2ndNothing of any consequence happened today;  The weather rather warm;  Maj. Smith went to A Sqd & McIntosh & McMahon were sent to hospital at Minia with a bad eye & injured knee respectively;  Beer was 7 PT per bottle here & the Sergeants got some out from Minia & was selling it for 6PT & brought the price of the Canteen down
3.4.16Mon 3rd5 oclock reveille this morning & is to be from now on;  The troops do one hours musketry every morning before breakfast, & a route march this morning after breakfast;  It seems unnecessary to give them so much work when they have been so long in the Army & the days are too hot for comfort when doing no work.Baxter took sick a couple of days ago & has pulled out of the Sigs, I give them work daily
