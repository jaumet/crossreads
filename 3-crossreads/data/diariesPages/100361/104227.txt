Tues . Apr. 9th
Read a very interesting account in today's "Telegraph" about the Australians fighting around Dernancourt. They are keeping up their reputation as some of the World's best Fighting men.
We were billeted at Dernancourt in Oct 1915, when we went to "the Somme" from Armentieres. We know the country around where the heavy fighting is quite well. Sent B'thday Card to B.E., and wrote Mrs Sam Ibbs.

Last night Minnie, our cat, was very restless, and this morning we found the reason why. 5 kittens arrived.
The Band were photographed with Col. Knox, as he is going back to Australia in a few days.
Capt Gettingly went away this morning. Went to Concert at Y.M.C.A "The Tourists". Not much of a show.
