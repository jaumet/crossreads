Have been playing bridge nearly all night it is now 12.30 we left off to attend the funeral then started again, so you can see we have spent a pretty quiet Xmas Eve.
25th. Xmas Day the second I have spent on the ocean 5th since leaving Australia 2 in France 1 in Egypt 2 on the sea, this one is easily the happiest for the war is over the world is now resuming its former quiet occupation giving up cutting each others throats, I slept on deck as usual rose or rather was pulled out by Penfold about 6.30 who was wishing all sundry a Merry Xmas etc, folded up my blankets rolled them into the hammock then down stairs to sling them in the bin there for a wash to get the grime off for sleeping on deck though cool nice
