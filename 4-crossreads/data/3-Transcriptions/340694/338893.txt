<p>8<br/>over at the Coy.</p>
<p>15/5/16<br/>Nothing startling happened to-day, only hot wind &amp; dust it was terrible. Was inoculated this afternoon &amp; my arm is beginning to get stiff &amp; sore. No mails at all to-day expect some to-morrow.</p>
<p>Everything points to a speedy departure, our Egyptian money is to be changed into English. On everyone's lip is the question "When are we going?"</p>
<p>17/5/16 9-15 am.<br/>I was on the point of writing up yesterday's doings last night when an urgent despatch was required to be taken over to Divisional Hd Qrs. &amp; I was the only one available.</p>
