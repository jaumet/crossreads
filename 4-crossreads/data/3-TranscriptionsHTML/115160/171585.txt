<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>We left Laudrecies over a week ago at 8 am in the rain. &nbsp;Going up a steep hill our bus came to a halt but after a bit of persuasion we got another go on only to finally break down further along. &nbsp;It was dull and cold but it was on a main road that we stopped so we soon had a tow from one of our own lorries that happened to be passing. &nbsp;We swopped on to another at the Column, and got here about 2 pm.</p>
<p>We have had the trains arriving&nbsp;</p>
