  
 packs of lean, swift hounds an array of vessels capable of steaming 33 to 35 knots all in battle order. Then in all the ships the tramp of feet and the rattle of winches were heard, as boats were hoisted in and every object that could cause trouble secured. We are to go out with the First Battle Cruiser Squadron in the small hours of tomorrow morning, so there will not be much sleep on this last night of the War. Tonight, as most of the German Submarines are located, and some are already under lock & key in our pens, we shall carry the usual lights. 
 Thursday 21st 
 Somewhere about 3 am we weighed anchor, and with the battle Squadron leading the line, put to sea. All arrangements were made for the possibility of an attack by submarines or destroyers, but out of the still, black water no enemy showed as the British and American warships steamed at 32 knots to the rendezvous.
