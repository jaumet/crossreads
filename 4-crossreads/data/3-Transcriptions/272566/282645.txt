<p>Monday 17 September</p>
<p>Moving Day.<br/>Trips to Arques, 8th Brigade Sigs. and A.D.M.S. at Blaringhem.<br/>At mid-day I set off following two motor ambulances.  We passed through Hazebrouck, St. Sylvestre, Eecke, Godewaerevelde and Boeschepe to Remy Siding just over the Belgian Border 2 Kilos from Poperinghe.<br/>5 C.C.S's opposite us.  Met Bill Bailey &amp; Rupert Cooke<br/>First impressions of this camp give us the opinion that we are taking over a very comfortable home.</p>
