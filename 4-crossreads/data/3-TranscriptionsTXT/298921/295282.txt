November, 1915Friday 19One could appreciate some fruit & vegetables now, we lose a lot of men for the want of suitable Tucker apart from the continual sniping. But the men are better fed than in Africa & personally as a Jackeroo & droving in the Back country I've had many a rougher time -Honestly sick at all my letters being in the Aegean Sea, I had made a special effort & wrote to most of my friends to bid them Xmas Greetings. To show how necessary Reinforcements are we evacuate each day anything between 350 to 500 men from the Peninsular in the great white Hospital ship.
