exhiliarating & the prospect of such an enjoyable change for the next fourteen days raised the spirits of the Sentry to the highest as he made arrangements for a visit to Aberdeen. This trip was for sight seeing only, but his principal reason for going to Scotland again was to carry out his promise to spend a couple of days with the people he had previously stayed with in Glasgow, so while taking the opportunity of seeing the much talked about "Granite City" he intended to pay a visit to "St Andrews" the Mecca of all golfers. After leaving Aberdeen he entered into conversation with the only other occupant of the R/carriage & it was not long before he ascertained that his fellow traveller was a golfer this is not surprising for almost every Scotsman plays that game.
The Sentry explained that he intended leaving the train at the "Junction" station to be sure to see St Andrews. His fellow traveller said Oh! don't worry! I will tell you where to get out! the name of which station the Sentry also knew.
Conversation started at once on golf, & golf experiences were mutually related & exchanged. As both seemed to enjoy the talk immensely & time passed quickly, of course under the circumstances the Sentry had no anxiety regarding his stopping place with his fellow traveller so conversant with all matters & places locally.
Thoroughly entertained & apparently entertaining the sentry suddenly exclaimed after a glance through the Railway carriage window Why! It is very strange but the surrounding country seems to me to be quite familiar! I could almost have said I know this place! His fellow traveller looking out said Horror! Why we are about to enter Glasgow!!
He looked quite distressingly depressed & was very profuse in his apologies
