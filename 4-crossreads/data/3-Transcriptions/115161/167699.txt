<p>the war was really won, so long as it did not materially affect them.</p>
<p>Villers Brettoneux - the small and apparently insignificant village on the hill overlooking the great city of Amiens - was the deciding point of the whole war.&nbsp; Had the enemy burst through here, then Amiens was his.&nbsp; &quot;He&quot; knowing that, put all he could into the means of gaining a decided victory, and victory seemed very close to &quot;him&quot;, and Amiens seemed almost within his grasp.&nbsp; The coast was very close, and with Amiens his, the whole of the allied armies would be cut in two, and the &quot;day&quot; would have been &quot;his&quot;.&nbsp; The whole thing looked so very simple from that ridge on which stood this village.</p>
<p>Well! as the French will tell you, and as history will relate later, the city of Amiens was saved by the dogged pluck and bull-dog determination of the 13th. and 15th. Brigades of the Australian Army, at Villers Brettoneux in April 1918, and the French people will never forget this marvellous achievment.</p>
<p>This reverse was the beginning of the end.&nbsp; The enemy had put his very best into this venture, but he came up against better stuff than he could produce.&nbsp; He did not know what Australian were.&nbsp; He was not acquainted with the determination and doggedness of the &quot;digger&quot;.&nbsp; He met him (to his sorrow) at Villers Brettoneux, and I don&#39;t think &quot;he&quot; will forget him in a hurry either.</p>
<p>Villers Brettoneux belongs to Australia, as does also Meucke [Mouquet?] Farm, and a few other places I could mention.&nbsp; But the former stands out as a master-piece of Australian determination and endurance.</p>
<p>The enemy never did like meeting our fellows, but this action made &quot;him&quot; realise more than ever what &quot;he&quot; was up against, when he pitted himself against the only purely volunteer army opposed to him.</p>
<p>A very fine cemetery is here, where many of our dead have been transferred to.</p>
