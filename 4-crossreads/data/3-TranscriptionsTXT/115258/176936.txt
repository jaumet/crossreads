 sister Mrs Moffit (She was Mary Ayre and he thinks you may have known her) has just died. Some Melbourne doctors operated on her for appendicitis but found that there was nothing wrong with her - but she died from the operation. Poor old Jim was very upset about it. I was telling Jim the other day, when we were eating a water mellon together about those Corridale mellons Father grew. I told him they were a cross between an apple cucumber and a rock mellon and that &nbsp;they were jolly nice. I told him we would give him some seed when the was was finished; but  t he wants the mellons to eat then so would Father send some seeds to Jim&#39;s brother for him to grow? His address is Gordon Ayre Elwood Hay. Dont think there is any more news Mother. Another mail is expected in today so I&#39;ll write again when it comes. Love to Father, Fred and yourself. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson
