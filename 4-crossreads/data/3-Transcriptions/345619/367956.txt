<p>here, on porridge &amp; puddings, then at 10AM &amp; 10PM we get a cup of hot milk, at least some of us do.</p>
<p>20-9-18 There has been nothing to write about these last few days, so this will be a short letter. Am still in bed my foot is getting a bit better, not quite so swollen &amp; painful &amp; I have had quite a few decent nights sleep lately, and I can actually make a slight movement in my foot. I am enclosing a postcard taken of our ward with your husband in the foreground, I don't suppose it is necessary to mark it as you are sure to pick out my hard face, see my coat on the Chair, my crutches against the wall which I have only used a couple of times, and the wire frame on my bed to keep the weight of the bed clothes off my foot, And isn't the Ward nice and bright? it was built for a "Skittle-Alley" all the men in the picture are convalescents and there is one Sister, I have one for Mother and will send it to her shortly. Had a letter from Mr Owen this morning, the battalion was still out spelling on 15th but was going up forward in a few days. Also had letters from Lovegrove &amp; Vallack, the former still has the Canteen job, the latter was out spelling, but would be forward again now.</p>
<p>The news is still good from the Front, I don't think the will be much of the War left by the time my foot is well, so I will not have another chance to get some Souvenirs to take home. Some men who lost a leg the same day that I was wounded, are now hopping about here on crutches and here I am, I still in bed, I asked today if I could get up in a chair, But the Dr said "not", my wound is reduced</p>
