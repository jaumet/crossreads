<p>January, 1917. Friday 26<br/>Cold &amp; bitter wind but frost lighter. Supposed to be a truck on big siding but shelling was still going on so came home at 10. Parcels for Ingram. Spent afternoon chopping wood and evening in a quiet rest. Aerial activity great and heavy artillery on right. Clean up camp to-morrow.</p>
