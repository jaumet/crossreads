smells to let one pay much attention to architecture. Large flock of goats with shepherds. Noticed most houses of any size with two doorkeepers. Native cafe full of niggers sucking hookahs. Native string band resting.
Passed 23rd marching back to camp with bayonets fixed, splendid swing and splendid suntanned big men. Our Brigade has won its reputation of being Australia's physical best. The survivors of so many medical examinations cannot have much wrong with them. The full lips weak mouths and lack lustre debauched looking eyes of Egyptian tram passengers most striking. Among this better class even the amount of eye trouble most marked.
Crowd of women (nunlike) at well carrying kerosene tins of water on the head balancing without any effort
