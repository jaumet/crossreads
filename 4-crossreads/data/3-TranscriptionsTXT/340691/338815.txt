 Absent. 
 Sometimes between long shadows on the grass The little truant waves of sunlight pass My eyes grow dim with tenderness the while Thinking I see thee smile. And sometimes in the twilight gloom apart The tall trees whisper  heart  whisper heart to heart Thinking I hear thee call. 
  Because.  
 Because you come to me with naught save love And hold my hand and lift mine eyes above A wider world of hope &amp; joy I see Because you come to me. Because you speak to me in accents sweet I find the roses waking round my feet And I am led through tears &amp; joy to thee Because you speak to me. Because God made thee mine I'll cherish thee Through light &amp; darkness &amp; all time to be And pray his love may make our love divine Because God made thee mine. 
 God send you back to me. 
 Love you have left me weary and lonely. Sailing so far away Ah how I miss you- daily I'm praying Safely you'll come home someday. Though we are parted- love lives for ever When hearts are fond and true. So, till our meeting, let us remember Ever I pray for you. God send you back to me. Over the mighty sea Dearest I want you near God dwells above  one  you Knows how I love you He will bring you back to me
