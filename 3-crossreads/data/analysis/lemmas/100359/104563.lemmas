 we have been look forward to so long , happen , we steam slowli ahead to Franc . Pass along between the rocki land on either side the citi of Marseill came , slowli into view . Wharv in everi direct and ship of everi nation load and unload their cargo . Just near where we tie up a parti of German prison were at work , under an arm guard . They were load truck with rail , and seem to be on good term with the French Officer in charg . A number of French girl came around the boat play melodeon and sing and they reap a rich harvest of coin . We came ashor about 4 and hung about till 4.30 then we march through the town to the station . The French peopl made s feel almost as though we were home , they wave their hat and handkerchief and gave us a most cheer welcom . We got aboard the train and left Marseill at about 5.30 . The countri we pass through was a surpris to us all . To tri and describ it would be wast time .
