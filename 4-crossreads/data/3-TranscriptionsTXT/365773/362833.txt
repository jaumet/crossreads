 Hospital 29.1.17 My dear Sister, Just a short note to inform you that I am O.K. again &amp; will be leaving here for the line tomorrow, am quite strong again &amp; feeling very fit. The cold here is now intense we have had over a weeks frost &amp; everything with a touch of moisture is frozen stiff. I feel it very much I didn't think previously that it could get so cold &amp; am now praying for spring &amp; a little heat. Tell Mother
