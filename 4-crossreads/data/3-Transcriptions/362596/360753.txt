<p>after carrying a rifle and revolver for the past 3 &frac12; years.<br/>Well May I was awarded the Military Medal for the 9/8/18 for doing a bit of brisk work. I have not got the medal yet but I am wearing the ribbon. I suppose I will be decorated later by one of our Generals so that is not so bad is it, and of course there may be more to follow if this war continues but I don't think it will last long now do you?<br/>Well May I will have to ring off for this time trusting you are all enjoying the best of health as this scrawl leaves me at present.<br/>I remain<br/>Your loving Uncle<br/>Clarence</p>
