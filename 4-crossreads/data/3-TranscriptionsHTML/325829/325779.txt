<p>I was given the task with 2 Sqdns &amp; a demolition party of New Zealand Engineers. As it was impossible to make an attempt in daylight, it was decided to wait until dark &amp; then make a detour to strike the railway N of Amman. I fully understood that we could hope for no support should we get into difficulties, so it was a case of getting through as quickly &amp; silently as possible. On several occasions parties of Bedouins were surrounded but proved to be friendly: these we however took with us in case they should give the alarm. We successfully carried out our programme blowing up a big bridge over the Wadi Amman. [Refer to page 567, volume VII Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-18.  Date of action 28 March 1918.] Practically no opposition was met with &amp; we returned to camp on the following day. General Ryrie received a wire from Division congratulating the Bgde &amp; all concerned in the success of the enterprise. On the 29th Inst [March 1918] the Regt took over a section of line between the 6th &amp; 7th Regts. our task being to guard against any attack from the North. Enemy reinforcement could be seen marching towards Amman from the N. &amp; they held a ridge about 1500 yards from our line&amp;kept up a very hot fire from numbers of machine guns, especially if anyone showed up on the Skyline. Several men &amp; horses were hit by "overs" from these guns &amp; various snipers; but there was no appearance of any attack in force from that quarter.</p>
