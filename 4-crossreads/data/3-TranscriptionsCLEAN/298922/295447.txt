 Bombed again. 1000s of acres of Crops are ready for the Strippers here & we are eating it down by grazing Camels & Horses, & the ground has only been scratched by a wooden Plow yet bearded Barley & Wheat are good. I have already told you of natural grasses but no Timber of any description - rolling open downs. 
 This is the great Revolution Day & I wonder if the Socialists in Germany will show up the real feelings of the MASS of the HUNS - one would think the world was getting tired of WAR. Moved Camp again.
