<p>What are Mr [Colerians?] initials?<br/>Do you think Father would ask Mr McDonald to let Ronald know I am coming over, he might be able to get me into his troop.<br/>We are a very happy family on board &amp; I am enjoying the trip so don't worry over me, because it will make you both grow old if you do and you will get a worn look which will anoy me terribly when I back so take warning<br/>Love<br/>Rob</p>
