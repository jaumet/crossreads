<p>bags, I hope there will be some letters for me, this is the only sign of life we see when we are sent to fetch the Post bags though there is a big risk from Beachy Bill still one gets down to the sea side and can feast&nbsp;his eyes on the hustle and bustle on the war ships etc which makes one feel very home sick, I always come back with my heart full like a lump of lead, a terrible lot of our chaps are suffering from the Yellow Jaundice, dont know what the cause is some say its to&nbsp;much tinned stuff but I am inclined to think that its Climatic still they will not send you away for this complaint, I am surprised at the health I am getting considering some of our men twice my build are going under, and I have not had to attend the Dr. once, great news we hear we are the next Brigade off for a spell this of course is only a rumour but serves to cheer us all the same, we hear also that Kitchner [Kitchener] is going to call on us and see how we are progressing I hope he will give orders for a general advance I am sick of waiting and all</p>
