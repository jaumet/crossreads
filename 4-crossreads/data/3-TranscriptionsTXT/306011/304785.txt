Stayed all Wednesday at Dev. Farm Rest Camp but following day B &amp; C Sections (Tent Sub-divisions) got orders to march out at 4.30 pm to be attached dor duty to No 3 Canadian C.C.Stn. &amp; No 17 Brit C.C.S. respect., both at Remy Siding, a mile or two from Poperinghe. [Poperinge]
After a fine spell of sunny weather the rain came down before leaving &amp; the day was cold &amp; windy. After a march through rain &amp; mud for several kilometres we were glad to reach the C.C.S., which is quite a home after what we have gone through lately. We are about 16 or 17 strong &amp; have been posted to different jobs. There seems plenty of work for the C.C.S. here (2 Canadian &amp; 2 British). The 1st &amp; 2nd Aust Div hopped over on the morning of the 4th and casualties are naturally coming through in large numbers. The railway runs past the C.C.S. and Ambulance trains convey the patients to the base.
