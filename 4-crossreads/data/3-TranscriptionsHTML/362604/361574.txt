<p>Summer Hill<br/>Jurby<br/>Monday, 7/1/18</p>
<p>Dear Dad Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>I am sitting at the Fireside &amp; the snow &amp; hail lies thickly on the ground.  I thought it a fitting opportunity to write a short letter.  Marie is sitting on the sofa writing.  I sit on the mat my favourite spot.  Auntie is busy in the kitchen &amp; Uncle has not been well to-day so he stayed in bed.  I left Bulford last Wednesday &amp; arrived in London in a nice fog.  It is the first introduction I have had to a London fog but it was not a bad one.  I arrived in Liverpool at 10.45 p.m. &amp; after supper I went to stay at the Y.M.C.A.  I did not see the sense in paying 8/- for bed &amp; Breakfast as the "Angel" as previously.  Twas a bright cold morning went I boarded the "Tynwald" at 11.30 a.m.  That huge German Prize "The Vaterland" was lying at the Prince's Landing stage.  She is a monster.  She brought 11,000 Yankee Troops over on her last voyage.  She carries some nice big guns now &amp; I guess that she has a nice escort when she does travel.  I arrived in Douglas at 4 p.m. &amp; met one of our staff by the name of Quillian.  I walked along the Docks to the Railway Station &amp; caught the Train.  I eventually arrived at Sulby &amp; walked Home to Auntie's Place about 2 miles.  Everybody was out.  I had told Auntie I would catch the 8 p.m. Train &amp; instead of that I caught the 4.30 Train, it being a fine day &amp; the Boat up to time.  So I went down to the Gate Keeper's House &amp; she told me that they would all be Home soon.  She came &amp; opened up the House for me.  I lighted the fire &amp; got my tea before they all came Home.  They did get a surprise &amp; were awfully sorry that they had been out.  But of course it was my fault.  I have had a nice quiet time.  The weather has been fairly cool &amp; we have not been out anywhere at all.  I have just had tea now &amp; we will pass the evening with music &amp; chatter.  I have to be up at 5 a.m. in the morning to make a start back to Bulford.  I cannot remember many things to tell you now that Auntie has told me about the various ones in the Family.  But when we get back they will all come to my mind &amp; we will chat for Hours about things concerning our Family.  Grandma is staying with Auntie Jennie in Douglas just now.  Aunt Hannah stays with Uncle Harry.</p>
<p>Now, my Dear Dad &amp; Mother &amp; George, I will go &amp; see if Auntie &amp; Marie want any help &amp; then I'll get at the Piano.  See, Here I've had a long Holiday with your very own Sister &amp; not a word have I of news to give you.</p>
<p>So long, my Dears,<br/>Lots of Love to you all<br/>From your Harry.</p>
