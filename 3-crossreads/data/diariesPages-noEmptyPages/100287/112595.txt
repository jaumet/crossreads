The Dr condemned all our blankets this evening so they are getting new ones from Queenscliff, those on the ship were lousy in lots of cases
I believe the old Captain of our ship went raving mad when the Drs refused to let us land, he told them off a treat as they were going away in their boat our boys gave them a beautiful time called them for everything they could lay their tongues too 
the Drs to have some grounds for quarantining sent Corbett off to Portsea with a temperature of 99.2 they had him up 3 times tried 6 different testers on him, before they could get a sufficiently high enough one, this is quite true no stretching things, why if a man were to parade sick with a temperature like that in France they would almost charge him with
