 6 The signposts of civilisations are so heavy that no opportunity remains for the one in a hundred to be himself 
 To deny is one of Gods cruellest of laws 
 To promise, is one which leads all men to action The promise is for youth The denial for age Truth is but a worn-out currency which youth knows not is cancelled 
 Now dearest of women my wife I send you all the best wishes for a Xmas of cheer and good health 
 Glad you are so near to Mother and that good old Jack has cards with the best of little people in the world. Tell them there are beautiful mats here just like the magic mats of fairy tales and most wonderful lamps hanging in splendid old mosques where you have to take your shoes off before going in. I shall have time later perhaps to see and tell but at present our ears are alert  as it were for the Hun who is creeping near this railway like a poisonous centipede 
 Xmas cheer to all Love to my children Love to you dear
