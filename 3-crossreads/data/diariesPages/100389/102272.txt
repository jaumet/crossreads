4th Cold & misty. The first division are now returning to relieve us. Gee! How thankful I am. 3rd Brigade marched in today.
Fritz left us alone all day and about 8 pm our artillery opened out in a terrific "strafe" which lasted ’til the early hours of the morning.
5th Cold & wet. During the day it hailed. The ground is fast becoming slushy once more. It is hell!! And I shall be glad to get out. The P.T.T. are now smashing up 12th & 13th Bde men returning to their respective units. We are now finished our convoy duty as the whole of the division will be out by 10 am to-morrow. The Divisional Troops (Pioneers Engineers etc) will return to-morrow. I don’t think I shall return to
