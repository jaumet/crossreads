clothing our soldiers would deliberately reduce the resources of the Allies by withdrawing labour from the shearing sheds?There is no fear whatever of the adoption of such a shortsighted policy.  All War industries will receive 1st consideration as in all the allied countries.  Has Australia done enough?  Gt. Britain has sent more than 10% of her eligible men to the war & has 9% more engaged in munition making.  Australia has only sent 5% of her eligible men.  Does not the difference leave Australia plenty of room for greater efforts still?  100,000 for reinforcements would still leave Australia's efforts much short of Gt. Britain's.  Surely we cannot say that Australia has done enough, so long as she has only provided half the percentage that Britain has given!
