  
 Unfortunately I have now to move out of my cabin as the commander wishes to take possession of his own cabin under the bridge, so as to be near the bridge in case of emergency. This cabin is occupied by Lauterback, 1st leut of the reserve, who will move into my cabin for which I will be compensated by being allowed to have my meals in the officers mess. I will have to sleep either in the bureau or on the deck where there is just one hammock place free. 
 In the night we were between Shanghai and Tsingtau probably to protect "Jaguar" which was on the way from Shanghai to Tsingtau and has evidently arrived there safely. We then steer nordwards towards Korea. 
 Calm, clear weather. Nothing in particular occurs.
