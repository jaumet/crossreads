  
 it in the papers.  You won't forget to try & send about 1/2 a lb of Circular Head Potatoes for Uncle Tom to try.  My word it is lovely at Uncle's House.  I have not seen much of England or of the Isle of Man for that matter but I have had better times for all that. 
 I am glad that Mum is on the mend & trust that she will be foolish enough to relapse.  I have no news to give you so I'll ring off as I want to write to Auntie & Uncle who have just been nursed by Marie for the Flu & they are only just getting about now. 
 Best Love to you all From Harry.
