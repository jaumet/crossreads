<p>went through Picture Gallery &ndash; most of the pictures are put away Then to Kew Gardens a lonely place Spent the evening at Hampstead Bright moonlight night so there was quite a good Air Raid or rather several First thing of this sort I have seen. It was anything but terryfing all one could see were the little puffs of white smoke made by the shell bursts They certainly put up a good barrage Did not see or hear of any damage being done</p>
