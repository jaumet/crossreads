<p>11.4.16<br/>it in a very cool spot;<br/>A native put in an appearance yesterday &amp; this morning selling beer just outside the mud wall we are camped in, &amp; refused to take the hint to make himself scarce, so we rang up an Egyptian Officer at Bent-Samarag at dinner time to have him moved &amp;</p>
<p>an Egyptian guard appeared on the scene in a remarkably short time &amp; reported for duty, he is the hardest looking "doer" I have seen for some time dressed the same as all the low class of Egyptian only his dresses were more ragged than the average &amp; an old rifle swinging on his shoulder &amp; a worn out bandolier on made him look rather comic, but the beer seller did not seem to appreciate his looks &amp; he made himself before the guard got within coo-ee of him</p>
