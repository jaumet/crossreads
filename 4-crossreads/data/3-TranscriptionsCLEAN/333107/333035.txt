 There is an amusing little chap in the ward. He hails from Lancashire. Stands about 5 ft high, and is just as funny as he is short. He is away from Home for the first time in his Life and is always talking about "house and mother". 
 Carr sent down some Biscuits and Cheese and Strawberry Jam and Butter and we had quite a Banquet for Tea. 
 There are a number of malaria cases her from Salonika, and tho' "heads" seem puzzled to know what to do with 'em.
