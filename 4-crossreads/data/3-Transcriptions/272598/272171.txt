<p>a busy day.  Horse stolen from Transport; endeavouring to find culprit</p>
<p>13.4.17  Friday<br/>Fatigues again.  Plenty of sick coming through, can hardly expect anything else considering the hard work the boys have been through lately.</p>
<p>Saturday 14.3.17 [correct transcription of date]<br/>Reveille 6.15 Am.  Route march 6.45 AM. A bit of a strain considering we have only been out of the line a few days.  Few of the boys on leave to Amiens overstepped the mark &amp; were put in the "boob" by the Military Police.</p>
<p>Sunday 15.4.17<br/>Route march again before breakfast.  Leave to Amiens cut</p>
