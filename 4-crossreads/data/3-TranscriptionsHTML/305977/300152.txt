<p>written ready for the mail.  There is a bit of a swell on today.</p>
<p>Tuesday 29th  [Dec]<br/>Revielle at 4.30am so as to get stables over &amp; the mucking out done before we enter the harbour.  There is a big anchorage &amp; we find about 15 other ships there, some of them the best ships trading to Australia.  My turn as mess orderly today.  It is an easy job nothing to do between meals.  Was working in the orderly room in the morning.  Cold bleak day.</p>
<p>Wednesday 30th<br/>Had an easy day as Orderly trooper.  Several chaps including Jim Burnett were discharged &amp; went ashore.  Another cold day &amp; cloudy.  Lieut Russell who resigned last week went ashore.  It is believed he was medically unfit.  Finished duty</p>
