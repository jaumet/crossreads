Saturday 17 March 1917 [16 March 1918]1/2 day and went town, shopped, cakes, etc. for tomorrow's picnic then back to 27th & whist drive following concert 6-8 p.m.  Very enjoyable and nice men to play with.With these pts. I am quite at my ease & to know one is liked is a great help & relief from the strain of S. Piele who I fancy is almost beside herself with nerves.Raining today & of late have had a few showers & big soft clouds like our own land in rainy times.The willows are coming into leaf & all fruit trees in blossom.Spring is coming once again & in France they prepare for the big offensive - maybe the last.
