<p>heat has been most severe &amp; the flies a great pest. The glare of the sand is very trying at times for the eyes. Send all the men over here (in this delightful spot) who went on strike,  it would do them good. Last Wednesday &amp; Thursday we were greeted with a sand storm (forget the Egyptian name for it) it was absolutely rotten. Drill etc. was out of the question, sand over everything, all the utensils in the cook house were filled with it. Cooking, sand being in the food is the cause of dysentery throughout Egypt. The sand was piled up two feet high round the tent, so you can just imagine what a glorious time we are having. On Thursday evening when the storm subsided, the appearance of the country around us was changed a little.</p>

<p>19th April to 24th April 1916.<br/>Cannot keep mentioning the fact again, that this life on this desert is very monotonous,  it is no wonder we lose all interest in it at times. Same old game all the week, stretcher &amp; squad drill, &amp; route marches. Am now quite an expert in filling sand-bags &amp; then before many days have passed, suddenly find out that it has to be shifted &amp;</p>
