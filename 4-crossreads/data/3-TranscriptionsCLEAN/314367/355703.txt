  
 By Jove it has rained & torrented & gone on doing it but we're all jolly & comfortable =  There  We have no news at all - of the world - or the war - nor of our relatives - You'll have mine by now which is a comfort - (Jan 20) We've steamed out to sea - suddenly -  12 noon  probably to pick up messages from the Destroyers - Tell R. Fitz & I for days past have got up at 5.30 & rowed by ourselves to a pier - We have nothing on save a 'Lava Lava' & tie our boat up & then I jump from a spring board but Fitz falls in - often - with a horrid guttser - Fitz cant dive but I'm improving him - We are back on the ship by 6.30 & then feel jolly - Sea is 80 Air 81  F 
 Thursday Jan 21-15 -  We messed about - some - all last night - Turned round & went back & then returned - Why I don't know & also I don't care - Darken ship - Goodnight said I - Nothing further save that a small meat safe got adrift & fell -  on me  - about 2 am - no harm done - Fine morning - Cocoa - Hose bath - Sick parade 7.30 - Johnson says he dont feel like work - If he lies on his back & keeps quiet he's all right on this summer sea - So am I - but - the country is in a state of war -
