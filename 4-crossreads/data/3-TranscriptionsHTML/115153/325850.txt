<p>When we were at first out in the open ground, the Germans had their suspicions that we were there, and they kept constantly sniping and using their machine guns at random, in the hope that they would clear us away. When we had dug enough earth to shield our heads from Bullets we felt a sense of comfort and worked steadily, but if our heads peeped over the mound of earth we had already made and the German flarelights were up in the sky, they would have a few rounds at us. We had to work silently and talk in very low whispers as we were close enough to hear the Germans talking at their posts at times. We got the trench dug and had to wait until the engineers' Officer crept along and inspected it.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Germans must have felt that there was a number of us in this newly dug trench, and consequently they directed their artillery on us and made things too warm to bear; so we received orders to get out as best we could and as quickly as possible.

With the Scotties' permission we went down the stairs of the dug out to the fire, and stood in our wet clothes until we were dry; and after this I lay down on the foot of the stairway and went to sleep. Just as it was breaking day I was roused up from my sleep by one of the Scotchmen, and he directed me to the nearest and best duckboard road to take out. On reaching the duckboard track, I could see in the distance, in front and behind me, chaps that were with us the night before; before we were split up in the confusion. I</p>
