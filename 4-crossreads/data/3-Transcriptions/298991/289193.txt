<p>Tuesday July 24th<br/>The officers in camp here are all getting horses, what for no one knows, I suppose they will be alright though, until the Officers get tired of them, a new broom always sweeps clean. We are having splendid weather now. An Australian mail came in today, dated May 27th. I have only received up to April 22nd so I can look forward for some now.</p>
<p>Wednesday July 25th<br/>A lovely day. Not feeling too good. I am on <strike>issue</strike> looking after the issue of mugs, plates, &amp; Blankets, it will be a fairly easy job, if the Q.M does not put any more work on me. Shifted to No 28 hut this afternoon. I am there by myself. I have to be on the job. I will mess round at Q.M. Store.<br/>Was boarded (medically) this afternoon. There were two Captains &amp; Major Stewart on the board, result classified B.1.B. &amp; return to Weymouth, just what I wanted, it will mean a spell for a while.</p>
<p>Thursday July 26th<br/>I have a good deal of work to do now, everything spare in all huts are being shifted to my place, I am trying to get a system to work on, &amp; so far it seems to be working very well.<br/>Was paid &pound;1 today. I had more in my pay book, but I though a pound would carry me safely through to next pay.</p>
