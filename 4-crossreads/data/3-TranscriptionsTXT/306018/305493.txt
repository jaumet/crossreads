February 1918 - Marchenclosed, also letters from Doug & Ada & Edna Ferguson.  Latest letter I received was dated 12/1/18.
Friday 1st MarchUsual days work.  Had a game of billiards in the afternoon.  Stayed in the quarters after dinner & played bridge in the music room.
Saturday 2ndWent to the races at Gezira in the afternoon.  It was a beautiful day, nice & warm  & there was a good turn out.  The Sultan was present, with his bodyguard.  It was quite a spectacle seeing him arrive.  He is rather a fine looking man & seems to be very popular.  He occupied his private stand.  He had a horse racing in the 2nd race which came second.  I managed to pay all my extras with a few shillings in.
Sunday 3rdIt was quite a spring morning.  The air had a warm glow in it.  Wrote 2 letters, one to Arthur Blomfield & another to Carrie, afterwards went for a walk.  It was great in the sun.
