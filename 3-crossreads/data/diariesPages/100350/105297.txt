26 Stand to arms at 3 this morning untill daylight. Turk snipers shot several of our lads while bathing this morning. The usual artillery compliments paid by both sides. 4 New Zealanders shot down by machine gun fire while erecting barb wire defences on our left. The 4th Brigade shift our Bivouac over to "Shrapnell Gully" this evening not a very homely place as stray bullets drop around pretty frequently.
27 A lot of rifle fire indulged through the night, finishing up by our crowd being called to arms on two occasions at midnight and 3.30 this morning (No rest for the Wicked). Several of our lads returned from Hospital this morning. Turk artillery get the range to a nicety and do a great deal of damage on the beach. A bit of hurry-up going on our left this evening. Into burough early to night for a snooze.
28 To arms again at 4 this morning fireing pretty brisk all along our front, some one another false alarm. Turk Artillery drop numerous shells on the beach and into our bivouac this afternoon killing and wounding a large number of our lads some awfull sights. Got orders to get back to our old bivouac, and did so, quick and lively , but on the way a Turk shell burst among a crowd of our boys and killed 3 and wounded 12. We had a very bad day. The dead were taken down and buried in cemetry at "Hells spit" the wounded removed to dressing station.
