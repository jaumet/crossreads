  
 France 2.12.18 
 Dear Judge, I am still at the School. There is very little to do at present. The old courses have all been discontinued except one or two of the purely technical ones with which I have very little to do. There is a scheme in the air now to start a different kind of thing altogether next week. If it comes to anything we shall all be very busy again. 
 At present I spend a good deal of time playing golf and riding. The golf links are as good as anyone could wish for. The horse is in splendid condition. There are some lovely places to go riding, including a mile of good hard flat sand. Messing is good & Quarters most comfortable, so that one can manage to have a fairly pleasant time. 
 I am wondering what chance I have of going home under the "1915" arrangements. It is possible that I may be sent with an early draft of unfit men. I shall be very pleased if it does so happen. I have had just about enough of France now that the strain has eased up. I have not said anything about this to my people yet there is no use raising their hopes. Unless I am sent with one of these invalid drafts it looks as though it would be a good many months before they start to demobilize us. 
 Best Love your affectionate [indecipherable]
