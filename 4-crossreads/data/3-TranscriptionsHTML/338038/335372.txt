<p>27.7.1917<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>Got the shock of my life a day or so ago to find I was coming over on leave. I arrived here yesterday and feel sure it is going to be a decent holiday this time. London is a very different place in the Summer time and it is a pleasure to get about. I was going down to Exeter first</p>
