seen people working so hard in all my life before. Everything seemed to be just a blur. The bints are on contract work and I was told one girl was making 5/- a day and they line up early in the morning at their shed doors waiting for them to open. Judging by appearances though none of them looked over worked and all seemed very pleased with themselves. Christmas mail closes on 1st Nov. so I shall have time to write again before then I must stop now Mother. Love to Father, Hal & Fred and yourself. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson
