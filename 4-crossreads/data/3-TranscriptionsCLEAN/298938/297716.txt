  
 My latest ideas for pushing forward are two. One is to apply for a commission in the infantry & the other, to take a course with the University Correspondence College, with a view to passing the London Matric.  Have applied for particulars of the latter & am finding out about the former. The weather is colder, duller, windier & rainier than a month ago.  It is seldom we have a  sunshine  sunny day, but I like it just the same, for it is England.
