 doing very fine &amp; solid work. From the date he went up into the line, the Pad says he never saw Myrton without a smile on his face. He &amp; Fergie used to keep the show going, &amp; keep every man in good heart. They never got flurried, &amp; always smiled &amp; joked. He mentioned particularly the terrible bombardment of May 5th. Myrton had to run his show just as Fergie was doing on his left. The Pad came up next morning, &amp; he said it was a terrible sight, &amp; getting things fixed up, &amp; in the next trench Fergie was doing the same thing. The men told him that all through the bombardment they had been going up &amp; down quite coolly &amp; cheerfully, &amp; that they had put great heart into the men themselves." 
 The foregoing, I think you will agree with me, is a very fine recoed for our sons to have left behind. 
 I am Yours faithfully
