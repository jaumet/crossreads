The routine for the day was, leave camp at 9 A.M., march out about 1 1/2 mile, come into action, remain so for 25 minutes, advance another mile, halt action front, In action 1/2 hour. Advance 1 1/2 miles again, action front. The next move was a retirement, the first line wagons to go back 2 miles, take up a semi-covered position and wait for the guns to come back Whilst this move was being carried out, the guns and firing Bty wagons took up another forward position, so we now had two wagon lines The order to retire was given at guns and at once retired to first line wagons bringing along the firing Battery, Every thing went well  very few mistakes. The weather all the morning was unsettled, a few drops of rain falling when we went out. Just got into camp when down come the rain in torrents. It is now 12 oclock midday. This work is too heavy for our horses. The sand and dust is terrible
