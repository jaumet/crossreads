<p>29th  This morning when I went on I was so sorry to find that Captain Lloyd has come in as a patient &amp; am afraid its typhoid &ndash; poor boy he is finding it hard to submit to the inevitable.  He was so very keen on keeping well &ndash; He was to be a Major in a short time &ndash; fancy &amp; only 24.  Three mornings ago we saw the 1st Brigade starting on its way back to Anzac apparently cheerful &amp; brave &ndash; though at heart we all knew how they hated the thought of going back to the memories there - it made me feel terribly sad.  The reinforcements for the 4th are quarantined on account of mumps &amp; measles.  I wonder why this Island is so unhealthy &ndash; though I don't suppose it's the island so much as the flies &amp; the want of suitable food.  It's truly heart breaking when we have serious cases.</p>
<p>31st  I am wishing myself a happy Birthday.  A friend is going to post this in England for me &ndash; so farewell again you dear old things out there.  With loving Greetings for Xmas, I shall think of you all so far away XXXX.  A special Xmas X.  This is all I can send.<br/>A Donnell<br/>(PS:  I sent this [indecipherable] going from Eng &ndash; but truly I'm a bit scared of the Arrogan).</p>
