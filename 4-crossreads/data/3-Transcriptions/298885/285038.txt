<p>1915<br/>Dec. 17 to 31st</p>
<p>With a last longing look at Sydney Harbour we steamed through the heads at 3.30 p.m. on our way to what, and where, we knew not.</p>
<p>The Troopship S.S. Berrima (A35) rode the angry waves of a local squall nicely we struck just as we were a few hours out and after two days we had a very smooth run to Fremantle which we reached on 27th.  Entraining at once we arrived at Black Boy Hill Camp where we are told we will remain for 7 or 8 days during which time the boat will load wheat for England.</p>
