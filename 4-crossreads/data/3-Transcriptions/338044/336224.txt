<p>last  &amp; tomorrow we are to leave (Six of us &amp; one for Anzac Headqus). Three of the "Irish Contingent" are together. Good old times wev'e had &amp; here we are off to France again. Legge, Palliser &amp; I are in the crowd. Leave Lake who goes home &amp; I start on purchasing a few necessaries, afterwards returning to the Y.M.C.A. club in Grosvenor Gardens    &amp; have dinner. My last night in London &amp; having lost the run of the others, decide to take a walk alone, at least seeing the now familiar Strand    &amp; Hyde Park for a few hours. Enjoy the walk &amp; return to my diggings. A few Belgian soldiers are here &amp; as usual I have to act as interpreter &amp; see to all their wants after which have a long talk with one of the Belgians whose French is very distinct &amp; retire late</p>
