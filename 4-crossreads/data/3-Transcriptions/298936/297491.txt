<p>December, 1915</p>
<p>Tuesday 7</p>
<p>Still shelling.</p>
<p>Howitzer started again in the afternoon &amp; smashed a dugout near our ward.</p>
<p>I felt pretty " perspirey" laying helpless on my back.</p>
<p>Hurried orders to send walking cases to the sap, &amp; stand-by stretcher cases.</p>
<p>3 more shells &ndash; whistling slowly towards us &ndash; the terrible suspense!</p>
<p>Then they burst further away &amp; all was quiet again.</p>
<p>Egyptians mistook bomb for [indecipherable] &amp; six brought in Hospital ship.</p>
