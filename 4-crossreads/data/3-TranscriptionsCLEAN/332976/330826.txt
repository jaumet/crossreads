  
 March 1917 27th (continued)   last night, the 13th P. Coy who are on "rescue work" at the town hall, have recovered over 30 bodies of officers & men from the debris.   It is rumoured that there have been four Germans caught in Bappaume, masquerading as French soldiers, & who are aledged to be the cause of the explosions in the last few days.   One was killed in attempting to escape.   By a few days-old paper we got to-day, it is officially stated that the French are making great progress near St Quentin, & also that the Rebellion in Russia has been settled, the Tzar has been arrested, & the Grand Duke  Nicholas  Michael is in command.   No. 2 section moved off to take up there quarters in Reincourt a few miles away late to-night.
