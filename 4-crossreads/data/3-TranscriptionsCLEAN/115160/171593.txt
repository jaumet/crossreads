 This weather will do me, altho' the mud makes it unpleasant. We are able to get plenty of coal, but I have not felt the cold yet much.  We are in a pretty comfy diggings and have enough to eat. 
 The older hands (1915) are slipping away here and there, altho' one doesn't notice them going.

 Fondest love to Dad Bess & Dock, and fervid squeezes and kisses and love to yourself, 
 Your loving Son, 
 James xxxxxx.
