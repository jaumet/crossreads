  
 May, 1916 Monday 29 on the first 5.30 am Parade we start squadding & I get a class of seven officers, which is the biggest piece of luck I have had yet. 
 Tuesday 30 Am going to have an easy time this course.  All my officers have some knowledge of the gun & require very little explanation. Weather takes a turn for the heat again
