The last few day have been veri cold , and for three day now there has been frost on the ground all day long . and all the littl pool , have been cover with Ice , the road a week ago were muddi but now they are hard and dri , that is one good thing the cold doe . This is a veri quiet littl place Like near all the other villag in this local it is hidden away down in a valley , and in Summer I think it would be a rather pretti littl place , but now the tree and hedg ? are quit leafless . The farmer are busi harvest the Beet Crop and send it off to the Refineri
