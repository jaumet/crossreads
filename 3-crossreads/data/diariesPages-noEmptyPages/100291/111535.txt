Great progress still going on. Both our troops the French on the right are sweeping forward on the heels of the retreating Huns. Fritz is pillaging laying waste the evacuated territory. Villages burned sacked, wells poisoned stock driven off. Go over to Beaucourt Chateau to get Gas helmets tested. Stay in gas chamber 10 minutes. dribble. 
On return to Becordel. go into Albert. pick up a few souvenirs in shops, tea at Y.M.C.A. no sugar. Meet T. Carpenter. Secure paper, so eagerly sought after. We appreciate the old "Daily Mail".
Call on Reg. on way home for short time. Score from parcel he?d just received from Ethel Erving (Armstrong).
