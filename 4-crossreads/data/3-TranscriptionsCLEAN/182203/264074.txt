  
 covered in all different tints of green, autumn shade - with lots of Holly bushes, with berries. Oh, I simply love England - the little country lanes are delightful. Lots of gardens & Parks about even in the city - one's ideas of English children not seeing any sky nor green grass or trees is quite wrong. The children here are delightful, lovely, bonny, little pets, such rosy cheeks    & bright sparkling eyes. Had a good afternoon tea there amongst the flowers, left there & went to the City to buy a few necessities, had dinner in town & returned to Quarters about 9. p.m.   Friday , had a delightful day. Met Capt. Hay-Lawson (my beloved's pal) at 12 o'clock in London & we had a great chat. He is a charming & interesting man, quite safe, a married man, expecting his wife to come from Aust. any day
