  
 27 Sept, 1916 El Hassaniya I am having a big loafe to day, just lying in the shade of the old bivvie reading the papers brought by the last mail & smoking cigarettes.  There are several rumours afloat concerning a move for us.  Last night all surplus gear was handed in by the sergeants & all the dismounted men were packed off this morning.  Salhia was favourite last night for our destination stakes but Johno came back a few minutes ago & he says that we are going to Hill 70 then back to [Duiedah?].  There was also big talk of being equiped & trained for cavalry work. I wonder what it feels like to be swinging on to the end of a sword It came out in orders a few days ago that there was no truth in the rumour which seemed prevalent that the ALH was to move to France.  Why they should take the trouble to contradict a rumour which has stalked amongst us continually since our arrival in Egypt - now I cant for a moment imagine its one of the pleasant characteristics of our army.
