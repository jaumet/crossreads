<p>(Missing)<br/>It appeared to me that there were as many soldiers in hospital as there were in the various camps.  (From here missing.)</p>
<p>(Commence)<br/>Sunday 24.11.18<br/>The Hospital ship Wandilla arrived today from Beyrout with sick &amp; wounded.  News this day re the majority of the German high fleet having come over to Britian &amp; surrendered to the British Admiral Beaty &amp; of one destroyer German having struck a mine &amp; foundered on the way over.  Well yesterday I shall call after the words the German say &amp; said during the last 10 years or so viz. after each toast "The Day".  Well that day has come Saturday Nov. 25.11.18 &amp; may the Day be remembered &amp; honored by all the Allies for the next 100 years &amp; may all the Germans in the Allied countries be sent back to Germany after the final Peace is declared.</p>
