The game was played eleven aside and the team fielding would station four men each side of the matting, just in front of the three marks, one behind the wicket, one on point and then of course would be a bowler, the batsmen would endeavour to hit the ball past the fieldsmen.

The former is played briefly as follows, the two competitors sit on a long circular pole (one of the booms of the ship) about five feet above the flooring, immediately underneath where they sit are all kinds of mattresses etc. laid down so that if one gets knocked off he would have something soft to fall on. Both men have pillows filled with "kapok" with which they batter at one another until one of them looses his balance and falls over. The final was between an A.S.C. representative and one of another unit and after a real good battle the
