<p>18th Heavy thunderstorm which soon passed. Nothing doing.<br/>19th Air raid at about 5am Fritz dropped bombs in field nearly doing no damage.<br/> I've a paper which arrived yesterday's mail. I read a statement by Billy Hughes at Bridgewater Victoria to the effect the Australians had been withdrawn from the line for three months owing to lack of reinforcements. This is a lie- The Australians have never yet been away from the forward area. In fact they have been in all the heaviest fighting. Since the offensive began in 1916 Colonial troops have taken the brunt of it all along the line.</p>
