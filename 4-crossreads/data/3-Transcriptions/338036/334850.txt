<p>December<br/>Friday 1st<br/>Baths still closed.  Was on sanitary work of Baths yesterday &amp; today.  Received a bumper mail today (I received no less than 18)  In our billet there are 3 pairs of German top boots probably Ulans left when they evacuated this town.  At 6 pm Major Honman lectured us on our several duties for tomorrow and I was a Lance Corp. in charge of sanitation. Some job.<br/>It might be stated that Armentieres is practically surrounded by Germans and a sudden advance by them would cut us off.<br/>Picking up the French lingo by degrees</p>
<p>ARMENTIERES<br/>Saturday 2nd<br/>Baths going again.  Put thro' about 600 today.</p>
<p>Sunday 3rd<br/>Received about 17 letters Australian mail,  Also the proceeds of my cable, &pound;4-7-10<br/>This afternoon with Jack Driver to Armentieres and saw our Dressing Station &amp; Hospital.  Beautiful &amp; up to date town was my impression of Armentieres.  the red brick with white facings being particularly pretty.  A large Cathedral had been badly damaged.  Received parcel from Harold Baldock.  Got used to seeing the word Estaminet (tavern)</p>
