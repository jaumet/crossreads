<p>It is very difficult for me to be business like just now, especially as my hut is the hottest stuffiest hut in one of the hottest places on the earth and the sweat is simply streaming out of one &ndash; but I know you appreciate being told where you are &amp; "as long as you know &amp;c."</p>
<p>Now let me state calmly that it will be a bit of a job for me to travel from Egypt to England <u>but</u> there is every indication of a still further improvement in my health.  I may have to break journey &amp; rest at either Marseilles or Paris but that doesn't concern you and in fact <strike>it</strike> this paragraph is only to give weight to the following.</p>
