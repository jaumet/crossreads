Dear Mother,
Arrived out here O.K. about 4 pm today and am attached to 9th Rein 2nd Batt, under Noel. I do not know if I shall be able to get the week end off yet but am going to have a yarn with him tonight.
It is fearfully dusty out here, nearly as bad as Egypt. Am amongst rather a decent lot of fellows and should get on pretty well. Do not know exactly when we shall get away, but I do not think on Monday - probably Wednesday.
Got the camera today, and it a beauty, with any luck I should be able to get some photos worth having. Saw Niven also today and had a talk with him. I will say Good day now as I am going to see Noel about the week end.
Love to all
Alan
