<p>Sunday 5 September, 1915</p>
<p>One man killed in trenches. It is now getting very cold at night. A&nbsp;foretaste of what we may expect later on.</p>
<p>The usual bombardment by the enemy. We are&nbsp;getting quite used to this now &amp; take no notice.</p>
<p>Am well again today.</p>
<p>Roast meat for dinner a rare treat, makes you think you are back at home.</p>
