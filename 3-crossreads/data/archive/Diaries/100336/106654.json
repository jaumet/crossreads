The battleship, Ocean, lay at the Suez entrance of the canal and the Swiftsure at the Port Said entrance.  Between these ships at intervals were the cruisers Minerva, Clio, a French cruiser and the armed liner Himalaya.  The reason for these ships being stationed there was an anticipated attack on the canal by the Turks.  All alone the canal on both sides trenches were dug, these trenches were occupied by Indian, Territorial and Australian troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While passing through the canal we had to have our bridge barricaded to protect the officers from Turkish Snipers on the desert for we learn that the Turkish forces are only a few hundred yards over the desert.  We arrive Port Said 18th January.  Here we receive orders to proceed to Ten<strike>r</strike>edos at the mouth of the Dardanelles to take up patrol duties.  On this trip we strike a heavy head sea all the way.  Arrive Tenedos February 5th 1915.

AE11 takes patrol every other day, working with the B class of submarines which are also stationed there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our depot ship at this port is the Hindu Kush formerly the merchant ship Hindustan.  About the middle of February we shift our base from Tenedos to Lemnos, a small Greek Island 40 miles west of <strike>Tenedos</strike> the mouth of the Dardanelles.
