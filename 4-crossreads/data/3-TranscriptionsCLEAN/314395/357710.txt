  
 England 17.8.18 
 Dear Dad Two letters from you tonight, 20th and 27th May, 3 months on the journey.  They both contain enquiries about Ireland and Scotland, which I regret very much to say I am unable to answer.  I was forced to forego my proposed visit to those places, as, so far I have been only able to accept periods of 4 days, and have had to refuse the 10 days trench leave, to which I was entitled.  The reason of course you know.  I have told you before that when I go on leave, I live well.  I like to forget the army for a while, and live decently.  That means about 15/- per day for a start, and with the incidental exes reaches about 1.  It is absolutely useless going any distance without at least 2-10 per day in your pocket.  So in spite of the assistance you have given me, I have not reached either Ireland or Scotland.  I have been a few times to London and seen quite a lot of interesting things there, and enjoyed myself well.  I could not take the 10 days how-
