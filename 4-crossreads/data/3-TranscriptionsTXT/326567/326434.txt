a small pine Forrest, on resuming our March we came to the end of the road & on to the Cliffs which were very high & commands a splendid view of the Sea. An old wreck was lying some distance out & judging by the Colour of the hold, it looked like a Hospital Ship. After retracing our steps some distance back we turned up another Road & passed the Royal Garrison Artillery Camp which contained a great number of Guns, Limbers & Mules, this Camp is a very large one alongside of the This Camp the Train line was running & we followed it up hill & eventually arrived back at our Camp at 4 Pm when we were dismissed for the Night. Thursday 17/5/17No Parade in the Morning so I spent some time down at one end of the Camp chatting to a Belgian Soldier behind the Wire Fence in a Belgian Hospital for Convalescent Soldiers, as he could speak fairly good English we made ourselves understood, there were several men with one arm & one Leg & looking very haggard which no doubt showed the rough time they had been through. After Dinner we packed up our Kits at 4 Pm & had Tea at 5 Pm &
