are taking possession of the paddocks Just down close to our Hqrs there is a peculiar sight a big German shell sticking in a tree a good  of it is hanging out it must have been nearly spent otherwise it would have gone right through the wood. We were caught nicely this afternoon in the trenches for the Germans started to shell heavily the very exact place we were working in things were far from pleasant for some considerable time, a couple of men were killed a few wounded some big dugouts were blown right in, our guns replied to their fire things were what you would call mixed for a while.
There were some Staff officers through here at the time having a look round our Colonel (now Acting Brigadier)
