<p>20 Oct, 1916<br/>Sidi Bishr<br/>We are fixed up at the rest camp here, it seems a good place.  What a weary trip it was down here &ndash; We left camp yesterday morning at about six &amp; we got here at 5 in the evening.  Right along the line the sight was one of green fields &amp; water &amp; perhaps one would have enjoyed it more had the seating accomadation been better but we were cramped up uncomfortably on the hard seats in dirty carriages &amp; it was not until we got near Sidi Gaber that the boys showed any enthusiasm in their surroundings &ndash; Along here every thing looked to be greener &amp; in greater profusion.  Banana plantations palm maize, etc every where</p>
<p>The Nile is swollen with the flood &ndash; I heard some one remark that the waters had reached a higher point than since the year 1889 so its some flood &amp; a muddy swirling old stream it was, the glimpse I had of part of it.  We had orders read to us, they were lengthy &amp; some caused some rude remarks &amp; a deal of snickering from the Aussies &ndash; While the Tommies looked at us like so many Mother Grundy's.  Here is a sample --- "When going to bed at night the rifle bolt must be removed &amp; the sling loosened one end &amp; tied either to the arm or leg"  The limit</p>
