 WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27, 1919. 
 Cold with SW gale blowing. 
 Cut out the wethers after breakfast 
 &amp; took them down to Middle. They 
 wont start on ewes till Friday 
 morning so I turned them out 
 in Point. Tickle lopped in 
 4D for cattle &amp; later we shifted 
 cattle into Middle &amp; lopped 
 for them there. 
 Linda, My&eacute;e &amp; Hilda were 
 down burning off.
