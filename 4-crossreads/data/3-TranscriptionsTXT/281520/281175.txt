"B" Camp Mametz29/3/17A cold wintry day.  Men all cleaned up and turned out smart on parade.  At 10 am conference of O.C. Corp re yet another method of attack formations and spent most of the morning going through it.  Fine breakfast in our officers mess.  These huts are very comfortable and we are just settled down nicely when orders arrive that we must move to "D" Camp tomorrow.  Padre has gone in to Albert to buy canteen goods  Stewart is to bring our band instruments back from London when he returns.
After lunch took a summary of evidence and Dr Sanbrook arrived in a heavy rainstorm.  Sent for horse and with him and Dr Craig rode [indecipherable] to Vivier Mill for a bath.  An excellent canteen here but it and the village of Meaulte were deserted owing to the forward movement of all arms.  Roads that were previously crowded are now deserted.  The ground between Meaulte and Becordel is nothing like as badly scarred as it is further on.  A quiet evening.  Pedler in to mess.  French studies proceeding slowly.
