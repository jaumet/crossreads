<p>as his father was so devoted to him and so full of plans for his future.</p>
<p>It is so difficult to realise even now, that it is all ended and that he can never come back to us. It seems such a cruel end to much ambition &amp; keenness and just when he got the chance he longed for, to "really do something."</p>
<p>I am remaining in India until the war is over, I was ready to be off at a moments notice, but as my people are out here on a visit, I shall wait to go home with them. Poor [Normand McLaurin?], I was very sorry to hear about him, we got to know him so well and I think he was the nicest man I know &amp; such a good soldier.</p>
<p>You will be having an anxious time about your boy but I hope he will get through safely.</p>
<p>With kindest regards &amp; please tell Mr. Ferguson how greatly we appreciated his letter. We shall meet you at home sometime I hope c/o Knight. 9 Pall Mall. London- will always find me.</p>
<p>Sincerely yrs<br/>[Emily Irvine?]</p>
