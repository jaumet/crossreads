<p>21 March Tues<br/>Attended sick parade 6.45 am. Ken &amp; I are in the dispensary to-day &amp; have some fun diagnosing the different cases finally finishing up with No 9's. Boat drill again today &amp; also a big bath going &amp; Orders say everyone is compelled to have a bath. Sea getting rough.</p>
<p>22 March 1916 Wed<br/>A very quiet day in fact after I had done the dressings I turned in for the day. At night saw Ronnie &amp; he procured me a couple of bottles of whisky &amp; Bell, Sid Bragg &amp; Arthur Preston polished them off in the orderley room. Passed Toulon about 8 pm. Arrived off Marseilles not long after. As I was just dozing off to sleep I could hear the anchor.</p>
