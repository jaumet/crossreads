They burst on roadway uncomfortably near & when I arose to push on  without delay you could have heard my knees shaking although outwardly we were jolly & laughing over our narrow escape.  Fritz shelled that road several times during that night & next day but we werent that close.  I have had stomach complaint for a couple of days (probably the chlorinated water) and felt very weak.
