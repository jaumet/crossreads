  
 Walker's Ridge - Pope's Hill - Quinn's Post 
 glad to venture on our next experience which was visibly seen on account of the great number of newly arrived British troops who were being harboured from view of the aeroplanes amongst the hilly mountains which were cut away by us into a series of ledges for their accommodation. 
 It proved true.  We were in conjunction with the New Zealanders to constitute the main attacking force for the supremacy of the Sari Bair mountains to which we were to approach from the direction of Suvla Bay. 
 
 At midnight, we landed at Anzac Beach And while resting during the night, We dreamed of victory within reach, Of prospects and visions bright, At dawn  they  we climbed the mountains steep And were making for Walker's Ridge Where many of us would soon sleep After crossing eternity's bridge. But others with an iron will Kept on climbing Gallipolis's crests, And hundreds fell fighting at  Quinn's  Post Pope's Hill While others died game at Quinn's Post.
