<p>The magical order came "Stand to your horses"! "Get out!" "Scatter!" Away we go out of the plain O'Halloran and I share the same "possie" ie hole in the ground &ndash; safe position &ndash; bomb-proof shelter. Anything you like to call it but known here popularly as a "possie".<br/>Two Taubes came over head and when they got close enough the machine guns started rattling at them and greatly to our surprise proper anti-aircraft guns; sent shell after shell in the air after them the first couple of shots going perilously close. I made sure the Taube <u>was</u> hit several times; it seemed so from my position. He came down lower and we thought that he had been "winged" but he daringly came down lower the better to see where he could drop his bombs, presently he let them go and they went whistling down thousands of feet and crashed with a fearful detonation. The other fellow flew over our position and dropped 4 bombs close to our camp killing 3 horses and slightly wounding one man. One bomb did not explode. Then they cleared out with our planes on their heels seeing them off the premises as it were. Later Our machines</p>
