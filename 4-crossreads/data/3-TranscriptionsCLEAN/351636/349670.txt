Dear Mr. Layton -Do you think you could give Mrs. Hilder some help today? She has been to you before & so feels shy about troubling you again. She seems badly in need of assistance. her children have no clothes & not enough to eat.
I am going to make inquiries about the separation allowance from Liverpool
