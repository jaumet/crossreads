<p>However about 10 pm the party with the "iron" rations, to be carried in the action, arrived, &amp; the tins of bully beef in this instance, one (1) tin to three men, &amp; to each man 4 biscuits, &amp; a fair sized piece of cheese were served out. Special emphasis was placed on the "order" that the men were not to eat the rations, they were to be treated as "emergency" for nothing more could be guaranteed (for certain) for the next four days.</p>
<p>A good hot stew was served immediately afterwards &amp; as luck would have it, the rum ration, due that day, much to every mans pleasant surprise "came through" without "damage" or "accident" &amp; although this rum ration was only two table spoonsful it was certainly appreciated on such a cold night.</p>

<p>He explained that when going for water for the Cooks he had noticed a fatigue party carrying up whisky to the Officers canteen, &amp; for the last hour he had been thinking out a plan how he could get some for the section. Now!, he said, I have my plan all ready &amp; I'm off!</p>
<p>After being absent about twenty minutes he hurriedly returned &amp; from under his tunic he disclosed a lovely bottle of good old "Scotch", "the real Mackay". It looked almost unreal. Where did you get it? Is there any more? How much did you pay for it? How did you pinch it?</p>
<p>Come on! he said No questions answered till after we enjoy it! Come on! Out with</p>
