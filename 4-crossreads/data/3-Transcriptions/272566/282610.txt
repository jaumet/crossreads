<p>Very warm - Quite a record for France &ndash; That wet heat.<br/>By mid-day our unit had been relieved by the 5th F. Amb. and the last of our men had left <strike>by</strike>.  I rode the new Douglas motor cycle.<br/>Our new camp is on a hill overlooking Senlis &amp; the country is very picturesque.  The hillsides are a mass of colours due to the wild flowers.<br/>This little village is quite intact &ndash; untouched by shell fire or the any other signs of warfare</p>
