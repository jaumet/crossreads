<p>We haven&#39;t been killing ourselves today. We are further advanced than any of the other pits so are taking it easy.</p>
<p>We are being well fed lately &amp; have plenty of water. We have no&nbsp;occassion to grumble &amp; yet we do. It is a soldiers privelige. Personally I don&#39;t mind it out here now, only that I am anxious to get home again &amp; I don&#39;t suppose I shall be actually[?] happy till I get there.</p>
