You at your age will feel the coldIt's trying too, when you are old,To have your movements all controlledBy Tom or DickAnd have to do just what you're told,And do it quick.
In summer you will find the heatTerrific &ndash; when with blistered feetAnd choked with dust, and all but beatYou have to marchIn shifting sand &ndash; not Regent StreetOr Marble Arch.The flies too are a perfect pestThat all your food &amp; drink infest.You swallow Johnny Walker's bestTo cool your throttle &ndash;And feel a buzzing in your chest &ndash;A d-d blue bottle.
