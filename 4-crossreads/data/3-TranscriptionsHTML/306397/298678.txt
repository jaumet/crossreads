<p>29th Nov 1914<br/>In the evening we sit comfortably in our corners listening to strange stories by Mr Gumdlach.<br/>Object :- <u>Africa</u></p>
<p>30th Nov 1914<br/>Information of the capture of 2 german Army Corps is denied by the Russian General Staff</p>
<p>1st Dec 1914<br/>Today I remembered that 29th Nov was my birthday. Papers bring no news.</p>
<p>2nd Dec 1914<br/>Nothing to note</p>
<p>3rd Dec 1914<br/>The rumour is about that the Italian firms here have been warned that, within a few days Italy will be forced to fight with Germany against England. Germany  has promised Italy, Savoy and Malta, Austria - the former Italian territory . We all hold the opinion that if Italy joins us, against the Allies, the war will soon be over. An interesting article by a pro German American appears in the "Straits-Times of 2/12/14. It will clearly be seen from this article that Germany will be on top in this war. The last few evenings we sit outside and play cards. Unfortunately I have been practically forced to learn to play "Staat" in spite of papa's prohibition. It is not so bad as we are not gambling.</p>
<p>4th December 1914<br/>Mr Briertz moves into camp W4. We drink to him.</p>
<p>5th Dec 1914]<br/>Nothing important</p>
