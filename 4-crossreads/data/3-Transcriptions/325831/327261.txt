<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>I am very well &amp; in good fit condition. The mud is everywhere &amp; in everything. The cold weather has left us for the present but as a matter of fact we would all prefer the frost &amp; ice to the mud. I am again temporarily commanding the Battalion the Colonel being away on leave. This means that I shall take the Battalion into the line next tour of duty there. I am enjoying the position immensely (at present).</p>
<p>I heard today that Keith has dropped into a good staff job. How I hope that it is true. I hope to find out definitely tomorrow. There is no news. Everything is going well.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Yours affectionately</p>
