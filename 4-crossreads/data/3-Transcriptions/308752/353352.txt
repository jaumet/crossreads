<p>in a couple of wounded I believe they are to be mentioned for their bravery. Every man who was in Gallipoli said that it was only a picnic when compared with this fighting. In the afternoon we all enjoyed a well earned res, but unfortunately at 4 p.m. we had to shift from our billets &amp; make for bomb proof dug-outs. The enemy started looking for our battery, a few shells landed in the garden surrounding our billet. We look upon it as a great joke when Fritz starts sending a few souvenirs over. A soldier walking along the street was caught by a piece of shrapnel, &amp; brought into us to be attended to. At 8 o'clock 8 men were called up to proceed to the trenches. I was included in this party, we were taken to our destination in a motor ambulance. A different direction to where we had been previous. Buildings  passed all the way along the road were a mass of ruins. We had a walk of two miles along a sap which was a great improvement to the ones we had been in yesterday, they were much wider &amp; had a good strong floor. Spent the night in a dug-out, very comfortable &amp; plenty of blankets. The latter we found next day, very chatty. Just before turning in I had to go with two others &amp; obtain some stretchers &amp; place them at the mouth of the Sap on the main road. The distance was about 2 miles, snipers were at work &amp; we had to move pretty brisk. On arriving back at our dug-out I was taking off my putties at the door when something dropped just in front of me. On being informed that it was a bullet it did not take me long to get inside the dug-out, I believe that this is the 5th time that an attack has been made by the Allies but the Germans are too strongly entrenched. Our companies in the dug-out are New Zealanders &amp; British Tommies &amp; they are very decent chaps. The former happened to be in camp at Moassea (Egypt) when we arrived there after that terrible route march. But of course that march is nothing when compared with the last couple of days. A good drink of rum soon puts a fellow right as I found out. I have been most anxious to be in action for the last six months but never again. Good God I hope I do not</p>
