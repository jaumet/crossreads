one, (they sold them down-stairs) old Jim started to walk up ask a dummy girl figure which was seated at a desk with some in front of her, when I grabbed him by the Back of the coat pulled him back. Gee! I did laugh at him. Had tea went to a play called ?Bubbly? just off Trafalgar Square a bit, very good. Got lost coming back as its fairly dark. Ran across Charing Cross (Under.) took the tube to Westminster then we were right.
