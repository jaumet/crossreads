9th Oct:- Rough weather again but not so bad as before. Not seasick this time. No land in sight  &  we are glad that we are well on the way to Egypt. May we soon reach there.
10th Oct:- Sunday
Still rough  &  windy. The ship rolling a lot. A concert was to have been held to-night, but was postponed owing to the weather
11th Oct:- Sunday.  A little calmer &  getting warmer  Work as usual. The water has been very bad. Half salt  &  hardly drinkable. The tea  &  coffee is awful. Water better to-day. Plum pudding for dinner heavier than lead. Two strong men had a piece on a string  &  managed to drag it round the deck.
