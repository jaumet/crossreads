<p>Bulford<br/>24.2.18<br/>Dear George,<br/>I have no news I'm only sending a P.C. to let you know that we are O.K. I went to a Dance dinner this week in the camp it was jolly-oh. The W.A.A. C.'S gave it to the Australians. We are giving them a return blow night on the 11th inst. I hope. I went to Sarum by train yesterday but I returned at 7 P.M. I met George Greer who used to have the shop next door to Buntings &amp; also Flossie Gibbons both of whom I played Soldiers with in the old &amp; Company O.M.R.R. It has been showery today but I went out for a nice walk alone &amp; watched the Tommies at Soccer. We have had lovely mild weather. All the trees are in bud &amp; snowdrops &amp; all early spring flowers are blooming beautifully. I have 17 letters to write to-night so I must get on George. Regards to all the Boys &amp; especially Os. Merrett &amp; Mr Love &amp; Give Kind Regards to all the Miles Family &amp; Lily &amp; Ken &amp; Mum. Your Loving Brother  Harry</p>
