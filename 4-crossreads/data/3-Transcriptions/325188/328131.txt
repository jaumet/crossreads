<p>Gallipoli Peninsular<br/>July 8 1915</p>
<p>All the boys send their love &amp; good wishes</p>
<p>Dear Weir<br/>By last post I received your parcel of writing paper &amp; envelopes &amp; immediately distributed them amongst the different squadrons they were quickly swallowed up. Everybody was on beam &ndash; ends for such material &amp; it was most welcome. We have sent a couple of lads over to Lemnos for a few days to try &amp; get some further supplies &amp; a few luxuries such as jam &amp; pickles as well.<br/>We have been doing purely garrison work ever since we landed not having made any attempt at our part of the line to advance at all. Of course we are only a very short way from the Turkish trenches &amp; to do any good would mean a general advance This seems to be hung up waiting on the southern forces but their progress is exceedingly slow &amp; very heavy losses have been inflicted on both sides. Our men are keeping only fairly well a good deal of dysentery etc due a good deal to the inactivity. When out of the firing line they get a chance of a swim</p>
