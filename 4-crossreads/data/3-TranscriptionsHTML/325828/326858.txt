<p>My dearest Father,<br/>At last there is something definite about our going I rumaged round this afternoon, &amp; found that I have been allocated to the 12th Reinforcements of 1st Field Ambulance to sail on or about the 10th of next month.  Three of my tent mates are off with the 11th Reinforcements by the "Argylshire" on the 26th inst. &amp; the 12th are sailing about a fortnight later which will bring it to the 10th prox.  Nothing through yet about final leave but don't expect to have any trouble with it<br/>Am trying to arrange to come down one day next week, but will let you know what day it will be.</p>
<p>We have been having very dirty weather here - terribly windy (S.W to W.) &amp; clouds of dust &amp; sand.<br/>Very busy with measles now- 127 cases.</p>
<p>Must close now with love to all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>J Leo L Waterhouse.</p>
