<p>26.10.15<br/>Tue 26th<br/>The Signallers of the old 12th now D.Sqd have been working to have us hoisted out of  F R A dug-out; they have also had Major Chambers on battling for them but so far with no success: A small steamer has been run ashore  down at the beach near us &amp; they have been busy to-day taking her cargo off, it is rumored she is a captured vessel; One of the Turkish guns gave one of our mine sweepers an uncomfortable ten minutes this morning, they picked up the range in quick time &amp; soon were dropping shells very close, the last lot fired before the boat commenced to move appeared to fall only a few feet short of the water line, but she soon moved out of danger</p>
