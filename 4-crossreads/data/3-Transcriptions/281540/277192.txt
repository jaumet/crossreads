<p>The vegetation of Turkey in poor country of this nature appears to be of just a few species.  The rhododendron and a small prickly bush (holly) seem to be the principal and cover these sandy hillsides.  Nowhere is a greater height than about 4' 6" attained  Dwarf oak trees about 2' 6" high are come across now and again and sage and thyme grow wild among the undergrowth.  Wild olive bushes are also intermingled with the other undergrowth.  An examination of the country in front of us (looking across to the Turks trenches) through the limited reflection of a periscope shows pleasant country side open and green cultivated in parts &amp; with an occasional white house or village.</p>

Looking inland towards the other flank is a range of hills with similar land about.  A shallow salt lake extends inland some distance from Suvla Bay.  Where we are situated beggars description one can only say that we are perched on a hillside and chasms &amp; ravines lie below. Rugged country like a huge river basin [indecipherable].</p>
<p>Bird life is scarce.  Only an occasional one is seen.  Insects are limited to [indecipherable] flies and some ants.  Centipedes flourish</p>
