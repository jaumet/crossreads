 Picture post card in black and white of "Salisbury Cathedral" 
 Poem on Card: "As many days in one year there be, So many windows in this church we see, As many marble pillars here appear (8760), As there are hours throughout the fleeting year, As many gates as moons one year does view, Strange tale to tell, yet not more strange than true."
