  
 It has been snowing all day to day   &   there is a covering of about 4 or 5 inches.  Lots of the Boys were snowballing   &   had great fun.  There are Huge snow-balls   &   snow men built everywhere.  It is such a pretty sight   &   is quite warm.  But when she starts to melt lor, the muck   &   isn't it cold too. I'll put on my Rubber Top Boots to-morrow Harry
