9Well, dear Parents, I will have to cut this letter off as the mail boat is expected alongside any moment now.I expect this letter will be delayed here for a fortnight or so in which case it should reach you just about Christmas. How I would love to be home just for that day, but I will be thinking of you and now wish you & Pat a very merry Xmas & all happiness and prosperity for the coming year.Fondest love fromYour affectate sonTerence.
