<p>I was marked out for furlough today so next week I will be back at Bristol bet your life, to stay with the Holman's.  I only get a fortnight sad to say so in 6 weeks time I will be well back at the front.</p>
<p>Dec. 29th<br/>I have been about a week on furlough now, I spent 3 days in London went to 3 or 4 Theaters and had a lovely time.  I am now at Bristol staying with the Holmans and am having the best time I ever had in my life.  Pte. Hamilton, V.C., is staying here.  I haven't time to write any more now as I to play a game of billiards with Eileen Holman.</p>
