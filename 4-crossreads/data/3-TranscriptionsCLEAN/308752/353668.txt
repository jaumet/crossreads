  
 half an hour after dinner, & a race was held in one of the main streets. These Rickshaws are to be seen everywhere, big perambulators pulled from the front, by natives, who will run with you from one end of the city to the other, for a few pence. Numerous shops were visited during the afternoon, and a few souvenirs of Colombo were purchased. There is certainly a charm walking in and out of the different shops, argueing with the shopkeepers, and being almost surrounded at times in the streets by native children begging for money. An hour was spent at the Y.M.C.A. & at 4 p.m. we made our way, down to the jetty. A pulling boat was hired, & on our way to the China we paid a visit to a Submarine, which was manned by Australian Sailors.

We are expected to arrive at Fremantle on Sunday the 1st June, and I believe that leave is to be granted to go ashore, after the West Australians have disembarked. 
 1st June 1919. The arrival in Australia. 
 The above date will be an ever memorable one to me, the day I arrived at Australian shores. As dawn was breaking, the shores of the "Land of Sunshine & Wattle" (to us the only place worth living in) was sighted. Shortly after breakfast the health authorities
