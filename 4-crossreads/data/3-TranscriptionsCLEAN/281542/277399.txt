The weather has now taken on its winter coat.  Rain storms are frequent & the wind blows damp & bleak.  Grim angry clouds scud low overhead and threaten to deluge us throughout the day.  The passage of wild fowl has begun, & flocks of all variety of game - geese, cranes, wild duck, quail & pigeons - pass over, squeaking & squawking to one another as they battle against the fury of the elements.  The swallows have swarmed days ago, & left us for warmer climes, (on this see extract from Westminster Gazette ...)

"The latter are invariably in some Chateau or country residence" he remarked, "6 or 7 miles back from the firing line, & if a Staff Officer wants to take his breakfast across the road he calls his motor car, so to speak.  A Staff Officer is very seldom seen in the firing line" he concluded.
Wintry conditions now prevail - a high wind howled throughout the night & this morning blew with tempestuous force from all quarters.  A strong wind here plays the devil with our bivouacs dugouts, especially those of primitive build.  The nature of the country favours an adverse wind, so alternated is it with gullies, narrow-gutted defiles & passes, there is little protection from
