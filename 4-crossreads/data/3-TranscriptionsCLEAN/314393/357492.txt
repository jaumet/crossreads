& myself off my post in the big German dug out which we had used during the day last time we were in that position so decided to take my men down into the village of Geudacourt which was only about two hundred yards on our right. On arriving in the village I discovered an old cellar which had been made into a dug out which I afterwards learned was an old German Headquarters having been heavily mined by the Huns before they had left it, but it proved a good place for a sleep which we enjoyed. After being a sleep for a few hours I was suddenly awakened by the Company Sergeant-Major who told me to pack up al my gear & report to company headquarters at once. This did mot take me long & on reporting to headquarters was informed that I was being sent to a school of instruction for N.C.O.'s which sounded like music in my ears for it meant getting well away from the mud for a few days at least. On leaving company headquarters I was accompanied by an officer & a corporal with instructions to report to battalion headquarters as soon as possible. our first part of the journey was across open country under full observation by Fritz who fired a few shots some of them falling uncomfortably short but luck favoured us & we managed to get to battalion headquarters intact. We remained her until 2 PM when we were joined by two N.C.Os & 1 officer from each company then set out for the battalion transport lines which were at Montauban arriving there about dusk after a long walk. That night I enjoyed a real good rest also two good meal which I obtained from a mate who was in the Army Service Corps & camp close by the battalion transport. Next morning the 29th we left the transport making our way towards Albert & after walking about a mile managed to catch a motor lorry which took us right to a camp in Albert where we stayed for a couple of days. The camp here consisted of tents being very comfortable
