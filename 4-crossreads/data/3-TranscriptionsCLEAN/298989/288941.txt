7/1/16name I cannot remember & he said Curnow was nearly well and others.
Returned per gharry to the ship and had tea. The 19th. Battalion were entraining and in fairly heavy rain the 21st. disembarked at 1900. We commenced to leave the ship at 2045 and got 500 men off by single gang way only taking one man at a time by within 40 minutes. Each third class carriage here holds 48 men so we told them off into 48's. Getting into the carriages takes time with only two doors and cumbrous packs. About 10 men "imshied" and will be dealt with later. Some well tanked having been down in the crews quarters and had to be carried on to the train.
All got aboard at 2145 and after a last look at the Ascanius we steamed off at 2215 for Tel-el-Kebir. A chilly night Alexandria is full of soldiers mostly British, such Australians as are there look smart having new tunics, hats &c. The railway carriages are good and lighted by electricity, over each seat are globes for reading purposes and photographs of the country are let in above the seats. The driver is a coal black negro and the fireman a nigger to but seem to know their job. There is not  much wrong with the Egyptian state railways. Curled up on half a seat and went to sleep.
