<p>Thur. May 10 (cont)<br/>We arrived at the R.A.P [Regimental Aid Post] in the sunken road about 8 p.m. &amp; reported to Major Bond.  Two squads failed to turn up &amp; we waited for them an hour or so before moving on to relieve the others.  Our Squad, (Bricky, Howard, Johnnie Maggs &amp; Nigger Bowden &amp; I) went out to Left R.A.P. with 3 other squads &amp; relieved the 1st F. Amb.  We had a good dug out which held 2 squads nicely.  Reg Sutton, Arthur Butler, Sam Wallace &amp; Wynn Arthur were the other squad. <br/>Things were fairly quiet &amp; we didn't get a case till about 2 a.m. on</p>
<p>Friday May 11th   <br/>Just as we were about to start off with our case Fritz put over his Barrage &amp; the M.O. of the 59th told us to wait awhile till he slowed down a bit.  About 2.30 we started off.  Fritz continued to shell heavily, but we were lucky &amp; got through to the relay Post without damage.  Fritz kept on putting his big stuff over &amp; the cases arrived just quick enough to keep us on the move.  Harry Lambdon got a crack on the hand just before we arrived at the R.A.P. which  made his squad short.  Dick Scholer, Dick Kenna, &amp; Armstrong were the other 3.  About 10 or 11 a.m. Fritz dropped a shell just outside our dug-out &amp; gave Scholer a crack on the Head.  He went away smiling.  That left his squad with 2.  Then Dick Kenna took sick &amp; that left one.  <br/>The 58 Batt. were in the front Line &amp; they got it hot &amp; strong.  There are thousands of dead lying about &amp; the stench is awful.  During the afternoon 2 men got killed in the sap through which we return from the relay Post.  It is not wide enough to allow a stretcher through</p>
