<p>III<br/>Many thanks Father for the statement of funds &ndash; The only thing I want to be sure of is that you both have plenty to make you comfortable &amp; I hope that you will not hesitate to draw on me should the necessity arise &ndash;<br/>By the way the &pound;50 cabled me arrived safely &amp; is in my credit with the Commonwealth Bank London.  I did not need it this time but I don't like to be without a "nest egg" in case I get landed in England for a long time &ndash;<br/>Must rush over to the station now to enquire about trains.<br/>With fondest love to yourselves &amp; Pat<br/>I am your loving Son<br/>Terence<br/>PS  Enclosed snap taken at the school</p>
