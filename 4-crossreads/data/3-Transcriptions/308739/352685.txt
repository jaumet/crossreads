<p>Sunday 2 April 1916<br/>Went for a long tram ride to Heliopolis &amp;amp; around Cairo before proceeding by train at 11 a.m. for Serapeum.<br/>The large Hospital at Heliopolis is now deserted, &amp;amp; every thing looks as through the Soldiers are fading away.<br/>Col. Fuller who went on the previous day to Salhia to inspect Camp with Major Foster returned at 2 a.m. this morning.<br/>I arrived back to Camp at 3-3 p.m.</p>
<p>Monday 3 April 1916<br/>Orders came to hand today to be in readiness to leave Serapeum tomorrow at noon for another spot on Canal towards Port Said.<br/>The Brigade has to ride through whilst Baggage &amp;amp; Waggons, etc. go by train.<br/>Our Limber Carts go with us &amp;amp; will take the Col. valise, etc.<br/>We understand that the Artillery is to occupy this Camp.<br/>We notice many Troops moving from different spots, &amp;amp; the lines at times are severely taxed.</p>
<p>Tuesday 4 April 1916<br/>Packing &amp;amp; preparing to leave here (Serapeum) at 12 noon, for Mo-aski outside Ismaila.  Major White in charge of Train arrangements Baggage etc. whilst every available man mounted a horse &amp;amp; tracked with Brigade.<br/>The New Zealand Band played us out of Camp, &amp;amp; after a pleasant trip over cultivated &amp;amp; watery country we pitched Camp about 2 miles outside Ismaila.<br/>The Brig. &amp;amp; Capt. Stracker had tea with us.<br/>We secured a 'Fantasic' of Water which holds about 15 gallons, two of which are carried on a camel.</p>
<p>Wednesday 5 April 1916<br/>We left Mo-aski near Ismaila at 5 a.m. crossing the desert to Salhia on the Railway between Zazazar &amp;amp; Kantara, 18 miles from Suez Canal.  The desert becomes very interesting at times owing to quite a variety of flowers &amp;amp; shrubs growing, also on account of the uneven nature of Ground.<br/>The Brigade was headed by Brig. Ryrie, the 6th A.L.H. leading.  Many sand dunes &amp;amp; low swampy places abound.  We arrived in Camp at 1-30 p.m. &amp;amp; set to work laying down horse Lines &amp;amp; erecting Officers Tents.</p>
