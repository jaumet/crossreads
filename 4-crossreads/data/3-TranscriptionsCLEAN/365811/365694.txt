I am so glad to hear that Keith has been having a really good holiday & hope that he is as nearly his old self again as can be expected in the time.

I have now had a long spell in England and am looking forward to its end. My board on the 9th inst. passed me for another month's Home Service but I think the next one should mark me as fit for General Service.

The depot at High Beech where I am at present stationed is in a very pleasant spot on the top of a hill in the Epping Forest. We are very fortunate in having for our quarters part of the house of a wealthy banker.

For a fortnight we have had the same mild & fine weather that I experienced in January two years ago
