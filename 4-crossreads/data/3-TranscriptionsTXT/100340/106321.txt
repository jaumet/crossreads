 Dear Sis  &amp; Vol, Just a short note to let you know I am leaving for France on Friday. I was on a draft to leave last week but was pulled off at last minute but anyway I was not left long in peace as I am on this one &amp; fourth on the list too. Am feeling OK so you need not worry about me. I have had no letters since that one about the strike. Needless to tell you that not one in ten here
