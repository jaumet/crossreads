<p>Wednesday 11 October 1916<br/>Still fine, but dull &amp; hazy &amp; with a strong wind blowing. After breakfast went down to the school in the car for the 9 o'clock lecture which was followed by a break for revising the notes &amp; then the N.C.O.s  underwent a short oral exam which was not, however, completed until the afternoon. Results generally were good, &amp; in some cases exceptionally so. Capt. Barley got home from the Somme in the evening about dinner time, his visit to the neighbourhood of Pozieres being most interesting : he brought back several souvenirs.</p>
