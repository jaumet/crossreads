<p>Each one of your letters contains an account of some fresh wonder in the garden. The hybrid sunflower must have been very beautiful more especially as it was so unique.<br/> I am glad to hear that our old family retainer "Cap" still lives up to his principles. I am afraid, though, had he been anyways hungry, that the game would have disappeared in a very short time. In any case his hunting days are over and so long as he fills the position of watch-dog he is doing very well, and for that post of honour the fatter he gets the more imposing and awe-inspiring will be his appearance.<br/>This letter dated 16th May also contained an interesting letter from Aunt Dora and one from Kit. The latter seems to be enjoying herself immensely although the early rising must be a severe tax on her, especially after being up till midnight or later  at theatre parties. One generally tires oneself more in the pursuit of amusement than at work and returns from a holiday more in need of a rest than before. Such was always my experience of fleeting trips to Sydney &amp; Brisbane.<br/>Next day after my return I received another letter from Mother dated the 21st. May and a very long and interesting one from father dated the 25th. May. Father says you received word from his sisters.<br/>Did Fanny forward you my camera? I sent it to her requesting her to keep it until she heard further from me. My real intention was to have it handy when I get leave so as to be able to send you some photos of Ireland and the family. I think she misunderstood me and sent it on to you. Is that the case? I am not sure where it is.<br/> It is some time since I heard from Mrs. Healy. I think she is waiting for me to re-open communications. You know what a poor hand I am at writing letters and you and Stirling are my only regular correspondents, and my letters to the latter are very often only Whiz-bangs</p>
