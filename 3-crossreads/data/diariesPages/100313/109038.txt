9/1/18 Bath
During the night heavy snow fell and this morning turned out dull and dark with black snowy clouds. The footpaths were extremely icy and slippery. Walked round the old Abbey and remarked on the front. Two Jacob's ladders of stone with angels ascending and descending. To show which were coming down as distinct from those going up the old architect has depicted the descending angels coming down head first. To the Grand Pump Room which is just like a large lounge or concert room. On one side is a fountain from which streams artesian water very clear and quite warm into a number of mugs. I took the waters. A maid hands over a mug on a bowl and it turned out exactly as Sam Weller said "Wery decided flavour of warm flatirons with a killibeate taste".
