<p>we looked up, after the explosions had taken place, expecting to have to meet them with the bayonet, they had faded away like mist, except for the dead &amp; wounded.  From the packs we have gone through, they were bringing over rations for several days.  Some of their food was quite good; and they had English matches in their packs &ndash; probably from the YMCA's they have over run. A man named Gilchrist of A Co. (I think) had a lot to do with stopping the Germans.  He got out with his Lewis &amp; played upon them while they were massing, making casualties according to popular reckoning, of hundreds.  The statement that the German officers advanced behind their men, driving them forward to the attack, which I never believed, has had ample verification in these stunts.  I distinctly saw an officer kick a German who faltered, &amp; threaten him with a revolver.  I had a pot at the kicker, but don't know whether it was I who got him.</p>
<p>There was an absence of artillery fire, and so things were quite good.  We don't know where the Germans are; and apparently they don't know where we are, so it is no good wasting shells, which are being used</p>
