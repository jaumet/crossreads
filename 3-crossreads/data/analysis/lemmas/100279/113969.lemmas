Armi Corp to the 3rd . and are go to be use for anoth stunt . It is dead funni some of these photo I have seen of the Tank , especi a Yanke one describ show the common old " Caterpillar tractor " as a British Tank without it coat of armour , a few of the photo have been somewher near the mark but the major onli make one laugh for they are as much like the real Tank as a pig compar to a dog
