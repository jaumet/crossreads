 Thursday 28 June 1917 
 Had no mail from AUSTRALIA for a month now &amp; no further ENGLISH news but we must be patient. I enclose with these a collection of snaps not very good but they may interest you. Weather warmer &amp; I'm reducing my KIT to 2 Blankets. Flies in 1000s &amp; the Horses with docked tails &amp; manes are suffering. 
  The first thing an Englishman does is to cut the tail &amp; mane off.  
 Post this  with love to all  as tomorrow we will be further away.
