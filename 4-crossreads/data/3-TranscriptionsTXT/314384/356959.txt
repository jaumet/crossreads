Buzz Buzz Buzzz goes the phone, and on receiving no answer the "call" is repeated. No answer again. Snowie turns to the awakened one, and remarks, "Come on Wattie lines gone."

Outside our dugout door we pick up our wires and after floundering along for a few yards discover the break. Having at last repaired the line we return Home, where after a "test" with satisfactory results, Wattie retires to continue his disturbed slumber.
