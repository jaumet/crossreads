Shelter Wood Camp 
2/2/17 General Gellibrand dropped in about 4 stayed talking for a while. Quite flocks of birds were flying back towards Albert coming from the direction of the trenches. Sent on forms for Dooleys promotion to Major and for that of Alderson to Captain. Had Gorman and Massie to tea and had some legal memories from the former who is one of the heads of the Victorian junior Bar. Joe Slater lectured in the huts at 7.30 p.m. and was interesting on the subject of Hand and Rifle grenades. Pedler went over to a company command in the 23rd this morning. The gun flashes show up very vividly on the snow at present. Try and arrange for the phonograph to be nightly at the disposal of the men for their entertainment. Three new officers today ? Griffen Bennett Kohn all promoted from the ranks and likely to be good men too. Indeed our officers at present are an excellent set of chaps on whom it would be difficult to improve. The doctor and others visited Pozieres today and saw the graves of some of the poor lads including the runner Goyder. I shall never forget the look on this chap's face when I sent him out to his death in '16.
