<p>28/8/19 Chemnitz<br/>Feeling rather unwell with a chill. Remained all day in bed. In the evening the Diggers Parliament had its final session.</p>
<p>29/8/19 Got up about noon. At dawn this morning land was in sight &ndash; our first sight of Australia after an absence of 4 &frac12; years. The "Wakey, Wakey! Man" had an easy job rousing the men sleeping on the promenade deck this morning. "Wakey, Wakey, Wakey!!!" "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! Here's your land!" "Get up and see the kangaroos and emus!" "Shake a leg and look at all the smiling faces on the shore!" A low dull grey coast line and a grey rolling seas with glints of [undecipherable] and low wheeling seabirds. At lunch we were somewhat about Albany &ndash; a little later came in dull squally conditions.</p>
