11/12/18 Boulogne
A wet morning. Spent it in walking around the streets and lanes of this truly rural hamlet inspecting the company lines and talking to officers and men there. Rations are not too good at all. The country is all enclosed hedges and quite like Selles and like Taunton. People have not had a bad time. We run two messes for the officers. HQ A & B at one and C & D at the other. The afternoon was also very wet. Hutton came back from Charleroi which he says is a splendid fine town and in full swing. We shall 13 kilos out and Mayer says cognac & other liquor is frequent. Warmed to the French people at my billet they have a peculiar accent & patois. Got very little news from the Huns during their occupation. Wrote letters all evening.
