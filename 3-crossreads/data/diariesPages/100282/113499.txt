"Brasso" (as they call the Colonel of the 1st Field Ambulance, for his fondness of having all brass work clean shiny) were both playing, it was a drawn game both sides scoring a "try", you would have laughed if you could have heard the barrackers singing out go.on the butchers, No. 9, iodine, etc, meaning this of course for the A.M.C. who were all doctors, there were a few Australian nurses down at the match this afternoon, they were dressed in pre war day clothes, they looked mighty fine, made us all feel miserable to a certain extent I think for we seem to be wasting our time so long have we been away from the society of our own bonny girls, we miss them more more as the days roll by.
I put a nasty gash in my hand yesterday evening while we were having a bit of fun with the ball must have got caught in something sharp on someones clothes for it made a pretty mess of my hand,
