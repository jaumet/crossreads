<p>April 1915<br/>Practically impregnable. Directly they touched shore they jumped into water, some over their heads. As they touched the shore they fixed bayonets and drove Turks up and over the precipitous heights for about 4 m. Officers and men mixed. Men did not wait for orders but fought as seemed most natural in general line. Had to retire to position we found ourselves on arrival later as no support. Several thousand casualties.<br/>Examination of hills show an almost impossibility of advance. Kit and dead everywhere. Heroic stands for 2 or 3 days without water and food</p>
