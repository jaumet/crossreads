Monday 20
Still anchored out in the harbour.
Medical inspection at 10.30 at which I assisted the doctor.
Royal George crammed with troops arrived in the afternoon.
After tea received instructions to proceed to Anzac at 12 tomorrow.
Everyone excited to a mild degree & plenty of chaff going the rounds.
Had a good yarn on a variety of topics with a [indecipherable] man well read & interesting. Comes from near Birkenhead.
Wish I had met him earlier.
