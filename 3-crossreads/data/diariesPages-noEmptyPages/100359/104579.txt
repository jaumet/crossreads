Sunday July 16th
The Kaiser used this place for his Headquarters, till the Tommies arrived and he "got" for his life. There are plenty of rations about, plenty of butter and jam. Got an issue of smokes 4 pkts. Cigs and tin tobacco, but best of all is the glorious big mail. I just sat up in bed and devoured ?em word for word. Spent the day quietly putting our things in order. About 3 in the afternoon Bob Roberts started rushing around with a list of names to go out to the trenches again. My name was down, but I hurt my hand yesterday, fooling around with a cartridge and so had to stay behind. Mac and Wrighty and Bricky and most of the old crowd went out, but no nursing men went this time. Capt. Irving Hutchinson and the great "I know ? what" went with ?em. Went to bed early, as have had very little sleep during the past week. Things are very quiet about the village of Fort Rompu.

Cpl. Marlow called down some strong language on his head by rousing me at 6 a.m. to be on picquet "Blue" went on 1 entrance gate and I the other came off at 10, had a wash an went back to bed. Slept in a loft over a pigstye, aroma very"high". Plenty of clean straw. Nothing much doing all day. Wrote letter to Mother. Things were quiet along the front last night very few cases came in. Went on picquet again from 6 til 10. Plenty of traffic of all kinds going along the roads. Wasn't sorry when 10 came, then turned in among the straw again. About 2 a.m.
Tuesday 18th
Cpl. Roberts roused us all on the "Gas Alert" then everyone was scrambling around after his helmet. On "no duties" today so am taking things easy. Nothing came of the Gas Alarm "Fritz didn't send any over, had an easy day, not many cases coming in. Changed my quarters to where the Aroma is not so high.
