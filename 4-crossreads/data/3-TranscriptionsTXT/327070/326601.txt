Air appreciably warmer. Day fine & clear & sea a good deal calmer. Numerous flying-fish seen. Ordinary routine of work, enlivened by an inoculation for typhoid in the morning which gave me a sore arm in the afternoon & evening, & also by a hunt for officers with long hair, my clippers being many times called into play.
Prescott resisted nobly but eventually had a big junk removed from the front & then submitted: he was left with a nice round tuft on his crown. Several of the others also fought, but were subdued & left with lighter heads, two of them having a strip of long hair left from the forehead to the crown. I had taken the precaution of getting my orderly to run over mine - front & all - the previous afternoon, but was persuaded to have my moustache attended to by one of the sufferers, with what are declared to be excellent results - so it is said - 10 yrs younger!
When we turned up at mess there was quite a commotion, & I hope tomorrow to get one or two snaps to illustrate the causes.
Ship's run to noon was 384 miles.

Another fine day with smooth sea. Approach to the tropics indicated by all stewards being in white when we went down to breakfast. Routine not varied during the day.
