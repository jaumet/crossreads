<p>[Transcriber's note:  James McCall Young, Scottish born, living in Diamond Creek Victoria, enlisted on 6 March, 1917 at 30 years of age.  This second diary commences in Codford, England with the journey across to France.  Most of his time is spent in the Somme area where he describes his duties working on the guns, tending the horses and donkeys and at times being the cook.  He describes the various attacks from both sides in the air and on the ground and gives some details of those killed and wounded.  At times he explores the surrounding villages, looking at the churches and the area in general and commenting on the devastation that has taken place.]</p>
