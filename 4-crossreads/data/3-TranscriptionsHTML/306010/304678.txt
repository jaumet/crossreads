<p>the fact that the smooth running of the hospital must not be interfered with. I have been bombarded with questions from morning to night &ndash; all concerning leave of course. It is the one &amp; only topic of conversation. I was forgetting to mention that I also had to find out to which railway station in the United Kingdom each man wished to go to and also try &amp; arrange for pals to go together. At any rate, I shall be glad when the whole of this leave business is over.<br/>Yesterday was the second anniversary of my enlistment in the A.I.F. &ndash; 6 weeks in camp in Australia, 8 weeks on a transport, 14 months in Egypt, 6 &frac12;  months in France. How time has passed.<br/>Am trying to get 5 days leave</p>
