<p>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot, but came up a southerly</p>
<p>gale in evening with clouds of dust.</p>
<p>Tickle &amp; I got the Mountain mill</p>
<p>going in the morning, and took</p>
<p>some things down to Pryor in</p>
<p>afternoon. He ought to have the</p>
<p>tower up tomorrow.</p>
