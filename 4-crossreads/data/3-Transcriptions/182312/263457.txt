<p>time and be a very expensive process I had little doubt, but I thought</p>
<p>that a start had been made.&nbsp; I am forced to think now that I was a bit</p>
<p>premature in my hopes.&nbsp; Possibly our next Spring&#39;s offensive will mark</p>
<p>the beginning of the end and I am confident that this end will be brought</p>
<p>about not by shortage of money, food or munitions, but solely by wastage</p>
<p>of men until the enemy has insufficient soldiers to hold her fronts.</p>
<p>When that time comes she will sky the towel.&nbsp; Germany will never let</p>
<p>herself be driven back to the Rhine and so allow our big guns to get to</p>
<p>work on her towns.&nbsp; The end will come suddenly and with the line - at</p>
<p>least on the Western Front, and I am assuming that the battle fields on</p>
<p>this front will decide the future of Europe - very much where it stands</p>
<p>now.&nbsp; But we have yet to kill a lot of Germans before he will give in,</p>
<p>and we are going to lose a lot in the killing.&nbsp; The next Allied push</p>
<p>will need to be better controlled and not a one-after-the-other affair</p>
<p>like this year&#39;s effort.&nbsp; I once saw a dozen or so Fijians trying to</p>
<p>lift a heavy spar from a steamer&#39;s deck:&nbsp; first one would lift and then</p>
<p>a couple more would give a jerk, but the spar defied them until an</p>
<p>officer came along and gave them the signal to heave all together.&nbsp; It</p>
<p>is the same with us, we lack a general control.&nbsp; The germans have it</p>
<p>and have made the best use of it in a way that only feeble dishonesty</p>
<p>can deny.&nbsp; At every front is being felt the influence of the National</p>
<p>reorganisation of Germany under the master management of Hindenburg and</p>
<p>Ludendorff.&nbsp; Under them the army is working night and day with fresh</p>
<p>heart and everybody who has been on the Somme can give the lie direct</p>
<p>to the facile trash about the supposed demoralization and broken spirit</p>
<p>of the foe.&nbsp; Behind the army all Germany is working.&nbsp; In ruthless</p>
<p>fashion the population of the occupied territories of Belgium, France</p>
<p>Poland, Servia and (soon) Roumania are being driven into workshops or on</p>
<p>to the land partly to swell the output of munitions and partly to</p>
<p>release more Germans for Military service.&nbsp; Most important the military</p>
