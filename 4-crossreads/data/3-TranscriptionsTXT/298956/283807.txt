 Commander wanted.  He made his big dashes at night.  There were very few of us who wished him to meet anything like a cruiser.  It was no use.  He had done all the damage he set out to do.  What was the use of sending 480 prisoners to the bottom. 
 Well we arrived in safe water on the 16th February, and the next night the 17th February, we dropped anchor, and I being an orderly this night saw the searchlights of several ships, destroyers and patrol boats directed on us.  I was just coming back with the tea when a Hun engineer stopped me and pointed to the ships said (Look my boy, the German Blockade Britania Rules the Waves, eh?".  I didn't answer him but I would have liked to have killed him and that laugh of his.  I wished him a nice death if ever the "Wolf" went on another raiding trip. 
 I forgot to mention that at this time we were bad with "Scurvy" through no fresh vegetables we had six cases in all. 
 We stayed at this anchorage quarantined for a week and then on the 24th February we steamed for Kiel.  We of course being under deck until we passed through the mine fields guarding the entrance of Kiel harbour, and then we were allowed on deck, so that the Germans could see the English pigs the "Wolf" had brought back after being away for fifteen months. 
 She got a fine welcome.  Kiel was full of warships, cruisers, dreadnoughts, battleships, destroyers, etc.  The "Wolf" steamed along the line and as she passed each ship the men of the different ships gave three Hun cheers and a band struck up.  There were seaplanes and aeroplanes flying above us and submarines around us.  Also launches full of people came to see the prisoners. 
 The next day the Kaisers Brother, Prince Henry, came on board and spoke to a couple of our chaps.  He said "I didn't think America would have come into the war against us, but never mind,  we  will see it through"
