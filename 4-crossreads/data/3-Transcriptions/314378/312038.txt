<p>Beni Souef<br/>Egypt<br/>20th May 21915</p>
<p>My Dear Bertha</p>
<p>I am still on the convalesent list, therefore still in Egypt, with 5 other chaps.  I am at present the guest of an English Gentleman here.  Our Host is the head of the forth circle of irrigation in Egypt.  Truly there are many sides to a Soldier's life &amp; I am seeing them all.  Only a few days ago I was fighting for my life, never knowing what moment would be my last.  Today I am living in luxury with servants to do my slightest bidding.  When I wake in the morning my servant is always waiting.  As soon as he sees that I am awake, he approaches my bed on tiptoe as if he were afraid of frightening me, he then informes me that my bath is ready, everything that he says is punctuated with Excellency.  Can you imagine it the old Arch. K. as your Excellency.  The English Residents of Beni Souef have laid themselves out to entertain us &amp; needless to say they succeed, every day there is something different to be done or a different place to visit.  But for all the good times I am having I am getting impatient to be back with my mates in the firing line again.  Perhaps if I had not tried to stay when I knew it was impossible I may have been back now.  People who do silly things generally have to pay for them in the end.  I stayed in the firing line for four days after I had sprained my ankle, but it got so bad in the end that I had to make my way to the beach at last, using my rifle for a crutch.</p>
