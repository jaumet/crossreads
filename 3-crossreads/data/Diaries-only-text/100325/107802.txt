Some fine looking Moslem women daintily dressed ? high heels , white [indecipherable] guarded by two Nubian Eunuchs. Beautifully figures and plenty of "glad eye". It is hard to realise they are the same race as the filthy hags sitting in the gutter. Could now see end of street and stopped at corner of Charet ? el ? Azhar. Consulted map and went round corner to Gami el Azhar ? the moslem university. The minaret beautifully carved the stone appears to hang from the balcony like folds and tassels of cloth. The same stone carving over gates and on adjoining buildings ? over 1000 years old. Crowds along footpath in front of big wall some praying others rocking in ecstasy. Went right round building which is said to contain 9000 students from all over the world. No guides coming forward. Saw the Gate of Barbers. Returned to side and hired boy to show us over. Put on slippers and mosque attendant leads on. In big courtyard 700 alabaster pillars very ancient. Crowds about. Saw rooms allotted to different nations
