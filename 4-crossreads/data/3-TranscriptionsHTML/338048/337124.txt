<p>was to act as No 6. on a detachment after breakfast. The horse allotted to me was already saddled and after much hurry was in time for parade at 8 a.m. There is a great deal of work here to be done in a very little time. The Tommies manage all right by going without a wash between stables &amp; breakfast but we will not do that.</p>
<p>I had a very good time out all day as No. 6 who has the hardest job of all. Good horsemanship is required for this but as the pace never exceeded a walk &amp; as the horse knew the work thoroughly I got on well &ndash; We returned about 3-30 p.m. as all horses must be in about 3 p.m. and after being paid &pound;3-10-0 &ndash; had dinner (I have a snack at midday). Tea was on shortly after &amp; then a kit inspection was held about 6 pm. in our own time. Worn out underclothing is to be replaced very shortly and inspection was mainly to see what replacements were necessary.</p>
<p>Tuesday 8th<br/>Mess orderly today so no parades for me except roll call at 5-20 a.m. Duties are to get the meals &amp; to wash up the china utensils in hot water drying evidently not being considered necessary. This does not take long so I have plenty of spare time. Walk through villages at night.</p>
