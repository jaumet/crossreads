  
 Concerts and impromptu stump speeches each evening to pass away the time. Quite a crop of budding politicians among the Company. 
 12th April 1917 At Sea. 
 About 7 A m this morning we approached the Cocas Islands a group of small Islands in the Indian Ocean mid way from Colombo to Freemantle. About 2 miles away on our Port side we passed the battered remains of the German Cruiser "Emden" which was sunk by gunfire and beached by HMAS "Sydney" on the morning of the 9th November 1914. This route, through the Cocas group is I believe unusual. Ships generally go around the group, but with troops they generally come past here to let them see the remains of the "Emden". There is of course nothing much to see actually only a battered and twisted hull battered almost beyond recognition by the Sydney's 6 inch guns on that memorable morning.
