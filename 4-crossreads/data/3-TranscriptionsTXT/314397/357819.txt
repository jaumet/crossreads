Went to MER  & to EU. Mer on the sea much like le Treport & is very nice. EU is a big place & very clean. Had a look at the big church there & just after coming out from it Dinney Shearer came along on a charabanc, so went back to Le Treport with him. He & I went up to the 2nd General Hospital & had a talk to two or three wounded Aussie officers there. Rained all day & spoilt a good night away. Left there about 7.30 & missed rain all the way. Gee we were lucky tho.
