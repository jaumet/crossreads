<p>31 Thursday<br/>Had a good sleep all the morning.  Went up to Poziers about midday. Fritz was very quiet until about 6 pm  Some Canadian troops took over from our fellows up in the line.  The Australians are leaving the Poziers front. There is a brigade of Canadians here.  After being humbugged about a good bit by some of the Canadian Officers we shifted from Poziers to another dug-out about &frac12; mile away. Had a busy night. Owing to the sap being very muddy we carried along the parapet, which was a big risk as the snipers were very busy with the machine guns, bullets were whizzing every minute. Fritz put a good few tear shells over, the stuff got into our eyes &amp; nearly blinded us. I was crying nearly all night.</p>
<p>1 September Friday<br/>Rather a quiet morning here.  We get plenty of cigarettes &amp; tobacco issued to us here &amp; good food considering the position where we are.  Fritz is exceptionally quiet this morning.  Went back to Headquarters <strike>about</strike> at dinner time.  Fritz put a good few shells around Head quarters in the evening, very quiet otherwise.  The weather is very changeable here, raining one five minutes &amp; sunshining the next, I suppose the firing of the guns have some effects on it.</p>
<p>2 Saturday<br/>Fritz is unusually quiet today.  He put up a slight bombardment in the afternoon   went up to right side dressing station about midday, not many casualties, we had <indecipherable> cases in the afternoon.  Saw a great air combat between one of our planes &amp; one of Fritzs.  Fritz got the best of our fellow &amp; brought him down in the German lines, our fellows brought down 3 of Fritzs, it was very exciting.</p>
<p>3 Sunday<br/>A terrible bombardment commenced about 5 am by all of our artillary, you couldn't hear yourself talk.  The 3rd Brigade after attacking twice captured Mouquet farm. Very busy during the early morning. Fritz put a few shells very close to our dressing station &amp; a couple on it, but there were no casualties.  The Canadians are losing a good few men.</p>
