Dear Old Dad.
I have got Frank's cat because he has got the dog his name is Bing.  Mother made up the name.  And I have been home about 1 hour and a half an hour.  And mum is just cook-ing 4. fowl's for Miss Heffernan.  Miss Heffernan is not teacking to-day or to-morrow Because her father is dying.  And Mr. Collier is litting one of his girls.  That is Jessie Martin; And Ivy Blackreed.  And Frank is just thinking about what to put.  And there is the Black-town show for large Hand Writing for the school's and I was going in but one of them girls told me that I could not write as good as they could.  It is a pretty little pup.  It is the first time I have wrotingNo 2 page But Frank is writing the No. 6. page I am going To do some drawing if I can but I don't know.
