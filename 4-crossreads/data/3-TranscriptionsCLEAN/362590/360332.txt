the men are only drawing between one & two shillings a day, it takes quite a considerable time to pay it off. During the last few weeks, two or three men have been shot for disobeying orders.

I got a letter from Leslie Whitfeld some time ago but threw away the letter without looking at the address. I was glad to hear he got into a school & hope he gets his commission all right. I hear Geoff Hughes has not had any luck yet. While at Tel-el-Kebir I met quite a number of University men. Geoff Street, who is now Captain & adjutant of the 1st Bn is looking better than I've ever seen him before.
We are not allowed to blow bugles out here, but a whistle followed by the words officers mess reminds me that I am hungry.
Your affectionate son
Arthur.
