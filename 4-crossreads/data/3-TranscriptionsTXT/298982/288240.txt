You'll notice the officers dailyTheir bottles with water fillThey never drink beer or spirits boysSo follow you leaders will
If you come far away to fightThen kill in a kinder wayDazzle the your foes with your polish BoysBlinded they'll lose the day
Each fortnight when you get your payBuy polish & cleaning gearPerhaps & cake & or ginger beer BoysBut dont for Gods sake buy beer
