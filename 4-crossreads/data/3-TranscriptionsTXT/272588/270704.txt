Friday 10 MayA couple of days ago a curious incident happened in the air on this front.  Owing to a Frenchman being out of his area, &amp; not returning a Britisher's signal, he was shot down by the Englisher &amp; killed.  Another Frenchman was brought down with a hole in his petrol tank.  Both Frenchmen were good fliers. The Funeral of the Frenchman took place to-day from here, attended by Australian &amp; French officers &amp; men.Quiet to-day. "B" beat "A" Section at cricket.
