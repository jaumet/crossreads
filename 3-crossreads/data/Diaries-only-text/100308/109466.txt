Bullecourt
The G. was in the small hours to see us and to watch the explosion of some Bangalore torpedoes which had been pushed under the wire by some sappers guided by our patrols. Awakened about 4 a.m. with streaming eyes, nasal rheum and every symptom of approaching bad cold ? a rarity since starting to soldier. Three Dovers powders from Craig aborted it. During morning word came for our relief by 7th Bde. Some of our men on road work others cutting a sap over an exposed crest on the road. Farrell had about 6 horses right up here this morning. Inspected positions along the sunken road and found the whole place dirty. Tins strewing the tops of the banks and much food and other rubbish about. Unless extreme care is exercised there is a considerable waste of bombs and S.A.A. Sanitation under these conditions is a matter requiring unremitting attention. Roused everyone up and got large improvements made.
