  
 [Tuesday 26 September 1916] 
 Went Belfast & to the Ulster Club where I write these notes- Today we lunch with Mrs Ferrar's sister & dine with her brother. All the Neill Clan live together or near each other. Tomorrow I go to "Warrenpoint" to see Aunt Anna. Beautiful weather but Cold still with me . Got a wire that Davy family were returning as son [indecipherable] was very ill in France- caught train went  R  Warrenpoint & saw them all- stayed night with Aunt Anna who I found wonderfully well & bright.  Had to cross the Carlingford Loch to catch train at Omeath
