<p>[Wednesday 2 August 1916]</p>
<p>Night outpost tonight very quiet &amp; very weird.  This Desert is fine Sand different to LIBYAN Desert which is stony &amp; you could <u>hear</u> any one approaching.<br/>Here Camels are absolutely silent- while <u>our</u> horses neigh &amp; rattle bits &amp; irons.  MONITORS shelled enemy lines from Mediteranean today.<br/>I said yesterday the Devils dropped <u>no darts</u> but in another part of the Camp they threw out 1000s especially over the poor CAMELS, Little 6 inch steel arrows like they dropped on the Peninsular &amp; capable of going clean through a man-  <strike>I believe the [indecipherable] setting Flags stick Pins in one too !!!!</strike></p>
