<p>Dec.28th We were chased off the deck at 3.A.M. this morning by a shower of rain but it cleared up later &amp; was a fairly fine day, my cold eases off towards evening. Read &#39;The Wilderness&#39; Joseph Hocking - In the evening we played 500.</p>
<p>Dec.29th It was very showery today, we had physical jerks all the morning. Sports were held in afternoon &amp; evening, the record for skipping was 3380 - We had a front seat for the boxing in the evening.</p>
<p>Dec.30th A beautiful warm day we were on fatigue preparing for the sports which were held in the afternoon, &amp; we had a front seat again in the evening for the boxing.</p>
<p>Dec.31st Sunday again &amp; another beautiful day with a shower or two at intervals. We are mostly wearing shorts &amp; singlets &amp; going bare-foot. I spent the day on the deck in the sun reading &amp; sleeping. I read &quot;Happy Valley&#39; &nbsp;B.M. Crocker, very pretty yarn. Saw one of the most beautiful sun-sets I have ever seen &amp; watched it intently for over an hour - &amp; the night was wonderful - so ends the year 1916.</p>
