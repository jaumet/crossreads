<p>Thursday 6.1.15 (15)<br/>It was raining this morning when I woke up &amp; it rained all day. We had a bonza lecture by Captain Bray in the afternoon &amp; I played cards at night. We are a very sociable lot in our unit. Every day or night you will see different fellows from different wards playing at the one table. There is absolutely no clickerism.</p>
<p>One of our chaps was operated on for appendicitis this night. He was only attached early in the day. He is doing well.</p>
<p>If we had been a sailing ship we would be much further ahead. We have had the wind behind us nearly all the trip.</p>
