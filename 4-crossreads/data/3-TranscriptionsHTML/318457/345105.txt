<p>In command of Lieut Bowen were sent by one of the destroyers to land at Cocklepool Bay on the south shore of the channel, to proceed to the wireless station. Really on 33 men all told, including the commander and Surgeon Capt. Pockley at first attacked the Germans defending the wireless sta.</p>
<p>At the same time a landing party of about 25 under Lieut-Comm Finlayson and Lieut Goodchild (Werrego) went ashore at Herbertshohe where he had just a month ago destroyed the post office instruments.  These occupied the building and made them a depot. Sub-Lieut Webber with about 17 men made another party (originally part of Bowen's party) to search the country to the north west. Nothing was heard of these until 4pm. Lieut-Com Finlayson feared that they had been cut off. They penetrated about 10 miles but found nothing of special interest and returned being helped by a connecting link of 5 men sent from our party at Herbertshohe. They met about 10 blacks on the way out but these fled and no firing took place.  A German armed escort, was seized by one of our party and eventually brought on board</p>
