  
 September, 1915 Friday 10 Lovely weather now & cool nights, am posting you some snapshots of Anzac today.  Heard today that the Transport carrying some of the 6th Brigade has been torpedoed -  Col: Linton  Brigadier & about 20 others drowned - Jack Lorimer & Harry Phillips are in that Brigade, but hope were not among the 20. It surprises me that more transports are not sunk considering the shipping between Alexandria & Gallipoli .
