  
 inboard the Fantome & had Beef - Mutton Steak ?pudding or pie  - no one could tell - but we got the meat & some beer - & then I ordered out the Port & Sherry to be put in front of me & sent them round twice & this made a cheery crowd - cheerier & we had a pleasant evening & all went well - P & S only cost us (duty free) 3d per glass & it certainly does no harm a couple of wine glasses. At 7 am I leapt from the rails of the Fantome into the ditch - Dam the sharks. One other officer & I do this every morning - Of course we go like blazes to the gangway & get on it - I don't think there's any danger & it is so refreshing to dip in the briny - Jackson lets all his crew jump over-board daily & I urge Fitz to keep our men fit by swimming & bathing - The men quote me to their officers "The doctor says it's better than his medicine - so healthy - Sir" -
