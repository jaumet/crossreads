 Friday 1 June 
 Lovely Day. Military Medals have been awarded in connection with the Bullecourt business.  Only two are deserving cases, one being Lce. Cpl. Marlow who is receiving a bar to a medal already won.  Much dissension exists in the unit rendering the decorations valueless.  I now repeat my previous impressions with regard to awards viz. that 9 out of every ten are useless.  They certainly are  not  looked upon as honours.  Far from it.  The best men get nothing at all.  Gen. Tivey inspected the camp yesterday &amp; was delighted. The Australians (now out of the line are undergoing special training &amp; sports are included.
