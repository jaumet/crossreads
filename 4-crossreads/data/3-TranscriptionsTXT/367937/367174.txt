I wrote to Aunt Katie from the boat; hope she got it.We get a paper here every morning "The Egyptian Times" but there is absolutely no news in it.  I will send you a copy later on if I get a chance.I am not going to spend any money on post cards or souvenirs of Egypt; the photos I take are more interesting I think don't you?Please give my regards to Mr Radcliff & Florrie Love to Aunt Katie.What sort of time did you have at midwinter?Cold I suppose I wish I was!I am your loving brotherRobert C Wilson
