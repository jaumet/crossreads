doctor. We were all formed up in a long row and passed out in quick time. Marked fit to travel. Name of destination Dartford, but was instructed to return to St Chads for further treatment.River Cam a banker. Water in side canal flowing over pavement.Friday 19. Still raining. Now and again clears up to let it snow.u>Saty 20th. Doctor at Eastern Hospital instructed me to come around and see him when I get word about being shifted from St. Chads. He had a look at my feet and handed me a recommendation stating that it was his opinion that I was quite unable to march and only fit for sedentary duties. One thing I know and this is, that I will never have to carry a pack again, and its probable I will not have to return to France. Likely will be put on clerical duties work in England.
