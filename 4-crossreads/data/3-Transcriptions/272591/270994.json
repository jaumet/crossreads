At dinner time met Broughton who came over with me on the Anchises &ndash; he is now on leave from France. After tea Hutton &amp; I went to the Social again &amp; had a good time. Arrived home 10 pm. At Science Museum also saw a pendulum used for trigonometrical survey of India during the 1860's &amp; afterwards lent to United States for their geodetic survey. The astronomical section of Museum is extremely interesting. Also saw some seismograph instruments for recording earthquakes, also a telescope used for observing transit of Venus about the 1760's. They also have models of mines, including the mine at Clunes in Victoria; models of bridges of various types, models of all classes of ships &ndash; complete &amp; in section also of their engines.
