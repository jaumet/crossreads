Had route marches to-day in order to give us exercise. There was quite a spring touch about the air which made walking a great pleasure indeed. We have got very comfortable quarters, a big contrast from the miserable existence which we had, when we were on our way to Anzac, at this place. We had evidence of the strict discipline of the so-called British Army. Two young fellows were standing tied to a post. This punishment they had got for purely minor offences.
Men in the Aussie army do things ten times worse and get nothing done to them for it.

In the evening we went to a Lecture on "Canada" given by Capt Frost, a Canadian Chaplain attached to one of the hospitals
