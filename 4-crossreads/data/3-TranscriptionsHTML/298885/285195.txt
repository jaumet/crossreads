<p>Feb 11th &ndash; 18<br/>Set out apr&egrave;s (after) breakfast per pushbike in search of Norrie but no such luck but my search was not altogether fruitless as I met Clive Dunlop who is with the Aust Flying Corps</p>
<p>Feb 12th &ndash; 18<br/>After obtaining the report of the close proximity of my old battery I sauntered out to have a yarn with all of the old boys and spent a very fine night</p>
<p>Feb 13th &ndash; 18<br/>As promised I started out to see Stan. Unfortunately it was a miserable, misty, murky, melancholy sort of day</p>
