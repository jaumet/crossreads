 Mazar On our way back to "Beyond", the first time our Reg. has ever been behind. Now a new Hospital train runs along the road. We pioneered fresh water at different spots, but our men would sooner be going on to Palestine. 
 Wet last night & I was Field Officer, but NO enemy near us now. We are on a 60 mile Trek & find much work has been done behind, later on it would be a good spec: to open a first class Hotel & Casino at El Arish for those Cooks tourists who will go this way to Palestine. TIMMS came & spoke to me today, he's doing well.
