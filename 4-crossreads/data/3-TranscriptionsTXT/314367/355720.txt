We landed Heritage at Rabaul - not at all a bad chap but a bit of a bore I should think - Fitz has an idea he's twisted his inside!! - what he's done is fall flat on the water & bruise his abdominal muscles & he feels it when he moves - Getting into a boat from the water is also a young active man's game - not a flabby fat one's - I'm nice & thin - I think I weigh less than when at GI -Breakfast - Biscuit - treacle - cup of coffee - Finish. I'll tell you a curious fact in connection with the 1st Australian Contingent - Not a padre - not one - Here's 1500 men - more - & many of them used to a religious Service - but not a service ashore - no worship & this is British - A good padre is a most helpful chap - Some live padre should come up & go round - He'd do a lot of good & be heartily welcomed by men & officers - There's sick & dying men here & anyone of us reads the Burial Service - There's more for a Padre to face up here than in Europe - I know -
