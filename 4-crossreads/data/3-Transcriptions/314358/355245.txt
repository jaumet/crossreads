<p>France<br/>19 Nov 1917<br/>Dear Beatrice/<br/>Dear Mother/</p>
<p>Am at present in a peaceful part of France resting</p>
<p>It is quite a relief to be away from the active areas of war, far removed from the clamour and roar; and beyond the waste of ruined lands and villiages. Yes it is indeed.</p>
<p>Only those who have experienced uncertain life in the forward areas of this war can fully appreciate what it is to once more find oneself in a place of peace where there are civilians pursuing the occupations of life under normal conditions.  To get away from the sight of wreck and ruin; out of the range of shell fire, and from beneath a sky of bombs, is a blessing for which all of us are thankful.</p>
<p>To once more see smiling faces and to hear the voices of children.</p>
<p>To be able to wander about without concern as to the risks against ones life.</p>
