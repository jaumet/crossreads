<p>BIR-el-ABD</p>
<p>Arrived here. You will remember me speaking of BIR-el-ABD last July &ndash; now a big military Camp, Pumping Station, Hospitable etc. &amp; a canteen both wet &amp; dry.</p>
<p>[The following is crossed through]<br/>2 Officers came along &amp; offered 2 bottles of Beer (with patent costs) for some butter. After they had gone we found bottles refilled with <u>Water</u> - Assualt made &amp; Bivouacs wrecked &ndash; am afraid there will be many sore heads tomorrow, so many of these chaps overdo it when they reach a Canteen.</p>
<p>[continued from the end of previous page]<br/>sorry after all Mother's work but am afraid it went "down" a boat.</p>
