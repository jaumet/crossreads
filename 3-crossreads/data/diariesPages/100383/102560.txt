took an hour & twenty five minutes to cross the channel. We pulled in at Folkstone & got straight on to the train which was waiting & travelled first class & after two & half hours run go out at Victoria Station. On alighting we were lined up in fours & marched to Headquarters at Horseferry Road where we were given twenty four hours leave & a pay.

At night I went to the theatre & had a good look around & stayed At the War Chest Club. Next day the 10th at two oâ€™clock we left by train from Waterloo Station & alighted at Amesbury after changing a couple of times. When I alighted I took motor to Camp at Durrington & reported & was told off to our respective huts.

After a couple of days spell we had to settle down to parade ground work. On Sunday the 13th received leave & went into Salisbury by motor bus from Amesbury. It is a fine little town & has a beautiful big Cathedral surrounded by big well kept lawns & the Spire is a fine piece of workmanship & is well up in the air. The numerous little canals & parks & fine buildings & business places make the place very picturesque. On Monday morning I was told off with one man as escort for a court martial case & at dinner time I was given orders to proceed to Birkenhead as escort to bring prisoner back. I left camp at 2.30 pm & walked to Amesbury
