 Thursday 23 January 1919 Rafa The Two Up School keeps me awake till midnight each night.  I gave my Batman a &pound;1 for pourboire and he won &pound;33/-/- in one night, some other poor devil lost!  Very cold &amp; Bronchitis bad.  Trying to write up History of Regt. but with Drill Orders &amp; interruptions it is an impossible task.  We are supposed to give men Technical Training for after-war life.  The Lectures are a farce given by Amateurs who are very nervous &amp; the men feel it is sort of "Trying it on the dog" business as no one else would listen.
