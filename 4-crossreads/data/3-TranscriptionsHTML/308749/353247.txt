<p>that you can see of them is a few sticks and smoke, and a big sailing ship passed us when just a few days off Sydney. She looked lovely with all sails set.</p>
<p>The fire alarm goes at times unexpectedly, and we have to get our life belts on and run up on deck, and then parade at the boats we are alloted to. There was an alarm went last night and there was great sport finding your belt in the dark, but we are all getting used to the alarms by now. I was on guard duty all day yesterday, from 8 a.m. until 8 a.m. next day, 24 hours, each man has four shifts to do 2 hours on duty and 4 hours off, it isn't a bad time, but in the early morning I struck from 2 a.m. until 4 a.m. and it is misery watching the clock go round. I was  glad when my turn came to knock off so that I could have some sleep. I could have gone asleep at my post only I didn't dare, as there is always a lieutenant on the watch for the loafers. The signallers don't have a chance to have lessons on the wireless on board as everything is a secret in that line, but we have buzzer practice every day, the only drill we have is physical training every morning before breakfast, it keeps one fit, and when the boat starts to roll a bit it is great sport doing some of the exercises. This boat had hard luck ever since we have started as she has broken down many times at sea, but lately she has been going again a.1, and there have been measles on board from the very first, and now the dreaded disease meningitius has broken out on board with the result one man died last night.</p>
