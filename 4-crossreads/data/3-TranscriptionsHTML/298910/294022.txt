<p>6/7/16  Thursday</p>
<p>Dull cold day. Issued with 2 Gas Helmets per man &ndash; also had a lot Gas drill, had to have our helmets on within 10 seconds, it means more bulk to carry. Went for a march thro Hazebruck in the afternoon &ndash; Good news of progress along all our lines still comes in -  Notice a lot of observation balloons up &ndash; great bombarding going on all day. Some of the German trenches they say are 25 feet deep.</p>
<p>Attend the Village Church every evening possible for the Rosary. The Boys are spending money very freely in the village &amp; naturally everybody says we are jolly good fellows.</p>
<p>7/7/16  Friday</p>
<p>Raining nearly all day &ndash; roads very sloppy. Marched out (2 Battalions of the 5th Division) through Morabecque to a field near the trenches &ndash; here we were lined up &amp; a gas cloud was liberated &amp; we had to go through it &ndash; followed almost by an explosion of tear shells which are very severe on the eyes &amp; bring tears otherwise nobody suffered any casualties.
