<p>last night &amp; finish up at 5 p.m. tonight</p>
<p>Oct 12<br/>It is just getting dusk as we are running into Port Said having had a <strike>smooth</strike> calm &amp; uneventful journey</p>
<p>Oct 13<br/>We did not disembark last night as expected, but this morning the British Troops have been getting off &amp; the Ship is we believe taking us on to Kantara this afternoon (kantara = E1Qantara on Suez Canal)</p>
<p>We shall be glad to get off for she is a <u>Hungry</u> Ship. We have sent in complaints &amp; the only effect was to have some rigmarole read out about being on "Lines of Communication Scale</p>
