Last Tuesday week I rode to Salisbury &amp; back to Stonehenge &amp; thence to Salisbury again nearly 40 miles altogether &amp; I did not leave Camp till 1.30 pm, had 2 Hours rest on the road &amp; finished in Salisbury just after six.  It started to rain about 10 pm so I came Home by Train.  On Tuesday this week I rode the 12 &frac12; miles in 40 minutes &amp; there's some Hills on these <u>Plains</u>   of Salisbury.  I met one of the Courtney's from Manly.  He is a 1st Lieutenant in the Infantry.  Billy A came down last Friday just in time to get His parcel from the Comforts fund.  Ellis &amp; I both got a flannel shirt, a pair of socks, a face washer &amp; a small Tube of Tooth Paste.  It was all very welcome.  Mrs Thomas was responsible for my lot</p>
