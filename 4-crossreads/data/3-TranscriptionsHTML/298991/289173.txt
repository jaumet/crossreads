<p>Friday May 25th<br/>A lovely day. Caught 10.15 am express from Paddington to Weymouth. It was very hard leaving London, &amp; seemed rotten when I arrived back at camp at No 2 Command Depot, Westham. Had a very nice journey down; some people who were on their way down here for their summer holidays, &amp; in the same carriage as myself, were very kind &amp; obliging to me, the old chap sported a cup of tea, biscuits &amp; sandwiches for dinner. Very quiet in Camp.</p>
<p>Saturday May 26th<br/>Camp is very quiet, of course the usual lots come &amp; go. I was put in No 2 hut, I don't know any of the fellows there. Went for a walk into Weymouth &amp; around the Promenade round the beach.  Weymouth is rather a large <strike>town</strike> quite pretty &amp; old town. I feel very down hearted after coming back from furlough.</p>
<p>Sunday May 27th<br/>Rained rather heavy during this morning. Very muddy on the parade ground. Went to Church service in the Y.M.C.A. this morning. Doing Mess orderly today, two are appointed every day, also a hut orderly.</p>
