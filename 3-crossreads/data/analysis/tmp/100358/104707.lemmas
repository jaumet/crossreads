 had to take the opportun to tear themselv away while the girl was unconsci . I saw in the dim light mani a man give his pack a determin hitch , toss his head walk brisk , through he wharf gate on to the wharf . Inside the wharf , with the dismal scene behind us we sat the men down and await perhap the most dismal dawn of mani of these men 's live . Some of the singl inde some of the marri men too , were glorious drunk , and they gave a lot of troubl . A tough harden littl man who for week was our Sergeant 's Mess order hail me from his posit in the seat line . He was sit on his pack with his head on his hand . " Sergeant " ! So I came over and said " Well Bill it 's a dismal busi , hope the wife took it well ? " " By Christ Sergeant " he said " I can say good bye to the missus , but the kiddi clung like glue ? by the live Christ I near squib it dinkum . " He was overflow with tear and was show an affect you could n't credit some of these lad with . So I just said to myself ? well Bill Holman , you ?r a man at the bottom of your soul , although you have a dirti tongu and you can show your Sergeant mani an old soldier 's trick . But there 's a lot wors than you . We embark alright and the crowd were let onto the wharf about 8 a.m. , just as we commenc to draw out from the wharf . Streamer were thrown and the same sad hopeless scene commenc all over again . I never want to see so mani hopeless despair women face again . It is an apparit still , and alway will be . Ruben 's represent of Dant 's " Pergatorio" is a mere instanc besid it . Well , perhap the men go now have a heavier task to face than those who hurri away befor our big casualti list start to remind the public of the dead earnest of this campaign . We left Sydney harbour
