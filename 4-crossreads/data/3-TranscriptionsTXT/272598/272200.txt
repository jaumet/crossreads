photos from Amiens.
Saturday 23.6.17Granted a days leave to Amiens but failed to take advantage of it.  Walked to Albert about 4 miles, spent a few hours there & came back by Coal waggon to Millencourt & walked from there to camp.  Great improvement in Albert; becoming more populated daily.  Received mail 22 & 29 April from home on my return.  Weilded the willow for an hour or so at night.  Four more went to Blighty on leave.
Sunday 24.6.17Wrote my usual weekly letters. Played cricket in evening
Monday 25.6.17Mixed up by Orderly officer on early
