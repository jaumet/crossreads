1917 Monday 28 May
See the Orderly Officer with view to get me taken off my job. Sees the W.O. Eddington - a miserable beer soaked cad. Get what I want & put on general duties not back to my old job. After tea go with Radford into Boulogne book seats for self & Mac for "Madam Butterfly" 5 francs. Stroll on Plage & enjoy watching French people --- the fog cloud
