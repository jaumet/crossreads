<p>After fooling about a great deal all thoughts have been put out of our head of leaving for England, &amp; although I have heard from good authority that in ten days time we shall go to England, the general opinion seems to be that we shall not go at all.<br/>They have been picking out groups of men for various jobs in Egypt, such as details to the Light Horse.<br/>This will probably go on till we leave, so that if only we are not picked for such jobs, we stand a good chance</p>
