Friday July 27thAnother chap out of the store has shifted into Hut 28 with me, so I have company now. We have a fairly good mess here, of course the food is better than in the huts. All the old rubbish imaginable is being shifted round to my hut. It makes ones heart ache to look at it. It is being brought in from the other huts.
Saturday July 28thStill the old rubbish comes. A couple of the huts were found to be lousy, so we have to change all the blankets, bed boards, tressels etc, a days work in itself. Not feeling too good today. There has been a lot of gambling going on since pay day, there generally is a lot, but this pay breaks the record I think.
Sunday July 29thSunday is generally a quiet day. Done my washing this morning, I make it a point to do it always on a Sunday morning. Raining all this afternoon so could not go out anywhere. Stopped at home & had a good sleep. Answered a couple of letters I received through the week. Five marched in this evening, from Australia.
