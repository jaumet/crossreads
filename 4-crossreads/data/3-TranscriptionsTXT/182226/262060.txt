Monday 7 February, 1916
Sadness in the tucker line. Dinner 11/2 biscuits each, 1 tin of jam between 11 men & 1 pannican of tea. (Indigestion is very scarce in this camp)
Another aeroplane came over today & scouted round for about half & hour.
The railway is right up to us now & timber & matting is beginning to come in for the trenches.
We had our tea tonight listening to the strains of music produced by the band. We would rather have them put a little more sugar in the tea or make it an extra tin of jam per day if they are trying to make our meals more pleasant; music is so unsatisfactory as an item of your diet.
