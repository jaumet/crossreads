  
 Monday 1 April After comfortable trip arrived London about 8.20 a.m. Had breakfast, obtained seats for Opera. Finished morning at tailors getting tunic altered. 
 Afternoon with Bert to Hampstead Heath where the Cockneys had their Easter Monday 'alf 'oliday. Very funny & peculiar. Weather wet &. many of the holiday makers returned early. 
 Tea at Central Hall, Then to Opera Aida. Simply glorious. Absolutely the best I have ever heard. 
 Home late.
