<p>various buildings which are famous etc, most of them so probably because they look as if they are liable to fall down at any time.  Had dinner at Gattos &amp; as the Captain didn't feel well he went home.  He has not been too well for some time.  I then went &amp; had a look about with myself &amp; a walking stick &amp; a cigar &amp; as no one looked as if they would like to come to the Theatre with us, we went to the Gaiety, where Tonights the Night is being staged by George Edwardes.  It is a musical comedy &amp; I enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>July 24th  Have had no time for diary since July 6th so I will just give a short account of my doings as we leave on the 26th (Monday).  Stayed at the Imperial Hotel after a few days of arriving &amp; had a nice time there.  It is a fine Hotel in Russel Square &amp; a lot of Australians stay there.  Have visited the Tower of London &amp; saw the Crown Jewells &amp; the places where a lot of our old Kings &amp; Queens &amp; other Royalties of the good old days were beheaded.</p>
<p>Saw Madame Tussauds Waxworks which are indeed the last thing in that direction.  Went to Daly's Theatre, "Betty", Globe, Peg, o' My Heart", Wyndhams, Gamblers all., Empire, Watch Your Step., Palladium, Vaudeville., Holborn Empire, Vaudeville., &amp; the London Hippodrome a Revue.  Also one or two smaller shows.  Also had one or two Motor drives around London.  Also visited Regents Park Gardens on a Sunday, having obtained a "Fellows" order.  They are great too &amp; are the best Zoological gardens to be seen anywhere I am told.  Anyway I know they are bigger than ours in Sydney, so they are &ndash; well &ndash; Zoological gardens alright.  On Sunday the 18th I visited Mrs Henderson</p>
