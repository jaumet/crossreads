Jly 28th '17 :- During the past
week our Brigade has
been acting as Duty
Brigade of the Division,
consequently we have
had a good deal
of reconnaissance work
to do capturing a
few prisoners during the
week. Today our Regt.
moved off from the
Brigade camp, situated
about 11/2 miles S.E of
Tel-el-Fara, & took over
three redoubts further
round on the flank.
These are man every night.
