<p>9 November 1914<br/>Monday Late King Edwards Birthday</p>
<p>After another hot night rose anything but refreshed at 7.00 we received an SOS from Cocos Island that an enemy's warship had put in and was threatning the place the Sydney immediately left soon engaged enemy at 9 fighting was rather severe &amp; after an hours fighting the Emden as she turned out to be had to be beached to prevent her from sinking all funnels were blown off &amp; front mast gone by the board, casualties also were extremely heavy, the Sydney then set out for the Collico &amp; caught her took off the crew &amp; sank her  She then returned to Cocos Island &amp; found that the Emden had landed a party who destroyed the wireless &amp; cut the cables the Sydney then took off the crew [indecipherable] a few more shells into her &amp; sailed for Colombo after putting in an excelent days work. Two horses died during day &amp; another chap on the Euripides making the 4th  Toby progressing tiptop &amp; will be out in a day or two  Bed at 10</p>
<p>10 November 1914<br/>Tuesday 3 weeks out from Meblourne</p>
<p>Revielle at 5.15<br/>The nigs have been rousing us out at 5 to wash decks &amp; consequently we are losing more sleep. No news of the Sydney or her doings had come to hand till 4 oclock when the official report was published. The Sydney got out of the scrap without a casualty &amp; is badly riddled like a sieve. The Jap &amp; the Melbourne have been consoling themselves as to their bad luck, but they only did their duty. Horses still continue to die &amp; we have now lost 14 Another [indecipherable] on the Medic also passed away &amp; another fell overboard from the New Zealand boat &amp; up to yet we haven't heard if he has been picked up or not that makes 5 lost during voyage. Stables was quite a transformation &amp; a pleasure today for we only had one loss &amp; that made all the difference. A hair mash with a decoxion of Epsom salts had to be mixed &amp; Teddy &amp; I did it, it was rather a hot job &amp; one sweated like the horses. Fed up at 7 oclock then retired</p>
