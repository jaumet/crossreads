<p>13/1/16<br/>Ah lis! Yalla Yallah! &ndash; Chanty<br/>Or -- --<br/>For Chorus Ah lis</p>
<p>Bringing stampers down on early parade the sky presented a most extraordinary striped appearance with sweeps of ominous clouds right across. Did artillery formation and then an attack with the non.coms.  Pedler returned with LeCaire I go tomorrow morning taking Spendlove with me Mitchell being still in hospital. Unless my box arrives this morning I shall have to borrow decent clothes to wear up there.</p>
<p>Stayed in at office all day. During the morning a troop train passed through with much cheering probably new Australians arriving from Suez. More mail coming to hand gradually received a fair number today. Before dusk took a walk down to station passed all the different battalions in order and saw the 6th Field Artillery disentraining. Just past Brigade a cinema show is being erected by natives. The 8 &frac12; is in the hands of a contractor allowing a rebate of 2/- a man per month in conson. of getting the business. Lappas allowed 4/- per man rebate &ndash; an instance of the business morality here.</p>
<p>In preparation for Cairo trip gathered up sufficient clothes to turn out smartly. Breeches &amp; puttees from Bird also shirt &amp; tunic from Sparrow. My own clothes are awful. Sgt De Boos in this afternoon. Turned in about 2200 &amp; read till late.</p>
