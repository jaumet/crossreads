 "A" Company No 6 Officer Cadet Battn Balliol College Oxford 31st December 1916 
 . . . . . "Wasn't it a great pity about poor Fred Phillips.  I said Goodbye to him on the 1st November in the trenches on the Somme opposite Bapaume, our Battalion was being relieved that night to have a sleep as we had not had one for four days. 
 On the 4th November our Battalion attacked at midnight, in the rain, a strong point about 600 yards away &ndash; it was bristling with machine guns &amp; our Battalion was driven back four times, the last seen of Fred as far as I can gather, was that he was wounded &amp; bandaging one of his own machine gunners 40 yards from the German trenches,"
