 France 22/4/16 
 Dear Alice  I received your very welcome letter dated 10/1/16 yesterday and I was very pleased to hear from you, and to know that you were all well. Well I got over the mumps alright and rejoined the Battalion and we came over here we had a great trip across but I was sea sick from Alexandria to Malta but from Malta to Marseilles I enjoyed the trip the only thing it was a bit cold but that is nothing. We were taken for a march through the principal places in Marseilles and then we got on the train and it took us 56 hours to get to our destination but we did not mind as we got tea, coffee and rations all the way and we quite enjoyed the trip as there is some lovely scenery in the South of France and the weather is nice and warm compared to here. We are all billeted over here in shed, barns and houses etc. and we get plenty of clean straw to sleep on and we can buy eggs and bread or anything we want and the Y.M. C.A. has coffee and cakes so we can get it at cost price.
