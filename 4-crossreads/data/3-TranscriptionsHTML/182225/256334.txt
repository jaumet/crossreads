<p>Fine &amp; warm. I was on Medical Officers fatigue,&mdash; had to scrub the bathrooms ect. The rest of the battery went for a route march of about twelve miles &amp; came home very tired. Some guns came for us &amp; the horses are coming soon. Warren was over in evening. He says they are working them very hard over there, but they are learning something</p>
