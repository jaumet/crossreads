<p>I am also picking up a little Arabic from the niggers here; give them cigarettes and they will teach you by the hour &ndash; they all call me "Tawheales" which means big one.<br/>I think Rostron is going on to England; he has been jolly sick here but I think the trip will do him good.<br/>I suppose it will be your birthday in a couple of days "old copper top".  Many happy returns of it.<br/>The other day, under registered parcel, I sent home a statuette of a horse in quartz crystal on a marble stand &ndash; when you see it write and let me know what you think of it.<br/>The films I am sending you are really very badly developed, they have spilt stuff all over them - Must go and get dressed now.<br/>Has not the war news been good lately!  It looks like the beginning of the end.<br/>Love to Aunt Katie &ndash; I wrote to Father on Sunday but forgot to number his letter.<br/>Had my photo taken yesterday along side a 6 ft. 6in. man just to show you I was not as big as I looked.<br/>Hope to get my mail this afternoon. My word it will be good.<br/>Be good sonnies me boys.<br/>Rob.<br/>That looks professional!</p>
