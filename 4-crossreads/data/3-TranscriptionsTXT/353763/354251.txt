The drawing room has all grass & cane furniture  -  At present it must be a white elephant - some 60 guests only since May it is reported & it wont have many with this war on & routes not safe  -
The usual gossip & jollity at tea time & so on till 5.40 when I cleared for my boat  -  Horsfall & 2 others medicos walked down with me & I met other officers & off we went  -  The Captain (Moore) & another officer (P) came off about 6  - 30 & both got into trouble with the commander (Stoker)  -  S is really boss of the whole show when aboard  -  Both Captain & the other chaps not too sober & then late in spite of Orders  -  Stoker rounded them up pretty severely I am glad to say  -  The men on AE2 got shore leave & had to back by 5 pm & every man was there sober & sensible  -  We are so linked up - officers & men - that while we know them> they know us  -  Submarine men cant think much I grant you
