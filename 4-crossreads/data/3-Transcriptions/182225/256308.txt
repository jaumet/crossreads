<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; SATURDAY 8&nbsp;&nbsp; JULY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny but very cold in morning &amp; evening. We sighted three torpeado boats in morning early &amp; they came up full speed &amp; each took a boat under its care at once and the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; went back. As soon as we got our torpedo boat each we each went as hard as we could&nbsp; The &quot;Marathon&quot; went straight to the front and stayed there then the &quot;Benalla&quot; then us &amp; the &quot;Beltana&quot; last. We had a full dress parade in morning and the final of the boxing in afternoon, there were no good spars. Had a concert after the boxing but it was no good. They took collections for a few of the crew who had done little things for us &amp; got a good amount for them. Expect to get to England tomorrow afternoon.</p>
