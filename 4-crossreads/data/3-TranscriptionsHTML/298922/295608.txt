<p>Monday 5th November 1917</p>
<p>Posted notes yesterday &amp; left London at 4 p.m. for Southampton. <u>Did not</u> leave London &amp; am likely to be blocked for several days. Laura arrived &amp; had dinner with us so I at least saw her but am anxious to get away now that all arrangements are made.</p>
<p>Cold pretty rotten still so a few days won't be amiss here, Australasians arrived safely.</p>
