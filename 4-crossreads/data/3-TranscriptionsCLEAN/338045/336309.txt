from our usual work & given something to do to fill in time, & some of the new comers from Egypt, take our places.  Our time here is about at an end & this I find to be right, as Capt. Mackay informs we are at last to go (in a few days) to London or Etaples (in France, Australian Base Camp, to proceed to the front) which is not known.  This is the end of my transfer but at least, when I arrive in London, shall make further attempts, if to Etaples, shall be sent to the front.  Great news to-day, another Zeppelin brought down in England.  Evening at home.
