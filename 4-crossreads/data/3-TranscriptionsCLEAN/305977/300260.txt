  
 20 Turks rushed part of the trench held by the 1st Battalion with bombs & killed & wounded a few.  One Turk a tremendous big fellow got into the trench & got into grips with one of the sergeants.  Some other assisted & held him down & another shot him.  He had 4 loaves of bread & 2 bottles of water  There was a good deal of bombing & shortly after dark 4 of the 5th LH got struck with a bomb one getting his arm & leg broken.  I went on at 9 oclock but it was fairly quiet then.  Came off at 11 & went on again from 3 till 5 am. 
 Sunday 5th [Sept] Had a quiet day in the support trenches.  There is not much chance of sleeping as there are so many men in the trenches.  We sat about & smoked & yarned & discussed whether John Turk would make his proposed attack.  Anyway we got a big supply of bombs handy
