 1917 Sunday 25 March A beauti bright sunni day . Such a welcom chang to the cold bleak one we ve had . One could almost imagin himself back in dear old sunni N.S.W. Tini finch are appear in the brake hedg chirp of the advent of Spring the sky-lark are actual carol high up out of sight in the clear air of the morn as I write . Is the grim struggl go on in all it intens but a few mile away ? Yes ! one can hear the dull boom of gun , that can onli bear one interpret , the tireless air scout are buzz overhead in their bright aluminium cage . Purpos visit Toni this afternoon but find it is pay day also there is to be a memori servic in memori of poor Bill Parson tonight .
