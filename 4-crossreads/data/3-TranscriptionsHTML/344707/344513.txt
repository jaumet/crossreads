<p>how the infantry ever got here because some of the hills are so steep that you have to crawl up to the trenches.<br/>We granted the enemy an 8 hours armistice the other day and I was in charge of one of the burial parties.<br/>The ground in front of our trench was litterally covered with dead Turks &amp; the sight &amp; smell was simply awful.<br/>The Turks charged on several occasions and were simply mowed down by our fire. They even got into our trenches in places but did not live long there.<br/>If they are sending any more men over you had better try and send Thomas.<br/>The weather here has been simply glorious and we are all living in dugouts in the side of the hills. That is when we are not in the firing line. We went straight into the trenches when we arrived and remained there for [indecipherable].<br/>They have no horses here but [indecipherable] pack mules.<br/>We are allowed to go down to the beach at times for a swim and it is always very acceptable.<br/>It was reported this morning that Roy Hor had died from wounds, but I would not like say for sure.  Old C.F. Cox was wounded through the leg and Bridges has died from wounds. Time and paper is precious here so will have to say adieu and will hope to see you with us soon<br/>Kind regards<br/>J.J. McMillan</p>
