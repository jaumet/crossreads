<p>Saturday, 6 January 1917</p>
<p>El Arish</p>
<p>Still raining one gets nearly dry by midday only to get wet at night. The country here is better than nearer the Canal, 1000s of acres of wheat have been planted in the Sand &amp; Fig Trees are everywhere.</p>
<p>Well water can be got at about 12 feet &amp; pretty good at that. No grass only edible bush that camels graze on. My notes are scribbled in all places &amp; bear their gypsy begetting, but if they are of interest to you &amp; afire others I am well repaid.</p>
<p>Had a wash in the sea &ndash; cold - 1000s of Gypsy <u>Egyptians I suppose</u> labourers are building the Railway &amp; the Station is just being formed. 1st TRAIN tomorrow.</p>
