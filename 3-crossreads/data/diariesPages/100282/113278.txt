This morning the Battn went for a bath we wanted it badly.
Rained again last night things are very sloppy again.
It has been raining off on all day long the ground is in an awful state I can see a rotten time when we go in the line next time. Am Battn orderly Sgt tonight it is a rotten job for we are supposed to have no lights at all in the Camp I have to see that it is carried out.
Have been doing a lot of writing this afternoon.
13th Been raining pretty well all day things have been fairly miserable Howard Dimock I went into Poperinghe to get our woolly locks cut last night coming home I trod like a big mug into a big pool of water.
Yesterday I received a little parcel from Mitchells.
14th You should have seen the tiny parade at Church this morning, easy to see the Battalion has been severely handled, it was the smallest parade I have ever seen.
