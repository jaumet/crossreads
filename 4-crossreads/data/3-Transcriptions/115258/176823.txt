<p>is from a cracked plate. The photo of the painting of the Kaiser was taken by one of the F.C. officers and is on the dome of the German church on the Mt of Olives. The officer told me that the next painting on the right of the Kaiser is one of Christ. Enclosed are 15 snaps which I took on the Jerusalem Jerico stunt - it was cloudy all the time so the photos are not good. The Mt of Temptation is a very high hill just in from Jerico and there is a very pretty Green monastery build half way up its sides, there was a wind mill right on top but they are building a church there now. The turks used it as an observation post and had a telephone up there. About half way between the bottom of the hill and the monastery are some caves and in these were a very nice family of refugees from Jerico. They owned the hotel in Jerico and the turks had taken it over for a hospital - they could not speak English but they were Christians and so different from the sneaking Arabs. The family group photo is taken on a path on the side of the mountain. The photos of Jerusalem I took when I was in there on leave. Took some photos from plane but not developed yet. We are up in the hills again now</p>
