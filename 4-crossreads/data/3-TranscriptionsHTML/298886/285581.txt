<p>to a place called Hod Es Sagia "Somewhere in the desert". All during the early morning a very thick white fog enveloped everything making it impossible to see further ahead than about 100 yards. Reached our bivouac about 7 AM. We are surprizing the enemy at dawn at a place called Bir El Magreiba about 7 miles away. We are working in conjunction with the 2nd A.LH Brigade who are going out on a reconnaissance in the Ogratina and Bir el Abd districts</p>
<p>Anniversary of attack on Quinns post</p>
<p>1st July Sat. Hod-Es Sagia.</p>
<p>We mounted and moved out at 2 AM. The usual silent night march and just at dawn we came upon the place but nothing doing their spy system is too perfect although there were plenty of footprints recently made - in the sand. Did a lot of Heliograph work at long distance, good practice</p>
<p>Also made sketches which have to be handed into Brigade office Came back to Hod Es Sagia about 11 oclock AM.</p>
<p>Burned several native villages causing great smoke &amp; blaze.</p>
