<p>26<br/>It, and yet was hollow and unsatisfied as a leviathan feeding on sprats.</p>
<p>It is now the 27 June and we have crossed the English Channel.</p>
<p>Are now almost in the harbour of Havre</p>
<p>It is a gorgeous sunny day, with picture clouds</p>
<p>Silver-green seas</p>
<p>Faint pearl haze</p>
<p>We can see the cliffs and their colors, and the grass and trees of the land.</p>
<p>Buildings are quite plain. Windows and doors appear like square dots, if you can imagine such shapes.</p>
<p>Everything is nearer every minute and planier</p>
<p>Love to you dear wife and to our children<br/>And to you dear mother<br/>Am in splendid spirits and well.  All is well and will remain well with me.  God Bless you all</p>
