<p>and loose herrings in the boats wherever one looked, the place just seemed to be one vast fish mart. how many loads had been carted away before we arrived I dont know but while we were there the carters were busy all the time taking the boxes away as fast as they could.   I had fresh herrings for supper that night before we went back to camp.   the journey up in the train next day was like all journeys per rail over here at this time of year, slow and tiresome we arrived at Bn. about 6 p.m. and hunted up the Coy. reported then looked for a place to sleep. next day the old routine commenced so there is no need to say more re my doings since rejoining the coy.   No need for me to say anything Re Harry for I have no doubt that he will by now have told you first hand about his six days trip to France, and what he saw and heard during that time.   There is no need to worry any about my ear troubles for I hope that they will be none the worse for gunfire when we get back up the line again, of course if shells start dropping round too close they may be affected again.   the one that did the damage before was only a few feet away from my head in the edge of the trench and how the pieces managed to miss us, is one of the things hard to understand, still its wonderful how close a shell can drop to a bunch of men without doing any damage especially when the ground is soft.   The Rheurimatisn also has not troubled me lately, I'm glad to say.   Perhaps it is because I've not had time to think</p>
