B.
We went up in a Motor Transport which was going up to our old C.C.S. for our gear.
After having dinner in our Old C.C.S. a place that is now most disreputable, we made our way to Bailleul. When we entered the town instead of seeing the large crowd of people that we usually saw in this town, their was scarcely a person to be seen. A few M.P.s and a number of reinforcements resting in the square, was about all the people that were there. The town was terrible smashed about, scarcely a whole house standing and the old Belfry which stood in the square stood a mass of ruins with the debris at the foot, and the face of the old clock lying on the top of the debris. A huge shell has also gone through the roof of the large church, smashing all the beautiful stained glass windows
Visited the farm on our way back Missed the last transport, but we were lucky to get on an extra one which took us back to Hondegheim, without having accomplished the quest that we had gone into Bailleul for.
Went to the Cinema in the Village which is run by the YMCA. A very good show indeed
