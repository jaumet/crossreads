<p>March 1917<br/>(6th continued)   a "Minniewerfa" lobbed on the material we had for the other to &amp; blew it to blazes, in fact we could not find even a part of it after.  We finished work about 2.30 A.M. &amp; made our way back along the sap, which in places was only about 18" deep &amp; continually swept by Fritz's machine guns.   I eventually arrived back at the Farm about 5 o'clock this morning, fagged out.<br/>The section (N.4) received orders this morning to move on with all gear to "Embassy Lane."  I slept all the morning &amp; proceeded on this afternoon arriving about tea time.</p>
