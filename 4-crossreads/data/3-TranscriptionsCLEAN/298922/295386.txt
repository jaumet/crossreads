 Am posting you a "VIVE PARISIENNE" paper you will perhaps smile at some of the Broad Jokes but this is the paper the SOLDIERS all buy in France & here & is the best French lesson possible. 
 Did Patrols today & 2 Lectures on Dismounted Attacks such as through the scrub on Gallipoli - war news better - my notes will be useful for future reference. 
 Went to Remount Depot to see Col. McLeish but he was out. Heliopolis is very deserted now. Glorious weather and neck alright.
