  
 I did my bit & then arranged with one of those guarding other goods to look after mine. 
 I managed to get some Post cards, nuts etc and did a little buying off the celebrated "Bum" Boats which can even be found at Embros. 
 Thursday 4th Nov 1915 Did further buying to-day and managed to secure a few more items. It looked like rain & QMS Maclaren who I had chumed in with decided to leave next day by trawler but I was inclined to stay another day. How I am to get all my cases away I don't know. The task for one man is an impossible one
