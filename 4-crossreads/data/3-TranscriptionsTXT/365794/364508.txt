Tuesday 16th April 1917 [1918]Better news from the Western Front, we are still holding on though things desperate.  In view of this all petty troubles in Choubra vanish pro tem but it is a lonely time, not the being alone but not feeling strong enough to battle & not a kind word as all too busy? & I feel too depressed to be gay.A very kind letter again from J.M. Andrews at H.Q., nice boy.No trace of the M.O. today but as am only a sister not an officer this is not strange.S. Leed comes very kindly - brings sewing & flowers.Pulse is now 60 & is a fair indication (in one sense) of my depressed feelings but am learning & I hope going to remember some of the little things read & seen while at "Choubra Military Infectious".
