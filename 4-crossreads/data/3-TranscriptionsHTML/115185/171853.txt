<p>woman. I like her very much.<br/>Her brother has just been killed &ndash; it's a sad world but she is so busy with managing us that I think she hasn't much time to think. I have enquired if Col. Bob Owen is in a hospital here &amp; can't trace him &ndash; perhaps he is at Cairo or gone on the England &ndash; we are now going to the danger zone. Archie is there. I hope he will not go on the peninsular till I have seen him. The officers on the Themistocles in Charge of the troops were most gracious to<br/>us &ndash; such fine men. The Officer commanding cavalry man had been at Mons. He gave us all considerations in rose when we left the table at dinner. And the last evening on ship &ndash; asked us to wait and hear the toasts we were toasted. The officers standing on our chairs &amp; all toasts were said. <u>Ladies and</u> gentlemen &ndash; we need not have left that ship but we didn't know Col. Fiaschi would be ready so soon for us and it went on two days ago &ndash; with our kind friends.</p>
