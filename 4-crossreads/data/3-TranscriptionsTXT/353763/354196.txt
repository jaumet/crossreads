 About 4 pm a party of us went on shore &amp; directed our steps to China Town  -  Immediately opposite the thousand foot pier where we land &ndash; facing the sea is the steep talus of the edge of this crater &ndash; which by the way must be at least a mile &amp; a half across &ndash; a huge crater &ndash; the sea came in from the South &amp; flooded it  -  At the back of the talus rise two high cones &ndash; close together  -  They rise from the same base  -  The higher must be close on 2700 feet &amp; is known as 'Die Mutter'  -  We have a signalling station on top which looks far out to sea  - 
 [drawing] Once in China Town I had an objective &amp; that was a barber shop  -  I found a friendly Chinaman &amp; he volunteered to show me the barber s  I left the party &amp; went off on my own  -  Came by a Japanese place &amp; presently was in a chair &amp; a Jap about half my age was cutting my hair very close with clippers  -  Very close  -  I made him take it  -  I detest very much the unkempt look of longhaired men  -  A close cropped head is a clean cool head &amp; though it may not add to beauty yet it certainly makes its owner look smart &amp; clean  -  Our party laughed at me but I can recommend the cut in tropical &amp; hot lands  -
