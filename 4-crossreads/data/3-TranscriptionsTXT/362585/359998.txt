 France 6.3.17 
 My dear Mrs. Ferguson, 
 Just received a parcel containing 2 pairs of socks and this addressed envelope.  Thank you very much. 
 I am in splendid health and condition and have had quite a good time lately.  I have been jumping about from C.O. to second in command &amp; back again ever since I came back.  At present I am second in command.  I have not got any promotion yet but it may be along any minute now. 
 The ground is again very sloppy.  We had a lot of snow a couple of days ago followed by a quick thaw and the place is in a lovely state. 
 Rations have been splendid and Canteen delicacies fairly easily obtainable. 
 Parcels have been coming along in close column of platoons (you'll have to get someone to tell you what that means) and altogether I am feeling quite optimistic and cheerful.  I think our side is winning.  Fritz is having a Rotten time here. 
 Best love, yours  sincerely  affectionately C.R.Lucas
