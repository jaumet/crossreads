88 wks of soldiering
Revielle as usual.
Just the same old routine, nothing new only that we probably may stay in this hell for another 3 months shelters for both men horses they are to be erected straight away, so all signs of a move is misfish. 
The service is to be broken up today each regt on the new basis is issued with 4 waggons which are permanently attached men also the Bde train does not now exist, the Div supplies all that, the late drivers of our train have been left in the mud now are transferring to the artillery engineers. Glasgow is also finding positions for them, he is still in Heliopolis; Cyril Tonkins fell down two flights of stairs yesterday when visiting friends broke his leg in two places, he's always in for any bad luck that's running.
Expect mail tomorrow. Bed 10.10
