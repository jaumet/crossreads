<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 7.8.16<br/>14th June 1916.</p>
<p>My dearest Daddy,<br/>A few days ago I received two letters from you,- one General Letter dated 10th of April &amp; one 17th Apl enclosing a booklet.  To-day I have just received two more from you dated 9th &amp; 16th of April.  Thank you so much for the very interesting news in them, for the advice re smoking etc &amp; for the general comfort I got from them.  By the same mail as I received your first two-mentioned letters I received one from Ol (from on board the Medina) dated 11.4.16, one from Mother, &amp; one from Millie Jones.  As soon as I had finished reading them I took them over to Walter.  He was delighted to get the latest news from home &amp; from Chatswood South, as his own letters were delayed on account of his joining up his Company.<br/>Walter went into the trenches on Monday last. I saw quite a lot of him last week; I went out to where he was receiving special instruction in a certain part of warfare, &amp; was quite sorry when he moved.  It has been very wet &amp; sloppy here for the last week, &amp; Wal will get his first</p>
