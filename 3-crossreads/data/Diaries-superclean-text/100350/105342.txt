(18) Arrived at "Flesselles" at 2.30A.M this morning after a very cold weary ride, the distance we travelled was only 23 miles but the Puff-Puff took a little over 5 hours to do the journey (going some) we marched about a mile from the Station were billeted, some of the billets were very good, but the majority were up to "Putty". However the boys were glad of anywhere to lie down.
(19) Very cold morning. Parades etc were gone through. Snow fell again to day.
(20) Sunshine to day, place looks a wee bit brighter. Leave granted to a large number of men to visit City of "Amiens"
(24) Sgt Hooker and myself took a trip into the City of "Amiens" this morning, it was well worth the walk to see the famous Cathedral, it is a splendid building. Of course the French folk have placed sand bags around many parts of it for protection against shell splinters. Met 2 of my old comrades form the 13th Bn Sgt Phil Adams Doig. 
(27) Paid a visit to "Berteaucourt" and met some folk who gave us such a good time when we were billeted there last July.
