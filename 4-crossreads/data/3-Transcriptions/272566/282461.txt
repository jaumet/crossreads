<p>Thursday 18 January</p>
<p>Managed to get a stretcher to sleep on last night.  Snow was falling when we awoke this morning and it continued all day.  We marched out from Becordel soon after 10 a.m. and reached Bernafay Wood at 1 p.m.  On all sides snow is about 6 inches deep.  This time we are to be quartered in Bow Huts which we built last month when here before.</p>
