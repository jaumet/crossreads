<p>that the Bgde was moving out with all haste &amp; the situation would be cleared before dark. At 1600 Lieut J.D.Macansh MC was sent into Ziza to inform the Turkish Commandant that in the event of our not moving in before dark he must keep his trenches manned.</p>
<p>Throughout the day we were surrounded by Arabs &amp; Bedouins. They kept enquiring whether the Turks had surrendered. They maintained that if sol they should be allowed to enter the position &amp; take the rifles. If the Turks had not surrendered they desired us to attack at once promising assistance. Several times during the day they moved forward, but were immediately driven back by Turkish Machine gun &amp; Rifle fire. At 1600 Col Cameron sent a message by the Arabs to the Bedouins gathering around the position to the effect that if they attempted to attack the Turks He would attack them. This had the desired effect &amp; they began to withdraw although throughout the day the situation appeared at times somewhat critical. Fortunately our men did not fire one shot at the Bedouins. At 1715 the Divisional Commander arrived by Motor car at our Sgdn. In company with a Turkish officer Col Cameron immediately proceeded to the Hqtrs of the Commandant of Ziza, &amp; after some delay the Turkish Commandant was induced to leave Ziza &amp; visit the Divisional Commander. He expressed the greatest concern with regard to the Turkish Garrison particularly the sick &amp; wounded.</p>
