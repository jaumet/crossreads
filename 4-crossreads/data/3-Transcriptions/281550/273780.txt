<p><u>May</u></p>
<p>Thursday May the 29th<br/>These last few days we have had some rather severe Monsoon weather, The sea has been very rough and the rain has been frequently very sharp and heavy.</p>
<p>This morning we entered the harbour of Colombo and 11am.  The Cruiser Sydney and Supply ship Platypus, with four of the surrendered submarines were in the harbour when we arrived. No sooner had we anchored, than we were besieged by native bumboats. These craft are very pecular, they have an outrigger attachment secured to one side to protect them from capsizing, while the boat proper, consists of a portion of a tree trunk hollowed out, with just enough room for one native and a box or two of silks or imitation jewelry.</p>
