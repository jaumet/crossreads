I see Rose & Liza Montgomery have been down for another visit.  They will not be as young this time as the last.
Two months have gone since your last letter, Dad, and now it is down to 8 months before you can give as much lip as possible.  I suppose you have made some plans for the future, for I cannot imagine you sitting down doing nothing.  For instance. Mr. Christie's success might have made you a bit curious, and you might be thinking of going in for some fowls too.  I'm told that it looks as if land down Jervis Bay - way is likely to prove a good spec in the future.  You might keep your eye on this spot.  It would not be hard to blossom out into a land speculator.  Anyhow, Dad, think it over and drop me a line as to your intentions.  It's no good waiting until you are retired before you start thinking.  Start now.  And I hope the old pepper and salt helps you along in the idea of being prosperous yet.
