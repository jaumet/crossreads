<p>28.9.18<br/>The officers of the H.M.T. Malwa came on board today &amp; told us that they had sighted 2 periscopes 18 hours out from Taranto bound to Port Said full of troops. A torpedoe struck the Malwa &amp; failed to explode. She was dock at Taranto the following trip &amp; the plates were dented badly. They fired 3 shots from their howitzer &amp; they claim to have caused the distruction of one . The depth charge at 500 yards range exploded below the serface a few feet away from the periscope. The Jap distroyers 2  made for them &amp; claim to have sunk another with their hugh depth charges. The Malwa's last shot fired took a long time to explode &amp; consequently one of Jap. distroyers steaming at high speed got so near that part of the bomb actually landed on their forecastle head. After wards they lowered a boat from the distroyers &amp; actually picked up a torpedoe that had hit the Malwa &amp; failed to go off</p>
