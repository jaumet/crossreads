for some fruit, & these suited us down to the ground, I saw an Egyptian fox one day prowling round one of the canals, they are not so red as the fox as we know being of a darker colour & smaller they have a bonzer brush. New Year's Day was very cloudy & dusty here, the sand being of a different color to Mena.I got quite a swag of parcels here one day, from all over the place .My arm was getting pretty crook again from the effects of the cuts from the bomb in Lone Pine" so I went to the Dr for the first time since enlisting that was a good record wasn't it he sent me to hospital for he said a spell would do me no harm
