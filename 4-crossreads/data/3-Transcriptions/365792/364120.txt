<p>15 Nov<br/>2 or 3 miles out &amp; ditto back Dont feel too good. Marched a couple of miles to dinner (a mile each way). The chaps shot fairly well. Made the pace a welter coming back, had a good shower &amp; a 2 course tea. Stew &amp; rice &amp; prunes. Not bad eh? Feel a little tired.</p>
<p>16 Slept well. Out at 6 am Range again today. Feeling rather tired Good dinner Salmon, tinned sausages &amp; pears, &amp; bread. We may go to Suez Canal as there is fighting there. Left Range about 3.30. Shooting fairly good.</p>
<p>17 Out again at 6 am. Range party fell in at 7.30, but I nutted off. No good to this chick marching 6 miles with crook feet. Not on your life! Cleaned out sleeping hut. Dinner at YMCA then went Cairo to Soldiers Club &amp; Gardens. Loafed about until 7 pm.</p>
<p>18 Am Mess Orderly today &amp; its a dead easy job, about 10 minutes work at each meal More reinforcements came in last night. Good looking lot too. Pay day today. Cool &amp; windy. Met 2 more Uralla boys at dinner time. Dick Ryan</p>
