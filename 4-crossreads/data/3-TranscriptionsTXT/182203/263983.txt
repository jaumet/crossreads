plenty of invitations but cannot accept half of them. The Officers are vey kind &  all seem very anxious to give us a little pleasure.We are still having very warm weather but this morning it is a little cooler & nice breeze blowing. The sun is fearfully hot &  one cannot think of going out before 4 or 5. p.m.  I'm off duty this morning, so have been busy repacking my trunk, in case I have to move on somewhere, in an hour's notice.Dr. Mc.Lean from Williamstown is here but not doing our ward. I have seen him once or twice. Poor Major Wells (he came with us) is very upset at poor Sister Bicknell's death. He & Dr. Mc.Lean of  Queensland were at the funeral  & they have both been very good to us. Matron Bell was fearfully worried & is very sad, she did all she could to save poor Bick. It is a great surprise to me at the way she looks after us, she has been very kind to all of us but she is not very happy, it is a very trying place for a woman like her.
