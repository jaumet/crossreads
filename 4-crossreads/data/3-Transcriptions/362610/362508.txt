<p>Thursday 19 October 1916<br/>Dull, &amp; wet. Intermittent showers throughout the day &amp; everything underfoot was in a filthy state. After lunch biked in to Division on business &amp; was fortunate enough to meet Leo there, carrying a bag of coal up to their mess. This was at Tilques. Thence rode on to St Omer &amp; got one or two things I needed from Ordnance, afterwards having a fairly stiff ride home against a head wind, &amp; arriving abt. 6.30. A frost at night, the first I have seen this season.</p>
