<p>a snow storm. Saw Birdwood strolling up the road yarning to the chaps. The roads were all frozen hard &amp; very slippery it taking us about an hour to get up one hill. The horses find it difficult to keep their feet even while walking much less pulling a load. Our division is now being relieved by the 2nd but so far have not met Morris.</p>
<p>Friday 22nd December.<br/>More rain during the last three days &amp; roads becoming soupy again. Fritz bombarded all round us on Wednesday &amp; blew up some huts killing &amp; wounding several. He kept it up all day sweeping the whole area of the valley &amp; cutting the railway at one point. Next day Morris's batt. arrived &amp; I followed him up &amp; had a good long yarn. I brought him back to camp &amp; gave him some socks, comforters &amp; a sheepskin. Our bearers have now gone back &amp; we follow tomorrow having spent a month in this delectable spot.</p>
