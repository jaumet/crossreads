Mayence
Oppenheim. Now ran right alongside the Rhine into Mayence ? a lovely wide River and the city has good bridges. Took train for Weisbaden which we reached about 6 p.m. and put up at the French Club at the Palace Hotel ? a most imposing and luxurious place. The porter (like so many other folk on the Continent) spoke perfect English. This luxurious hotel has lovely rooms and mine is a gem for 7 marks (3/6) a day. The exchange is still all against the Hun and for 20 fr I got value for 40 marks. We had dinner for 3 fr and then went to the Opera ?Samson Delilah" arriving during the first act. All in German and during the interval it was a German crowd that thronged the foyer. Many bald squareheads the girls lack the chicness of the French.
