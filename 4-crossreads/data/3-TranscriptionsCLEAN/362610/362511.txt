  
 Sunday 22 October 1916 Very heavy frost & cold morning & day, but with no rain. Breakfast at the usual time & was rather sleepy after the previous 2 night's broken rest. Had to get the gear away by 8.30 : it was to go on a 2 day's journey while we rested 1 day & went the double distance by motor bus the following day. Had to remain in during the morning in the absence of the brigade major & others, & was glad of a fire in the mess room during the day. It did not seem much like a Sunday.
