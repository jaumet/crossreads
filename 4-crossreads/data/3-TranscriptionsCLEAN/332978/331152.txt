  
 73 October 12th Eva & Neame. We had Soup, Salmon Meat Pudding (Turkey & Fowl) Rice Pudding Cavaire & [indecipherable]. Both puddings proved to be a huge success We also had wine after which we adjourned for usual game cards - Both Neame & Eva enjoyed themselves - 
 October 13th Raining again today & very miserable - no concert held tonight owing to artists being indisposed - our 10 rubbers of Bridge finished today - opponents winning by 50 points. It was a most interesting game. Had glass wine again with Dear Little Eva - 
 October 14th (Sunday) Got up early this morning to attend church service - The minister speaks English, & delivers a very good sermon, but he only has one prayer & a few Hymns. He only comes once a fortnight - Commr Lewis reads the morning service every alternate Sunday. 
 We challenged our opponents again at another 10 rubbers - Invited to tea  yesterday  with Neame 
 October 15th Walk today I did not go - I played Ralph Billiards, having a handicap of 52, & He 42. He beat me by 16. Should have had more handicap. 
 Bought Evas ticket  for 60 marks  for the Billiard tournament for 60 mark
