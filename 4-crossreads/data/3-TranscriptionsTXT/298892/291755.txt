 I received a book entitled "The Gully of the Bloomansdyke" by A. Conan Doyle with your last letter. It is an interesting collection of short stories. I also managed to get hold of a much similar book by the same author "Round the Fire Stories" I think was the name of it. Lately I have very fortunate in securing reading matter. I got in touch with our postal clerk who is a great reader himself and borrowed several good stories including "The Channings" a book which, if I recollect rightly, you have frequently recommended to me, "The Sheriff of Dyke Hole" Ridgewell Cullum, (a tale of the wild and woolly West) "A Gentleman of London" Morrice Gerard, and "Famous Modern Battles" A. Hilliard Atteridge, also "Sir Nigel" by A. Conan Doyle, (more like one of Sir Walter Scotts historical novels. (The latter I think you sent me). This represents my reading for the last couple of months and is more than I have done for some considerable time. I am afraid you must have missed several of my letters as we were informed of the loss of several Australian mails. Trusting that you are all safe and well and in the best of health. Your loving Son Eugene. 
 P.S. Don't be deceived by the date on this letter. It was started on the 22nd. alright, but is only concluded on the 27th., and posted on the 28th. August.
