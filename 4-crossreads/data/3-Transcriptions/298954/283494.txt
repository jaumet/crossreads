<p>1917<br/>Mon 9th July<br/>A sail was sighted at abt 3 pm.   Position 26 &frac12; S. 166 &frac34; E.   The boarding party left the ship at abt 4.30 pm in the launch &ndash; it was not necessary for the "Wolf" to fire a stopping shot.</p>
<p>At 4.35 pm heavy smoke was sighted on horizon.   "Wolf", suspecting a trap, rushed off at full speed, leaving the boarding party on the sailing ship to take their chances.    Steaming hard all night.</p>
<p>Tue 10th July.<br/>The seaplane, which was unshipped and stowed below during the run in the Tasman, was hastily re-assembled this morning and rose at 9.30 a. in perfect weather to locate the abandoned sailing ship.</p>
<p>Wed 11th<br/>"Wolf" did not rejoin her capture till this morning.   The raid laid off the vessel and transhipped food and other stores in the ship's boats.   A light swell running.   A woman and a little girl waved across from the poop of the ship.</p>
