<p>o.a.s<br/>26/8/17<br/>My Dear Judge,<br/>A very laggard mail last week brought me the newspaper cuttings about Caesar and the non-readmission of R.D. Meagher which you posted on May 29. It [indecipherable] that the Australian Mail Service at present is very disorganised; up to June 6th , (the date of the latest letter I have had from home) my letters from London of Mar 19 only &amp; no later had been received.<br/>I was very glad to hear of Caesar's promotion and that he had thus received some recognition of the work he has done. I believe that at the present moment his battalion is out in rest well behind the lines.<br/>The case of R.O.M. was interesting and the result did not altogether surprise me. What the C.J. said appeared very clear, unmistakable and to the point in the particular light in which he was obliged to view the matter.<br/>I had a letter from Keith some time ago in which he spoke of going out to Australia for six months convalescence at the least. No doubt you will all be very</p>
