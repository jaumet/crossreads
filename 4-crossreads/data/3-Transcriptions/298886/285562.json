<p>12th June MON 1916. Romani.</p>
<p>Plenty of things happened during our absence. 60 reinforcements arrived from our base details at Tel El Kabir. and about 150 horses Also a German Taube paid the Camp a visit but he did not drop any bombs he had expended all his supply on Kantara I don't know what damaged he caused. He turned his machine gun on our Camp but did no damage. He also visited the NZ. Camp causing some damage Killing one officer and wounding several others I only hope our own air-men play hell with those people.</p>
<p>"Stand to Arms" At the usual hour I for one had only had about 3 hours sleep since the night of the 9th June.</p>
