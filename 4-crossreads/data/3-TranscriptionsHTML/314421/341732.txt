<p>We are able to get the papers here as usual.<br/>I went for a walk with Dowden this afternoon. A good view can be obtained from the top of the ridges above the village.</p>
<p>Monday October 22. 1917. (1176.)</p>
<p>It is foggy this morning.<br/>There are a lot of colds about. I paraded sick &amp; got some medicine for my cough &amp; also got my feet dressed. I was given light duties for the day. I made some [indecipherable] cases today for Jim Lawler &amp; myself out of cartridges.</p>
<p>Tuesday October 23. 1917. (1176)</p>
<p>Showery this morning.<br/>I again paraded sick &amp; was given light duties.<br/>There was a wild rumour afloat last night that Holland had declared war on England. I don't believe it &amp; there is no strained relations between the two countries. The papers make no mention of it.</p>
<p>There was another air raid on England. 5 Zepelins have been brought down in France, three trapped. They were scattered, hunted, &amp; smashed by French airmen &amp; guns. The Zeppelins were lost in their return from England.</p>
<p>To day the war has been raging 42 lunar months &ndash; one prophecy of its duration, and yet there is no prospect of its immediate end, though I believe that it will eventually end as suddenly as it began.</p>
<p>Wednesday October 24. 1917. 1178<br/>I was on 4th. Picquet last night or rather this morning from 3 to 6. It was a fine night; the horses &amp; mules</p>
