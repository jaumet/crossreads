 On Easter Sunday a service was held in an old barn by Chaplain Dent.   This time of the year always brings back pleasant recollections of those good days I spent at Katoomba with my people, in  April, 1915 .   Why, it seems almost a lifetime. However, we must hope for the best, &amp; God grant that I will spend the next Easter season in Australia. The unit was in this unexciting, monotonous &amp; filthy village until the 4th inst, &amp; on this day at 5.30 p.m. orders came to hand that every one was to be ready to move off at 6 p.m,   All were glad that we were leaving the place at last &amp; it was rather a rush only having half an hour to have tea &amp; pack our kits. Punctually at 6 p.m. we start on the march back to that village, which we arrived at on the 28th instant. It was most "enjoyable" march, the rain came down in torrents all the way.  Here we boarded motor lorries, &amp; enjoyed a delightful little trip of about 30 miles.   Twenty four men to a lorry, so you can guess that we were rather a little cramped.   At 4 o'clock the following morning we leave the lorries &amp; march to a village about two kilos. away, &amp; all turn in.  Not in bed 5 minutes when an unexpected order came to hand to move on again. The air was blue with Australian language at this latest order, but, of course, "orders is orders you know", &amp; off we started on the road again. It was a most miserable march, &amp; I can safely say without contradiction, that it equals that march in Northern France in July 1916 from Morbecque to Estaires. It rained continually all the while, &amp; the  mud  - "enough said."
