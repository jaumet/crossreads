  
 However he has a vastly better time I suppose but after all I don't care, I'm glad I joined our Army & went through the mill.  I went over to his Mess to lunch.  The others were inclined to be patronising but I shook them up, most refined & highly educated & intelligent.  The O.C. reckoned he couldn't understand why I was only a Sergeant.

 By the way Hefty Lasham writes to cheer.  She has also sent me a cake.  I haven't received it yet but isn't it good of her.

 Goodnight, I hope you're OK.  My love to Mac & Graham & the Boss & yourself very muchly. 
 Always yours Wilkie
