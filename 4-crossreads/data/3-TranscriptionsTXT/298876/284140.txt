 Cape Guardafui came to view about 5 pm, we were quite close to some Hundreds of Porpoises &amp; Dolphins. Semi finals of a Boxing Tournament took place &ndash; two AMC Boys gave a good account of themselves, one got a draw &amp; the other skied the towel after a good exhibition in the third round. Land is lost to sight again about 9 pm. 
 Tuesday 29.2.16 
 Fairly warm. Very Calm. Saw some half dozen boats, one Cruiser in the distance. Lights of Aden came to view about midnight &ndash; also several other light Houses &ndash; A very pretty sunset &ndash; very red.
