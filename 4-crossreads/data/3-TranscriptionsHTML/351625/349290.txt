<p>doubtless the one you posted it was very nice too but I am sorry they are still sending mufflers etc. which at this time of the year are useless to us, socks of course come in at any time but it is a shame with the other stuff as we really cant carry them &amp; cant give them away.  Oh well I will have to say Au Revoir as I am due to go out &amp; get a feed.  Give my love &amp; kisses to all &amp; whips for yourself.</p>
