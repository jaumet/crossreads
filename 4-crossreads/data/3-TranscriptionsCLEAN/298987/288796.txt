  
 Sunday 4th Church Parade had to march about 1 Killo along a very muddie lane A very good address. The Hun came over last night & we had quite a good search light display as there were low clouds Saw no Planes & heard no eggs burst. 
 Monday 5th A lot of messing about this morning as we were inspected by Maj Gen Glascow he is in charge of the Division. It was had enough but nothing to the afternoon. My Platoon or rather part of it is on Picquet duty & had just drawn our tea when we were ordered to fall Of course we did not fall in imediately but growled & argued & bolted as much tucker as possible Then as usual stood about were inspected 4 times Now have 11/2 hours to wait before going out. The Picquet amounted to going about I mile & sitting down until 4 PM then back. Forgot to mention had 2 parcels a few days ago One from Ann One [indecipherable]
