<p>Saturday July 21st<br/>We have to put everything out of the hut every Saturday &amp; scrub out. No drill is never done on a Saturday, it is considered the cleaning day.<br/>We have a great arguing mob in the hut now, I believe they would argue on nothing. A typical argument is on the different works of Field Ambulances in the field. Nearly every one of them have been over to France. Went to the pictures in Tidworth, not too bad.</p>
<p>Sunday July 22nd<br/>Rather a hot day. Felt very lazy all day, so I made my bed soon after dinner, intending to have a sleep, but the mob kept up too much noise. We have the hut full now, 28 men in all. Done some writing after tea. I received a letter from Ausy today dated April 17th. Three mails from Australia has been sunk through enemy action, &amp; one going to Ausy, official.</p>
<p>Monday July 23rd<br/>Wrote a couple of letters, &amp; done some washing this evening. I hate washing but owing to shortage of cash, I have to do it. Eggs, etc, for supper of a night time have been turned off, also owing to above. The lads in camp are keeping very quiet. A couple of changes have been made in the Military Police staff.</p>
