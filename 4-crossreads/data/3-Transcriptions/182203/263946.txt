<p>S.S. Kyarra<br />14.4.15<br />My dear Mother &amp; sisters,<br />I did not receive your letter, got the telegram, so suppose it will be forwarded on to Brisbane. Had a very enjoyable time in Sydney. When we arrived, a number of people were waiting to see some of us. Nurse Martin had two brothers also some friends, amongst whom were Mrs Hamilton &amp; her daughter Mrs Johnstone (n&egrave;e Veany Hamilton). They were surprised at seeing me so invited Martin &amp; me to morning-tea on Monday. They live at Manley in such a charming position. I think I wrote &amp; told you we went to Manley. A number of the other sisters came to Manley with us but spent their time on the beach.<br />Also on the station was a Miss Graham a nurse training at Melb. Children&#39;s Hospital. A great friend of Dorothy Newton, she is home on holiday.<br />We had afternoon tea with the Grahams &amp; they are awfully jolly people. We stayed their until 5.30.p.m. Then Dorothy &amp; I caught the 5.45 pm boat for Watson&#39;s Bay. Had tea there &amp; caught the tram back to Sydney. We both enjoyed the outing immensely &amp; Dorothy just loves the harbour but hates the city. Monday we had a busy day. I have told you how we spent the morning. Returned to Grahams for lunch</p>
