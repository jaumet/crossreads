As many men as possible "jumped in" to do this work, as it would practically mean putting a good floor in each of the 8 tents for each Company but although B C &amp; D Coy's were allowed to so use the duck boards, A Coy had to place them outside the tents to form a walk from the Orderly Room tent to the end of the line in order (as the men put it) so that the officers could walk along the line of tents without getting their beautiful boots covered with mud.

The morning after his arrival, on Sick parade 131 reported unfit for duty including the Sentry concerning the latter the Sergt explained how he had been for months working on &amp; in front line AMC
