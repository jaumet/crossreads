  
 Easter Monday 9-4 We are all desperately hungry after living on Tommy rations for a week.  The Drain pipe artillery are practicing every evening close alongside.  The last lot of Tommies got us for a tin of Biscuits 1/2 a box of Bully & 25 Francs.  There was a big stunt last night 56 Tanks participating.  It was a great success.  Two army corps took part in it.  There has been a very heavy bombardment every night since we have been here. [First Battle of Bullecourt] Tuesday 10-4 Heavy snowstorm today.  Slush everywhere.  Gen. Birdwood takes huts over [?] tomorrow.  Great news of successful air fighting yesterday. 
 Thursday 12-4 I am not sure that today is Thursday but will have to chance it.  Fritz sent only 2 shells over yesterday.
