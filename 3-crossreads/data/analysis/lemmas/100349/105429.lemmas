 I have not been detect so far . They have no case anyway , the evid is all drunk . 21/5/17 . Left No9.C.C.S. and march via Albert , to Buir , where I rejoin 16 Platoon . There are onli 3 of the fellow left who march through this town with me 6 week ago . We lost about 40 men out of the Platoon . All the rest of the fellow here are Reinforc I do not know ani of them . A militari rule say that , a unit is disorganis when it has lost 60 per cent of it effect but the 3rd Battalion was still a forc to be reckon with when it had lost near 90 per cent . One British divis was smash in 12 hour of that fight . two other were use up in hold the flank so that the Australian divis would not be cut off . There are no fli on the Incompar , Fight , 3rd .
