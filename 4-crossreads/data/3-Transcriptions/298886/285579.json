<p>painted on her wings and body. Almost immediately after her could be seen another 'plane approaching at express speed This plane had the familiar round red Ring on her.</p>
<p>The Taube twisted and dived and ducked but the pursuer was perceptibly gaining when they got nearly over head  Our 'plane  opened fire with a machine gun. At the first volley the Taube was seen to drop lower and swerve at a dangerous angle very probably the pilot was hit but she righted herself again and with wonderful agility steered clear And then took an upward turn It was magnificent to watch these two engines of destruction keenly bent of destroying each other.</p>
<p>Then a most unfortunate Contretemps happened. All our machine guns on the ground opened fire on the Taube with the result that our air-man fearing a bullet intended for the other fellow &ndash; held back. Consequently losing ground thereby letting the Taube slip through his fingers so to speak The machine guns were instantly silenced but unfortunately the Taube had by this time gone a good distance ahead.</p>
