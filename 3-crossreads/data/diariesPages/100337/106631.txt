On Tuesday 4th December we had about 12 inches of snow, It looks beautiful on the ground, but it makes the air very cold.

On the 7th I was sick with a sore throat & Influenza, I went to the Doctor, he gave me some medicine and work.

The snow that fell on Tuesday has just dissapeared. The food is as usual, (bad.)

On Sunday December the 16th we had more snow which continued to lie on the ground till 31st of the month. On two or three days last week we had a very heavy frost, and the early morning of all day, we had thick fog. The food was bad as usual.
