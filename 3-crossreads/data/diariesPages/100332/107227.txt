At 9.30 the Boat which is named Invictor, a Screw Boat of about 1000 Tons very fast, there were about 1200 Boys on Board including about 20 W.A.A.C Girls. After a smooth Passage although a bit Damp by Rain we pulled alongside of the Pier at 11 am as we disembarked ashore, all the Australians were called one side, there were only 38 all told we were marched up along the Platform waited until the Train came in. At 11.30 am all hands were aboard off we started for Victoria Station, London after a good run of two hours arrived in London, detrained was marched off to The Australian Head quarters in Horseferry Road where we were given all information, change of clothing, a Hot Bath last but not least a cheque for our Holidays. After I was fixed up I left to catch the Train to Bognor at the Station which left at 4.53 it was a tedious journey having to change Trains at Sutton, Horsham, Ford Barnham, I arrived at Bognor at 8 Pm, tired out after my long journey from France.
