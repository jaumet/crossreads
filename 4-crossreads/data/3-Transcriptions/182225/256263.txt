<p>A cold windy day again&nbsp; I found a warm spot in sun and read all day. Got some tarts &amp; cocoa in the forward galley in the afternoon &amp; had a good afternoon tea. It has been arranged for certain that we land at Durban and have a short route march &amp; then we are dismissed. There are &quot;Mother Carys&quot; chickens following us all the time also the big albatrosses we saw in the bight.</p>
