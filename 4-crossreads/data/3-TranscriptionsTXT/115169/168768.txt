We went on deck to discover who may have caused all this alarm and found it to be the Auxillary Cruiser Empress of Asia now very near to us, and she reported as being on her way to Cocos Islands to salvage part of "Emden's" movable gear if possible and at 5 PM we passed another of her class of ships this time the "Empress of Russia" en route to escort convoy to Colombo At 8 PM we met and passed H.M.S. "Hampshire"
