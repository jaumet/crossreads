I said to him hold on a minute but he did not understand what I meant so I let him go, on arrival on the parade ground the RS.M came round for my numbers of course I couldn't give him any but referred him to the officer in question so over he went but he knew nothing about seemed very surprised when I told him that he had no more right to march those men off than a private did if this sort of thing was going to go on they could get some one else to do the job, I was going to have the parade until they were handed over or not at all, however he backed down said it was a mistake it wouldn't occur again that's the way to hop on to these jokers they wonder where it comes from at times it does the world of good
