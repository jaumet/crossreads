<p>25 THURSDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny, but cold. I was</p>
<p>on stableman all day. The</p>
<p>right section got some</p>
<p>ammunition ready to take up.</p>
<p>It was the first we were</p>
<p>able to draw for three days.</p>
<p>There was a very &quot;big bombard&quot;</p>
<p>last night but have not</p>
<p>heard any result yet.</p>
