<p>Another quite morning. A few shells scattered about our area. Canteen to-day for 8th Battery. Called in at Olly's coming back &amp; had a chat. It was nice &amp; crisp and I enjoyed it. Had to dodge a little shelling.</p>
<p>Friday 12th Nov<br/>Called up at 9th Bty and in the afternoon went to Canteen for them and secured cakes &amp; on the way back a shell lodged in a dressing shed of the Ambulance at Brown's Dip  [about 100 yds from Lone Pine] and killed 3 poor unfortunates who were there while about 4 others were wounded. I saw the poor fellows getting taken away on stretchers and one seemed in a very bad way.</p>
