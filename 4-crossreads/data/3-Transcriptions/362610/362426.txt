<p>Saturday 29 July 1916<br/>Up fairly early to pack things &amp;c. A real summer's day, bright, hot &amp; dusty. Our march to Bonneville led us thro' one particularly lovely avenue of poplars where the shade was lovely, &amp; past the main aeroplane depot behind the present push. About midday we reached our destination, the men having fair billets, but the officers had to camp outside in a well-grassed paddock. My canvas sleeping-bag was much appreciated at night. During the afternoon had to fix up the pay for the company &amp; H.Q. &amp; was kept going for a while.</p>
