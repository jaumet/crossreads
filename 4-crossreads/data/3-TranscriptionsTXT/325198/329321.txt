 24 June 24, 1916 Etmaler  last night When I got back off gaurd the horses were all taken out of the stables &amp; linked up at the back, the lines &amp; tents all cleaned up &amp; every one had their saddles packed so I got to work &amp; packed mine, had a bath, bought a water bag off a [Eepto?] for 6 pt &amp; lay down on the saddle blanket out of the road of the horses &amp; went off to sleep.  We were turned out at 1.0 am &amp; moved off at two.  It was a beautiful night &amp; it was nice riding along with the cool breeze blowing in one's face.  One always thinks of the Sphinx, Pyramids &amp; veiled women being connected with these nights of Egypt   Still silent, mysterious, beautiful &amp; [indecipherable]. 
 Then dawn came gradually  &amp; old sol rose up in front of us &amp; very soon we had our coats off, he is a warm chap  We arrived at about 8 oclock gave the horses a drink at the well &amp; although the horses were famishing for a drink they turned up their noses at the brackish taste of it.  We got our lines down among a few palm trees, some horses being lucky enough to score a shady spot.  We are fixed up now again for a while tents &amp; all.  Stand to at 3.30 in the morning just the time I can do my best high pressure snoring stunt.  Ill likely use some language when they wake me up in the morning.  Our present camp is situated about &frac12; mile west of Romani.
