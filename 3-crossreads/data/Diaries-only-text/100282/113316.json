are fully 12 ft deep, wherever you look there are duckboard tracks, roads, light railway lines so on, whats more they are pushing the heavy line on, it is now well the other side of Ypres, as it creeps forward it carries monstrous guns on its rails, old Fritz was shelling Westhoek Ridge solidy as we came up, but for a wonder "Hell fire corner" was quiet.
We are relieving the 10th Batt. by some mistake we got here 3  hours to early so we have to wait until they clear up out. About an hour ago I saw a pretty duel in the sky, but our chap got the worst of it the Hun out manouvered our chap, he hit the plane with his gun alright for I distinctly saw pieces fly out of his wings down came the plane but quite under control he landed somewhere behind Westhoek
To day is the first anniversary of our disastrous stunt at Flers, when C D Coys were almost annilhiliated, I never saw the like of that night neither before nor since as for mud rain well don't mention it.
