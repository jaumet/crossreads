8.
Monday I am going to Wales for a while.
We are wondering here where our troops have been taken to. I think they are on the Canal - I do hope we get a chance at the Turks there.
I have seen Leslie Whitfield of course - he is now busy learning the art of flying I believe. Young Anderson-Stuart is staying here with me at present.
Please remember me to Keith & George Edward.
Sincerely Yours
F. L. Flannery
