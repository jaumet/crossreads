(a great haven for deadbeats, hoboes and bludgers).   After having some "eats" we made over to the Kings Stables.  A man in an office outside made out a ticket in my name admitting a party of five.   A groom took us in charge and showed us around the various stables.   There were about 80 horses in the stables at this time but, the groom explained the King used to keep 120 before the War.   Any horse that is at all sick is immediately put into a special stable till he is well.   He showed us the banners used with the Coronation Coach and that of the equerries coaches.   The man who showed us the Coronation Coach itself had learnt all his speech like a parrot and consequently was very uninteresting.   The coach is all hand carved and gilt.  It weighs 4 1/2 tons
