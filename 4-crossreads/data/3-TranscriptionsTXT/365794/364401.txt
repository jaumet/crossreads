 Monday 1 January 1917 [1918] The New Year!  Went H.C. [holy communion] 6.30 a.m. &amp; church room full of brave wounded men waiting patiently to be healed &amp; sent back to the front again.  Such a bright sharp morning &amp; pretty clouds.  Hymn 73 &amp; I wonder how many of us are to tread that awful road in this coming year! At lunch 3 sisters &amp; 9 V.A.D's from the "Arragon" [Aragon] sat with us &amp; their accts. are most depressing.  1200 men gone &amp; some sisters.  3.30 p.m. we went to the Residency, shook hands with L. &amp; L. Wingate rec'd gift &amp; walked in lovely grounds &amp; watched the old Nile flowing by as peacefully as ever.  Concert in Connaught 7 p.m.  A R.F.C. [Royal Flying Corps] man (N.Z.) flew over at 10 a.m. &amp; dropped greetings for 1918, then when over "Aotea" a wing broke &amp; he was killed &amp; the other man injured.  Altogether a full &amp; sad day in some ways.
