<p>have been a nicer one.</p>
<p>14th Mrs Newmarch gave us an afternoon tea at the recreation room to-day.  Twas very nice.  The Welsh band was there, so what could one wish more &ndash; I loved their rendering of the Rosary.</p>
<p>15th  Miss McConachy called to take me for a motor drive to visit the Flying Corps &amp; the Remount Unit, after the first visit we had 3 punctures so had to come back in a gharry.</p>
<p>16th  I have enjoyed many donkey rides but last night's was absolutely perfect.  9 of us went including Matron out on the lovely road to Matarich.  The moon was up &amp; the donks good &amp; we just jogged on or cantered as the mood took us.  Such a night for dreaming and reminiscing.</p>
<p>18th I went over to Service this a.m. &amp; Major Makeham preached from the text "God loveth a cheerful giver"  A beautiful sermon really.  The rifle brigade "A band of great old warriors who live in the barracks at the back of our place march in every Sunday morning &amp; 3 parts fill the church.  In the afternoon another Sister &amp; I had afternoon tea at Shepheards with two E- Officers &ndash; then took a tram to Heliopolis &ndash; walked around a bit admiring the fine buildings there &amp; finished up by calling at the Luna Park, having a ride on the Scenic railway &amp; down the water shoot etc.  Its converted into a pretty &amp; attractive Gaiety Show.</p>
