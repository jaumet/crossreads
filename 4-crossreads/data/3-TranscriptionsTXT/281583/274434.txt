Fritz let us alone. During the day a Bale of sheepskin clothing arrived &amp; it was hard work to keep the chaps off them. It is very hard to manage the men under these conditions &amp; when the spirit ration is brought to light things are much worse.
I received a few letters today which were like a straw to a drowning men &amp; God alone knows how eagerly I read them, as it is a good while since I received any. This is the anniversary of my departure from Sydney &amp; if you were to only see the ground &amp; know the hardships that we are living under you would know that it is  not all beer &amp; skittles.
All the time &amp; despite the terrible nature of weather &amp; ground conditions, our attacks are being pressed home. As no doubt your papers will tell you. Taking the year right throughout, &amp; through all circumstance I never suffered as I am now.
