<p>every day there are rumours that we are off in a week.  Everyone seems to have a friend in a high office who told them something in its utmost secrecy.  We have formed a little band of our own which is made up mostly of the Surfing men and I think we will get on very well together.  There are Tom, George, Steve and Rob also Hal and myself.<br/>Hal is still in good form but the exercise does not seem to take away any of the adipose tissue.<br/>I made another friend today, an Irishman called Gillan, I think we will be great pals, he is very witty and has a fund of stories.<br/>Now I must close as I'm mess orderly today and have to scrub the dixies and fed the lions.</p>
