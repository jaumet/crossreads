  
 General Smuts arrived at the same time in the Edinburgh Castle & Peace Celebrations & Public holiday was proclaimed & a great reception for the general.  The city was gaily dressed with flags & bunting.  Guns fired salutes & fire works display at night.  Here we met one of the German captured Atlantic liners, 3 funnels, the Carl Colomia now painted Union Castle colors & run under that company in harbor having come out from Southampton & whilst on the way out had a serious explosion in the engine room in which a great deal of her machinery was smashed.  She being a oil burning steamer the explosion occured in that direction & consequently came out under great difficulties.  At 4 p.m. we left Table Bay for Port Natal for coal & water.  The Red Cross at Cape Town having sent 40 cases of oranges off to our troops. 
 5.8.19 We have 809 to go to Port Natal & this will delayed & increase our distance to Australia, fine weather prevailed throughout.  At noon we covered 283 miles & expect to arrive at 7 a.m. on the 7th August.  A concert was held at the 2nd class saloon & came off very successful.  A brass & string band has been organised in the 1st Saloon & plays several selections every night at 7 p.m. whilst having dinner.  At 8 p.m. passed a Portegeese liner going the same way bound for Delegoa Bay.  At midnight we were off Algoa Bay, Port Elizabeth.  Lovely weather prevails but rather cold, Temp. 54 degrees.  We find strikes prevail of serious nature throughout South Africa through the high cost of living & profiteering.
