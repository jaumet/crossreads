Tuesday 31 July 1917.
With the camels again this morning. Went on leave to Cairo last night and going again tonight. A wonderful sight and places to be seen "as old as the hills".
Saw old castle where slaves were sold in early days. This place now used for military purposes. The staging of the gallows still remains & old blood stains are still to be seen.
