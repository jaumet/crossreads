<p>February 10, 1916 Thursday</p>
<p>Spent half the night enjoying our contents of the parcels from home, some of the cake was spoilt but everything else was OK, Alec sent a parcel to all of the old boys &amp; good oh too they all appreciated it very much, no parcel from the girl came to hand though guess its alright though.Exercising as usual Mel went down to Teiria today &amp; had a good trip. I renovated my scrap &amp; cleaned her up. Mail was sorted today &amp; I got two &ndash; one from Nora &amp; the other from Nell. Nora's was to the point asking me what I had done with Vere's diary, Victorian mail is expected in tonight so hope there's a further addition to my list of letters bed at 9.30, Mustard went to town &amp; bought three violins oh! for some music after this.</p>

<p>Revielle as usual.</p>
<p>Went for the usual ride in the morning &amp; had one gallop which came off successfully for Len, stayed in in the afternoon as Hal had a friend coming up to see him, I went up to meet the train but found that there had been a break down on the line &amp; he would probably arrive about 6 or 7 oclock. All sorts of rumors are afloat as to when the Bediouins are coming it is said that they are in touch constantly at Waddi Natrun &amp; that the whole force is returning from Mersa Matruh &amp; are credited with the skill of being able to give us a good go. Wrote letters home &amp; Nell then retired after accounting for more of our gift stuff.</p>
