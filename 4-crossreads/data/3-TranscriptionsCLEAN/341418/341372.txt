  
 for at about 6.30 thin morning a few hours only after our arrival an enemy aeroplane came over the camp, having evidently followed us up, and dropped seven bombs on the camp, doing a lot of damage in fact killing 4 men of the 3rd Light Horse  &  wounding nearly 20 more 6 of which have already died from wounds, 2 officers and killing or disabling about 30 to 40 horses. Thus it was extremely fortunate that    we   the aeroplane did not catch the column on the march. Of such a kind then is one of these "stunts". I feel an overwhelming sympathy with,  &  pity for Poor old Xenophon
