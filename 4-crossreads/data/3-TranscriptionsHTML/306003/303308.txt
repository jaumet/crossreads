<p>1.4.16<br/>Sat 1st<br/>Reid went away to the School of instruction at Zietouen this afternoon<br/>Forgot to take my watch out of my pocket yesterday when changing my clothes after the ducking in the Canal &amp; am afraid it is no good now as the water has gone through it;</p>
<p>The natives are on the phones again &amp; Abdul Moolah is back again to attend to any business for the Omdah of Hassan Pasha &amp; I am glad he is back again as he does all my washing (or his wife does) &amp; does it better than any I have seen  he also does any odd jobs &amp; expects no Baksheesh.  he is the only native I have met who does not ask for any<br/>yesterday I gave him 5 PT the only payment he has had from me yet;<br/>The troops do 2 hours musketry every morning</p>
