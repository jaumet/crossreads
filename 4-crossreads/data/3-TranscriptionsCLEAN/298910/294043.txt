  
 from this nerve racking din of war. 
 26/7/16  Wednesday 
 At Dressing Station "Nouveau Monde" quite a treat to know you are virtually out of harms way. Helping to dress all day - tho things are very quiet. It was as good as a tonic, after coming from the trenches to receive 2 letters, one from G. Hegerty & M. Single. 
 27/7/16  Thursday 
 Raw cold day - very hazy. Got letters from Grace, Mrs O'Kelly & Annie - Had the day to myself, but to be in readiness to proceed anywhere. Got in a few very nasty cases - Heavy bombarding all through the night & today - South of Laventie. One thing that was very noticeable right through the busy times was the  absence of N.C.O.'S to take any responsibilitys near the firing line, not one can boast of being within 3 miles - There is absolutely no chance whatever of promotion in this Unit.

 Very nice day - sunny. Heavy fighting and heavy bombarding on our left at Armentiers. Aeroplanes very busy. At 8 of our planes
