11/3/16   Go to the Citadel with Eric & Freddy. Eric won't come down Joseph's Well. Go to Ezbekia Gardens for tea & then to "The Kursaal" - vaudeville show. Eric shows his appreciation of the singing by comparing the singer with a man sharpening a saw. A dag of a show.
On the way back we went to Ezbekia again for supper, & whilst waiting for a tram at Ataba-el-Khardi we saw a native marriage. The procession is headed by a score or two of youngsters then a torchbearer with a cage full of flaming material, then more natives & then more torches & last but  by no means least a bagpipe band, two drums, & bassoon & about a dozen youngsters with candles in glass globes surrounding the bridegroom
