21/12/18 GourdinneFiner today. Did a round of the billets and found the rifles much below standard and the latrines in a bad way. Roused up a number of people. The village is a prosperous and substantial place and I should say that the people are in general very well off. Gorman returned in the early afternoon having been up to Bruxelles and been successful in securing the necessary blocks for our dinner menus. This day we sent an increased leave party into Charleroi. Madame's daughter from Charleroi came in at lunch time and is a fine looking woman but rather inclined to stoutness. Rode over to Nalinnes to Bde. HQ and had afternoon tea with General Robertson. Gullasch and others came in then. The Prince of Wales is now attached to our Corps and is moving around a lot .
