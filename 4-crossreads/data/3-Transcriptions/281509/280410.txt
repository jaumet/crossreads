<p>1916 July 6<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Reveille 6.30. a.m. parades &amp; drill the order of the day.<br/>Went for a walk up the road this evening to Neuve Eglise on my own. Came back &amp;; went down to Y.M.C.A. tent. A very tragic thing happened about &frac14; hour after. Our 12 pounder gun had fired 2 or 3 shells &amp; the enemy replied. One shell caught 3 of our 1st Field men who were walking down the road. Killed one. Stan Bull from Newcastle tore arm off another Warren, B G Nairsby unhurt. A Tommy was also killed from shock. One never how soon he will meet his fate in this area.</p>
