Wednesday 20 June 1917.
Reveille 4.am. "Port Sydney" beside us in the harbor. Breakfast 5 a.m. In full marching order water bottle filled, a few biscuits in haversack and with sea & universal kit bags we paraded on upper deck at 6.45 a.m. C.B.F.A. disembarked at 9 a.m. & marched straight into open trucks. Took off gear & kits and arranged ourselves in trucks. Placed in ourselves charge of truck & was in with 20 odd others.
Train moved off from wharf at 9.45 a.m. Arrived Mouscari camp (n), Ismalia at 12.45 p.m. & disembarked immediately. Carrying our sea kits & wearing full equipment we marched across the desert to the Isolation camp site 11/2 miles from main camp. Tea issued to some C.B.F.A. got none so had to use our biscuits and water. Threw off equipment & had to turn to and pitch tents - 280 tents pitched by "Boorara" troops. "Port Sydney" troops arrived at 4.30 pm. (after we had pitched their tents.)
