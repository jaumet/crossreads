down the different business streets and bought p/cards and stamps, map of Los Angeles, and 2 books on Australia for Mr Mathews. Met an Australian who had been discharged from 15th btn and had come back here to live. 
Came back to office and wrote p/cards, then went out again and posted them and also bought a Colgate shavings stick for 30 cents. Came home to tea per motor and stayed home for all the evening and showed my souvenirs to all the family.
