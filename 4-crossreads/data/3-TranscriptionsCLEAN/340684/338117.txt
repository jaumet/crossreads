 Dearest Joker and Bobbie I got the one pound alright thanks very much. I will be able to return it tomorrow as Charlie sent me back the money I lent him - I haven't been able to write this week as my eye wouldn't let me - Bassett and Kitson were sent to Epsom last Wednesday, they are coming over tomorrow, I feel lost without them here - Beautiful day today hope it will be the same tomorrow - I am looking forward to meeting Miss  Beattie - Sister Hamilton took me out to tea the other afternoon she sends all sorts of messages to you both - Can't write any more the tears are starting to come 
 Fondest love Ever your devoted brother Gib
