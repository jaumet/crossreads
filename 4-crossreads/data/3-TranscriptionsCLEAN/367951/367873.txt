From the trenches
xx Beat xxxx
Dear Beat & FamilyJust a line to let you know i am in good health i had a letter from Tom Dixon to day and he said Kate rote to him and told him i was alright and gave him my address till he heard from Kate he and a lot of the Greta fellows in England heard that i had fallen. So i am just scribbling these few lines with fear some of them may have writen home and you got to hear about it i might tell you Beat i am very much alive and if they only knew the good times we are going to have Beat when i come home they would think so. You can tell the children i have been all through Belgium and i am in the trenches their now. No news Beat so i must close hoping this note finds you all in as good a health as i am From your ever loving husband Tom.
Silver Richardson and Billy Twist sent their love to me in Toms letterThey are in England
