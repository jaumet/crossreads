<p>are still understrength.<br/>The mobile gun is quite close to us again this morning &amp; tearing into old Fritz.<br/>16th. At last the weather has taken up this morning is a beauty not a cloud in the sky, it is an almost perfect morning the sun is shining brightly, birds are singing gaily, while the whole countryside is nothing but a mass of green &amp; leafy trees sweet flowering hedges blossoming fruit trees, &amp; the paddocks are a riot of wild &amp; garden flowers &amp; the incense arising from all this mass of beautiful colouring is something lovely for you know it is Springtime here &amp; we have all heard &amp; read about this part of the world &amp; the beauty of it for 6 months or so, &amp; it quite deserves its reputation, but the other 6 months has a different side to it, "what oh".</p>
