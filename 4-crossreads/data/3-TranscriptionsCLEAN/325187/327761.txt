  
 [Sunday January 16 1916] 
 All hands working laying troughing, putting down horse lines (difficult in the sand) & trying to find Regimental baggage sent by rail.  This is a Godforsaken sandy place, but better than the Peninsular & Soldiers would not be happy if they did not growl We evidently will have our Base here for some time with trips into the Desert with Camels. Hardly any trace of yesterdays rain, Sand blowing in Clouds again. Good for sore eyes, all the Arabs are afflicted with a sort of blight, & the Flies made them look pleasant.
