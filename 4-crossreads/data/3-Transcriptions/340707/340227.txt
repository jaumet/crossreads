The building is enormous covering or enclosing 45 acres of ground &amp; the rooms of this splendid palace are so numerous that it takes 2 hours to walk them without stopping.</p>
<p>Most of the rooms are plain stonework once hidden probably by tapestries but some are lavishly decorated with painted ceilings eg Halle d'Antonius des Saisons etc. Gold must have been as cheap as dirt in the days when the decoration was completed. Many of the works have not yet been brought to light from their hiding places &amp; many of rooms are closed to permit of original arrangement.</p>
<p>In a room to herself surrounded by an iron railing stands the wonder of wonders the greatest treasure the Louvre possesses Venus de Milo see my notes re Roden for description The work says Roden is the most beautiful inspiration of the antiques. It is voluptuous regulated with a measure &ndash; it is the joy</p>
