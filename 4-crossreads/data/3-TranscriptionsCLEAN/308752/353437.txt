April 6th.  1917.   Good Friday.What pleasant memories this day brings back to me of that glorious time I spent with you at Katoomba two long years ago. At 10 a.m. the bearers left the old Dressing Station for the Rest Station, (where I was three weeks ago). The distance must have been about seven miles, rather a long march as we were carrying our packs & blankets etc., but it was done in good time, & we arrived at our destination just in time for dinner. The bearers received a great reception from the remainder of the Unit. In the evening I attended an impressive Church service in a town close by. An Australian band was in attendance. One of the items given by the latter was the Dead March in Saul. I don't think that I have ever heard it played so beautifully before.
