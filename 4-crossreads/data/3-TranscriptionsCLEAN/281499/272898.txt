The 1st Pioneer Battalion have been working on the trench we are in for the last couple of day's it is the remains of an old German trench & they are strengthening it in case of having to fall back on it.They put some big shells dangerously close to us this morning, one just seemed to miss my head & landed a few yards off me throwing earth & muck all over me, but still no damage done to life or limbEverything very active this morning guns, shells aeroplanes, balloons are everywhere to be seen & you can hardly hear yourself talking.Just close to where we are camped there are 6 big crosse's erected to the memory of 72 men & 4 officers who are buried just here, 12 men to a grave they belonged to the 21st K.R. Rifles (Yeoman Rifles), they got cut about properly & all were killed on the 15/9/16.This evening we were shelled very heavily
