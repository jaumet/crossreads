<p>30/4/1916  Sunday</p>
<p>Had a very fine roll up at 8/30 am Mass on the desert. General McKay &amp; General Godley together with the staff attended. Father King, who is attached the 15th Division gave a very eloquent sermon, which I much enjoyed, there was a general march past after Mass. Had two good swims &ndash; Saw two fine Russian Destroyers going the Canal.</p>
<p>May 1st  Monday</p>
<p>Quite a scare of aeroplanes all day &ndash; On Guard during the 24 hours. At night it was very cold. Rumoured all thro the Camp that General Townsend has had to surrender &ndash; altho we can't get anything Official &ndash; Artillery firing &amp; Bomb throwing etc going on all day. The 5th Division went out on a route march &amp; when they came in, I noticed Father King at the head of a platoon with his water bottle etc, had been doing his bit with the boys. I never see any other minister out.</p>
