The waitress combined the three of us together and handed the whole bill to him. Things were becoming more funny than ever. He ordered another ice and dividing the whole bill into three we each paid our share.

Working in ward with a chap from the North of England, very decent, happy-go-lucky sort of chap he is.

April 12th. Wed.
Things are carried on very systematically in this hospital, but I cannot bear the English nurses bossing around. Went to a lecture on "certain aspects of the war" in the Y.M. Hut.

April 13th. Thurs.
Wards inspected by some "K-nut" with plenty of "Red Tape" about him. The men of our unit re-count their experiences in some of the questionable places in Rouen. Some of them make a practice of remaining out at night and coming home drunk. "Of course, these are men?" I.D.T.

April 14th. Fri.
A most enjoyable cup of tea is provided in the Y.M. Hut. Instead of paying for things over the counter, they have a system of paying by means of tickets. One buys the ticket at a paybox and hand the ticket on purchase of goods. This is a great saving of time and helps to deal with a large number of men who are making small purchases and as a result require change very frequently. The ticket are valued for a penny, twopence, and threepence.

April 15th. Sat.
Like all R.A.M.C. unit food is not very abundant in the Mess Rooms.

April 17th. Sun.
In the Evening went for a walk through the large forest near by
