quick & lively, & whats more we were right among the heads, nothing but big wigs & senior officers, I got the shock of my life, we were in a splendid position for we were no more than 20 yards from where they were giving the medals out, I sat between a Canadian officer & some fat old lady with lorgnettes, I sat still for a while till the sun came out then I took my fortune in my hands & walked boldly out to within 10 ft of the Heads who were pinning the medals on, took my camera out of the case & took 4 snaps as cool as you please, I wonder what ever the people must have thought of me in fact I quite expected to get hauled off by the scruff of the neck but they seemed to be highly amused for I heard more than one sing out "Good boy Aussie", no flies on you, & etc
