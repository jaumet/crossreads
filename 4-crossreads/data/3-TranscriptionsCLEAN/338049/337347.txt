  
 Friday 17 May Conducted parade 7 a.m. Grooming etc. 
 Off to Abbeville in afternoon with Whytecross & Robinson by motor wagon. Stopped but got through on a yarn. 
 Knocked about the town but afterwards called on Miss Priestman. Had tea very tediously. Left about 7.45 after further knocking about the streets. Very hot.
