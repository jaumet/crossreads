All blazed away then with great noise but only very feeble response was elicited. Some very bright flares went up and a little extra sniping carried on at 8.50pm. Turned in at 10pm settled down to quiet night. Suddenly our 18 pounders started dropping shells at 1015 on enemies firing line and supports. Strolled along and asked nearest sentries if they could see anything but they said \"no\". Could not help laughing as the beggars had their heads down so low in safety they could see nothing.

The men behaved splendidly falling quietly in at their posts all muffled up like divers groping about in the dark nearly unable to see through the little glass windows. All the big guns were now properly awake and the shells rocked the ground with their concussion the air full of smoke and the din indescribable. Shrapnel from shells just out in front cleared the floor of the dugout. It was lovely. Slackened off at 11 and entirely ceased at 11.15. Our telephone wires cut early so got on through artillery. Felt very anxious for Jays Post but all were safe there though terifically shelled. A good stunt all enjoyed it the men are splendid &amp; got into their gas outfit well. The whole show lasted one hour ? it seemed no longer than 5 minutes. Turned in at 12.15am ? All quiet and serene. No casualties in this Coy. but total for Regiment to date is 1 killed 3 wounded. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a3358054\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 54]</p>\n<p><u>France Firing Line \"45\"</u></p>\n<p>27/4/16</p>\n<p>Awakened by Mackay late for stand to owing to a misunderstanding so did not inspect as usual.
