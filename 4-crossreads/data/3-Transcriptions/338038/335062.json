<p>6<br/>again by this. I have just received a letter from her &amp; also one from Ted which I will answer first opportunity.<br/>I am enclosing a pamphlet of the Al Hayat Hotels at Helouan. We motored over there one night during the week. It is a great health resort on account of the sulphur springs.<br/>I see the papers report we are doing it in style and messing at Mena Hotel etc. I only wish they meant it. Mena has been turned into a general hospital.<br/>I don't seem to be able to write any more tonight so will say goodbye with love to yourselves and Pat &amp; the Yanawa &amp; Albury folk.<br/>I am, Your affectate Son<br/>Terence<br/>Had a letter from Lorna Cay during the week.
