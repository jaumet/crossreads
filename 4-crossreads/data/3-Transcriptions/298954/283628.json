<p>1918<br/>Sun 14th Apl<br/>The "local" waddled into Bebra in the early hours of the morning (about 3 am) &amp; we saw the welcome sight of a couple of flat-footed frauleins waiting on the platform with coffee-pails &amp; bread baskets &ndash; from which they fed our guard!   And we half famished!</p>
<p>However, after much chatter &amp; bargaining the dear creatures finally brought us bread, coffee ersatz, &amp; tiny packets of "Hackfleisch", a typical Hun delicacy consisting of raw chopped meat pounded into a slimy mass.  It was quite dark (our carriage lamp had gone out) so we ate the "Hackfleisch" with a clear conscience.</p>
<p>We left Bebra at 7 am &ndash; hooked on to another "local" leaving for Cassel.   Our postern grew quite garrulous at this stage, pointing out the prison of Napoleon III in 1871 &amp; so forth.   Personally, I was quite ignorant of the fact that Nap. III was a gefangener in '71.   Passed a large prison-lager (apparently British) at "Ober-something near Cassel.</p>
