Friday. March 21We tipped all our Guests out of Bibby's Hotel today, so that we can get the paint cleaned up. The S.M.O. says we can continue to have our have our meals & sleep there. The Head Sister doesn't like the idea of it. Poor woman, I'm afraid her liver is not too good. It is pretty rough, & our old Boat is rocking some. I finished off my letter to B.E. but it's not much use posting it in Hobart.
Arrived Hobart Sat. Mar 22This morning we went out on Deck & found ourselves anchored in a very pretty little Bay. The surrounding country was very pretty. We appear to be miles away from anywhere.When I was in France we used to joke about coming Home, & say that by the time we reached Home the people would be so sick of the sight of returned soldiers that they would take us round all the Back Streets, & now, owing to the confounded [indecipherable] that's just what they are doing. One Tasmanian went ashore in a Launch, we took some supplies aboard & sailed away for Melbourne about 3 p.m.We are due in Melbourne on Monday morning.Owing to a few words we had with the Head Sister Bibby's Hotel closed today.
