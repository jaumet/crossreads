  
 His no use as a stand by in any altercation with the wasters here - he sides with the last man who speaks in any argument.  I feel very sorry for him but he is getting very stupid.   I will help him as much as I can during the voyage & at the end will counsel him to remain in Australia & not come back here again.  I met Mr Knox the Red X commissioner - he arrived yesterday - I told him quite a lot of strange things. I got your letter all right also the one in parcel of clothes - glad Fred was able to look after you. I am quite anxious to know the results of your bustling about on my job - but have no doubt good will come of it.     It was a shame to worry you when you were so busy making your final arrangements. Hope you have nice cabins if not try & change them - best love to all the children & hoping to see you all soon & that you will be well & comfortable on the voyage. Your own old man Will.
