Every man was dished up with 220 rounds of am'n, second water bottle, rations for 4 days - it was rumoured we were advancing to Peronne. Two mills bombs two smoke bombs, 5 sand bags and a few sundry other things.  This is the time when you throw everything away soap towel anything possible to lighten your burdens.Blankets- each man had one- taken away - puttees taken off handed in and sandbags wrapped round our legs.The padres go round and say a few words and prayers over you - and your O/C reads instructions what you are to do, when you start, a certain time after zero - nobody ever knows what zero time is - the objective you take - the time you have to take it in and by. Repeats some bunkum
