<p>Sunday 1st April<br/>Went by car to "Albert" for drugs etc. altogether a very interesting trip. The road was in very good order considering that it contained several mine craters &amp; the trenches crossed it only a week or so ago. Traffic heavy so the going was slow most of the way. Saw "Le Sars" for the first time a very interesting sight as 'tis now merely a heap of matchwood. All bricks etc. have been used up leaving the broken beams etc. "Pozieres" has disappeared altogether. Saw no less than nine tanks on the way down all knocked rotten which makes the number about 20 that I know off. Seeing so many smashed up makes one curious to know if they were really successful. Also saw the remains of 4 of our planes which had been brought down. Albert was looking better several people having returned to it now that it is out of range. Passed a lot of cavalry</p>
