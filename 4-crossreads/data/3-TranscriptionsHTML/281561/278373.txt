<p>1st March 1917.<br/>The snow is all gone from the ground and has uncovered the bodies of hundreds of the brave fellows of our Second Division who fought over this<br/>Ground in November last year. The bodies of, New Zealanders, Scots, and Tommies also lie around to show where the waves of previous attacks had hurled themselves at this position in vain. A glance at this position tells a tale of bravery, more glowing than any words. It shows how the Prussian Guard leapt out of their trenches, to where our fellows stood unable to advance and fought there with the bayonet; breast to breast; for I saw the body of a Victorian who held the throat of a German in such a grip that even how he could not be separated from his victim. We are burying them now just where they fell. The more I see of our fellows</p>
