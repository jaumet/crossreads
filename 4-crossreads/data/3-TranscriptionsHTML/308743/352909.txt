<p>19 January 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>Stables per usual<br/>Cooking a bit of a trouble as wood is very green after break back to Reg Sigs.  The coms in British Army are still open &amp; Toby is making all inquiries &amp; we learn that they are good oh.  The boss has had his teeth fixed up at last the mail for Aust left today. The case against [indecipherable] turned out the right way for he only got 2 days. [indecipherable] must evidently have the folly of his ways and then to try &amp; make amends for his arrears after tea I've been compiling a code &amp; I also wrote to him giving him a graphic account of the different towns we have visited.  The Sigs all have had riding practice with jumps this afternoon no accidents. Lamp works at night I wrote to Eric. Bed  9-15.</p>
<p>20 January 1915<br/>Wednesday 23 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Stables as usual.<br/>After break I had my squad as usual the men have again been allotted bringing the HQ Sigs up to strength.  No word of the motor's yet but expect to hear tonight at the latest.  I wrote home &amp; to Nell and I think I really forgot myself for I really waxed sentimental &amp; I also gave Eric a fait dinkum report of both Alexandria and Cairo. Planted road [indecipherable] &amp; plotting for the N Bnd of left one first because was yards out but the next was right on it, the protractor was [indecipherable] had it explained properly until now.  No answer to my cable yet, for it is now 21 days since I sent same. Toby [indecipherable] a rigger down to 25 mls per hour smashed his bike up to smithereens.   Toby unhurt but bike slightly bent. [indecipherable] medical inspection to be on Monday next.  Bed at 9.30</p>
