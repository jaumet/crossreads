<p>At this I have to pull myself together and a disappointment namely the Cold Fact in capital letters that I do <u>not</u> get away tomorrow.  Some of my best Pals go on the Boat ("Juliana") but I am high &amp; dry B B &amp; B Far From Home &amp; restless and must face another week without grousing &amp; take my chance &ndash; I am booked for a ship seven days from now and she does the all sea route &amp; saves myself, my (escarrie) esquarie, offsider, my work a certain amount of knocking about, and further there is the evidence <strike>in me</strike> that I retain <strike>of</strike> the Desire to play the game as there was at Moascar, and one must not give in, so 'stay with him lad'.<br/>[Drawing]<br/>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
