<p>advantage. Numerous enemy balloons up and artillery fairly searching. Quiet night. Usual routine of corduroying. Got two lovely parcels and a big mail in to-day and spent the evening reading it.<br/>10.11.16 Usual routine. Another perfect day and artillery only moderately active. Aeroplanes very active all day constantly and I saw one beauty brought down all in flames. Fritz came over again last night but was very modest. Spent the evening reading papers &amp; eating chocolate.<br/>11.11.16 Usual routine. Only about 9 sappers on the job as the carpenters were called out to put up huts. However, we had a working party. Dull day &ndash; no rain. Letters from B.J &amp; N.A.R Crack guard regiments came up yesterday. Spent the evening reading a bit but went to sleep early at 7. Artillery very quiet until 12 when a bombardment started. A few shells came over feeling for the road during the night and a couple pretty close to our camp.<br/>12.11.16 Usual routine without a working party and very slow work. Knocked off at 2 and rode part of the way home on the pontoons. The division is moving out to-day but we are staying here and are to go on railway work I believe. Fritz's artillery pretty active to-day and he shelled the road fairly constantly. After tea very heavy bombardment towards Bapaume but it is easing now. 8.30 issue of sheepskin jackets to-night.<br/>13.11.16 usual routine this morning until 11.30 when we knocked off and came home. The tanks were just moving and we watched them interestedly. They are going back to R.E. yard as they are of no more use at present in the mud. Young 2nd lieutenant with M.C. in charge. Got home and after a clean up wrote letters of which there are 20 to do. On the way home saw martin Freitsch and spoke with one of the Cokers. Very heavy bombardment last <strike>at</strike> night at 12 and continued until about 6 this morning when it eased and it was calm all day. Fritz shells our environs pretty regularly but doesn't do a great amount of damage. our new job is railway construction just down in the hollow from where we are. <strike>In the afternoon</strike><br/>14.11.16 No work to-day so it was decreed a washing day and I cleaned my clothes and wrote letters all the morning. In the afternoon we decided to improve our dugout so started work making it wider and longer. Worked hard till tea time with the aid of MacKenzie and Linton and then had to give up. Still the roof to put on and a few more sandbags to be laid so we made it a shelter for the night partly open. Very cold east wind blowing and we couldn't sleep too well and piquet from 12 &ndash; 1 . Intense bombardment all round all night. Dull all day but no rain.<br/>15.11.16 heard to-day 2000 &amp; 4000 prisoners had been taken and numerous other rumours. They started work to-day but we stayed home during the morning and finished our dugout before dinner all except straightening the interior. Went to work after dinner and are on a tramway track alongside a railway line. Worked at packing the sleepers. Knocked off at 3.30. Intensely cold east wind all day and at stages could hardly hold  our tools. Bombardment fairly cool but increased again at night. After tea finished our dugout and now we only want a fire. Plenty of room and fairly warm and comfortable. bed early and feet very cold. However put on two pair of socks and conditions improved and slept pretty well after.<br/>16.11.16 For some unaccountable reason breakfast at about 6.30 and set out to usual routine at which I laboriously did many jobs</p>
