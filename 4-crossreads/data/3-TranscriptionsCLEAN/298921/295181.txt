  
 July, 1915 Thursday 29 All my Kit I leave at   Thomas COOK & Co Cairo, my medal at the Anglo Egypt Bank also about 20/-/- there 200/-/- is in England  If anything happens, Kit will be sent Australian -  it is a elaborate one, too much-  Rifle can always be picked up if necessary - & one wants to be free to lose everything without worrying - one soon gets used to the ground I prefer always you remember a hard bed so have one ready for me  when I come home
