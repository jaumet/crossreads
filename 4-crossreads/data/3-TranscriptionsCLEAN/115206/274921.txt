At Sea. H.S."Karoola."Weather fine and warm. Saw a most beautiful moonlight scene and a magnificent sunset today.The old "hooker" is busy grinding out her 15 miles per hour and had travelled another 345 miles since last night.The sea today is helping her along a great deal, and she has the benefit of a nice 4 knot breeze.Play Auction Bridge discussed Egypt and wrote letters. Stores still holding good.
