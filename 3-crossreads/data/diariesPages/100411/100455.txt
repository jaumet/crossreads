Reached La Fluer about 2 miles from camp on morning after leaving Rouen. Put in about 2 weeks at Base which is about 5 mile from centre of Havre. Not a bad joint. Saw most of the place. Met Miss Hindmarsh at a Base Y.M.C.A. Very nice lady a few very nice yarns. Trained on Bull ring. Left Havre on 18th reached billets with Batt. on 21st. Spent a night at St. Omer another fairly big place. Batt. just came back for a rest for a month or so they say. Route marches occasionally but better than base or Larkhill. St. Omer Had a good walk round St. Omer that evening.
