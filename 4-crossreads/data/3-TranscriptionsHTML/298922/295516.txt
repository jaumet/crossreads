<p>Wednesday 25 July 1917</p>
<p>Am looking out for Parcel of Sweets etc. &amp; will acknowledge. All ranks are like school boys &amp; enjoy primitive pleasures, eating being one. Throat lozenges are what I particularly like &amp; for use in the Squadron. HAIR CLIPPERS are appreciated. <strike>Usual Taubes over &amp; usual Anti Aircraft fire, usual result "nill". New Zealanders suffered very badly from bombs a few days ago.</strike>  Stand to hours 0300 daily now, a fog then by noon the thermometer reaches 112&deg; or more in the shade.</p>
<p>Posted notes yesterday as mails are most erratic these days. Got a rotten septic leg.</p>
