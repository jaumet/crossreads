<p>MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; very hot. I went into</p>
<p>Quirindi with Al &amp; saw Doc Grey</p>
<p>about my leg. He says there is an</p>
<p>oil sac bruised &amp; I must rest it</p>
<p>for a week or more. Got home for</p>
<p>lunch &amp; drove Hobsons pony</p>
<p>over to the Ridge &amp; got her shod</p>
<p>afterwards.</p>
<p>Tickle lopping in Top &amp; Boundary.</p>
