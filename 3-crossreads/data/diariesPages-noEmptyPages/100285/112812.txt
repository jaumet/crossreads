Bought a nice little toilet case this evening for 5/- I am going to send it down to Littlehampton, it will come in handy afterwards for a fellow wont be soldiering all his life not if I know it at any rate, I am always a buyer for these sort of things Since 4 oclock it has been raining cats dogs but the sun is shining nicely again now.
After tea tonight Lindsay I went down to the O. T. B. to see Len found him busily engaged playing bridge so we did not stop long, but went down to Sutton Veney had our usual snack for a wind up.
I have only been near my guard once during the day so you can see its some job.
