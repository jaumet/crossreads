<p>Mena<br/>Egypt 11th April '15<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>Father's letter of the 8th March with the sorrowful news of Maries death reached me this week. It is sad reading &amp; I am awfully sorry for D'Arcy &amp; the kiddies. Am writing D'Arce by this mail. Am also worried to hear Father has been suffering with the old enemy Rheumatism. I trust it is only a temporary attack and that next letter will bring better news.<br/>Several changes have taken place since I last wrote. A lot of the troops have embarked, their destination has not been published but we are practically certain it is the Dardanelles &amp; that hard scrapping is to be expected from the moment of landing. We expect to move into it any day now. The sooner the better, heat &amp; glare are<br/>I</p>
