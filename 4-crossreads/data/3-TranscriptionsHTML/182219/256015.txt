<p>We left Dieran this morning in a box brd car for Erdisd. The roads have dried up considerably but the wadies are still boggy &amp; we struck several times. Just outside the V of Mughar we had Magneto trouble which prevented us going further untill a reserve car cam[e] to our assistance. In the meantime we visited the native V of M- &amp; secured a series of pictures. The village is built on a steep hill which raises from the plain &amp; is by far the most pictorial I have visited. The houses &amp; huts are built entirely of mud &amp; stone, very little of the latter, flat roofed &amp; squalid. In the small courtyards are kept considerable number of fowls. A string of camels</p>
