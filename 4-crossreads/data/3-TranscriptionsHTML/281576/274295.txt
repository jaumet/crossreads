<p>Mon. Oct. 22.  Another glorious day.  Smithy &amp; I went out on the verandah.  Hooray, 4 Zepps brought down in France.  That's jolly good news.  They did a lot of damage in London though beforehand.  Mary Blakeman came to see me during the afternoon &amp; stayed about 2 hours.  Wrote Letter  40 to M.S.  We are having a Bun Fight tomorrow &amp; everyone is quite excited.</p>
<p>Tues. 23.  Nurses &amp; sisters &amp; maids are all flying around preparing for tonight's Feed.  Boxes &amp; Parcels of Good things are arriving in Big Quantities.  At 3.30 Nurse Jarrett came round &amp; started to get us ready.  Packed us up in wheeled chairs &amp; wrapped us well up in rugs.  Then we were placed in position at the Tables.  It was a great spread &amp; we did full justice to the good things provided.  A Lady paid for it all, &amp; after one of our Sergts had made a little speech, thanking her, we were allowed to attack.</p>
<p>There were Tomatoes, Brown Bread &amp; Butter (2/11 a lb) Cakes of all kinds, Lollies &amp; Chocolates &amp; a Pkt of Cigarettes &amp; Box Matches per man, &amp;  plenty of Sugar in the Tea &amp; Meat Pies.  Gee! what a Great Feed it was.  The Food Controller would have had a Fit had he seen the Spread.  After Tea we had a jolly good Concert.  I sang the evergreen "Spanish Onion" which always seems to take.  Sister Wicker gave us a number of songs in her usual charming style &amp; Nurse Jarrett gave us quite a lot of twiddley stuff on her violin accomp'd by Nurse Wilson on the Piano.  A Miss Grimshaw caused a lot of amusement by rendering a number of quaint songs</p>
