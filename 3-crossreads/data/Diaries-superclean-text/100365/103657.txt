in from the last offensive of the 1st July they all seem to be very pleased to be out of it. They are all practically stupefied from the Gigantic Artillery bombardment well they might be as it was bad enough in rear of the Trenches, God know what it must have been like in the fire areas.The Guns are just beginning to open again in our vicinity several shell bursts have been too close to as to be comfortable.The 1st Company move out tomorrow at 7 a.m. so we start work in earnest, for how long I could not say, but I do not think it will be longer than 2 to 3 months before both horses men will need a rest. I received a good batch of Australian mail today also saw an old friend viz T Jansan.The aeroplanes have been very quiet today. Wind blowing in the direction of the German Trenches, so there is no need of fear of gas attack tonight. This is a thing which we all have to watch carefully, as one breath without the helmet knocks you over the second means death.Things in general are very satisfactory if they proceed along the same lines as the last few days fighting, the war will probably end much sooner than it is generally anticipated. The German prisoners all seem to be full up of it.
