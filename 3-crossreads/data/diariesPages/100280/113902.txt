15th Am taking over orderly sergeant for a while, it is a rotten job for you have to be so particular about things you are tied down so.
Rather cooler weather today we could do with a good fall of rain.
16th yesterday 3 Germans got away from this camp, we have quite a number here working you know.
We also have a lot of "conscientious objectors", they look a miserable looking crowd, just the sort of people one would couple with "wowsers" such people
