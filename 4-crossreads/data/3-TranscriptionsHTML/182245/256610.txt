<p>APRIL 1917</p>
<p>5 THURSDAY</p>
<p>A beautiful fine sunny day.</p>
<p>We are getting a bit like rabbits</p>
<p>when a light is flashed on</p>
<p>them at night, now when the</p>
<p>sun comes out, it dazzles</p>
<p>us &amp; we cant see. Cleaning</p>
<p>headstalls all day. Had</p>
<p>nothing else to do so polished</p>
<p>them up with boot polish</p>
