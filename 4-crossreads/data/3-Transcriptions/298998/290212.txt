<p>Wounded prisoners, despite inattention and maltreatment fare better than men captured unwounded. They of course are employed in Reprisal camps. My suffering is inconsiderable when, compared with the horrors and tortures imposed upon those men; I sincerely hope some of these will, when liberated give a full account of their experiences. No doubt many will be glad to refrain from speaking or writing of their horrible life in Germany.</p>
<p>18th-25th. I received a clothing parcel on the 18th and a grocery on the 23rd. the latter is the second food parcel I have received since capture.

The Barrack is infested with vermin and this coupled with the repulsive stench from wounds, is insufferable. Despite my eagerness to talk with the boys, I made a speedy exit. 30th. The Russian Surgeon informed me that my operation was arranged for the 2nd of October. He tells me that my knee will be opened and although the operation entails considerable danger to the patella and arteries it should</p>
