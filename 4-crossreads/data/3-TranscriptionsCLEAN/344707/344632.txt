1916Off the coast of Algeria again quite hot , did some big gun practice [indecipherable] ours - Understand we are to go to - first this will be interesting Must be many letters waiting for me inEgypt. - We have the usual Gymnasium of mechanicals riding horses etc We have many different regiments on board - One Scotch officer at Gibraltar when I admired his kilts offered to lend them to me to be photographed in, he said they cost  5 in Scotland. He thought he was doing me a great favor
