<p>28/10/17 Modane<br/>Awoke at 8 o'c to find myself well among the Alps and running down between Aix les Bains and Modane. The tops of the mountains had snow on them and parallel with the railway ran a river full of big stones &ndash; as far as I could make out the Sere. The route was very pretty as we ran through valleys and gorges, sheer heights going up on either side. On top of one snowy height was perched a stone building probably religious in nature. Came into Modane about 10 and changed trains there. An English RTO. and a naval and military staff. After leaving here we passed through the long Mt Cenis tunnel and on coming out found ourselves among enormous peaks and about 6 inches of snow on the ground. At Modane we changed to Central European train. Noticed here a soldier of the Bersaglieri with feathered hat. Just before going through</p>
