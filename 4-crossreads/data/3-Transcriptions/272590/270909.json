<p>Signals &ndash; Gilbert Frankau</p>
<p>The hot wax drips from the flares<br/>On the scrawled pink forms that litter<br/>The bench where he sits:  the glitter<br/>Of stars is framed by the sandbags atop of the dugout stairs<br/>And the lagging watch hands creep<br/>And his cloaked mates murmur in sleep &ndash;<br/>Forms he can wake with a dick &ndash;<br/>And he hears as he plays with the pressel switch, the strapped receiver click,<br/>On his ear that listens, listens,<br/>And the candle-flicker glistens<br/>On the rounded brass of the switchboard, where the red wires cluster thick.</p>
<p>Wires from the earth, from the air;<br/>Wires that whisper and chatter<br/>At night when the trench-rats patter<br/>And nibble among the rations, and scatter back to their lair;<br/>Wires that are never at rest,<br/>For the linesmen tap them and test,<br/>And ever they tremble with tone.</p>
