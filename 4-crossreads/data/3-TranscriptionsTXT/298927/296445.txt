The Lt has lost the balance of his senses and has become a military maniac & was taken away to-day.
14th  Sep.  Got 56 hours leave to London.  Went on the Thames to Kew Gardens.  On Sunday there was an air raid scare, but nothing happened.We saw some of the damage done by the previous raids. One of the lions at Cleopatra's needle was badly mutilated.All damage is immediately repaired and a week later you would not think there had been a raid.
