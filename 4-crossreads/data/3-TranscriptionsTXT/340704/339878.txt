December 1917Monday 3Still at Enab - Turks shelled road and dump. I had narrow escape going to water shell passed very close and burst 10 yds behind me. No damageNothing doing, very cold north wind.
Tuesday 4Went from Enab to Regt with despatches expecting to get parcels but was disappointed. Regt camped on nice spot 9 miles back near village of Artuf.We have fire every night and Tommies and Scotchmen flock round and yarn over past experiences. Londoners very humorous, Surprised at us pinching wood and cutting olive trees.
