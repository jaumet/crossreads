Its an interesting place, Plenty of room, the grounds are particularly extensive & well laid out but have been allowed to go wild a bit though that makes no difference to us.  The trees are planted thickly & there are acres of them so that the shade they cat is dense & looks cool.  The sea breeze is fresh after the hot air of Cairo & its a treat to walk along the sea front.
