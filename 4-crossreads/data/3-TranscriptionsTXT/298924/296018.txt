Wednesday 5 February 1919RafaN.Z.M.R. Brigade Races, busy writing diary.  Cold little better.  Letter from Laura thinking I was in Australia.Lost money at Races but even so life here is cheaper than Cairo & if the men do gamble better to keep them employed than hankering after the Flesh pots of Egypt & breaking away.
