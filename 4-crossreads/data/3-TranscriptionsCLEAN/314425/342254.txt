  
 diamonds & some butter scotch, 1 pkt of tobacco was from Annie and the other  from Curtis. 
 Tuesday Oct 8. 1918. 1526. A dirty wet morning but it was finer in the afternoon. There is only routine work to do today such as feeding and grooming the animals. Most of the Transports had a gay time last night for there is beauchamp beer and wine to be had in this village. Capt Ceruty who is now O.C. of the Transports addressed the men this evening prior to paying them. We are not to take any notice of the numerous rumours that are in circulation or assist by repeating them. Some of 
 them owed their origin to German propaganda as the one that Turkey surrendered. He had given credience to this as it came from official circles nevertheless it was false & its origin is a bit of a mystery. Other rumours about the37 battalion were not to be believed. The heads knew nothing at present. As the Batln was not below strength A & B companies would be made into one & called No 1 company & C. D No 2. The Transport strength was to be reduced in men Limbers and mules and horses. The number of  hacks were also to be reduced.
