  
 12/4/18 There are lots of things that happen that we hear of and forget. There are memories that we cherish, there are those that bring regret, There are tender recollections that the darker hours console, But there's thoughts of bitter sorrows that will grip your very soul. We'd a colonel in command of us, the gruff old veteran brand, Beloved by his battalion and the idol of the band The boys all called him Billjim for he'd proved himself their friend And swore that where he'd lead them they would follow to the end.
