<p>Outside of the reef "Wolf" hove-to and sent "Wolfchen" in to the Jap. with instructions to "beat it quickly while the going is good" (or it's equivalent in German.)   Just as "Wolfchen" had disappeared a heavy wind and rain squall came up &ndash; a dhow in the offing was beaten about badly and the Germans were very anxious for the safety of their loved "Wolfchen".    She finally appeared, a moving speck in the squall-clouds, and when she was finally on deck pilot and observer shook hands.   They had had a narrow squeak.   "Wolf" steamed off on a S.W. course at full speed.</p>
