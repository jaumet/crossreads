  
 life on board I will endeavor to be as brief as possible.  The Bugle  After a good  nights sleep  days excitement I was tired & slept like a top & awoke at the Bugle Call at 6 am 30/1/17 after rolling my blankets in my hammock I put them away in the place set apart. The Weather being fine but still a large number were sick & laying about every where. As there were no Parade I amused myself playing Draughts & Cards & walking about as I am a fair Sailer I symphasised with my less fortunate friends. I must say a good word for the Catering, we could not wish for better food, we get Sausages for breakfast & stew in turns also Porridge & Roast Beef or Mutton with Peas or Haricot Beans & Potatoes foe Dinner for Tea it is Bread & Jam & Butter
