<p>a gentleman travelling also to Glasgow.</p>
<p>From this time the journey became very interesting &amp; the two soldiers practically put themselves into the hands of the civilian who being "full" of local knowledge (&amp; we afterwards heard a prominent man in one of the "Arms" of the Service, proved very entertaining and also to their further enjoyment, very hospitable.</p>
<p>The arrival of the train at Glasgow was delayed at least two hours &amp; a half owing to the presence of two Red Cross trains immediately in "front', &amp; both the soldiers were making conjectures as to their chances of obtaining accommodation at an hotel with a moderate but not a low tariff.</p>
<p>Upon appealing to the "civilian" he admitted that Glasgow shortly after midnight was not the best place in the world for strangers to obtain accommodation in a conservative Hotel especially when travelling without luggage so leaving it, at his own request to him, on arrival he drove them round in a taxicab to an hotelkeeper he knew instructed the night porter to wake him up &amp; by giving his word that he was recommending two Australian soldiers who could conduct themselves properly obtained for the soldiers, accommodation &amp; attendance of the very best at a very reasonable price. From the outside the place would hardly be looked upon as an Hotel, but inside it was very comfortable.</p>
<p>Naturally the civilian was very warmly thanked, but he only wished, the soldiers, to "play the game" as he had passed his word for their good conduct.</p>
<p>The next day the two soldiers spent the whole of their time on the "Clyde" taking advantage of the very last trip of a steamer, making regular passage, for at least six months.</p>
<p>Apart from the pleasure, the clear picture of the stupendous effort, that Britain was making to combat the foe, would have been reward sufficient for the journey if it began &amp; ended</p>
