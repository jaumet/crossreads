 150 miles from here there is an Oasis with old Roman Wells- timbered for about 50 feet & then bored & cased with wooden pipes the wood is still quite sound a sort of Sycamore- 600 B.C.  As very little timber is now growing in this part of Egypt these Wells must be 1000's of years old.  Artesian & warm. Visited an old Monastry 1600 years old occupied by Copts who had to build strong holds to save themselves from the Mohammedans. So very old & so very dirty no wonder the Children died. VERDUN seems to be the place of affairs at present   We only get what news is good for us
