<p>shortly.  I am unable to write now, so I suppose everybody will be worrying.</p>
<p>11.3.16 Saturday<br/>Had a very tiring day being in the saddle for the whole of the 24 hours.<br/>The Convoy was engaged in transporting troops baggage from Helmieh to Zeitoun.  Supply Section leaving tomorrow for Ferry Post &amp; Serapeum, &amp; consequently we are again losing some more of our very good Comrades.<br/>Our travelling Kitchen arrived &amp; it is a very good one.  It cost &pound;250 but I fancy it is well worth it.<br/>I had much pleasure in receiving a batch of letters yesterday, although there was none from Nina &amp; consequently I felt very downhearted, but better luck next time.</p>
<p>12.3.16 Sunday<br/>Again unable to go to Church Parade.  I had to take a Convoy through Cairo to-day &amp; experienced a good deal of trouble with my Horse, which shys at Motor &amp; Tram Cars.<br/> It is a nice little hack</p>
