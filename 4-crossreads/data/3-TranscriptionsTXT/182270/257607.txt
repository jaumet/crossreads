 WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1919. 
 Fine with cold S wind. Put the 
 Mountain ewes &amp; lambs into Middle 
 and lopped for them in morning. 
 Darby finished cleaning out the 
 Mountain bore in&nbsp; aft &nbsp;morning &amp; 
 helped him put down the rods 
 and piping in afternoon. Tickle 
 helping at bore all day. 
 Darby cleaned it out to&nbsp; within  
 169 ft and after that it fell in 
 to much to do anything else with
