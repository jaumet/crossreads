 This was in shallow trench and after putting on our helmets we went through. Gas used was chlorine and sulphur dioxide liquefied in steel cylinders. Going through  we  I had some sprayed on my hand but I wasn't at all affected although it would have killed us if we were exposed. We were inspected by a general then and went home after having a cold bath and exchanging our old clothes for clean ones. very cold but invigorating. Got some tea and plenty of food and waited about until about 4 when the pioneers had to go into camp. We marched about 3 miles with our kits and got a blanket when we got here &ndash; plenty of grub fair place to camp. Only 3 miles from the firing line. Sailly was occupied by the germans and the big church is smashed to pieces. Mail leaves to-night. 10.6.16 After tea we went for a walk but couldn't get into town without a passed so went the other way passing successfully two guards and walked into a little cottage apparently into a front room where the family were having tea. We drew up to the peat fire and got milk coffee and biscuits and had a long chat with the old grand father and mother who had their little grand children there. All taking beer for tea which every house sticks in its cellar and our men drink gallons. The old gentlemen showed us a photo of himself in the French infantry and we paid our two pence and departed having fully enjoyed myself. plenty of aeroplanes and  yesterday  we saw our machines being shelled with shrapnel by the germans but our plane got off safely. 12.6.16 Slept fairly well although very cold and the guns kept us awake. Didn't get up till 7 and after breakfast we fell in at 9 and did a bit of rifle drill in the rain. Been raining all day and it is very cold and miserable. Dinner and rest of the day off. I read some French and finished letters in the afternoon. After tea I went up towards town and got some tobacco and matches &ndash; rotten stuff - . A girl came along this morning with a sort of horn and woke us up and came right in selling papers while we were lying at ease in bed. This morning an officer came round and got our trades for working later in the workshops. I am a motor mechanic and fitter and turner. Just got notice to be ready for the trenches at 5.30 in the morning to dig a sap out of the front line of trenches getting  back at about 3. Rather dangerous I expect. One food ration to be taken and we get our helmets of steel each 6 lbs in the morning before going out.
