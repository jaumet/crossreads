 WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 1919. 
 Fine. Got letters from Scrivener 
 &amp; Agent General in support of 
 my application for going home 
 &amp; gave them in at H.Q. Alan &amp; I 
 &amp; Tommy Fenwicke went out to 
 see Capt Lawson at Finsbury 
 Park in the afternoon. It was 
 a good drive out in the car.
