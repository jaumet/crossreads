1/12/17 Mt. Kemmelldevious winding roads across muddy byways. From there went on to Houpoutre just outside Poperinghe and had a good hot bath there. Rode down to the 3rd Casualty Clearing Station and in the cemetery found Bertie's grave after much searching. An icy shower of rain was drenching the graves - they pack the dead close together in their beds. From here we went through Wippenhoek and Westoutre. Darkness came on as we trotted along quiet muddy roads only meeting now and then a stray motor lorry or a peasant coming back from work. Women bareheaded and sturdy trudging along with their heads down. All plain looking bar one who called out "Hullo, darling" much to the amusement of the groom. In the little villages the churchyards are full of tawdry wooden crosses - better ones are not worth putting up for the little while the title in the grave is allowed to rest in these lands. After mess went to H.Q. Euchre party. Pay night. Drunks.
