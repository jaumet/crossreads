<p>Found the Train in the same place it is over 3 months since we arrived here.<br/>3-3-17. Still in Albert. Two or three HEAVY shells lobbed quite close this morning disturbing our Ordnance Stores &amp; wounding a Warrant Officer &amp; a Sgt. They did make a clatter I assure you.<br/>The germans are retreating along our front &amp; our chaps are giving chase with good success.<br/>6-3-17. The above Warrant Officer succumbed to his wounds on the 4th. A fine chap he was too Owens by name.<br/>In last nights orders my rank (Cpl) was confirmed from 1-3-17, anniversary of the formation of the Train.<br/>7-3-17. 25 to-day gee whiz. Received 6 letters yesterday but none to-day.</p>
