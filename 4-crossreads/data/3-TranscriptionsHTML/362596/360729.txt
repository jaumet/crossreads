<p>Write whenever you get time as I am always pleased to get your letter and glad to be able to tell you anything about Camp life, but when we are on the other side we can only say we are well so you need not look for a long letter from us as they are all read before they are sent. So I must now conclude with love to all.<br/>I remain<br/>Your Aff. bro<br/>Clarence<br/>Signalling Depot<br/>Millitary Camp<br/>Liverpool</p>
