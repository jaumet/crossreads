<p>chopped it down and made an &quot;Anzacolite&quot; out of it; but I think it has cured me too! Anyhow I am sending along the K.O.C. and a copy of what I sent them for you to judge and hope you wont think too badly of me. Remember I&#39;m quite sound in mind again now! Am down at Port Said Rest camp and have been here just a week. The dentist has been fixing up my teeth and was to have had them done in time for next week&#39;s conscription, which is held on Tuesdays, but owing to him being ill the last few days my teeth wont be finished in time, so I may have to stay another week. Dont mind much if I do, because the Regt is not doing anything and this a grand place for a spell. Tons of tucker and a tonic three times a day to make you eat it. Does me! &nbsp;I was very pleased to receive a six page letter from you the other day and hope you will keep repeating the dose. You had a great trip up round Maitland alright. I know some of that country too. Have been on that Greeta&nbsp;railway and went down the Standford&nbsp;Murther (I think it was) coal mine; but the big strike was on at the time and none of the mines were working. Glad to hear you are going in for chemistry</p>
