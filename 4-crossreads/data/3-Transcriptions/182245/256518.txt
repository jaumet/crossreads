<p>3 WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Fine, but cold &amp; cloudy. Took the</p>
<p>horses all out for walking exercise&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the morning while they made</p>
<p>new horse lines for them. Fixing up</p>
<p>harness &amp; grooming horses in</p>
<p>the afternoon.</p>
<p>The name of the village we</p>
<p>are quartered near is</p>
<p>&quot;Strazeele&quot;. Did not hear any</p>
<p>guns firing today, but suppose</p>
<p>it was because of the wind.</p>
