also to Gen Burgess the present C.R.A., the final recommendation  for honours lies with the Divisional Commander.  For instance yesterday I had to refuse three recommendations made by my C.R.A. simply because I had not a sufficient number of decorations allotted me by higher authority to make it possible to include them.
The Australian troops are still brilliantly successful in their operations and I am very proud of my Division because of its recent fine work in the capture of Mt St Quentin.
Please accept my kindest regardsVery sincerely yoursCharles Rosenthal
