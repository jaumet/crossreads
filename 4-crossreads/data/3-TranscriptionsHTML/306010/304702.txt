<p>Thurs. 21" Dec. 16 10 a.m.<br/>We had a very foggy morning about 5 days ago so that when there was a loud explosion about 10 a.m. nobody could see anything. At any rate we found a big piece of embankment blown away between the railway &amp; our camp. Whether it was a bomb, shell etc. no one knows.<br/>Got a "shove up" a couple of days ago to <u>Staff Sergeant</u> dating back to 28"Nov. Had been a Sergt about 14 mos. Am now Chief Clerk with a staff of 2 Sergts, 3 Cpls &amp; 8 Ptes. Will be taking charge of a portion of the Hospitals wards as Section Wardmaster in a few days.<br/>The day before yesterday we had a fair fall of snow. I was out in it and very soon was covered with soft a white mantle.<br/>In the evening the snow thawed and the roads became as slippery as glass. (109)</p>
