for a Barwick so he came out of the dugout George was surprised when I told him, he had no idea it was Stan who had been killed, at any rate he another officer gave me all the information they could the map reference.
Heaven only knows how they will take it all home, they will be cut up properly, poor Stan could be ill spared, of the 3 of us I reckon he was the best, to think that he is the first to go, though now he has gone Len I might follow quickly, for the lucks been broken. I'm out for revenge for the future, God help the German that comes into my hands its he I for it.
Stan was killed on October the 8th just close to "Reims Wood" between Zonnebeke Passchendale, in this stunt George Vaughan won a M.C. Bill Barwick a M.M. Bill I could not see as he was away at a school on a 5 weeks course, I also saw Eric Salter he has a commission in the 11th Battalion.
