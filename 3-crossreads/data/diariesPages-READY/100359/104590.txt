They got anything but complimentary and "Ross" hit Jemmy on the jaw. Then Jemmy hit "Ross" in the ribs; and Ross stopped the fight to put his boots on. I don't know what is wrong with this place 2 of C. Section had a scrap yesterday. We had a stroll round the village. It is a very pretty little place, but is badly knocked about by shell fire. There is a canal running just behind our baths. Big motor barges travel along it, some carrying blue metal and timber and barbed wire for the roads and trenches others are fitted up as hospital ships and carry the wounded away to the various hospitals.
Friday 4th
The day of our departure. All mighty sorry. A party of R.A.M.C. (55th F. Amb.) arrived and took over the Baths. There were some very touching scenes when the hour of our departure arrived. "Towny" was mighty sorry sorry to leave "Darkey" "Bricky" was very popular, and I think the whole bloomin? crowd in the laundry kissed him. Lieut. Macintosh came away in charge of us. We left the Laundry about 10 and arrived back at Fort Rompu about 12.30. Here we stayed for dinner. Back to the old B.B. B. We left about 2.30 and after a very pleasant jaunt through the country we arrived at the village of Douglieu at about 4.30. It is a pretty little spot but is very quiet. We are billeted at a farm, where there are 2 of the dirtiest women I ever met. They are Flemish and more like Huns than French People. We are sleeping next to a pigsty and the aroma is very high. After tea we went for a stroll down the village. Paid a visit to the old Church which was used by the Huns as a Hospital but when the Tommies arrived and drove them out they poured petrol all over it and fired it. It is absolutely gutted only the outer walls remain standing. The old padre was there and told us all about it. He also gave us photos of the Church, which he autographed.
