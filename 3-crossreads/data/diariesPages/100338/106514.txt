good it was they might have stayed behind, It was absolutely the worst march music that I have ever marched to. It was impossible to keep step with it, it was also very tiring. I am now settled down in No 2 Company and expect to be attached to a boat roll in a day or two. This camp is much the same as the last one for comfort, but not as good in other respects.

Monday 28th April
To-day I was selected for a boat Roll for Repatriation to Australia. If my name is not taken off the list beforehand, I will be leaving on or about the second of May by the “S.S. Leicestershire", and should arrive home about the middle of June.

I am going to report to the Doctor to-morrow because I have a slight rash breaking out on the body, which I think is “Scabies". I shall have time to get it cured before the boat leaves and thereby run no risk of missing it and being disappointed like I was when I got the “Flu"
