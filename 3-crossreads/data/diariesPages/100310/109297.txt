5/9/17 Campagne 
Marched out to Le Biberou at 8.30 and carried out a tactical exercise. General Plumer of the 2nd Army was present. A white little man full of honours and monocled. His comments and questions were very much to the point and highly valuable to have. All officers assembled after the operation. A lovely fine morning. The woods are full of nuts and blackberries and the men killed a hare which was hiding in the undergrowth. The 7th Bde were working just behind us. In the afternoon had a sleep and gave the men a half holiday. Met Jack on the grounds before lunch ? very pleasant riding along. Took two summaries of evidence for Court Martial cases. Our planes the last few days have been doing a lot of squadron flying have a landing place near the ancient Abbaye de Woestine. The crops about are now well garnered to barns stocks in the vicinity here. Reg came in for a yarn during the early part of the evening.
