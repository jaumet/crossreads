 &amp;  Lt, Campling were killed &amp;   Lt. Barlow wounded is to put it mildly indeed. I had to withdraw the company from the front trenches at once &amp;   spell the men for some days. Hardened soldiers, though they are, they felt their commander's death as though they had lost a father. 
 He had called his officers into his dugout to confer with the, &amp;  issue his orders when a shell smashed through. Fortunately, your son was killed instantly, but Lt. Campling lingered for some hours. Both officers were buried next day with Military honours (June 15th) &amp;  crosses erected by the men. Lieut McCallum, &amp;  Harper despatched the valises, etc to you. I can write no more, but believe me the officers &amp;  men of this battalion grieves with you  in your great loss &amp;  extend their deepest sympathy to you &amp;   yours. And none so sincerely or so deeply as Yours sorrowfully R.F. FitzGerald
