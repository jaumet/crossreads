  
 After tea Witt & I walked up town and posted letters.  When we came back the operator from the Glengyle a large boat lying at the other side of the dock, had just come aboard to have a look at our gear.  He was profoundly interested in it, liking it much more than he does Marconi gear which he has to work.  Saturday 7th August 1915.   Raining on and off throughout the day.  Went ashore after dinner, but stayed only a short time.  Raining heavily after tea so went to bed.  Sunday 8th August 1915.   Miserable sort of morning but got up & went to 8.30 Mass & Communion.  Not a very large congregation present.   Rained on & off during the day
