6/9/16
London. Went down to Buckingham Palace and then had a look at Pall Mall coming to the St James Palace in time to see the ceremony of the changing of the guard. Band in scarlet uniforms and busbies but the guards (Scots today) were in khaki. Some new men evidently ? Australians could turn out a better guard for smartness in rifle exercises. The slow march is effective. Then to Westminster Abbey to soak in the glories of the dear old place once more and then to the 3rd London General arranged for field kit to be sent up there from Base. Bazely Allan and the others gone. Spent afternoon with Jim Bird. Returning to town went up to Bank then walked down Fleet St. to ?Ye Olde Chesyre Cheese" ? a dear old inn stuck away in wine Court ? an old haunt of Johnson Boswell and quite unchanged. Old English waiters, old curtained ?pews", candles, old fittings discussed the celebrated pudding a mug of ale. Walked down Strand and then took tube to my hotel
