<p>June 1916<br/>1st &ndash; Was the only bomb out of eight to do damage. 3rd killed a camel others went wide. However it was enough. Four killed outright, three died shortly afterwards &amp; another died after leg had been amputated. Leg in frightful condition knee cap &amp; thereabouts shattered into fragments the largest being about an inch. Another had half jaw &amp; face blown off, another had deep wound in buttock, breaking pelvis &amp; injuring internally. May be peritonaeum only or may have been intestines. Rather pathetic when putting him on operating table. Poor beggar, with a very poor chance of living said, "Don't lose my tunic, Matey its got a photo of my wife &amp; children in the pocket of it" Hope he survives. In terrible pain. He &amp; man with face not expected to live. Treated 21 with anaesthetics &amp; about three without Number of compound &amp; complicated<br/>1st &ndash; fractured &amp; some very bad wounds. They were all nasty &amp; some hit in about eight or ten places. One chap was hit on top of head, both arms R. side of abdomen, thigh &amp; below knee. Had two operating tables going hard from 6.15 am to 5.30 pm. Long operations in the morning. Did not get any breakfast &amp; by good luck managed to get a drink of poor tea &amp; some bully &amp; bread. Kept the sides from touching that was all. Cleaned us roughly after tea. About 40 horses killed &amp; reports say about 60 wounded but a V.C said they had only 13 to treat. Probably others slight wounds only. Scattered in all directions. Bomb that killed a camel &amp; bowled a nigger over fell about 100 yards off camp. Evidently tried to bomb NZs, <strike>only</strike> also &amp; missed. Turned MG on to Railhead as well as our camp. Did no damage with it. Antics of some of our men very funny</p>
