the Capt kept going never looking back and there gradually appeared a gap between the Capt and myself which gradually widened until there was a good 80 yards separating us and the mob straggling out behind like a mob of sheep. It was too bad so I doubled forward to the Capt and told him that he was marching too fast for the men "too fast" he said, why can't they keep up, I suppose it is the Coy who are so tired, no it is not the Coy I said for the Bombers are in front of us and we naturally are not going to pass them, however he said no more and I dropped back and got all the Bombers and the Coy blocked up and marching properly only at a steadier pace, about 300 yards further on the Capt halted his men and when we came up he started to lecture us and then an argument started with a big chap
