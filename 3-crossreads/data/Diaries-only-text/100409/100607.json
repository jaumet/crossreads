Did not sleep too well. Woke up 4 am and immediately went on deck and could see Sydney light, also reflection of lights at Manly and Bondi. Got up 4.30 am and entered the heads about 6.30 am. Anchored in Watsons Bay when a Doctor came aboard and took our temperatures.
Boat left Watsons Bay about 9.30 am and tied up to the wharf about 10 or 10.30. Got off about 11 am when Muriel and Mrs Brown met me. Went with Muriel to PB's and saw them. Went out to Annandale just before tea and stopped there for the night.
