She has to go to Brighton to see about a job tomorrow so isn't going to Scotland tonight. Violet took Janet's ticket & got into uniform & went. Had the wind up fearfully till the conductor punched the ticket & then she was pleased with herself. We all saw her off. Am going with Janet tomorrow. 
 Wednesday 21 May 1919 Met Janet at 10.15 am at Victoria & we went to Brighton. Cost us 8/6 each 1st class & she got a refund of 12/7 1/2 for third class return ordinary. Arrived Brighton & found a place for lunch & then went down to the beach. All stones & not at all pretty. Not even as good as Adelaide beaches. Then on to a pier. Cost us 2d each. On the pier are theatres & orchestral places besides all sort of side shows. Then got a train & went out to the hospital. Janet went in while I walked about. She got her job & starts in a month. We then rushed back & had a fruit salad & ice each & got the train back to Victoria. Went out to Bermondsey to see Matron & had dinner with her then back to the flat for her parcels & then to the train. Got a good seat. Once again the guard stepped in & helped us. Real bonny day.
