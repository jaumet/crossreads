Thursday 21 MarchMorning at Grafton Galleries War Pictures. Extremely good & interesting. After Hyde Pk. Met another chap & spend afternoon interestingly. Instead of meeting Bert Will only met Bert also on leave. All off to Scotland.
Got new tunic - fixed colours had tea, visited Ciro's. Then off to Kings Cross being warned of an air raid on the way.
Got good seats, left for Edinburgh about 10.30. Pretty crook with biliousness. Met mate of [Korah?] Les & Will in carriage.
