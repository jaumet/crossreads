"RAMADAN"
RAMADAN, 1 month of fasting for the Turksby day & all MOSLEMS [indecipherable] tomorrow. They must not even drink water but they have a great spread at sundown & feed all night & if we let them will sleep by day. At the end of the month they are supposed to be most vicious & best time for them to attack. Let 'em.
We had hopes of 1914 even getting leave to Australia but I see it can't be did.
Forgive the Blot but fountain Pens are erratic at times - fortunately, we always have sand to blot with.
