To my Mother
So your baby has sailed away to warHe could not resist the callAnd your heart is sad, but proud to knowThat you have given the nation your all
The three that you nursed in childhoodWho to manhood now have grownThe three your castles were built onAnd the dreams we have never known
Sacrifice is a duty of warThat mothers have sadly learntAnd prouder have a soldier sonThan keep a coward spurned
You must feel proud to think nowThat your duty has been obeyedAnd three of your sons were fightingIn the name Australians made.

To my friends mother
I realize your love, friendOf which you often speakA mother's love is sacred,Tho' her son be strong or weak
And I know the bond is strengthenedWhen we are far away,Mother's love is telepathyAnd through this bond they pray
For the baby they reared to manhoodFor he is their baby still.Striving in a nation's crisis,Manhood's duty to fulfill.
We are helping the helplessIn the cruellest of all warsWhilst mother brushes the tear awayAnd helps in the needful cause.
I have a mother like you friendAnd my feelings are just the same,It is up to us to reward their loveAnd make them proud of our name.
