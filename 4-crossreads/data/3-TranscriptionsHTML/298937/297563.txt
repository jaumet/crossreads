<p>Sergt. Horrocks was up here last week, but I can't imagine it to be true, or not Herbert at any rate, for he would have found me easily.<br/>Letters are again slack;  have not had any for some time.<br/>Went to town again yesterday &amp; met Nobes (I with Molloy).<br/>Spent nearly 100 piastres in the afternoon &amp; evening &amp; nothing to show for it.<br/>But it was a long time to be at Maadi without going in, so it can't be helped.</p>
