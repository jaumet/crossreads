<p>from cover to cover.  They were simply hungry for mails, but certainly not depressed.  My experience of the Australian soldier is that the more formidable his difficulties the more admirable he appears to all who have anything to do with him.  For example, take a soldier whose letter was received at head-quarters yesterday.  He has been in the infantry for two years when his thigh was shattered by a bomb, so that, apparently, he was unable to be of any further use.  He wrote that he wanted to get back again.  It seemed to him that he was exactly suited for driving one of the armoured "tanks."  Thus he would be able to see the very thick of the fighting, in spite of being unable to walk, which he considered would be no drawback in working the "tank."</p>
<p>The following extract from London Gazette, dated 25th September, 1916, is published for general information.</p>
<p>War Office,<br/>25th September, 1916.</p>
<p>The following despatch has been received by the Secretary of State for War from General Sir Archibald Murray, Commander-in-Chief, Egyptian Expeditionary Force:&ndash;</p>
<p>General Head-quarters,<br/>Egyptian Expeditionary Force,<br/>1st June, 1916.</p>
<p>Sir, &ndash; I have the honour to submit a report on the operations of the Force under my command from the date on which I assumed command to the 32st May, 1916.</p>
<p>1. On 9th January, 1916, I arrived I Cairo, and, on the following day, took over the command of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force from General Sir C. C. Monro, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., who had himself arrived from Mudros but a few days before.  At that date the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was in a state of transition as regards its larger component, the Dardanelles Army.  On the night of the 8th-9th January this Army had completed its successful evacuation of Cape Helles; its units were still concentrated at Mudros and Imbros awaiting transport to Egypt, where all the Force, excluding the Salonica Army, had been ordered to concentrate.  Meanwhile, a portion of the Force, which had been set free by the earlier evacuation of the Suvla Bay and Anzac positions, had already arrived in Egypt, where it had come under the command of General Sir John Maxwell, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.  The concentration of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, for instance, was practically complete, and the 53rd Division was occupied in operations on the Western Frontier of Egypt.  General head-quarters of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force were temporarily established in Cairo.</p>
<p>The instructions which I had received from the Secretary of State for War placed under my command all organized formations then in Egypt, or on their way to Egypt, with the exception of such troops as might be considered necessary for the defence of Egypt, with the exception of such troops as might be considered necessary for the defence of Egypt and the Nile Valley against attack from the west, or for maintaining order in the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta.  The function assigned to me was that of protecting Egypt against attack from the east, and the westward limit of my command was roughly fixed by a line running north and south approximately 5 miles west of the Suez Canal.  The British Force at Salonica was also placed under my general supervision.</p>
<p>2. During the period under review, in addition to the extensive military preparations required for the defence of the eastern front, the amount of purely administrative work thrown on all sections of my Staff has been extremely heavy.  The exigencies of the Gallipoli campaign had placed the Force under my command in a state of serious disorganization.  Some units were in Egypt, others on the sea, others in Aegean ports. It was not until the end of February that the last units of the Dardanelles Army reached Egypt.  Every day for over six weeks shiploads of troops, guns,</p>
