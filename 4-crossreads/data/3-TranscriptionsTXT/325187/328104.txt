 [Thursday 28 December 1916] 
 Rum issued last night, the first for many days-  Bought a very poor fowl &amp; 2 Eggs for 2/- from the Natives in El Arish. Forage &amp; Rations are being landed in surf boats from Steamers outside-  No bay or harbour of any sort.  The Navy had bombarded the Fort to ruins- reminds one of ANZAC. Tin of Kero from Turks proves to be Cylinder oil but it helps boil the Billy &amp; a pair of gloves from a Turkish Officer are keeping my hands warm.  I was  not  away Collecting Papers &amp; Documents perhaps of Military value  to get much LOOT .
