<p>6th April 1918</p>
<p>My dear Father. I have not had a chance to post letters for some time so will write another one now and post the two together. I received your letter of 3rd April last night and was jolly glad to hear of the good season you were having - also of Hal having passed his exams so well. There is no doubt Hal is a brainy chap and will certainly do justice to a university training - and science ought to be a course that would just suit him. I hope he writes to me and tells me all about things. I often wish I could be studying things nyself while I&#39;m over here - one seems to be wasting so much time - and we often have time to read but <s>it</s> generally dont have any books then. I haebeen trying to learn the theory of Cross breeding and Mendelism etc, there are some chaps here who have studied it, and it seems wonderfully interresting but a person wants books and then</p>
