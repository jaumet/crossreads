 " Only a Letter " 
 Youre looking tired &amp; weary, And you feel you cant be cheery. And from your dirty trench you cannot roam Theres a sight to stir your heart, Makes all care &amp; pain depart A letter from the dear old folks at home 
 Maybe its from your brother Or your old grey haired mother Or sweetheart true who sends the welcome line But it sets you at your ease, When that message oe'r the seas Just tells you all the folk at home are fine, 
 Theres the other side to tell And it don't sound half as well It seems to give your heart a sudden wrench When the mail is given out And you find without a doubt Youre the only one forgotten in the trench 
 In your throat a lump will rise, And tears start to your eye's You wonder why on earth they fail to write
