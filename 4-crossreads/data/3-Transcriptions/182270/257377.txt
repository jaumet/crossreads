<p>1016 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6</p>
<p>Fine &amp; beautifully warm. Played</p>
<p>gmes for a bit &amp; then lay in</p>
<p>the Sun &amp; baked. It was just</p>
<p>glorious. Passed H.M.S Challenger</p>
<p>in afternoon. Saw birds today</p>
<p>for the first time following us, also</p>
<p>a whale &amp; some flying fish.</p>
<p>Had a impromtu Jazz band</p>
<p>on deck at night &amp; it was</p>
<p>a good break in the monotony</p>
<p>Days run 348 miles.</p>
