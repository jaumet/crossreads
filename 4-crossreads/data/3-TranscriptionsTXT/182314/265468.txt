 Col [Slane?] Col. Read are both desirous of forming a band for their Battalions &amp; I feel certain they will form good bands quicker, than under the present method; &amp; although they may not be so efficient as the present band, I am sure the moral effect will be felt throughout the four Battalions of the Brigade &amp; will lead to keener competition

 Yours sincerely
