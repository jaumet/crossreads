This is no doubt   largely due to the splendid sea-going qualities of the ship.  We were unfortunate enough to lose one man overboard, but he jumped over deliberately.  We heard last night that a boat had been torpedoed near Malta, not 100 miles from where we were, so we are very thankful to be here cruising about between Toulon & Marseilles waiting for morning.  We expect to disembark before mid-day & set out on our long train journey across France, some say to Rouen, others to Amiens.  I don't think any of them really know excepting that it is to be in the north of France: they say we have been allotted a sector on the River Somme, but I expect we shall not be really in it for some time to come, the men certainly require a lot of training before they are ready for the Job.  I believe we are to be billeted in the French villages & if this is correct I can hope to know some French by the time the campaign is over. Am hoping to get in touch with Rid & Leo soon after arriving at the Depot. You may have had, before you get this of mine, something much more decent from Wal, I do hope you have.  Evidently they did not stay in France at all but went straight to England for training there, and as he suggest may be there for some time. This letter of Wal's must have come by the same English mail that brought Rid's I think, only Rid's happened to be delivered this morning a delivery earlier.  Wal's cable from London on 12th April is really the most recent after all. Very much love dear Father & Mother Your very loving daughter Olive.
