contrast after the everlasting sand of Egypt. The three days spent on Lemnos were busy ones. The Bakery had been situated close to French Bakery a quarter of a mile from Mudros Bay. It was decided to move the Supply depot nearer to save transport. Accordingly ovens were moved and a party under a Sergeant detailed to bake Bread for Hospitals. The Bakery embarked aboard a Trawler and we had quite an exciting trip up to Imbros Island. The Skipper was on his first trip in those waters and when something came up a short distance off, a shout went up of Submarine. That old Boat screwed about in all directions for a time until we could hear a hoarse voice swearing royally, quite close to us, and in the very dim light we could see the outline of another Boat. Shortly after we narrowly missed the mines. One officer aboard an Imperial Major who was going to Anzac, and had come up from Alexandria with us had been asleep. (He never seemed to be without his eyeglass) I woke him and told him our Boat might be blown up. Thinking he would get the wind up I waited. He calmly adjusted that Eye Glass; looked at me a moment and said "Damitall, I suppose we shall get wet then". I shall always judge a man with an Eye Glass in future when I know him well.
