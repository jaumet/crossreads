for  a stroll. Went again through the woods to St Etienne. After having a cup of coffee, we went out of bounds, into the city. Feeling that we had to go very warily on this account not having a pass, we avoided the M.P.s as much as possible.
After having a look round we boarded a tram to get back to camp but it was so overcrowded that we decided to get off again.
We tried to hire a taxi. This was a fruitless search. Luckily an officer seeing our difficulty offered to give us a lift in his taxi which we readily accepted. We drove rapidly back to camp and arrived there a few minutes before "Lights Out".
April 20th. Thurs.Wrote a few letters in the Y.M. Hut. Went to the Hospital Concert this evening. Very slow and did not wait long.
April 22nd. Sat.Very wet weather these last few days. C, D and myself were entertained to tea by Mr Purvis. Had a very interesting talk with him.
Went to a Lecture later.
In the concert hall things were very amusing. A prize of a few cigarettes were given to the men who would sing a song first. No one seemed to take the bait until after a good deal of hesitation a youngster plucked up courage, mounted the platform and broke down in the middle of the song. This caused a great deal of amusement, especially so when Mr Purvis presented him with a box of cigarettes. This set the ball arolling and quite a number sang songs without the motive power of prize winning and quite a pleasant evening
