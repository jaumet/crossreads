Tuesday 18 September 1917.
On despatch messenger once again and today a deal of fooling around business. (Mismanagement again.) A busy day & late into evening also.
The dust today is terriffic, the worst day in this respect since arriving in Egypt.
At 8.30 when I took latest despatches to Brigade Hd Qrs the searchlignts of ours (Allies) could be plainly seen sweeping everywhere.
3rd & 4th Brigades moved out to the other side of Tel-el-Farah on the Waddy. Gazzeh.  Moving all day.
Geo. Kelley called on the way out with 12th Regt. 4th Brigade. I was out again on duty and missed him.
