As usual there are plenty of our planes hanging about.
Things have been fast furious this afternoon talk about mortar bombardments well we have had them this afternoon but for every bomb shell the Germans shot over they got 6 in return quite easily, we blew their barb-wire to pieces levelled their parapets in places but the greater part of the bombardment fell on the 2nd and 3rd lines it must have been a perefect Hell there, large pieces of timber etc were flying back all the while from Fritzs trenches, our bombardment stopped as suddenly as it started then old Fritz lets fly but every time he shot one of his big Minnewerfers over our boys
