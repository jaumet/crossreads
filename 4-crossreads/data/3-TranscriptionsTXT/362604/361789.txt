Dear Dad, Mum & George,
I am just scribbling a few lines as I am leaving here to-morrow for Fovant at the other end of the Plains whither Ellis has gone to get ready for Havre.  I have only just returned from Auntie & Uncle & Grandma where I had a lovely time.  The weather was very rough& I was sick crossing over but not when returning.  I have almost packed up now & then I'll be off in the morning.  Ellis is going to meet me at the other end.  Ernie Thomas is going with us, but Dick Toppin is staying here.  We will not be Staff Sergeants any more but that does not matter.  We may get one rank back later on.  I am sitting in the Theatre at Bulford waiting to see "Faust" played.  The weather has been very wet & rough lately, but I have been on Holidays so it did not matter.
