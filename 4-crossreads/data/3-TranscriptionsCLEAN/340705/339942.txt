  
 No news of interest, just the same old training principles which have found to be absolutely up to shit in a war like this.  Brigade & Divisional manoeuvres, a little Musketry, and a little night work.  It is all for the benefit of our reinforcements - the dinkums or the "comforts fund soldiers" as we call them. 
 Am writing to Mum & to H.T. this week.  Have received my Sheepskin, also another bonza parcel from the Stores.  So long for the present. 
 Ever your affectionate Eric.
