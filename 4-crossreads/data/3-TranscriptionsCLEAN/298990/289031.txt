  
 Ypres 2/10/16  During the morning all temporary NCOs were paraded for inspection by the C.O. and we went into the matter of permanent promotions.  In peace soldiering and at first in our AIF we used to choose our non.coms. almost entirely on a smart personal appearance but now we dont pay much attention to that but rather favour the "dags".  Give me  "dag" for any job that wants doing.  A wet cold day we did not stir outside once.  This hanging round in dugouts and billets where we are continually under hostile observation makes us soft.  It will be a relief to get back once more to our hut camp at Erie. 
 3/10/16  Wet and cold.  The Germans kept as quiet as we did and the only event here during the day was the arrival of 5 cases of backsheese for the men.  Read all day and yarned with Dr James. 
 4/10/16  Left early on horseback for 24th headquarters and sat on a courtmartial with Colonel Fitzgerald and [Sparrow?].  Dealt with two cases, one forgery the other disciplinary.  Returned during the afternoon.  Wet and sloppy.  Great activity is always behind the firing line.  Camps full of troops in huts, sawmills at work, transport lines, horses wagons mules  motor transport and a thousand and one odds and ends..  Each time one rides through the town here it is with fresh wonderment at the devastation and the completeness of the ruins.  After changing to the Belgian barracks for a bath in three or four tin dishes of very hot dubious water in an enamel bath and then changed completely into clean clothes , ready to go into trenches again.  Scheme now on foot for supply daily of clean socks.  One pair on the man, one on [indecipherable], one for the handwashing.
