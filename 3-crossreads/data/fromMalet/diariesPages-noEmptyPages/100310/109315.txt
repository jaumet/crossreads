16/9/17 Dominion Camp
Attended a conference at Bde H.Q. presided over by the General. A windy dusty day with a heavy bombardment during the morning. At 2.30 p.m. all the men came out of the huts and loaded up with their line kit wearing sandbags round their legs instead of puttees and looking very daggish in their steel helmets. At 3p.m. we moved down to busses on the road and the whole battalion was soon on wheels running up towards the line. We debussed at the Ypres asylum and I scattered my 700 men about in little parties to avoid the Guns and let them have their tea. A number of big guns were firing and up overhead there were plenty of planes. We stayed on this ground until 6 p.m. and then commenced forward movement with big intervals. It was hot and dusty going through Ypres and just before coming to the square we saw a dark pool some clothes and a few splinters all that was left of a bussload of people. As we quickly crossed the hated square we had a big shell whiz close over churn up some ruins out
