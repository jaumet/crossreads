Diary on Second Years Active Service
23.8.1916


[Page 4]
August 1916

It was while encamped at No. 1 Anzac reinforcement camp Val-de-Maison that my second year on active service opened on 23rd August 1916. On the afternoon of the 22nd the Battalion had to attend a Brigade parade at La Vicogne at which Gen Birdwood presided & decorated officers & other ranks with awards won in the recent fighting at Pozieres the second time. Next day the 24th, the Battalion lined up & marched to Gezaincourt where we stayed for a couple of days. On the 25th I walked to Doulens a distance of about a mile & a half & had a look around the town which is a fine big place & it was here where we entrained the next day. At 4 am on the 26th I had to march with a party to the railway at Doulens as guide on the train for my platoon & it was at 5am when the platoon entrained but never moved till 6.30am & we went in a northerly direction till we arrived at Coperinghe in Belgium our destination. We disentrained at 1 pm & formed up into column & had about a three mile march to Toronto Camp where we stayed in huts. On the 27th I received a rise in rank & was made Temporary Corporal. On the 28th I was detailed as Battalion orderly corporal & it was my first experience at that kind of work & the battalion also marched to Poperinghe that day & had a hot bath & change of under clothes. At 11 pm on the 29th the Gas alarm was given & when it was found that everything was clear I was detailed of as corporal of gas guard & dismounted at 6am next morning. It was late in the afternoon of the 30th that the Battalion lined up ready to move off to the firing line & we marched to a siding north of Poperinghe where we entrained.


[Page 5]
August & September 1916

Our train ride was very short & only lasted about twenty minutes & we disentrained at the southern end of the town of Ypres where guides met us. Our path was through the main streets of the town which is absolutely blown to atoms & there is no sign of civilians at all as the Huns still shell it with their big guns. It has been a fine city for the ruins of the Cloth Hall & numerous other big buildings are the only sights to be seen of the old city. At the far side of the town we had to go through a big archway known as Lille Gates in the City Wall then pass over a metal bridge which goes across a small lake. Our path then lay until we reached the reserve trenches a road crossing two Railways. We releived the Dublin Fus about midnight & remained in reserve trenches till following night. At 2pm on the afternoon of the 1st September I had to go to front line to have a look round platoons front & it was not till after dark that the company came to the front line. It had been raining for a couple of days previous & the mud & slush was knee deep in the front line & there was no shelter at all. Our platoon (No 4) was just to the left of Hill 60 & we remained in the firing line for 3 ½ days & were releived by "D" Coy on the morning of the 4th day & moved back to supports & while there we had to do ration fatigue of a night & Engineers fatigue of a day. The dug outs we were in, in supports were built in the sides of the cutting of the main Paris to Brussels railway line which is now a mass of shell holes & sand bag barrackades. The whole time the Battalion occupied the front line things were very quiet but the monotony was often broken by both sides opening out with


[Page 6]
September 1916

trench mortars & rifle grenades & Fritz uses one mortar weighing 120 lbs called "Miniwurfer which made a hole ten feet deep when it exploded. On the night of the 7th we were relieved from supports by the 1st Battalion & we moved back to reserve trench in Railway dug outs which were built like a big tunnel with two rows of wire bunks on each side under the railway line. On the afternoon of the 8th I was detailed off a corporal of Brigade Headquarters guard also in the Railway dug outs & it was for twenty four hours. On the night of the 10th I went with fatigue party to supports where we had to carry engineers & miners’ gear from Jackson dump to communication trench & winter quarters & on the night of the 11th I was again detailed off with Engineers fatigue in communication trenches on revetting work & worked till 3am next morning.

On the morning of the 12th I had to go with an officer & four other men to Ypres to look up route so as to guide the platoon out. At dusk of the same day I had to go to the railway at Ypres & meet the Tenth Battalion & guide a platoon of them to our trench & when they had taken over I had to lead our platoon to the train. Our ride was short & disentrained near Poperinghe & marched to Dominion camp & when we turned in it was 2.30 am next morning.

We were allowed to sleep till dinner time & in the afternoon I was detailed off as Company Orderly Corporal which I had for four days. Early morning on the 18th the company had to march to the first Australian Divisional Baths & had hot bath & change of underclothing. On the 22nd I went through an instruction in


[Page 7]
September 1916

Mills hand Grenades & also threw live bombs. On the 23rd I went through a course of Aeroplane Contact Signalling & learned how to signal to planes & vice-versa. Next morning 24th a Brigade Church Parade was held & General Birdwood & Mr. Fisher were present & the General decorated officers & men with awards which had been recently won & after church parade I went for a hot bath & had a look round the town of Poperinghe which is a fine big place. On the morning of the 20th I was detailed off as advance guard for platoon & left camp at 12.30 pm & marched to reserve trenches which are fitted with electric lights, through Ypres & arrived at trench at 4.30 pm which is on the banks of the Yser Canal & it is a very pretty spot. At night I had to go back towards Ypres to Wood-Cote Farm to meet the platoon & guided them to the dug outs & releived Seventh Battalion. On the way to our destination our path led past the King of Belgium’s summer palace & through the grounds of same. Next day I was put in charge of eight men & was second shift on a mining fatigue & worked six hours on & twelve off but it only last for two days, then on the night of the 28th I was on a carrying fatigue for the No. 1 Canadian Tunneling Company. During the morning of the 29th I went with four other N.C.O’s to have a look round firing line & our front consists of several craters & we hold all of them & it was Fritz who blew them up. The reserve dug outs are in big tunnels


[Page 8]
September & October 1916

dug right through the canal bank & are safe from shell fire. The canal has been bricked along both sides & iron flood gates are still undamaged. On the night of the 30th the Seventh Battalion raiders raided the German front line & succeeded in getting a few prisoners & had very few casualties. The raid took place after a fairly heavy bombardment by our artillery & trench mortars. Next day November  October the 1st, we had to put our watches back one hour & was also on day fatigue revetting a communication trench called Lovers Lane. The morning of the 4th broke with a heavy fog which lift about nine a.m. & when it lifted rain began to fall which became heavier as the day grew older. Fritz also started to throw some big & small shells about & I was with a party on fatigue in support trench & all parties were ordered back to reserves & our artillery & trench mortars opened out with a heavy bombardment which lasted about half an hour. We resumed work at mid-day & from then on Fritz bombarded & it grew worse as the day wore on & it reached its highest about six p.m. & it was pretty fierce but quitened down about eight o’clock & very little damage had been done & our artillery finished the arguement by giving Fritz a very heavy bombardment about eleven o’clock at night & it lasted over half an hour. On the night of the 7th "A" Coy releived "A" Coy of the First Battalion in the firing line & No. 4 Platoon was put in supports in dugouts on top of


[Page 9]
October 1916

the canal bank & same night I was told off as company orderly corporal. The next day the eight the coy. suffered its first casualty since coming in on the 25 of Sept. & was a wounded case "A" Coy part of the front line consisted of sentry groups on the further lip of the craters & this part of the line is called the Bluff. On the night of the 12th our Battalion raiders payed a visit to Fritz trenches inflicting a number of casualties on him & and only four on our side & the raid on a whole was fairly successful. We were releived by the 14th Battalion on the night of the 13th & I had to guide our releiving platoon to our position & then guide our platoon to Ypres where we entrained & on disentraining our band met us which was kept out of the line & played us to our camp at Dominion lines which we reached about 11pm & turned in. We were up early next morning & started on the march passing through several villiages & through the outskirts of Cassel & finally reached our billet at Godewaersvelde in the afternoon & rested. That night accompanied with a cobber we had a look round the town which is a fairly decent little place & had tea there & returned early. Next morning 10th we were on the march again & went as far as Arneke & billeted for the night & this place is nicely situated & the people are of a good class. Next morning we started off again & after a long march reached Estmont where we were


[Page 10]
October 1916

billeted in a big Chataeu which is surrounded by fine hunting grounds & a lake inside the grounds & we remain there for a few days on battalion drill. On the 19th I had to go with platoon bomb section to the Divisional Bomb School (on 19th had polling for Conscription) a distance of about three miles & threw one bomb each & returned to billet. Our next move to path  place the following night when the battalion left the chataue & marched to St. Omer & entrained. The train moved off during the early morn of the 21st & we passed through Etaples the main reinforcement training camp for Australians & also through the seaport towns of Boulougne & Calais & it was the first sight of the English chanel since coming to France in March last. We disentrained at Longpre & marched a couple of miles to the village of L’Etoile where we billeted & remained for a couple of days. On the morning of the 23rd we moved off & after marching about two miles we were put into French motors waggons at Mouflers. Our route lay through the outskirts of Amiens one of France’s biggest cities & we got out of the buses south of Albert & marched through mud & captured ground & rested for the night in canvas huts at


[Page 11]
October & November 1916

Friecourt. Next morning we were on the move again & went as far as the hill to the right of Marmetz Wood were we stayed in canvas huts for a couple of days & while there met a lot of boys from the old town & district. While there we had our packs & felt hats taken from us & was issued with extra ammunition & two bombs & two sandbags each. When we moved off on the 29th we were ready equiped for the firing line but only went to a trench between Delville & Irones Woods & there were no dug outs & had to set to & make ourselves shelter. The following following night it rained & came through our roof & we passed a miserable night but next morning set too & made our dug out rain proof & dried it. While here I saw a 15in Howitzer in action which fired a shell 4 ft 6 ins long 14 cwt & cost £450 & it was a great sight to see. On the afternoon of the 1st of November we moved to a reserve trench a little to the west of the village of Flers & two companies went into the firing line & support trench. Next day the 2nd accompied with a couple of N.C.Os I went to supports to have a look round & while on the way saw several of our famous tanks which had been put out of action


[Page 12]
November 1916

On reaching support trench found it situated on the western Eastern side of a sunken road & from here could be seen a couple of small villages a little advance of our front line & away in the distant about two miles could be seen a chimney stack & steeple belonging to the town of Bapaume. Next day our company releived "B" Coy in supports & one platoon went into firing line & it was while in these position we stood some fairly heavy artillery fire from the enemy. The next morning the 4th we lost our Colonel, he was shot by a sniper & afterwards died & it came a great blow to the battalion for he was a good soldier & a great leader & was shot while in execution of his duty. During the same night the First & Third Battalion set out to take a line of trenches. The First were knocked back but Third gained objective & early next morning a number of "A" company self included had to set out & dig in a little advance to line taken & after get well down had to evacuate at d  just before day break for owing to the First Battalion not coming up on our left Fritz occupied his old line which we took & he was then on three sides of us. It was hard luck but these unforeseen occurrences will happen.


[Page 13]
November 1916

It was fairly late that morning when we got back to our support line & we were all tired & fatigued & had a well earned rest. It was while in this line that we witnessed one of our aeroplanes set on fire by two Alien planes & although desasterous was a great sight. During the afternoon of the 5th & also the night our own heavy artillery were too short in range & our platoon which held the front line suffered severly by it. That night our platoon had to go on fatigue to the front line to clear out the trench which had been filled in by artillery & on finishing had to remain in line till stand to next morning.

During the morning of the 6th we got the order to pack up & were releived by "B" Coy & we went back to reserves where we passed the night. Next morning I had to go & look at the dug outs etc in second reserves & later in the morning were releived by the 11th Battalion & we moved back to second reserves where we stayed for several days. Throughout our stay in the trenches our rations were brought up by pack horses & also the small artillery ammunition was carried the same way. Another great thing is that our railway goes within four miles of the front line & keeps a lot of traffic off the roads. During our stay in second reserve trench air duels


[Page 14]
November & December 1916

were very frequent & also saw one of our scout planes bring down a fritz in flames. In the afternoon of the 13th we were releived by the 49th Battalion & we moved back to Berenacourt. That night we slept cramped up under tarpaulins & next moved moved back to Fricourt & same night held a concert by a big camp fire. Next morning the 15th we marched back to Buire to billets & it was quite a change to be away from the muck again. Next morning we got our packs & was able to have a good wash & shave & also went to a vaudeville show at night. On the 17th we left Buire by motors & passed through Amiens & alighted at Flessells where we billeted.

Next morning we awoke to find that we had had about 2 inches of snow & it was the first of the season. While in billets here we went through parade ground drill & on one afternoon "A" Coy played "D" Coy football & "A" coy won by 33 to nil. On the 20th we left Flessells by motors & went to Buire where we alighted & after marching about two miles found that there was no accommodations & had to return to Buire & lived in tents. During our first weeks stay at Buire we had an early reveille & had to march to Dernancourt where we worked in a saw mill & also repairing billets & also in a stone quarie. The next week we were on a


[Page 15]
December 1916

draining job near the camp. Whilst in this camp "A" Coy played "C" Coy football & "A" won by 8 points to 6. Our Major also return to the battalion & was made Lt. Colonel a few days later. On the 15th Dec we had to pack up & march to Meualte & and went into huts & was on fatigue loading & unloading trains. Our stay here however was short for on the 20th we again packed up & marched to huts in Melbourne camp Marmetz & stayed for the night. Next morning we moved off to Bernafay & again stayed overnight in huts. It was during the afternoon of the 22nd when we left Bernafay & my company went right into the firing line which consisted of outposts & I was put in charge of No 9 night post & had three men with me. It was a rather cold job for we went on post at dusk & stayed till dawn & was exposed to all weather & was a case of marking time the whole time to keep warm but we got a small rest of a day. All night long on the 23rd Fritz shelled the post & during the early hours of the next morning he made it that hot that I had to move the post. Our relief came on the night of the 24th when "D" Coy relieved us & we went back to supports. Supports were situated at Battalion H. Quarters & we were in a big tunnel but there was only sitting room. Our duties here we too carry rations


[Page 16]
December 1916

to the front line of a night which was rather an unpleasant job going through mud knee deep but still it had to be done. It was in supports that we spent our Xmas day on on the 27th at dusk we had to move up to the front line again & releive "D" Copy & I took charge of the same post & spent a very cold night for the frost set in before midnight. At dawn next morning we move to our dug out in the village of Goudicourt for a few hours rest & after being asleep was awakened at 11 am by the Sergeant Major & I was told to pack up all my gear & report to Company Headquarters. On reporting I was told I was being sent to an Instructional School for a month & of course did not mind in the least for it was a pleasure to get away from the mud & slush for a while. After leaving Coy. H.Qts I was accompanied by my platoon Officer & another Corporal & we had to report to Battalion Headquarters. Our next move was about 2 pm. when we left Battn HQts & at dusk reached our transport at Montouban & had a good meal & also had a well needed rest that night. Next morning the 29th we left the transport & made for Albert & after walking about a mile we caught a motor which took us to Albert where we stayed for a couple of days. During our stay here we received our packs & had a good bath & a change of col clothes & felt quite new after being in the mud for so long. Our next move was on Sunday the 31st of December & by


[Page 17]
January 1917

this time we had picked up with officers & N.C.Os from every battalion in the Division & we line up & marched about half a mile & got into motor buses. We were in the buses for a few hours & we passed through Amiens & got out at La Chaussie & then had to march a kilometer to Tirancourt were the school is situated in a big chateau on the northern bank of the Somme River. When we reached the school we were checked off & shown to our quarters & next morning when we fell in we were told off in Syndicates & commenced our training. At night we were able to visit Piqu  Picquigny a decent village nearby. On Sunday leave was granted to Amiens & we went by train the fare being 21/2d & spent some decent time in the city.

Our stay last four weeks at the school & during that time experienced some very cold weather. Snow fell & a big freeze set in & we were able to skate on the small ponds on the bank of the river. On Saturday evening the 27th of Jan. we left the school by motors & after a few hours rough ride alighted at the Anzac reinforcement camp Albert where we stayed the night. We never go up till late next morning & it was very cold & after having a walk through the town set out for the battalion about 1 pm. We marched all the afternoon & when about a mile from the battalion our officer called a halt & we spent the night in the 49th Battalion camp. The major of this camp was very good to us for


[Page 18]
January & February 1917
after fixing us up with a tent sent a dixie of tea & an issue of rum. Next morning we had breakfast & set off for the battalion. We reached Highwood East & there was a platoon from each company there on fatigue work & my platoon was there out of "A" Coy. Our stay only lasted a short while but during the stay we had to push rations & engineers gear up near the firing line on the small tramway (Last). We received orders to move late in the afternoon of the 31st & the platoon moved up to Cough Drop & our duties here were to carry miners gear from the dump to advance company Headquarters & making saps out to the outposts. On the afternoon of the 4th of February, the platoon moved back to Highwood but I had to report to Coy H Qtrs & stayed the night & next day in a big dug out near supports. That night the 5th I was given six men & went to the firing line & took over No. 23 post. It was the flank post of the company & I had to report to "C" Copy ever second hour. We had it very cold while in the line & we used to get hot stew & tea of a night & hot tea about 4 am including a rum issue at midnight. We only did twenty four hours in the line & next night we were releived & went back to supports at Coy H Qtrs for twenty four hours.


[Page 19]
February & March 1917

When our twenty four hours were up we went into the line again & were releived early next morning & went back to supports. On the 8th night of the 8th we were releived by the 1st Battalion & we moved back to No. 5 Camp Bazentin. While in this camp half the company was sent on fatigue work to Clarke’s Dump for a few days. We were awakened during the early hours of the 25th to stand to as it had been found that the Germans had evacuated their forward position. Everything was excitement for we had extra gear etc issued & was under a moments notice to move to the firing line. Our next move came on the eve of the 27th when we left camp & was loaded up ready for all emergencies & when about a third of the journey had been walked we had to pick up tins of water. We had a long march & passed over the evacuated ground & through the village of Le Barque & into a big chalk pit where we rested for a while. After a short spell we moved out & started to dig a support line & dug on ground with grass on & very few shell holes. After digging for about an hour we again moved forward through the village of Thilloy & releived the Eleventh Battn. & dug in which had to be done with an entrenching tool. Our chief duties in this position was to keep quiet of a day & patrol work


[Page 20] 
February & March 1917

& strengthening our position of a night. Our stay only last 52 hours there & we were not troubled much although he tried to find our position with artillery, trench mortars & machine guns but we only had four casualties in the company. It was well into the night of the 1st of March when we were releived by the 5th battalion & then moved back to dug outs in the maize. We stayed six days there & during that period I was able to have a good look over the ground which fritz first evacuated & it was no wonder he did so for his 1st 2nd & 3rd lines where simply torn to pieces by our artillery & his dead were very thick everywhere & he had mines set everywhere too but luck favoured us & all of these were unloaded without suffering any Casualties. We were relieved from this position on the night of the 7th by the 20th Battalion & moved back to Bazentin camp No. 2 & turn in about midnight all completely tired out for we had had a fairly strenuous time without much sleep the past eight days. We moved off next morning however but our march was not far & we went to Marmetz camp where we stayed a few days & was able to clean ourselves & felt much better. On the 16th we again moved off & went to the village of Dernancourt & it was my first visit to a village since the end of January & we were able to buy plenty of food & lived high during our stay there. On the 21st we marched to billets at Ribemont & on the 25th played the Brigade Trench Morter


[Page 21]
March 1917 April

Battery football & won by 13 points to nil. After about ten days hard training we had to pack up & moved again towards the line & marched about twelve miles & stayed at Montouban for the night. Our next move came next morning & went as far as Fremicourt & throughout the whole of the march it snowed very heavy and we were wet through when we reached our destination but we soon had a big fire going & dried ourselves. During the afternoon of the next day the 5th we again moved off & releived the 53rd Battn. in the firing line & I took charge of a post situated on a big railway bank the far side of Velu but I only had charge of this post for a few hours for I was releived by another platoon

36
& at dusk I had to make another post further out. During this time the Coy had sent out patrols & found that the enemy had evacuated for some hundreds of yards so before daylight our platoon advanced about 3,000 yds and dug in, in a big bank. As soon as we reached the bank I was again sent forward about two hundred yards & with four men & had to dig an outpost & came in at daylight then had to dig ourselves a "posy" & then had a good rest. Next night two more platoons came forward & dug in in supports to us. On the night of the 7th one platoon again went forward about three hundred yards & dug in in a sunken road


[Page 22]
April March  1917

& the same night our platoon set out to take an enemy machine gun post but found when they reached their objective the enemy had evacuated it. Our next move was on the night of the eighth when we went forward to the platoon ahead of us as we were to act as supports to half the battn who were advancing early next morning. When the hour came for the hop out "C" & "D" Coy went forward with the 2nd battalion on their left & took their objective with few casualties but under heavy machine gun fire. The second battn. took the village of Hermies with our half battn supporting on the left. In the stunt there were about 250 prisoners & 7 machine guns taken thru by our battns. After things had settled down our platoon went forward & dug in another sunken road in support to "D" Coy & after digging ourselves in we had & scour round rating fritz’s dug outs & had a good supply of rations from them. Our next move was on the night of the 10th when we releived the 2nd Battn & I was put in charge of a post of  in the railway bank a few hundred yards advanced of Hermies & during our stay here it rained & snowed the whole time. On the night of the 13th the Company went forward again & our platoon had to dig in on both sides of a road so as


[Page 23]
April 1917
to command it in the event of an attack. After digging down about three feet it was found that the enemy were working round our flank as the Company on our right had not advanced sufficient to connect up with our flank so we had to fall back about two hundred & fifty yards where we again dug in & was well down by daylight. That day the Alien air craft were fairly busy & hung over our new positions a great deal. The same morning we were told that we would be releived that night so at dusk we had our gear all ready packed to go out but the Sergeant Major came & told us we were to go forward again.

At dusk we all got pick & shovels & went forward & took up the same positions that we evacuated the night previous & dug in again. Early next morning just before daylight the enemy opened up with a heavy artillery bombardment & we all stood to & later on the same day we heard that he had counter attacked along the whole divisional front & go a good footing in one place only & was driven off again with very heavy losses. Our battalion held him every where & never gave way an inch & the attacked never reached my platoon front. Things went on uneventful for a couple more days & it was late in the night of the 16th when we were releived by the 2nd battalion & after walking till the


[Page 24]
April 1917
early hours of the next morning reached our billet at Beaumetz when we had a warm up by a fire & a rest & a good breakfast. The same afternoon we received orders to leave the village on account of the eme enemies shelling & we had to go to a sunken road & make ourselves dug outs in the banks of same which we did with satisfaction & made ourselves comfortable. On the night of the 20th three platoons were sent on fatigue & on reaching our destination it was found that there were only enough tools for two platoons so No. 4 were sent back to the dug outs & next morning I was put in charge of Brigade Guard & the same afternoon the Company moved up into support’s in a sunken road on the left of the village of Dernicourt. The next day the 22nd I finished my guard & at dusk set out to rejoin my Coy. which I did after an hour’s walk. All we had to do in this position was to carry rations to the front line of a night & throughout the couple of days we were there things were very quiet the monotony being broken by aerial combats resulting in planes being brought down on both sides. It was during the early hours of the night when we were releived by the Yorks & Lanks regiment & we moved back cross country to Velu Wood where we bivouac for the night. Near where we stayed


[Page 25]
April & May 1917
was the ruins of a big French Chateau which had been destroyed by the huns. Next morning we moved further back to Reincourt Camp which is situated midway between the villages of Reincourt & Beaulencourt. Our stay did not last very long for the following night 26th we marched to a sunken road outside Veaux to releive the 18th Battalion who were to practice a stunt & the same battalion releived us early next morning & we moved back to Reincourt Camp again. We stayed a couple of days here this time but on the 29th we again moved back to Veaux & releived the 18th Battalion & this time I was put in charge of an out post & it was about 4,000 yards behind the line. From this post we could see the artillery limbers & battalion transports taking ammunition & rations forward under observation of the enemy who used to shell them very heavy. Our next move came during the afternoon of May 2nd when we were releived by the Battalion & when we moved back to Company H Qtrs. I was detailed to report back at Reincourt Camp. The same night the 2nd Division were having a big stunt & our battalion was to move into close supports for same.


[Page 26]
5th Marched into Bapaume to have a look at the town which is now one big heap of debris. At midday of the [indecipherable] I was told to pack my gear & get ready for England so when I was ready I moved off accompanied by five other NCOs of the battalion. We went as far as Divisional Headquarters where we received a pay & was inspected by the General & was then put in huts at Bancourt in rear of Div. HQts for the night. Next morning 8th we left Bancourt & went via motors to 1st Anzac reinforcement camp & stayed the night. At night had a look round town & went to picture show. Next morning we packed up & proceeded to the railway station & after waiting a few hours left by train about three o’clock. The train arrived at Amien about four where we disentrained & went for a walk through the city & left Amiens about 6.15 by passenger train. The journey was a very pretty one for the fields & hedges are now beginning to look green & after five hours ride got out at Boulougne where we lined up & was marched to billets. We had a good bed & therefore had a good comfortable sleep & a couple of good meals. We moved off about 10 pm next morning & went to the wharf where we stayed for about two hours & then got on the "Victoria" & once on board did not have long to wait & we soon steamed out accompanied by six other boat & escort & it only


[Page 27]
took an hour & twenty five minutes to cross the channel. We pulled in at Folkstone & got straight on to the train which was waiting & travelled first class & after two & half hours run go out at Victoria Station. On alighting we were lined up in fours & marched to Headquarters at Horseferry Road where we were given twenty four hours leave & a pay.

At night I went to the theatre & had a good look around & stayed At the War Chest Club. Next day the 10th at two o’clock we left by train from Waterloo Station & alighted at Amesbury after changing a couple of times. When I alighted I took motor to Camp at Durrington & reported & was told off to our respective huts.

After a couple of days spell we had to settle down to parade ground work. On Sunday the 13th received leave & went into Salisbury by motor bus from Amesbury. It is a fine little town & has a beautiful big Cathedral surrounded by big well kept lawns & the Spire is a fine piece of workmanship & is well up in the air. The numerous little canals & parks & fine buildings & business places make the place very picturesque. On Monday morning I was told off with one man as escort for a court martial case & at dinner time I was given orders to proceed to Birkenhead as escort to bring prisoner back. I left camp at 2.30 pm & walked to Amesbury


[Page 28]
Railway Station where I caught the train but had to change at Salisbury & wait an hour or so during our wait we went & had tea & a look round the town. We managed to catch a fast train for London & alighted at Waterloo Station & then took tube for Leister Square where we had a look round & then proceed to Paddington by tube where I stayed for the night. Next morning I caught a fast train from Paddington Station at 10.30 & proceed to Birkenhead. Our journey lay through beautiful country & big towns & also through Wales & right through was a very fine trip. On arriving at our destination I reported to Civil Police & then went for a stroll. I soon learned that the H.M.A.S. Melbourne was in docks so I went & met a cobber who showed me all over her deck but although it was very interesting everything was disturbed as she is undergoing improvements etc. I left Birkenhead same night by 10.30 train with prisoner & escort but we were only in the train an hour when we had to get out at Chester & change trains. We did not have long to wait & then we had a little over an hours ride & then had to change at Crewe & wait some time. It was well into the early hours in the morning when we got a train which carried us


[Page 29]
right through to Euston Station after a lot of stopping. On reaching Euston we took tube for Charing Cross where we change into another tube for Waterloo Station where we arrived at 6 A.M. We then had 25 minutes to wait & then the train moved out & had to change at Salisbury & took train for Amesbury & arrived back at camp at midday. On Friday evening went for a walk through village of Durrington which is very old but is very pretty. Later I was sent to Officer school at Candahar Barracks Tidworth which is only a small township but with beautiful scenery & the barracks are supposed to be the most comfortable in the world.

On 13/8/17 written examination which I passed with a 63%. The school finished on Friday 17th & the same night I took train from Tidworth to Bournemouth via Andover & Salisbury. Bournemouth is a beautiful sea resort & I spent a very pleasant time there leaving on Monday night by 6 pm train & arrived back to camp at 10.30 pm. Next day I had to carry on again with parade ground work & am still going strong on the close of my second years service with A.I.F.

Albert has been fine place but owing to being under enemy shell fire so long it has been knocked about considerably but not beyond repair. It has a fine railway service & the most noticeable thing at present is the catheral spire with its overhanging monument which lies at a degrees of 120 & leans right out across the main road. There are at present a few civilians but it is used a lot by the military.

Amiens is one of France’s main cities & is situated on the banks of the Somme river. It has some fine buildings with its cathedral which is a credit & it also has a fine railway station & numerous other beautiful building & also a good tram service throughout the city. It is a thickly populated place & its visited by both French & British soldiers on leave.

5.5.17
Bapaume has been a fine big place but like all other French towns & villages its buildings are jammed up close together. Now it is one big heap of debris owing to the willful distruction of the huns before their evacuation. Since the British military authorities have occupied it they have had it cleaned up the & all the roads & thoroughfares repaired & put into good working order.

Big Town discreptions

Doulens is a fine big place & has some fine buildings including church, post office & rows of big business places & the town itself is clean & the people generally speak good English & although it is shelled by the enemies big guns has a fair population.

France [in margin]

Ypres There is very little to be seen now except ruins but the cathedral known as Cloth Hall & the Asylum & City Gates known as "Lille Gates" are the only big places that can be made out. There is also a big bell which is kept at Lille Gates & well guarded & it is the most costly bell in the world. The story goes that a collection was called for throughout Belgium & there was that much copper & silver collected that it was all melted down & made into the bell & it could be heard for twenty odd miles & was in the tower of the Cathedral before the war.

Belgium [in margin]

Poperinghe Along both sides of the main street of the town are fine big business places & in the centre of the town is a big square. The old church is still to be seen but has been hit several times by Alien shells but no great damage has been done to it. It is well populated & the people can speak very good English & it is visited by hundreds of troops on leave.

Aeroplane Contact Signalling

The 34th Flying Squadron is attached to the Anzac Army Corps & consists of 4 Contact planes which are marked with 2 black strokes on both bottom wings front to rear & also two blue streamers from the uprights under top wings. The machines are of B.E.2. type & there are not many of them.

When the observer wants to know where our front line is situated he drops a red flare from plane & is answered by the infantry by lighting a flare on the bottom of the trench in the centre & when the observer sees the flare in front line he will answer by a blast on horn.

When observer wants signallers ground sheet he will drop white flare & go through same progress as above.

N – Ammunition wanted
O – Barage wanted
H – Lengthen Range
Y – Grenades wanted
X - Held up by M.Gun fire
Z – Held up by Entanglements

The mark on the contact plane has been altered to a black oblong board on the bottom wing & projects.
