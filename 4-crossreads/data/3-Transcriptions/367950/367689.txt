<p>night. They would soon be challenged. All of us (Australians) are very indignant about these spy episodes and we refer to the "Tommy" and the "Tommy" Officer in particular with contempt well &ndash; when they are such fools<br/>and blockheads as not to question questionable people prowling around their outposts at night they deserve it all. These messages are continually coming through on the phone and they always come from the "Tommy" lines about suspected spies In some cases giving most accurate descriptions and I repeat that these gentlemen never prowl around the Australian outpost line. All training and Signalling practice automatically ceases now and we are doing the actual work. I have been working this morning by heliograph at about 7 mile range with one of our outposts. There is nothing to report about the movements of "Jacko" so far although he is not far off. Corporal Cameron went into Bir El Mazar station this morning and brought out all our spare Signalling Equipment we have that in abundance but men is the trouble we cannot afford to lose a single one of them now.  Mercer who was transferred to the Camel Corps at Cairo came back yesterday.</p>
