  
 Saturday 6th May (continued) unpopular. He comes from Neutral Bay,  [indecipherable]  plenty of bounce etc. I knew him at School, it is far better not to mention any names. 
 Sunday 7th May. 
 Same routine WORK all day. Heat is most oppressive & the glare of the sand is also very severe. Hard at it late at night. Everybody work out, a number of our men sick & I don't wonder at it. 
 Monday 8th May to Saturday 13th May. Plenty of work all the week completing the Hospital which we handed over to another Ambulance on the 13th inst. Ambulance march off at 10 a.m. for another camp at Ferry Post. A distance of 6 miles, very hot marching & the flies - enough said. 
 Sunday 14th May. Plenty of work arranging our new camp. Another section formed 3/4 Section containing 60 reinforcements the majority new arrivals in Egypt. Now have 10 officers in the Unit. The Officer in charge of A Section was on Gallipoli for many months. As the heat is so intense the orders for each day now are - Revielle 4 a.m., breakfast 4.30 a.m., first parade 5:15 a.m.- 8.30 a.m. The 2nd parade takes place at 5 p.m. Any one on reading these hours of parades can guess that the heat must be very oppressive. I can assure you that such was the case. During the day lately the temperature has been varying from 115 - 125 in the shade. On our 1st Parade this morning the Unit was inspected by our Section Officer & the Colonel, & any man who is not property dressed & with all his accoutrements cleaned is punished generally by pack drill at night.
