<p>2nd Nov:-<br/>Reveille 5-30 am, awoke to find the weather very cold. On parade at 6 am    &amp;  after Roll-call we were marched &amp; drilled around the desert for two solid hours without breakfast. Talk about hard work. This is the limit, after breakfast we have to shave &amp; clean boots &amp;  leggings for 9-30 am parade. Inspection follows and is very rigid  Full dress &amp; even buttons must be done up. After parade we had a lecture in shed until 11 am &amp;  were then paid. I have leave from 3 pm to 10 pm to go into Cairo. Caught 3.30 pm train from Hellmick Station &amp;  as usual was rushed by boot boys on arrival at Cairo. As I intended going out to the General Hospital to see friends I had my boots &amp; leggings cleaned  The boy took great pains in shining for about 15 minutes &amp; such a shine</p>
