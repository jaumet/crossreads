into the country. A characteristic of southern England is the multitude of hedges. Of course being winter the trees are bare of leaf but the country is very beautiful and no wonder the Englishman so well loves his land. Snug little farmhouses, trim hedges and the most beautiful green neat meadows. Returning to hotel called in at the Post Office and noticed the whole staff with one exception is feminine ? some good lookers too. In the streets W.A.A.C's wearing issue greatcoats. ? what will these girls do after the War. It is to be hoped all this taking on of men's work wont make them coarse. At the hotel dined in solitary state ? there does not appear to be anyone lese staying here. The people all seem well clothed and comfortable in appearance round here and the girls are good looking and neat. Needless to say there are a few gallant Anzacs about.
