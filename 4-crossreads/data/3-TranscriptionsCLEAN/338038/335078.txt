Mena CampEgypt. 22nd March 1915
My dear Father & Mother.I have just received your cable, which I have rather had to transcribe for myself as it seems to have been mutilated somewhat. It read as follows:-"Fed, his children, kenzie. leaving fifth June Osterley, address Pittar, dentist. Exter, Devonshire letters explaining, all well, love."It is of course quite a surprise to me, but I expect the letters will come along in due course. Heaven only knows where I will be by the time they reach this side of the Globe, but I will of course keep the movements of the "Osterley" in view, and try & pick the travellers up somewhere.I also have your letters of the 15th February, for which many thanks.
