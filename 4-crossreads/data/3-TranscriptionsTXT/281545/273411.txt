 on July 31st Fritz retreated &amp; it was not necessary to blow up the Tunnel.   To go down the Tunnel you have to walk down two flights of stairs to about 40 ft &amp; then along a few yards when you come to opening which is the Engine Room where the Electric Light is generated.    The Engine is work by boys from an Australian Technical corp, who live underground as you walk along you pass recesses which are used for several purposes, one recess is the boys quarters having several bunks built along the sides another is their Cookhouse &amp; so on, further on these recesses are us as AMC Dressing stations &amp; Officers quarters, it is very wet &amp; damp &amp; the water runs along both sides of the floor boards, even where the boys live it is always wet underfoot &amp; they always wear their Gum Boots.   I don't intend going down again as I caught a chill &amp; was laid up for a few days.   The Atmosphere is to damp for my liking.   I only stayed down there for about an hour then I came up &amp; after a while the Troops arrived &amp; off we went as far as Regersberg when I left the Train &amp; stabled my Engine for the night.   One can walk along the Tunnel for about 1 mile ahead &amp; a good distance along branches on each sides.
