 E. comes home & Dick packs up for going away. I learn of New W.O.'s but I am not eligible. We talk about Trade & other things. I do not send Photo away. I do some codging. We find a Batman. We are both up to see J.M.Y.'s. 
 7 March, Friday 
 W. I write several letters to M & Tweam en[d] up eventually get one away & go to [indecipherable] for dance & get scaled them go to Y.W.C.A. until 10.45. Ellis thinks I have gone astray when I don't come home. We are all dopey & sick & I am very very much longing for Isle of Man & can't sleep. 
 Dick Top goes away.
