<p>Esdud. Nov 12th.<br/>22 <strike>15-30</strike> miles up the coast from Gaza</p>
<p>We have caught up with the Brigade &amp; are now camped just behind a village. There is a battery firing just a few hundred yards in front of us &amp; a half battery of heavies firing a few hundred yards behind us so I expect we shall get shelled out of here soon.</p>
<p>The Turks have made a stand here &amp; held us up for two days &amp; now the 52nd Inf Division is up here attacking them. There is an enormous amount of material &amp; guns abandoned back on the road &amp; there must be at least &amp;pound;3000000</p>
