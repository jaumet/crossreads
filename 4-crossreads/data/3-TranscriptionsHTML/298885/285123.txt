<p>Jan 29th &ndash; 17<br/>For the last four days we have done overtime in the walking line. We have had to walk from our Chateau in Albert to the lay lines for the different batteries to be ready, when they come into action and of course this necessitated a return journey home each day per boot. This meant a distance of 16 miles a day besides the extra walking between the battery positions over snow and frozen undulated ground which made our legs rather weary, likewise</p>
