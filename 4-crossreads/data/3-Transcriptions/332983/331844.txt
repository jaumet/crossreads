They are to be tried tomorrow 22inst<br/>22/11/1915<br/>A terrific attack and bombardment by the enemy last night, beginning at 5 oclock. They must have sent over 2,000 shells, it lasted all night. The Eskie lines of trenches are as level as a billiard table, all the parapets blown down. Terrible slaughter amongst our men, legs and arms strewn about all over the place. We held our own. The Turks charged, they were driven back with fearful losses, we gained 3 more trenches. It was  a terrible night. Bitterly cold, wind blowing a gale, and light rain. Even now at 4.20 P.M. the Artillery are blazing away. This is the fiercest fighting since June the 4th. All this happened on our left flank, our weakest point. It was held by the Scottish Regiments<br/>23/11/1915<br/>Bitterly cold again. Terrific shooting last night. A fair amount of Artillery fire today.<br/>Peninsula press No 88. 15/11/1915</p>
