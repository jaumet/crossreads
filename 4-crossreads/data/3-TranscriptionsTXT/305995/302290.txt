 returned to a position known as Hod-el-Khirba, where a supply depot, left by the enemy during his hasty retreat, was commandeered by the boys. The stores therein were very useful as there were hundreds of bushels of barley, meal &amp; rice, besides their iron rations &amp; preserved olives &amp; dates, which we hungry troops soon "hit to leg", &amp; gave our horses a fine feed of barley &amp; they earned it, as the poor beasts had been without water for two days &amp; nights. We camped here till August 12th in case any of the enemy may come to light, but nothing occured &amp; we pushed on to the Turks late base at Bir-el-Abd, reaching there at 3 p.m. the same day. Here we struck water melons &amp; figs, which were a luxury after bully &amp; biscuits &amp; they were not long in existence I tell you. In the wells here our Medicos found traces of cholera germs so we were extremely short of water, having had only a quart in twenty eight hours &amp; over 109 in the whisky bottle. The Turks were seen by our patrols six miles east of Bir-el-Abd making in the direction of El Arish it was decided to withdraw all troops to Romani, which camp we reached at 4 p.m. on the 13th, the following afternoon.
