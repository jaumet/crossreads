one of our Services - The Officers in full dress & the men standing at attention, the Sisters    &  Matron wear their red capes & white caps with grey dresses, it is quite a brilliant spectical. Everybody joins in so heartily in the responses & singing. The dear old Colonel is quite a fatherly old man & says the prayers very earnestly.
