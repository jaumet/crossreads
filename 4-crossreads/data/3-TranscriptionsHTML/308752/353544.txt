<p>The country being new to us, &amp; the day being a misty one, we very often took the wrong road.  One village we passed through was being shelled, &amp; you can bet that the marching soon broke into a double. In this village we passed a battalion of tommies &amp; they were the finest body of English troops that I have seen for a long while. The majority of them were close on 6 feet high.   Arrived at our destination at midday after being continually on the go since three o'clock the previous night. The unit is billeted in stables, &amp; in the grounds of a very fine chateau. The Orderly Room this time is in the dining room of the chateau &amp; is beautifully furnished.  It is possible for you to picture the scene?   Here is a body of troops nearly 300 strong, quartered in a beautifully furnished residence, the owners have gone leaving everything behind them.   There were nine bedrooms in the building all of which, contained very fine furniture, the dining, breakfast, &amp; smoke, rooms, were likewise. The owners of this place must have been well educated people as the study contained a magnificent library. Perhaps any day, this fine residence will be dashed to pieces with shells, it is really cruel to think of such a thing. Thank God that this gigantic struggle is not being fought on English or Australian soil.  On reading some of the Australian papers, which very seldom come my way, it is disheartening &amp; disgusting to see half the news being about amusements, especially race meetings &amp; boxing bouts. It makes me think if the people out there realise that there is a war on. Of course I don't believe in cutting out amusements altogether what I would really like to see is moderation. An American soldier told me not long ago that the race-course &amp; the stadium had been closed down in America for the duration of the war.</p>
