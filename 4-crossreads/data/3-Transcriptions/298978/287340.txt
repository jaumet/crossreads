<p>Mar; 28<br/>To Cairo &ndash; lunch with Garavedien &ndash; studies &ndash; visit a prison in Cairo; the Director was most hospitable, sent out for coffee and showed me the prison &ndash; most awful looking hole, though the prisoners did not seem the least worried about it.</p>

<p>Mar; 31<br/>Marched to Marg &ndash; it is a delightful country, very green &ndash; we bivouac here the night &ndash; in order to get away from the crowd I took my blankets and went about a mile from the camp</p>
