<p>6/5/18  Querrieu</p>
<p>Rain falling in warm steady showers and must be splendid growing weather.   All the fruit trees in the gardens are covered with blossom    Owing to the rain I cancelled the parades called for the morning and ordered them in the billets to carry out indoor training.    An inspection later on proved necessary and disclosed dirty billets and other irregularities.   Last night an aeroplane of ours had to make a forced landing and the two "birds" came to us for food and shelter.   One was a dear little boy not more than 18, typically English and who had only been out a few days from his Cadet School.    On my round of the billets I struck a very old couple who were refugees from Ribemont.   Poor old folk they were crouching over a stove, homeless and forelorn and broke into tears when we spoke of the War and of their homes.   The old woman was tiny and scrupulously neat and cried when she told of her two dead sons.    Where is the glory of War when you see its product in a sight like this &ndash; one of thousands!   The village looked very pretty under grey weepy skies, with green border of trees and fruit blossom and old fashioned redtiled houses, some with little turrets and dovecots.    Found a man lying sick in a billet and arranged to send the doctor down to him.</p>
