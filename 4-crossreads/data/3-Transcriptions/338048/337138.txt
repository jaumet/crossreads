<p><strike>Tuesday</strike><br/>in the Y.M. in the evening &amp; it partook of the nature of a farewell concert to us &amp; the padre who leaves tomorrow. We had a good lively time greatly enjoying ourselves.</p>
<p>Tuesday 19th<br/>Assisted in office for an hour or two in morning &amp; then wrote letters</p>
<p>Padre "marched out" on a cable wagon drawn by 12 horses the chaps lining the road. At places brooms etc were used to "present arms". He was a good sport &amp; very sorry to leave us</p>
<p>Rainy day except evening when I went for a walk.</p>
<p>Wednesday 20th<br/>Office works, application for leave to Birmingham fixed up</p>
<p>Spent evening in camp</p>
<p>Thursday 21st<br/>As three days' light duty was up I paraded sick again and was put back on duty &ndash; The chaps have for the last two or three days been doing route marches &amp; today I went out also. We marched about 1 mile past Clop Hill &amp; then returned doing about 9 miles. During an &frac12; hour spell at Clop Hill I visited the flour mill which is worked by water power in a very businesslike manner. The mill was very quiet &amp; interesting.</p>
<p>After dinner we marched another 5 or 6 miles and felt pretty tired after doing I think</p>
