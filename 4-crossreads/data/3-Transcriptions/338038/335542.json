<p>W.G. to Genl. Sir John Monash</p>
<p>Dear Sir<br/>Your reply to my letter of 22nd Inst. reached me today and it only remains for me to thank you for explaining why the engagement of 5th April /18 was called the battle of Derencourt and the connection of the village of Millencourt therewith &ndash; and for your sympathetic reference to my son.  May I tell you how deeply it is appreciated &ndash; this part of my message now to you Mrs Garling asks to be allowed to share with me.<br/>Yours Sincerely<br/>WNG</p>
