 the wind was unfavourable. We used to sit in our apartments at night, crowded round a small coal fire; some were writing letters on a pad on their knee, while others would be talking of their experiences in the trenches, and letting us new reinforcements know what we were going into in a few days.  A few days passed by and we got orders to move; to where we did not know at the time. We packed up our kits and marched to  the railway station at Albert, a distance of about  4 miles, and embarked into a train which took us to Flesselles, a place about 15 miles from Amiens.

On entering the building from the front entrance, which is a portico exhibiting some fine examples of French masonry, I came to a wide hall which led into the main hall of the Church. As soon as I entered the main hall I was amazed at the wonderfully high arches in the construction of the building, and also the massiveness of the columns which supported them. Around the main
