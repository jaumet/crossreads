<p>Dear Mrs Hill<br/>It is with the deepest regret that I write to you about the death of your Son Sgt Hill &ndash; I had not known him long but I cannot find words to tell you how sadly he is universally missed &ndash; he did his job with great courage &amp; even after being so seriously wounded insisted that his job should be carried out before he himself was attended to &ndash; he died a few days ago in the Casualty Clearing Station a few hundred yards from here and is buried close by with many more of his comrades &ndash; I have thought you would perhaps like to know that the Company have placed a very neat Cross over the grave which is suitably inscribed &ndash;<br/>Please accept my very deepest Sympathy in the great loss that you have</p>
