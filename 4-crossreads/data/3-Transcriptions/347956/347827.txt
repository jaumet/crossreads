<p>driver to drive us through the town till 10.15 &amp; the drive was glorious.  first through the main streets &amp; then into the narrow streets of the slums.  it was very interesting driving through these as there is not room for two vehicles to pass in places we went &amp; they are crowded with natives also Singalese, Burmese, French, Italian, Russian, Portugise &amp; Belgian women of a very low class live in these streets</p>
<p>as we went through from every few doors we passed came the sound of natives music.  the musicians looked quite funny playing their bamboo fifes &amp; other native instruments;<br/>all the traffic here is back to front, as we have to travel up the right hand side of the street instead of the left, leaving any vehicles we pass on our left side;  We arrived at the station</p>
