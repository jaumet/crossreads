<p>March 6th 1919</p>
<p>This morning I was out at twenty minutes to sunrise to get the effect of light for the charge at the "Neck".  Very cold, bleak &amp; lonely.  The Jackals, Damn them, were chorusing their hate, the bones showed up white even in the faint dawn and I felt rotten, but as soon as I got to my spot the colour of the dawn on this shrubby scrubby hilly-land was very beautiful and I did my little sketch quite well before breakfast.</p>
<p>Ten thirty saw Spruce &amp; self struggling with a water colour of a very impressive subject &ndash; impressive both in art and military tradition.</p>
<p>The worst feature of this after battle work is that the silent hills &amp; valleys sit stony, unmoved, callous of the human and busy only in growing bush, &amp; sliding earth to hide the scars</p>
