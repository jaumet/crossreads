<p>hour &amp; had a good talk to our friends: they think a lot of the Aust's: the march was through pretty country all the way: there are plenty of "dutch" windmills round these parts &amp; they look queer being generally up on a hill: Cassel looks a fine place &amp; stands out very prominent: as we marched through we had a glorious view of the surrounding country: had dinner on the road: got to our billets at Arneke about 3 pm having done about 12 miles: we got a barn with plenty of clean straw: Tom Sid &amp; I went to town after tea &amp; had a feed: this is a very up to date farm &amp; has churn separaters &amp; other modern machinery: they use the dog wheels here too:</p>
<p>Thursday Oct 19th  <br/>Arneke: cold showery day: nothing doing during the day: we nestled into the straw to keep warm: Reg Tom Alf &amp; I went in to the village after tea &amp; had a feed in honour of Mr C. who sent us the money: it is a very straggling village: the church is a nice one &amp; is over 300 years old:</p>
<p>Friday Oct 20th <br/>Arneke: cold day: frost in morning: fell in with full kit &amp; marched up the road to a paddock &amp; had a "lesson" on packing up the kit: the other Coy s were voting on the conscription problem: after dinner we played football &amp; fly &amp; then marched back to vote: I voted No which is the popular vote among us in the ranks for many reasons: why should we bring men to a life such as this when they don't know how to</p>
