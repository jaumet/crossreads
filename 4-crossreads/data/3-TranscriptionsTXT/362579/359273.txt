 My dear Mother   &amp;  Sisters, 
 I'm in London once more, - We arrived here on Friday-evening after travelling about three days   &amp;  nights. Shall be able to tell you all about our journey better when I see you but goodness known when I shall be in Aust. again. 
 It is much warmer here   &amp;  we are staying at a very comfortable hotel. Three of us got our Leave, it came through in a hurry. Sorry I did not have more time to w rite to friends   &amp;  let them know I was getting over here.
