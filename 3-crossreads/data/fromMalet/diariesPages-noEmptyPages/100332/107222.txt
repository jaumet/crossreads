The Staff at the station were all in a Culvert under the Line which also was full of Men Women children. They all stopped there until after 2 am when the Fires from the dump had died out at 2.30 am I obtained Line clear started for Arques for water after obtaining same was sent on further to Ballastare where my relief was waiting on arrival at this place another Engine came in which was from the Siding in Campain the Driver who was very much upset told me of his experiences. The first Bomb dropped struck a heap of Petrol which made the blaze gave Fritz a good view of the Dump close by, which he soon hit causing shells to explode pieces to fly all around. The Eng was hit in several places but the Crew escaped. The Chinaman in their compound scattered in all directions, some took shelter behind an Estaminet a Bomb Dropped hit the building killing them all also a lot of Tommies around about were killed wounded, also Chinaman. The boys next day reported a terrible mess of things. On my arrival at St Omer, things were only middling. The boys at the Depot had a lively experience.
