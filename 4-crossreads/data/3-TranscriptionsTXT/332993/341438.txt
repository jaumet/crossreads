and I believe that I have at last succeeded in inventing a machine that costs nothing to run, for it works in still water. I started on it long before the war, made some experiments on the steamer coming over also in England and this past few months have give a lot of study to it and have several ideas in my mind. I mentioned the matter to Mr. Hunter this morning &and; will have an interview with him this evening. I am desirous of getting time &and; facilities to experiment.There was a fleet of our aeroplanes hovering over Fritz's lines this afternoon for a considerable time. There was over a dozen planes in the fleet they flew at a greater altitude and all Fritzs shots were below them.This evening all our gas respirators were examined and a new apparatus attached to them to counteract a new gas that Fritz is using.I forgot to mention that last evening I was paid 15 Francs equal to 11/-.
Saturday May 26 1917.It is very hot to day, or rather we feel the heat very trying after the long cold winter.This morning I again sharpened and set the chaff cutter knives, and started to clean a cooker.
