 Gallipoli 2nd. December 1915 
 My dear Mother, 
 Everything in the garden is lovely. The snow is practically all gone, &amp; if it wasn't going on for midnight, the sun would be shining, &amp; I'd be as warm as toast. Luckily for me I've been back to civilisation since I first landed here &amp; was able to bring back all sort of comforts in the shape of sleeping bags etc, the only unfortunate part about it is, that when we move from one post to another, I have to get a fatigue party to move my effects. Its much too late to wish you a Merry Christmas, but at the same time I'll do it now &amp; keep on doing it till Christmas is over which will be sometime about three weeks ago, I should imagine. I hope they don't torpedo our Christmas consignment of comforts. If they do, I  fel  feel pretty confident that someone will get up &amp; give the Turks a knock. 
 Yr affectionate son Arthur
