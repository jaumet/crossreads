7/5/17  Norreuil
2.40 am Many of our shells going over. A 4.5 how battery a few yards away is most disconcerting and shaking this wretched little place dreadfully
3.30 A heavy rally of artillery which died down soon
3.45 Zero A deafening little brute opposite started to speak very loudly. Clear cold moonlight artillery ammunition teams will have a warm passage out through the village. No much noise here at 3.50.
4 am As before but away towards the left there is a loud crumping sound that means big ones going over. Owing to the almost entire absence of noise we commenced to think that the stunt had not come off. The barrage behind the embankment was very heavy and contained a large proportion of shrapnel. Walked along and saw a number of wounded Gordons going across country and one said that he had been in the charge and right into the village. Lost my fountain pen at Bde H.Q. last night and this morning at 4am sent over for it. The orderly went down into the dugout and awakened the general! A very calm fresh morning and the smoke blotted out the scene. A few flares, a few crashes and much rattling of m.gs was all that was to be seen of the battle of Bullecourt.
