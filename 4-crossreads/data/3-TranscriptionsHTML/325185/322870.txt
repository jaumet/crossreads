<p>beginning to get cold reminds one the winter is coming again. We havent had very much wet weather so far. Just showers not enough to make the ground sloppy &amp;amp: hinder the offensive but very uncomfortable while you are in the front line. Well the Americans have signed their name on the Western front &amp;amp: signed it very well also. I think Germany recognizes now she underestimated the assistence they could give in so short a time. Harry Cross is still in Blighty &amp;amp: appears to be settled there good luck to him I say. Aunt Nell sent me photos of Don &amp;amp: Rex also a snap of Gran. The last boy looks a fine little chap judging by the photo. I suppose the Giles family are growing now. I shall have a fair No of new acquantances to make when I come back.I havent been abel to get near the old Batn since receiving the address of Bert's mate. But he called at our transport asking for me But we were in the line at the time. I shall look him up the first chance I have.  I hope Bert is still keeping well. He should be about due for exchange now. It would be much better for him could he get transferred to Holland. Well must close now. Love &amp;amp: the best of wishes to all<br/>Your Sincere son.
