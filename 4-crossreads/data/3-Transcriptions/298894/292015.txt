<p>"Scoring Well"<br/>How often from the tented slopes<br/>In summer we've acclaimed<br/>The stalwart drive that topped the ropes,<br/>The wrist stroke neatly aimed!<br/>How long the bowlers trained each nerve,<br/>Before a wicket fell;<br/>While waiting wires received the news,<br/>Australia scoring well.</p>
<p>How oft in winter's day gone by,<br/>We've heard the crows acclaim,<br/>The swift low pass, the brilliant trip,<br/>The hard but sporting game.<br/>The while across the world there leapt<br/>Brief messages to tell<br/>Another triumph for all Blacks;<br/>New Zealand scoring well.</p>
<p>And now when greater games are played<br/>And greater deeds are done,<br/>Where sing the bullet &amp; the blade<br/>Beneath the Eastern Sun.<br/>More welcome to the Homeland flash<br/>The messages that tell<br/>Australians &amp; New Zealanders<br/>Continue <u>scoring well.</u></p>
