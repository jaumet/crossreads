<p><u>Pyramids</u>:-  Approached by tram from Cairo to about a mile of the first one.  As soon as you get out of the tram you are assailed by a horde of Camel and donkey men and guides, waiting to take you over the sights.  However, we thought it safer to walk.  The Pyramids and Sphinx are of course very interesting, but they turned out to be no ways different from what I imagined them to be.  We had a very good guide, only a young fellow, and he told us a fine tale, about how they were built, and who was buried under them and in the tombs etc.  Of course we weren't in a position to doubt his word, so I suppose he manufactured a bit as he went on.</p>
<p><u>As to the Camp</u>:-  It is as hot as ---- and we only drill in the early morning and the cool of the evening.  The tucker is rotten and from 11st 1, which I weighed when I first came here, I have gone down to 10.6.  There was a mail in to-day 2nd August 1915 letters posted about two days after we left.  Some of the boys got one or two and there is great excitement.  It is a great event in Camp.</p>
<p>I'll have to knock off now for lack of more news and hope you and Bill will keep a supply of letters coming this way.</p>
<p>Hope it is not as hot over your way as it is here.</p>
<p>Don't think there is any hope of action for some time yet.</p>
<p>Your affectionate brother,<br/>Pte 1280 R. Richards.</p>
