Had breakfast at Le Mans on Station here - passed many American Soldiers in trains - felt hatted & cheerful. Weather very cold now but Joe's leather waist coat keeps me warm. Changed trains & got out of Italian & French carriages. Arrived CHERBOURG - had a shave & shampoo, ordered lunch but could not remember the French for DUCK but "quack" "quack" did it. Raining & cold. We cross Channel tonight. Wet thro' as no Cabins or Restaurant on board a Lake Turbine Steamer.
