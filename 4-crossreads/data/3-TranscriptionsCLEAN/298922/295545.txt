 KHAN YUNUS Back again with the Regiment which is on the Beach. Found my Horses looking well & the men enjoying a well earned rest. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.] Poor Lieut. TIM BLACK of the 6th L.H. was killed last week & we had 1 man & 4 others wounded on RECONNAISSANCE. Nothing to worry about here for several weeks now, so we understand but one never knows one's luck. PARCELS redirected arrived safely. Please thank JACK FORTH for the Handerchiefs every one is very good. I'll write John later on.
