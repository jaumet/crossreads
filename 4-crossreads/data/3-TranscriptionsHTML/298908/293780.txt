<p>to see the Winters.  I like them very much, stopped the night there, about 3 oclock in the afternoon Eva, Vera &amp; I went down the town to see Mrs. Oliver but she was busy so we decided to call later on in the meantime they took me out to the Park, they have a lovely rose Garden &amp; a splendid hot house filled with all the delicate flowers ferns &amp; plants imaginable while strolling round Eva lost her new bangle of cameos, a pretty old &amp; valuable trinket &amp; it was the first time she had worn it.  Vera <strike>gga</strike> gagged her unmercifully but she took it all in good part.  On the way back we picked up with Mrs. Oliver.  I did not like the idea of meeting her for some unknown &amp; foolish reason she was annoyed with me for not seeing or writing to her before &amp; the best of it was that I had even gone out to Eltham to see her &amp; she was out &amp; I had written her several times, but apparently she had never received them, at any rate I did not care much for it was</p>
