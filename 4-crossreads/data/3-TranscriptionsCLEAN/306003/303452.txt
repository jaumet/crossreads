  
 31-7-16 infantry had 5 men killed & 14 wounded in consequence;  The only casualty from rifle fire today was a 2nd L. Horseman slightly wounded.  We received orders this evening to be ready to move off at 7 oclock & as we only had 3 or 4 miles to go we should have arrived in camp early, but the main body lost sight of the advance guard & got lost, & it was 12.30 after midnight before we got into camp.  there a good stew was waiting us & we were soon asleep; This morning a Turk was captured & brought in, when the guard got him to the water trough to water his horse a couple of Indians came down & wanted to cut the Turks throat, they scared the Turk but of course the guard would not consider the proposal
