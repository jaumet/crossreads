Monday 28th   Had busy day as I was chasing round various camps pinching & begging odds and ends.  The 3rd LH Bde left to-day for Serapim and I received nearly all their tables chairs and surplus drugs of the 10th LH.  I fixed everything up nice and comfortable and by night time I had the hospital tent looking like a chemists shop.  Wrote two letters home and received three more.
Tuesday 29th  Last day of Leap Year.  What a time the girls in Australia must be having.  I spent the whole day dispensing  medicines.  I made up four gallons of cough mixture Pot Chlor, Astringents, Soda Salays etc.  I made enough to last me for a month.  Dr prescribed and I dispensed.  It was a busy day for me as I am unaided and doing four men's work I was going from 6 am to 8 pm.
Wednesday 1st March  Hot day miserably so, after a busy day decided to run into O'Rs to get away from the desert heat.  Rec three more letters from home.  Sullie went back to Mena to-day.
Thursday 2nd March  One of those cursed dusty days  It blew all day all my drugs & dressings were coated inches deep with thick dust.  To-day was the anniversary of the formation of the 12th Reg and the men had a half holiday whilst the officers had a spread, it will soon be my second anniversary.
Friday 3rd March   Five AMC men were sent over to-day by mistake so I took one and the others were sent back. I want to keep the place open for my young brother.
Saturday 4th Mar.  In a m over at drug store I met an old schoolmate there and consequently did very well as I obtained more than my req.  In pm went to Races at Ghezireh had a miserable day, poor meeting small fields, backed three winners and yet lost 300 PT.  Then went to O'Rs where a letter was waiting from my brother Harold no address heavily censored apparently his other letters to me have been destroyed.
Sunday 5th Mar.  Small sick parade spent pm writing letters.  Dispensed five bottles of drugs.
