<p>Monday February 26. 1917<br/>A cloudy but fine day.  It is now much drier underfoot.  There was a chapter of accidents this morning commencing before most of us were out of bed.  Leonard Sheean was trying to get Valentine a company driver to get out of bed.  This Valentine disliked and he swung a heavy boot round his head, not with any intention of hurting, but unfortunately it struck sheean over the eye, and he droped like a stone striking his mouth on a board and knocking a piece off a tooth.  He was dazed and could not speak  He was helped up and his wounds dressed</p>
