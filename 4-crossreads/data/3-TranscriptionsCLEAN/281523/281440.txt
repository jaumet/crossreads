16/8/17 Campagne  Stayed in during the morning and attended to routine work and went out to the parade ground at lunch time.  The Battalion was route marching and arrived there rather blown.  During the afternoon carried out some company tactical exercises forming defensive flanks, advance guard and some trench to trench operations.  A fine afternoon and the view was very fine from the parade ground. The harvest is well under weigh and the landscape for miles round is dotted with stooks of corn all gathered in.  The scenery is very nice in every direction.  Marched home with the band playing but our marching was not too good.  After mess called in the company commanders and discussed things with them in general.  Spent the evening in my room but constantly interrupted by office work and things calling for decision or opinion.  Payday yesterday and as a consequence a certain amount of people merry.
