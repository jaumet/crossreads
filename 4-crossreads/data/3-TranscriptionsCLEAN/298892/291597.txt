My Dear Parents/.I received an interesting letter from Mother yesterday dated the 8th. August - just two months which I think is about the usual time the mail takes. It seems strange to hear that you are still, or rather were still, speculating as to whether I am in England or still on the way.  I hope you are receiving my letters alright. We are constantly receiving fresh orders as to where and how our letters are to be posted so that they may be censored properly. I started numbering them but I have forgotten what the last number was: anyhow I have been writing every week since our arrival here and that is now fourteen weeks ago.
I cabled home yesterday for ten pounds out of my account. I would have managed without this but for the fact that we are being given four days indulgence leave this or next week and it will be in all probability our last leave in England. Before we are allowed go on this holiday we must be able to produce at least four pounds. Needless to say on two shillings a day I haven't succeeded in saving this amount or even a portion of it and I think it would be a pity to miss this last
