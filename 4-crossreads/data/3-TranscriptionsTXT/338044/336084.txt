 Notes 
 3rd Oct 1915:- Spent this day in hammock with only one blanket &amp;  fully clothed  The wind howled like fury all day long &amp;  the ship tossed in all directions, whilst I did not care what happened. Too rough for Church Parade. Hospital nearly full of Patients, mostly seasick  Eat nothing all day long  Most miserable day &amp;  still worse night. All I remember clearly is the buglers blowing continuously "No Parade to-day." 
 4th Oct 1915: - 
 Much better to-day. Weather calmer &amp; I eat a fair meal. Still too rough for parade however, &amp;  "No Parade" again sounded. I get out of my retreat &ndash; the hammock in the bathroom &ndash; and have a bed instead. A Peculiar thing is the time, always going back &amp;  nobody has the right time
