Gunderson & gave him a few stores. It was late & a cool trip to the Beach
Thursday Dec 2ndI was busy fixing up matters in connection with the stores & word came through that we could send over a representative to Imbros again. This we decided to do & I was chosen to go over & represent Divisional Artillery. Things were very hurriedly arranged & I had to pack up & get a little dinner & hurry to get the Steamer. I saw several sad sights on my way. There were a number of poor Gurkas & others who had been frost bitten on their feet & could not walk. They had to be carried on to the Pier for transference
