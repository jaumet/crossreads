[Sunday 30 April 1916]
Went to 3 Churches, the Coptic, Armenian & Missionary & the Arabic Christians, the middle one made the most noise & I should think was furthest away.  the first, burnt incense & Candles etc:- the latter the dirtiest- truly there are many ways to Heaven & only one God.Got a wire asking how long I shall be here on the Trial as I'm wanted on the Canal, where there is trouble again & our whole 1st L.H. Brigade are to join again with the ANZAC Light Horse Division. composed of Australian & N Zealands
