<p>7/1/16<br/>white with seagulls. One very imposing light stone building I noticed fronting the water, probably the Customs House. The hospital ship "Assaye" being tugged near us. Issued orders no men are to buy from the bum boat men who come alongside.</p>
<p>The water police are natives and wear blue jackets togs and a fez. A paper seller came alongside and there was a very exciting gesticulatory and vocal encounter between them but the paperman got aboard by stratagem much to the joy of the soldiers. A Lieut. of the native army came on wearing his fez and a pea jacket, his extremely thin legs encased in leggings. A naval native also came aboard clothed in purple and fine linen. These elaborately uniformed officials are a most amusing sideshow.</p>
<p>On shore there are bands of niggers who wander round the wharves and with nets like those for crayfishing dredge out from the eddies and corners enough food and other odds and ends to keep body &amp; soul together. Many of the ships around have their names written in Turkish as well as English. The palms ashore give the whole place that characteristic Eastern look and glimpses of sand recall desert camps and marches. Fruit vendors a nuisance so put a revolver bullet through one boat which had the effect of scaring some off.</p>
<p>Doctor says Pedler will have to go to hospital today and Davis also. It is hoped our advance party has got all ready for us.</p>
