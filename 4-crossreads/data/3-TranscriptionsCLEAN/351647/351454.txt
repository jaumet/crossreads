talk over things & help straighten out the tangles.  You do get things tangled up a bit & you alway want to cut the knots & its so drastic.  I hope things are better that the sea at Manly & the sea breezes at New Port washed & blew away dull care & worries &c., &c.
I'd have given years & years of my life to be able to be there, I'm that full of things over this way, at times I feel I simply can't stand it.
Sometimes I can find a little compensations but after all they do don't absolutely fill up, sort of temporary camouflage.
