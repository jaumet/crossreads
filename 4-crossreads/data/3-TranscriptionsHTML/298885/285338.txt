<p>Cinamon Gardens</p>
<p>I am not going to describe the beauty of these gardens because to be frank, I cannot do it.</p>
<p>On either side we saw large, beautifully, constructed, cool looking bungalows, the properties of either a Cingalese or a European gentleman. Here &amp; there we saw a bungalow which in pre war days was german property.</p>
<p>Passing by the Galle Face Hotel the College and Asylum, all fine buildings we pulled up at the Gate of the Buddhist Temple.</p>
<p>With the aid of the Temple</p>
