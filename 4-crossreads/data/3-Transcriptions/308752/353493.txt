<p>It was not very long before I was into a hot bath, a clean change of clothes &amp; then into bed &amp; it was a relief I can assure you. A big mail awaited me (25 letters) but to tell you the truth I was too tired to read it.</p>
<p>2nd October 1917.<br/>Rested all day but I find it an impossibility to answer my mail,  cannot put my mind on writing letters,  I do not wonder at it either. Eric was at the same post as myself but unfortunately he was at another post when the severe shelling began. The two Dargins from Mosman called to see me today,  the following two days, the bearers did a few fatigues around the rest camp.</p>
<p>4th October 1917.<br/>The bearers move off again towards the Line,  we travel by means of a light railway, raining heavily all the while. Arrive at a dressing station about 7 p.m. &amp; slept in huts for the night.</p>
<p>5th October 17.<br/>Reveille 5 a.m. &amp; a bitterly cold morning it was too,  the winter has started again in earnest. We are conveyed to the Line in lorries &amp; then over on to relieve another ambulance at the different posts. Since we were last in the trenches a great advance had been made, the furthest Post that I was at when first arriving in the straffing last month was not right in the rear. After walking about 2 miles we found that we were not wanted so had to trudge off in another direction. A section were eventually stationed at a Relay Post, the other sections proceeding further on. Our post was an enormous concrete Pill Box, it contained about 9 compartments. Of course there was very little room for the bearers,  just had to squat down where we could. The carry to the next post was not of the best that cursed mud again, but it was not nearly as severe as thos carried down in the Somme last November. All through the night we were kept fairly busy,  sleep was out of the question. The place3 was a home when compared with out last post, very little shelling. General Birdwood visited here this morning &amp; of course plenty of bouquets were chucked at us. One wounded Fritz we carried was only 20 years old.  He could speak English</p>
