<p>17.5.16. Got a good sleep last night and felt fresh this morning. We were dressed straight away and remained so until we disembarked. Nobody had the slightest idea where we were going and we were waiting on the boat deck about 2 hours before getting off. During this period we carried our kits up and down three times by the "foresight" of our brilliant N.C.O's but at last we took everything with us off the boat and then had our black kits taken on by motor transport. We collected some biscuits and other rations on the boat to last us 24 hours. I was sent out as marker on the wharf for our crowd and after hunting for about 30 mins for my place found it and waited until our crowd came off and were led gaily past me by an embarkation officer and I had to chase them. Waited sitting on our kits for another hour and a half and then all being ready we set out for a march and went for about 3 miles to our camp for the night. The route led mainly along the sea frontage and of course we were objects of curiosity all the way. Going was fairly difficult and led to much uncomfort for the fatter members of our party but on arrival I felt quite fresh and revelled in the site of our camp. Arrived about 4. Camp was in a little dale most beautifully situated among houses having lovely gardens full of trees and shrubs running right down to our boundary and a look out over the forts and submarine base of the harbour.

However it was interesting until they had to go to tea promising come next day but we had gone by then. We came down and after grabbing some tea heard there was open camp and immediately walked to the front entrance and passed out as there were no sentries. About six of us <strike>espied</strike> went together but I soon espied a car and hung on with a mob the rest of my friends being unable to obtain a foothold. Rode right into town and first proceeded to a watchmaker and got my watch fixed and then viewed the city. It was some time before I reached the main street the "Bourse" but it was fine. Restaurants and cafes were prominent and further on were the Boulevards with plane trees and shops on each side fine wide streets and the electric cars run either way. At the top is a fine cathedral but name could not be found out. I had travelled a good way and finding that the last car left at 9 asked at a shop for the stopping place and found I was too late. I was waiting outside a restaurant when I saw a chap of our reinforcements and went inside and there met three sergeants and a warrant officer 3 being New Zealanders. We formed up and</p>
