December

think that they had better feed us for the last few days that we are to be in their country.

On the 4th of December I left Luneburg for Soltau Lager together with all the Prisoners that were working at both the Saline Factories.

The men from almost all the working Commando’s have been recalled to Soltau Lager.

I arrived at Soltau at about 10pm and got an issue of Parcels straight away. In Soltau there is almost 1,000 Englishmen, and it is the biggest bunch of Britishers that I have seen in Germany. We all expect to be leaving for England very soon, We may get word to pack up and move any day now. I received a photo of Etta to-day.

For the past week we have had a lot of rumours about leaving for England but up to the present none of them have come true.
