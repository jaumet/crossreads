 Dear Madam, 
 I am directed to transmit, per separate parcel post, the Plaque issued by his Majesty's Government as a memorial to those who made the supreme sacrifice in connexion with the war of 1914-1918, which I trust reaches you safely. 
 It is to be noted that the name inscribed on this memorial is that under which the deceased served and died, and no variation to this rule is permissible. 
 The Plaque, being second-class mail matter, may take a little longer to reach your address. If the delay is excessive would you kindly inquire at your local post office before communicating with this office. 
 Kindly sign and return the attached receipt for (which can be torn off) at your earliest convenience. 
 Yours faithfully, J M Lean Major, Officer i/c Base Records.
