<p>30 August 1916 Wed<br/>At 2 am. I sent a letter on its way to Os. The busiest night we have had since we arrived here some 100 cases came in. It was awful falling &amp; slipping all over the place in the dark in the mud. Raining all day as usual. I slept all day.</p>
<p>31 August 1916 Thur<br/>Raining very heavy. During the afternoon a Canadian field Ambulance come to relieve us. Went up the town to see the Brigade coming through. Saw Ronny &amp; Mac &amp; marched along with them for a little while. Mac was wearing the military cross ribbon. Saw old Jimmie &amp; joined in with him for 100 yds or so</p>
