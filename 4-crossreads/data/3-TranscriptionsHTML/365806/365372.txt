<p>2<br/>the Battalion was in the trenches it occupied Russell's Tap, one of the most important positions in Anzac and when the evacuation of Anzac was contemplated it again took up the same post and held it to the end.</p>
<p>It was in taking up the position the second time that the regrettable loss of our three field Officers occurred, Majors Jenkings, Harcus and Uther being killed by a shrapnel shell.  Lieut. Dodwell was killed two days after and Lieuts. Bailey and McDonald were wounded the former seriously.  This loss of Officers was severely felt by the Battalion as up to that date, no officers had been lost through wounds.</p>
<p>In the evacuation the Battalion was given the post of honour viz the holding of Russell's Top, and the inner line of defence Walker's Ridge and were the last unit to leave Anzac.  The Battalion's part in the evacuation has been most favourably commented upon by the Army Corps</p>
