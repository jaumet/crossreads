to see that we were reported as having mild cases of influenza aboard this is absolutely untrue for there has not been a trace of it everything is all bustle & rush this morning rolling blankets handing hammocks & etc in & getting ready for anything that may come along, quite a lot of telegrams came aboard this morning for various chaps, everything looks so peaceful & quiet there is not a ripple on the water.
9.A.M. After the Drs examined our ship they went off to breakfast & were coming back again to give their decision, now we thought we are set & we dragged off all our belongings up the stairs & stacked them then waited impatiently for the ship to get a move on, every one was ready dressed up to go ashore
