<p>rotten time there in the sand. The heat was pretty bad in the day time but at night it was very cold.<br/>We stayed in the desert for about five weeks digging trenches and waiting if the Turks come; but they didn't come and we were relieved by N.Z. Mounted Rifles. We went to Ismalia where we stayed ten days and then we left for France. The trip over wasn't too bad and we are here now waiting for the word to let go. It is hard work waiting but we'll make up for it when the time comes.<br/>This is all I can write now. So I close. Love to all from your loving son.<br/>Roy.</p>
