Friday 8 NovemberMarch from Villers to Hangest where we entrain & move off en route to Epehy, just north of Roisel.
Saturday 9 NovemberYe Gods! we have only reached Epehy this evening after thirty hours to do 90 miles.  In fact one stop lasted at Roisel for 7 hours. Epeny is of course just West of the Hindenburg System & the country is devastated.
