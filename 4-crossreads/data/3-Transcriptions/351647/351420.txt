<p>I do hope they get home O.K.  I am rambling on.  I suppose you are home again, its ages since I heard.  I often look at the snaps of Graham, I liked the one outside the window of my old room, gracious how he is growing, I see a change in the garden by the snaps.  How is it looking &amp; how are the roses &amp; those lilacs.  And are the Iris still progressing &amp; all those new fruit trees.  Does the banana still bear.  I see the river was in flood again in October.  What a year I've missed.  Did you have a good trip &amp; did the Nurse get engaged or anything.</p>
