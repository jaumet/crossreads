  
 All night the ice grew thicker and thicker and by midnight "Wolf" was crashing through a thick continuous field of drift-ice.   It was impossible to proceed.  In the early morning she was obliged to turn south and spent the day veering in various directions. 
 Sat 9th Feb. The dash due East to the Norwegian coast commenced. 
 Sun. We are kept below all day now that we are on the final dash.   The Doctors still assure us that we are to intern in Norway! 
 "Wolf" is well crippled;   leaking badly (the pumps stopped on the Kaiser's birthday in the hurricane when 40 tons of water were pouring into her an hour).   Her speed is only about 10 knots.   The passengers asked to be allowed to use our piano for a service tonight.   The proposal was voted against and declined on Webbie promising rag-time as a substitute.
