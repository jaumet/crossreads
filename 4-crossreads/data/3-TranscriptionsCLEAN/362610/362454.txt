  
 Saturday 26 August 1916 A very broken rest only obtained owing to there being 4 of us in the compartment. About 4a.m. the train pulled up at a new siding close to Poperinghe in Belgium. It was raining, & this showery weather continued right through the morning but gave place to a perfect sunny afternoon. It took some time to get the transport off the trucks & everything ready to move off, & then we had considerable difficulty in finding our camp. Hop fields with hops in bloom very noticeable after having been down south. People apparently low bred & talking an unknown language. Had breakfast by the roadside as best we could & eventually reached our quarters in ruberoid huts about 11 o'clock. In the afternoon went with the Brigade Major on horseback to meet the 4th Bn. at the station, & greatly enjoyed the couple of hours ride, reaching home about 5 o'clock. A perfect evening.
