<p>is not varied or appetising but then 'C'est la Guerre' so no grousing.  We have seen a bit more of France since I last wrote.  I can't go into particulars but is it not all down in my diary &amp; I shall enlarge on it when I get back.</p>
<p>It is simply great this France &amp; the people &amp; their spirit.  I think they are wonderful.</p>
<p>I haven't heard much of Poss, he is getting on all right.  The two Charley boys are with us still &amp; are well.  I have seen more of the 14 fellows lately.  I really think I'll get back there if I can.  They do shine out in comparison to this mob.  The Macnamara boys are well &amp; both Sergeants.  Billie Balcombe &amp; Squiz Williams &amp; Brolga Hill all well &amp; thriving.</p>
<p>I struck a little shop here where they sold silk stuffs.  I hope you wouldn't mind such a piffling thing but I saw a little silk thing fairly plain but a gorgeous colour &amp; I knew you'd like it even if it were only for the colour so I've sent it out &amp; hope you like it &amp; get it.  They had some lovely silk embroidered scarves &amp; cushion covers &amp; blouses.  Most natural looking flowers I've ever seen.  I'd love to have bought them all &amp; sent out but I spend nearly all my money on extra grub.</p>
<p>I never told you I have most of your letters &amp; that</p>
