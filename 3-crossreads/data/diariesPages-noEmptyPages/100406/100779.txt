There has been some sand bagging around here lately so there was a big raid this morning every one outside the limits of his own camp was gathered even if he had a pass. Our Dental Parade came back under escort from Saint-Ouen the Sgt. Major had to go out at intervals through the day rescuing Blighty leave men other fellows who had leave passes to Amiens, Picquigny other towns.
Visited Amiens yesterday. Was surprised at the number of Civilians who have returned there. Business is in full swing although a whole pane of Glass is quite a curiosity.
