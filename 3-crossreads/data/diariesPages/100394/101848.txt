September 2
Mater’s Birthday. Got paid this morning and while we were away getting it our billet tumbled in so we were jolly lucky. I am also mess orderly today

[Partly written under Sept. 2 entry] Sept 3rd Jackson and I went and had lunch and afternoon tea in Cassell. It is a fine old Town and we wandered into all sorts and of back streets and aired our French We even wandered into une bonne fete and it tried to explain it was mine also and greeted Madamoselle with "[indecipherable] vous [indecipherable]une bonne fete" Slept in a marquee and it was fearfully cold.

I only got word last night that I was to report at D.A. this morning at 6.30 to go to a Signalling School. Slept at waggon lines last night. Got into motor omnibus and came into Steenwecke where we took train to Hazebroek changed trains and on to Cassell. Entered another ominbus and came on here (Zupteene) about 2 miles from Cassell. In the afternoon [continued under Sept 3rd entry entered above.]
September 4
The bigger part of us are in an old Chateau. I am undergoing a linesman’s course. A very good recreation room and wet and dry canteen is here, also library. We get war news daily by wireless and I fancy we get news before the papers. My course is going to take a month. The wireless course takes 3 months. We went through all kinds of different cables and wires today
