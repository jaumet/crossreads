 31-3-18 Still at St Gratien spent a pleasant evening with some civilians who thought the Aussies were  some    soldiers. I recited "How the Chestnut Horse came home" had some great fun. 
 1-4-18 Left for Esbart again &amp; issued in the Chateau grounds. Found a better billet this time had a house to ourselves. 
 3-4-18 Left Esbart for Behencourt where we stayed for a few weeks enjoying ourselves. Fritz made it willing now &amp; again two Tommies were wounded opposite our front door. 
 Played the 34th Battery (Tommies) football &amp; beat them twice. Played wing &frac34; &amp; in the second match I scored a nasty knee but thanks to the 12th Fld Ambulance it was soon mended.
