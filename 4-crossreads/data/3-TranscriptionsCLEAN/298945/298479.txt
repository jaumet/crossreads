x Wednesday 25th Sept
We left the A.D.S relieved by the Yanks at about 6 p.m on Monday. I was part of the advance guard, for the main body of the Division did not leave till about midnight. We marched halfway to Roisel where we were picked up by a passing lorry & conveyed to the German shell dump the Hamlet side of Tincourt
On the way back we passed the American infantry on the way in to relieve our boys, & there was, one long stream from the A.D.S. to Tincourt, (where we stayed), & beyond. Since then, the number of Americans moving towards the line was tremendous. In addition, on both evenings there has been a move towards the line of numbers of tanks. If this was not sufficient we soon learned from other sources of a projected attack on the Hindenburg Line, which is to take place, I believe, on Friday morning.
