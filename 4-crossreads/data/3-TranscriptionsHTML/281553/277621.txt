<p>en route.  Took photo of our 'Straglers Transport' and when within about 2 miles of destination had to leave donkeys and put our gear on Transport Camels.  Later on various units separating had to unload &amp; waited for return of empty camels which I hired for use of our party.  While waiting in open sands caught in very heavy storm getting well nigh soaked, reached camp site about 3pm. &amp; found tents up so sorted ourselves out &amp; parted.  Night's sleep much appreciated.</p>
