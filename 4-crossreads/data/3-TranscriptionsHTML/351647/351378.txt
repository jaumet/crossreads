<p>Good night, thanks for all your extreme niceness to me.  We'll have some real good yarns when I come home.  There is a bit of a strafe on tonight but I'm used to that now &amp; I shan't forget the first night at Albert though I was scared to death but I couldn't help giggling.  Wonderful how soon one gets used to it.  Good night.</p>
<p>Yours<br/>Wilkie</p>
