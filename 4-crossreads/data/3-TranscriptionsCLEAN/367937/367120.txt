 My dear Mother and Father I wrote to Mother last night but could not get much in on that paper so will write to you both now.  I can only tell you all the minor details but suppose you will be interrested in them. Here is a list of some of the things we are not to put in letters. Date and place of dispatch Names and numbers of transports & escorts Numbers & descriptions of troops Disposition of force Route & ports of call Criticism judged harmfull References to larger units & superior commanders. My word I am thankful that I am such a good sailor
