 one of our Baloons yesterday &amp; apparently done some damage because a few minutes later two little dolls slipped over the side &amp; came down with parachutes. One started half a minute before the other and landed 3 minutes  strike>after   before him. I think the second must have been killed because he came down at a tremendous rate much too quickly for safety. The Baloon must have been attached to a motor because we could see it travelling away. In fact we thought at first that the shell had curt the rope &amp;   th  thus caused the observers to descend but the Baloon afterward came down &amp; reascended some distance from its original possy. 
 I leave for Paris at 7.59 tomorrow morning. 
 Thursday 20.3.18 Arrived at Paris at 8.20P.M on Tuesday night. Yesterday we went to Versailles. Missed the coach this morning after a visit to Pepiniere Barracks. Had a trip with Louis Parsons instead. We went to the Invalides, Napoleon's tomb, Big Wheel, Trocadero, Eiffel Tower Arc de Triumphe. Had two tiptop feeds &amp; then done the Folies Begere, about the liveliest place  I've seen  in a very lively City. Had plenty of fun &amp; no "Gutsers" N.B. we went with a "Mackerel" (To be explained later) A feature of the pace was a Yankee M.P. with a very persuasive looking truncheon [shorthand]
