<p>My dear Father,</p>
<p>This writing tablet is the biggest inducement to write, I have yet had; because even though I have nothing to say, I don't have to fill several pages in saying it. Today I left the old dug-out, which I had come to look on as my new home, &amp; have taken up my quarters some mile or so away from it. Yesterday I was posted to "A" Coy as second in command, &amp; this morning was ordered, the company commander being incapacitated, to take the company to a new position, &amp; so here I am in solitary state, with no senior officers to criticise <strike>how</strike> my way of doing things. The remainder of the battalion will probably join me in a day or two. My new home is very comfortable, already being furnished with table, bed &amp; pigeon holes. On the table are cigarettes, pipes, tobacco, matches, one lighted candle, writing blocks, magazines, Barrack Room Ballads &amp; the Golden Treasury, &amp; the day out itself is fairly 'oozing out smoke. I was sorry to be separated from Walter who has gone to "C" Coy but is not yet back to duty. In case I don't get another chance to write before Christmas mail closes, I wish all a very happy Christmas &amp; tell mother not to worry about me because I'm going to have the happies Christmas I've ever spent.</p>
<p>Your Affectionate son<br/><u>Arthur</u></p>
