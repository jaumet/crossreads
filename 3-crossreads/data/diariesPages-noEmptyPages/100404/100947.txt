Monday 28th Had busy day as I was chasing round various camps pinching begging odds and ends. The 3rd LH Bde left to-day for Serapim and I received nearly all their tables chairs and surplus drugs of the 10th LH. I fixed everything up nice and comfortable and by night time I had the hospital tent looking like a chemists shop. Wrote two letters home and received three more.
Tuesday 29th Last day of Leap Year. What a time the girls in Australia must be having. I spent the whole day dispensing medicines. I made up four gallons of cough mixture Pot Chlor, Astringents, Soda Salays etc. I made enough to last me for a month. Dr prescribed and I dispensed. It was a busy day for me as I am unaided and doing four men's work I was going from 6 am to 8 pm.
Wednesday 1st March Hot day miserably so, after a busy day decided to run into O?Rs to get away from the desert heat. Rec three more letters from home. Sullie went back to Mena to-day. 
Thursday 2nd March One of those cursed dusty days It blew all day all my drugs dressings were coated inches deep with thick dust. To-day was the anniversary of the formation of the 12th Reg and the men had a half holiday whilst the officers had a spread, it will soon be my second anniversary.
Friday 3rd March Five AMC men were sent over to-day by mistake so I took one and the others were sent back. I want to keep the place open for my young brother. 
Saturday 4th Mar. In a m over at drug store I met an old schoolmate there and consequently did very well as I obtained more than my req.
