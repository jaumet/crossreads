Saturday
Safely through another night. Sea continues as calm as mill-pond. Destroyers come go convoying us all the way. A British Submarine passed us this afternoon, first I've seen. Thankful it was flying British ensign. 
About 6 p.m. a submarine alarm was sounded -- for practice. Did not realise twas only for practice at first, great excitement scurrying to get to places, don life-belts. Chap sprained his ankle in the rush.
