A cold windy day again  I found a warm spot in sun and read all day. Got some tarts & cocoa in the forward galley in the afternoon & had a good afternoon tea. It has been arranged for certain that we land at Durban and have a short route march & then we are dismissed. There are "Mother Carys" chickens following us all the time also the big albatrosses we saw in the bight.
