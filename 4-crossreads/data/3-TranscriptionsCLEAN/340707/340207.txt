Room is a chaos of disorder but Brise is a gem & soon place is straight enough to sleep in. I dine with Brise & then collect baggage from Gare du Nord, & then see Brise home.
On the afternoon I had collected baggage from Marignon & said good bye to Rue du Sommerard. Although I had given over my room 5 days before leaving yet lady refused to let me have one night in addition & I told the maid she might have compromised
24-7-19Rose 9 am & at 9.30 Brise arrived with cheese, bread, coffee, milk etc & went out for warm milk. We start in to clean up & in course of a thorough search find punaise in the divan. This causes great consternation & energetic measures are taken
Brise is desolated for she has found these rooms for me & is ashamed of her recommendation I on the other hand am quite pleased
25-7-19Brise arrives early again armed
