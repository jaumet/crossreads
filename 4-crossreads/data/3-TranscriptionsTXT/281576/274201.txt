 Tues.    Mar  April 3.  The Y.M.C.A. Hut manager sent in today to know if we would put on our Show on Thursday night, so we are busy now arranging a Programme. 
 Wed. 4.  Good news in the Paper at last.  America coming in the War.  So now we are hoping that Fritz will throw up the sponge &amp; let us get back to Sunny New South.         Hooray.  Mail came in.  Got 3 Letters from M.S.  Now I can write a decent Letter in return.  The Prince of Wales attended the Anzac Show in Albert.  Bob Roberts offered to put us in the seat among the Heads, but we have a rehearsal on, &amp; I can't afford the time. 
 Thurs.    Mar  April 5.  Commenced  Letter to M.S.  Glorious day, sun shining gloriously.  Plenty of planes about.  George Hand went into Amiens, so I was left to run the Show. Johnnie Moore also went to Amiens &amp; failed to return.  Horrie Playford &amp; Wally Saunders did not like to go on without him, so Freddy Saunders had the Piano to himself.  He did very well too.  Everything went off very well &amp; the crowd was most appreciative.
