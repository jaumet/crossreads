  
 December 4 From 8th to 12th, the first of the new drafts away for England:  from 1st Div. men - up to June and past.  2nd draft rumoured for 18th-20th - if our leave is granted, back to time will bring England closely following. 
 Old Tom away on special English leave, takes to post old collection of maps and papers. 
 No mail. 
 22. Later.  Tonight, alone reading Thompson's "Poppy" and each following reading the lulling sweet musick has broken it. 
 But where I go your face goes too To watch lest I play false to you 
 and Bill's face has come to my mind, shall I know how well? - or shall I just have his friendly smile and acquaintance till H.Q.s are left for home?  He remains:  and a 1917 man he'll be a long while here - each day - how can he help it! - coming more and more under the horrible influence of Ken.  Then the laugh comes - twice we have known each other well - twice then we were half drunk - Christmas day and on N. Year's eve. 
 Tonight to sleep in the Lodge - under that damnable bell that rings early about 7, at 8 and 9!
