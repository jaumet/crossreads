<p>8 September 1918<br/>Sunday<br/>15 After Trinity</p>
<p>Reported British advancing all along the Line in several places being back in the old positions evacuated in March. Beautiful weather &amp; seas. Expect to be in Fremantle early in the morning.</p>
<p>1918 September 9<br/>Monday<br/>Arrived Fremantle about 7.30 am. About 140 men were dropped here &amp; the remainder were given Leave in the afternoon. Sgt Clark Brindley Rees &amp; another Sgt &amp; I went per motor to Perth where we spent a couple of hours. Perth appears to be a nice little City &ndash; also Fremantle. Had an enjoyable afternoon &amp; got back to the Boat about 7. P.M.</p>
