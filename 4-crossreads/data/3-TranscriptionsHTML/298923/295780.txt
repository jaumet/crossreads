<p>24 April 1918 Wednesday (X to X crossed out)<br/>Land of Moab<br/>Very hot glad to be near the J.  Thought I was alright for leave but found I was not.  <strike>General C. said I had been away too much!!!-</strike><u>after 3 &frac12;  years</u>!! &amp; on duty <strike>at that.</strike>   However the war can't last for ever-<br/>Had a swim in <strike>Jordan</strike> swift current hard water from <strike>Mica</strike> sulphur gypsum sand it runs through.  Not as big as the Edwards but plenty scrub along bank, X don't think I'll have to pay for those troughs &amp; reservoirs I had stolen now- the Bill 52/-/- was too stiff altogether.X</p>
