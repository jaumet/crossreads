 Storm still raging & we are only just holding our own- Some talk of going into  Brest,  but skipper wants to hold on to  Gibraltar   No Australian  officers  men on board but  3  Australian Officers  I have been in a few bad storms but this one is the worst. Have stuck to my berth most of the time.  The Steering gear is mended (we were going round & round & drifting or) being blown on to the French coast.  & we are at the mercy of any submarine I quite expected a [indecipherable]- as skipper sent a wireless to say we were in trouble.
