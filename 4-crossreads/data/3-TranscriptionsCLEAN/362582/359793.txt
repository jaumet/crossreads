sent here - everything is so full of interest and the drives are beautiful, mostly avenues of huge trees with autumn foliage. The coloring in this country is marvelous. To-morrow is Sunday & I've promised Matron to get up & go to Communion with her so must stop now. I hope you are all well & happy and that things are going smoothly. If Belle has time, I think I would like to know, what my banking account is now, & tell them to write often. Fondest love & kisses to you all. From, your loving sister, Edith
