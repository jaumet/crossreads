  
 and he informed me that was in hand & they had brought him back to the cemetery at Bull's Road so that the spot would be marked for all time as the French people hand over all sites of cemeteries to the British Nation in perpetuity.  The C/o said the Bn was to do him the honor of erecting the cross to his memory & it will state erected to his memory "By the Bn".  They are to let me know when it is completed so that I can get the Official photographer to take one & I will let you have it immediately. 
 It must have been an awful shock to you all as it was to me, for from the minute we met we palled up & got on splendidly & we had such a good holiday together. 
 It was strange how we met.  I saw his name on the recommendation for his Military Medal when it was being awarded.  I immediately tried to get into touch with him but we were about 12 miles distant & on the move daily. 
 Then the recommendation came along for his Commission & by that time we were only 5 miles apart & I went to see him & from then onwards we were friends as if we had known one another intimately all our lives. 
 He was one of the finest characters I have ever known in my life.  As straight as a man could be & his men and brother officers thought the world of Fred & he died trying to relieve the sufferings of one of his men.  In fact one could say he gave his life trying to save Burns & a more Noble Death one could not wish to have.  I would like to be able to write my thoughts but I cannot express them still I trust you will be able to read between the lines. 
 Owing to the long time that elapsed before I heard of it
