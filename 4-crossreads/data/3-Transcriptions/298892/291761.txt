<p>France, 16th. Septr. 1917.</p>
<p>My dear Parents/.<br/>Mother has kept me well supplied with books lately and I have had a good opportunity of reading them. To-day I received "Senator North" and also "The Metropolis" by Upton Sinclair.<br/>The Y.M.C.A. have opened a library here and for the sum of one franc one can become a member and after the last book is returned the franc is refunded. Their supply of books is fairly limited but I was able to secure "The Common Law" by Chambers, and "One of Marlborough's Generals" both of which proved very interesting. I also read "Red Court Farm" by Mrs. Henry Woods so that I have been faring very well as regards literature.</p>
