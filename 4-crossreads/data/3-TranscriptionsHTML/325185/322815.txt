<p>very long as I am one of the oldest hands in the Batt. now. There are very few with a no. as low as mine now all the others are gone. Well we had our first fall of snow yesterday morning. Fell fairly thick while it lasted but only lasted about an hour. There was quite enough for the lads to have a bit of snowballing.Today the ground is frozen. Reminds one of France last winter in Feb. One could hardly stand the ground was so slippery it is just the same here today we will be walking along when suddenly the feet go from under you. There were some nasty falls reported. One sgt fell &amp; broke his back. Others are reported in camp with broken arms. The ground gets just like glass is impossible to walk on it. It certainly looks very nice when the ground is covered with snow but is very cold. I pity the poor devils in France in France just now. It will be very cold in the line now. Then when it starts to thaw well it will be the same old tale up to your knees in slush &amp; slime. Oh well we went through it last winter so I dare say can do the same again this one. I don't know how long it will be before I go back about the end of this month or early next. The arm is pretty right again is still a bit stiff but dare say it will wear off in time. We have had our voting for the conscription across here. I think it will go through this time that is across here. The men appear to be more for it this time than the last time. I have voted against it myself  not that don't think they should be across here But the majority of them wouldint be any good when they did get here. Have seen quite enough across in the Batt the last few months. We didn't know what was meant by deserters. But I am sorry t say now we do. It is only some of those that were afrid of</p>
