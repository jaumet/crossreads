<p>[This appears to be the reply to Weston's message on page 9, dated 24/9/17.  It is written by WMB Cory military number 307]<br/>Lieut Weston 24.9.17<br/>By bearer 1 Gun &amp; spare parts case to replace damaged ones. Am not sending any belts &amp; boxes to replace the 2 of yours blown up &ndash; both runners to remain with you tonight, one coming in in morning with report. If your spare parts case was undamaged please return the one I'm sending. If using phone to us use BAB - Battn must have a copy.</p>
<p>Re coordination &ndash; I think the one you give is wrong viz J3d 7 8 should be probably J3C 8 7.<br/>One letter for you herewith.<br/> WM Cory Lt<br/>[there is a small diagram which appears to be explaining Weston's error in his co-ordinates]</p>
