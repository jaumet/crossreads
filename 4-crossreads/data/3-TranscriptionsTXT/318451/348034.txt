 Saturday 25th Nov. We billeted in Merris.  I stayed at the old French priests place.  The Town was at one time in the German hands &amp; bears a few marks of the Bombardment.  The Church &amp; Convent were hit by shells.  A levy of 5,000 francs was made on the Town &amp; the priest Honore Beleyat was held as a hostage to be shot if it was not forthcoming.  It was raised.  Had hot bath this evening &amp; turned in &amp; slept soundly. 
 Sunday 26 Orders came early this morning to pack up &amp; move to the trenches.  Quite unexpected.  Motor Transport conveyed us to Armentiers. We were from 1 oclock till after dark before we found Billets &amp; had to sleep without blankets on the floor.  It was very cold.  The Town has normally a populace of about 35,000 including Houplines suburb but there are less than 3,000 in it now.  Houses are wrecked.  Beautiful Buildings in ruins, Churches in a very bad way.  Almost every church is in ruins &amp; many lovely private homes smashed up.  Half of our men went into the subsidiary trenches today.
