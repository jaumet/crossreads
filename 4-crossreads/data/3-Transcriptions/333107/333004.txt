<p>Fri. Feb 8<br/>Beards went away of Furlough today and Jem Cody returned. Toby gave me a hand in Bill's place. Went to Concert at Y.M.C.A. "Perham Stars", the Camp Concert Party run by Lieut Shemallich. On my return I found a Letter from M.S. it was in answer to my first letter from Brighton.</p>
<p>Sat. 9<br/>Rotten day. Wind and Rain. The U Boats have sunk an American Transport, with a loss of 210 Lives.</p>
<p>Things are quiet. There are <u>no</u> news of the War in the papers.</p>
<p><u>Wrote Letter No 6 to M.S. Lill's Mother's Birthday</u></p>
<p>Sun. 11<br/>Finished work about 2. Toby, Bob and I walked into Warminster. It is not a bad little Town. It was full of soldiers. It is a very pleasant walk, about 3 miles from our Camp.</p>
<p>A Lovely day, but wind a bit cool. Got back about 6 and had Tea. Then we wandered over to our Hut and had a yarn with the Fire Brigade Sergeant. He was at Serapeum and many other places in Egypt the same time as we were.</p>
<p>I should have written some Letters today, but going into Warminster put me off.</p>
<p>I'm getting my photos tomorrow from Reynolds. Hope they are alright, as they are very anxious to get one at Home. B.E. will be forgetting what I'm like.</p>
