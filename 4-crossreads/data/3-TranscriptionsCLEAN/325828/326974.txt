                         put in most of the day reading, writing & sleeping- in fact I was asleep when your letter was brought into the tent with some for the other boys.I am very pleased to hear that dear old Mrs. Morrison is still keeping well.  Please remember me kindly to her, Father dear, & tell her I hope I will be able to shake her by the hand before long, if I am spared.I am keeping in splendid health & am in tip-top spirits.Must close now with love to you all at home,Your loving son,Leo.[Sideways on page]  1st Sept.Three or 4 days ago Wal paid me a surprise visit & I found out then where he was camped & yesterday I went out & paid him a birthday visit.  I was able to give him later home news than he had received.  He was looking well, & will probably be writing by this mail also  Drenching rains.Love Leo.
