Yesterday there was the most unpleasant  &  most impressive sandstorm that I have yet witnessed in this land of sorrow. It was like an enormous curtain of dust stretching from the earth right up to the clouds, breaking down on one, swallowing up the country as it came. There was not a breath of wind until the curtain of dust was about 20 yards away  &  then, in a second, one was in a swirling dusty twilight  &  objects more than two or three yds away were invisible. It lasted an hour  &  was said to be the worst they have had for six years.
