  Copy to Mother  No. 2 General Hospital Mena Camp Cairo 28.1.15. My dearest old Mrs. My last letter was from Alexandria dated 17th Jany.   On the [blank] I left Alexandria in charge of an advance party of our unit with instructions to proceed to Mena & pitch our hospital.   I had with me 5 officers & 50 men.   The train journey between Alexandria & Cairo was very interesting - we traversed the Nile Delta for 3 1/2 hours & it is just like a succession of Chinamen's gardens.   Every inch of the land is irrigated & under cultivation.   We passed numerous Arab villages - these are really a conglomeration of mud huts housing human beings, camels, donkeys, sheep, goats & dogs.   From Cairo we proceeded by tram to Mena distant about 10 miles.   Here we are camped under the shadow of the Great Pyramid & close to the large Mena House, in times of peace a fashionable hotel and the resort of the society of Europe & of America.   The advance party was joined after a couple of days by the rest of our unit - in the meantime we made a start in getting the tents pitched.   I have since been in charge of the camp & am entrusted with the task of getting the whole camp in order.   Mena House has been used as a hospital for the more serious cases
