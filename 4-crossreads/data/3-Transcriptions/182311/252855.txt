<p>My Dear People,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Back at the War&quot;.&nbsp; After my telegram saying that I was staying a further six weeks at Cambridge for the Clare College Staff Course, you will wonder at this.&nbsp; But this is just what happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing successfully a five weeks preparatory course at Tidworth, the A.I.F. Headquarters sent us on to Cambridge but upon arrival there we found the school full and ourselves unexpected; there was no other course but to ask for further orders which came &quot;Report at London.&quot;&nbsp; Then at Horseferry Road we heard that we were wanted in France and received orders to return by next boat.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; No leave?&nbsp; said we, and it was so, though we made a very dignified request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is our job to fight and not to go taking leave around the pleasant places of Britain; for I had mapped out a very nice tour during the leave that I fully expected to get.&nbsp; Now I&#39;m back with the Regiment, we have just come down from the trenches for a few days rest, when we will go back again, also on territory recently captured from the enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately I&#39;ve taken walks to places of much interest in our neighbourhood.&nbsp; I&#39;ll tell you about them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It is a place that has figured very much in the newspapers lately, a small town standing high on a ridge,</p>
