<p>at Gaza are doing splendid reconoitring work against the Turks I can just imagine it and only wish I was back there and to think that the Curs here have forsaken their own flesh &amp; blood and prevented comforts and provisions from reaching them. Tongue cannot express how our boys will feel it. Wishing Mr Wilson &amp; yourself the best of health</p>
