<p>The cause of the trouble!<br/>The recreation grounds have been closed on account of two internees attempting to escape.<br/>Are 5000 men to suffer for this?<br/>Outside the police forbids all the accumulation of the public on account of the influenca, here we are herded into the smallest possible space.<br/>Latrine tubs wer not emptied for 5 days. Last night we emptied them into the drainage. Several of us hav been put into jail for doing this<br/>Some men have been put into Sing-Sing probably as suspected ringleaders.          For 9 days we are without bread. We are now consuming what is left in the kitchen, then rations have been refused to us since yesterday.  Today we had only a plate of porridge and some peas.<br/>The public should know these facts as soon as possible.</p>
