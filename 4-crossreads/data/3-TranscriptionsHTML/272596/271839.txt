<p>people behind him, what a slug for old Asquith &amp; his pro-German crowd [see notes below].</p>
<p>3rd. Finished coaling about 11 o'clock this morning, I shall not forget our morning in Colombo, it was the hottest I have ever felt not a breath of wind &amp; a pitiless sun, it was a touch of hell, they posted a notice up to the effect that stowaways were suspected of being on board &amp; that if they were caught between here &amp; Australia we would all be put in quarantine for a considerable time this must have frightened our lads for shortly afterwards they caught one, he belonged to our Battalion, while coming home he had been taken bad &amp; put off at Colombo &amp; there he has to stop while the town is quarantined, there are 4 of them altogether &amp; they keep on trying every ship, with the hope of getting away, I feel sorry for them.</p>
