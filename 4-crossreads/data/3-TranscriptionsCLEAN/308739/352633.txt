  
 Sunday 2 January 1916 Church Service today, not feeling too bright.  Wrote Home also to Col. Fuller. Old Soldiers in Hospital are a source of real trouble & annoyance to the medical Profession in so far as to let the novice into the tricks of securing a passage Home.  Among this common dodges patients make up small rolls or Balls of ordinary Soap, & then  cut  swallow same.  The result is that the Heart beats furiusly & the temperature rises, & the Drs. are at a loss to know how to treat the invalid, the result is Discharged Malinger. 
 Monday 3 January 1916 Daily Examination by Dr., raining all day, large numbers of men both coming & going each day. Others patients try to sham Deafness & loss of voice, & back ache.  Others again try to be insane, whilst a goodly number inflict Bodily Harm by shooting themselves in the Hand or feet.  The penalty if caught is severe, but many still try the old dodges & some get through. 
 Tuesday 4 January 1916 Examined by Dr. today - asked to be allowed to leave & return to Regiment.  Granted.  I went to Maadi & saw Col. Fuller who willingly agreeded to take me back as His Batman, returned to Hospital at 7 p.m.  The thought of getting away from Hospital Life is pleasant, for though they treated me Hansomely, too much of a good thing becomes tiresome.  This Large German Hotel is certainly very handy for convalesents who soon get strong after a few weeks of good food & gentle exercise. 
 Wednesday 5 January 1916 Got my discharge from Helouan Al-Hayat Con. Home.  Came direct to Maadi Camp & took up my Duties with Col. Fuller.  He occupies a one roomed stone Hut built by Lieu Chisholm.  Everything in Camp is upside down owing to Regiment just arriving in from Oasis Camp at Heliopolis.  Letters arrived from Home & Mrs. Robson & Miss Sarginson. There are very few of the Old Hands now in Camp, as many have returned to Aus. or died at the Front.
