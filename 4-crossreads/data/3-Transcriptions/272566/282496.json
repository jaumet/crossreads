<p>Thursday 22 February</p>
<p>In the morning we were passing the time away in the Salvation Army and Y.M.C.A. Huts.  At 3 o'clock everyone in the camp had to fall in and we were marched down to the boat.  Great crowds watched us march along the streets singing.  The singing soon stopped when we arrived at the wharf.  We five remained on deck.  Moved out from the wharf at 8 p.m.<br/>The huge hospital ship Aquitania was in port when we left.</p>
