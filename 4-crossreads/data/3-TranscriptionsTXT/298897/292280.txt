The water supply practically failed & men out in the trenches had a very bad time having to drink in some cases soapy & other discarded water the reserve tanks being drawn on.  The matter was so serious that those in command actually sent in a communication that they would have to withdraw from the tenches if the water was not supplied within a few hours.  Men on fatigue duties used all manner of subterfuges to get into hospital for treatment if only for a few hours.  Even when the men get the water it is so hot that it almost makes them ill to drink it & certainly does not satisfy thirst.  The wet canteen has been doing a roaring trade a new shipment of Carlton beer having arrived.  Am afraid that my tunic containing a couple of 100 P.T. notes has been pinched or rather confiscated by some person who claims a prior right to it.  Our present camp is called railhead, being the terminus of the railway line from Ferry Post, Camels carrying water & other supplies to the trenches.  Even gippies & camels go out to the heat so that 'tis not much shame for an Australian to do so.
