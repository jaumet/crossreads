 Got a letter from Bert stating he was sailing for Australia today.  Sunday 21st . We have a compulsory service here every Sunday. Local clergymen fulfil this duty. Our present home St. Chads' Voluntary Aid Division Hospital, in peace time was the residence of an elderly gentleman. It is a beautiful two  storied  story building, design semi-ancient half modern. Well laid out lawns and garden surround it. A good croquet lawn is patronised by the boys. It is an ideal home for the convalescent. Many military cadets are being trained in and around Cambridge. Students from every British and Colonial army included. Many civilians being put through course. Most of our Australian boys can sport a Military distinction ribbon and many wear as 3 gold stripe (wounded). Fancy being trained besides
