 Tues Dec 17th:- Marched from Thy-le-Chateau through Somzee &amp; Gerpinnes to Acoz, a little scattered quarrying district about 5 kilometres from Chatelet.

 Thurs Dec 19th:- A trip through Boufflioulx &amp; Chatelet &amp; by tram into Charleroi. All mining district around this way. By train out to Marchienne. 
 Xmas Day 1918 Wed:- Had our Xmas Eve spree in Charleroi last night. This morning &amp; dinner with Bn at Acoz &amp; again into Charleroi for afternoon &amp; evening. Plenty of dancing in the estaminets.
