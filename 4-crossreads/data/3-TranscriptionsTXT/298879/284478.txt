 December 1915 Monday 6 Dull. Heavy firing at Suvla Bay and Cape Helles. 
 Tuesday 7 Fine day. Some chaps back today. Len Poupard who was badly wounded the first day has returned. Our trench works were a revelation to him as there were only bushes to be seen when we landed. The Navy is doing a tremendous amount of shooting from our waters. Received welcome letters from Matt and Clare
