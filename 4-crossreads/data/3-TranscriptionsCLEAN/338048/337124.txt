  
 was to act as No 6. on a detachment after breakfast. The horse allotted to me was already saddled and after much hurry was in time for parade at 8 a.m. There is a great deal of work here to be done in a very little time. The Tommies manage all right by going without a wash between stables & breakfast but we will not do that. 
 I had a very good time out all day as No. 6 who has the hardest job of all. Good horsemanship is required for this but as the pace never exceeded a walk & as the horse knew the work thoroughly I got on well - We returned about 3-30 p.m. as all horses must be in about 3 p.m. and after being paid 3-10-0 - had dinner (I have a snack at midday). Tea was on shortly after & then a kit inspection was held about 6 pm. in our own time. Worn out underclothing is to be replaced very shortly and inspection was mainly to see what replacements were necessary. 
 Tuesday 8th Mess orderly today so no parades for me except roll call at 5-20 a.m. Duties are to get the meals & to wash up the china utensils in hot water drying evidently not being considered necessary. This does not take long so I have plenty of spare time. Walk through villages at night.
