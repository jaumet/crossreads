<p>Let me hope that Maria will do well with Walter Bentley.  Please congratulate Dr Dunn on the arrival of a son, also Mrs Dunn.  Starting a family.  Nothing better.  Why should you and Kitty "become hungry".</p>
<p>Kitty dear:/ Mr Weston is on the Orsova.  I must write a line to Suez, catching him there on the journey Northward.  I hope that you were able to go to the ship to see him.  He would have been going to Brisbane the day after you wrote.  Happy as Larry my dear.</p>
<p>Until you meet with an Egyptian fly you will never know what a persistent sluggard can accomplish.  To shake him off is a difficult undertaking.  It is little wonder that he children native to this soil give up the contest from early life and not till fully grown attempt the struggle once more.  To climb the Sphynx is not a task.  To reach the top of the Grand Pyramid is thought by some persons to be difficult, but it is little more so than stepping up stairs, large wide and high steps some, but not beyond the power of the ordinary man or woman for that matter. Nan was a very naughty girl not to write to me while she was in Sydney, tell her that she will never be forgiven.</p>
<p>You must be improving in the knowledge of gardening when you can do so well in the small plot at No. 219.  The flower of the green lily is peculiar in shape when forming and when fully blown, your drawing shows good intent, practice this further, because facile illustrating makes a letter or book more replete with interest.  The fern will be large when I return.  Love to Buddie.  Kind regards to Jim Roach, a faithful friend to Florrie.</p>
