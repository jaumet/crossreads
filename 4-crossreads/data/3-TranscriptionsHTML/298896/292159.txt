<p>as our crowd lost touch for a while and now we believe he is back on the Hindenburg line. Huge fires are still burning in his lines &amp; most of his dumps &amp; hut camps we now find burnt out. Crossing the Somme was interesting. The bridges (4) had been blown up but we had temporary ones going &amp; gangs were busy constructing permanent ones again. Here we came upon five of our tanks lost in the March April retreat, all had apparently been too late to get across the river &amp; one had been blown in half. Very little material was left behind in this part except at gun positions, he having had time to either remove or destroy most of it. One of his Gothas was near the road having been destroyed recently. As we were digging in for the night he put 5 shells over near &amp; a piece from one wounded one of my A section chaps, not seriously but he was evacuated. Men coming back from leave had a long walk to catch up to their units, anything up to 20 miles &amp; all along</p>
