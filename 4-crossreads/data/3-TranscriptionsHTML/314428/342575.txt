<p>The concert tonight was poorly attended most of the diggers preferring to walk about the streets. Until today the hotels were closed when the soldiers were ashore, but they were open for a few hours tonight &ndash; with the inevitable result &ndash; drunken soldiers &amp; sailers.

All the slavish and menial work is done by the blacks, such as coal lumping, road making etc. Some of the blacks have good jobs such as driving horses, mules and motor cars, etc.</p>
