<p>(23)<br/>(Written 17.12.1917 at Lestrade, a very small village about four</p>
<p>Tuesday 23 November 1916<br/>This is a memorable day in many lives, including that of your  humble servant. For on this day we left Eng for the front. Reveille was at 3.45 am breakfast 4.30 and the "Fall in" sounded at 5.45. no one was absent .</p>
<p>At 6 am. we moved off and marched the three miles to Amesbury Stn. With our "packs up". It was fortunately a nice cool morning. By about 7.30 we had entrained with all our transport horses and wagons. We were not delayed long and by 9am had made a quiet train trip through Southampton down to the docks where we disentrained and unloaded our packed wagon onto a covered shed by the wharves. We were then marched to another covered wharf and here in company with a large number of our infantry , and some men returning from leave, we spent the remainder of the day.</p>
