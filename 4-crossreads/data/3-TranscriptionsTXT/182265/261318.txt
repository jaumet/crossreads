A.I.F.
Entry 18/5/17 We train here reinforcements for the 4th Brigade - 13th,14th, 15th, 16th. Bns. as they arrive from Australia. The Training ground is on a hill near the camp - called "The Pimple" by the men.
The ususal route march (taking place twice a week) is from the Camp through Steeple Langford, Hanging Langford and Wylye.
Today we had an all-day route march and field operations between Wylye and Noyle - marching altogether about 15 miles, our Bagpiper Band marching all the way. Our Brass Band met us near Wylye coming home.
I started a Debating Society in the Camp last night. About 400 to 500 men, NCOs & Officers attended & a very interesting Debate took place,
