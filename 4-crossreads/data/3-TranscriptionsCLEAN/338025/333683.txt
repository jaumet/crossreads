  
 Thursday 10th May 1917 Bapaume Harnessed up team and left park at 8am. Went to Dump at Vaux for a load of empty shell cases. While waiting there Fritz started shelling. Arrived back in camp about 11am. Went for another load in the afternoon and left them beside the railway line which runs alongside out camp.
