I was back at the Base, as a Hospital case,an' was booked through to Blighty again.
We landed all right on a wet gloomy nightBut what did I care for the rain,When a Red Cross bloke fixed me up with a smoke,an' a crib on the Red Cross train.
So that's how I'm here feeling shaky an' queerIn this clinking Red Cross bed,With a Red Cross Nurse, when I'm feeling worseTo lay cool things on my head.An all of it seemed to be part of my dreams,Yet I know that it's not been a hoax.For there's thousands today who are ready to sayThank God for the Red Cross blokes.
Verse By L. Graham, H. Morton Smith
Gone - but he with us lives,Link'd in our strife,Link'd with the life that givesThe Hero - life.
