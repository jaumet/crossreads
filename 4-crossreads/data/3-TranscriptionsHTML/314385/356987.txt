<p>Tues Oct 3rd<br/>Nothing doing in particular.</p>
<p>All the wards are full of patients some with trench feet. This is brought on by constant standing in the wet trenches, the feet swell up like cushions &amp; blue spots appear on them and the complaint comes back. Every winter they are treated by being rubbed with oil &amp; linament and wrapped in wadding which gives releif.</p>
<p>Wed Oct 4th<br/>A Soccer match was played on our grounds to day. This is a perfectly round football witch must not be touched with the hands as in the Association game.</p>
<p>Thur Oct 5th<br/>Rain is falling and the ground very sloppy.</p>
<p>A rugby match was played here this afternoon.</p>
<p>I went to a show in Popge this evening given by a Perriot Coy of Tommies from one of the English regiments. The entertainment was excellent.</p>
