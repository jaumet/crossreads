<p>I say old sport, most of us are fearfully short of tobacco &amp; matches &ndash; somehow[indecipherable] &ndash; could you persuade the Col to send along say &pound;25 worth of tobacco (say Havelock) &amp; say &frac12; a packet of matches per man<br/>We are (the Regt) reduced down to about 300 now. ( Why cant we get some reinforcements. You don't know &amp; none of you over there either) We also want envelopes &amp; paper very badly. Will write you fully when I get [indecipherable] to post paper. When you write enclose envelope &amp; paper for reply. I hear on good authority that during the Turkish bombardment yesterday the Colonel of 8th was wounded.</p>
