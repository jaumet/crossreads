1917 Thursday 26 April 
Up for breakfast at 8 a.m. tis hard to take (?) Duties for an hour, clean up free for rest of day. Over to Y.M. C A for cup of cocoa to write this letters. Write all afternoon read.
After tea, A.Carruthers, Bert. R. "Johno" Ridgy self walk over to Thiepval view the ruins massive German defences --- truly the taking of that post was a magnificent piece of work for the British troops. Such a wilderness of shell holes wreckage. Thiepval Chateau all that's left of it, a few bricks, underground passages, Tank, dead Fritzes, Duds. Ugh! such grusome sights, make very little impression after all these months. Life's held very cheaply.
