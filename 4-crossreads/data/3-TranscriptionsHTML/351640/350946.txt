<p>run.   Once being launched into a fight to win is the great desideratum because then the winner can dictate terms to the vanquished.  Vas victis is as true to day as ever.   One does not care to think what will be the fate of Europe under Teuton domination.  However we must strain every nerve to diminish the ill effects upon our Empire.  If our fleet is as good as we have long believed it to be then it is upon them we must rely in the end.  No one can see clearly what may eventuate during the next twelve months, and one does not like to give free vent to his thoughts, they might run riot with his wishes, and he might be thought to be a Jonah.  However let us have patience.   Large numbers of men are being sent from here to the fighting area in Turkey, almost each day.  To night several thousands of Territorials were upon the Cairo Ry. station entraining for the front.  The wounded come back in train loads, this shows that the Turks are not inactive.</p>
<p>I must to bed.   Good night.   Good night.   Good night.</p>
<p>8.8.15 or rather 9.8.15.   Bruce MacLaughlan [McLachlan] called to see me this morning, he stayed to lunch, then went to the pyramids, he looked very well &amp; has promised to come tomorrow evening, or rather this evening, and to bring Ted Norrie with him, they can then tell me about their experiences in New Guinea and Rabaul.   We talked about you and home.  This is a long way from home.</p>
<p>What will you think of the news to hand today?   The fall of Warsaw and the taking of Riga, the former a city of one million inhabitants, the latter the greatest sea port in Russia.   The Russians never have been any good against a civilised foe, only against Tartars and other semi civilised fighters.  The outlook for the present is real bad for us.   German Bill did not take long to find a king for Poland, it is announced to night that one of the Austrian Grand Dukes is to be made king.   All hail the conquering hero and woe to the conquered.  Such has been the way all adown the ages.</p>
<p>You will find enclosed some material that may be of interest to you.  A few samples of the leaves from the Virgins tree, they may be powder by the time of arrival in Sydney, if not so much the better, I managed to get one of the Arabs to climb the sloping trunk and pull them, some go in Mollies envelope.  Three small pieces said to have been cut from the olive trees growing in the garden at Gethsemanai n they were given to me by the Prioress of the Convent of the African Mission at Zeitoun.  Please purchase a book of views of Sydney and post to her:&ndash; The Prioress, Convent of the African Mission, Zeitoun, Egypt.   She is a dear lady who has been of great service to the Australian and New Zealand soldiers camped near to her home, the sisters having given to her worthy assistance.   God bless them.  An agnus Dei also,</p>
