<p>74 October 15th<br/>General meeting held today when Lewis presided. He said that after 2 months hard work with the Germans, working in with them for the benefit of all officers, the Commdt on his return from leave, has frustrated all his plans &ndash; So Lewis has decided not to have any further transactions with the Hun &amp; is going to do his utmost to annoy them. If he has the Confidence of we Eng Officers &ndash; He cannot see why we should be prepared to work in with the Hun &amp; receive nothing in return.</p>
<p>The Commdt is greatly disliked. He will not allow officers to carry sticks on walks &ndash; he will not permit any paper or pictures larger than size of a PC posted on wall after several marks worth of paper had been purchased at canteen &ndash;</p>
<p>This afternoon numerous officers were playing Rounders &amp; making a most awful noise, just to annoy the Commdt. It had the desired effect, because He &amp; the adjt soon appeared, furious as I have ever seen a hun, &amp; convened a special roll call. He said there was too much noise &amp; cancelled our walk for 1 day &ndash; after roll call, Lewis &amp; the Germans had a conference, when the former explained in very few words our grievances &amp;c, so the Commdt, having wind up crawled down the ladder &amp; said that He would write to Karlsruhe,</p>
