<p>Saturday 21 June 1919<br/>Real bonny day today. Went for a ride on the bikes. Did some printing of photos. Went over to Greenock in the afternoon &amp; met John. We ate all his strawberries too besides a big tea. He is very nice. Walked to Gourock &amp; got the 8 pm boat there. Quite cold tonight. Mr Stewart &amp; Willy home for the weekend. Looks like rain.</p>
<p>Sunday 22 June 1919<br/>Rain again. Wrote home &amp; to Hadfields re Mr [indecipherable] letter. Janet packed. Had the wind up ill this morning. Talked father after tea if I could have Janet. Caused some amusement to the family who were in the kitchen. Everybody was tickled to death. Rained all day. Only able to go for a walk for about an hour.<br/>Fritz scuttled his 70 boats in Scapa Flow. Caused some sensation too.</p>
