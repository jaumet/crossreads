  
 probably only lead to much the same slaughter as the Turks suffered when making their last effort to which I have referred. The position is held by five Brigades and will not hold another man, being already overcrowded. We cannot develop a wide front along the low ground towards the south as long as the enemy holds the small promontory of Gaba Tepe, which has been transformed into a regular fortress and which has defied all our efforts in spite of the terrific fire to which it has been subjected by the Fleet. The position at Anzac is, therefore, a complete stale-mate.
