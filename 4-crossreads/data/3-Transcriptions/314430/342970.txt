<p>England Again and Coming Home</p>
<p>Part IV</p>
<p>October 7th :- Got my first glimpse of Old England again at 8 a.m. this day at which hour we saw the coastline of the Isle of Wight. The morning was bright. The sun danced on the sea. How joyous are my thoughts <strike>this</strike> today! What a sense of relief to be out of the terrible drama on the Western front! My mind seems, as it were bruised by the forceful effects of the great Conflict, and I am not yet able to <strike>compreh</strike> realise the fact that I am bound for a land of peace, that I am <strike>not</strike> really out of the strife. I seem to doubt it. Perhaps, the sense of relief is too great and <strike>po</strike> overpowering to allow my <strike>mind</strike> mentation to operate its proper poise. We are all, more or less in the same dreamy state. <strike>We</strike> Reached Southampton about 10 a.m., and <strike>were</strike>conveyed by train to Devonport. The train stopped at Exeter where the ladies of the Red Cross Society in the Old English city, met us with beautiful refreshments and lovely tea. What happiness! How <strike>greatf</strike> grateful we all felt <strike>to</strike> for the thoughtfulness and kindness. To each man some of the ladies distributed a specially prepared postcard* which <strike>they</strike> could quickly be filled in. These were then collected by ladies who stamped and posted them.</p>
<p>* Appendix 14 was the card I received and filled in.</p>
