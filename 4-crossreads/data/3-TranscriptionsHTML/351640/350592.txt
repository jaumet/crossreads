<p>at Sakkarah (I may have done so in a former letter, the one about the museum).  It will bear rewriting.  The Romans some 2000 years ago removed some of them.  The Curator of the Museum in Cairo told me last Sunday that he knew of the existence of but two of them, which are today in New York.  When Mr Roosefelt [Roosevelt] was here, a few years back, he asked the Curator the same question, and when he received like reply he nearly fell back against the wall &amp; said:&ndash; "When I return to America I must look into the matter of have it made known that such material is in our own country".</p>
<p>Dr Purchas of Auckland, a major here with the New Zealanders, with his wife and a niece had morning tea with me this morning.  He &amp; his ladies look well and they are enjoying Egypt.</p>
<p>I enclose you a receipted account for odds &amp; ends which has at the head a picture of Mena House before the gum trees grew.  The pyramids Kheops &amp; Kephren are well shown in the back-ground.</p>
<p>The pyramids are but tombs which began in modest form thousands and thousands of years agone, grew bigger &amp; bigger as each following potentate desired to go one better than the rulers before him.  From a simple heap of stones they reached a climax when Kheops or Cheops made the larger of the two reach into the atmosphere more than 450 feet.  Truly a gigantic flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Tata for the present.  May tomorrow add to these pages, and then give them to the post office.</p>
