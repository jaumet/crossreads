<p>WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; cold. Knocking round</p>
<p>in the morning, and went</p>
<p>out to the rugby match</p>
<p>Australia V South Africa in</p>
<p>the afternoon. It was a fair</p>
<p>match &amp; we won by 9 - 8 &amp; were</p>
<p>very lucky to do so. Stayed</p>
<p>at the flat all the evening.</p>
