We practice our Signalling on the Sun deck, &amp; have a very nice time of it.<br/>Thursday 23rd 15<br/>Still in the Indian Ocean, expect to sight land to morrow. Yesterday we had a funeral so had the opportunity of witnessing a burial at sea, it was very impressive<br/>Thursday 25th<br/>We are now in the Red Sea<br/>passed through Hells Gate this morning.<br/>Yesterday we sighted land for the first time since leaving Albany, &amp; [saw?] what appeared to be a small island in the distance.<br/>This morning we saw plenty of land on Arabian &amp; African coasts.<br/>After being away from land for so long, a great deal of interest was aroused.<br/>The sea is now a dark green color. Both coast lines are hilly. Yesterday again we saw ships for the first time since Albany, this morning we have seen several already.</p>
