11 had 2 full Corporals, let me see he said? Sergt Price is away on leave Corporal Barwick can't do much with his bad foot, at this we nearly burst out laughing for it is a standing joke in the Coy. the way Len works his foot, gets the officers sympathy at the same time "oh he is an artful dodger is Len, yesterday he was "Orderly Corporal" he got the Capts permission to go to Dernancourt get some footballs from the Comforts Fund so he gets a bicycle away he goes, gets as far as Beauveaux learns there that he can catch a car there in the morning, so he decides to come back pitch a yarn about the bicycle breaking down etc tells Mr Edgeley about the car, so today Mr Edgeley gave him another "pass" for Dernancourt there you are.
