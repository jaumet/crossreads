<p>France<br/>1.5.1917<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>Your several letters (Fathers of 26th Feb &amp; 4th March Mothers of 5th March) reached me yesterday. Ted forwarded them on to me &ndash; Am thankful to hear you are both keeping well, also the Brother &ndash; He is certainly on the right track with the Army life. Ted sent me a copy of his (Pat's) examination paper. It was a very solid test to give a man recently joined. I doubt if many of the officers here would be able to pass such a test.</p>
<p>Am answering the above letters together as we go back into action tonight and I have a fair amount to see</p>
