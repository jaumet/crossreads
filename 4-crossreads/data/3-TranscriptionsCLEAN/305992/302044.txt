  
 Shipped a large quantity of bacon in cases for Egypt for the Allied troops. Same sent off in lighters cases partly submerged in salt water. A shameful method of spoiling good food. Reported same to the authorities, Government Property, & as per usual no one seems to care. A private firm would not tolerate such poor management. The amount of waiste is awful in foodstuffs & hard material. Two naval signalmen on board & all officers having a good & through practice at Semephore & Morse, the same being very necessary whilst in a troopship. Good news received daily re the Western front, the best news & advance since the commencement of the war. 
 29.8.18 This morning whilst some hydroplanes were up flying one broke down & fell into the harbor a few feet from our ship & capsized. Motor boats & a tug went to the rescue & managed to save the pilot & observer without much injury beyond a wetting. 
 30.8.18 Wittnessed some torpedoing practise 11/2 mile targets. The tracks were not very visible & very fair shots. 
 1.9.18 Sailed all around the harbor amongst the dreadnoughts, cruisers, torpedoe boats & all classes of ships of war.
