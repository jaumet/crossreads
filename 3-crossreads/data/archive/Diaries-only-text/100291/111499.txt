1917 Tuesday 13 Feb.
Nothing of import happens during day.
Duty as usual at 8 p.m. Hayman my relief has developed a boil on his neck. They are very prevalent due to lack of vegetables. "Chats" have us in their power. The dugouts are alive with them we cannot get a change of clothes.
A Fritz aeroplane brought down one of our this afternoon about a mile away. Both our chaps were of course killed. Some of his planes are faster than ours.
