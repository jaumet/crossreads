  
 19 August 1918 Monday Through Jerusalem & Bethany by moonlight once more-   I think the Holy places look their best when all is quiet at night. Camp 3 miles out fed & slept till 3 AM then rode on downhill all the way in a haze of dust to Talat Dumm which I told you of before & means Hill of Blood owing to color of the soil-  Jim Ayre is here, & going strong tho' hands bad with Septics.  We often yarn about Riverina as we eat your Sweets together
