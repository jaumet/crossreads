<p>My dear Mother,<br/>Enclosed are some pretty good photographs I got from a chap last night; the first one of the Egyptian ladies is taken in Cairo of course but the others are all taken round here and will give you a good idea of the camps and the class of country.<br/>I was very pleased to get some photos of home from Hal &ndash; You do all look toffy with the car; what an imprssion you must have created in Ulan when you were sailing through to the picnic at Reedy Creek.<br/>I don't think the paper the boys used was too good as the photos were a bit blurry, especially the one of the young rams, but some of the others were very good and you dont know how pleased I am to have them. Of the cards I am sending you, the fifth one is our camp and the place where I keep my horse is the left hand end of the back line in the middle; our tent is not there as it was taken before we came I think.<br/>Your parcel has not come yet but am still watching for it. I only wrote to you a couple of days ago.<br/>Love to Father and lots to your self Mother dear.<br/>I am<br/>Your loving son<br/>Robert C. Wilson.</p>
