Thurs 18thI was on duty from 3 oclock till 8 this morning & had a very cold shift despite the fact that I had plenty of warm clothes on: After I had breakfast I went to Army Corps Head Quarters & put the day in with Rowling; A Turk gave himself up to-day & all his cartridges had the ends cut off. he said it was a general order for them to cut the bullets; 3 others came in a couple of nights ago & said they had plenty of men & ammunition but no overcoats or boots to supply the troops & if they had much wet weather a large number will have to surrender, they also said they are short of sugar & salt but have plenty of biscuits; Anzac came in for its usual amount of shelling today - otherwise everything quiet enough
