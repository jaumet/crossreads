for bombs have a nasty habit of hurting and killing and I'm too young to die.Sept.20th My Australian leave has come through so I'm off and will not be back till March next year. Still I'll be willing to come back if I can have a month or so in Aussie for it seems Centuries since I saw dear old Sydney. Left Vraignes per boat for nucleus at Perrone to await craft leaving for Australia. Fritz was over during the night  giving us a send off with bombs but he got no prizes.On 24th we marched out of the Nucleus and arrived at Bray about 4pm.
