<p>The desert mocked at Time's Remorse,<br/>While months waxed into years.<br/>Who knows the strain that breaks the heart?<br/>With grief and loss and fears.<br/>The past has aged boys into men<br/>-And red war ages most &ndash;<br/> <u>While conscripts cavil at sacrifice<br/>To duty's unlaid ghost.</u></p>
<p>There's a heavy hearted laddie,<br/>Weary and worn to-day,<br/>Now in his third year battle<br/>Biding the grim fate's sway.</p>
<p>Alf P.K. Morris<br/>MED Sergt. 12th A.L.H.</p>
<p>Sinai Desert, 1/9/16<br/>On Reading Anti-conscription speech in Melbourne.</p>
