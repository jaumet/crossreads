to be 3 of our Planes were over the top of 1 of Fritz's & they were forcing Fritz down gradually the kept closing down on him & preventing him from escapeing, gradually Fritz was forced down by a bit of wonderful work of our Aeroplanes, after a while they were out of our gaze owing to the Trees & I learnt from one of our Train Guards that he was brought to earth & taken prisoner & his Aeroplane was taken charge of by an Officer.Wednesday 18/7/17.About 12 noon one of our Aeroplanes which belonged to another Aerodrome ran short of Petrol & they made for the Aerodrome behind our Camp about 2 mile off they volplaned down from a great height gradually & struck a Hop Field with the result that the Machine fell from a height of about 12 feet & the Propellor jambed into the ground & broke the Blades into Pieces, fortunately they were not hurt, several of our Boys rushed over to their assistance but it was not required anyhow one got a piece of Blade as a momento & intends making the piece into a Cribbage Board.
