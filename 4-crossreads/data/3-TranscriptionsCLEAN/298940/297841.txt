Thursday 14th Feb. 18Yesterday the boys of D'Arcy Dixon's group of religious enthusiasts had a bible class in his little barber's shop where we sleep. I participated. Gray & Vic Hall and among others, were there.This afternoon I played two games of chess - one with Rickson a religious & rather bigoted man  who is particularly narrow minded on the question of cigarettes & the rum issue -- & the other with Strange. Both games I lost, but I gained some experience, & I fancy I shall be quite fascinated with the game.
