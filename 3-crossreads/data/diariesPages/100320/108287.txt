8/12/18 Paris
where I left the nurses. To hotel. the Place del'Opera and Rue de la Paix very crowded. Had a rest in the hotel wrote and read up the story of Faust for tonight. Went to the Opera after dinner hurriedly taken at Arrigonis. Arrived just in time and had a seat between two French girls and a civilian. Close up to the orchestra and a splendid position. "Faust" was rendered splendidly and an excellent ballet was also included in the bill. Between acts walked down into the foyer which brilliantly illuminated is a very fine hall. Everyone who is anyone walking up and down here. The concluding scene of Faust was much differently staged to the representation I saw at Florence. The interior decorations woodwork carving etc. of the Opera pass description. Returned to the hotel just before midnight.
