Saturday July 7thJob very quiet in store. The lads under 19 pest us now & again for changes, there is pracitally nothing in the store, so we have the same old storey to tell them "nothing doing". There was a draft of men go to Lark Hill this morning, so every A.M.C man in camp now is put on fatigues.
Sunday July 8thToo busy to go to church parade this morning, so I went down to a service in the Y.M.C.A. this afternoon. We very seldom have to work on a Sunday afternoon, unless there is a draft going out or coming in.
Monday July 9thPut in for leave to go to London, this morning. Was recommended by the Quarter Master. I put in for 48 hrs from 11 to 13th July. Not feeling too well today. Was classified this morning & marked B2A. (6 months in England) & recommended for a board to see if I am permantly unfit for further field service. One thing I do not want to go back to France. Weighed myself today, have lost seven pounds since coming from Perham Downs camp.
