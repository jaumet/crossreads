<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>Your letter of 16/12/17 I am now about to answer.  It is Saturday night.  Ellis has gone to the theatre but I've 20 letters to answer &amp; the show "Under two Flags" by Ouida is not my style so I stayed at Home.  I've another job now as well as my usual work.  I've to go &amp; sleep in one of the Barrack Rooms to see that it is cleaned etc. &amp; that Lights Out is obeyed &amp; generally manage the Hut.  It is a beastly job but Duty is Duty.  I'll not be sleeping with Ellis now for 3 months but of course I'll have the usual comforts &amp; will only sleep in the other place.  A fellow can sleep anywhere so it is of no</p>
