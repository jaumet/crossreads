<p>Dear Mr Robertson</p>
<p>Just a few lines to let you know what part of the world I am in. I also have to thank you for your great kindness in cabling to Mr. George of the "Australian Book Co". Well it was bad luck, for I had just finished my furlough, 14 days, when I received a letter from him. He wanted me to come &amp; stay for a couple of weeks, but on account of some men deserting, the Authorities would not grant me a further furlough. I promised, though, that I would come one week-end. that also was hit in the head. Anyhow, I was one of the men picked for Lord Mayor's Day, to march through London, but as we had to tramp all day in the wet it was no good going up to see him.<br/>Well, Mr. Robertson, to-morrow I am off to the Dardanelles again, to do a bit more, so if I get out of this lot, I shall be very lucky. During my stay in London I went to Essex for a week and lived with the Hon. Mrs Ives, who treated me like a son instead of a plain soldier.<br/>Well Mr. Robertson I am an awful letter</p>
