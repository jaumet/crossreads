You go to bed at nightAnd when to sink in blissful sleepThe weary Billjim triesThe mournful Jackal rends the nightWith cries, and cries, and cries
4And Spiders, lizards, snakes and antsWhere ere you chance to roamAll claim a vested interested inThe place you call your home.And dust and sand and heat conspireTo make these "Holy" shoresA grim, vast, septic HospitalOf sores, and sores, and sores
5The Holy land's a golden placeTo read about in booksBut Billjim covered in its grimeJust sees it as it looksThere ain't no milk and honeyCorn and wine is out of dateAnd time here only stirs the chordsOf hate, and hate, and hate
LM  23-7-17Beni Selah
"Exiled from Home"In the cool and dewy morningWhen beneath the slanting rayOf the yellow orbs uprisingSprings to birth a golden dayFrom the dewy Eastern splendourHow our memories, sweetly tenderTurn our fancy to the Southland far away
[Four alternative lines (indecipherable) written over the above]
2In the brilliant noonday gloryWith the red sky all ablazeWhen the scorching blinding KamseenComes in whirling drifts of hazeWhile we fume and sweat and swelterVainly seeking some cool shelterOh, its fine to think of Home & better days
3In the evening when the Red sunGlides adown the Western sky
