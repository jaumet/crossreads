<p>[Reverse of above postcard]<br/>Dearest old Frank<br/>I was so glad to get your two letters yesterday and am sorry one of the little goats died but hope the others are all right. Just fancy you dreaming I was shot in the foot, just about the time I was shot too, and altho' it was not in the foot, it is the foot that stops me from walking.</p>
<p>Won't you be glad when Dad comes marching (I mean limping) home in 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 months? Goodbye little boy. Lots of love from Dad</p>
