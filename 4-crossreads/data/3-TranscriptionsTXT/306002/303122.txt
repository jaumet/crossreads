26.4.15Mon. 26th.  This morning half of us led the horses out for exercise, while the others cleaned up the lines.  No parade after dinner & we had time enough to slip down & have our farewell bath in Helouan.  Stables at 3.30, then tea, & had to be ready to leave Helouan at 6 oclock.  It was just dark when we marched by the Tewfik Palace Hotel, & were soon on the road to Maadi.  The night was cool & the moon came out shortly after we started, but I was too sleepy to enjoy the ride, & was glad when we arrived at Maadi at midnight & were asleep within half an hour, & rather hungry to be comfortable.
