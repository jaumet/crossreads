 4 Thursday 
 Got up &amp; sat sewing in wind under trees &ndash; then Oh Lord the pain.  Caught cold in tissues.  Crept to bed at 3.30.  In fearful pain so that I couldn't move &amp; sister Earl left me till Dr. came round at night.  Suffered all night.  Sheila and Webber insufferably noisy &amp; vulgar.  Sister Davis out of tent so it was like a hyena cage.
