<p>Thursday 25 July<br/>Wonderfully quiet.  Have not heard a shell apart from the Archies.</p>
<p>Friday 26 July<br/>Last night a platoon of this battalion were to take a strong post led by one of our officers.  They failed &amp; the only casualties were two Australians, both killed, the officer &amp; a Corporal.  Something fishy about it.  Very quiet. Change over to-night for the Battn. in the line.</p>
