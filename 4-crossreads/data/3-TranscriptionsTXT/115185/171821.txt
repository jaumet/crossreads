6 - at the New Century Club. The girls have heard from Gibson since I did. He thought I left last Monday.They will let me know all about him now. They are very keen on going to Manchester to see him but I don't think as he is not very ill. It is worth the expense.It's pouring rain. I am going to get my high tea for 1/- at a charming tea shop in Museum St. with one of the sisters. Ida [indecipherable]'s friend Miss Blundell much love my heavenly & adorable parents. I hope you are both well and long to be home. I don't want to stay in England. It's too sad - your loving daughter
