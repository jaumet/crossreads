<p>crawlers &amp; muldoons who are hanging round the Kitchen serving out the tucker &amp; etc, they are all Tommies &amp; a lovely crowd, never seen such boys in my life, they were trying to do us "Aussies" out of sugar in our tea so as they could have all the more for themselves, but they came at the wrong sort, we all told them off &amp; old Beggs in particular shook them up a treat, so now we are all looking out for a hot time.</p>
<p>29th. Rilen &amp; I went out to the dentist again this morning &amp; what a time I had of it, bored into my head jerked one nerve out &amp; put some chemical in to kill the other one as he said it was too tender, never no more for me after this lot is finished the sweat came out in great drops all over my face the pain was that</p>
