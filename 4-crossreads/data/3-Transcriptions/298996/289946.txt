Mail today Letters from Dad Dick Lillie Ted Forrsberg &amp; mail from Dick we had papers to burn here, our chance of being relieved for a spell looks very rosy 25 Battalion had come to our positions, they are a fine lot of men, Queenslanders, to boot. It looks very much like rain here, which I expect we shall have by tonight. Rations today Bread &frac12; Loaf, small Soap. Bacon jam onions, Tea &amp; sugar, mild water plentiful. We had a few 25 men mingled with us in the trenches to instruct them about different things. Kangaroo Australia day.</p>

We were told that our trip to Limnos Island was postponed endyosly but later <strike>were</strike> were told to pack up as soon as we were relieved from the trenches. How joyful the Boys are. Rations Bacon Bread &amp; jam tea sugar &amp; flour.</p>

We found a horse punt which must have or ranks which had broken down it moring eventually it cut the rope we were towing it with, seamen get very excited when doing anything.
