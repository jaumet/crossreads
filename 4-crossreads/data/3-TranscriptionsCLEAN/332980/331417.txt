  
 the Road between St Omer & Berguette. I caught the Passenger leaving here at 8.35 & passed through Arques & then the line branches away to the left towards the Fireing line, passing through Wardreques, Aire, Icebergs & then into Berguette, as one leaves Wardresques behind, one soon notices a difference, the Civil Population is less & more Empty houses, a large number of Trenches are made & others in course of making by the Chinese Labour Coy, also post's & Barb Wire in front of the Trenches This is all necessary in case the German's make a big attack any tine, as the Train approaches Berguette, the large Iron Works on your left look very desolate, & some of the Works have been hit by Shells & Bombs, These works are closed & all the Civil Population of the Town has departed for other parts except a few people with their Estaminets, the Town itself is deserted & several houses have been hit & knocked about, & shell holes are here & there, all the Windows are broken also all glass
