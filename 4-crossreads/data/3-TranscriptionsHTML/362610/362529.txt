<p>Thursday 9 Nov. 1916<br/>A simply glorious day, bright &amp; clear with quite a fair amount of warmth in the sun. During the morning there was a breeze but later even this died down. Underfoot the mud was of course atrocious, but the bight sunshine did a world of good in reviving the spirits of the men. Aircraft were of course exceedingly active 2 of ours &amp; 1 of theirs being brought down during the day : the enemy showed quite an unusual amount of boldness &amp; daring. About midday went with the Bde. Major to 4th Br. H.Q. in Delville Wood &amp; on coming home very narrowly escaped a meeting with a 5.9 shell. Full moon &amp; clear night when turning in.</p>
