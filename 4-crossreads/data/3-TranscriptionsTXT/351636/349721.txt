 Dear Mr. Horsfield &ndash; Could you kindly assist Mrs. Nelson wife of a soldier in camp again, after being returned wounded, Mrs. Nelson has been seriously ill &amp; is without means to pay her rent or get food till her military pay comes &amp; until she is strong enough to take a situation &ndash; She is very proud &amp; unwilling to take help which we offered before but now compelled to do so. 
 Yours truly E. H. Bennie.
