  
 Plenty of Bully & Biscuits some jam & cheese. Not a cold night had a fair sleep The march this morning took it out of most of us it was quite hot & the road was bad Traveled slowly all day & left the train / 4 Oclock at Castre & marched about 1 1/2 miles to camp getting there at dusk Put in tents & given an extra blanket. It is flat uninteresting country saw a few shell holes at Hasellboch a fair sized place about 6 miles back. The only real signs
