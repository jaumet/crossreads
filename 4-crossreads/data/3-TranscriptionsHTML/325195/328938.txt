<p>15.9.15<br/>Wed 15th<br/>The Despatch rider came a cropper late yesterday afternoon, the horse he was riding has been hit 7 times before but only slightly &amp; yesterday a bullet entered his chest &amp; brought him down, the snipers were very busy &amp; poured in a  volley as he fell but the rider managed to get off the road &amp; into a sap without being hit, but he lost his despatches &amp; decided to wait until dark to get them as the snipers were making the road too hot to get them in daylight; A party of 25 men &amp; an Officer was sent from this Regt this morning as a body guard to Div Head Quarters  only men who have been here from the start &amp; have not been away sick or wounded were sent. Capt Smith was the Officer in charge; &amp;25 men of the 25th L.H. came here to replace them. Had another shower of rain between 3 &amp; 4 oclock this morning but our 'bivy' turned the rain well a very fine day after 9 oclock when the clouds cleared.</p>
