Dear Mum,Should you ever hear that I am coming Home which may happen now any time, perhaps leaving here in 3 months, 6 months or longer, I want you to let the people mentioned on this paper know about it, so that they will not be writing &amp; sending any more parcels.Mrs PreddeyLone PineForest RdBexley
