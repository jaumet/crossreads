Many flags were flying from the buildings to mark the arrival of the convoy. A very large hotel near the beach is pure white & has several rows of bow windows. On the left is the Governor's residence standing in a cleared space between the tall palms & the forest. It was here, to our utter disgust that Captain Von M&uuml;ller of the Emden was banqueted by the authorities. Cingalees parade the streets in white "nighties" & a black "gamp" which makes a very comical picture. It is very hard to distinguish between male & female Cingalee but if one is working it is safe to assume that it is a female. The females carry baskets of coal to the railway trucks whilst the men sit down & smoke. Quaint old barges move slowly about the transports & "bum-boats" as usual are plentiful. Cingalees row out in their boats & for a trifling sum they do washing that is a credit to some done in our cities. Two Cingalees rowed out amongst the transports but were turned away.
