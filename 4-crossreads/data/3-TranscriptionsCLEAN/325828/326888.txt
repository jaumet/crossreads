My dearest FatherIt is close on a fortnight since I last wrote.  We have been very busy since then & have been moved right away from where  we I last wrote  I am unable to give you any clearer address than above.  I must thank you for your letter of 10th Jany that I received yesterday.  Very glad you got my cable early in the year, & by this you should be getting my letters fairly regularly.Whilst out with the horses a few days ago we came across the remains of 6 or 7 [obliterated by censor.]  Water is none too plentiful here so that a swim the other morning was very acceptable.  I am keeping in good health, but the dust is pretty rotten in clothes, tucker etc.  [Censored]
