  
 horses.  We rode through Albert & up over the old British lines where the troops jumped over in the Somme offensive of 1916.  The Bosch trenches were a couple of hundred yds. distant at the time & had a fine commanding view of the country right to Albert.  We traversed the ground which is marked here & there with the small white cross of "A British Soldier", then a small cemetry & on through tangles of battered barbed wire till we came to a huge mine crater.  This mine was laid by the Germans & was fired when the troops attacked.  The crater is quite 90 feet deep & 150 feet in diameter.  It makes one almost dizzy to look down into its depth.  Away at the bottom is a plot squared off with a cross on it marking the spot where men have been buried.  Close to this place is the spot where the East Surreys went over kicking their footballs.
