<p>&amp; turned in (but was looking around about &frac12; hour finding the tent) &amp; slept like a top.<br/>13/10/17 During the night Fritz shelled the camp but only damaged one tent &ndash; no casualties. One big shell fell 20 yds from our tent &amp; splashed it with mud etc. Got up 8.30am &amp; had good breakfast &amp; have since been trying to dry some of my clothes but almost impossible on account of the rain. A heavy thunderstorm splashed over &amp; heavy hail fell. Very cold all day.</p>
