<p>January 21, 1916 Friday</p>
<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>Went out as a troop this morning &amp; did heaps of troop drill under the SM we had on the whole a rough time too much walking but on the hole had a fairly decent time, finished up with a gallop my mare still retaining her reputation in the afternoon signalling instruction helio etc. I had to go over to the canal to cut rushes for the road which by the way isn't getting on as fast as it might, visited the peanut farm &amp; after scouring round succeeded in getting a feed, after tea lamp practice ensued. I had the fast lamp &amp; Norm the slow got it over about 9.30, arranged an N.C.O's flutter in the shape of a 4 furlong gallop at catch weights. Belcher is running a book on it &amp; up to now I'm favorite at 3 to 1 the race is to be run on Sunday morning at 7.30</p>
<p>January 22, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Another bitterly cold night &amp; as I was C of Pic you may be sure I'd get trouble with the horses, feed up at 7.15, at 9 am I was warned to go with two men on patrol duty along the line &amp; took plans with us we started at 9.30 passing at 11 a place called Kattar a sort of wayside inn, the track was very suitable for motors patchy in very few places &amp; then only for a few yards off again and at 12.35 we came to a place called Beressh about 15 miles from Wardan, had dinner there, watered &amp; feed the horses &amp; had an hours rest saddled up &amp; went still further on passing through a grove of gum trees turned at 3.10 for home being then 26 kilometres from camp at an easy pace back as the race is for tomorrow &amp; arrived at 5.40 to find 4 letters awaiting me from home.</p>
<p>Bed 10 pm</p>
