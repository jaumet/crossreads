  
 I doubt the resisting power of any earthwork or redoubt against these heavy shells.  They plough huge craters in the ground & their size may be judged by the fact that  one of  the base of one wh was fired last night could have covered a large dinner plate with ease.  And they stand 31/2 feet high.

 Gen. Godley, accompanied by Lieut-Col Heaton Rhodes returns from Mudros. 
 The weather continues warm, but rain is again threatening. 
 There has been a heavy naval bombardment today of an enemy encampment in direction of Kilid Bair.  The roar of the gun has rent the air all day & the incessant concussion has been of nerve-racking effect.  The health of the troops is improving.

The shells owing to the roar of the wind could not be heard till right upon us & we could not place their direction.  The first was beautifully timed - it came with a deafening whizz, glanced off the back wall of the cook house & went clean through one of the escort's dug-outs as if it were made of tissue paper.  It came to a dead-end half a dozen yds above the General's quarters.  A second shell planted itself near the wireless pole & a third tore a crater in the earth at the mouth of the gully near the Indian Camp.  And then followed a fusillade of two or three shells a minute.  The strong & cantankerous wind planted them in all sorts of odd  places  & interesting places but fortunately no one was injured.  An Indian gunner received a slight chest bruise from a shell planted
