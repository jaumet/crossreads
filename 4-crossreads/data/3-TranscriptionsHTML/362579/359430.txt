<p>&nbsp;<br/>heard from him since that Field P.Card he sent on 19th Sept. I do wish this war was over, one hates to think of the poor boys in the cold   &amp;  wet.</p>
<p>alice you say it will be lovely to see Paris, well I'm thinking it will not be for everso long.</p>
<p>Pleased to hear Mrs Copp is better. Also that Mother remembered Lucie's birthday. I sent her a P.Card but think that mail went down.</p>
<p>Hope Eddy's cold is better</p>
