Sunday 22nd 1917
While standing there our aeroplanes were flying over our heads, observing and Fritz was sending shrapnel at them so we had a warm time. After discharging our load of bombs at Noreuil and returning through Death trap gully Fritz started to send shrapnel over so we got out of there as quick as possible. Got back to camp about 2.30pm all safe.
