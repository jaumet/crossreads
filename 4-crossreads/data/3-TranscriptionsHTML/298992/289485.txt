<p>tell you where we are going, but I daresay you can guess. Having a lovely trip, quite calm and nice and cool after all the hot months on the desert in Egypt. I don't think any tears are shed on account of leaving Egypt, and I for one was jolly glad to be going away. We have to wear our life belts all day long wherever we go, in case we should hit a "tin fish" but I don't think there is much fear of that. We are on a fine large boat, and have fairly comfortable quarters. Tell Hazel to write to me soon, with heaps of love to you all.</p>
