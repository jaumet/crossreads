<p>29.3.15<br/>Mon. 29th.  No parade this morning, as we received the morning off to clean our gear, for an inspection by Sir Ian Hamilton.  Idleboy lost a shoe last Friday, so I took him to the smiths, &amp; had him shod, which took up nearly the whole morning;  we had dinner at twelve, &amp; filed out at 12.30, &amp; marched to the same place as we were inspected at last Monday.  We only marched by Sir Ian H. once, &amp; it was quite enough, as the dust was dreadful, we arrived back in camp at 3.30.  Penny &amp; Butter has gone to town.  I put the night in writing to Edie T.</p>
