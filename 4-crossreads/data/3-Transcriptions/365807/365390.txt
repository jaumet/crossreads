[Hemiplegin?] had improved ie. he could move R. leg and R. arm, but unable to extend wrist (due I thought to a lesion either concussion or anatomical division of the musculo spinal nerve from the bullet wound). He could say a few simple words. We kept him here about 18 days, &amp; he steadily improved the whole time. The musculo spinal paralysis disappeared about the 5th day, so the lesion could only have been due to a concussion of the nerve.</p>
