<p>Wednesday 5 February 1919<br/>Rafa<br/>N.Z.M.R. Brigade Races, busy writing diary.  Cold little better.  Letter from Laura thinking I was in Australia.<br/>Lost money at Races but even so life here is cheaper than Cairo &amp; if the men do gamble better to keep them employed than hankering after the Flesh pots of Egypt &amp; breaking away.</p>
