A peice of cake, half a dozen lollies each & two bottles of sauce & a tin of fruit for the section was our whack.  We got the second dose of Cholera innoculation stuck into us yesterday & to day my arm is a bit sore  This morning I went down to the wells, did a bit of washing & had a bath, thats a good morning's work to my credit
