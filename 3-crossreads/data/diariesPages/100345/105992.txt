very nice nearly 30 being present: Church parade for the mob the band sounded well after not hearing one for some time: Alf I walked along the canal towards Croix du bak the scenery was very nice: I got a "P" of some artillery horses being "watered" also a canal scene: dinner: we had a "eat up? for tea: I went over seen F Poole he has hurt his ankle playing football: we had a good talk: while there sitting under a tree a taube was being shelled overhead a nose cap fell barely five yards away from us: Church at 7.30 pm was very good: B Coy played C Coy football but C. Coy beat our mob: three hospital cases resulted out of it so I pity the Fritz's if we get to proper "holts" with them: seen some anti-aircraft guns on motor lorries; Taubes were over during the day:
