<p>France<br/>22 July 16<br/>Thought you might like to get this now that I am safe.<br/>F.S.P.</p>
<p>My own darling Sisters,</p>
<p>I am writing this on the eve of my going into action. They say there will be something big doing. Please God that "I will do my duty and be a man". (to quote part of what poor old Ralph said when he left Australia)<br/>I have seen Alister Stobo several times, &amp; yesterday he went thru our dressing station suffering a little from the effects of a gas shell which fell in his vicinity. I trust he will be O.K.<br/>Dear old girls! Should anything final happen to me I hope that you will hear that I tried to do my duty. &ndash; and don't grieve over much.<br/>With very much love to you all &ndash; also to Mr Owen &amp; Will<br/>Ever your loving brother,<br/>Fredk S. Phillips.</p>
