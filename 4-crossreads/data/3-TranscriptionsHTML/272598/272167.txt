<p>Tuesday 3.4.17<br/>Glad to see daylight, ground covered with snow, still a lot of casualties coming through.  Had no sleep during night, feeling rather tired.  Fritz brought down a couple of our baloons in flames; a beautiful piece of work amid a hornet's nest of machine guns &amp; anti-aircraft guns.  Two of Fritz's planes brought down earlier in the afternoon.</p>
