 Lovely Day with occasional showers Runs to A.D.M.S. (5th Aust. Div.) at Ypres Again to Ypres   passing Busseboom,     Ouderdom & Vlamertinghe on each occasion      2nd Can. Adv. Medical Stores     14th Field Ambce. (Dickebush) This has been a busy day & the roads were slippery. In Ypres shelling by Fritz was in progress & my second run to this place was very lively.  Assisted to bandage up a wounded man who was hit by piece of shell just about 20 yards in front of me.  Other shells fell round me on the road.
