<p>Several men were shot, and a sniper worried our post badly, <strike>and gave</strike> giving us an anxious time.  I heard later that the Turks disguised themselves with bushes, and painted their faces green;  the New Zealanders captured a woman disguised in that fashion and her lair had enough water and provisions for a month.</p>
<p>Next night found us on a different post, and during the day we were trying to locate a sniper.  I had a pair of field glasses and whilst looking at the hills, noticed what appeared to be an old fort in a ruinous condition.  I made enquiries but nobody knew anything of its history.  A fine view of the surrounding country could be seen from here, and the warships in Suvla Bay were plainly visible.  That night we went sapping along the seashore, and returned in the early morning.  This Argyle Ravine was taken by the New Zealanders after a desperate fight;  the Turks having been in preparation for a couple of months;  the German officers were comfortably situated in tents with bedsteads and had their womenfolk with them.  It is 3 miles from Anzac;  <strike>and</strike> a little distance from the place shown on the map as Fishermen's Hut.  A few miles further on are the Salt Lake and Suvla Bay.  A trench runs the whole way from Anzac to Suvla;  <strike>and</strike> it being wide and deep enough for mules to pass through, <strike>and be</strike> secure from machine gun snipers.</p>
