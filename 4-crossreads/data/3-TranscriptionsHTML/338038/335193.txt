<p>in a most dead &amp; alive hole namely Tel-el-Kebir on the Cairo-Ismalia line, and about 23 miles from the latter town which is of course on the Canal. We lobbed in Tel-el-Kebir at 4 o'clock one morning the 28th Decr I think ( I have quite lost count of days lately) and as there is no settlement nearer than Zagazig 12 miles distant, we were rather put to it for victuals, so that the Christmas cheer came in right at the critical moment &ndash; what a lovely lot of things you sent! They were a perfect treat &ndash;</p>
<p>Our camp at Tel-el-Kebir is practically on the spot where Wolesley fought the great battle in 1882 &ndash; In fact some of the old Schneider bullets and cartridge cases can be picked up even to this day &ndash; The country is just typical desert &ndash; that's all one can say for it. Nothing to be seen for miles &amp; miles but gravelly plains interspersed here and there with belts of verdure &amp; palm groves which mark the courses of the many canals which traverse the country. These canals are really wonderful works &ndash; being deep and wide enough for two native dhows to pass at a time.</p>
<p>I really don't quite know what we are stuck down there for, unless it is to have us handy in case of trouble on the Canal. I am at present on two days leave from Camp and ran up here to have   <strike>an</strike> a change from camp</p>
