<p>time 150 admissions and still many more to come, really it makes one think and wonder what the world will be. Thank God I have always played the game and am proud of it. Now my dear people I really have no news to tell and feel very tired and have tons to do as Harry is gone away.<br/>So I shall now close with fond love to all and hope to see you soon. Tom Posman is at Haufield Hospital at Dartford England, and I hope to see him soon so his dear people need not worry. I shall do all I can for him.<br/> So Au Revoir and kisses for all<br/>Believe me<br/>Yours always the same<br/>Ellis</p>
