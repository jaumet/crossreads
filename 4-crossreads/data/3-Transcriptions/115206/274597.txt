<p>January 1918<br/>Sunday 27</p>
<p>At Beutin<br/>Today has been a glorious day, I went for a walk this morning along a sunlit track bordered by trees on one side and hedges and a stream on the other.<br/>The morning air was frosty and sparkling. I came to an old log straddled across a tree. Here I sat and wrote a long letter home.<br/>&nbsp;We are being paid in all probability tomorrow.</p>
