<p>Got some more letters today, I am in luck.</p>
<p>The dainties out of the parcels are going fast &amp; are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>We do our work on the desert wich is much harder that that round Cairo &amp; all covered with stones.</p>
<p>The country here is very flat looking away towards the canal &amp; all hummocky towards the desert. We get it cold here in the morning but it is lovely &amp; warm later on.</p>
