<p>My foot throbbed a bit for a good many nights &amp; days &ndash; then only when I lay down but it is quite right now.  One day when I was doing some fatigue work in front of the cook house, a little whisker of death plucked me by the sleeve, and buried itself in a clay bank in front of me  It was a bullet passed through my right shirt sleeve but it missed me.  I dug the bullet out and am keeping it as a souvenir  This happened on your birthday  Would you like to hear what a night on patrol is like  I'll copy it out of my diary, but on condition you don't let that paper man print it.  Here goes.</p>
<p>An order has come that no shot, is to be fired on the Peninsula by our men for 48 hours.  The order came out yesterday morning so &ndash; all day long our guns are quiet  No shots rang out from our snipers in answer to the Turks, no machine guns rattled  Now and then the Turks would fire, but no answer being given, their shooting died down.  Yesterday evening about dusk our trench party fell in, with the 2 patrols on the right.  Before leaving our Captain (Harris) told us all to be very careful &amp; viligant, as an attack by the Turks was expected</p>
