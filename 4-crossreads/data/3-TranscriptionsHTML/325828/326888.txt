<p>Somewhere in Egypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 4.4.16<br/>20th Feby 1916</p>
<p>My dearest Father<br/>It is close on a fortnight since I last wrote.  We have been very busy since then &amp; have been moved right away from where  <strike>we</strike> I last wrote  I am unable to give you any clearer address than above.  I must thank you for your letter of 10th Jany that I received yesterday.  Very glad you got my cable early in the year, &amp; by this you should be getting my letters fairly regularly.<br/>Whilst out with the horses a few days ago we came across the remains of 6 or 7 [obliterated by censor.]  Water is none too plentiful here so that a swim the other morning was very acceptable.  I am keeping in good health, but the dust is pretty rotten in clothes, tucker etc.  [Censored]</p>
