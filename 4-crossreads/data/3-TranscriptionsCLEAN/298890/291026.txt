  
 September 1918 1 Sunday Finish, coldish day.  After lunch went to tea with Scott, Russell & Meilch at 216 The Grove thence onto Margaret McMillan at Deptford.  And home at 10'colock and packed for Bognor. 
 2 Monday Left Vic. at 10.10 for M.T. Ladies Home at Bognor arrived about two.  Despatch hole never felt so depress for years & years by atmosphere 
 3 Tuesday Went on beach in forenoon. A terrible institution vain and snobbish paltry to a degree  Terribly Depressed 
 4 Wednesday On Beach again.  Found others as depressed as myself by the pauperism of the place & its petty rules & ill bred matron  Finish day again
