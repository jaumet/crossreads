<p>9th September  Sunday.<br/>Went to Reminghilst to the 54th Australian siege battery. The batteries &amp; infantry are all now concentrating around the Ypres, Messines sector &amp; will be in action in a few days time. The battery are 8in siege Howitzers, six in number &amp; are hauled by caterpillar tractors. They will be placed in position at Lock 8 near Vormizelle &amp; about 5,000 yds from the Bosh lines.  Whilst l was inspecting the battery, a number of Bosh Aeroplanes came over flying at about 7,000 feet. Our anti-aircraft opened on them &amp; they and became the centre of little white puffs of bursting Shrapnel - familiarly called "Archies".   They made off successfully &amp; dropped a number of bombs killing a number of horses.  The Bosh machines are superior to ours in speed &amp; climbing capabilities. A few shells passed over the battery fired by the Bosh at long range.</p>
<p>It was amusing to notice all the men immediately stop work &amp; lustily cheer.</p>
