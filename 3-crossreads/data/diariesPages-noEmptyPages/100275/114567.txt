28th. Last night we left this camp it was a very hot day one of the hottest I have felt in France, we had a good long march but it is more of a pleasure than anything else in France for the country is so beautiful we pass through, all the crops are scarlet blue with poppies a pretty little flower about the same size as a carnation here there we march through an archway of beautiful beach trees that completely shut the sun out it is a most beautiful country. everyone was very tired as we got towards Warloy, here we saw the 4th Brigade they are camped in the village our camp
