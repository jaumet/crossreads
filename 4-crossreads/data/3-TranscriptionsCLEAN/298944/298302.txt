An hour after the concert party business was cleared up I got a meeting of all the known teachers in the unit, & we decided to have discussions in committee on the extension scheme.
Tonight I am working far into the hours to clear up back correspondence. Jack Woodyard, having relieved me of the Arithmetic course, has enabled me to pay more attention my own work & letters in the future.
