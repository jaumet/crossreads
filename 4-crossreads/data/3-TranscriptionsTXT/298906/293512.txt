 Am acting Orderly Sergt for Johnny Nicholson this morning 4 of us went for a good long walk this afternoon as far as Winterbourne Stoke a small little village but very pretty, I love rambling about these old roads &amp; villages, we take our time &amp; spell whenever we feel inclined in the shade of the old trees along the roads or lanes, &amp; the flowers are splendid just now which makes the strolls all the more pleasant. Had our tea in a little cottage before leaving, &amp; we walked quietly back in the cool of the evening, you could see my cubicle now, I have got her fixed up nicely, every day I have fresh flowers on my table for they are very plentiful at present
