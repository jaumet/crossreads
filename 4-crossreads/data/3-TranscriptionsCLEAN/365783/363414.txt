I wish you would go & get all your photos taken again at a good place in London -   a group of you & the three children & each separately.  I would very much like to have recent pictures of you all.   I have just bought a small Kodak, a No. 1 Kodak Junior, the very latest in Kodaks &#163;2.8. in Cairo & a few shillings extra for a case for it - it is a handy size my old camera was too bulky to carry about when in uniform - I wish you would get one of these cameras for yourself - you will have no trouble in learning to manipulate it - & it will be interesting for us to compare our pictures.   I also bought a daylight developing tank in case I happen to be in some place where I can't get the photos developed.   Surely I told you long ago that Winter had departed; about 6 or 7 weeks ago he had a bit of a spree in Cairo, was arrested & kept in detention barracks for 4 or 5 days.   Out here no one knew anything about him.   While he was still in detention an order came for him to report at the Citadel Hospital in Cairo where there is stationed an R.A.M.C. unit - he duly arrived on the scene here with cuts & bruises
