22/2/19 MarcinellePrinting office and other details this morning and then went to BdeH.Q. with James to argue out with the General the question of our band. Rain came on after lunch and after a bit of countermarching nearly everyone was formed up in the square at Marcinelle to hear Billy Hughes deliver a rattling good speech. General Rawlinson was there too and the troops very much liked his oration. At its conclusion there were crowds of people wanting autographs &c. Influenza is very bad hereabouts now and many deaths are occurring. General Robertson goes to leave tomorrow and then to D.H.Q. so the Bde. is mine. Spent a pleasant evening with the doctor opposite and his charming wife.
