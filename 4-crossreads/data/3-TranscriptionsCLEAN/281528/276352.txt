Wandered round to the right and out to our listening post where was old Thomas of "A" Coy.  His hard old criminal face would scare of any Boche I warrant.  A few growls about rations.  Really they are good but Billjim always growls on principal.  Walked out into No Mans Land and saw where Barker was killed.  It was late before we returned back to Bn. H.Q. for a cup of tea & then to bed.
