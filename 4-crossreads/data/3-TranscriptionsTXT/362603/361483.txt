Was sorry to hear that poor old Bucks lost His arm.  I met Frank Sanders, Teddy Sanders the carrier's Son over here.  He was going to write Home &amp; have our names put on the Burwood Roll of Honour. I got Ida Nelson's socks &amp; wrote &amp; thanked Her for Them.  Thanks per post is not very much, but what can we do else.  Well Mum, I must go up to the Artillery Lines now to play the Hymns so will close.  I will try &amp; write to dad after I return at 9.30 pm. I am just feeling O.K. &amp; rode the 12 &frac12; miles to Salisbury up Hill &amp; down dale in 40 minutes on a heavy wet road.  Weight now 10 st 8 lbs. Lots of Love Harry.
