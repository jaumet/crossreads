 22nd June 1916  Another fine &amp; warm day. Mess orderly for day. Full dress parade again. Another huge laugh. I did not get dressed anyhow. Nothing of importance happened. Night hot into the bargain. 
 23rd June 1916  Washing day. Day hot typical weather for Tropics I presume. "Marathon" dropped behind again. Our ship Cruiser &amp; the others slowed down at nightfall for her. 
 24th June 1916  Another day in the Tropics which was hot. Concert held in the afternoon somewhat a success. Auction sale held. Nigger's pups put up Two sold for &pound;2/3/-. Money goes to Mariners fund. 
 25th June 1916  Sunday today. Church Parade held in morning. A very hot day. Went on guard at four oclock as Telephonist. Did not spend a very good time. Passed the Line at early morning hours. 
 26th June 1916  Finished up guard at 4 oclock this afternoon after spending a hot &amp; tiresome day. Our ship behind all day evidently the old craft is feeling the pinch. Is gradually getting up to the other ships tonight. In bed early. 
 27th June 1916  Raining today &amp; very miserable. Otherwise very quite. Our ship still in the rear.
