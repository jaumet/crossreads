<p>Thursday 6 April 1916<br/>Although we did not actually see the sign "Versailles" I believe it was here we had breakfast. In the railway yard a good supply of hot tea had been prepared and made a most welcome addition to our rations. We were all glad to stretch our legs precautions being taken to prevent the men wandering too far away from the train. The engine was now attached to the opposite end of the train and as we continued the journey we shaved and tidied ourselves up, having had word from the O.C. troops that we should reach our destination soon after noon.<br/>Passing out of the thickly populated parts near Paris, open country with scattered villages and cultivated crops are again the rule, but the character of the crops has changed. Grapes are not now to be seen, cereals forming the main crop. Most of the fields are larger than those along the Rhone, and the soil is much poorer. A spiked roller is in use in one field and close by several  women in wooden clogs digging, while a magnificent pair of horses are ploughing in the next field. Horse chestnut trees which in the south were in full leaf are here just commencing to burst into bud, nor are other signs wanting of the season being much later in these higher latitudes. The sentries along the line are more numerous and women working the signals and at other labours are as frequently seen.<br/>Going through Beaufort and Clermont we are soon traversing country which with a thrill we realise had actually been trodden by the Hun invaders. About noon we reach Amiens, a large city on the Somme whose acquaintance we were to more fully make later on. In many of the villages in the outskirts are billeted British tommies who heartily respond to the greetings of our men, the cockney accent is marked in many cases. Every village appears to have its quota and along the roadways are seen field service wagons and limbers transporting rations etc.<br/>Now we pass through a pretty little village just beyond which is a shrine set up in an enclosure of well trimmed trees. Beyond it is a cemetery beautifully kept, in which stands a monument in the form of a miniature gothic cathedral.<br/>Low lying land, swampy in places and rather desolate looking, has on the far side of it a ridge where can be clearly traced a line of grass-grown trenches. In a village close by houses are of a ruined appearance and many of them are sandbagged up, whilst in the vicinity are numbers of shell holes.<br/>Passing through Fontaine, a village in which a group of children are jeering at an effigy of the Kaiser, Abbeville is reached about 2 pm. It is a large town at the mouth of the Somme and an important railway junction. As he comes from a train drawn up at the next platform we get into a conversation with an English Officer in heavy winter warm who had just come down on leave from the line near Arras, and feel that now we are "almost there"</p>
