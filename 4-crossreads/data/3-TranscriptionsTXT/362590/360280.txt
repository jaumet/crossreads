4.Blighty. Haven't heard anything more of Brissenden since he told me he was a sergt in 3rd Div H.Q. Flannery is with the 1st & is very fit. The men like him immensely.
There are a lot of the old 3rd D.C.C.[Division Cyclist Corp]  knocking round & they are all doing well.
Well goodbye for the present, Judge.
Remember me to Mrs Ferguson & Dorothy
Yours very sincerely
John F Mant
