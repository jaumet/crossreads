8.10.15Fri 8thHave been feeling pretty bad all day, a few sprinkles of rain fell this morning & I thought it wise to go back to the 'phone & see nothing could get wet, but it cleared off before dinner. at 2 o'clock I got two men & took them around & introduced them to the phone box, one of them had front enough to jump up on the parapet to shovel some dirt out of his road despite the fact that the Turks trenches are only 350 yards away. Our snipers seem to have the Turks too frightened to show their nose above the parapet now, & all we long for is the Turks to give us the targets we give them; A Turk came in the night before last & gave himself up, he had arranged with his friends a rifle fire signal to be fired during the night if he got through safe & 7 more would come in, our lads fired the signal & 3 more came in next morning at 4.30.
