<p>We took on a pilot, and went into the harbor, mooring to two buoys.  A lot of small boats containing natives after the laundry work made a great dash for the gangway, and got all mixed up in a fine tangle.  It took two sentries with fixed bayonets to clear them off the gangway.  There was a good deal of shipping in the harbor, and a big Dutch liner came in just behind us.  At 10 a.m. we received passes to go ashore till 4 p.m.  We were rowed ashore in small boats.  Then I took a rickshaw and went for an hour's drive (or ride) along a good road near the coast, past the Galle Face Hotel.  Came back then and did some shopping, &amp; there are some large, well run shops in Colombo.  Afterwards went round the fruit markets and bought a large bunch of bananas for 1/-</p>
<p>Afterwards we were taken out for a lovely motor drive by Mr. Bois.  He is an Australian residing in Colombo, and he had a lot of cars hired</p>
