14.9.15Tues 14thWe are having very dull, cloudy weather at present but the rain seems to be hanging off well & the nights are quite chilly & even a little on the cool side during the day time: We had a pay day to-day, I drew  2.0.0 & sent 1.0.0 to Edie for goods we want. One of our aeroplanes flew over us at dinner time & headed South at top pace, another aeroplane was visible a long way to the South & it was generally thought to be a German &were in hopes of seeing a duel but they were soon both lost to sight, our aeroplane soon returned  so probably there was nothing doing. Our Dr has a bomb mania & is always experimenting with them, to-day he has been particularly lively, exploded one in the Latrines to kill the flies, & several in the incinerator, it appears to amuse him as much as crackers do schoolkids. Eveyone here considers him a bit mad.
