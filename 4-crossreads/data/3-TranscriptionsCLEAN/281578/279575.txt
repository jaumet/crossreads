  
 went down through Corbie  & stopped at the Y.M. for a drink of cocoa. Corbie is a lovely town, prettily situated on the Somme, with some very nice buildings, & it is a shame to see it shattered. We walked through Corbie & on through lovely country, the crops all out in, & flowers growing wild in the fields, red poppies among blue & white flowers. The Crops, like the villages have had to be abandoned when Fritz pushed in March. We came finally to a village called Lahoussoye & were told that the 37th Battalion was camped hereabouts, & we are to take their pozzies when they go out. All the directions we got were practically nil, but I suppose being Australians, they thought we had plenty of savvy & could find the place. Nearly every soldier we asked on the road, belonging to other Australian divisions, hadn't the slightest idea, but at least we found them. A, B, C & D Coys were spread all over the  compass. Merrett & I went to C & D, & the two for A & B left us a mile further back. I got there at 3.30, went to the cook-house; & had a bonza feed, roast rabbit & potatoes. I don't know when I last tasted roast spuds. I had a chat to the 37th chaps, & then looked up the company sergeant major, he showed me round the pozzies. It is a lovely spot here tall green
