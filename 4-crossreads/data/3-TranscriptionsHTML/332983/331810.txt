I said don't you think that there is another way to do it, he said no, well I said I do, with that I explained my way. I also said it is a nice thing sending horses over here for me to correct other peoples mistakes. He nearly went mad. It was the 1st Bty that shod him last, and that is the Battery he holds up as a model. However I done him my way. He knows as much about shoeing as a pig does about a side pocket. I did not forget to tell him that I have been shoeing these horses twelve months, and never had a horse pricked. When a man will tell you to lower the heels, and cut the foot down, and it will not matter if you draw the blood, well all I can say is that he is a real waster. The farrier of 3rd Bty, Bill Quelch cant get on with him at all, and to make matters worse he is camped at 3rd Btys wagon line<br/>5/10/1915<br/>Today is a beautiful day. Without doubt we are having lovely weather. A bit of shooting from Achi Baba this morning, 10.30 A.M. Some very close calls I can</p>
