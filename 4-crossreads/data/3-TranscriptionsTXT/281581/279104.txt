The exhibition was well patronised today. The color lantern is working excellently, but I regret the best of my pictures have yet to be hung. There are about 130 exhibits exclusive of the artists room. The largest picture an Episode during the battle of  Zonnebeke [West Flanders] measures about 21ft x 15 ft. It is a combination of 12 negatives. The color slides depict scenes on the West Front, Flanders, and also   Palestine. They are gems and elicit applause at every showing.  A military band plays throughout the day.
