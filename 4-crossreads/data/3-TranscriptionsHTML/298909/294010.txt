<p>4/7/16  Tuesday</p>
<p>Went for a route march to [blank] Canal &amp; saw the English Engineers with their great barges, ready for a retreat, or advance, these barges are readily turned into bridges over canals etc for heavy artillery. Had some practice at Gas Helmets. Heavy storm in the evening &amp; violent lightning &amp; thunder &ndash; We still get good news of our victorys &ndash; A lot of our division have moved nearer the firing line.</p>
<p>5th-7-16  Wednesday</p>
<p>Dull day &ndash; Gas practice &ndash; it is very sickening under the Helmets, had <strike>to</strike> half an hours drill without taking them off. General Birdwood Inspected the different Units. He told us he has volunteered to take Lille at the point of the bayonet, if the authoritys will give him the Australians.</p>
<p>Very severe bombarding at Ypres all last night &ndash; One cannot realize the meaning of heavy artillery &ndash; who has never seen or heard one &ndash; and such as is going on at our lines at present, is just terrifying &amp; hot enough for any thing altho very cold.</p>
