  
 This, together with patrols, formed the major part of the work until the start of the battle. While on one of the reconnaissances on the 14th, Pilots: Lieuts. P. J. McGinness, D.F.C., D.C.M., and D.R. Dowling, Observers: Lieuts. H. Fysh D.F.C. and E.A. Mulford, D.C.M. attacked a Runpler two-seater which they drove down near the JENIN Aerodrome. The enemy machine appeared to crash on landing. 
 When returning from a bomb raid on DERAA on the 17th a 'D.H.9' from No. 144 Squadron, R.A.F. crashed in enemy territory and two of our machines - Pilots: Lieut. H.A. Blake and D.R. Dowling, Observers: Lieuts. E. Sullivan and E.A. Mulford D.C.M. were detailed to destroy it before the enemy had time to remove it. This was deemed advisable particularly in view of the fact that this new type of machine had just arrived on the front. When our machines reached the locality they found that the crashed machine had been camouflaged with branches of trees. Lieut. Blake went down over the machine and succeeded in setting it alight with tracer ammunition. It burnt fiercely and was completely destroyed. 
 Early on the morning of the 19th, the big offensive was started by the Handley Page machine. Leaving the aerodrome at 1.15 a.m. this machine, from by Capt. R.M. Smith D.F.C., with Observers: Lieut. C.A. Mulford, D.C.M., M.D. Lees and A.V. McCann, proceeded to the important Railway junction at AFULE, where 16 - 112 -lbs. Bombs and several incendiary bombs were dropped. Considerable damage was done to the station buildings and the railway line. The Handley Page returned to the aerodrome just before dawn. That night the same machine, with the same Pilot and Observers, paid two visits to the JENIN aerodrome where they dropped 32 - 112-lb. bombs. When our troops occupied this centre a day or two later, it was found a good deal of damage was done on this raid. 
 Throughout the remainder of the day all machines of the Squadron were engaged 'strafing' the retreating enemy with bombs and machine gun fire.  26 Bombing flights were carried out during which 3 Tons were chiefly troops and transport on the TULKERAM-ANEBTA road, troops at TULKERAM, JENIN and AFULE aerodromes. A total of 16,900 machine gun rounds were fired during the day at various ground targets causing the greatest consternation. A number of our pilots made several trips over the line, merely returning to the aerodrome to replenish their stocks of ammunition. 
 When returning from one of these raids Lieut. H.S.R. Maughan, saw a 'D.H. 9' go down behind the enemy's line, where the pilot burnt the machine. Lieut. Maughan landed and under hostile rifle fire picked up the Pilot and Observer, whilst the enemy was kept off by machine gun fire from his Observer, Lieut. L.W. Sutherland M.C., D.C.M. Numerous dead were observed after the Bristol 'took off'. Lieut. Maughan flew his double load back to our aerodrome. For this he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. 
 A similar experience befell Lieut. A.V. Tonkin (pilot) and Lieut. L.C. Climie (observer). Their machine was hit from the ground while they were gunning enemy troops from a low altitude. They came down in enemy territory and were captured by the Turks who started to take them back with the retreating troops. They had not gone far, however, when the enemy saw our cavalry close on their heels. They thereupon galloped, forgetting all about Lieuts. Tonkin and Climie, in their hurry. These officers were overtaken by our cavalry and escorted back to our line. 
 By the following day the resistance of the enemy had been completely broken, and on all routes of retreat were large columns of retreating Turks. These were everywhere vigorously attacked by our machines with the result that the wildest possible confusion prevailed. Horses bolted over precipices, followed by motor lorries that were assisted on their way by the bombs; men ran excitedly in all directions, and in numerous cases deserted their convoys and fled into the hills. During the day 7.5 tons of bombs were dropped and 32,000 rounds were fired into these targets. This unit's proportion of these figures were: Bombs dropped 4,500 lbs., Rounds fired - 24,000. The balance is the aggregate of the remaining squadrons in the Wing.
