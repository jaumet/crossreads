<p>nicknamed "Matey" from the fact that he addresses everybody else by that name, is  pal of ours and we frequently get little additions to our mess from him. The cake is dreadfully burnt and tastes horrible.<br/>"Matey" when half tight drank a bottle of liniment in mistake for whisky and we had a hard<br/>job to pull him round. This was some considerable time ago but he still endeavours to<br/>show his gratitude for our services in the above mentioned way. Jack Warne is anyhow, a<br/>great forager and generally manages to secure something extra. Sometimes it consists of<br/>cocoa all round before we retire at night, a most welcome luxury, at others some tart or<br/>pie from the sergeant's mess.<br/>One of our victims has just arrived to have his leg dressed. He got kicked by one of the horses and the cut became septic so we have been fomenting him four times a day. He is like an alarm clock and arrives exactly on time every day. The different hours for treatment are posted on the door - texted by myself and I will repeat the notice to give you some idea of our usual hours of work. Dispensary Hours:- Sick Parade - 6 a.m. and 5.30 p.m.  Medicines - 6.30 a.m., 1.15 p.m.. 5 p.m., and 9 p.m.  Dressings - 7 a.m., 12 noon, 5 p.m.. and 10 p.m. At each of these times we are busy for about an hour but as you will see the hours in many cases overlap.</p>
