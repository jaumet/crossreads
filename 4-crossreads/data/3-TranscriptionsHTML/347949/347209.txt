<p>behind soldiers advancing never have I seen so many men on the move at one time. It was indeed glorious and one felt some good was being done. There were dead lying all around though none of ours thank God for that. One German I saw made me laugh. He had evidently been having something to eat &amp; was lying dead with a string of dry sausages in his hands raised up to his face. <br/>We had to take up a position at a certain hour 500 yards to the rear of the 3rd Div. who had hopped over first. That is 500 yards behind their new objective &amp; got there two minutes within time quite a flucke and they were digging in madly &amp;  then we went through them &amp; took up where they left off. We kept on advancing until 12 o'clock mid-day under our creeping barrage</p>
