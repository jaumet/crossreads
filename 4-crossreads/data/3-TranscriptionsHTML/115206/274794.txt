<p>In Front of Harbonniers. Bty, Pos<br/>Weather fine and clear. Laid an O.P. line with Tom and Ped Palmer 3&frac12; miles in length .<br/>Had a very exciting time doing so and the battery had the pleasure of doing some excellent shooting for the infantry. The 2nd Div were held up by a large garrison of [indecipherable] guns and these were eventually cleared. Smithy Tom and myself left for W.L. Battery was   to go out of action &ndash; but after going half way we returned again on the right of our old possie, 1st Div took Lahion. French took Montidier and one or two other small villages.</p>
