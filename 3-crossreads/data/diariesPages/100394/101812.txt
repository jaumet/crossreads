Inoculation report made out, to send to A.D.M.C. The storm has continued today. They say one becomes used to it in a week It is supposed to last a fortnight so the second week should be fairly pleasant. The natives call it by the name of Khamaeen. I put my blankets outside this morning but I had to dig them out tonight. I hear an old N.Z. lady (who is in charge of the Empire Club Canteen I mentioned run under the instigation of Lady Maxwell)

expressing very strong views a few days ago. She said it was a criminal shame in the first place to bring our boys to Egypt "Can you wonder’ she said "at the number of chaps being sent back home in disgrace when they are longing for a sight of their own women folk and none to see except black women who throw themselves at them" Capt. Mapleston M.O. of the Howitzer Bdge took my sick parade today. The storm seems to have blown away after a very heavy fall of rain

Capt Mapleston is taking the Howitzer Bdge 13th Bdge and D.A.C. at present so Bob Jack and I are working the dispensary together I was on duty last night. Today the A.I.F. canteens are opening as the native’s contracts have expired. We might get our things a little cheaper now. It has taken the Govt about 18 months to find out that we should have our own Canteens and I suppose we shall all move off as soon as they get properly going. Had 2 letters today, one from Adelaide Smith and another from the lady who sent my Xmas [indecipherable] from S.A.

I went round and saw Russ & Edric today and went for a swim in the Canal with them. We tried the new A.I.F. canteens and found them as dear as the natives and much harder to get near. My transfer into the Battery has been recommended and sent on so I expect to be a gunner any day now. I shall be very backward in regard to drill but should soon pick it up.
