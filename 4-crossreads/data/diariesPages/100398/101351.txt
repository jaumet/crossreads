Mild looking Senior officer (in charge disembarkation)
"Never mind – come along just as you are!" Flying man with M.G’s laugh long & loud.
Plymouth full troops going to front held up by subs. Consider us lucky to run through safely. People here have been very anxious re boats at sea during past couple weeks. Our O.C. tells us things very dicky for us just prior to arrival of T.B. flotilla. 
29th Detrained at Penham Downs 6.30 am Marched through mud & darkness about a mile to camp. Then marched aimlessly round the camp roads until 9 am looking for a home wherein to rest, 9 am still dark & wet, marched into huts – 15 in a hut – warm & snug when cleaned & fire lighted. Fooled round in mud all day getting fixed. two biscuits all day – the mob’s half starved & savage. Seymour was a king to this.
30th Fixed up at last. Complimented by commandant for good behaviour coming in. Tucker supply arriving slowly – margarine bread, a little jam, tea, & bully. Nothing hot so far, but promised. No work until hunger appeased. The trouble all arises from the mix up caused by the wreck, & subsequent splitting up of P Lincoln units among other ships.
