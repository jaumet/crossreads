<p>15.3.15</p>
<p>Mon 15th<br/>Was hauled out of bed at 3.15 this morning stables at 3.30 &amp; had breakfast &amp; was out on parade at 4.30;  The morning was slightly chilly about sunrise; but it was lovely riding, we gave our horses a feed &amp; had a bit of a "snack" ourselves soon after sunrise;  soon after we left camp Dowling's horse put his feet in a hole &amp; Dowling took a hand-spring off the pommel of the saddle but picked a soft spot to fall &amp; did not get hurt;  We had a sham fight with the New Zealanders &amp; returned to camp at 12</p>
