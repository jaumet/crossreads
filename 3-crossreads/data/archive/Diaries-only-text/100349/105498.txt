The anchorage is very treacherous here so no leave was granted. I slipped aboard a tender and stowed away was ashore for an hour and a half. A charming little port this. By a miracle I was not pinched when I returned. I should say that the hills around here would be the home of jumbucks. A lot of cargo was transhipped into lighters, and then we sailed a 8.P.M.
19/4/18.
Steamed along within sight of the coast all day. Arrived at Durban at 5.P.M. the harbour is shallow here but the wharves are decent. A white girl was signalling to the ship from the breakwater, she is said to meet every transport. The nigger stevedores are very active here, cargo and coal is flying everywhere. Durban seems to be a fair sized town from here.
