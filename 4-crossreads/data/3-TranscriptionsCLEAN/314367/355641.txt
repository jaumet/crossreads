  
 Tell Rawdon I again saw - - our familiar black & white fantail - He wagged & jerked his tail & said 'sweet pretty creature' in New Ireland just as well as at Glen Innes - I also saw another sight at sea - Huge numbers of white ? gulls or terns, intermixed with huge black birds - ? Skua gulls - They were attacking a shoal of fish - There were hundreds of them wheeling, dipping Screaming - White as snow drift &  but  every now & again a swift - arrow winged black kite of a bird swooped & got his share & as much more as he could seize - I've felt the want of a camera very badly - The whole of yesterday's native dancing wanted the camera - You cd have got no end of negatives - They had a clown with a cocoa nut face & I saw an Albino & examined him - No pigment - poor chap - white hair - red irises - photophobia - Red & white very harsh skin -
