To the Rev J.A. Ferguson
Supreme Court6 July 1916
Dear Mr Ferguson,I am sending you a few particulars about Arthur, "not necessarily for publication" but in order that you may have a clear conception  of the manner of boy he was.
His full name was Arthur Gardere Ferguson. He was 23 in November last. He took his second name from his grandmother, (who left France as a bride over 60 years ago, and was laid to rest at Waverley, just a few days before our eldest boy, Bernard, in 1912.) It seems strange to think that the dear boy should have come to his end just a few miles from her old home - with his face turned to the Waterloo battlefield, where his forebears had borne arms on both sides. It was almost on the eve of Waterloo day that he died - the 14th of June (See last page).
We have as yet no particulars of the manner of his death.
When the first Australian contingent was forming he was very anxious to offer his services. At the time his mother was very ill, and he knew that any fresh anxiety might cost her her life. He went to see Normand MacLaurin, commanding the 1st Brigade, under whom he had served in the Scottish rifles, where he held a commission. MacLaurin told him that his duty lay here, and he acquiesced simply, and said no word to his mother. I think that was the hardest thing he ever did in his life.
As soon as he knew that the danger to her was over, he got her permission to enlist, and went into camp at once.
