<p>as we can go down every time we come out of the trenches. It was hard luck for young Ledwidge losing his eye but one can lose more than that these times. I have seen Len Simpson but he is not in this Battalion now he is on the 5th Brigade and I have not seen Mick at all. I heard that Vick had enlisted but I have not got it from home as yet. I will try and send you along some P.C. from here if I can. It is a shame the way the places are smashed up around here all the windows are broken and in a great many cases houses are blown down.<br/>There is a town like Wagga only 25 minutes walk from the firing line but it is broken up although the people are living there I can't tell you where I am over here but I am in a good place just now living in a nice room and very little to do. Well Alice I have not got much news to tell you and we are not allowed to say anything, but we will soon be back in Australia again with a glorious victory. With best love to all<br/>Yours as ever<br/> Clarence<br/>PS I got a letter from Tom he was out on [indecipherable] then so I sent him a P.C. but I will write again in a few days as we get plenty of time to write now.</p>
