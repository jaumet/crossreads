 the book but it was not to be found in all Cambridg , so have just copi out a few of them that struck as particular fine though perhap a littl crude . I thought that perhap the Editress of " The Budget " might find room for one in the next issu . I receiv No 3 from Walli whilst in Franc and pass it on to Harri Vandi Geoff Woodriff and afterward Lt Gritten . I left Franc just afterward . I do n't know whether you have heard but poor old Van is miss or so Harri told me in his last letter . Poor old boy , he was such a fine chap . God rest his soul if he has pass to the great Beyond . Pleas give my love to the Mater
