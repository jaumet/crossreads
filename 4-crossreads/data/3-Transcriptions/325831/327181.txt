<p>Department of Defence<br/>Melbourne 10th August 1916</p>
<p>Dear Colonel Anderson</p>
<p>I am writing you in regard to a son of Judge Ferguson whom you probably know&mdash;who is in the 3rd Divisional Cyclists Coy, Third Division. His Initials are K. A.  Just prior to the outbreak of the war the Judge lost one son; the second has been killed in action, &amp; the subject of this letter is the sole surviving son. The suggestion has been made to me by some friends of the Judge that perhaps this son could be withdrawn from the firing line. From what I can gather the Judge himself is opposed to this course being taken, but his friends assert that this is due to the nobility of his spirit &amp; not to any lack of fatherly affection. I am referring the matter to you, as it appears to me, if he is to be withdrawn as suggested, that he must be employed either on your staff or that of General Sir Newton Moore. I wish you to understand, however, that I have no personal wish in the matter, &amp; I know that you will not disregard the interests of the service or any individual in any endeavour to meet the wishes of the Judge's friends.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>G. F. Pearce.</p>
