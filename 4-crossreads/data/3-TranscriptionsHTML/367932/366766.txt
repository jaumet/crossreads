<p>Copy of Lionel Bigg's letter.<br/> age, 20</p>
<p>H.M. SS. Hororata<br/>Off Lemnos<br/>24 December 1916 (1915)</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>Well it is all over successfully.  We got off quite safely, &amp; properly bluffed Johnnie Turk.  Everything was well done, well organised &amp; run to time, shows they can do things when they try &ndash; there wasn't one hitch.</p>
<p>On the night of the 19th Guthrie Tony Hordern, &amp; I, cooked our last meal in the old dug-out, where we had spent, the happiest 3 months since we joined the army.  We ripped up our waterproof sheet, and carried our packs, down the hill.  It was dark then, or rather moonlight, with a clear, warm sky.  The 3 or us, were in the covering party, and went straight into the trenches.  We knew we were to be the last 75 of the division to go on board &amp; had to hang to our post, if they came.</p>
<p>At 10 p.m. we heard that The Apex, Rhododendron, &amp; Battleship-Hill, had been evacuated, &amp; that 9 men, held &ndash; from our left, to the Apex, - about a mile &amp; a half.  They kept walking up and down the deserted trenches &ndash; firing a shot here and there.</p>
