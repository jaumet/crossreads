  
 that not only the light was wrong ( that  I'd expected) hut the sun had drawn up such a haze that all my subject was mist silhouetted! I groaned and came back and did a little study of a field telephonist's post - the dug-out in which I lodge. This afternoon the men are out reaping - with sickles-and the sky is dull as ditchwater. If my work satisfies them enough by the middle of August I'll get my comm. I see the Americans have done well again; good luck to them. The frogs too, are giving Jerry "what for".

Let's hope that whatever it was it will result in bringing calamity to the Huns. This morning has been gusty and squally so I have been lying in my dug-out. If there's
