 We have all been reduc to the rank , that is , all NCOs who brought the reinforc over - Oct Nov.9th . They will not recognis ani Australian school of instruct over here , which is veri remark when you consid the larg cost of send us to school in Australia . My candid opinion too , judg by the N.C. O 's . drill us now , is that the School of Instruction in Australia are veri good and as up to date as could be expect . Of cours minut detail differ somewhat , and men with activ servic experi must be credit with a lot , but to total discredit Australian School in which are mani instructor return from Flander and Gallipoli , is noth short of ridicul . This be so I have determin to tri and get into the next draught leav for Franc , where promot is perman . 12th Nov. 1916 I am in the draught for Franc as a privat , and expect to move soon . There are 10 men in all . One , J. Brown , left Sydney with me on the Orsova on the 14th Juli 1915 . He was shot in the mouth in Gallipoli return to Australia . Now we leav togeth again . Rather a coincid . Our train is strenuous . Musketri , - most rapid load fire , bayonet fight ? rush trench , stab use butt , and gas helmet drill . These are the most import and advanc part of Infantri Train . But it dread cold , and the rifl chisel junk of skin from your knuckl and hand . Our feet get like block of ice stand at musketri practic , and the rifl is so cold we can hard do anyth with it . It rain near everi day , and we are often wet through . But they give us no latitud . Reveill went at 4 am . on 16th Nov. Thursday . We were to move off , bound for Franc . The 3rd Btn detail was onli 10 men , the total for the brigad a small batch of 54 in all . My , it was cold . A few old pal got up to see us off . We had a warm breakfast and then march to the Battalion
