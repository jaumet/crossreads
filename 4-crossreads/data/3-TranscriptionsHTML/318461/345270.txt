<p>another posi / otherwise &ndash; had to leave this owing to the constant warning of gas &amp; not daring to go to sleep so joined some other fellows in another part of the ruined house &amp; there I sat on the floor all night expecting every second to be blown to atoms but altho they came alongside of us, at us &amp; round us none hit us after the one that got my two chums till daylight when feeling cramped I got up &amp; walked into the next room<br/>had just got into it when a shell came into the room where I had been, walked out of this room &amp; the same thing happened a shell came into the room I had just left amongst a lot of men wounding some I then went out to the place when I had taken my things to to see if it had been blown down &amp; no sooner got there when another shell came through at the corner, that was enough</p>
<p>I went for an early morning stroll up the road away from the shells &amp; after getting my nerves a bit steady made to come back when crossing what was once a railway line a whiz Bang just missed my head by ducking &amp; landed about 10 yards away. Some of the boys say I am not born to be killed by shells &amp; there is no get away from it, I am lucky, &amp; never thanked God for life so fervently. There seems some guiding force behind me when danger is near at all events so it seems to me.</p>
<p>Am now in charge of the Police &amp; have just had a sweet job looking for some men. saw several wounded whilst doing it</p>
