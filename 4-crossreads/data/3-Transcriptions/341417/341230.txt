<p>I have never had a day's sickness since I joined the force.<br/>Perhaps I could not say that if I had not enlisted. War is not the only place people die, is it?</p>
<p>I much prefer being here to Egypt. In fact, I don't fancy ever going back to city life.  Still "Coalopolis" is just as good, to me, as anywhere &amp; I hope I am allowed to return, when this job is over, to that place. ["Coalopolis" refers to Newcastle, NSW.]<br/>I would give anything to be able to see the war through, without being invalided. I think I will too. Never felt better in my life.</p>
<p>I sent a Army Christmas cake (ration biscuits) to you. Did you receive them.</p>
<p>I appreciate Miss Williams papers.<br/>The Bulletin &amp; N/C Herald are my favourites. Bulletins should be wrapped in ordinary newspapers. They are stolen otherwise I think.</p>
<p>Dear Drs I wish you the best of Greetings &amp; Benefits of Health &amp; Contentment this coming year.</p>
<p>Remember me to Mrs Dunlop, Miss Williams, Nellie Gray &amp; the dispenser.</p>
<p>Yours Faithfully<br/>Clem Walsh Capt.</p>
