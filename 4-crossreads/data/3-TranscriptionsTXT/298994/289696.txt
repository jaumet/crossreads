exchanged greetings with some "digs" here. We finally reached a point known as Prowse Point, some two miles from the support lines
We spent the night in a fairly big dugout here (Aug 25th 1917) We remained here all next day and at nightfall we proceeded on our way up to the line to join our new comrades in the 50th Battalion I had joined up A Coy.
The night was pitch dark, the whistle of shells overhead and some falling close at hand, did not seem very peaceful. Where did that one go to Bill 'Erbie? was a real question, one asked, not in playful mood either! We did get there eventually, through the mud and slush we spent the hell of a night listening to the whining of shells overhead.
We remained in the support lines till Aug. 31st 1917
