<p>During this afternoon the sigs were called for guard duties. Our watch being 8 to 10pm &amp; 2am to 4am. I was given a deck chair &amp; told to keep the men under a sergeants rank away from a water tap that gave most delicious, icy cold water. Needless to say when possible, they were at liberty to take as much as they wanted as far I was concerned. How can a man reasonably refuse his mates a drink of water when they are crowded up in the lower decks like sheep.(2 am) called out again for shift till 4 am but with some head work managed to evade it &amp;</p>
