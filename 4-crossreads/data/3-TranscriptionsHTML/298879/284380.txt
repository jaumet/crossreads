<p>Tuesday 25<br/>Fine. Great relief to see the sun come up on a clear day. Left hospital today to make room for other patients. HMS Triumph torpedoed by a hostile submarine. She turned over and sank in about 10 min. I with others of the Batt. saw the whole catastrophe. It was an awful sight. The submarine as far as we know has not been captured or sunk.</p>
