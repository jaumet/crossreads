In stinging itself to end its own agony this puny subject of animate creation blindly flounders till the butterfly, affrighted, flits away to reinact the illusion of a jewel where there might be peace as well as honied beauty to give it rest.From a field of corn, that lies hidden behind the hedges of the lane where the trench diggers are still at work, a skylark twinkles upward as straight as the spire of a temple, and with her she carries her silver net of jewels, and shakes them into melody as she lifts. It seems that she bears with her, as a precious tribute to heaven, the beauty that is too divine and too chaste to be left below where man in his greed, selfishness and lust has become debased and gross and is spending his energies in the savagery, the squalor, the wreck and the bloody strife of outrageous war.
