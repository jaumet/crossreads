<p>Cranston's Ivanhoe Hotel<br/>Bloomsbury Street<br/>London, W.C., 10 July 1915</p>
<p>My beloved Mother &amp; Father</p>
<p>I really don't know where to begin. I think I better tell you about the girls first.<br/>They met me at the train I forget which station &ndash; London. I was kissed suddenly from behind while trying to get into line and one sister was rushing up and down with an umbrella trying to straighten us out to receive orders from matron. Aunt Rosamond came with the girls. I was bundled into a taxi with three other sisters and driven here. I rang up St Cloud and the girls had gone back there to supper, they came in to see me on their way</p>
