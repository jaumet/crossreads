<p>The Square at Alexandra is the centre of the best shops &amp; warehouses in the city. Shaded with palms &amp; different shrubs, together with bright red flowers the whole blends very well with the pale grey buildings surrounding it. The old Sultan occupied a prominent position in centre on Horseback.</p>
<p>Working at PO all day not feeling too bright.</p>
<p>The square is filled to the overflowing each evening with all conditions of society. It is a gay spot, &amp; everyone is out to make the very best of life. The children revel in their games &amp; the older folks are bent on enjoying everything that comes along. It is a scene once seen never forgotten.</p>
