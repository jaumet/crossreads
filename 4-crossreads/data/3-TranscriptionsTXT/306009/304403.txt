 1915 Aug. 7 Sat. Kept pretty busy to-day as we admitted about 90 wounded &ndash; all stretcher cases &ndash; last night. One man died to-night, diagnosis: Enteric. In the evening with a couple of others, visited 2 of Cairo's largest &amp; finest mosques &ndash; One of them in particular looked splendid: beautiful carpets &amp; rich carvings &amp; ornamentation in a blaze of illumination &amp; the Mahommedans chanting their prayers.
