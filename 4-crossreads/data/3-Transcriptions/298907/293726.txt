<p>Was out this afternoon again with my girl Miss Allan, Biddy I call her she is a case but a real respectable girl of good parents she wants me to go down to tea with her badly but I am fighting shy, but I suppose I will come at it one of these fine evenings, we were up boating on the Worcesters Canal for a few hours then had afternoon tea &amp; home.</p>
<p>4th. Was out this morning for one hour for exercise but you might guess how much we done, went down to a little cafe instead &amp; had a cup of coffee &amp; some home made tart.</p>
<p>At 10 oclock Rilen &amp; I went into town &amp; on the bus I managed to lose a roll of films I was sorry for they were rather important ones, we got back again at 12.</p>
