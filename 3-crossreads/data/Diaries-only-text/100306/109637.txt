Slept in until late being still unwell. The Dr. had a sick parade and about 20 cases of trench feet were evacuated. One chap who had got lost and fallen into a shell hole lay there all one day too weak to get out. When he was examined this morning we found he had awful feet which had gone gangrenous being dead in patches. He will probably lose one foot by amputation or at least have the dead patches cut out of them Most of the cases will take about 3 weeks in hospital before they recover. The Huns are putting in some strafe round here this morning. Relief complete at 7 pm. Returned to the huts uneventfully but it was a long journey and we were exceedingly thankful for the cocoa that was on issue at the padre's soup kitchen. Going home all plugged along with good heart through the dark. Duckboards are a great boon but awfully monotonous. No shelling. At the huts the officers there had a good dinner for us and most had washed and cleaned themselves up. Davis to England tomorrow ? Elmige returning.
