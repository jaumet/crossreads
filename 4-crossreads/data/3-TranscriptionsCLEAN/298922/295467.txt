  
 Monday 21 May 1917 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  Went KHAN YUNUS to take summary of evidence in another  GROG  case. Beer does not do much harm, but the rotten whisky men get hold of causes a lot of trouble. Stayed the night & returned in morning. Had letters from Laura, the wife & Papers from Mrs. Cotton - Charlie had gone back to France. 
 Much of the Harvest is now being gathered by the inhabitants, in behind our lines. A broader Railway & Pipe line & many other improvements I noticed in my ride today.
