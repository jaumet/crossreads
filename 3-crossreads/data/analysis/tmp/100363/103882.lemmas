We have no definit sail time at present , but as an immens quantiti of mail have been put on board we expect to be off tomorrow . It amus us great to observ the extraordinari pattern and color paint on the ship hull to deceiv ' Sub ' . This weird " camouflag " gave them the appear of float circus craft . It is intend to deceiv enemi gunner by creat a fals impress as to a vessel size and speed . Person observ make one doubt it efficaci , especi if the sun is behind the vessel .
