<p>2.<br/>batteries &amp; things won't be the same when I get back.</p>
<p>Major Kingswell of whom you speak is an old friend of mine. I am expecting him over any day on leave &amp; will give him your message. Had a note from him a few days ago, when he was O.K.</p>
<p>The 24th battery where Wm O'Reilly was, was always alongside us. It was Major Riggall's command &ndash; he is a Melbourne Solicitor &ndash; but his battery will likewise have been divided now between 2 batteries of the 3rd Brigade.</p>
<p>My chaps have been out of the line since Xmas for a rest, long overdue &ndash; &amp; now I think there will be about a months training to get the reorganisation into shape.</p>
