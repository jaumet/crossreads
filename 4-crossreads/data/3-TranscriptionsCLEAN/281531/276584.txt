5/8/18Villers-Bretonneuxin it - set off on a round of the companies. Slipped and slid about a good deal and found the chaps all crouched up in their bivvies. They are tired. All the officers are pretty well. Met my old friend Pte. "Squeaker" Dyson and we very cordially shook hands! This is a democratic Army. Noticed our Yanks today cordially shake hands with some of their sergeants. Found some chaps rather uncomfortable and arranged to put them in bivvies vacated by Yanks. Called on Colonel Brazenor and then returned back. Rumoured that the Boche raided about two Bns. down on our right last night so we are exercising special care. Guns of all calibres coming up here tonight.
