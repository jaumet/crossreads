  
 Tuesday 27 June 1916 Very wet & miserable day making everything underfoot in a fearful state. Not much other than censoring & writing a few letters during the day, excepting when Fritz started to shell the place just opposite, landing shells all round our place & making us get out into the shelter trenches in a violent hurry. A very quiet night.
