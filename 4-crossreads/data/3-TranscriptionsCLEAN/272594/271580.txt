We have a beautiful Sergt Major here the great bully has not been near his Batt. since the 19th May 1915 & I expect he is ashamed to go back now, how they would all like to see him kicked out of the Camp he is hated by all ranks. Jock Mackie has gone to Southampton on escort duty he will be away for 36 hours. Have just discovered tonight that we have used the first 2 films in my Kodak the wrong way round (I am learning slowly).
