Oct 17th '17 And so another day is done which pretty well chrystallizes our mental attitudes at the end of each day, - If we think about it at all - Far happier is he, indeed who thinks not at all these days. For what is there to think about? Each day passes by in colourless monotony exactly as its predecessor &  its predecessors innumerable since the time when  we last experienced some sharp emotion, as change of scene or a battle etc.
