<p>party I don't know where we have to go perhaps the firing line.<br/>I am doing a bit of letter writing to-day I don't care much about the job but it has to be done all the same.<br/>Some empty shell case's dropped from the clouds quite close to our billets this morning, our chaps were shelling a German plane which was up early doing a bit of scouting.<br/>What a difference there is between these French people who are selling things to us &amp; the Gyppos, they never want the money first like the Gyppos, but will put their basket down &amp; you can select the articles you want &amp; pay after, they trust us &amp; we give them a fair &amp; square deal.<br/>The weather is very dull &amp; cloudy &amp; it looks like rain this afternoon.</p>
