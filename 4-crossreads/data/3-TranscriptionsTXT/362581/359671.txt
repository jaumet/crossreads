 My darling Eddy, 
 Received Mother's letter with yours of Sept 1st-3rd   &amp;  was very sorry to hear you had been ill again. Hope you are quite well again, now the warm weather will be there is may be better for you. It is horribly cold   &amp;  the frost to-day is fearful. My poor feet  &amp;  hands are awful. Hope you are quite well now. Fondest love  &amp;  kisses . From Auntie Eadle
