Took a couple of Orderly Rooms and saw Staff Capt Hale about getting rid of our Transport. Met Father Campbell and there passed a car containing R.C. bishop who got out very gorgeous in a purple cassock and tiny surplice. Had a good bath at the Railway station about 2.30. After evening mess went to the Concordia Hall to see the ?Smart Set" 4th Divnl. Concert Party. They were very good indeed and gave a fine programme but their ?girl" is not as good as the one in the 5th Bde. Party. The hall is a Catholic institution. Home about 9 just in time to see the Cinema coming out. Orders for 167 people to go on draft on the 21st ? put in some time picking them and so to bed.
