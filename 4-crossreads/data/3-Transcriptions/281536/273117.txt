<p>2/8/19 Cape Town<br/>Delay in getting a<strike>ships</strike> pilot made us stay alongside till 9. Several sharp squalls came up. As soon as we got out past the breakwater she started to pitch heavily but happily no rolling. Some of the local people flashing little mirrors from their houses by way of greeting. This used once to be very prevalent here and many houses doing it made a novel and pretty sight. As we got well off shore the boat rolled so heavily that things were sliding from one side of the ship to the other. I had to go to bed sea sick at 10 am and stayed there all day. The mess decks were crowded with sick men. At times the ship rolled to an angle of 30&amp;deg and we felt it all the more coming straight from port.</p>
