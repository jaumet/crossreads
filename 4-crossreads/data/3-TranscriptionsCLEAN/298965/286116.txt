  
 coal 2 water aboard when we arrived. The sight of Colombo from the ship makes a chap feel like going ashore  & having a ride in one of the rickshaws he can see from the boat. We stopped in Colombo from Nov 15th till Nov 18th during which time we had got water aboard. While we were getting water the N.Z. & certain other ships left a day before us on their way to Aden. We left on Tuesday 15th & caught the rest of the Troopships up on Wednesday 19th Nov. 
 Nov 21st We all got up in the morning to find all the boats had stopped & we naturally thought something was in the wind but the stoppage was only caused through two boats coming into a slight collision. We arrived in Aden on Wednesday morning 25th Nov & after stopping there a day for coal & water supplies
