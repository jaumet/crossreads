<p>morning at 6.30 and was given no duties. I had a hot foment put on my hand which is to be renewed every 4 hours.</p>
<p>At Dixemude yesterday three Divisions of Australian troops went over the top, supported by the Black Watch &amp; other troops. They gained all their objectives and were still going. It is rumoured that this Division is to go to their assistance in about a fortnight.</p>
<p>This is 1145 day of the war. When it goes 1177 days it course of 42 lunar months, according to scriptural prophiesy will be completed. Time will tell if this is the allotted duration of this dreadful &amp; appaling war.  [Shorthand transcribed as follows.]  I wrote to my dear wife this evening.  Letter 93, 4 pages.  I also sent a post card "greetings from the trenches" to my cousin, Mrs. Will Rilley, Coolaness, Irvenstoron, Ireland.  [End of shorthand] The February reinforcements of the Victorian artillery that my brother is in is really the 14th of the 4th Field Artillery Brigade. The "Daily Express" to day reports "High explosive reply to the German Peace talk". Great new offensive in Flanders. Advance of one mile into the German positions near the Menin road. "Pill-boxes" smashed. Enemy garrisons "literally danced with Fury". Valuable positions captured. Very few casualties. Our men "went over" very light, that is without packs &amp; other heavy kit.</p>
