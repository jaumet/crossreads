<p>1919<br/>April 5<br/>trams are electric but are very small only holding 20 &ndash; 30 people including strap-hangers.  They are fitted with air brakes but this is only used as an emergency, as the compressed  air is not pumped up automatically, but is obtained from a reservoir at the station at Charleroi.  When the air brake does go on, everyone knows it.  We arrived in Charleroi &amp; met Sgt. Kirkby.  He had leave as well.  On enquiring at the station, it appeared that the Paris train did not go till 9.30 pm, &amp; was the Cologne Express.  We had a look around the town &amp; YMCA which was on top of a big resteraunt.  This resteraunt seemed to provide everything.  I noticed that some of the citizens were entertaining their friends there.  On several tables men were playing chess, draughts &amp; dominoes after the style at Mockbells].  At the back was a big billiard room, &amp; upstairs, a reading room.  I was rather surprised to notice a woman attendant in the men's lavatory, but it seemed to be the regular</p>
