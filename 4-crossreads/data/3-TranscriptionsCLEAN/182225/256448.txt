1916   SATURDAY 25   NOV.
Fine & warm. Saw Auntie Flo first thing & then went up to the Bank with Eric Murray (Mrs Angus' brother) & a good fellow. Went to see the dentist afterwards but he was out with some sickness so did not get my teeth seen to. Went round & saw Auntie F at her workshop & then picked Poss & Kieth up & we had dinner at Hatchetts & went on to "Flying Colours" at the Empire afterwards & it was jolly good. Had dinner Saw Dr Whylie (a throat specialist) after & he says I want an operation for my throat. Had dinner at Simpsons & Poss & I went to "Vanity Fair" at the Palace after & it was a great show. I camped with Poss at 71 Jermyn St that night.
