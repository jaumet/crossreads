 Thursday 10 October Another walk round the lower part of the Royal Mile to Holyrood Castle. Edinburgh is the finest city I have yet been in, a city of liesure, learning &amp; refinement.  Business is not brisk &amp; the Streets are seas of smiling faces. The general opinion of the people I have met is to have no peace until the Germans are thoroughly defeated. 
 Friday 11 October Forth Bridge by a char-a-banc.  The drive is very fine indeed &amp; the country &amp; autumn colouring in the trees are glorious. The Bridge impressed me very much &amp; is a tremendous structure. "Fair &amp; Warmer" this evening.
