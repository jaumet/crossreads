Shelter Wood Camp
2/2/17 A warm sunny day at last and the thaw has commenced. We are rather tired of trying to spread frozen butter on bread that is hard as iron and thaws to a hard dough when one tries to toast it. All available men outside specialists moved off today to fatigues all round the area. The Lewis gunners unde Slater King and the bombers under Slater carried on busily and it is hoped to get them firing live stuff in a day or two. Signallers, scouts and observers are busy on their respective work. Notice a great improvement in the batmen's department today owing to two of them having been sacked last night and marched out to do fatigue work this morning. Applied to visit the Rouen Records office at the same time as the Abbeville visit. The country round here presents a busy sight with troops and transport ever on the move and semicircular huts sprinkled in camps round the landscape. All officers are to attend a lecture on Bombing by Joe Slater tonight and one by King tomorrow on the Lewis gun and its use. An exam. to follow in a weeks time
