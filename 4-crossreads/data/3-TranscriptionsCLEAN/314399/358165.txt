Tuesday 17 June 1919Really fine in the morning. Janet & I went for a walk over the hills in the morning & in the afternoon Violet, Janet & I cycled to Loch Eck. Was lovely. It is a freshwater loch. Violet got a puncture & we didn't have any solution or rubber so stopped two men in a cycle side car & they gave us the necessary. Fixed it up & then came home. Went for a bonnie walk after tea.
Wednesday 18 June 1919Nice again today. There was a couple of showers tho. Wasn't too bad tho. Janet & I cycled to Loch Long & Ardentilly [Ardentinny]. Was bonny too. Hills & trees right on the road. After lunch we stayed home & talked to Janet's Sister in law. After tea she went home & Violet, Janet & I cycled to Glen Massan falls. Very nice there too. We were driven away from the place tho by Midges (gnats).
