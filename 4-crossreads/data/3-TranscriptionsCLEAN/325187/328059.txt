 Staying here for 2 more days so am sending this as Registered letter let me know if these notes arrive. Have been made a member of the Mediteranean Club during stay- wrote Laura & the little wife Beautiful weather but day & night - the Searchlights from [indecipherable]  light up all the bay- the moon is full at present.  Love to you all little Mother, I never forget you each day when I scribble these notes.
