<p>boy. You &amp; Mrs Ferguson should not regret his loss, you should be proud of him in Death as I am sure you were in Life. I can hope for nothing better for my Son than that he may live &amp; die as nobly as yours did.</p>
<p>I am going to Australia next month &amp; I will call &amp; see you if I may.</p>
<p>I wrote to Mr King the Head Master at Clifton &amp; I enclose his letter. I think it will give you all the information available.</p>
<p>Believe me<br/>Sincerely Yours<br/>C F Warren<br/>Lieut Colonel.</p>
