<p>February 9<br/>And fatigues to up, &amp; fatigues come down,<br/>The duckboard track to the line,<br/>Ten men go up, and six come down,<br/>The duckboard track from the line.</p>
<p>Huddled shapes four,<br/>On the black-smudged snow<br/>And a broken track to the line<br/>And the wind tells a tale<br/>That is whispered low,<br/>Of a duckboard track to the line.</p>
<p>150.<br/>This afternoon, searching for a Venus pencil in Ballieul, some wounderful Brussels lace in one of the square shops &amp; a half hour spent there, my eyes are bad, the lace's exquisite designs half lost in a blurr.  Bought "Guy and Pauline" (Mackenzie 2.50).  I've read it, but it's worth the re-reading, also in a deluxe harlot shop Mais' "Shakespeare to O. Henry" &ndash; the 1st edition, 10 Francs.</p>
<p>Tonight in the Rec. Hut a concert, Vin S., George D. and others.  George down for the evening.</p>
<p>151.<br/>Today I'd my desire of the last month, but the result not up to expectation.  When he joined the unit at Bois St. Julien, I noticed him before all the others, today after dinner in the Rec. Hut I made a rough sketch, when I've good pencils &amp; paper, I'll do him again.  A fine star night.</p>
<p>February 10<br/>152.<br/>Again no mail.</p>
<p>Read awhile Mais' "Shakespeare to O. Henry", of Masefield &amp; The Modern Novel, Stage &amp; Poetry, a good book for occasional reading.</p>
<p>153.<br/>Yarning this night with Basil, of "Gheitz" our new-born unit rag, it's to be suddenly, and without warning, laid in an unsuspecting ambulance.  Frank to do the Colonel for [indecipherable] page, then overleaf an "Old Song", of Brasse, so to Basil's satire "A's", to personal notes and Decoration to Bob's socialistic note to a verse (149) and a finishing sketch of "Bailleul".</p>
<p>Tonight we blocked out all the matters:  tomorrow printing and composing starts.</p>
<p>Supper of Welsh Rabbit, Toast and Beer, to an arguing on syphilis and its permancy under the present social order of things.</p>
<p>Frank S. has from Paris a fascinating 'City Plan' &ndash; full of tiny sketches of lovely buildings:  and long boulevards.</p>
