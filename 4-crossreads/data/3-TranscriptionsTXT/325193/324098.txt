 [Transcriber's note: The diary of L/Cpl. Harris Fuljames covers six days from 5-10 June and then 3 October 1917.  He is at Messines and gives a description of the fighting during this time and his thoughts on the events.  The first letter to his mother describes his time at the Somme, Ploegsteert, Messines and Ypres.  The second letter is written from Hospital at Brockenhurst, U.K. where he is recovering after he had, as he says, "the misfortune to be blown up with a shot in the first stage of the big German advance".  The New Zealand Roll of Honour states that he died on 27 June 1918 and is buried in Brookwood Military Cemetery, U.K.] 
 Written by late 22962 L/Cpl. Harris John Foljambe Fuljames, 3rd N.Z. Machine Gun Coy. but a true Australian.
