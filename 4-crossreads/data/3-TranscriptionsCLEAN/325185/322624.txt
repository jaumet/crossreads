 Dear Father Well reported at nine o'clock this morning along with all the rest that had been on final leave. We were issued with all equipment. Order came just when we werent wanted for the reinforcements & were to go back to A2  again. Handed all in again. Then they found A2 had been filled up so we were sent to Y1 in the sheds again. Had only been there about an hour when fresh orders came for us to go back to the 7th again just got ready when that was cancelled & we were told to stay were we were. I dont know what we are going to do. Our transfers are being held back until tomorrow. It appears they caught a good few of the deserters from the 18th & 19th before they sailed so they had to go then the men from the 7th that had been sent
