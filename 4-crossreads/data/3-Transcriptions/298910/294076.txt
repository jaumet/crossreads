<p>have been here 6 weeks ago, when not so cold &amp; nice &amp; dry. From our front line can be seen the steeple of a Church at Bapaume. Had a bit of so called stew &amp; tea both cold. Rations supposed to be issued to squads of 12 men &ndash; quite a mystery none to be found &ndash; to bed a stiff &ndash; sore &ndash; cold &amp; wet Australian dinkum.</p>
<p>26/10/16  Thursday</p>
<p>Drizzling Rain. Had the day off till 4 pm then started for "Turk Lane" &ndash; relieved the 8th &ndash; Did an awful perish all night &ndash; altho 3 of us worked hard all day trying to make a bit of a shelter &ndash; it kept the wind &amp; cold out a bit, but the rain came thro. Made a fire in a tin &amp; nursed it during the night. Ted Powell went to sleep with feet against the tin &ndash; I also had just dozed off when I was rudely awakened by "Powell" falling over me, this puttees alight &ndash; I burnt all my hands trying to smother it &ndash; Fairly busy during the night. Guns going a treat all around us without cessation. Fritz replying poorly.</p>
<p>27/10/16  Friday</p>
<p>Drizzling rain &amp; cold as frogs &ndash; Shifted up to Grove Avenue &ndash; fairly busy. About a dozen of our bearers are out of action through blightys &ndash; sprained ankles</p>
