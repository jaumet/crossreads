3:  Sgt. Weir died of smallpox.  Wagon supplied to convey body to the cemetery, as a hearse could not be obtained, though gun carriages were easily procurable.  Funeral a disgrace to those responsible as the grave was only three feet deep & we had to put the body aside whilst we dug the grave again.  Human bones were scattered about the cemetery & the whole affair was scandalous.
10:  Fire in camp of Lovat Scouts, result of a drunken spree.  50,000 rounds & five machine guns lost in the fire.  Whole of the guard placed under close arrest.
15:  Action at Girga between 3rd rgt. patrols & party of Bedouins.  Fearful weather; 115 in shade at noon.
16:  Birthday; received an injection of para typhoid as gift from quack.
25:  Cricket match & concert to celebrate the landing.  Good dinner & concert, which was attended by notables of the town. Ambulance defeated Hdqrs. in cricket match by 56.
