  
 forms for the whole ships company.  After tea we made out lists of the next of kin address, of each man, the form to be forwarded to the Navy Dept Melbourne & High Cmr London.  Witt & I then went for a walk down town, I called at a dyers where I had left a velour hat to be dyed a fortnight ago, but they did not have it finished so perforce it has to stay behind & if they feel so disposed for them to forward it.

We could plainly hear the humming buz of an aeroplane but though we looked for a long time we could not see any.
