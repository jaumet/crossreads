  
 6 Evening   We expect to leave at 8 o'clock this evening.  Have not seen Uncle Walter. It has been a lovely sunny day; first we have has since leaving Sydney; it is nice to leave Australia in the sunshine though I expect we will have too much sun soon. If I have as good a time the rest of the trip as I have had so far, it wont be too bad; in fact I have enjoyed it even when it is rough. Fraid this is a ladies letter all P.S. Love Rob Wish I had a map of our route we are always having arguments as to where places are, must get one first chance.
