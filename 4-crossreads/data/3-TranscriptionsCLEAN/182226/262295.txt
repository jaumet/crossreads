 I had come to the end of my envelopes & had been promised one by one of the 21 st.  Last night he had an eye knocked out by a bullet so I went up to his mate & told him about it & said as the chap would not be coming back he would have no further use for them so he could give me a few. I got 8 altogether & some writing paper. "It's an ill wind - etc". 
 Changed my sox today, I have worn them day & night for six weeks. "This is the life". The fun of it is that I would not have been able to have a change yet only that I picked up a dirty pair that someone else had thrown away. 
 Bread issued today. 
 It is my 24 hrs off & I am taking things easy. 
 The fleet continue to keep up a heavy fire on the right. 
 Two new aeroplanes reconoited the Turkish positions under a heavy shrapnel fire.
