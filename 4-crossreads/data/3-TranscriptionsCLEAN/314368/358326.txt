 Dear Ida Since writing the letter that you will find accompanying this one I was lucky enough to get some mail , and was very glad to hear from home, I think I got 7 from you and the photos. 2 from Percy and 1 from Clarry. I also got one from Elsie Edwards and one from Ivy and Violet. I can tell you that they cheered me up a bit because we had had no news of home since leaving. Now that mail is coming I suppose it will come regularly and it will seem more like old times to hear from home once a week. I was very pleased to know that all at home were well that Clarry had shifted up to Orange and best of all that Aub was getting well again. He'll have to buck up and get well by the time I get back. I must look about and send him home something, a few cards for a start, till I get some money for something else, now that we are in England it is much easier for letter writing if the envelopes are stamped they go like an ordinary letter and are not censored as they were in Egypt. I am going to cable to tell you of my arrival in England
