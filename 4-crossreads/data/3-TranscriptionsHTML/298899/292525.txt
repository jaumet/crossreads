<p>took them to our camp at Dickebush during the day following. Gunfire increasing again which points to another attack shortly.</p>
<p>Friday 19th Oct.  Went to Dickebush with my letters for the post. Saw where they were bombed the night before, one tent being destroyed, luckily no one was in it at the time. While waiting for a car to come back had an hours sleep &amp; two hours when I reached the C.C.S. before going on duty. Night quiet so did some reading &amp; two more hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Saturday 20th Oct  When thinking about going to bed I heard that a lorry was going to Dunkerque on the coast so asked the S.M. if he had any objection to my going. He had but gave way &amp; we left at 9 A.M. reaching Dunkerque shortly after 11 A.M. The roads were good &amp; we passed through the sector held by the French then reached that of the British again when we approached the coast.</p>
