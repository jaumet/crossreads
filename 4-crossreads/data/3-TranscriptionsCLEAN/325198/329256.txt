It is a bad place for water. the drinking water is brought here by train & we get one water bottle full each morning.  For washing we have to depend on well water as in the water in the channel is said to cause sores & "Nile fever" if it is used. It is an awful dusty & windy day.  All ones food gets covered with sand.  This afternoon A troop rode over to the Suez canal for a swim, a number of us swam right across, so have been on both Africa & Asia to day  Stable picquet to night, its not much of a job, have to go on at 3.0 in the morning
