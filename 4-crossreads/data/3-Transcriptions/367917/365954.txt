<p>Belgium<br/>28/12/18</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Justice Ferguson,<br/>I hope you will not be disappointed that your fine parcel &ndash; by medium of the 20th Battalion Comforts Fund &ndash; reached an officer and a Victorian at that. It was greatly appreciated and the interesting specimens of our flora were of special interest to my Belgian host &amp; hostess. We fellows are very comfortable nowadays in good billets amidst a generous and grateful people. I hope your son is now thoroughly recovered from his severe wound of last year. I was his opposite number at 2nd Aust D.H.Q. and in Sept-Octo. 1916 was attached to 5th Bde Hqrs with the late Gen. Holmes.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>J. G. Menzies Capt.</p>
