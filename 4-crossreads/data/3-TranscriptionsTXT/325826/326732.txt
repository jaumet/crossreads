 3.  Of Wal I have seen quite a delightful lot &amp; we have only wished that you could know we were together.  It was Wednesday of last week that I wrote to you last.  Well on Thursday night just as I was going into dinner he appeared for a tiny few minutes just to make sure that I would be free to go out for the day on the following day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day Friday, he appeared about 10 o'clock and I was ready, with lunch, &amp; we set out.  He would insist on our having a cup of tea, I was going to say first, but now I remember it was after our return from viewing the parade in front of the Sultan's palace.  Quite a grand little affair it was, carried on though it is every day, and we quite enjoyed watching it.  The Egyptian uniform is quite charming, that is their show uniform- navy with gold buttons, white legging things, &amp; red fez caps.  The ordinary troops wear khaki drill uniforms, on service I mean. I expect Wal will have described to you our attempt to get a felucca to go up the Nile to a place called Barrage, where we intended to have lunch &amp; then return late in the afternoon by train.  We failed to get a boat on any reasonable terms at one bridge &amp; then had a delightful walk of about a mile through some bright beautiful gardens to the next bridge, where we also failed, &amp; finally about a quarter to two landed at the Railway station intending to take train, but found there was none till 4 o'clock.  After all we had our lunch here in my room (I am so often thankful it is nice &amp; large) and then went up to the Citadel, and proud I am to be able to take my big brother to these new, to him, places in this heathenish town that I have got to know so well.
