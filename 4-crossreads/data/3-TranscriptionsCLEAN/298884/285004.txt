"Nurse" and the jokers not knowing exactly which cabin bed the "Nurse" slept in, knotted every pair of pyjamas in the cabin & we had to spend about an hour untying them.  The first person to catch a Fools Day's joke was the Ship's Master, Captain Adamson.  He trotted around for a while with the notice "1st April" pinned to his coat tail.  The crowning joke of all though was played on the "Nurse".
At 11 o'clock Capt. Titford called a meeting of C. Coy Officers in the smokeroom & after telling us something which we already knew, we sauntered out.
