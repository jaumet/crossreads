<p>-3- 8th October 1916.</p>
<p>Well all good things have to end and our holiday is drawing to a close.  We go back early Tuesday morning.  It certainly has been some holiday and a very crowded one and I've enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
<p>Here in brief is where we've been, -</p>
<p>London to Birmingham, Birmingham to Leeds, Leeds to Leicester, Leicester to St. Pancras, London to Eastbourne and Eastbourne to Ealing.</p>
<p>If you get hold of a map you will be able to see that we've travelled some in a week.</p>
<p>To-morrow, Monday, we are going to have a day in London with the theatre at night, and are leaving first thing Tuesday morning.  It will be a great strain going back to it all again, and all we've got to look forward to now is another twelve months to pass, when our leave will come round again, or else Peace in the meantime.</p>
<p>Have fitted myself out pretty well.  Bought a watch etc., but I'm sorry to say will have to put some money back in the Bank as I hadn't time to spend it all.  Shame, isn't it?</p>
<p>Well I'll close now.  Am expecting to find a big mail waiting for me in France and if I can think of anything else to tell you, will write from there.</p>
<p>Had my photo taken at Eastbourne &ndash; didn't have time in London.  Will send you over a couple when they come along.</p>
<p>Hope all are well at Home.  Love to all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
