<p>to all who desired to go ashore. ,At 9 a.m. I visited Colombo with four pals, we engaged a car for two hours, &amp; had a glorious trip around this famous Eastern City. The price charged was "6/- a head", this cannot be called too much, as we saw some of the famous sighs of the World. The first part of the trip was indeed <strike>an interesting one</strike> a pleasant one, and was full of interest all the way. We drove to Mount Lavinia, a pleasant resort by the sea seven miles out of Colombo. At every turning of the road, something of special note met our gaze - first the busy scene of the main streets of Colombo, then our entry into the Native Quarters, which always has a certain amount of charm about it, through groves of cocoa-nut plantations, &amp; then our arrival at Mount Lavinia, where we had some light refreshments at a typical Oriental Hotel.  The view of the sea with the breakers, dashing against the rocks below, was a fine one, &amp; worth going miles to see.  The driver of the car could speak good English, so we informed him that we wanted to see all he could take us to, during the two hours. He did his best for us, as on the return journey to the City, we visited various places. I have forgotten most of the names;  but, the most important were the Buddist Temple, Victoria Park, &amp; the Cinnamon Gardens. We made a hurried inspection of the former place, &amp; wrote our names in the visitors book. The Eastern Street scene, staged by Oscar Asche in Kismet, &amp; Chu Chin Chow, were not at all exaggerated, but are true in every detail. One would think on seeing the above on the stage, that the numerous bright colouring was carried a little too far. Nothing of the kind - during one portion of the trip, I could not help noticing the great contrast in colours. The road was made of a kind of red gravel, on either side was a wall, stretching for nearly a mile, painted a deep orange <strike>colour</strike> shade . Then the beautiful palm &amp; cocoa-nut trees all out in green foliage, and last but not least, the pretty residences or bungalows, which were dotted here &amp; there, containing numerous descriptions of lattice work, all painted in different colours. All were pleasant to the eye, &amp; for over a mile we travelled through country like this.</p>
<p>We left the car at 12.30 &amp; dined at a small hotel, the price of the meal was very reasonable. Rickshaws were engaged for</p>
