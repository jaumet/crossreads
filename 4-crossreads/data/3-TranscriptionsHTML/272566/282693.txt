<p>Dull.<br/>2 runs to A.D.M.S. Scottish Lines Busseboom.<br/>To 5th Div. A.P.M. (Ouderdom).<br/>To 30th Battalion (Ouderdom).<br/>I saw an impressive scene today at Ouderdom railway siding &ndash; A great procession of Tanks was making its way to the railway platform.  I counted 40 of them as they made their way across the fields towards the Railway.<br/><u>Note:</u>  It transpires later that these tanks went to Cambrai front.</p>
