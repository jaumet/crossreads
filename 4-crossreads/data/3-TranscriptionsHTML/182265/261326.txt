The Mayor treated us afterwards &amp; showed us many souvenirs his son (M.C.&amp; bar) had brought from France. I left Salisbury about 10 &amp; cycled back to camp in about an hour.</p>

<p>Last Monday evening I gave an address on &quot;Early Church History&quot; to the proposed members of the C.E.M.S. in the Church Hut</p>
