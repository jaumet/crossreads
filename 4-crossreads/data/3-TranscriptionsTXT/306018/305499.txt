 March 1918 sultry &amp; cloudy &amp; at night it came on to rain &amp; rained fairly steady all night, an unusual thing here.  The town is very flat &amp; rain is not too good for it.  All the water has to be swept into the sewers.  There are some boats in from Australia  &amp; we expect some letters in a day or two. 
 Monday 11th Usual days work.  Had a quiet read in the afternoon.  Sent some photos out to Todd &amp; Phillip, the group we had taken with Mrs Cornish at Mena House.  The "Scamps" opened again this time at the Opera House.  They stages "A Chinese Honey moon".  The Theatre is beautiful, all the seats are of Red plush &amp; the boxes are very much larger than the ordinary.  The stage is very large.  The dressing &amp; the costumes were very good, but several things combined to spoil the play, &amp; I was pretty tired of it when it was over. 
 Tuesday 12th The weather has turned real fine again.  Got paid today.  Was absolutely without &frac12; a piastre.  A boat arrived from Australia  Colonel Fuller of the 6th LH was on
