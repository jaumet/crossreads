<p>raining like blazes, and we were wet through and covered in mud so the fact that the floors of the tents were all mud didnt worry us, we just dropped and we must have slept, for I woke up next morning stiff &amp; cold as a Polar bear, we were in Coolgardie Camp alright but we got out of it at 12 marched to a train bumped us in the open waggons and brought us to a place where we had to march 5 miles to another place</p>
