 1915 Dec.14 Tue. Not feeling too good since I got asthma attack &ndash; is still on my chest. What cunning jokers the Egyptians (Gippies) are! The tramfare from Gezira to Cairo is 2 milliemes &amp; the ticket collector oftens says that he cannot give change of &frac12; piastre &ndash; (we only use milliemes on the tram). Many an argument do we have to prevent them fleecing us. If a chap looks like a new arrival he is not even offered change.
