<p>to be turned into the road where it is stabled, I carried on until after Lunch when an Engine which had been turned was ready to move off, I was putting the lever over to lock &amp; steady the Table &amp; before I could secure the lever the Engine moved &amp; the Lever flew back &amp; I had the misfortune to be in the way &amp; the lever hit me on the Forehead above the left eye, making a nasty wound &amp; causing the Blood to flow freely, which no doubt accounted for me not being knocked unconscious, as I felt very dazed a corporal came to my assistance &amp; helped me over to the First Aid Post at the Station where <strike>my</strike> a Pad was placed on the Wound &amp; bandaged up &amp; I came back to the Camp &amp; visited the Camp Hospital where the Medical Officer, put two Stiches in the wound &amp; I had to rest in Camp, for a Week, &amp; report myself to the M.O. every morning at 9 am, where the wound was bathed &amp; examined &amp; rebandaged again, I spent the week lying down Reading &amp; Writing &amp; of an Evening playing Cards or Draughts until 9.30 Pm sometimes I would dress &amp; promenade into St Omer for exercise,</p>
