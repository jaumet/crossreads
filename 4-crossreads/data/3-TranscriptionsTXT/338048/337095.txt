 Saturday 24th Another fine day with good swell. Buzzer in morning &amp; holiday afternoon. "Warilda" still lagging. 
 Sunday 25th Church parade in morning. "The  though  being dead yet speaketh" being applied to Kitchener. Communion in afternoon followed by a song service on deck. Bought bottle Fruits Salts to help while going through tropics as I was feeling a trifle peculiar. 
 We have now settled down to the routine properly and hardly look upon this as a  trip  voyage with a destination in mind but more as an unusual sort of life. Constant view of the other vessels also makes this portion of trip different to the first portion. 
 All lights are now prohibited on deck after dark &amp; all portholes are closed with blackened windows. Song service took place on G. troopdeck. Had a good sing and a Chaplain &amp; two Lieuts organized it until 7 pm. when they had to go to mess 
 Monday 26 Another fine day, sea very calm. Debating Socy in evening when impromtu speeches were given &amp; a good time spent. 
 Tuesday 27 Fine again but rather hot. One can feel it getting warmer &amp; today being close it is very noticeable. "Warilda" improving in pace. 
 Wednesday 28 Very hot and clothes being discarded.  Buzzer practice  
 Thursday 29 Awnings being put up on boat deck Heat still continuing and sleeping out just the thing.
