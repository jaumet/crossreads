<p>Thursday 1 August 1918<br/>(Diary continued from book completed) "for you call us Sambo? I told him I didn't know, nothing in particular &amp; he said " I don't qualify with that at all, Sambo means a monkey." We were amused. I told him we didn't know that, &amp; I didn't mean to hurt his feelings, he said " It does not matter, it does not worry me, you call me Sambo, I answer just the same, but I don't qualify with it at all," &amp; the coon puffed at a cigarette &amp; put on great swank. One travels &amp; learns alright. I had a good snooze after dinner &amp; am feeling a bit livelier than last night. Fritz 'planes came over &amp; set fire to 4 of our balloons this evening. There is a hayfield in front of our dugout &amp; two women are grafting hard; &amp; stacking it in heaps. Of course our chaps helped themselves to some when they had gone, as a bed for their dugouts. <br/>2 Aug.<br/>Rained all day. <br/>3 Aug,<br/>Had a tooth filled today, the dental party had to go to the 4th Field Ambulance, there was a motor ambulance going there, as it was a long way &ndash; passed through Camon, Longueau &amp; Cagny, all now deserted of their civilian population.</p>
