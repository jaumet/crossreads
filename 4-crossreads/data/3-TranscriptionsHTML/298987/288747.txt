<p>March 1918<br/>when we got orders to put our masks on &amp; go down the road. Most of the show was over by then but we had to hang about for fresh orders (Fortunately we had the cocoa etc with us) Eventually we had to get our blankets &amp; go about a 1 mile to where the remainder of the Company is camped got there about 3 Am &amp; was luckie enough to strike a humpe with a couple of old mates in it &amp; got a good camp for what was left of the night All told 16 men were gassed out of my platoon only 2 or 3 any way severly Cant say I even smelt it.</p>
<p>Monday 18th<br/>Went back to our camp early &amp; had a day off to recuperate</p>
<p>Tuesday 19th<br/>The P;atoon or rather what is left of it went on Bath Parade. An excelent bath &amp; good change of clothes Rained nearly all day the wettest I have seen in this country</p>
