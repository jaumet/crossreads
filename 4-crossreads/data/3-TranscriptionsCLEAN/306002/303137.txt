  
 10.5.15 Mon. 10th.  I have had a bad throat since last Fri. & it has now turned into a cold in the head & as we cannot get medicine on board, it is not improving.  Last night Stan & I slept down a hatchway in the rear of the ship & when we awoke this morning, we were covered in coal-dust, had a lecture on how to dress wounds etc. before dinner & were also cleaning rifles this afternoon.  We passed some small islands before sun-down.  We were issued with cards to send home & retired to bed early.
