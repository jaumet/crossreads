Monday 29th SeptemberLeft Courtrai at 9 am for Calais via Menin - Ypres - [indecipherable] - [indecipherable] - Neun Englise - Steenwerck -Bailleul - Cassel and st Omer. When in st Omer damaged attachment to off rear spring - and when nearing Calais had trouble with water circulation due to defective rubber piping. Could not cross by Train ferry. Instructions received from War Office for Nell to travel as a civilian - not by train ferry. Stayed the night at Terminus Hotel.
Tuesday 30th SeptemberIn morning arranged about crossing. Baker is to cross with car at midnight tonight. Nell & self with Chris by Boulogne packet.  Motored to Bouloge after lunch. Called on Col Wynter at Wimereux. Ascertained Folkstone packed so must stay in Boulogne tonight. Cross tomorrow and have Baker to meet us on the other side. Stayed at Hotel Folkstone. Secured tickets for passage across.
Wednesday 1st OctoberIn morning called at Shipping office and Fish market. Chris much interested in fishing boats etc. In early afternoon in an Australian Car visited the old town. Boulogne - Napoleons monument etc.   Ascended the latter with Chris. Went to ship at 4pm.  Rather a nuisance in obtaining a visa to Nell's passport. Left Boulogne at 6pm arriving in rain at Folkstone about 7.15.   Secured rooms at Metropole Hotel, and found there very comfortable.   Hotel magnificently situated.   Baker met us with car at pier. Railway strike not yet settled and transport very much upset. Many volunteers at work.
Thursday 2nd OctoberLeft Folkstone at 9.15 and motored through to London arriving about 2pm.  Stayed in Canterbury for about an hour to inspect the Cathedral. Very interesting indeed. Arranged for room at Bernier Hotel. Found  Cousin [indecipherable]  already there, tho' he had no knowledge we intended to stay at this hotel. Obtained Correspondence from Horseferry Road
