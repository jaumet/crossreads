 15/8 /19 Chemnitz Although the weather was fine we ran into heavi sea this morn and all the recent recov sea sick peopl soon collaps again . Found on the inspect down in the lower deck the air was thick enough to make one squeamish . There were fewer complaint about food today though bread was one item . New ? that is all that is wrong with it . Some of these complaint are made by crimin and cold footer and make one feel inclin to hurl the offend bread , stew or whatev it is at their miser head . 16/8 /19 Much smoother today . On inspect this morn found all pretti correct . The ship is get veri monoton and we shall not be sorri to reach home . The wind was howl and whistl all night ? a wild night at sea .
