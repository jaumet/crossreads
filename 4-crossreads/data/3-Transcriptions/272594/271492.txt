<p>28th  There was a very heavy bombardment raging all night so I expect there has been a big smash down the line again. Nothing to report today am on "guard" &amp; things are very quiet.  On of our fast new triplanes brought a Taube down lovely yesterday, the plane came down in our lines &amp; a little scouting plane followed her right down to the ground &amp; lit alongside the Taube to take the occupants prisoner I suppose  &amp; to claim the machine.</p>
