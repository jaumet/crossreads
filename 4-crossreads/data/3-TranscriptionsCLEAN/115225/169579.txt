 June 19  th    We went to Ailly.Sur.Somme & Frechencourt on Supplies & on the way home picked up some stuff for Gisele & her mother at Montieres & took them to La Chaussee. Their home was at Mesnil before the war (near Albert) when they had to evacuate they went to Montieres just out from Amiens, since Fritz has been shelling Amiens they stay at La Chaussee, spending the day at their house at Montieres & catching a lorry back to La Chaussee every evening a distance of thirteen kilometres. Frank was enoculated when we got home. we have all to be done as Spanish Flu is prevalent amongst the troops - 
   
 June 20  th    We went to Frechencourt on supplies again & on the way home picked up a load of furniture from a house in the Dutch quarter of Amiens of which we had been given the key, & took it to Picquigny for a Mademoiselle, & they would insist on giving us five francs each which we tried to refuse. & We missed a bonzer job through it too - I picked a bunch of roses coming through Amiens for Zita. I was enoculated when we got back to Park - Jno & I spent the evening as usual.
