<p>15 Decbr. 1914</p>
<p>My dear Car, Joseph, &amp; Kitty:/<br/>Much disappointed at not receive letters from you at Fremantle.  One came from Dr. Paton in reply to mine written to him from Melbourne.  The letter &amp; parcel you sent to catch me on the Saturday am &amp; were reposted and I found them at the ship when I returned from Perth.</p>
<p>We left Fremantle about 8 p.m. on 14-12-14 and are now some one hundred or so miles into the Indian Ocean, with the head of the vessel, I think, directed for Colombo.  On our way we might come within sight of the Cocos Islands, where the Emden was put out of commission by the Sydney.  One of the bright particular spots in the course of the great war up to date.  Our company was increased by some ninety odd officers with rank &amp; file who with us represent Western Australia.  The men were taken for a march through Fremantle for a couple of hours before we set out.</p>
<p>In writing letters for Christmas, I can only think of one person whom I neglected, viz. Mrs.</p>
