<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>We are still here in the mud &ndash; altho it does not happen to be quite as bad to-day, following a slight fall of snow yesterday &amp; the day before &amp; a hard 'freeze up' last night. It took us a couple of days to get settled here &ndash; only stayed three days in our first quarters &amp; then found a larger home among the details. After all its not a bad home &ndash; they feed our lot well and never give us any work. &ndash; A daily route march being about the limit. Got my kit completed to-day &amp; now have everything necessary to a professional hoboe. The clothing board before which we had to appear provided a splendid comic opera &hellip;. the oft repeated woeful tale of shipwreck being the chief comic item. As to our intended movements we know nothing &amp; can say less. No leave so far &ndash; I had a note from Charlie &amp; am wild about not being able to see him &ndash; but its no good kicking here &ndash; they do what they like with you &amp; one remembers that this is A.S. now. However I may be able to have a yarn with the old chap &ndash; as there's a rumor we may get our leave soon &amp; I know where to find him. This climate</p>
