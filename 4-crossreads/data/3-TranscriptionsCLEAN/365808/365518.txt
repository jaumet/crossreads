  
 (2) that I've got a horse and theres plenty of room to move about in - no hole in the ground business. Had a letter from Jaminy Vofan recently, saying Dr Harper was back looking very well. Ron Brin is in college again and Hugh Kirkland also has returned to Australia Dorothy has written me several letters - the last just prior to the expected arrival of the car - what has happened since, I am wondering. I see Caesar has got his majority at last - good luck to him - also that Walter Macallum has his MC - I was damned glad to see both announcements in AIF orders  I wont write any more as theres a good chance of this not reaching you at all & it would be a pity to waste too much good literary stuff Drop me a card when you've time & let me know how you are getting along. Yours very Sincerely R Hunter
