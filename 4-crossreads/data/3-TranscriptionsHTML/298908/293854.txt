<p>All the steamers in the harbour were hung with bunting &amp; blowing their whistles.  I strolled round the Hoe for a while &amp; then went down town again &amp; made out for Devonport, by this time all cars were stopped from running for it was just about impossible for them to push through the crowds so I had to walk out, here I met Starkey &amp; his Yorkshire girl &amp; shortly after met Miss Nissen &amp; we went out to the Theatre Royal to see "The Boy".  The place was crowded &amp; just before the curtain rose the orchestra played &amp; all sung the "Brabaconne" Marseillaise, &amp; God Save the King amidst an almost indescribable scene of enthusiasm, &amp; when we had finished this a naval officer from one of the boxes got up &amp; said "Gentlemen the war is won" &amp; then there was a renewal of cheering &amp; etc.  At last the play got going &amp; during the course of it the actors were constantly getting champagne from the occupants of the boxes, &amp; very nearly got drunk</p>
