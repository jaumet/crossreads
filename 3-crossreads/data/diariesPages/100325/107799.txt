On early parade order read from GOC Sir John Maxwell stating conduct of A NZ troops in recent disturbances was disgraceful a slur on memory of dead. He says complaints are frequent of conduct, assault of women, robbery One soldier under arrest for murder. These actions only those of a very few ? a "push" 
5 pm Left for bivouac in same spot as previously. A Co supplied outpost. Everyone turned in and asleep at 9 pm. Slept very well till 4 o'c when sand got into All arrangements good, men enjoyed the change. Bright starlit night, spent some time with trying to pick out constellations. Nothing like lying out in bivouac to make one notice the stars
