<p>(16) June 25th (Monday)<br/>bone. It is a very painful process.</p>
<p>June 26th<br/>To medico for usual treatment. Capt McKenzie received another parcel, so we were the recipients of more Jam syrup, butter, biscuits which are a great luxury. Played Patience &amp; read books, also had game "Bridge" &amp; thoroughly enjoyed myself, the four consisting of Leickler, Capt McKenzie Dickson &amp; myself. 2 more English officers &amp; 1 Frenchman in our ward today, making 8.</p>
<p>June 27th<br/>Good sleep. To medico again. Had bath again today, my second since being in Germany. Feeling very well. Bought sardines (4 tins) I am laying in a stock to take to camp on account of things being so dear there, &amp; in case my parcels do not arrive for a week or so yet.</p>
<p>Doctor around this afternoon &amp; told me that it would be bet[ter] if I had an operation, so as to have some new flesh put over my ankle, as unless this was done, I would not be able to wear a boot. Played bridge.</p>
<p>June 28th<br/>Good sleep. To medico for "foot exercises &amp; hot air. Good meals today. Capt McKenzie &amp; Frenchman left for "Lager" today leaving 6 of us. Hot today. We will miss McKenzie as he kept us well supplied in foodstuffs from his own private parcels. He is jolly decent chap. He is going to look after my interests at the camp. The name of his ship was the "Brecknockshire".</p>
