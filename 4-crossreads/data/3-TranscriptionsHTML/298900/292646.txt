Lunch at 12.30.   Cup of tea at 4 &amp; dinner at 6.   then a look round the Hospital &amp; either write or try &amp; do some French.   Bed at 10 oclock which allows me to get up at 7 without difficulty.   A lot of leave going through now, men going who were on leave 6 months ago whilst I had to wait full 12 months for mine.  C'est la guerre.</p>

The last week much has happened.   1st the two nursing Sgts arrived back from leave &amp; I handed the Hospital over to them &amp; then before I could dig into the Dispensary the Colonel got me to take charge of the revetting work round the huts.   He was awfully keen on getting it done &amp; gave me about</p>
