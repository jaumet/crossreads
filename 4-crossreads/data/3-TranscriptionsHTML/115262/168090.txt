<p>Monday 19 November 1917.</p>
<p>Smith inspected camels. Got rid of my 2 lead camels as result. Moved again at 1 pm. 5 miles to Surafend<s>a</s>. Passed through hundreds of acres of well kept orange orchards where hundreds of tons of oranges are going to waste on the trees.</p>
<p>28 days for anyone caught taking oranges &amp; lemons from these orchards. People in the villages use Eng<sup>h</sup> money and speak Eng<sup>h</sup> language.</p>
<p>A wet night &amp; on picquet. Got drenched.</p>
