<p>1917<br/>Jany 30<br/>I dont want you sick &ndash; sick man no B -   good worse than dead man &ndash; takes two more men to look after him.   When you get leave come back up to time.   If you dont &ndash; 28 days.   Carry on Sergeant Major.   The Sergeant Major had a bark somewhat similar.   We thought that we would be in for a bad time, and for the first two months our surmise was correct.   All the heads seemed to have had their kindlier feelings frozen solid by the cold.  We were put into huts holding about 30 men each.   Each hut had a stove in the middle.   Each man had five blankets, but even this number left one cold.  Between the rows of huts were the wash houses and latrines.   The wash houses were not in use at this time as the water in the pipes was frozen solid.   [Inserted a photo titled "Huts No 10 Camp Hurdcott".]   I did not get a wash for three days.  Then some wit got a bucketfull of warm water</p>
