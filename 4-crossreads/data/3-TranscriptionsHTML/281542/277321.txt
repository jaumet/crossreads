<p>Tuesday 6th July 1915</p>
<p>A pleasant day on the calm bosom of the Indian Ocean.  A gentle S.W. zephyr did little to disturb the tranquility of the day.  The blue dome above was unflecked by clouds &amp; reflected itself in the unruffled water unsparingly.  <strike>Beyond</strike> A lazy swell, wh to the troops had the effect of a sweet lullaby on a new born child, predominated throughout the day.  One accident marred the day.  We lost our mascot &ndash; Miss Wallaby &ndash; overboard.  Whether this be an ominous sign, we do not know &ndash; at any rate, her loss was soon forgotten wh spells much for the optimism of the troops.</p>
<p>The journey is becoming tiresome in its dull monotonous routine &ndash; deck concerts help one at night to dispel gloomy thoughts.</p>
