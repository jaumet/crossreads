 1916   TUESDAY 26   SEPT. 
 Fine & warm. Revielle at 5.30 and we all paraded in marching order and marched over to Bulford where we joined up with the rest of the 3 rd  Division. A lot of the artillary was mounted with their guns (18 pounders & howitzers). It was a fine sight to see all the mounted artillary & infantry with fixed bayonets marching past and a few aeroplanes over-head flying about. We got back to camp some time after 7 pm a very tired but happy lot. Got a letter from M  â€‹   r  LLoyd dated 23 rd  Aug.
