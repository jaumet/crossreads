<p>Friday 24th November 1916.<br/>At midday the 8th Bearers proceed to the trenches, unfortunately we brought bad wether with us. The front we are working on is a palace when compared with that we wee working on a fortnight ago. Only four Relay Posts &amp; good dug outs at each post. The arrangements regarding ration was also good. Especially the rum issue. Am working in the same squad as Bob Roberts. Fortunately our squad was not called during the night. The night was pitch black &amp; the track not too good for night bearing. In the daytime it is O.K. duck-boards all the way.</p>
<p>Saturday 25th November 1916.<br/>Kept fairly busy all day, a good number of patients coming through our Relay Posts. I was at No. 3 Post which is about 1 &frac12; miles from our front line. Shells flying round our dug outs all day, no very pleasant, one burst about 10 yards from our dug-out, dirt &amp; mud fell on the roof, it gave us a bit of a shock. Pouring with rain all day very often we had to bale our home out. About midnight a patient came along for our squad. It was a dreadful carry, it was impossible to see 10 yards ahead &amp; I often fell over tipping patient &amp; stretcher into the mud. The duck boards are only about 2 feet wide &amp; if we miss a step it is 10 to [need to check original] that over we go into the mud. In some places the mud on each side of the boards was waist deep, we had to go very slowly on account of this. Arrived at the next post at 2 a.m. in the day-</p>
