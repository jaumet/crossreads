<p>At Sea                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 5.5.15.<br/>My dearest Mother  &amp;  Sisters,<br/>Suppose you have received my letter from Thursday Is. safely. I am longing for news from home, it seems ages since we heard how the war is progressing &amp;  how you all are.<br/>We expect to reach Colombo next Saturday 8th May. Hope to go ashore &amp;  stayed until Tuesday-morning. If we can catch a train, we are off to Kandy for 24 hrs. The Major  &amp; Matron are going with us. Oh, to be on land once more. We have not left the boat since we embarked.<br/>We have had a wonderfully calm passage but plenty of heat, in the Torrid Zone most of the time &amp; a state if moisture. Have had a cool breeze these last two days. I have not been sea sick but enjoying my food &amp; putting in time very well. I had to look after Dorothy for a few days while her throat was bad. She is splendid again &amp; her voice beautiful. We are still having the two Concerts a week, the Church services, &amp; sports for the me. The Sisters' Sports were a failure<br/></p>
