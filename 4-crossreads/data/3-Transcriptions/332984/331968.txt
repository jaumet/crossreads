<p>27.9.1916   Nice fine sunny day.  Hun plane over this morning, dropped a bomb on a shed in Poperinghe, where a number of our Infantry were billited.  This bomb was a dud.  Two heavy Btys passed this way last night.  Heard that Combles and Thiepval were captured.  Combles is a great railway junction</p>
<p>28.9.1916   A lot of shooting going on.  Nothing startling</p>
<p>29.9.1916   Raining last night.  Went to Reninghelst last evening.  Went to a hairdressers shop, the barber was drinking beer, I left.  Terrific Artillery shooting.  Stopped raining, terrebly foggy.  Some heavy guns in action, not far from our wagon lines.  Horses are looking</p>
