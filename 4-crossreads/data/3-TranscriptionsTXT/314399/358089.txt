Wednesday 2 April 1919Lovely day once more. Was dusty in town tho. didn't hit camp till 11 pm. Bill &   I went out to St.Addresse [Adresse] & sang a bit. Had a very quiet night altogether.
Tuesday 3 April 1919Lovely day again. Met Moffitt, Carmichael, Bruce Oliver & Bruce Sloan. Went & had a look at a game of soccer which was cruel. Was in charge of trains again. Things were very quiet tho. Had to meet a V.A.D. but she didn't turn up but her pal did & explained matters.
