but at 2PM we were fallen in again and taken in motor wagon to B [Indecipherable] "Southland". She was a fine ship to look at but our quarters in the 3rd class were not too good. They were very hot and stuffy and I elected to stay on deck in a horse stall.
A cosmopolitan place like Alexandria is full of intrigue etc.
The Southland was really named "Vaderland" [Fatherland] a Belgium ship and had good quarters in the 1st & 2nd class. I had a good opportunity to survey the Eastern Harbour of Alexandria which was full of craft. It was a very warm day as we left. I spent to day [Indecipherable] expecting to find we would be out at sea by morning.
Tuesday 15thWe were still at the wharf at daybreak. Anchor was weighed about 8 o'clock. I was overjoyed to think we had at last started. It was dreadfully hot.
