<p>My dear Lady<br/>For weeks past I've intended posting you a few lines, but it is so late when I get home &amp; I have so little time that my letter-writing gets behind.<br/>By now I suppose you are happily settled at home and feel as if you had hardly been away.  Mer. &amp; I are wondering what your future plans are, if you will settle permanently now or you and the Major be returning?  I often look up to "The Flat" when passing &amp; think of our pleasant visits there.<br/>The personnel of the Hospital has changed much, only a very few</p>
