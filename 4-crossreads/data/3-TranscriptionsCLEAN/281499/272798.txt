  
 now this is very much against the Army rule's for we are never supposed to be without them day or night  I was hurrying down the trench & I bumped into a 3rd Batt. officer he spots me without the helmet, & pulls me up & asked me where my helmet was  I answered him readily although I was taken by surprise, what Coy. do you belong to was his next question & I told him so I did but not of his Batt, well he said don't let me catch you without it again & off he walked. .As soon as we arrived here last night Len & another chap named  Gilligan  WATMAN had a fight, it appears  Gilligan  WATMAN called him a B- & Len into him & knocked him out in a couple of rounds it was an easy victory.
