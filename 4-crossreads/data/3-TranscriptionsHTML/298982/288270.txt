<p>Ten minutes before full of health &amp; vigour next the relics of a man. War is pretty sure enough &amp; picturesque to those who sit at home &amp; write about it from their office chair or study.

They were blown up with putrifying gases faces to the sun We had a hot 15 min while the NZs on our left made as we heard</p>
