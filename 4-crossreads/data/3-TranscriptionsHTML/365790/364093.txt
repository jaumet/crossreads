<p>seldom made their unwelcome visits.  Work could therefore be carried out much easier &amp; with less strain than before.  Trenches leading to the front system were first taken in hand &amp; put in good repair &ndash; duckwalk construction &ndash; screens put up to0 hide movement &ndash; trench tramways maintained &ndash; and as these works were cleared up more &amp; more attention was given to the main roads in the forward areas.  A saw mill plant was run at [Luidenhoek?] where a large quantity of timber was cut for the division.  The battalion too was excellently quartered &amp; a fair amount of respite was given.  The conditions were therefore good &amp; contrasted very much with what the Battalion had experienced the previous year on the Somme.  On Dec 15th the whole unit moved with the rest of the Divn for a thorough rest to Hesdigneul; a small village 8 miles south of Boulogne, on the main railway line.  Here liberal leave to Boulogne was available &amp; everyone led a life of comparative ease.  An excellent Xmas was [indecipherable] spent &amp; the battalion band, which had only recently been formed, began to make its presence heard.<br/>At the end of January the battalion returned to its old camps in the Messines area &amp; returned to former tasks.  By the middle of <strike>February most of the</strike> March the whole of the roads in the neighbourhood of Messines which had previously been impassable were open for traffic &amp; were much made use of.  A large number of entrenched strong posts were built &amp; miles of barbed wire constructed. Early in March however the enemy shelling became more active &amp; on March 21st the storm burst further south which closed for the battalion activities in this sector.  Orders were received on that day to withdraw all detached parties &amp; to have everyone in readiness for any emergency.  On March 26th the Battalion moved to Reninghelst on the first stage of its journey to the scene of the German attack.</p>
