1d each for a large Mug of Tea & sat down & finished our Tea, the whole lot costing us 3 francs & 5d each, Anyhow that is the last time I intend having Tea in Poperinghe. The style there does not suit me. After a quiet stroll until 8 Pm we started on our return journey, but tried another Road, we followed a Train line along a narrow street walking along the sides on a pathway of ashes & it turned into a wide road although the Traffic there is also Heavy one could walk along in comfort, we kept going for about 1 mile & eventually arrived at a point where the line crosses our line & we turned & followed our line into Camp although it is a little farther but still when the roads are bad it is the best. After getting into Camp we made ourselves a cup of cocoa each & having some of the Ginger Cake left we had a nice supper, & eventually turned into bed. We had only been in bed a few minutes when an alarm was given of Gas, the Hooters & Engine Whistles & Bells ringing soon aroused every body, the alarm is for all hands to be on the alert, that is place our Gas respirators on our chest, opened & ready to put the mask
