<p>20/9/17 Canal Area. Ypres<br/>The 5th. &amp; 7th. Bdes. attacked at dawn under cover of a tremendous bombardment which did not sound as loud as we expected here but was doubtless well heard further back. The assault was launched at 5.40 a.m. The aircraft were like bees flying very low. The cannonade settled down to a steady level before 8 am at which time the 23rd. Battn started to move up to near the Lille Gate in platoons. We settled down to issue of extra ammunition rations and water and got ready to move at 9.40. The rain during the night had not affected us much here beyond making the ground soft and sticky and the morning is a showery looking one with gleams of sun. That there should have been rain at all at this juncture after so much fine weather goes to affirm the superiority of the German God to ours! News through at 9.20 that our people are definitely on the blue line with very little fighting at 8 o'c and captured 130 prisoners. Big counter attack expected at 10 am.</p>
