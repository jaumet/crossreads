Dear GrandfatherMum said I could write you a letter just to tell you we have a new teacher her name is Miss Hawkes she came yesterday.  She asked me this morning was my Uncle killed at the war.  She had two brothers at the war and one was killed in the same battle as Uncle Terence.  The other brother wrote a letter to her and said Uncle Terence was the finest officer in France.  In one of the big battles he walked up and down between the guns and wasn't afraid of the shells.
