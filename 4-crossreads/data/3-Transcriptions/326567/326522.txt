<p>a loud report then a rumbling sound as the Shells travel away over the Lines.<br/>Monday 23rd/7/17<br/>At 3 am this morning Fritz was over again, but this time I did not stir I simply sat up &amp; put my Steel Helmet &amp; lit a Cigarette &amp; had a smoke &amp; listened to the play outside after awhile things quietened again &amp; I dosed off &amp; slept until 7 am, feeling tired as I had very little sleep all night. <strike>Tuesd</strike> <br/>Friday 27/7/17<br/>After a quiet morning the Bombardment increased in violence &amp; continued practically all night, word came from the Front line this evening that Fritz has cleared back 3 or 4 miles but our Lads are not advancing for a while as a trap may be set for them anyhow we are pummelling his Trenches to make sure We can guage how things are advancing by our Observation Balloons. <strike>Saturday 28th</strike> As soon as it got dark this Evening &amp; as the sky is clear Fritz came over in his aeroplane, you can hear his Engine, Search lights were up in all directions looking</p>
