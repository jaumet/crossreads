<p>Mr H. Wright <br/>Mitchell Librarian</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<br/>Under separate cover I am sending my war diary by registered packet post, which I hope you shall receive in good order.<br/>You will note that I have had my manuscript typewritten and that it now comprised 41 pages. <br/>Hoping to receive a favourable reply from you in due course.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours in anticipation</p>
