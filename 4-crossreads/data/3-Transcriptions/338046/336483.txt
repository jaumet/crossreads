<p>1917<br/>March<br/>the biting cold for two hours, but waited in a hut warmed by a stove.  Men were sent to hospital at the least sign of sickness.   I had three days "no duty" when I returned.<br/>March. 18.  On Sunday 18th March, Tom McCann Cameron and I walked to Wilton.   My feet were a bit tender, as I had not done any walking to speak of for a month.  We had a feed and then walked along the Salisbury road but did not go too far as it was necessary to have a pass to get beyond Wilton.   [Photo inserted titled "Road to Wilton via Burcombe"].   Then we set out for Wilton Church (after having another feed).   This church was built by the Pembroke family and has a very fine campanile.   One of its peculiarities is that it has about 900 pillars of various sizes and the capital of each pillar is carved differently. The campanile is built away    [Photo inserted titled "West St Wilton looking toward Hurdcott"].</p>
