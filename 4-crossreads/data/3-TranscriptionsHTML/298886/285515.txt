<p>Everyone was up and doing and all prepared to leave the troopship. The deafening cracking of machine guns and rifles and the duller sounds of hand grenades and artillery fire were as heavy as the night before. The landing place looked most formidable and I should have thought it impossible to effect a landing in such a rough spot. To the right of Anzac lay the low lying beach of Gaba Tepe but we found out that that particular inviting looking place was one mass of wire entanglements even for many yards out in the water. And to the left again stretching towards Suvla Bay was level ground. And it has since struck me as remarkable that they did not land there. However no time for moralizing "First Light Horse get down the gangway on to the torpedo Boat destroyer" was the order. 1st Light Horse to go first. That was good news as for my part I had no particular desire to go ashore so early and in the rain Besides I wanted to get some breakfast before going that is Bully Beef</p>
