 SATURDAY, JANUARY 11, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; cold. Knocking round 
 with Alan all day. Tommy 
 Fenwicke gave a party at night 
 and about a dozen of us 
 had dinner at the Pic &amp; went 
 on to &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; after. We 
 had a box there, &amp; we livened 
 the show up a bit. 
 Poss Nivison arrived over 
 on his way home to Aussie.
