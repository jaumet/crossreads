<p>The tucker here is rather good, but the flies are absolutely awful.</p>
<p>So far this is the extent of my news, but I think you will see that things have not been too slow.</p>
<p>If Mother is sending anything over at all, please tell her to include papers and envelopes.  Address as usual to Egypt.</p>
<p>Hope you are keeping a good supply of news coming this way and also reading matter.</p>
<p>Tell the whole bloomin' staff to write.</p>
<p>Love to all at home.<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Pte 1280 Roy Richards.</p>
