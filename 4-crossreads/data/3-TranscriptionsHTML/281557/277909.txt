<p>in No Mans land: one of our patrols bumped one of Fritz's I think: a heavy bombardment round Yres has been on for a few days. Took a "P" bert writing &amp; self observing:</p>
<p>Monday June 12th <br/>trenches: showery all day: usual shells: got a letter from J.B.J. J.O.Donnel. &amp; anne &amp; Jack: They were very acceptable &amp; newsy: told off for wire work but it did not come off: warned that the 1st Bgde were having a "stunt" &amp; to be prepared for artillery fire: about 11.45 pm heavy rifle &amp; machine gun fire was on round that way: it was raining &amp; bitterly cold all day:</p>
<p>Tuesday June 13th <br/>trenches: showery bitterly cold all day: at 12.25 am the artillery opened up: Fritz sent up his red flares &amp; also some green "showers" but his guns were a little while in replying: we only got the tail end some "whizz" &amp; shrapnel: most of the time we were looking over the parapet &amp; it was a nice sight: D. Coy lost a few men: poor old Fritz is getting a shake up lately but he started these games &amp; is getting paid in his own coin: These Aust's are undoubtedly hard doers: when anyone gets killed it is just a passing comment "poor B---" or some other phrase: read an account of the 7th raid &amp; the men are now in London on leave: Bert got a parcel &amp; we had a "beano":- pudding, tinned fruit &amp; lollies which went very good: went out "Listening" 9.30 pm till 11.45 pm &amp; it was a wet &amp; miserable job:</p>
