<p>22/7/18<br/>Perth &ndash; Pilochtry [Pitlochry]<br/>fair town of Perth about 3 pm and changed into the "local" for Pitlochtry. Put up here at Frazers Hotel surrounded by lovely garden. This place is lovely, the air fresh and bracing. Before dinner walked along out to the Pass of Killiecrankie crossing the Tummell [Tunnel] river. High peaks forest covered on either side of the road and neat rim cottages here and there. This is wild Highland scenery. It was raining but with coats on it did not matter and we thoroughly enjoyed as delightful a walk as one could well make. At dinner at the hotel there were not a great many people and afterwards the Colonel &amp; I sat in the smoking room and yarned over whisky and soda. Retired to bed at a little before 11 and slept well.</p>
