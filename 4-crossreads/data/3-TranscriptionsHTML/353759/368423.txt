<p>French and English.  That we were Australians surprised them.</p>
<p>With the last crowd through stiffness had set in:  they"d captured the 5 men and machine guns of one of our strong points and then been captured themselves.  Altogether Fritz"s two counter attacks this morning early disastrous failures and a getting back from the 5th casualties of their hop over late in February.  Had a tin of beans at about 5 and turned in at 9 and duty.  Till now I am 3rd, only two through, one of the 5th and a F.A. chap from the batteries over the D.S. at F. corner.  The night quiet.</p>
<p>37<br/>This book I"d thought to finish with notes on 10 days Blighty &ndash; that was three months ago.</p>
<p>38  March 3<br/>Slept whole of latter part of morning 2 a.m. till 8 a.m. &ndash; breakfast &ndash; and a tour of the evacuated country again with Clarrie"s souvenir hunting:  bag &ndash; a Fritz cap, muddy and bloody, shot through front rim and one of thousands of flares, only one full brass case.  Back at Edwards about 3.30, dinner of munchies and Beans, and turned in at 4.30 till 7.30.  Duty.  Sick through only till just before midnight, and then Syd. brought in Macdonald &ndash; knocked just outside No.2 Relay &ndash; where he"d gone today to relieve Perkins &ndash; knocked in the back of his head and part of brain protruding.  Called up the Major, dressed him and sent him down to Bazentin.  Squad left him at cough drop still alive but unconscious.  Shell that got him or tear gas shell:  since 9th Fritz had been putting them over, and the air still full of the tear gas.</p>
<p>Opposite No. 1 Relay &ndash; where Fritz once had one of his whizz bang batteries got a good case:  as a holder for flannel flowers, we"ll polish, it"d look great.  The day"s been quiet and the night comparatively so.  Poor old Mac &ndash; an original &ndash; I think of 1st G.H. No. 144 and only this morning had said that "they can"t get me".</p>
<p>39<br/>Tonight Ern cut my hair &ndash; not before it needed it.  [indecipherable] 1 in 4th, two of the 3rd chaps on duty squad are swapping tents.</p>
<p>This time last year &ndash; the early part of March we were clearing out Ghezireh Palace, packing for an unknown destination.  April next I"ll have been 12 months in France, 3 at Marseille, 6 Boulogne, 3 in the field.</p>
<p>40  March 4<br/>In the night continuous bombardments both sides:  no cases through after 1 a.m.  Slept in.  Bill knocked in thigh &ndash; same shell that killed Mac &ndash; poor beggar died at C.C.S., the wonder is that he got that far.  Makes casualties to date 3 slightly remaining on duty:  1 slightly shell shocked:  three badly knocked and evacuated, and two, the Colonel and Mac killed.</p>

<p>41  March 5<br/>Quiet night. Slept till midday.  2nd &amp; 3rd relieved, we all from Edwards to F. Corner.  Hunt asked me to Batman for him, decided to, but on understanding it was only till we were relieved.  Clarrie and Mon permanent Gas Guard.</p>
