Half an hour later we were digging on the rise and at regular intervals "whiz-bangs" whistled low over our heads and fell just behind in the marshy piece of ground called Ypres plain. After digging down about three feet and unearthing a decayed Fritz (as could be seen by the clothing) I considered that a smoke might lessen the smell and awful sick feeling, so I said to my mate "Give us a cig." For answer he shouted "Look out" An ominous rushing whistling sound at our backs, a flash, a hot, blinding rush of air in my face and I was thrown by the concussion, several yards along the trench where I lay on my back, speechless. Presently I sat up "W...What are you g..grimy at?" said I And he replied "At you you look so comical" "I feel comical too" said I. If that had been a few inches left, I suppose I would have been left too. Got a match? My mate pointed to where it had exploded, near where my feet had been That one was the first but it was sufficient for I always ducked as soon as I heard them coming afterwards, the same as everyone else, not waiting for their arrival.

We were just behind the attacking troops.
