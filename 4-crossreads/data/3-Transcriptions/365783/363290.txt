<p>an ante dated cheque dated 20th November. Please let Arch know this as there will be no corresponding butt in the cheque book for it. The decks of our poor ship are at present black with coal dust &amp; things are anything but comfortable. I have been feeling real well except for a cracked lower lip (too fond of the girls etc.) Had a few words with Fred this morning &ndash; he has lost his voice but is otherwise quite well &ndash; he says he is comfortable enough. I went out to Broadmeadows a few days ago &amp; had dinner &amp; spent the evening with Uncle Joe. He is very proud of his command &amp; seems quite happy &amp; jovial. There are 11000 men camped there at present.</p>
