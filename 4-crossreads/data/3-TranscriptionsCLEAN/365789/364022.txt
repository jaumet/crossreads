. . . . ."Wasn't it a great pity about poor Fred Phillips.  I said Goodbye to him on the 1st November in the trenches on the Somme opposite Bapaume, our Battalion was being relieved that night to have a sleep as we had not had one for four days.
On the 4th November our Battalion attacked at midnight, in the rain, a strong point about 600 yards away - it was bristling with machine guns & our Battalion was driven back four times, the last seen of Fred as far as I can gather, was that he was wounded & bandaging one of his own machine gunners 40 yards from the German trenches,"
