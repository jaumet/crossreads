<p>2nd Appel is at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Mon. 8th Apl. (cont.)<br/>To resume yet again:-</p>
<p>After dinner the Old Inhabitants usually play Bridge, but we new arrivals are too busy wondering when &amp; for where our marching orders will be.</p>
<p>Tue. 9th Apl.<br/>While walking under the trees this morning the General actually noticed humble me!  Further, he walked with me for about half an hour and chatted must amiably.</p>
<p>My Mess looked on in Awe and when the old boy buzzed off they wanted to know all he said, how he said it, &amp; why he said it.</p>
<p>I replied indifferently that he "just talked", in a tone that indicated that it was quite a usual custom of mine to take constitutionals with Generals.</p>
<p>In the evening I was again Observed by a Personage.   Lt. Colonel Howard Bury (K.R.R.) walked for an hour or two in the evening with me.</p>
