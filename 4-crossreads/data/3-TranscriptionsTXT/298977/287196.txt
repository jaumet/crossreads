 DARDANELLES, 23rd October 1915. 
 My dear Mother. 
 Just another try to fill up a page on nothing.  News has absolutely come to a dead end now.  Still going strong etc., now end of ninth week here. 
 Winter is just about coming on now and we are not looking forward to it very keenly.  It promises to be very cold but luckily we have two blankets each and a comfortable dug out, so we ought not to do too bad. 
 Expect Charlie over here any day now.  Believe they are in Egypt now. 
 Met a couple of old Grammar Boys this morning, rather a pleasant surprise. 
 Have just about used up the contents of the last parcel and am now anxiously waiting for the next. 
 Expect by the time you get this you will all be getting ready for Christmas.  Mine this year will be under very different conditions to the last one.  Hope you sent me along that cake etc. 
 Hope every body at home and round about is O.K.  Remember me to everyone I know and wish them all the Compliments of the Season for me. 
 Will try and think out some news by next mail.  This is rather in a hurry. 
 Love to all Your loving Son, Pte 1280 Roy Richards. 
 Father's letter arrived last mail, will answer shortly. 
 R.R.
