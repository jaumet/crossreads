<p>[Drawing of "The Neck".]</p>
<p>18th-19th-20th-21st</p>
<p>Two fair days out of four the daily programme being a ride or walk out in the mornings to a position on Plugge's Plateau which commands a fine view of the "Sphinx" and a razor edged neck of sandy clay ridge which runs up to Russells Top a plateau which on the sea side ends at the Sphinx and on the landward side goes on &amp; up to the Neck.  In this morning's possie I sit perched up on the edge of what you would call a precipice and wait for the Sun to shine occasionally getting in a dash now and again.  My bad temper is kept under by the presence of a Dinkum Australian but by the Hughes-James Camp, <strike>close by</strike></p>
