<p>Prospects of an early move now as we have commenced to strike our tents, the North being our probable destination.  Have just finished the last of four books I had sent to me some time ago, "The Heart of Midlothian," "Confessions of an English Opium Eater," "Origin of Species" Diary of Samuel Pepys, and have thoroughly enjoyed the four &amp; have gained much from the reading.<br/>Monday 23rd July.<br/>  Still in the same place but our move is now much closer, 3 or 4 days should see us on the move.  Am having a busy time as my partner is on leave in Paris &amp; all the packing up etc falls to me.  Had a good day in Amiens last week &amp; saw more of the town than before visiting the Art Gallery, Town Hall etc.  Main items of the day were a hot bath, &amp; two good feeds.  Still no mail &amp; have received the information that the last was sunk so our luck was out.  A new Dental unit attached for a few days brought to light some friends of 12 months ago when in "Estairs."</p>
