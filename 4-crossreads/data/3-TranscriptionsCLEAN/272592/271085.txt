The following is a parody" on "Sing me to Sleep" & is a great favorite among the boys
Sing me to sleep, the bullets fallLet me forget the war & allDamp is my dugout cold is my feetNothing but biscuits & bully to eat
Far far from Pozeries I want to beWhere German snipers can't pot at meThink of me crouching where the worms creepWaiting for shrapnel to sing me to sleep
Refrain
Sing me to sleep where bombs explodeAnd shrapnel shells are &agrave; la modeOr the sand bags in front of me behind me you'll findCorpse's in front of you corpses behind
Refrain
