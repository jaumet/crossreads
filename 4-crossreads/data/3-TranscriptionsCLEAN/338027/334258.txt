  
 Tuesday, 20 October, 1914 I awoke with a bad attack of neuralgia & it made me feel very miserable.  The weather was beautiful & the sea as calm as a mill pond. 
 We saw a lot of whales & one spouted within a few yards of the ship. 
 I had up till this been sleeping on deck & caught a nasty cold in consequence determined to go below. 
 Wednesday, 21 October, 1914 
 My cold got worse and stables in the morning was a dreary job to me. 
 We started to exercise horses, which has to be done in calm weather.  It is an awkward job & a dangerous one. 
 I got kicked in the front of the thigh and was knocked against one of the rails.  The result was a bruised back.  I played poker at night & lost but felt too bad to play on. 
 We were paid 1 ships pay to day.
