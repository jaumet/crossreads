<p>Thursday 30 [29] August 1917 [1918]<br/>Col. Fetherston [Featherstone] visits 31st &amp; inspects Sisters in their quarters &ndash; promises perhaps 3 wks. leave in England!  I, while waiting for Brid. Gen. Onslow, encounter Miss Gemmell in hall.  Soundly attacked on my attire.  "<u>Must not</u> wear white frocks" etc.  On returning from lovely drive to Mardi she practically takes it all back &amp; grants permission to wear them!  Never have I been addressed in such a manner as this lady uses.  Marliesh!<br/>4 p.m. tea Shepheard's &amp; am asked to become mascot for B. Gen. Onslow's new brigade.</p>
