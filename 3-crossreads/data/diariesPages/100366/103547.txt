 
through Acheux Ourville & several other places & are now bivouacked at Orvilleu which is about 2 miles from Doullens. It is great to be away from the front I can tell you & I will sleep more peacefully tonight than I have done for several weeks.
Later â€“

I did not have the sleep I intended to have as at the last moment I decided to go into Doullens so hopping up onto a motor I got a ride in . After having a look round I decided to return home & found that I could not get a conveyance of any kind. So subsequently had to foot it, a good 6 metres. It was rotten. Doullens is a Ville of 10000 inhabitants very prettily situated on the banks of the Somme . It has been a town of importance years ago & has castles with moats round them like olden days. I tell you it is great to get back into civilization again. We entrain for the north at 10.30 tomorrow night.

8.9.16 Friday
We moved on from Orvills to Anviliere tonight & commenced entraining
