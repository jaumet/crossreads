<p>Left Aussie 18th Nov 1915 "SS Persic"<br/>Arrived Egypt 20th Dec 1915<br/>S Royal Sgt.<br/>4th Aus. Div Train</p>
<p>Diary<br/>Saturday 13/5/16<br/>Serapeum Egypt</p>
<p>My reason for not commencing a diary before was because life in Egypt is so monotonous when not actually on Service as we are now.</p>
<p>We left Polygon Camp Abassia last Tuesday &amp; arrived here early Wednesday morning with difficulties facing us from the jump. The sand here is very fine &amp; the wagons sank nearly box deep in it. Extra horses had to be pitched on &amp; then numerous spells were necessary before the hard road was reached. The lead horses were then taken out &amp; returned to the Station</p>
