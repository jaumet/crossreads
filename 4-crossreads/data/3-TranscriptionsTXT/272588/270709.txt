 Monday 20 May Summer weather still continues &amp; is simply glorious. We were relieved this evening &amp; while we were coming out the Bosch gave us a hail of gas &amp; H.E. shells. Now back at H.Q. near Hazebrouck. 
 Tuesday 21 May Down here, at Hazebrouck we lead the simple life and get round all day in shorts playing cricket &amp; croquet.  Bathing every morning after a mile run. Still glorious weather.
