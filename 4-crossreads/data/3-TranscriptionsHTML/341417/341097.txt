<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>Since last I wrote we have had very calm weather with great heat the juice simply pours off you &amp; makes grease spots on the deck.<br/>The Coast Line from Aden is very Barren sand as far as the eye can see &amp; huge mountains of sand. The H.M.S. Black Prince bombarded a Turkish fort near the Island of Perim &amp; demolished it they intended having a pot shot at the transports as they passed there are 40 ships in the fleet of Transports. I may say when we passed the place we had our Glasses on the fort &amp; there were large holes in the Sides also the roof was blown off &amp; the Fortifications were all demolished &amp; the garrison fled for their natural.<br/>Later on we passed the Island of Perim &amp; then passed through a place called Hells Gate &amp; the Twelve Apostles which are huge rock formations on the coast of Africa. We are now very close to the Suez &amp; then it will not be long before we are on land again as we are going</p>
