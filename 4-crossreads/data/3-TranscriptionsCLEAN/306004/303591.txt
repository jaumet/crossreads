9.11.16Thurs 9thThis morning an enemy 'plane came over again & our Anti Air-Craft guns at Bir-El-Mazar done some exceptionally good shooting apparently doing some damage as the 'plane dropped her bombs at random & made back over her own lines This morning I fixed up a phone in the CO's & Adjutants shelters; 12 miles of wire & 6 'phones to each Regt was issued yesterday; It is reported that we are to attack the Turks 7 miles this side of El-Arish on the 17th of this month; I brought along a set of gloves with me & they earned some good amusement this evening the ground is hard here in the Hod & good for boxing
