<p>Out of the proffits of the Canteen has enabled me to buy a Mosquito Net for everybody in the Summer.  An electric plant worth &pound;150 has been installed, wich has cost the Governement not a penny.  I hawe made use of special capacity of 3 Austrianes who are skilled in charcoal burning.  The result of this is that the expenditure of from 4-5 Pounds Sterling per night on petrol has been reduced to 1 shilling for a bucket of charcoal.

I hawe made sufficient money out of my dry Canteen at the G.C.C. to put in 5 large stoves wich cost 550 Sterling.  These will cook for 3500 men.  They are in properly build Kitchens, &amp; there are hot water boilers.  I never saw the equal of cooking wich is done out ther for men.  They get exactly the same rationes as to Australian Soldiers, but I am shure they get fully 20 per cent more out of rationes.  They use 3 times as many dishes, as the Australian.  The rationes they get are those providet for by the Hague Convention.

It is a lie about "sunshine all day" inside of our</p>
