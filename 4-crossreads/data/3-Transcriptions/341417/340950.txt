<p>Dear Miss King</p>
<p>Your ever welcome letter of the 10th of march safely to hand and I was very pleased to hear from you again. In fact I am always proud of your nice letters and I am only sorry I cannot write such nice letters to you. I used to be a great letter write in peace time but now it is war and we do not get much time especially at present as we have been very busy keeping the Huns back and were just the ones to do it.<br/>I suppose you have read of our wonderful doings lately</p>
