<p>Oct. 12th<br/>A rainy day during which the "Church of Eu" is visited. A never to be forgotten evening &ndash; "The Buskers".</p>
<p>Oct. 13th (Sabbath)<br/>News of another move &ndash; But why so soon? &ndash; Probably to-morrow. That will make  "three in one week".<br/>Splendid news from all fronts &ndash; Cyril (one of our oldest members) leaves our ranks and takes up a position of importance and trust in Camp Commandant's Office.</p>
