1915Oct. 22 Fri.At 3 p.m. Went off for a tour of inspection of the Tombs of  the Khalifs & Mamelukes near the Mokattam Hills & then walked through the Dead City.After tea 4 of us went out to Mena - secured donkeys - and went for a ride on the desert behind the Sphinx & Pyramids. It was great!  Everything flooded in moonlight. The Nile looks jolly good with the moonlight shining on it. The Pyramids reflected in the water on the flats.
