 In one of your letter you spoke of the state of thing at home . . I refer to the Referendum and other matter of which you spoke . Well I dont think Aussi was the onli place where Politician want comb out , and their method of Govern Inquir into , at the time you wrote Blighti Politician were in a pretti mess I was talk to Mr H. one might about our own Politician , and compar their old Platform with the Blighti Politician Idea of Law make and Govnt general . Mr. H. seem to consid our Politician method , a bit cleaner and far more sensibl than the method and Idea of British Politician he has absolut no time for the present day Politician , and consid them to be parasit of the worst class .
