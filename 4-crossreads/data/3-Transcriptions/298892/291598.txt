<p>opportunity of seeing some more of the largest city in the world. I must say I am not greatly enamoured of it all the same, although we soldiers are treated everywhere we go as privileged and welcome visitors. Clubs are open specially for our use everywhere and all kinds of amusements and entertainments are provided specially for us.<br/>Certainly some of Londons old buildings are wonderful monuments but give me Sydney for beauty, every time. I was considering a trip to Ireland but on reflection had decided that it would be wiser not to go just at present on account of the state of feeling there.</p>
<p>I came across an extract in the "Evening News" from the "Times" giving a very good account of our work at the front. The original article was written by Lord Northcliffe and is entitled "the War Doctors". As I daresay you are frequently confronted with questions as to what our real work is at the front and where we are located I am enclosing the cuttings. I regret that I am unable to to procure the original article in the "Times". As we are such a small Detail, only four men and a Corporal, we had trouble ourselves in finding what our position and work was and I was glad to come across this elucidation of the problem. We are with the R.M.O. (Regimental Medical Officer) and his stretcher bearers in the R.A.P.<br/>(Regimental Aid Post).</p>
