<p>4.  By</p>
<p>4.  By travelling 1st. class I was enabled to meet men with whom I had departmental business;  the result of these meetings was advantageous to the work of the Department.</p>
<p>In one case I managed to get facilities from Mr Wilkinson, Crosswood Estate Agent, for bridge building Maenthur Wood and other advantages connected with this Working.</p>
<p>In another case I met the Military Representative of this District and the R.O. and in these interviews settled matters which would have been carried forward almost interminably by correspondence.</p>
<p>If however the rule is a hard and fast one, then please deduct difference.</p>
