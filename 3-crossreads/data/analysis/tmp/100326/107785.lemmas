 28/9/15 after have it onc . Have tie grappl iron on to rocket and are go to fire it to see how far it will carri the iron . After the experi we will fire it over at Abdul and then all hand on to the rope to pull his entangl in with the grappl iron . What a joke if it goe over their trench and they catch hold of the end and pull too . A tug of ( real ) war ! The rocket experi a failur , went the wrong way owe to the weight be uneven balanc and land down in the ravin . It seem a job for a dare man and a dark night ? fix it on the entangl . Aeroplan up while Turk artilleri fire , seem to signal result of shot by a gun carri in the ?plane . Probabl machin gun . One of our last night came veri low over them about 0000 and they let go a furious fusillad of rifl fire . [ Transcrib by Gail Gormley and John Stephenson for the State Librari of New South Wale ]
