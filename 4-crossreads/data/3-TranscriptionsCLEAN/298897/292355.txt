 Friday 25th Went into 'Hazebrouck' for drugs & in order to take an officer to the eye hospital.  Had a couple of hours there & drove the car back having dinner in "Merville" arriving back shortly after two, altogether a decent morning as a change.  More rain late in the afternoon.  Had a note from M.D. saying alls well with a P.S. which said - "The military now assess my services at two thirds higher value than formerly" meaning that he had been made a Corporal.  Will see him with [indecipherable] shortly if the huns leave him on his feet. 
 Saturday 26th August. Orderly Sergeant for the day.  General duties throughout the day.  At night went down to the Gas school to gather information.  Learnt among other things that the casualties through a gas attack about a fortnight ago numbered 1000 with 300 deaths.  They managed to catch our fellows charging over & unprepared all packed together.  The officers responsible for such a state of thing were punished.
