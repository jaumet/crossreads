Turned out rather early and had all Coy. Comdrs down at 9 a.m. for orders. Fritz started shelling fairly close and soon Cpl. Robinson was badly wounded one arm broken and one leg shattered and a nasty mud filled wound in the fce. The shell burst between him and another man who escaped unhurt. All ankle boots were called in and stacked in dump near Needle. Arranged all details of rations etc with Pedler. During the day enemy shelling continued brisk and in the evening another man was wounded (slightly) and another killed. He was blown about badly body torn and face blown off. His mates buried him and handed in a riddled pocket book in which was a letter addressed to his wife "in case anything should happen to me". At 1.30 our Lewis guns and 1 off. per Coy had gone on ahead and at 5.15 the remainder set out and picked up guides at the Cow dump. Two of these guides were killed coming down and their officer wounded. Followed on ourselves and made for the HQ
