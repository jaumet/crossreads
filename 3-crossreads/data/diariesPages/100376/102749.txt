About eight o'clock this morning we quietly moved off. So quietly did we sail out that we were well into the Gulf before we were aware of it.
A sickly and crowded deck is the result of our sailing out to sea to-day.
We are being escorted by four Japanese warship. They look well as they cut through the water.

The troops seem to have got over their attack of seasickness. There is more life about them to-day. Gun practise by the gunners in charge of the guns on the two troopships. Some substance was thrown overboard into the sea which gave off a yellow smoke which continued rising for a long time. At this the gunners fired and they struck bulls-eyes every time. This looked bad for any submarines which should come in our way.
