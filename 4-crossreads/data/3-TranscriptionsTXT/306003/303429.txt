15-7-16& won all the way, Mercer had a good name in the 2nd as he has won a good many fights through knock-outs but I outboxed him from the start & he could not get a decent punch home.Representatives of the 1st won 3 fights out of 4, so they did not do too bad, all the contests were fast & boxing clean;  The only knock-out of the night was scored by Mannion of the 3rd he met one of the 2nd LH men & knocked him out in the 2nd roundhe professes to be the Welterweight Champion of Tasmania;  Cunes of this Regt. will meet him next Monday night & I shall meet the winner in the final.  Cunes also has a good name here, being runner-up in the Amateur Championship of N.S.W. &says he is confident he can account for Mannion
