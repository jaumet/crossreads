<p>a very progressive nation in many ways!   what Grandfather did seems to suit them, but I suppose we must let them do as they please.  They are very industrious and good hard workers on their farms.   I should not care to settle down and live here, though I dont think there is enough of our french ancestors blood in my veins to ever make me take to the place properly Harry may.   I had a letter from him today he was well and had just been down to Wallington for a week end.   he has been having a pretty good time over there, Im glad to say it wont do him any harm and the longer he stays the better for himself.  I met one of J. Howells Battn, a corporal, he knew Jack and told me that in April J was all right they are some distance away from here but I am going to try and find out where they are and see if I can get leave to go up and see J. if he is still allright.   I also met one of Willies mates.   W. was very well liked by all and the man I spoke to about him spoke very highly of him.   I received another pair of sox from Bea a few days</p>
