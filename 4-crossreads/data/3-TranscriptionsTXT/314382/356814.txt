 November 28th: - A cold and bleak day with a strong head-blowing. Ship hugged the coast all day, it being, along with objects ashore, plainly visible. 
 Divine service held in morning and also afternoon. 
 Slept above in night. 
 November 29th: - Extremely cold and still windy. 
 On ward duties all day as usual. 
 The night was the coldest that we had experienced so far and it seemed hard to realise that Australia was having her summer then. 
 November 30th: - Still cold &amp; windy. 
 Passed the Orient liner "Orontes" at 8 am bound west. 
 Off duty for the afternoon, but on again at night. 
 December 1st: - A cool but pleasant day. 
 Passed Kangaroo Island which lies at the mouth of Spencers Gulf at 10 am. 
 At 4 pm, having arrived at Semaphore we anchored and prepared the S.A. men for disembarking. Owing to the lateness, however, this was postponed until next morning and consequently we laid in the stream all night. 
 December 2nd: - At 8 am this morning a tender came along side and the S.A. patients, numbering 80 were put aboard. Their departure was singularly enough [indecipherable] of any noise and demonstration. Why, I still wonder, for I should have certainly liked to give them a cheer as they left us at 9-30 am.
