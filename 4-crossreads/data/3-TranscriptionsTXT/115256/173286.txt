 There has been a most remarkable change in the weather to-day.  From the unpleasant heat, typical of the Red Sea, even in winter, it has changed round, until it is now quite cool.  It is these sudden changes of temperature that are accountable for the many cases of pneumonia, influenza and colds which are very prevalent throughout the convoy. 
 This morning, through the clouds, we were just able to discern the huge mountain ranges of Northern Africa.  Most grand-looking and impressive, they were a kind of reminder of the vastness of the continent of which they form a part.  Then there were more of those barren islands and away to starboard, dignified Mt. Sinai of biblical interest (the ark rested there, said one Australian savant and theologiste) was seen.  Then a general discussion commenced on the wanderings of the Israelites &ndash; a most appropriate subject for a troopship debate.  The debate was adjourned however when the business-like instincts of the Jews, someone declared, originated with Moses, in always doing everything in duplicate &ndash; even Commandments!
