<p>me &amp; was so pleased I'm so well.  He told matron I was to be in a light ward for a time, so you see I'm a spoilt dear.  Dorothy is very happy in her ward too and we have a room together again, so we are both very delighted.</p>
<p>Sister Hart (the one that was at Suez) is the sister in charge of this ward &amp; she is an awfully nice girl, so everything in the garden is lovely.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I was off duty.  It is a rule now that the patients fit to go for a little outing, go for a motor drive, once a week and a sister always goes with them.  I was asked if I would go.  So at 3 p.m. we left the Palace in a lovely motor car.  Five patients, dressed in loose <strike>kharki</strike> kaiki suits with bright red ties &amp; a Sister in uniform with red cape &ndash; we had a most delightful 1&frac12; hours &ndash; motored to Sporting Club (Gheyiah) and had Afternoon tea which the boys thoroughly enjoyed.  I shouted them and it was a great pleasure.  We saw a Polo match which was splendid.  Returned</p>
