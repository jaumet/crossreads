Dear Old Bloke.
Mr. Wavolnough said the war would soon be over and it is in the papers too and that will be lovely to have you home again?  we are going down to were the ship comes in.  But you cannot come till you turn is up.  It would be nise if you were first would'ent it.  Mum has a lot of your letters tierd up in a shoe lace, a Blue Ribbin and anothere Ribbin.  Good-night for to-night.

Mum went to Church to-day but we stayed at home and played all the time and mum was playing with all her might down there.  There are a lot of trees fallen down around the house there are two trees fallen down on the fence.  Much love from Ruth oxxxoo etc.
