<p>Wednesday 16 April 1919<br/>Bonny day today. Actually went on parade. Said good bye to the boys. Bill left for Blighty. Got word of my N.M. to being thro. Was on Hotel de Ville picquet. Saw the Avelings taking Mrs to the boat. Went to the dance after &amp; had about 8. Enjoyed 'em too. An Aussie mail came yesterday.</p>
<p>Thursday 17 April 1919<br/>Little sun today. Very little too. Went into town &amp; visited the museum &amp; a couple of churches. They were all worth seeing specially one of the churches which had glorious windows.  Was on the No 2 train. Jock Kennedy offered me a job to play football in Melbourne. Did not accept tho. Will see later.</p>
