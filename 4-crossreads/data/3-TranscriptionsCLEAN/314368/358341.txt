There is no certainty that these letters will reach home Mother so I cannot say too much now, but you may be assured that I am feeling quite well both in health and spirit, and often think of those at home.  I think that there are very few of us who do not wish at times that we were back home again, and it is often that we wake from a dream of home to the reality of France.

Your Loving Son,Gordon.
