9/2/18 Velinghem
Dowden rode as far as Quesques with me at 9.30 am then rode on to Selles to see Matthews. It was a blowy dull morning. Put up my horse at the billet and went down to the Regimental Office where I found word waiting for me that General Smythe was coming over. He duly turned up with Pat OHara Wood and we had a long talk. His V.C. C.Bs., war ribbons, Medaille Militaire and Legion of Honour make a fine show on his tunic. He confirms the 3 battalion to a brigade and suggests the highest numbered in each Bde. to be broken up. We talked of manpower and the War office and he said he would hang the Armys Council if he had his way for so letting the nation down.
