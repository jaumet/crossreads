We are on the bank of a small stream here & it is very pretty. There is a little bridge across & it recalled to me the yarn "Why is the old rustic Bridge like" etc. 
 21/7/16 Still at Canaples but nothing exciting has happened. The weather has been perfect these last few days, it is a treat to be in the sun after the rainy dull weather we've had. 
 Last night the Adjutant told me I could go for a joy ride this morning in the car if I could get up early enough. Stan was up in time you bet
