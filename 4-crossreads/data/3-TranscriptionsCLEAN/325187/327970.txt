 Dr Fay Maclure of Hay is a M.O. in this Hospital had a yarn with him today.  Heard today I shall be sent to England to finish my "cure" so as you get this I shall be on the sea.  I have had a Mauser bullet, a bomb & a Shrapnel shell.  I have yet to be torpedoed.  We have some bad cases in here-  Poor old Major  Shanahan  had his leg taken off- "there goes a good rider" he said. My kit Mufti was sent from Cooks today I got a couple of [indecipherable] when to open it.  The Military authorities had been through everything & of course had not repacked decently they no doubt expected to find BOMBS etc & even shrapnel.
