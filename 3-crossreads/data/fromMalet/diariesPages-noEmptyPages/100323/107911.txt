21/6/19 London
full of kiddies paddling in the basins and sailing boats pieces of wood. Crowds of Anzacs and other soldiers with their girls sitting round on the stone balustrades. Went into the National Gallery here ? not all open yet ? and saw many masterpieces. Pictures by Turner, Whistler, Gainsborough, Van Dyck, Rubens, Velasquez, Titian and many others. Then came home for a rest and a siesta. At 7.30 went in to the Globe Theatre and saw Marie Lohr in "L?Aiglon" ? fine play very well performed and all centreing on her. An exhausting and heavy part. Then went down to the Trocadero and had pea soup, an omelette and ice with squash for supper for 5/2 ? reasonable considering the chicness of the place. A jazz band worth watching. Had an interesting talk with an American who was in a German Lancers Regt until about 20 and then visited Berlin in 1919 ? a decent chap.
