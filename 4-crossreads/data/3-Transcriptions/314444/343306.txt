<p>Dear old Mater,</p>
<p>Once more I have the pleasure of addressing you.  Wrote last week &amp; told you all the news.  We went out on our big move against Jacko.  It lasted about 4 days &amp; was pretty fatiguing.  The actual attack on the camp did not last long &amp; was not pushed very seriously for good reasons I've no doubt.  The Turks were very strong there &amp; were taken by surprise we took a few prisoners &amp; retired about mid-day, after our artillery had put in a good few rounds.</p>
<p>Our aeroplane men are great.  One fellow was directing the artillery fire &amp; would fly over the Turks camp into a hail of shell fire, make his <strike>her</strike> observations &amp; then fly back to the artillery with a message.  He did it perhaps, a dozen times &amp; as soon as he would</p>
