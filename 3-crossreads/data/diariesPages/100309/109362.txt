At 9.30 am the Battalion moved off, followed by transport and cookers and marched via Millencourt . Troops in fighting order and the band playing. Little Chretian and her beaupere were out in the street to see the soldiers go by. A pleasant day and the country looked so soft and gentle with neat groves and the rolling undulations. Through Henencourt we turned to the right and then reached a fine field behind the Chateau where some troops were exercising. Some good .
Formed up the battalion in bivouac formation in the rear of the paddock and piled arms, blew cook house and had a picnic lunch. On the side of the field nearest the Chateau rose a wood and a high grassy bank which formed a natural grandstand. A boxing stadium had been erected in one place here. The sports commenced after the other battalions had in turn arrived.
