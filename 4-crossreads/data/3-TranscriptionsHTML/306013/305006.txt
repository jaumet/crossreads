<p>amusement of the crew.</p>
<p>The "lights out" bugle call tonight was the signal for a series of bombardments of hammocks and sleeping soldiers. Of course it is very easy to tumble out of a hammock, especially when you are assisted by a <u>gentle</u> push from below, and many of the boys had prepared for such emergencies by supplying themselves with batons and perhaps for this reason other means of amusement were soon sought. A great number of men now sleep on the troop-deck &amp; upper deck floors in preference to swinging in a hammock and these next attracted attention. De-Winton-Jones is always looked upon as a good hit for any joke, being regarded as somewhat simple in some ways. He spreads his hammock on the floor &amp; sleeps in it there. So, when he seemed quiet, a chap crept up to his feet &amp; tied a rope about 16 feet long onto the corner of his hammock &amp; three of them took the rope &amp; began to clear across deck with it.</p>
