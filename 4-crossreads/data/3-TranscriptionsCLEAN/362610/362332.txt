  
 Wednesday 26 April 1916 Another glorious Spring day, quite warm in the sun. Last night had a most exciting time on a/c of a Zeppelin raid. Just after midnight was dimly conscious of 3 explosions followed by Prescott saying "There are anti-aircraft guns!" At once hopped outside into the starry night, several other officers also appearing. The distant hum of the engines could clearly be heard & there at an enormous altitude we could distinguish the cigar-shaped ship. It was fearfully uncanny to see it manoeuvre & come, at it seemed, exactly overhead, then a whiz of a descending bomb was verified by a tiny streak of light as it dropped, ending by a blaze of light when it landed. The alarm was sounded in Etaples, trains stopped, afterwards running thro' in a bunch. We watched the airship disappear in the direction of England & then went to bed again. In the morning we examined the hole where in the estuary abt. 300 yds. from us the incendiary bomb had struck. Another dropped at No. 26 Hospital & others elsewhere, but no serious damage was apparently done. Most of the morning was at the dentist's, & in the afternoon company work, football & a swim (?) in the stream. A lot more mail in but only one (G.H.) for me. A French (?) aeroplane carrying lights patrolling the stretch from here to Boulogne during the night.
