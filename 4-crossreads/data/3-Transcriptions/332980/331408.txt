<p>I spent a couple of hours laying down reading &amp; had a doze &amp; at 3.30 left the Beach &amp; walked back to Town &amp; into the S.A. Hostel to have a cup of Tea &amp; some Scones, &amp; off to the Station &amp; into the Train which left on time going in a different direction to St Omer, passing through Goodekirk, Bergues, Esquelbec;  Arneke, Cassell passing through still beautiful country where all hands were busy, all along the line for a long way there are Boxes, with Danger written on the Top, as this direction is getting closer to the German Line, there are Trenches dug everywhere for our Troops to fall back on, in case Fritz makes a big Push &amp; the Boxes along the line are no doubt filled with Explosives to blow up the Rails as we retreat, After leaving Cassell the line junction's off to the Right &amp; soon mets the Main line at Wallen Cappell which is the Old Main line to Hazebruick. After leaving the last place we passed through Eblingham Renescure, Milo Junction &amp; at 7.5 Pm arrived back at St Omer, where I went out &amp; had a Drink &amp; back for my Hot Dinner &amp; a rest &amp; at 10 Pm turned in for the night.</p>
