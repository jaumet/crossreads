Very hot - about 110 in the coolest tent, the wind blowing about 30 miles an hour & the dust would blind you - Two fall ins - done a little fatigue & tried to keep cool the rest of the day. No church parade.

Very hot - even hoter hotter than yesterday - hot winds & sand storm still raging - hot enough outside, but the bell tents are just like ovens - Had some heavy drill under Capt Coppleson - also some lectures & drill on loading a new style of Ambulance wagons - Went for a march over to the best water offering - which is back water from the Canal - it was a compulsory swim & all the division were there, it was a great sight & just man everywhere.
