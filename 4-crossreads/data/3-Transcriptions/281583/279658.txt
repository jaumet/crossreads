<p>I was well satisfied with my sojourn in the trench &amp; returned sadder &amp; wiser than before.</p>
<p>29.9.16 Friday</p>
<p>The rain commenced again today but did not set in, although it is still rather dull with a cold wind blowing. Great success has been attained on the Somme &amp; the British have now thrown the Germans back from the Ridge which the whole world thought impregnable.</p>
<p>There is a big artillery battle being waged here on the Ypres Sector right through to the Coast. I do not know what it means, as general opinion has it that there will be no infantry attacks here, but judging by the fierce artillery fire there is something doing. I heard however that that it is to prevent the Germans withdrawing men for the Somme front. My cold has loosened &amp; I hope to shake it off completely by tomorrow, Everything is bustle in this region now to make preparations for the oncoming winter. I have had un-official orders that my Supply Section will have to move up in closer proximity to the trenches, which is no bar for me.</p>
<p>Everyone is looking forward to further developements in the Somme area &amp; before long the whole front may be ablaze from end to end.</p>
