  
 home to put in the whole place in wheat in the last fortnight or so - but the dreams are good fun & we always laugh over them next morning. I hope you are not having too cold a winter when you get this - we could spare you some of the heat from e  here I guess. Am off to have another swim now Mother so will stop. Love to Father and Hal and Fred and yourself. I am Your loving son Robert C. Wilson. 
 P.S. I'm posting home another Kia ORa Cooee. It says in the paper that you have to put a half penny stamp on them. Everybodies sending them home and no body has got any stamps, or knows where to get any from, so I dont know whats going to happen - but I spex you'll have to go to jail over it as it has your name on it.
