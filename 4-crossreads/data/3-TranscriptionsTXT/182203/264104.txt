 I wonder if Edmund will go into the Firing-line or stay in London. I may meet him, one never can tell, perhaps he will write to me. I should imagine the Bennetts were surprised at seeing you &ndash; how strange to come in contact with two old friends again. Mrs Low must be a wonderful woman. Remember me to them. Sorry Mrs W. is not too strong. Yes, Ethel, I've read "The Sentimental Bloke" a number of times &amp; like it immensely. Must try to get a copy of it. Still very quiet, leading a very simple life &ndash; real Active Service Food &ndash; No extra mess arrangements here. Plenty of Bully Beef. &ndash; Still feeling very fit &amp; buy a few biscuits etc to keep the hunger away. Wish Belle could send some of her cakes &amp; puddings along. We would enjoy them. Fondest love to you all. From,                                                                                                 Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                          Edith.
