growing very tired of all these mean and petty restrictions, and I am not the only one. A lot of the boys, are getting properly fed up with the whole business, I dont wonder, tor at times they get plenty of provocation, but its no use, talking about it. Some day perhaps. things will be different .or the war will finish, there is very much talk in the papers about the likelihood of peace being declared at an early date. from where the rumours come from it is hard to say but I dont think they come from the front line. the Huns still have a kick left in them. Their latest hit at Italy shows that very plainly, but Russia can take the blame for that. I wish the Japs would come in on that front and get busy. I really believe that, they would be worth ten times as much as the Russians, I have no faith in them at all. even though the papers may call them our gallant Allies.
