  
 the harbour a large Battleship steamed slowly & stately out.  She shewed signs of being in action, half of the rear mast was carried away & big splashes of white on different parts of her hull shewed where she had been hit.  We all had to stand to attention as we passed one another.  Inside lay the Queen Elizabeth with here 8 - 15" guns & several smaller boats as well as one Russian Cruiser & a Frenchy, one Hospital ship several transports & colliers.  On the slopes of the hills were dotted numerous tents containing we believe our 3rd brigade.  Oranges are now going strong.  We can buy them over the side for 6' a dozen. 
 Thursday 8th At anchor in Lemnos Harbour alongside another transport.  We have just heard that Bulgaria has joined Turkey.  Poor Bulgaria.  Today I was called for guard for the first time & have to put in 24 hours.  4 on & 8 off.  It is very tiring to stand for 4 hours as there is no room to do a proper walk.  The horsemen exercised round the deck today with much slipping stamping & playing up in general.  There is no further news of landings & we have to be content to gaze on the green slopes of Lemnos & dream of the orange groves.  There will be a few less of us to dream however shortly.  My sentry duty proved more enjoyable than I thought possible.  For my second spell I was called at midnight & did till 4 A.M. the time went by fairly quickly & gave me ample time for thought  I decided that I would not change my present position for one in Australia for anything.
