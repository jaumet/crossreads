rest assured I shall do so.
One day Sister came to me saying I could go down for my Kit. This meant I was transferred to another hospital which was Southall Middlesex.
This place was run entirely by Australian M.O. Sisters and wardsmen - all Australians. A Mrs. Macpherson was in charge of the Canteen arrangements She was very kindly disposed amongst the soldiers
To go back. Leaving Woolwich I went on to a Motor to Lewisham Station The M.O. of the ward had sent me to walk on crutches. It was particularly an impossibility for me to do so as I was not at all sure of myself in my opinion
It was quite a long order
