10-3-17spin to Helouin after doing some shopping, passed Brains & Hicks & felt inclined to get out & have an argument but they gave us a smile of recognition & did not pass any remarks on us wearing caps; Had tea at the Tewfik Palace Hotel at Helouin arriving back at the Nurses Club at 6 oclock Cobb met us here at dinner, we then went to the concert at the Anzac Hostel & found it very good, the items were contributed by the Welch singers; We then engaged gharries & went for a drive across the Nile & back to Zeitoun; Harris & I left the party here & the girls & High went back to Abassia; High is only a kid & a fine little fellow, midnight before we got to bed tonight
