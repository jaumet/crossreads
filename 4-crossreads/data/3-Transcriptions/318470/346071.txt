<p>3.4.17<br/>Today Sapr. Smith A.E.W. &amp; I visited Louverval &amp; Doignies to look for Wells, found one Well at Boignies which appears to have good water in it.  All the rest have either been mined or filled with rubbish.  There was heavy Enemy shelling in both villages while we were there.  At about 6.30 p.m. one of Fritz's aeroplanes shot down two of Balloons which fell in flames.  The aeroplane got back safely to his lines.</p>
