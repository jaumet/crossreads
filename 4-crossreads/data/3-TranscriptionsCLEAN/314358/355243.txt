 This hospital is pleasantly situated 
 It is mostly of tents pitched on moss - mingled grass, with pine woods and quaint farm houses near by.   Away to the South East streatches the peaceful; tame scenery of France.  Cultivated fields and planted trees and bread-loaf stacks of corn, through the woods on the North, only 5 minutes walk distant, is the ever grand sea. But the beach there is a sad place to me.  It is for every dreary and grey, wind swept and desolate, not all like our golden beaches of Australia.  There is a town away down to the west which can be seen from or part of the beach, soldiers can obtain passes to visit there, but so far I have not bothered.  On Sundays many French people with their children come to our woods and lay - that is the children do - the women who seem charming bring their sewing and try to talk to the soldiers 
 The children are mostly what you would
