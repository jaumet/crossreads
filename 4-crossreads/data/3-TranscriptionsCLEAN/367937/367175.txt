as I have had my knife broken and my fountain pen pinched.I only laid my pen down on the table for a minute while I looked away but when I turned round again it had gone.  I think I know who took it but of course cant do anything except watch him.Will you send me the "Swan" over please.  I can easily get another knife but a pen costs about 80 piastres and, when one P. is worth 2 1/2, it is a lot of money.
We do very little work here as it is so hot, the principle thing is a route march in the early morning and then we lie down most of the day:  One thing about this climate is you can always sleep at night; as soon as the sun goes down it comes up quite cold and you will see the guards in the middle of the night wearing overcoats. There is a photographic shop here and I have been able to buy films and have given them two films to develop but have not got them back yet.The flies are pretty bad here but as the chaps say there some good as they help to stop the glare. We saw the Mount Sini Peninsular coming up through the Red Sea and My word! it is a rough place, all barren mountains running up to  sharp points.  I would not like to have to climb them.  It is the sort of country the Government wo like to get hold of in Tasmania Australia to settle returned soldiers on; so the chaps say here.We have lovely cool mess sheds here made of a sort of cane stuff. I am writing in one now but the flies are bad in here and the dust is blowing so it is rather hard work and I think I will go off and go to sleep in my tent till dinner time.We are able to buy cucumbers & tomatoes from the niggers so have plenty of fresh vegetables.
