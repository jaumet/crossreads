<p>Dear George<br/>Another summer Picture. The trees are all bare now.  I may go to see "Faust" at the Theatre on Sunday. The road where the man pushes the cart is the Rue de Paris, the Corso of Havre. On Sunday night it is thronged with more people than get on the Corso. The din is enormous especially from the Trams which ding along &ndash; dong, ding, dong, every 10 yds. It is impossible to stand at a crossing similar to King &amp; George Sts for the din would send one crazy. You remember the picture we have of the Bay, the chestnuts, the old man  &amp; the snow. I am always reminded of it when I see the Roast chestnut venders who set up their stalls just off the Footpath along this place. They are allright too. I've had some.  Regards  Harry</p>
