1/8/17 Campagne
seem to have God with them and we have to fight him as well as they. Our guard marched down smartly today. Indeed generally I can see a great improvement in smartness all round.
2/8/17
Rained nearly all day. Major Miles was round in the morning and we picked a miniature range for our practice. After lunch went round all the billets and saw the companies at work ? some on the Lewis gun stripping and assembling blindfold and in the dark. Walked down to Bde HQ at Wardrecques and saw Bridges. A very pleasant walk from one village to another the crops growing right up to the roadside. The iron stays passing through the walls of the houses and barns are used to denote the date of building i.e."1748". Being payday yesterday there was some drunkenness and it is hard to know why the chaps will persist in calling one another bastards as soon as they get a few drinks in.
