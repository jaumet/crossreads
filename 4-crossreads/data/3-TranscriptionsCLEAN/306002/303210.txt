  
 28.6.15 possible, as it was thought that they may have taken troops from here to reinforce at Achi Baba, very heavy fighting has been going on in that direction all day.  A German Taube flew over us  flew over us  again to-day.  About sundown yesterday 6 of our planes were flying over the point that the warboats bombarded to-day & they made a grand sight.  I was not feeling too bright this morning & went to the Dr. again, he gave me 7 pills to take at one dose & I have been too frightened to move all day.  The attacking party on the right had orders only to take 2 line of trenches, but they were not satisfied with that, but took also the third, the warboats seeing men moving in the 3rd line of trenches thought they were Turks & opened fire on them, our casualties were about 200 in consequence.  9th & 12th Btn. & a Sq. of 6th L.H. took part, the Turks.
