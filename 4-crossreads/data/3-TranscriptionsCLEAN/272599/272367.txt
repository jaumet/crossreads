 Good Friday - no recognition.    Get our packs fixed for moving off after dinner.    Work the baths in forenoon.   Fall in at 2.30 p.m.   14th Field arrives & takes over.  We move out immediately with full packs & blankets up for Bazentin-le-Petit - 6 miles further up where the Dressing Station was during the late stunt.  Have 2 rests on the way.  Pass Casualty Corner Pozieres, & thro Contalmaison once agains.   Point out the places of history to the new reinforcements.   Arrive at destination on 5.30 p.m. tea.  Pretty tired. Receive bundle of papers from Harry - very welcome as no letters have come to hand for a month past for any body some hitch in the postal service apparently.    To bed early & have a good old read of local papers, come upon many interesting tit bits.
