<p>6/1/16<br/>A fine day with a sun that is growing more powerful as we go further south. We expect to make Alexandria at 1000 tomorrow. The sea is still choppy and a few are sick. Inspection of ship at 1100 was a long business and a long retinue followed in the wake of the O.C. Troops. McCaul, Davis, Pedler &amp; Elmiger are all laid up and under the doctor. Time is flying so rapidly that our stay in the trenches will seem like a dream. Then we get back to the desert (N.B. Our local trench names Imshi funkhole, Backsheese alley, Zigzag alley, Allah Road, Reilly St. Drain, Yarra Road, Curnow St. Nazir).</p>
<p>Afternoon fell in and cleaned the ammunition pouches. The iron ration issued at Mudros is our landing ration, any who broke into it will be sorry. It should never be broached without an officers orders and is contained in a canvas coin bag. Consists of 1 tin bully beef and about half the bag of small white biscuits about one inch square &amp; also a soldered tin containing a packet of tea and another of sugar and some cubes of meat extract.</p>
<p>Some good seas running and the roll is most unpleasant. About tea time we run into a thunder storm. The air is quickly becoming very close &amp; we are shedding warm clothing rapidly. All the ports and windows are fitted with dead lights and we are going along with all lights doused. Packed kit ready for disembarkation and turned in. Slept like a top. Ventilation bad all ports closed for lights.</p>
