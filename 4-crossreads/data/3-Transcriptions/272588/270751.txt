<p>Bayonvillers.  On Amiens- <strike>St. Quentin</strike> Nesle Rd.</p>
<p>Friday 9 August<br/>Move again from Allonville to Corby, M.D.S. on the Somme, in which we had a swim.  This place is just behind Villers Brettoneux &amp; just to right and about five kilos ahead.  Again to-night we moved further out across the country over which our troops advanced to an A.D.S. at Bay on villers. Heavens our troops have advanced &amp; even now though five miles over the old German line, we are yet miles behind. Our marching to-day has been about fifteen miles &amp; to-night Fritz is bombing &amp; caught some chaps nearby. No shell fire much, but a number of casualties. Meet Roy Jamieson.  All Divisions are in this &amp; thousands of prisoners have been taken.  The advance is about ten miles on this part, through villages of Warfuses, Bayonvillers &amp; Harbonierre which of course have been smashed about.</p>
<p>Saturday 10 August<br/>Early this morning we moved up to Brigade H.Q. just behind a C.C.S. once used by us &amp; taken by Fritz in his advance on March 21st.  It is now in our hands again &amp; standing.  It is just near Rosieres taken by the Canadians yesterday.  The front line is just over the ridge ahead of us, about &frac34; mile on. Aerial activity is great, two planes probably Boshe, being brought down in flames this afternoon. I should say we are well over eight miles from our old front line. Fritz is now shelling locally &amp; fairly consistently.  Harbonierre is a village we passed through to-day not badly damaged.</p>
