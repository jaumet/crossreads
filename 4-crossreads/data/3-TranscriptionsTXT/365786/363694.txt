 There is a saying in Egypt that "this land is the gift of the Nile" &amp; it is literally true.  For  15  5 to 20 miles on either bank of the Nile it is like a series of climbing gardens.  Egypt is a small region with the Mediterranean Sea on the North, the Arabian Desert &amp; the Red Sea on the East &amp; the Libyan Desert in the West.  The Southern Boundary is not marked by any natural features &amp; has at all ages been liable to alteration. It is 640 miles long by 596 broad &amp; its area is only 400,000 sq. miles, this is inclusive of deserts.   Below  South of Cairo is called Upper Egypt while the city of Cairo &amp; land to the North is called Lower Egypt.
