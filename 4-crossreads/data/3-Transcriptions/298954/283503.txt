<p>1917<br/>Sun. Aug 5th (cont.)<br/>position of the vessel &amp; then returned.  He was a considerable distance away when he signalled.</p>
<p>Mon. Aug 6th<br/>Of course we were not allowed on deck in the early morning &ndash; the "Wolf" was in full chase.   At 7.30 am she fired a stopping shot.</p>
<p>From under the poop we saw the new prize stopped as we swung round her, but we did not recognise her as a Burns Philp boat in her coat of war-grey paint.   However, we were allowed up on deck at about nine and recognised her as the "Matunga".   At about 9.30 am. a load of prisoners came off in the boats.   The first boat contained 3 military officers (Australian) &amp; some soldiers.   We were lining the poop-rails clad in our rags ("shorts", bath-towels, etc) and the new prisoners quite failed to recognise us as British!   The second boat contained the ship's officers, among them being my old acquaintance Bob Taylor.</p>
<p>He failed to recognise me for quite 30 seconds in my "shorts", coat of sunburn, &amp; boche haircut.</p>
