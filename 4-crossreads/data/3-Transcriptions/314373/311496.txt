<p>useful. In the evening we went to the Dandies with Ron, Keith and Billy McDougall. I happened to mention that there would be a lot of grandmothers in Perth to-morrow in order to get leave and a lady named Mrs.Tweedall, next to Keith evidently heard for she took our names and said she would write to Collins for leave to visit her.<br/>Tuesday 28/12/15  To-day I was on town picket and Keith, Bill and I got leave from Clive who was Sargent  to go to Mrs.Tweedall to tea. We did not do much all day having plenty of time off.<br/>Wednesday 29/12/15  The picket had general leave to-day and so I went to Freemantle this morning and got my mail from the boat and also had a look round the town. I met Bill Wright in the afternoon and had a look round the streets and shops of Perth. The evening I spent at the Y.M.C.A. writing letters.<br/>Thursday 30/12/15.

Roll and butter was only 2d also pies. These prices are of course very low. The camp itself has very good appointments with cement floors on showers and latrines and a small meat safe for each hut. There are also a large number of tents which are lavishly shaded by gum trees. That evening I went to Perth to get any telegrams and received a lettergram from Topsy and those at Middleton, so sent one in reply. I returned to camp early.
