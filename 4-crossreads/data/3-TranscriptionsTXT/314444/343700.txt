Dearest Mother &amp; Father,Recieved your very welcome letters dated 18 April. I also recieved one from Dorothy dated 1 May, so I expect yours along any day. I recieved also a nice parcel of cigarettes from Miss Brown, which were very welcome. I am enclosing a letter to her, please address, Miss Maude Brown 234a Alfred St North Sydney. I hope you are all keeping good health. I am in tip top health &amp; feeling as fit as a fiddle. We are enjoying good weather. Everything is looking nice and green It is much nicer than the bare land as it was a few months ago. You should be recieving a nother photo of me. hope you like it.I hope this big Russian offensive has some thing to do with the ending of the war. Possibly we may be home for Xmas. I do hope so. I had some more letters &amp; parcels from Aunt Florrie. She is very kind to me.Hoping you are all well. Best wishes and love &amp; kisses
Your loving Son
