 Friday Jan. 10. 1919. 61. Dull &amp; cloudy but fine. I finished reading "Pan's mountain" a classical story by Amelie Rives (Princess Troubetzkoy. The scene of the story is in Italy &amp; it is rather weird tale and it ends unhappily. The lovers do not get married. [shorthand symbols] I wrote to my wife to day. Letter 153 A new patient came in this evening. The ward is now full up. End of Book XI
