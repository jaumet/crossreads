<p>We were ashore most of the following day. The best way to see Durban and its environments, is to get on top of a tram. The tramways have a circular system, which takes you from the centre of the city through the suburbs and back again by a different route.</p>
<p>We bid farewell to this glorious place and it&#39;s people, on the evening of the second day there, and proceeded on our way to our next port of call. After about two days travelling we arrived and anchored at</p>
<p><u>CAPETOWN.</u></p>
<p>At this port we were not allowed to land. The people here did not appear to have the same respect for&nbsp;Australians as was the case at Durban. Some boat had called here a few days previous and the behaviour of the troops had not been satisfactory. We anchored in the Bay. By way of showing our disgust at not being allowed to land, we released the Captain&#39;s pigeons from their imprisonment, and threw the ducks overboard. (There was great trouble over this action of ours, as the officer&#39;s mess suffered). We only stayed at Capetown a few hours. The scenery as you approach is magnificent. The table mountain unique.</p>
<p>We continued our journey, and there was little of note that took place,&nbsp;except perhaps, it was noticeable that the trip was becoming irksome, the fellows started to disagree, we grumbled at the food, the pace of the boat, the dirty black crew, (which had interested us up to now), the smell of the sheep and cattle (which were gradually being reduced in numbers), at the sergeants because they were treated better than ourselves, in fact anything that previously we had laughed at, we now growled at. We wanted to get off the boat, we were sick of the voyage.</p>
<p>Many a time in the near future did we wish ourselves back on her. Such is life, even the greatest pleasures pall on us&nbsp;at times, and we long for change, the traveller and adventurer longs for a quiet life, the &nbsp;&nbsp;longs to travel and see other lands. The pauper desires wealth</p>
