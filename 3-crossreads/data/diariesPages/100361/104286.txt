A.G.B.D. Le Havre
The City is still "out of Bounds" but the Influenza seems to be abating. It gets very monotonous in Camp and one is glad of a run into the City occasionally.
Fri Nov 1st
Felt rotten all day. At night went to Med. Tent and asked for a dose of med. The chap in charge took my Temp. It was 102, so he sent me into Hospital as hes said I had the "Flu". Had to fly round and put my gear in Q.M. store, before going into Camp Hospital.
Sat Nov 2. 
Slept well last night between nice white sheets. Porridge and drink of milk for Break. Pas bow Doc came round about 11, marked me "Light diet and stay in Bed". Had Beef Tea and milk Pudding for Dinner. No visitors are allowed in Hospital on account of "Flu". The Padres come in tho? and take Letters away to be censored. I'm hanged if I can write.
Sun Nov 3. 
Spent another quite day in Bed. Made an attempt to write Letter, but I hate writing in Bed, and had to give it up. Am still on Light diet.
Mon 4. 
Thank the Lord my Temp is down again. Now I can have something to eat. Lill will begin to wonder what's wrong if I don't write my weekly epistle. But what's the good of me writing like this when she knows that I didn't write. At least she will do when she gets my Letter No 43. 
Had a good dinner today. Stewed Rabbit, and a drink of good Tea, with real sugar in it.
Wed Nov 6. 
Got Letter from Perce Taylor at Weymouth. He seems to be having a good time. The Salv. Army came round today and brought us some Butter Scotch, which was mighty welcome. He is a fine chap, with a cheerful smile and a voice like a roaring Bull.
Feeling much better.
