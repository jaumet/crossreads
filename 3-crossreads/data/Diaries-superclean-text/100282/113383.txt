where they were playing "Carmen" we were too late so we booked seats for "La Travita" 4 days ahead, from here we taxied down to the Rue de Sebastopol, as it was getting late we decided to have our tea so we went into a big restaurant set to work, I ate something tonight which I never thought I would be game to tackle in the "creation of eats" nothing less than a plate of "escargots" (snails) fancy sitting up to a plateful of them, 3 of us had them 2 doz oysters, the snails were dished up in a little tray, boiled in their shells with a little bit of green chopped very fine over their mouth, a special fork is provided to eat them with, would you believe it they do not taste too bad, we ate them quite easily what do you think of that, they have a sweet taste something like liver, this was the best restaurant we have struck so far very reasonable 7 course dinner for 4 francs a good one at that before leaving Paris I must taste some frogs they reckon they are pretty good I should not be surprised after the snails.
