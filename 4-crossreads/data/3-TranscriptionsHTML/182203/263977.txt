<p>to manage the Post Office &ndash; It is fearfully badly managed. We do not know how long we shall be here, so still address my letters as before.<br/>Well, we reached Gordon House about 10.15. p.m. It is a most beautiful building  &amp; had only been seized    <strike>2</strike>  3 days before from German Spys. It was cleaned  &amp; only had our beds ready for sleeping, not even a chair &ndash; so we all had a wash, then went to Heliopolis House Hotel for supper. It is the best place here. Mr. C. said he would follow me but he went to The Palace &amp; could not find out where we were. Glad to get to bed &amp; joy able to stay in bed until 8. a.m. Had to go to another place for our breakfast  &amp; it was funny &ndash; A french restaurant  All got so excited at seeing so many Sisters that we did not get out of the place until 10. a.m. Breakfast &ndash; 3 eggs fried with tomatoes, potatoes &amp; green peas. bread &amp; butter &amp;  tea. All for 10d in our money.</p>
