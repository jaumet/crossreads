went off to Opera though everyone told us we could never get in. However a knowledge of French is handy & things worked well & we got an excellent seat - right in centre of house.
The theatre is a fine spacious building though one has to mount a flight of stairs to reach even the ground floor. There is no promenoir & one must go outside to smoke. The entrance seemed dirty & draughty & the passage & rooms outside the theatre itself cramped one to the extent of being uncomfortable. The interior is large & luminously gilded the roof pointed with figures in the sky & looks real while the chandelier of electric lights is gorgeous. The seating accomodation I should estimate at 2500 about. There are 4 tiers or [indecipherable].
The play was Faust & excellent it was the artists being imported from Opera at Paris. Huberty ([indecipherable]) Valentin (Lestelly an excellent voice) Marguerite (Mareille Berthon). The performance was excellent & the 9f 50 was an excellent investment
In middle we went to Brasserie & picked up Young & Morton gave him a reserved seat After performance concluded we visited Hotel de Paris on [indecipherable] & then to Charley Bar in Peace du Vieux Marche & finally picked up the valiant Cameronian & started off for home.
