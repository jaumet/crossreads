<p>7/5/17           Norreuil<br/>starting to come in now and our tired chaps won't be sorry to get well back. At about 10 pm Q.M. &amp; C.O. arrived and while they were there the General ordered us to move right out tout de suite back to camp. Needed no second telling but got to work at once and started them moving pushing on by horse with Stewart &amp; Evans. It was pathetic to see the "coys." Marching out &ndash; groups of about 40 men each. We marched in each 160 strong &ndash; fine tall gallant lads. Riding home our thoughts ran on our dead. Dyer a Lance Corporal and a beautifully built giant is dead. He was the incarnation of brute strength &amp; energy at our sports a week ago. Joe Slater Hogarth, Scammell, Filmer, Fraser &ndash; all dead God rest them. Dear old Bert Curnow, Doc Mackay, Bruce King &ndash; what grand chaps we have lost. Rode on in silence our backs to the flashing hungry guns. A still close evening with bruised grass calling out for rain. Clouds were gathering and drops commenced to fall</p>
