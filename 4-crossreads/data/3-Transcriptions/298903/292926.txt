<p>allowance.  Things this way are working very smoothly.  Developed several films, all of which were satisfactory.</p>
<p>Wednesday 23rd  Nothing of interest.</p>
<p>Friday 25th  Anzac Day<br/>The fouth anniversary of the day &amp; I had hoped to be home for it. We received a wireless from the munitioneers on the "Kursk" of congratulation, also one from Holman N.S.W. on behalf of the State.  Concert last night but we have no interest now except to see the end of the voyage.  The ship is speeding up a bit &amp; expects to reach Fremantle on Sunday.  Weather now Cool and absolutely delightful after the heat.</p>
<p>Saturday 26th  A quiet day ending with a lecture on Lord Nelson.  Very rough during the afternoon and a few went down to it, felt heady myself.  Reach Fremantle tomorrow.</p>
