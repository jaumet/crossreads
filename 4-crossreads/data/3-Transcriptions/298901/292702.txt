<p>After breakfast the stream, of wounded continued including a lot of Germans &amp; we were going strong until midday.  I then obtained 6 men from C section to relieve my tired men whom I sent off until 6 P.M. for a spell &amp; later increased the staff by 3 men night &amp; day as more  men were now available.  Had to send stores to the line &amp; prepared a requisition for more but before doing so obtained a signature on a blank form from the D.D.M.S. the first time to my knowledge for it to be done, the rush being responsible.<br/>Various duties kept me at it until 10 P.M. when I turned in after a day of 18 hours on my feet all the time.  We have 10 men to bury, two being Germans &amp; one unknown tommy, he having no identification of any kind.  Most of the huns were fine big men, a few youngsters being noticeable but no more than our own.  Some were very talkative &amp; one told us that Japan was going to take  Australia.</p>
