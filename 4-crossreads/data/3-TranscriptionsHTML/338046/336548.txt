It covers about 500 acres and is like a big park. There are two rivers running through it. At the end of a long pathway is a big seat, in which Cardinal Wolsey (and [indecipherable]) is supposed to have sat. coming back along the river we saw a small tree, which Bill said had been planted by the Kaiser. Just about the time the war began a storm blew half of it down but did not touch any other tress in the park. The lawns are very large, with cedar of Lebanon planted at intervals. In a small garden house is a bust of some man, that looked like Shakespeare to me. No name was attached. I believe that he was at Wilton House for a while. We looked through the window into one room, the library; it looked very comfortable though if one or two of the easy chairs had been recovered, it would have been to their advantage. The other rooms were not available</p>
