had seen. Think he is just out of the school. We have one very good man but that is all. The O.C. is to be back shortly I believe so things should take a change then if he know anything. I would have liked to have been in last night. Roy stayed here & caught the half past eight train home. My word we have had a couple of lovely frosts the last couple of days. Have written Aunty Lily today & thanked her for the invitation on Sunday. Think I will come to Sydney though if I can get away no more just now Father hope to see you Saturday night or Sunday. Love & best wishesYour sincere Son  Clyde
