  
 The girls letters answered.  That from Doffie will be left till this afternoon or tomorrow.  In a few minutes the envelopes addressed to you & Macquarie Street will pass from me to the post office, hence happy and speedy journey to Australia for them. 
 "The greatest virtue of which wise men boast Is to abstain from ill when pleasing most." - Sonnet [Shakespeare] - No doubt you, like others who know not Egypts desserts, think the surface of the inhospitable lands to be covered feet deep with sand.  A truly erroneous notion, because when one gets to know, he learns that the loose sand is but few inches deep, except where drifts can accumulate, and that the dessert's surface is for much part wind swept pebbles or projections of rock from whence every particle of light loose material is kept blown away.  These rocky projections much resemble the black masses which one notes projecting from the white of the snowfields and the blue white of the glaciers which have been photographed for general information by Antarctic travellers. 
 Goodbye.  To your colleagues my regard & admiration.  May heaven send prosperous life, long & happy to each & every one of you. To yourself much love & heaps of kisses
