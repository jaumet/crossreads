<p>C/o. D. M. S.<br/>Cairo<br/>Egypt<br/>29th June 1915.</p>
<p>My dear Girls:</p>
<p>Did I tell you that it is probable that I have made good during my first independent command in Egypt.   General Maxwell was so pleased with his visit here one morning last week that he spoke in very flattering terms of the work done here, to Surgeon General Ford, who is that superior officer who asked me to take on this work.  I am glad because under Martin I had no chance to show whether there was within me capacity for good or evil.  It may be that time will give to me further opportunities for higher work, if so and God gives to me good health I hope still to struggle forward.</p>
<p>This evening another cable came from MacNamara about the land.   I expected the papers to be here from Buchannan before now, they should certainly reach me by the next mail.   They will be returned at once.  It is not likely that any one here could manage the business with sufficient accuracy to avoid mistakes, hence did I send for our own solicitors to put the sentences in proper sequence, it will be the most expeditious way in the end.</p>
<p>By jove, this is an Egyptian day; sweltering heat, drinking water all day long, and it pouring out through the pores of the skin in such rapid fashion as to need more to keep the blood stream sufficiently supplied to have it in state compatible with health.</p>
<p>In the morning I shall ring up No. 2 G.H., making enquiries for letters.  Hope will be with me that the reply may be yes.</p>
<p>Jerome and I were talking about flies, while I was taking my evening meal.   The little black wretches were a bother.  He affirmed that the species were more numerous and troublesome than in N. S. Wales.  I differed from him, saying that the black fly is more lazy and more easily frightened than is his Australian homologue, and that we should thank God for the absence of the brown blow-fly, than which no more objectionable beastie flies, he is par excellence in the resorts of the Blue mountains.</p>

<p>God be with you all for the night, I have done.  Good night.   Good night!!! Good night!!!!!<br/>[A line of Xs and Os.] Car. [A line of Xs and Os.] Joe. [A line of Xs and Os.] Kit.</p>
