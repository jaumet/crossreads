<p>Still, I don't want you all to get the wind-up when you hear that we are in France.</p>
<p>I met Bob Simpson who used to go to St. James Sunday School.  You remember the Boy that I accompanied on the violin &amp; lived next door to Fox's Place in Park Road.  Also, Harry Johns who lived behind us in Robert St., Burwood.  They were over from France on Furlough &amp; came down here one on Escort &amp; one to see one of our Sergeants.</p>
<p>Well, Mum, I thank you for your Birthday wishes.  I trust that you are all well &amp; happy.  We keep on going as happy as we can.</p>
<p>Regards to all the Neighbours.  Reg. &amp; Norm. Keirle are still in England.  I heard from Reg. only 2 days ago.</p>
<p>Fond Love<br/>Harry.</p>
