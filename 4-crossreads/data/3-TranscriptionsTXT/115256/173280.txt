 Thursday 21 January 1915 
 No rumour, but a reality to-day!  We have become sceptical as regards the sighting of strange or unknown men-of-war.  But to-day, at 12.20 p.m. one was actually sighted, away to starboard.  From the flagship, signal after signal was sent, but no reply.  By 2.10 p.m., excitement ran high.  Every starboard deck presented a compact front of faces, field-glasses and telescopes, and naval officers wore a worried look.  The "Berrima", on ahead with the "AE2", was ordered to starboard, for, although the stranger was flying the White Ensign, none of our signals had been acknowledged.  We then signalled to the "Berrima", "Let submarine know warship not disclosed identity, prepare".  But the submarine, anticipating the order by a few minutes, had already disengaged, and dismantled its wireless, preparatory to "going below".  At length, only after our little escort had taken up a decidedly threatening attitude, did she deign to reply.  It proved to be an East India Marine, employed by the Indian Govt. for patrol work, putting down pirating, preventing smuggling etc.  Usually it flies the Blue Ensign, but in war time, the White Ensign.  It is to be reported for its laxity in delay to reply.
