Jan; 7We often have the Band - though rather nosiy, to get away from it some little distance it isn't so bad. Also occasionally we have concerts - Lieut. Geddes has a very charming voice, well-trained; but there is always such a crowd of men and so much discomfort, interjections and noise, that I prefer not to go to these concerts.
Jan; 8Practise despatch running - general instructions. I have dinner in the sergeants' mess, which is quite excellent; stewards, etc., though I get into trouble for this.

Jan; 9Have a chat with Willoughby Bell - he's awfully een for me to read a little book on the South African War. I skim it
