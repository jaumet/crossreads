1915May. 17 Mon.Not much work to do - the new place appears to be run much more on system than Mena. Spent some time in straightening up the office which is pretty untidy.1st Cairo B-P Scouts meet every Monday, Wednesday  & Friday at their headquarters - attended their meeting to-night & spent a very decent time there with "Snow" Freeman (Private, No. 2 G.H.). One of the Asst. S.Ms. shewed us the Troop printing outfit & Carpenter's Bench and room they are fitting up as gymnasium.The food we get at Gezira could not be better & we have a native to wait on us for 6 piastres a head per month.Am sleeping upon the 1st floor in an empty room on a wicker bedstead with mattress & pillow (the latter a Kyarra souvenir) - Very Kumfee!
