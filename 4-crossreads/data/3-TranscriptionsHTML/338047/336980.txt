<p>1919<br/>April 6<br/>At the opposite side of the circle to the staircase there is a Mausoleum dedicated to the dead, with a veiled figure mourning at its foot.  Although only a painting, it is very impressive.  We went to bed early that night, but were so tired that we did not get up till 12 noon.</p>
<p>7 April<br/>We went for a walk around the town &amp; saw the Bastille Monument.  This was erected after the second revolution on the spot where the Bastille used to be.  The Monument in the Place de la Republique showed scars where a Hunnish bomb had dropped &amp; splattered it.  The iron lamp standards nearby were similarly marked.  At night  we went to the Gaumont Picture Palace at Place Clichy.  It is supposed to be the largest in the world, &amp; holds 20,000 people.  We got special concession tickets, being soldiers.  The main boulevards are always full of traffic.  They are wide with wide footpaths lined with trees.  It is just as well that they are wide, for the traffic is go as you please.  Taxis dart here &amp; there speeding up</p>
