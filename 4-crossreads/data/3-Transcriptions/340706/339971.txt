<p>Town Hall &amp; the gendarmerie. I go there &amp; get a billet for night in Hotel de l'Esperance which costs me nothing. I do not relish sleeping in a rough military blanket on the floor when a comfortable bed between sheets is to be had for the asking.</p>
<p>However not liking the look of the hotel &amp; hearing that if I went to any large house &amp; asked for accomodation I could receive it so I walked down the Boulevard near the river &amp; when I had selected the biggest house I went in &amp; asked for owner noting on my way that the word "notaire" appeared on the plate. Monsieur was not in but Madame told me I could speak before her as before her husband. I explained what I had heard &amp; she immediately showed me a room or rather the maid did. I told her I would be back about 9 &amp; left.</p>
<p>In the town I met an English officer &amp; together we went to Caf&eacute; Central which consists of one large room with a balcony running round the top. On ground floor dancing takes place &amp; partners are anyone you like. The orchestra renders good music &amp; in intervals there is two or more paid singers who sing &amp; then make a collection on their own behalf. The scene is lively but the mirth is forced a little it seems to me &amp; has not the spontaneousness one finds in a Parisian caf&eacute; perhaps this is due to the English element or to the proximity</p>
