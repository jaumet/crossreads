We Sisters (13 now) are to go by car   &  our luggage to a Stat. Hosp. until our own C.C.S. is ready for us. We think we are moving North but have no idea where to. Am afraid I shall be recalled to Base. Our O.C. is leaving us   &  we are expecting a new one to arrive to-day. We are awfully sorry to loose our old one but he is going back to Australia. Has been on A.S. nearly three years, so is getting someone to relieve him. He has a charming wife   &  beautiful children, whom he is very anxious to get back to.
