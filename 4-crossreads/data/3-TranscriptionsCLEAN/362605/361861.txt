Dear Dad, Mother, George & Ellis
I expect that Ellis will be Home before this letter as he sailed to Aussie on the old 13th again & I marched out of Bulford to this place on the 13th.  I have a much easier job with a lot more responsibility which does not trouble me now.  I've been over to Bulford this afternoon to get a few things that I had left behind.  I've just received another 5 from the Firm.  The wind & rain during the last few days has been worse than a sou-easter.  It is good over here now & I have more time for study & reading.  I have not the faintest idea when I shall be coming Home so I can give you no information on the subject at present.  I am contented now that one of Us has gone Home, so don't you worry about me.  Ellis would have been in an awful state had He been left, but I can always fill in time.  There is no news to give You.  I am well & happy.
Give my Regards to All enquiring Friends.  I have several letters to write to-night, to Auntie, D.J's & some of my mates in England.
Best Love to you allHarry
