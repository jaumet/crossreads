<p>news of the Australian offensive good, they have had to retreat in disorder leaving many prisoners &amp; guns.  Saw a bomb hole near by of extraordinary size, about 40 ft wide &amp; nearly as deep, it was dropped in the open fields &amp; did no damage.<br/>A large number of sick through, P.U.O's &amp; influenza  and the supplies of asprin is very low, we could only get 1/5 of what we ordered.  An epidemic is apparently raging.<br/>Applications for 1914 men for leave to Australia has been called for &amp; has been rushed, it's a good sign.  Leave to Paris has also opened to a limited degree.  Am now wearing my ribbon, a maroon with 3 white bar.</p>
<p>Thursday 27th June<br/>Fine weather but cool.  The A.D.M.S. on a visit to the Amb. sent for me &amp; congratulated me on the medal, gave the usual kidstakes etc as he had heard all about my good work etc etc.<br/>Fritz over after dark bombing but although, he hovered over us for some time bombs were not dropped within our camp.  Great aerial activity &amp; several scraps of an indecisive nature.  One of ours just managed to escape four huns.</p>
