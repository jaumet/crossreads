<p>Sunday 25 June 1916<br/>Now quartered in a little weatherboard hut built at the back of an old farmhouse which serves as a billet for the men. It has not received much attention from Fritz so far but sooner or later will almost certainly be reduced to ruins as have the other houses hereabouts. Great care has to be exercised constantly lest men moving about be seen by the enemy. The company is stationed at 3 such places not very far apart but there is a good deal of trotting about from place to place. A bright sunny morning but the ground was still very wet underfoot. In the afternoon while having a rest we were rudely interrupted by Fritz sending a number of shells over at an observation station immediately opposite our billet. Fortunately he spent some time over his sighting shots &amp; thus gave us an opportunity to duck out into the trenches close by whence we watched his bombardment, shells landing all round the place. After tea went with Capt. Cotton down the route that we shall have to follow in the event of an attack. It was a perfect evening &amp; a lovely walk with the exception of the parts taking us over duckboards in the trenches. Fairly quiet night later broken by a heavy bombardment from our side.</p>
