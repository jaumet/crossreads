 Shrapnell, ([P??????]) & 5-9 s  Had a couple of narrow escapes.  Got home at midnight & turned in.  Just an item in the nightly life of a modern soldier.  On the way up passed the historic crater that was once Messines.  Nearly a Division of Germans lie buried beneath the great upheaval.  A wonderful tribute to the skill of the Australian Mining Corps. Am to go up again on the same job tonight.
