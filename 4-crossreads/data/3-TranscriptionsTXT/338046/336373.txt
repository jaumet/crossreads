Preface
My chief reason for writing this book, is that my War Diary, though clear enough to me, is unintelligible to anyone else.   The letters, moreover, that I wrote home, are, owing to the Censorship, very sparing in their details, many points being necessarily omitted altogether.
I thought that by combining the diary and letters and enlarging on both, I could produce a narrative that would please at least myself, and possibly interest others.
The idea once germinated, I set about the execution of the work during the early part of the winter of 1922, but many other interests intervening, it was not till October 1924 that the complete story was roughed out.
The style, if it can be called style, varies considerably, as it was written when I was in various humours.   Parts are taken
