A Soldiers Philosophy
One or two things will happen either you will be called as a soldier or not.
If you are not there is no need to worry. If you are, one or two things will happen. Either you will be sent to the front or to a place of safety behind the line.
If you are in a place of safety there is no need to worry, if you are sent to the front one or two things will happen. Either you will be wounded or you wont.
