Tuesday 8 October
Leave London.
Wednesday 9 October
Arrive in Edinburgh on a wet day but still can do the Castle, Royal Mile the Holyrood Palace, all places abounding in history. The Royal Mile however, loses all its historical beauty, by the awful condition of the people living there. George Hotel.
