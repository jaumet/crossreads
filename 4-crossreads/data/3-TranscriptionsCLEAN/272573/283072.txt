go about of miraculous escapes and this voyage has been no exception. True or untrue we have had a miraculous escape. Six ships are said to have been sunk the time we were coming through the Mediterreanean Sea.
Hanging about ship all day long.
About four o'clock in the afternoon we disembarked. We had to march through streets of the city to the station.
The city seemed pretty much like all European cities. High buildings, wide and narrow streets and crowds of children playing about. The people walking up and down the streets seemed as if they had just knocked off work for the day.
Passed a Triumphal Arch built in commemoration of the instituting the French Republic.
We passed a few companies of German prisoners. There would be four or five hundred of them under armed escort, apparently they had been out working and were being taken back to their detention camp.
Went to a High Class Restaurant? Had a cup of tea, a piece of bread and butter for which we were charged 1/8d.
As we were seated there a Military Police Officer came into the Restaurant and spoke to us in a very friendly fashion, warning us to behave ourselves. It appears that the previous night some Aussies had caused a disturbance and this sort of thing had been creating a bad impression on the people of the city.
It is only this last week or two
