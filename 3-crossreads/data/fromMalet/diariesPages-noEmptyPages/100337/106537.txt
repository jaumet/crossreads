heads. All the rest of the day land was in sight on the Starboard side, Late at night we passed Kiama Lighthouse & Jervis Bay Light was to be seen later on. At 9.15 pm all lights on the ship had to be extinguished.

Sunday morning the 8th of October found us well out at sea off the New South Wales coast. Toward evening a slight storm broke over the ship but it did not last long. During the night we passed through Bass-Strait.

We kept good weather until the 11th when we entered the Great Australian bight and ran right into a heavy storm, the waves were breaking right over the forward deck & made everything very wet & miserable, Toward nightfall the storm increased its fury & up to the time I went to bed the wind had been screeming through the rigging & the rain had fallen very heavy.

On the following day the wind & sea had subsided somewhat & travelling was much more comfortable. During the day every man on board had to parade for boat drill with Lifebelts on.
