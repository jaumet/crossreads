<p>of quests &amp; had a sing song.</p>
<p>15th October.  Another year gone &amp; I am to-day 31 years. Morning at Military headquarters, where I spent in contracting indents for supplies. Afternoon to Chronicle, where I met Perris &amp; Shackleton. The latter has agreed to pay me the amount due to me in the morning.</p>
<p>Met Ozzie Webb who is over on leave, dined together, &amp; afternoon at Australia House. Lieut Smart is giving all attention to the preservation of my negatives, &amp; am pleased to see my pictures are receiving great publicity in the press at present &amp; I am receiving many congratulations. Evening with Webb, &amp; several friends to see "The Boy" at the Adelphi.    It was delightfully funny &amp; a pleasant relaxation.</p>
