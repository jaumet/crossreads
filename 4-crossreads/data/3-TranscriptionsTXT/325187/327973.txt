 [Friday 18 August 1916] 
 Before the wounded came here this Hospital was full of unfits [Following paragraph crossed out] Lately arrived as reinforcements from Australia   Sisters say that hundreds are going back out of every batch of arrivals- men who should never have left Australia, some came for the trip, others are really keen but unfit the cost to the people of Australia is about 120/-/- each man, so you see the loss.  Red Cross stuff is run very systematicly now. Once a week an orderly comes with a list- Soap Flywhisks Paper Pencils Tootbrushes  Powder Literature Paper Cigarettes Cards, Games Sweets etc! &amp; each man puts his name down for what he wants.
