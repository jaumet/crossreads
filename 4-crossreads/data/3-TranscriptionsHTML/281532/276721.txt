<p>2/10/18 Nauroy</p>
<p>A fine day. Cavalry advancing were seen by German aeroplanes who called artillery on to them and caused a grand scatter. A look in daylight round these strong positions makes one marvel how the Hun ever was got out of them. Waning morale is the only explanation I can advance. Great landscape views from here &ndash; miles of rolling downs , ruined villages and the Canal du Nord running by all. Went to Bde H.Q. to a Conference at 1530 and there met the General &amp; other battalion commanders. We went into plans for the attack tomorrow morning. The 5th Bde (right) &amp; 7th Bde (left) are doing it. Zero 6.5 am. We shall probably take over the front line the same night. 21 &amp; 22 in front. Hun bombed round here later but our a.a. work in the drizzly rain did no good. Bed 9.30.</p>
