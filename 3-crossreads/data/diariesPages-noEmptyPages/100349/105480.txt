5/11/17.
Moved up to the line and releived the 11th Battalion; at 11 A.M. A new stunt this releiving in daylight. Am in a forward post. With Passchendale on the left front; a very rough "possie". The march into the line distressed me a good deal, fell down several times I have an Idea that shell last month; has fixed me.
7/11/17
Still in the post, have built some cover for we must lay low in the day time. Have been off colour these last couple of days, have a fever. Have to lie in mud so it may be "trench fever" I am down to it. I will get some dope tomorrow
