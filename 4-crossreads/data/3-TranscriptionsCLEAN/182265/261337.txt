  
 Returning to the Stag about 9pm in the twilight. I had supper - Bread & Cheese & a glass of stout. Slept excellently. 
 Friday - Breakfasted & then went to the Bomb School. We spent the morning on Administrative Points & the afternoon at a lecture and a demonstration of a Bombing Attack, at which a very fine air & ground bursting barrage was put up, & several  crate  mines blown up. It rained nearly all the afternoon. We left Lyndhurst about 4.30pm, changed trains at Southampton & reached Codford direct about 6.30pm. Motored to Camp for 5/- 
 Sunday, 2nd July - Cycled in the afternoon through Wylye, across rough roads to Dinton via Baverstock, Teffont & Wylye again. Visited Grovely Wood through which runs an old Roman Road, & Roman ditches & earthworks. 
 Changed (upon C.O.'s orders) our Mess sergeant. I am Mess Secretary.
