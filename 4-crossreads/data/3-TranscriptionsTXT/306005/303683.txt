5-1-17Fri 5thRained again last night; This morning I went to Bde HQs & found Mr Kater was expected at any time, rode along the beach & met Mr Kater & Max Wright returning. Kater said the boat is due at Port Said on the 9th. Soon after tea this evening I went to the 3rd Regt & saw Mr Wint who is going in to catch the same boat & we decided to go in together if possible. he has a pass from the 6th till the 12th, I then went to Bde & applied for the same leave, but Capt Hudson said 4 days was the limit for other ranks & made it out from the 7th till the 11th. I am rather disappointed as Wint & I intended going to Suez together & I shall have to go direct to Port Said now.
