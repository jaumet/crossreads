No. 2 General HospitalMena Cairo.26.3.15.Dearest old Mrs,By mail this week I got letters from you one from the Great Australian Bight dated 16.1.15 & one from 53 Leinster Sq. dated 11.3.15.also letter from Trix of 8th inst & letter & postcard from Margaret also patent cigarette lighter which like all similar contrivances would no doubt be very useful if you were a Robinson Crusoe or if you happened to be in a country where matches were worth &#163;1 a piece.   Here we get a huge box containing 500 matches for half a piastre & they are very much handier than your informal machine.   But joking apart it is quite the best of the numerous lighters that I have seen and I hope to have it near by when I happen to be without matches.Since writing last our plans have changed once more & the latest is that we are likely to be remaining on here for some time longer.  It would however not be advisable to get you over here as our movements are far too indefinite, we haven't the remotest idea what the morrow may bring forth.  I have just come back from sending you a cable addressed Irene Read Westbourne Grove Post Office London "All well still here love self children"   I will try & send you a cable
