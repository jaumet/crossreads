<p>The machine-gunners had made the positions for themselves outside the portion we occupied.&nbsp; It is not possible to chronicle the splendid work done by these.</p>
<p>It will be very hard for some of you to imagine what it would be like to be lying down in cold mud for many hours, straining your eyes watching for any movement of the enemy, bullets flying past and near you the whole time, and shells bursting all around, and not knowing what moment your turn may come to render your final account.</p>
<p>The issuing of rum under these circumstances was most perilous (for the precious liquid).&nbsp; Time and again I would slip on climbing the side of the sunken road to give the man on watch their supply, and along the bottom of the trench I would fall in shell holes which were hidden by the mud and slush, to say nothing of dodging bullets and bursting shells.</p>
