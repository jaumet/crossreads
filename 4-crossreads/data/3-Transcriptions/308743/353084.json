<p>Reveille at 6</p>
<p>Stables as usual then riding under Bert M we went on a touring expedition round the hills we got several miles to the rear [indecipherable] visible from camp &ndash; about 5 miles to the south men explored the catacombs round about, then the quarries these quarries have been in existence for centuries &amp; in some places they run in to the hills for yards &amp; in many cases the hill that once was is leveled to the level of the dessert.  The criminals from the [indecipherable] prison attend to all the quarrying &amp; the worst type are clothed in red to make them conspicuous their boots are also studded in such a manner as to make them a cert for recapture providing they get away.  In the afternoon Harry L &amp; I have the afternoon off so fill in the time at cooking , try two suet puddings &amp; they turn out tip-top only we have to wait until evening parade is over.
