<p>16th March. Thursday 1916</p>
<p>We had fondly imagined that this was to be our permanent Camp for sometime to come but just as we entered it we got the surprising news that we were ordered away up the Nile to another of those "unknown destinations!" Rotten luck we do get and no mistake This is a beautiful place. Nice gardens beautiful shade trees water in abundance near a lovely big City, with plenty of "Donks" to ride on which is great sport and a favourite one of the soldiers You hire a "Donk" and jump on   they don't want much jumping as some of them are only about 3 feet off the ground. and away you go at either a fast amble or a gallop generally the latter with the donkey boy in</p>
