<p>roof I ejaculated &ndash; charming. This discovered everyone to be awake &amp; started them talking but we all went off to sleep again only to be awakened again by another later. No damage however bar a tent.</p>
<p>Friday 15th Dec.<br/>More rain &amp; cold weather. Mud now as bad as ever except when we are using boarding to walk on. One man had a narrow escape. He walked into some mud &amp; found himself sinking, probably into a shell hole into which the mud had run, and before he was rescued by 5 of our chaps, only his head &amp; one shoulder could be seen, another few minutes &amp; he would have been finished. Walking at night off a settled track is impossible &amp; even when on boarding is very risky. The only way possible is to wait for the gun flashes, take a few paces &amp; then wait for the next. Had a case in last night where the femoral artery could be seen beating in the wound, being missed by a hairs breadth. Had it been cut death in the case would have ensued in a few minutes.</p>
