I got your Post-card with Bonne Annee.  I That little girl is pretty I'd like to look like her.  I show'd Mrs. Mcvey and said she'd like too be like it and Mum said that a track would be worn. because all the men would come around to see her.  We have had our tea and Mum has gone to Grandma'ma's to take the letter's we got to-day mum read all them, but not Grandma's.  We have to go to bed at 9.o'clock.
15.9.1918.It is mum's Birth-day today I had nothing for her but Kiss'es.  We went out on Saturday night to the School of Arts.  I went to Church to-day.  I am going to be dressed as a Pretty Maid-en and a boy has to sayWhere are you going my Pretty Maid
I'm going a milking Sir
Mrs. Mcvey came home just for tea on Saturday night and when we went back Mrs Mcvey came down with us to the School of Arts with us. I went to Sunday School this morning but Frank never went.  I And I stayed at home from School all this week.
