midnight, I found the whole place taken up with Tommies going back to France from their leave & dozens of girls were there seeing them off singing & dancing all the time, they were kicking up a great row, while waiting here great trainloads of Yanks kept on coming through they were just off the ships & I was the first Australian they had ever seen so they were greatly interested in me & my uniform  they have been hearing a good bit about the Aussies since the Yanks made that attack with our chaps & they think the Australians are the fighters  they fairly crowded round me as if I was a piece of curiosity & the questions they asked it was very amusing to me, but they are a fine lot of chaps no mistake
