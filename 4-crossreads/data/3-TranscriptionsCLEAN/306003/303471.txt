10-8-16Thurs 10thArrived at Oghratina late last night & dropped to sleep till daylight & some fantasies of water were brought on the scene & we soon made a hole in them, & filled our bottles, then mounted & went about half a mile south of Oghratina to a Hod with several good wells, here we watered our horses & then went to Hod-El-Negliat between Qatia & Oghratina, were issued with rations & slept all day
