MAY 1917
15 TUESDAY
F,ine but very cold in evening
We packed up & moved off
at 10.30 AM & arrived at our
new quarters about midday. The
horselines are in the open & I
have rigged up a bit of a fly
& half a dozen of us camp there.
Took ammunition up at night
Altogether it is not a bad
joint & we have been in
a jolly side worse.
I saw a lot of the preparations
made for the push shortly for
Messines & they are marvellous.
Every tree hides a gun of some
sort & the place is a network
of light railways
I got a parcel of socks ect from
Jo
