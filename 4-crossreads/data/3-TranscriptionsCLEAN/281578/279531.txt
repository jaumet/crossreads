he didn't put many over our way today. Some of the chaps have been sent down to the base, crook with the gas lately. Went out digging as usual at dark, 10.30 p.m.; were at a new spot tonight, the line to be dug was marked out by tape laid on the ground by the engineers.  It was very hard ground, the pick would hardly go in it, let alone a shovel, & it was jolly hard work. My back was aching, when at 2.30 a.m. the welcome order was given "Get your gear on", not that the work was done, but it was beginning to get a bit like daylight, & it wouldn't do for Fritz's 'planes or balloons to spot a big working party.Thursday 6 June The usual routine today, sleeping in our dugouts, reading & eating. If only all this precious time & energy were devoted to production instead of destruction, what a different world this would be. Wish an earthquake would wipe out the Huns, & we could all get back home. His shells again gave us a quiet time today, he is putting a few well back on the road near Corbie. We went out digging again at the same hard ground as last night, & returned at 2.30 a.m. Saw Boo go past with a fatigue party from B Coy.  Friday 7 June Limber
