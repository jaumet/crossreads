<p>Sunday 23.1.16 (31)<br/>Church Parade was very nice this morning &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed it. This afternoon was very slow. We are very impatient now to get ashore &amp; can hardly set our minds to anything. We can see the land on either side now &amp; we still pass a number of ships but we only get their name.</p>
<p>We have lots of reports about stirring events but nothing about Salonica. I will write a letter to Mrs Dobson &amp; then trot off to No 1 Hatch again. I still roll the legs of my pyjamas up, I can't bear them over my legs.</p>
