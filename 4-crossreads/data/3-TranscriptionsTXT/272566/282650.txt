 To A.D.M.S. Reninghelst. To Poperinghe thence A.D.M.S. Reninghelst. The evenings now are very favourable to aircraft and Fritz has been across frequently with bombs, several dropping near our camp.  The C.C.S. referred to in the press lately, where bombs were dropped killing about 60 Germans, is over the road from us.
