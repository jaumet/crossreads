<p>May 22 Another Roo came into the ward last night suffering from eye &amp; ear troubles. This morning we had to undress again &amp; go to bed, just for the Quack to make a cursory groin inspection. Dinkum, it's a prison this joint, although otherwise we are treated alright. Gee i'd love to be back in sunny NSW. Just been to the Aust Store &amp; drew tooth paste, razor etc, jolly handy little place it is. Aunty (Mrs Firth) Mary &amp; Phyllis came along this afternoon &amp; we had a long chat. Rather like them all, &amp; hope to see Uncle later on. Was surprised to see 2 girls because I had forgotten all about Phyl (The Child) Seemed funny too calling Mrs F "Aunt", but spose ill get over that.</p>
