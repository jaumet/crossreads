  
 A big batch of men came in to the O.T.B. from "Hurdcott" today. 31st.  Have got a slight cold in my head the first I have had for ages, they are complaints I seldom suffer from at any time. Well I went over to the OTB on the off chance of seeing Len this afternoon  I thought there might have been the luck for the telegram which I sent last night to get through in time for him to catch the 10.15 from Paddington, he got the wire as a matter of fact the same night at 11.30 & came down to Paddington thinking his train left at 10.35 &  so missed it, he then wired on to Chunder & the Adjutant that he would be down by the 12.27 which he caught, I went down to Warminster & we had some tea in a little joint before the train left.
