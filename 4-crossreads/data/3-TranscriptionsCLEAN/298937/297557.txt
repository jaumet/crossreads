prisoners recently sent to Prisn No. 2.  Average number of 40 oz. bottles sent there daily is 8, & that is quite apart from our own use, ointments, eye & ear drops, special prescriptions & Citadel medicines.  It is not easy for me to keep pace with the rush sometimes, having a very painful foot.
Tuesday 4th April
This afternoon was my holiday, but although the foot is mending, it is not nearly well enough for me to go out.Studied Latin, with which I am improving, & French, with which I am not.
