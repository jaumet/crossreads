<p>trenches.<br/>I was on the 12.30. to 4. relief but nothing of any importance happened except the murder of a large rat by me, the place fairly swarm's with them you can see them all over the place at night time, such big fellows too.<br/>Right close to where I am writing there is the ruins of a large convent the building itself is absolutely smashed to pieces, it must have been a pretty place before the war for a moat surrounded it, &amp; from what I can see of it the Germans almost made a little fort of it only the walls which enclosed this convent are left &amp; they are as you might guess full of shell holes  &amp; falling down everywhere it was in this place that the German's committed some of the worst crimes of the war on the French sisters, &amp; the girl students who were living there at the time of the German invasion</p>
