Went &amp; dug Dad Hunter &amp; after lunch we went &amp; had a look at a game of football 'tween 4th &amp; 5th Div.  5th won by 4 points. Went to a fancy dress &amp; masked ball at the Gym. Went as Bo peep. Some scream too. The show was excellent. Some lovely costumes there. Enjoyed it immensely. Supper too was good.
