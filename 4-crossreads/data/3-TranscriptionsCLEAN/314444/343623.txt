We are not in the line at present because our Chaps are advancing all along the line. I am looking forward to the Hun sending out a big peace offensive soon because next year he will have "Buckleys" chance. There are Americans here all over the place & they are a fine body of men. Things are a lot different to when you were here it is not so hard as everything is perfection. We will win yet Hal old Boy so cheer up & look forward to seeing my handsome dial before very many months have passed. Since Jack came
