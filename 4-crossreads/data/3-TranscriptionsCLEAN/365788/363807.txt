1st Field AmbulanceMudros WestLemnos. Is.9 Oct 15My dearest Sister,It seems so very uncertain what our future movements will be that I will cancel the suggestion which I made in a previous letter to you about sending my letters to 2nd Stationary Hospital. Please send them till further notice to No. 2 General Hospital as before & they will forward them. Please ring up Trix & Neil Sherwin & tell them - Absolutely no news - but will write now & then to let you know I am well. Much love to you all,Your loving brother,Fred
