 Digger 's Conscienc Prick Him ! " Souvenir " or "rat " German prison of war was one of the minor pastim of the Digger dure the 1914-'18 troubl . Some Digger were more keen on it than other . The " Souvenir King " stop at noth . There is on record the case of the Digger who souvenir a motor cycl , which he dismantl and brought back . When he land at the wharf at Sydney he reassembl it and push it off to his home . There is no record of a German aeroplan or motor wagon have been brought home , but that was main becaus of lack of opportun . Mani a good Bosch magneto was detach from a plane and taken away . Wonder what a handi tool the bayonet prove itself to be ? from use as a toast fork to fell tree . Near everi Digger who was in Franc and Belgium brought back " souvenir " of some kind . Field glass , revolv , watch , and Iron Cross were the favorit in the field . Photograph from German wallet are to be found to this day in mani a Digger home . But the Digger of to-day is look back on the impetuos of his youth and find therein food for thought . As he turn over his " souvenir " in the presenc of the kid , he find it rather difficult to explain to them how he came by the more or less intim famili photograph of a lot of Frauen and Fraulein . And of what use are they to him , anyway ? So begin the great movement back to Germani of the photograph and post card "rat " sixteen , seventeen , and eighteen year ago . It is difficult to gaug whether the chang is due to that " conscienc which doth make coward of us all , " or whether it is prompt by a kindlier feel , after the laps of time , toward our ex-enemi . If it grow to the extent which it promis , " Smith 's Week " will have to declin the honor of establish the bureau through which the " Souv " are return to their origin owner . That , after all , is a government duti . The Govern sent the Digger over there and it was at the Govern 's behest that the boy captur the prison . It is not suggest for one minut that the Govern instruct the boy to "rat " the prison ; but , if it did not want the prison "rat " , it was up to the Govern to prevent it . Here is a letter receiv by " Smith 's " which show how serious some of the Digger are now take their citizenship : Maxwelton Farm , Coolgarra . Editor , " Smith 's Weekly" , Sydney . Dear Sir , Some time back I read an interest articl in your paper of a Digger who sent some photograph back to a German soldier . Dure our advanc on the St .

But as year roll on a person stop to think that the owner of those photo would appreci them all the more now , so I am enclos them so as you can send them along to their owner . I do not understand German or els I would send them on myself . There was write on most of the card but it has disappear for the past two year . I am sure that the German soldier would quit understand that all [indecipher ? end of the column of the press cut torn ] person would never think about do under ani other circumst .

His rank in the German Armi was that of a sergeant and he wore in his tunic the ribbon of the Iron Cross . Some of the photograph are bad fade ; but there is a rollick group taken round a case label " Schultheiss Bier" , while off at the side of the pictur a man may be seen roll a barrel of what may reason be presum to be beer from out the door of a cellar . In the centr of the group is a fir tree , at the base of which are beer bottl , and in the foreground are two basket fill with what also look like bottl of beer . So it seem that Father Christma had visit the Sergeant ? Mess of Sergeant Jung 's regiment .
