23/9/15 Gallipoli
The coldest morning yet. Stood to arms for an hour with a wind like ice. Sea very pretty all flecked with white horses. Stood watching our shells bursting on Abdul ? watched until their sniper moved me on. Bitterly cold up on these heights. We look right down on Braunds Hill. The hillsides are getting quite denuded of brushwood. Imbros in the distance and the high peak of Samothrace towers out of the water in the distance. Warships signalling by electric lamp. Piercingly cold wind ? cloudy. Went up into front line and watched shells from our siege battery landing on enemy front line. Not a Turk in sight and one gentleman remarked "We'll Allah them ? we have frightened c - out of them." Lovely moonlight night ? the view magnificent. Turks at work repairing their damaged trenches
