<p>rolled on ball about 5 feet in diameter against the dining-hall door at Camp &amp; when the orderlies opened the door at lunch time this thing confronted them &amp; it took quite a while to get it shifted. This ball lasted for over a week &amp; is still there though somewhat diminished in size. In the afternoon we had a short march to warm us up &amp; were then lectured by the Medical Officer.</p>
<p>In the Evening we had a seat near the Salvation Army fire, did a bit of writing &amp; with our last coppers had some supper. Alan &amp; I had 1/2d each when we landed in England and I picked up 3d in one of the huts here, so we just had enough to buy a nice cup of tea &amp; a cake each. But pay day won't be long in coming now.</p>
