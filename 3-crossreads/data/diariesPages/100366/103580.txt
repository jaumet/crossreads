Still raining & windy & very unpleasant generally. I kept indoors as much as possible to try & keep warm. Our stove was fed with coke until it became white hot.

There has again been a disruption in the Train owing to O.C. ordering a Staff Sgt to revert to his former rank of Corporal. He is lodging a general complaint & we are all watch the result with interest. Fighting is very quiet on account of the rough weather which makes all observations impossible.

7.10.16 Saturday.
These two days have been occupied in moving camp again. It was decidedly a very annoying & disheartening order as we were very comfortably situated for all wet weather having a nice big room, but now we have to go & live under a tarpaulin again. However after a fairly strenuous time we managed to rig one on a frame work of wood. It was a solid job as it was raining & windy & each time we managed to get it in place the wind would get it & away it would go.
