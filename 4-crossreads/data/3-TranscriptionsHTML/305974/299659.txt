<p>26 Thursday<br/>We are all busy packing up this morning.  It is still very wet &amp; dreary.  Yesterday we went up to Mont des Cats monastry &amp; had a look through it, it is now used for a clearing stn.  A very old &amp; <strike>big</strike>  large place on top of a very large hill, it is a splendid view from the top.  We left Goderwaersvelde about 9.30 am &amp; arrived at Caestre about 12.30 pm.  Entrained left about 2.30 pm for Pt Remy (about 3 miles from Abbeyville.  We came round by Calais, Boulogne, Etaples &amp; Abbeyville.  It took us just about 12 hours. Travelling in vans.  The whole Fld Amb &amp; Transport nearly took up a whole train.</p>
<p>27 Friday<br/>  We arrived at Pt Remy about 2 am &amp; marched to our billets in a village called Monflieres.  Still very wet. Slept all the morning, very tired.  I have a pretty bad cold, but it is getting better now.  Went through the church here (R.C.).  They always have a nice church no matter how big the village, I suppose it is on account of the one religion.</p>
<p>28 Saturday<br/>General Parade &amp; Roll call in the morning.  Went into Abbeyville with Fred Ryan in the morning &amp; we stopped all day getting back to camp about 9 pm.  Abbeyville is about 4 miles from here &amp; is a very large place.  There is nothing of interest though bar the Catherdal (R.C.) &amp; the Triangle.  We went through the Catherdal &amp; nearly all over the town.  Had a real good time.</p>
<p>29 Sunday<br/>There were 4 officers &amp; 4 sergeants presented with service recognition cards this morning.  The O.C. complimented the whole Ambulance on its work since being in France.  We are getting very poor food.  Very cold.</p>
