January
1:  Busy day, preparing to move to-morrow for Egypt.  Glad to get away.
2:  Left Lemnos at 10 a.m., boarding "The Empress of Britain" - 4000 on board. Good quarters & food for all. Stayed in harbour all night.
3:  Steamed out at 9 a.m.  Word that Persic had been sunk that day.
6:  Reached Alexandria 4 p.m. after a good trip.  Baggage guard on wharf.
7:  Left at 3 a.m. in cattle trucks with baggage; officers in first class cars & a dining car.  Reached Tel el Kebir at noon.  100,000 under canvas here. This is where the battle between the British & Dervishes took place on Sept. 13; 1882.  Many British men & officers are buried here in the cemetery specially erected by the British.
9:  Rations very poor, dry bread, date & tea which get monotonous.  Went to the old trenches used in the action of 1882 & the boys unearthed a few ancient coins & other interesting souvenirs.
