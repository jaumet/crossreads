The name of the place was Marianbad? -se Buchy. Buchy was a Convalescent Camp at which many of our men convalesced after leaving hospital. We made tea with some of our iron rations. I thought at the time that the tea sugar and bully beef were a very nice thought on the part of the heads, to give the boys a good time on the train but afterwards discovered that I had eaten and drunk away my "iron rations" - only to be used in case of exceptional emergency. The train travelled on. The next place I remember was Doullens and after that St Pol and Hazebrouck. This place was the first Australian HQ in France. the Eighth Brigade when first it arrived in France was camped at Morbecke, about two kilos from Hazebrouck.While stopped in the railway yards
