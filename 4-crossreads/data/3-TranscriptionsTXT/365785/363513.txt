 been doing splendid work down on the left flank lately.  A report came out this morning that the hill 971 has been taken, will be a great help to us if it is correct.  I get all mail regular here now, no letters have been lost up to date.  I think I have told you all the news at present.  Not allowed to give any information.  I shall say good bye for the present, hoping this note reaches you safely &amp; finds you well. 
 I Remain Yours Faithfully C. Sanders
