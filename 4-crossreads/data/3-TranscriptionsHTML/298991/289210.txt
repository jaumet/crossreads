<p>Tuesday Sept 4th<br/>A very fine day. Had nothing to do all day, so I came off lucky. Went to Easton this afternoon, but it is very quiet in there.</p>
<p>Wednesday Sept 5th<br/>Was fine this morning, but rained nearly all this afternoon, &amp; also came over very misty. I have been playing billiards constantly this last few days, &amp; am getting quite an expert at it. The Red cross has two fine tables in this camp. Went to the pictures in the Gym this evening, not too bad. Picked for guard for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thursday Sept 6th<br/>Went on guard 9 a.m this morning on the detached guard. There are only three sentries, a corporal &amp; a mess orderly. I was mess orderly, but all the jobs were very easy. The sentries only done 4 hrs 40 mts out of the 24 hrs. Doing mess orderly for the five was very easy. Went to the pictures in the Gym tonight. They were not up to much, but a couple of hrs can be passed away going to things like that in this camp.</p>
