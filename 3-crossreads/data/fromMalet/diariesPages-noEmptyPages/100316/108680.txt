over to the Transport Lines there to see our collection of war trophies. There is a fine lot of German light and heavy machine guns and also many other trophies captured. Old Geddes was sitting on these guns and was the picture of Faithfulness watching over them. Our painter Needham is a character and gaily decorates all the grave crosses for the Regiment. Returned to Bn H.Q. and there met Colonel Cohen. We sat once more as a Court of Inquiry regarding the "shorts" of the artillery barrage and we examined many artillery officers. One could but be struck with the fine type of men these battery commanders are. Vast experienced smart capable chaps and very full of skill, in gun handling. Just as we finished Mess in the evening in walked Jacky Rohn, Davis Chalmers and others. So we had quite a reunion. After mess I had a busy evening interviewing different ones and had several chaps who wished an understanding with me about different troubles. Later in the evening we had a good air raid and the planes kept circling round and round flying so low that we could plainly hear their engines and dropping plenty of bombs upon us. Some of the explosions shook my house to its foundations. Received a letter of congratulation from the Army Commander on our work in collecting intelligence. They got the plans for an attack and several maps of importance from Ville sur Ancre.
