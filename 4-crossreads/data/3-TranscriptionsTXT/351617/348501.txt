[Buckingham Palace letterhead]Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Men of the Oversea Forces: -
It is with a heart full of pride and gratitude that I take your salute to-day as you march in triumph through London.
The Peoples of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, by their instant readiness to share in the trials and responsibilities of the great War, have shown to the World the unity of the British Empire.
You, with your comrades from the Mother Country, vied with one another in noble deeds, which will ever be held in proud remembrance.
Readily you adapted yourselves to the changing conditions of a new and formidable kind of warfare, and endured physical hardships and exacting mental strain.
Whether on the plains of Flanders, or the heights of Gallipoli, in France, in Palestine, or other theatres of war, you displayed gallant endurance in defence and vigorous initiative in attack.
We and future generations will never forget the part played by the Canadians in the second Battle of Ypres, and on the Vimy Ridge, by the Australians and New Zealanders at Gallipoli and in the advance in France in the spring of 1917, by the Troops of all three Dominions in the breaking of the Hindenburg line last year, by the South African Brigade in Delville Wood, and by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment at Monchy le Preux.
Now, in the day of victory, I wish to express to you, who represent the Oversea Forces, my unbounded admiration for splendid feats of arms and for sacrifices made.
I wish you all God-speed on your homeward journey, with a hope that the outcome of this world struggle may assure Peace to your children and your children's children.
[Signature of George R. J.]May 3rd, 1919.
