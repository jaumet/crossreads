<p>(43)<br/>Ploegsteert forest is, or was a well kept oak forest about 1&frac14; miles long by a mile. It was evidently used as a hunting forest, whom by I don't know, but some say by King Albert. Of course all forests are put to a commercial use by cutting trees and undergrowth methodically.</p>
<p>The trees were much damaged by shellfire but not by the troops who were forbidden to do so by prominent notices. It afforded excellent cover for our approaches to the front line, many duckboard tracks leading hither and thither through the forest where otherwise trenches would have been necessary. According to Sgt SR Crooks (brave man now dead alas) arrangement we spent four days at each of the four r.a.ps with two days in between each down at the ads. So I spent the 2nd and 3rd of April at Charing Cross and then on 4 April went up to Rifle House where conditions were much the same as at Dead Horse. Both places were about 500 yards behind the front line near the "second support" trenches. Our reveille was usually about 9am then two would do the "housework" and two go down to the ADS for ratio and fuel.</p>
