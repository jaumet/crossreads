<p>SBY 5/6/18</p>
<p>O noble tree, so stately and so proud,<br/>That hurled a scornful challenge to the wind,<br/>Alas! too soon thy leafy head is bowed,<br/>To puny mortal's needs thy life assigned</p>
<p>I watch the flame a-glowing in the night,<br/>And know that what thou wer't thou art no more,<br/>A heap of ashes mark thy proud delight,<br/>As "dust to dust" laughs Nature's mocking law.</p>
