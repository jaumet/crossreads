<p>Sunday 11th November 1917</p>
<p>Lunch Laura at 1.30 at her Flat &ndash; she is always on the go somewhere &amp; so never fattens. Dr. JAGGER sends her for an operation on Tuesday Tonsils to be cut, &amp; she goes to a nursing home for a week, more expense for her. I read Day's letter of September &amp; glad to hear alls well at home &amp; you have been to Wangaratta. Can you tell me if that LOCOMOTIVE toy of Joe's is at Bronte. Laura &amp; I were talking about it today.</p>
