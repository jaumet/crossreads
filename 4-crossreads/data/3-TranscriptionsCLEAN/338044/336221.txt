  
 rum to-night is going to put me right 
 1st August:- Tuesday Having to report at Headquarters at 9 am for instructions we are about early    & off by 8.30 am train to Waterloo Station after a good breakfast. Transpires that the usual hanging round for a few days is to take place    & we are to await further instructions from the War Office for travelling facility. To report again at 5 pm. Straight to Peel House & remove all my kit. Take a taxi to Grosvenor Gardens & leave all my kit there   Now have it together ready to depart at any notice. Take the tube to Mansion House    & Lake visits his old employers in this district, East C. I think   We meet here a fellow worker of his, who has been badly knocked about, his hand still paralysed. We lunch well
