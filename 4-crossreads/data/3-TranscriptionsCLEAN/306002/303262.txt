  
 25.8.15 Wed. 25th.  The weather has been inclined to be stormy the last few days & heavy clouds have been going over us but only a few sprinkles have fallen;  heavy bombarding has been going on around Cape Helles.  I suppose the boats are still banging away at Achi-Baba.  It is rumored that the boats are bombarding the Narrows & Achi-Baba for three days & then our Monitors are going to try a dash through the Narrows.  We went on duty at Hinton's out-post again a dinner time to-day.  Smithers is a little better to-day & is going on duty with us again tonight.  Popes was shelled today but no damage done.
