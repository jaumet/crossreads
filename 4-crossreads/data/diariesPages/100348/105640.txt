that have been stiffened with Prussian troops. They say they are sick of the treatment they receive from the overbearing Prussians.
8/11/16.
Was releived last night after another, nightmare day. Company Head Quarters drank the rum issue and got dead drunk; so the releif was go-as-you-please. The whole company got lost in this wilderness of mud. It took me hours to stagger out to an English Battery near Longwall. I think I fell a hundred times, but was with some other chaps who helped me up. The English gunners treated us handsomely; gave us rum and food and cigarettes. We all felt better then and laid down in the rain and slept till daylight. Found the Battalion in Trones Wood.
