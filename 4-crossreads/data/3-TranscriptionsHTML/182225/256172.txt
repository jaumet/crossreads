<p>A Toast to the &quot;Reliable&quot; Man.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s to the steadfast reliable man</p>
<p>The man with the tongue that&#39;s true</p>
<p>Who wont promise to do any more than he can</p>
<p>But who&#39;ll do what he says he&#39;ll do</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He may not be clever; he&#39;s often quite blunt</p>
<p>Without either polish or air;</p>
<p>But though its not in him to &quot;put up a front&quot;,</p>
<p>When you need him he&#39;s always there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here&#39;s to the man on whome one can rely,</p>
<p>And here&#39;s to his lasting success</p>
<p>May his species continue to multiply</p>
<p>And his shaddow never grow less</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
