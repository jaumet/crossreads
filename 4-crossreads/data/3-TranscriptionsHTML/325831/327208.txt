<p>We are in this show <u>to win</u>, &amp; having her hand to the plough Australia <u>cannot turn back</u>.</p>
<p>This war is the best thing that has ever happened to Australia. She is now a <u>Nation</u> recognised by the whole world, &amp; what Country was ever yet any good that had not fought for its Nationhood. The price in manhood is high, but the game is worth it. Unfortunately so many of the best have gone &amp; the worst, "the Nosers" are sad to say left behind to breed the future generation of Australians, but thank the Lord <u>All</u> those who have come here are not going to be killed &amp; their influence must be felt later on. I must say I was a bit surprised at the Soldier Vote, but the matter was not properly explained to them, &amp; the Union's raucous voice reached them even here. Some politicians addressed a few <u>after</u> the Vote was taken.</p>
<p>In London I was speaking to a lady, the wife of a NSW squatter, &amp; she told me her husband &amp; all the Station voted "No" because if more men were sent away the labor trouble would be increased; that already they could not get sufficient labor to take the wool off the sheeps back. I remarked that this was a purely personal view point &amp; that it did not seem to be realised that this was a war for national existence &amp; that if the Boche came out on top there would probably be NO sheep to shear at all. But it's the same everywhere &ndash; personal interest &amp; personal gain.</p>
<p>On 1st January I assumed command of the 4th Australian Division with rank of Major-General, &amp; this will be my address in future. I have now 20,000 instead of 4,000. I succeeded a most distinguished Indian Army General (Sir H V Cox) who has gone to England as Military Adviser to the Secretary of State for India. My staff consists principally of British &amp; Indian Army Officers. One of my two A.D.Cs is a son of Mr Justice Ferguson of Sydney. I am very happy indeed in my new Command but the responsibilities are of course enormously increased, but you know I never shrink from responsibility, though I realise what a difficult matter it is to follow such a distinguished &amp; experienced a soldier as General Cox who has served in all parts of the world for 38 years.</p>
