 The fight was between 4 British and 4 German planes, it lasted for half an hour before any of them showed any sign's of wanting to get away, and all of a sudden, that is after a lot of good manouvering one German machine fell and a cheer went up from the boys, not long after the second German plane went tumbling to the ground so the other two fled for their lives.  It was a splendid fight.
