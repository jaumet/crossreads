<p>or other wise &ndash; A lot more A.G.H. men came into Camp from No 4 Auxillary Hospital &ndash; no doubt they will make field men of these as there are no wounded coming in at present. 1st L.H.F.A. have orders today to be in readiness to march out. I am glad of this, as it looks as tho the L.H. are going to garrison Egyt &amp; L.H.F.A. attached. Myself &amp; other Boys are seriously considering a transfer to Artillery.</p>
