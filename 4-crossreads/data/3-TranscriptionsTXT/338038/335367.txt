 France 29.6.17 My dear Father, 
 This is perforce a very short letter, but I want to let you know all is well with me and also acknowledge your very welcome letters of 15th &amp; 29th Apl, received this week. I think a letter be it ever so brief is more satisfactory than a F.S. postcard. 
 We are going into the line tonight and will be busy for a few days learning our country. I think it will be a quiet spot as its just an ordinary "holding the line" job &ndash; 
 Am writing Mum by this mail. 
 Hoping you are quite well, I am your loving Son Terence
