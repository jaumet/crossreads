 three shots just passed over where I am writing this I will move into my dug out. We had a very heavy storm last night and the landing piers on the beach have all been washed away so I expect we will not have our usual rations this week, I think there are a lot of spies going about here as they put up some condensers to change the salt water for drinking purposes and our beach party had no sooner got it erected than the turks put a hole right through one of the big cisterns the transport of water here is very different as it all has to be taken from&nbsp;wells and it is very tiresome work. We hear of another mine gone up round on the right flank losses 270 men including 4 Doctors most all buried alive, went past the cemetery today and the shovels were very busy indeed, 4th Brigade have gone away for their spell I wish it was the 5th but all in good time.&nbsp;they send them to Lemnos Island just out of gun shot but a least you get a full nights rest with no alarms to trouble you, Going down to the beach to-morrow for the mail
