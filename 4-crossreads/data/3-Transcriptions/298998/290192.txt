<p>the French. I noticed one paragraph worthy of comment. <strike>which is</strike> --   It contained a list of the casualties inflicted upon the British air service, during one week. The number brought down, exceeded the aggregate of machines employed on the whole Somme front. The report referred to one sector only. I read many similarly exaggerated and absurd reports, but they are not worth paper space. The papers are no doubt, editored according to Hun dictation.

They lack courage and coolness, this I have experienced both at the Front and here. (England er alles schwindler, England er sweinori) followed by storms of "Donnerwotter" are the only remarks received in reply to a question. If one</p>
