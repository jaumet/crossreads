<p>as yesterday.  Drill &amp; company work stretcher drill, loading of wagons adlib almost to heart breaking point as all done in deep sand &amp; sun very hot.  Saw a good exhibition of buck jumping in fact these are being quite common as a lot of new mules have arrived.  Usual swim during afternoon.</p>
<p>Thursday 11th May<br/>The same drill as before only we set off with full packs up &amp; did a march across the sand.  Half holiday during afternoon.  At night we were warned of a projected attack on the enemy for which we had to start off at midnight.  Lights out at 8.30 P.M in official language 20.30.  The Colonel gave us an outline of the operation as a help as all would be conducted under cover of darkness no lights, smoking, or talking allowed.  Pass word "Anzac"</p>
