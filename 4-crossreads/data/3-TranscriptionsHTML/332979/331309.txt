<p>ourselves when we are on our long leave, we were supposed to have 6 days &amp; instructions received it was cut down to 4 days which was a disappointment to all of us as we all looked forward to 6 days enjoyment after our long voyage to England. After Dinner 6 of us went for another walk to a Village called Headley. About 1&frac34; miles, the journey was very interesting, the Roads wind around, hardly a straight line of road was encountered for any distance. Turf thrown up on each side between the Homesteads made the dividing line which was covered with Hedges &amp; Hazel Nut Bushes which was very interesting to the Eye, along the Road I came across one Old Mill built over a Waterway, the Water was used to drive a Wheel to cut Chaff &amp; corn.</p>
