<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>Many many thanks for your letters &amp; cards posted on 12th Jany, and also card from Pat, just received. Tomorrow will be the 15th, and I suppose I will become a man, but all the same won't I miss the little procession to the bedroom in the morning, which always marked our birthdays at home.<br/>The letters were simply great and I am very glad to hear you are well and that Sis is progressing favourably.<br/>We are fairly busy this week. 1st Reinforcements just arrived and being posted to their various Units, to fill up wastage in men</p>
