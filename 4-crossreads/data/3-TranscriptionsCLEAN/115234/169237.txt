What did you do in the great war, Daddy
The childish treble rings
Hush, child ask questions not
For I did many things
Know ye babe your pater braves
An Anzac Jack was he
Who in Edgeware Rd was a customer bold
When the publican's beer was free
What did I do in the great war Child
Tis, well that you should know
