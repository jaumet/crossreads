 Sunday 24 June 1917 
 Sitting here on the Beach reminds one of years ago when we waited for the Julia PERCY  with Father on board  coming to Warrnambool. 
 I could give you interesting details of RAIDS etc., but one thing Censor would not permit &amp; I think you are more interested in the little things of our daily life. We have now a PLAGUE OF CRICKETS &ndash; 100s of them in every Bivy, supposed to be good luck aren't they?  Lets hope so. Went to Church Parade but owing to the roar of the surf could hear nothing.  I thought of you, bravely walking home from the old Church in D'quin.
