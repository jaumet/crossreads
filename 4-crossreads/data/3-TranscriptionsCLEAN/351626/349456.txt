money  of over here while on furlough as I had about 35 to draw.  I have a month's furlough   & have about 5 on my book to draw now.  I hope you are all O.K at home.  I have not had any letters for about a month or so. I suppose you got my letters. I write about once a fortnight or three weeks but of course sometimes to  [indecipherable]  or Brisbane.There are 250 men leaving for Australia to-day and also about 300 for Egypt, but I will be here some time yet I am afraid.With love to all fromYour affectionate SonCharlie
