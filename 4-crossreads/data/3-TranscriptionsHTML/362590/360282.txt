<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>I regret very much that I was unable to accept your kind invitation to dine with you last night but the ship was taken into the stream early in the evening &amp; I felt that my place was on board with the men, I had a telephone message sent with my apology which I trust you received.</p>
<p>I may mention that the men are very indignant at the disparaging statement in the paper re NSW men, as you know I put them on their honor with regard</p>
