It is also said that all the alli Prisoners-of-War have top be repatri to their respect countri . if this report is true I should be on my way to England veri soon . The revolutionist are veri quiet late , The movement must either have fallen through , or els the paper will not publish what is go on . It is report in the paper that England is command Holland to hand the Ex-Kaiser and Crown Princ over to her , This report I do not beleiv . The foodstuff and other articl are get scarcer and scarcer , Sinc the Armistic the food that the German Anchor give us has been a littl better , but it is still veri bad . Novemb 20thThe report late confirm the statement of last week about the repatri of all Alli Prisoners-of-War back to their respect countri , One or two of the Work Commando ?s around here have alreadi return their prison to Soltau Lager . I expect to be leav here veri soon . The Paper say that the German Armi is evacu all French and Belgian territori , They have to be over the Rhine by the 9th of Decemb . The German soldier are leav Franc of their own accord and are sell hors and other thing to anybodi who will buy them . For the last few day it has been veri frosti and cold . On the 24th we had some slight snow fall . The follow is an address given to a bodi of Englishmen by the Anchor Command of a larg Prison Lager . The Govern are go to issu it in circular form to everi English and American Prisoner-of-War leav the countri . GentlemenTh war end for you as soon as you becam Prisoner-of War . But now it has end for the whole world . A littl longer and you will see your nativ land again , Your home , your love one , your friend . You will onc more take up your accustom work . The fortun of war brought you as prison into our hand . You were freed even against your will from fight , from danger , from death . But the Joy of peac could not be your for there was no Peac . Now Peac is come and Peac mean liberti . When you are Anchor Novemb alreadi unit to your famili , Thousand of our countrymen will still be pine in far-off prison-camp with heart as hungri for home as your . You have suffer in confin , who would not ? It was the fate of everi prison in everi prison-camp of the world to eat his heart out with long , To chafe against loss of liberti , To suffer from Homesick , brood , discourag , Blank despair . The day , the week , the weari year crept by , and there was no end in sight . There were mani discomfort , irrit , misunderstand . Your situat has been a difficult one . Our own has been desper . Our countri blockad , Our civil popul suffer from want of proper and suffici food and materi , The enorm demand made upon our harrass land from everi side , - These and mani other afflict made it imposs to do all that we should Anchor Novemb have like to do . Under the circumst we did our best to lessen the hardship of your lot , to insur your comfort , to provid you with pastim , Employment , Mental and bodili recreat . It is not like that you will ever know how difficult our circumst have been . We know that error have been commit and that there has been hardship for which the former system was to blame . There have been wrong and evil on both side . We hope that you will alway think of that , - and be just . You enter the old Empire of Germani ; you leav the new Republ , The newest and , as we hope to make it , the freest land in the world . We are sorri that you saw so littl of what we were proud of in the former Germani , - Our Arts , Our Scienc , Our Model Citi , our theatr , School , Anchor Novemb Industri , our social institut , as well as the beauti of our sceneri and the real soul of our peopl , Akin in so mani thing to your own . But these thing will remain part of the new Germani . Once the barrier of Artifici hatr and misunderstand have fallen , We hope that you will learn to know , in happier time , the Grander featur of the land whose unwil guest you have been . The barb wire enclosur is not the proper point of view from which to judg or survey a great nation . The War has blind all nation , but if a true Peac will result in open the eye of the peopl to the fact , that their intrest are common , That no differ in Flag , Govern , Speech nor nation , can alter the great truth of fratern of all men , This war will not then have been fought in vain . If the Anchor Novemb Peopl at last realiz that it is not each other who are their enemi , But the ruthless forc of Imperial and Capit , of Militar of all sort , Of Jingo Journal that sow falshood , hatr and suspicion , Then this war will not have been fought in vain , Then Peac will not have been establish in vain . We hope that everi one of you will go home carri a messag of good will , of concili , of enlighten . Let all men in our new epoch go forth as missionariesof the new evangel , as interpret between nation and nation . The Valiant dead who onc fought against each other , have long been sleep as comrad side by side in the same earth . May the live who onc fought against each other labour as comrad on this self same earth . This is Anchor Novemb the messag with which we bid you farewel . In the name of the German Republ . Anybodi read this address would come to the conclus that we had had a veri comfort time in Germani . But It has not been so . When I first enter the countri everi person was war mad . They had no idea that they would eventu go under . At that time it was Deutschland uber all . Germani over all . You onli have to take the Hymn of hate , to tell you what sort of a feel the popul had for Englishmen . Sinc the Armistac , and the peopl can see that they are beaten , they ask us to take a messag of goodwil home with us , If I had my way I would start the war again and smash the countri Anchor Novemb about like they smash Franc . Just tri and Pictur Germani in our posit on the win side , How much merci do you think we would receiv at their hand , What chanc would we Prison have of get out of the countri for year to come , if ever we got out aliv at all . We would be treat exact the same as they treat the French prison when they liber Franc in 1890 . On the 25th I start work for the first time sinc the news of the Armistac . When we stop work the German stop our food , We continu to live on the food that we receiv from England in our parcel , but these last three day we have run out of suppli so have start again until some more parcel come along . On Wednesday the 27th I again stop Anchor Novemb work . I went to the Doctor with four other Englishmen , We were all suppos to have cold , The Doctor said he could see that we were not sick , and ask us all to have a littl patienc , and said that we would be all sent to the Concentr Lager as soon as there was room for us , and we could be spare from the factori . He order us to work , so when we arriv back at the Factori , we decid not to do ani more work for Germani . The follow day all of us were move from this factori to the branch factori at the other end of town . The manag said that by refus to work we were set a bad exampl for the other Prison , So we were pack off and out of the way . At this new place we are do noth but eat , sleep , and read . I get up at about 10 or 11 o?clock everi day . Our food is not stop now , I suppos the German Anchor Decemb think that they had better feed us for the last few day that we are to be in their countri . On the 4th of Decemb I left Luneburg for Soltau Lager togeth with all the Prison that were work at both the Salin Factori . The men from almost all the work Commando ?s have been recal to Soltau Lager . I arriv at Soltau at about 10pm and got an issu of Parcel straight away . In Soltau there is almost 1,000 Englishmen , and it is the biggest bunch of British that I have seen in Germani . We all expect to be leav for England veri soon , We may get word to pack up and move ani day now . I receiv a photo of Etta to-day . For the past week we have had a lot of rumour about leav for England but up to the present none of them have come true . Anchor Decemb The camp is in an aw state , There doe not seem to be anybodi in charg of affair sinc the revolut has upset thing . When I was last in Soltau camp you could not see a speck of paper blow about , But now there is heap and heap of rubbish lay around everywher . A lot of the barrack have been pull down and the timber use to light fire to do our cook with . Sick is veri preval in the camp , Two Englishmen die yesterday with the Spanish Gripp or Influenza . Last night the 10th I went to see the morn pictur , The show is insid the Camp enclosur and is manag by a German . It was the first morn pictur show that I have seen sinc I left Australia over two year ago . Inside the build was a notic that ran thus ? ?It is vorbitten to smoke be everi infecti and strong ( And also anoth which ran thus: - ?Pleas take your hat off . Anchor Decemb The german who wrote these notic no doubt thought that he was fair well up in the knowledg of the English Languag . On about the 18th a Frenchman was shot dead by a German sentri just outsid my hut . The bullet enter his stomach and pass out halfway down his thigh . The men who saw him shot said that the German deliber shot him for noth at all . They said that he was just walk along whistl to himself . He was buri on the 20th . The German gave him a decent burial , They had the Band and fire parti and buri him with full militari honour in the cemeteri adjoin the Camp . On the night of Decemb the 21st we weer offici order to get readi to leav Soltau to-morrow the 22nd Part V Decemb 1918 On the 22nd we left Soltau Railway Station by the 9.30 am train , We travel via the town of Luneburg and Hamburg and arriv at Hamburg at about 3 pm . I did not see much of the citi of Hamburg but what I did see was veri fine inde . The build are beauti , and all the street are well made and veri wide , It also seem to be kept veri clean . We Embark on the troopship Citi of Poona , and remain moor at the wharf all night . The British destroy Radient was moor alongsid and act as escort to us . At 8am the follow day we proceed on down the river Elbe , and anchor about 20 mile lower down the river from the German Naval base at Cux-haven , The weather outsid was too foggi for us to cross the German mine field with safeti . We were also issu with a new uniform and undercloth . On Tuesday the 24th ( Christma eve ) we were anchor all day owe to the Decemb weather be too tough and foggi to ventur out with safeti . On Christma day we weight anchor and were on our way at 9.30am . The water was full of float contact mine , Some of them were pass veri close . They are I should think about seven feet in diamet and are paint black , they have a lot of larg spike project out from their side . The Captain and crew were fire at them with rifl to tri and explod or sink them , They did not succeed in hit ani which no doubt was just as well for us . At 3pm the Destroy Radient ( F56 ) left us and steam away at full speed . We are now well out of the German mine area , so have no fear of accid from that quarter . Decemb Decemb the 26th ( Box Day ) This morn we are all veri much excit and in an aw hurri to reach England . The day is veri cold and windi but we are all pack on deck watch for the first glimps of England . At about 3pm we sight the Lighthous at the entranc to the Humber River . When we were about half a mile from the entranc we stop until the Pilot came aboard , Then proceed up the river a distanc of about 4 mile and anchor . The vessel that were lie at anchor insid the Head and the factori and Railway train , made an aw din blow their whistl and Siren as we enter harbour . We were all taken off the troopship in small tender and land at the Quay . The tide was too low to allow the larg warship to go right up to the wharf . On arriv at the Quay we were given a veri warm recept by the Decemb 1918 Red-Cross ladi , We were suppli with all sort of eatabl and had some veri nice tea serv . After we had finish eat our fill we were put in the train with a carriag between six men , And left for Ripon Camp in Yorkshir short afterward , arriv there earli the follow morn . I stay at Ripon Camp for two day , was rig out in anoth clean uniform and had all particular taken again , I was also requir to make a statement concern the attack of the morn of April the 11th 1919 . On the 30th of Decemb I was grant one month ?s leav and came to London in the afternoon , After go to the Australian Headquart in Horseferri Road Westminst And mess about there run after cloth and Leav pass for about an hour , I was allow to go free . I stay at the Star- Januari 1919 and-Gart Hotel at Putney on the night of the 30th . I continu to stop in London till the 3rd of Januari look at the various place of interest and have a good time general . Somehow I rather think I deserv a good holiday after my twenti month of Prisonership . On the even of the 3rd of Januari I left London for Scotland . I arriv at Edinburgh at about 8am on the morn of the fourth . dure the morn I visit the Castl , It stand on a veri high rock and command all the citi , It can be seen form almost ani part of the countri for a mile or two away . The differ build insid the castl wall were interest , The King Queen chamber , Dine Hall , castl chappel , Dungeon , and other place , The crown Jewel were beauti , The keeper explain what the various sign were and also gave us their histori . The Dine and banquet hall is a veri larg room , It was use a littl while ago as Januari garrison dispensari , But late has been restor and convert into an Armori of Ancient Scottish wepon and armour . The window are of stain glass and bear the arm of the old scottish lord . The Chappel which is call St Margaret Chappel , is suppos to be the oldest build in Scotland which has a roof over it . It was erect by Queen Margaret who die in the year 1095 . In the front of the Chappel and face toward the citi is the big gun , which is term Mon ? Meg . Later in the day I visit the Forth-Bridg . I took the motor bus to Queensferri , where the bridg can be seen the best , It was too cold and windi so I did not attempt to go across it . The fourth bridg is the largest and best bridg of it kind in the world . It carri the North-British Railway line across the Queensferri narrow . Its length is a littl over one and a half mile , fulli two third of the distanc is over salt water . The central arch of which Januari there are three , are each almost one third of a mile in span , and the pier rise to a height of 361 feet abov high water mark . The bridg took seven year to construct and was open by the present king in the year 1890 , Its cost was three and a half million sterl . After I return from view the Fourth Bridg I visit Calton hill and saw the big Prison , Royal high school build , Nelson Monument , The Burn Monument , and the Nation monument . The Nelson Monument is in the form of a tower , which stand on the summit of Calton Hill . From the top a beauti view of the countri can be obtain . It has also time ball arrang on the top which fall at 1pm everi day , and by which all clock throughout the citi are regul . The Natiolon monument is the foundat stone of what was design to be a ?Nation monument on memori of Scotsmen who fell in the battl , by sea and land , in the war with Franc , It was laid by Georg the fourth in the year 1822 Januari All that remain of it is twelv tall column which when seen from a distanc seem to be the ruin of a veri beauti build , But when view close it look as if it had been start onli a few year ago . Another histor monument is the ?Scott Monument which is situat in Princess Street near the Princess Street Railway Station , It is a beauti structur and was erect in 1840-44 at a cost of 16,000 . In the centr of the structur under a canopi is a statu of Scott , and figur from the waver novel occupi the various nich around the monument . After wander around the town for a few hour after this , I took train to Dunde and arriv there at about 10pm , I stay at the Oversea club for soldier and sailor . The trip from Edinburgh to Dunde was , with the except of the view of the Grand fleet as we cross over the fourth-bridg much the same as the ride from London to Edinburgh , In fact all railway journey are much the same , They all get monoton Januari after the first hour or two . I stay in Dunde until the 8th of Januari when I got the 8am train for Glasgow , I stop in Glasgow for one day then took train to Edinburgh stop there for about 6 hour and then return to Dunde late at night on the 9th On the 12th I again went to Glasgow and call on a friend who was prison in Germani with me , I stay there till the even of the 13th when I took the express back to London arriv at about 8am on the morn of the 14th The Citi of Glasgow is veri much like Sydney , it is veri busi as sea port general are , I did not like the place so did not stay there long . There is not much of interest to the travel either . The tramway system is veri good , but it doe not come up to Sydney , The cheap of travel is mile ahead of Sydney . The distanc one can travel on the Glasgow tram for one halfpenni , we have to pay three halfpenc for in Sydney . The Citi of Edinburgh is a veri Januari clean citi , It is just the place where I would like to live if it was necessari that I should live over this side of the world , The onli drawback to the place is the old fashion cable-tram , The cabl which is alway revolv underground is veri annoy when it need greas . The object that the Edinburgh peopl have to the ordinari electr tram , is that the Pole that would have to be erect to carri the overhead wire would be a disfigur to the citi . The street of the citi over here look much wider than they realli are , the reason be that the shop and busi place have no awn over the footpath and consequ no post . Whi there are no awn over the footpath like Australian citi , is becaus of the heavi snow fall , If there were awn and the snow was to fall heavi and bank up on the roof , it would be a sourc of great danger to the public general , If it were to fall of in drift peopl walk along and person drive on the road would never know the moment that a drift would occur and fall on them , And buri them , or startl the hors , as the case may be . The citi of Dunde I like best of all to spend my holiday in , It was a nice quiet littl place , The peopl were veri sociabl and everyth general seem to suit me , It cannot boast of ani place of interest except the Tay bridg over the Firth of Tay . The Tay bridg is recognis as be the best and bridg of it kind , It is not a patch on the fourth bridg as far as engin is concern , but I think it is much longer . The height abov sea level is not more than 60 feet in ani place . I continu to stay in London till the 20th of Januari . While in London I stay at Putney which is a suburb just outsid the citi proper , although the postal address is London S.W.7. Putney is a veri nice suburb , and is situat on the Thame River the part of the Thame river that run past Putney is where the big boat race are Januari held , and the Henley regatta is held not far away . I left London by the 1.30pm train on the 20th of Januari and arriv at Mansfield station about 3 hour later . Cousin Frank and Tom came to the station to meet me . I stay at Pleasley with Uncle Aunti until the end of my leav which finish on the end of the month , Dure my stay there I went to Ilkeston to see Uncle Walter and famili . I also went to Nottingham to see Cousin Ethel , and on one day I went togeth with Uncle Aunti and two or three other to Ripley to see the birthplac of Dad . Everyth connect with Dad earli day in England was shown and explain to me by Uncle , While at Ripley I visit Mr Robert Walker an old friend of Dad ?s . I went to Newhoften to see old Mrs White who write veri regular Januari Februari 1919 to Alma and was at one time Grandfath housekeep . She was veri pleas to see me , She was veri bad with Dropsi when I saw her . Dure my stay at Uncle John ?s Uncle Fred came out from Birmingham to see me . On the night of the 29th I went to London again . I left Pleasley vale with the intent of visit Etta ?s peopl at Read but on arriv in London I found that I had no time owe to my have overlook the hour of the expir of my pass . I report to headquart and was sent to camp at Sutton Veni near Warminst in Wiltshir . I caught the train at Paddington Station and arriv at Camp at about 4.30pm on the 30th . Today Tuesday Februari the 4th I went to the town of Warminst and had a good look around the place , I am expect to leav here in a week or two enrout for home . I am Februari attach to the roll of the Steamship ?Euriped which is to leav for Australia on or about the 20th of this month . If all goe well I should be home by Easter . Here in Camp the rule and routin is not near as strict as it was when the war was on . I have no drill to do , I occupi myself by do odd job around the camp . Sinc my arriv at camp I have been in constant receipt of letter , both from here and Australia . 17-2-19 The weather for the past two week has been veri cold with one or two veri wet day . I am at present at No 5 Camp at Sutton-Veni about three mile from the town of Warminst . 18-2-19 yesterday we had as much as 30 degre of Frost accord to the paper , Today it is rain and is still Februari 1919 veri cold . The Influenza is go about a lot again , The men are die veri fast from it in the camp . Around the camp there is a lot of Sandbag be done , Onli the other night one man was knock down and kill and rob , while he was walk home from Warminst to the Camp . It is not safe to be out of camp alon after dark . Two men were caught red hand the other night . These last two day I have had a cold on the head and chest , If the wether doe not get warmer I do not know how I am to get rid of it . 19th of March 1919On Tuesday the 18th of Februari I was taken veri ill just after I had finish dinner , I turn into bed straight away , But as the afternoon wore on I got wors , so I decid to send for the Doctor , Februari The Doctor was sent for and he sent an Army-Medical-Corps-Corpor down to see me and take my temperatur , which he did , My temperatur was 103.4 degre . Soon after he went away , I had a violent fit of vomit which made me veri weak and much wors , It also made my head ach veri bad . I continu to stay in bed and wrap myself up to keep me as warm as possibl and prevent myself from shiver so much , but it was no use , The warmer I got the more I seem to shiver . As near as I can recollect it was about 5.30 pm when the Ambulanc came to the hut for me . I was taken first to the ?Group Hospit at Sutton-Veni , But they would not admit me , own to my temperatur be too high . I was kept wait in the Ambulanc for about 10 minut , when the
