 7 April We went for a walk around the town & saw the Bastille Monument.  This was erected after the second revolution on the spot where the Bastille used to be.  The Monument in the Place de la Republique showed scars where a Hunnish bomb had dropped & splattered it.  The iron lamp standards nearby were similarly marked.  At night  we went to the Gaumont Picture Palace at Place Clichy.  It is supposed to be the largest in the world, & holds 20,000 people.  We got special concession tickets, being soldiers.  The main boulevards are always full of traffic.  They are wide with wide footpaths lined with trees.  It is just as well that they are wide, for the traffic is go as you please.  Taxis dart here & there speeding up
