<p>Got this song from a friend</p>
<p>Till the sands of the desert grow cold<br/>Till the infinite numbers are told<br/>God gave thou to me and mine thou shalt be<br/>For ever, to have and to hold.<br/>Till the story of judgement is told<br/>Till the mystery of heaven unfold<br/>I'll turn <strike>unto</strike> love to thee my shrine thou shalt be<br/>Till the sands of the desert grow cold</p>
<p>The hot winds that come to thee<br/>Oer desert sands all blow from thee<br/>I bid them to tell thee that I love thee<br/>Speeding my soul to thee<br/>Hot sands burning, fire my veins with passion bold<br/>Love I love thee, till desert sands grow cold<br/>Love me! I'll love thee</p>
<p>The desert a burning sea<br/>A barrier stands 'tween thee and me<br/><strike>All</strike> The love fast as light hasten to thee<br/>Quenching my thirst in the Noon suns finds me, far beyond the caravan<br/>Death there warns me how vain is the strength of man<br/>Love me! I'll love thee.</p>
