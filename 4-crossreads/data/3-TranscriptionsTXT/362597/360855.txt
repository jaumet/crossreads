Friday 7/1/16 (16)It is still raining & we cannot go up on deck to sleep. We were granted permission to go up on deck to sleep this morning. We were issued with covers for our mattresses but I don't bother with the mattress. I just take my 2 Blankets & pillow.
We had a lecture in the afternoon from Capt Wylie all about "germs". My word we will learn a lot before we have finished this job.
I had to sleep on three forms side by side & I had a real good night's rest.
