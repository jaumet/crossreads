<p>I remember several occasions when our chaps got a belting.  One was:  We were forking stones between the sleepers when our "boatswain" Perryman stopped and sang us a little song entitled "The Death of Nelson".

One Sunday we heard a shot and went out side and found that somebody had shot a big cat.  We jumped on this, cooked and ate it, and in the state we were in, enjoyed it.  About a week later we caught another cat, and</p>
