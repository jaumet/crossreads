<p>November, 1915<br/>Monday 22<br/>A Dentist works at the Field Ambulance, not far away &amp; even a set of False Teeth can be made &ndash;<br/><strike>Some of the men have been collecting the plates out of the skulls on the Beach as Souvenirs &ndash; Ghouls -</strike><br/>Again all ranks have been warned about communicating any War News in their letters. I try to avoid the subject but beyond what we eat how we live &amp; the quantity of vermin there is really little else. I have just made a Cook house out of Stones from the Beach, covered with Clay &amp; roofed with part of a Sail from the wreckage this is for the men in the Mess.</p>
