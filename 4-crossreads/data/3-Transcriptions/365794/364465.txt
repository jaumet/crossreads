<p>Monday 4th March 1917 [1918]<br/>A sad day.  Sister Lee from G.H. has become neutral &amp; is signed up as "may become dangerous" so one more young life is maybe ruined by the war.<br/>Now one realizes what was peculiar in her manner &amp; the funny abrupt little ways she had.<br/>"Citidal" hosp. refuses to take her so she has 3 nurses doing 8 hrs. each.  Melancholia is the trouble with religion.  Was persuaded to see her but the result terrifying to me &amp; a sleepless night followed.<br/>At 11 a.m. D. of Connaught inspected the hosp., presented medals &amp; expressed satisfaction etc.  Called Mrs. Beasley 6.7 p.m.  Bridge is coming to me by the friendly aid of my boys in the ward.</p>
