<p>27 December 1914<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>Reveille at 6</p>
<p>Stables as per usual but no riding for church parade takes its place.  Defaulters have to do all cleaning round camp the men have another medical inspection &amp; one is bad &amp; is being treated locally then after dinner men go for ride.  Bert M &amp; Larkin go to Mena on bikes along with Toby.  Write home &amp; again to Nell no mail is in sight yet.  In our Xmas doily I got all the signatures of the men in the troop &amp; sent it to Nell.  Had a visitor to tea an old 21st man named Bruce he's now with the A.M.C. from Queensland Lieut from HQ came over &amp; passed his opinion on the bikes  again, the "Big H" came in for some hard criticizing, Masters proves very annoying for he is over jubilant at his successful ride &amp; now considers himself a "[indecipherable] cyclist".  Bed at 9. As day as been rather lazy.</p>
<p>28 December 1914<br/>Monday 10 weeks from home</p>
<p>Reveille at 6.</p>
<p>Stables under Sgt Masters &amp; then at the school the boss gives me "Beauty" who proves a lovely hack &amp; if ever we get home I would like to have her, for the second ride I have Goty's which is just the opposite &amp; I rip the side out of it with spurs after dinner Toby &amp; I went into Cairo to find how many motors are available, 3 Indians 1 Rudge a BSA &amp; a Douglas so it looks that we must have an Indian [indecipherable] scrap partially seized today &amp; mine is the same Toby's is just the same, get all the work.  Women are numerous today whatever is up for since we left Australia it is the largest number that I have seen.  Mail left today for Australia but again none for us get awfully homesick for the first time the cause of it was AF.  I wonder if it is likewise with her.  Bed at 9.30 after [indecipherable] off defaulters.</p>
