 My dear Jack & Clare, Got an undated letter from you today but should think it was posted in September. 
 My word old horse you sound cheerful but you are not having the best of time. However I hope the furnaces are now going O.K. again & things are straightening. I am sending you along a fiver for Xmas & hope it arrives safely to give you & the kids a day out in commemoration. 
 Dear old Clare I hope she is doing well. I had made full arrangements to call on Mrs Dye but the Turks came & I did not see. I think she has now gone to India but will find out for certain soon as we are now in a camp having arrived here yesterday evening. Its great to be in a tent again & tomorrow I hope to have the luxury of sleeping in a bed even if it is only made of feed-bags. You can guess it will go alright after not having seen one for three months. 
 Tell Clare she needn't growl about her luck. We suffer here with too little bed. Glad the kidlets are doing so well. Yes I would like a snap of them very much. Sorry Barrett is wounded & hope its nothing very serious. I had heard about Annie Gainer. Its bad luck but it looks almost like a judgment. 
 Give my love to Ede & Al & the other tribes. You didn't mention Al or Ted. Hope they are going alright. Am sending Al along a couple of quidlets for Xmas.
