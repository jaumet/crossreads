 JULY   THURSDAY 13   1916 
 Cold & dull all day. The headquarters staff all went out to Stonehenge for a walk. It is marvellous how the people who built it in days gone bye got the stones there & put them up. It would be a fair job now with all our cranes ect. Had some more practise with flags in afternoon. Bill Hunter, Self Warren, Bill Nesbitt, & Tom Reed got a car & went into Salisbury for tea. We had dinner at the "Cathedral Hotel" and had a look round the town & cathedral, but the Cathedral was closed & we could only see the outside
