<p>457<br/>Stephanie Barton &ndash; I haven't seen her since she was in short frocks and socks &ndash; awfully glad to hear Billy is so fit &ndash; its rotten luck for him about his business but this war can't go on for ever and there may be a good time coming &ndash; I hadn't heard about Mrs Boyces death, it takes me back to the Glebe Point days when I think of her &ndash; I heard a rumour that Betina's hospital was going to be moved from Lemnos to Sicily, but don't know if there is any truth in it &ndash;<br/>My fondest love to you all, hoping you all merry and bright<br/>Your Affectionate son<br/>Gibson</p>
