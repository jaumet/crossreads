1.7:17Dear Dad,Just a post card to let you know that we are both faring well. It has been a perfect day today just like one of our perfect winter days. It was very rainy two days last week & all the creeks & rivers are running a banker. I believe that two mail boats went down with all our mail on Board. I had a Photo taken in the Strand, London. Let me know whether you receive one or if Bess gets one. We still keep busy over here but we are pretty old heads now & work does not trouble us. We have 2 afternoons off in the week & I have had a real picnic in Salisbury each day whether rain, hail or shine. We had  two letters last week fro, you  dated 22.4.17 but we have answered those of the 29.4.17. Now, I must go off to bed as it is nearly 10 pm & I like my old bed as much as ever. Remember me to my old Travelling Companions especially old Otto & to the Neighbours. I also send Remembrances. Dave , Ellis & I are doing fine & although England is starving, we are not 'cos we had peas & cabbage for our dinner today. Love from Harry
