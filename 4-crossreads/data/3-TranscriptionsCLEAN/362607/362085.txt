 Dear George, This is a view of the Palace  in which uncle has an Interest. Over 2000 People can dance at one time & there is seating accommodation for a concert for 15000 souls. I have not been inside. I have been spending my time walking & cycling with Marie & Auntie.  It has been lovely weather for March which is generally one of very bad months but it is always 10% milder in the Island than any place on the mainland. I am just waiting for Auntie to finish cooking so that I can lay the Table. Marie is flitting about like a Fairy from room to room overhead. You would like Marie. She is the loveliest Girl in the world. If she was not my Cousin I am afraid I should fall in love with her. Auntie is a chip too. Mumma & Her would be good mates. They would spin yarns like two terribly old sea salts.
