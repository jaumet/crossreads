29th Beautiful day. Out of trenches. Very quiet all day. Fritz bombards during the night.
30th Misty. Trip to Dickebusch with troops. During the day our guns kept up a hail of shells on to the German trenches. Machine guns are also going same.
October 1st Fine day though cool. Battalion have a day off. Very quiet along the line except for the usual rattle of machine guns.
Oct 2nd Raining. Stayed "at home" and entertained some of the lads with a gift Gramophone, which we borrowed from the Quartermaster. It certainly reminded one of old times to hear the familiar music. It was dead quiet all along the line and a stranger would hardly think a war was on.
Oct 14th Up to now everything has been very quiet. Every day I have gone to trenches with troops but apart from that I have done nothing. Every day it becomes colder, and very often it rains.
