<p>rain nor snow. A little frost   &amp;  a little sunshine. Fritz has made two or three attempts but not succeeded in doing much damage. Everybody expected him last night but he did not visit us.</p>
<p>I hope to leave about the end of next month. May take (2) two months to get out. Travel very slowly   &amp;  around Africa, I think.</p>
<p>hope Norman is having a good time   &amp;  is getting better. It looks as if Conscription will be turned down again. Isn't it dreadful. Of course it is a difficult question   &amp;  should have been at the first.</p>
<p>I went to H.C. yesterday morn   &amp;   it was a very sacred service. Shall tell you all about it another time. Poor one legged patients   &amp;  only one sister (yours truly). Hope you all had a jolly Xmas. Heaps of love   &amp;  kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
