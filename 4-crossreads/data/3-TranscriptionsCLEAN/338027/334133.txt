Contreceive our mail from home a fortnights.  I got a few letters but it is the next mail I am looking for.  Sammy gave me a terribly rough ride he has cultivated every vice imaginable, he rears, bites, kicks and bucks, and reefs your arms out the more I fought him the worse he got, if he does not improve I am going to get rid of him.
ThursdayExercising horses all day by riding then we rode over to the pumping station & had a look over it.  It was a magnificent sight the engines are the largest I have yet seen, then we went through a beautiful palm glade called Kafr-el-Tamon
Friday, 12 February, 1915In the morning we went out with the brigade, sham fighting, but we did nothing, only looked on at the attack from a secluded view.  I rode Mary & Henry to-day, am giving Sammy a spell.
The artillery shooting of the N.Zealanders is magnificent altogether the 1st Brigade is doing fine work.
Issued with tunics and underclothing, caps to arrive shortly.
Our reinforcements arrived to-day horses in a day or so.  I know one of them they seem a decent lot of chaps.
Went to Heliopolis at night and had a look round.
