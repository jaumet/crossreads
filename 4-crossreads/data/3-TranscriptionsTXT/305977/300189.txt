firing positions.  The Dorrigo identities in this camp had a meeting after tea & a good old yarn.
Wednesday 17th  [Mar]Turned out in full dress (marching order) & got a good start on at 8.30am, passed through Tura & reached Halouan at 10 oclock about 10 miles from here.  We watered & fed our horses not forgetting ourselves & started on the road back, reaching camp at 5.30pm.  We were all pretty tired & stiff.  We appreciated the hot stew the cooks had ready for us.
Thursday 18thWe carried out further manoeuvres attacking, retiring under cover, & put in fairly good work.  Fire discipline drill in the afternoon.  We were turned out of our big tent & put into a smaller on the other side of the horse lines, the larger tents being required for Red Cross purposes.  Was on picket at night.  Drew middle shift.
