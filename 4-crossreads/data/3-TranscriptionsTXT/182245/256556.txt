 FEBRUARY 1917 
 10 SATURDAY 
 Fine &amp; Sunny, &amp; fairly warm, in 
 comparison to the weather we 
 have been having. We had 
 the usual Saturday full dress 
 inspection &amp; everything was A1. 
 Cleaning harness ect in morning 
 &amp; I drove the officers cart up to 
 Armenti&egrave;res in afternoon with 
 Cyril [Rohu?] for stores ect. 
 The battery went up with amunition 
 at night, but I did not go. 
 There was a fair bombardment 
 going on all day &amp; they livened 
 up at night.
