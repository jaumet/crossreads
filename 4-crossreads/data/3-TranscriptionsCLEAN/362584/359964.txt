11.
return one. Conway Duffy & Donaldson turned up just as we were moving off. We had dined out & they had returned to the hotel for the luggage while I hurried to the station. Lord knows how we caught that train, but we just managed it.
Let us pass over the march from Swindon to camp. Suffice it to say that we arrived at 2.15 next morning with the broken remnants of a company. Sleep came quite naturally to us all.
I think I have received all your letters. Those photographs on the launch were quite good. Everybody was immensely surprised to learn that we might have been pulled off the boat at any minute.
The spring bayonet saw any amount of work on the boat, & the men became very keen. Some of them did very well.
Give my love to father Dorothy & Catherine.
Your affectionate Son
Keith
P.S. Dearest Mater. Have just read this letter
