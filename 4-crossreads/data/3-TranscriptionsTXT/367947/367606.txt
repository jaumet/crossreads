 3rd September 1916 
 My dear old Jack &amp; Clare Just a short note to let you know I'm still going strong &amp; feeling hale &amp; hearty. 
 You will have read in the papers during the past few weeks of us having been in a bit of a go &amp; making some captures, well we are still a long way away from any fixed camp or convenience &amp; will probably be in this state for another month. The fighting seems to have settled right out &amp; no Turks about worth speaking of. 
 We are camped out near to where we had our last fight as our horses couldn't have gone much further at the pace we had to work. My word it is the first big Light Horse work of the war and it has been most interesting throughout. I only wish we have more stunts like it. Our casualties were not very great &amp; its surprising in open country how much lead it takes to pot a man. 
 You would like to see the date oases. Just now all the dates are ripe &amp; there are tons &amp; tons everywhere. The country here is soft drift sand for miles &amp; miles &amp; then in the hollows one drops on a clump of palms (4 or 5 acres as a rule). Can get water almost any where at a depth of 2 ft and although brackish quite good &amp; drinkable so you see desert work is not so arduous as the story books make out. Of course there are plenty of drawbacks, but what are we here for?
