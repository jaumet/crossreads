<p>[Sunday 1 October 1916]</p>
<p>Arrived Fleetwood 5 AM but as the Daylight Saving Bill puts all Time back one hour it is really 4 AM Irish time <strike>but</strike> to be different but from today all will be the same in the United Kingdom  I take train to Blackpool &amp; change there for St Annes-on-Sea.<br/>Much talk of recent raids but a man's luck would be out if he got a BOMB in this country.<br/>Found Laura at the Grand &amp; had a long yarn, &amp; introduced her to the Isherwood family.  She gave Dolly some nice Fish Knives &amp; has helped me a lot, poor old Laura I'll write again re her later</p>
