Up 7.30 am had a good tasty stew for breakfast. Wrote to Base Post Office, Uncle Fred home. XX After dinner walked into Weymouth, about 2 miles walk. Went down the 2 main streets, saw some naval motor launches - I think they were for mine-laying - at the end of the street in the river. Bought picture p/cards of the place also sent a book of views to Mother. Also went on to the pier saw the Channel Islands steamer. Had some tea at the Australian YMCA then left for the camp before it got too dark, arriving back at 6 pm. On the way back passed Capt Barton from our C.C.S. but did not speak to him. When in Weymouth this afternoon saw chap named Clark who was our company orderly room corporal in 35th Btn. He is now a Lieut. Very heavy gale last night this morning.

Wind has now completely dropped. Sent p/cards of Weymouth to Australia to Ida. After dinner walked about 2 miles along road to Abbotsbury Bridport, passing through village of Chickerell. Also had plenty of Blackberries. Had fine view of the coast from one of the hills. Saw a "Blimp? airship flying along the coast. Was a beautiful afternoon of sunshine. Passed Capt D Barton again today but had no chance of speaking to him.
