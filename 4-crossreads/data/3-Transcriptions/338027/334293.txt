<p>Tuesday, 29th December, 1914<br/>Orderly room call went at 8.45 a.m. &amp; we were paraded before the colonels tent, the corp was charged first &amp; after hearing his evidence he was remanded for courtmartial.  We all got severely reprimanded by the C.O. and got seven days C.B.  my first default since I enlisted.</p>
<p>I let my pony be ridden by an N.C.O. to-day, who is a bit rough on horses but I wanted the freshness taken out of him &amp; I am not allowed to do it.  Every half hour after Retreat the trumpet sounds Default &amp; we have to run like Hell on to the parade ground to be dismissed this continues until lights out.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 30th December, 1914<br/>Court martial continued this morning we all gave evidence on oath finally he was severely reprimanded, we all thought that he would lose his stripes.</p>
<p>Pay day but still I draw nothing having not yet worked off my debt I had my pay book altered so will be all right next day.  At night wrote to George.  On day stables all day with the other 3 defaulters.</p>
<p>Lately the corp has not been working very smoothly, the officers of both sections have been quarreling &amp; the men are very dissatisfied.</p>
