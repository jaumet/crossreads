<p>Albert &amp; Amiens<br/>2/3/17<br/>25 mile ride to Amiens.  Passed through Albert ruined and desolate but full of sleeping troops thickly packed for all the dark silent empty streets.  Hit the main road and plugged along quietly in the moonlight.  Horses went well and at 2.30 am we pulled up near Gare du Nord Amiens.  Feeling sore and chaffed.  Sent Flower back with the horses and then knocked<br/>3/3/17  up the Hotel Belfort on the corner and was soon fast asleep.  They could not give me any coffee or supper owing to food restrictions.  Arranged to be called at 5 am and turned into white sheets and soft bed for a couple of hours.  Called on time and found breakfast was contrary to [indecipherable] also so cleared over to the station.  Got necessary papers and had great luck in striking the 1.30 Paris train which had been delayed.  An English tommy bumped me in and bought a paper.  Travelling companions in this carriage are 3 French officers &amp; 2 civilians, the former smart in their blue uniforms and caps gold braided. [indecipherable] is one of them.  A quiet journey.  Condensation of breath on windows prevents looking out.  At Chantilly we had an influx of additional passengers &ndash; a little widow among them.</p>
