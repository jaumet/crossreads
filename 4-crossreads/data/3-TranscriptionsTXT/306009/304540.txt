1915Dec. 24 Fri.Christmas Eve - Spent the afternoon decorating the Colonel's office - it looks very smart!Went into Cairo about 5.30 p.m. & about half an hour later rain began to fall - third time since I came to Cairo. Went to Shepheards' where a Belgian Fete was being held, but arrived too late & found all over Town full of Troops (notwithstanding rain) & some the worse for booze. Rendered first aid to an unconscious chap who had evidently been drugged with native liquor & then handed him over to the Mil. Police.Went back to Gezira acting as escort to English lady who appeared to be a trifle afraid of natives & "excited" soldiers.
