September 1915
Monday 6
Plenty of patients in the morning & 3 operations which delayed matters somewhat.
Off at dinner time & slept during afternoon.
Short walk in evening & bed early.- feeling very tired - fault of climate.  This seems to be a rather a muggy month for even after a shower in morning I feel upside down.
False alarm in evening that we were going on Wed.  Wrote a long letter to Rita & a note to Professor [indecipherable].
More yarns about the front.  The general opinion is that it is a perfect hell & a good place to keep away from.
