<p>Gallipoli<br/>30th Nov 15<br/>My darling Tic<br/>In my last I mentioned that we were about to move so we did and oh what a time we have had since Rain, wind &amp; snow I never felt it so cold in any part I have been as it has been the last week We have heard our last mail was lost so it is making it feel twice as long and believe our outwards one from here also went down so that if we don't get any parcels for Xmas we will know what has become of them. I got your, Amy!s, Dome, Roy &amp; Linda. Yours so relieved me to know that you still were the brave little woman I left and look at things that were to be. My hardest task was getting all your letters for him and myself &amp; know that you did not know. I have told you in former letters what you ask about Bas so that I will keep all till I get back.<br/>Wall must have gone to England or I should have heard from him since, it will be lovely if he turned up in NSW Lampshire has not returned yet from Malta(?) the last I got from him he was about again. Anyone that tries to get back here now wants their head read. Tell my darling Linda I wrote her a letter to her self also Dot &amp; Roy My next will be to Amy I cannot find much time in the day &amp; no lights are allowed at night so it may be a day or two. Tom Burton hunted me up when he came over his Bat. went into the place we left he and his brother they both looked well. Now my darling</p>
