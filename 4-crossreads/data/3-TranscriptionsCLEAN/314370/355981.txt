  
 February, 1916 Sunday 13 Write letter home in the forenoon.  It is so long since I have heard from mum that I find it hard to put anything into letters. After dinner take dad to the Zoo, & see the new wonders of a hippo & several splendid Giraffes. Have dinner in Cairo & return at 8.30 pm 
 Monday 14 Peg away at the care & cleaning subject; the men a very keen to learn. Have great hopes for them.
