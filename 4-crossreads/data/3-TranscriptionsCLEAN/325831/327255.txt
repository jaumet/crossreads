 Dear father, 
 being born under a lucky star, I am on leave with the general, so the next ten days will be rather crowded, which is only another way of saying that this letter is going to be short. 
 Gen'l Holmes is the best gamset & most efficient officer in the British forces. 'Quae cum ita sint' [that being the case] I am the luckiest A.D.C. in the army.
