<p>deafening. Some of the Australian boys who have been here a long time their nerves are completely gone. cant keep still. Others are going about the trenches stupefied with the constant thunder of fire in their ears for months.  Next day Mon 9th Tues 10th Wed 11th was very quiet we have been observing only at night time and resting in the day time though in the trenches all the time.  It is pretty safe in the trenches from bullets but when there is a heavy shell fire it is dangerous and the shrapnel bursts in them sometimes and causes many casualties our own shells which are fired from behind us drop short sometimes and blow our trenches up on the morning of Sat 7th Aug one came over and burst right in our trench and blew 8 of chaps almost to pieces some had head and arms off we have not been out of trenches or had a wash either have not took our clothes off and have been here a week things have been quiet lately up till the evening of Sat 14th Aug about 6 oclock</p>
