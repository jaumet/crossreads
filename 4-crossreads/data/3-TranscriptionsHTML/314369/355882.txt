<p>31 August 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>The difference in treatment here from our previous knocking about is marvellous.<br/>The sisters cant do enough for you anything you want you have only to ask for it.<br/>The tucker too for dinner we had roast chicken &amp;  Baked spuds   &amp;  Custard w/- a big cup of lemonade.<br/>Our wounds are dressed twice a day<br/>They injected some juice into me to stop any infection from the foot</p>
<p>1915 September 1<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>Everything very quiet.<br/>Write a letter home but cannot get it posted yet.<br/>My throat gets very sore towards evening   &amp;  I get something from the sister which fixes it up by morning</p>
