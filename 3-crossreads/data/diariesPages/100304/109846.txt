bay where my headquarters were when the bombardment increased to intense and they got right on to our parapet shelling the breaches particularly. The fellows crouched on their haunches right down low. The next thing was a still further shortening to just a few feet in front of the parapet and the shells struck with such force that they burrowed underground and burst in the trench. My steel helmet saved me from a nasty scalp wound. Just about 3.00 I was sitting on the fire step with one leg up in front supporting a note book while writing a message when a shell came right through and burst. All I know is that I felt a tremendous weight fall on my left leg above the knee and my breeches were covered with blood which at first I thought was someone elses. The air was full of groans and cries of ?Hell! God! Jesus Damn" etc ?My arm, My leg, Oh the pain" etc etc. Poor Newton who was next to me lay a mangled dead mass on the floor. was writhing terribly injured but still alive Adair's leg and arm were blown about causing him dreadful agony.
