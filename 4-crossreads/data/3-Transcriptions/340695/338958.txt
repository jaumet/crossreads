<p>Saw Tom Riordan but Eric Forbes was away. It was great seeing all the old faces again. We had a great yarn.</p>
<p>23-11/16 8 pm.  Phone message just received saying that Eric Clarke was evacuated with wound in head &amp; shell shock. Geo Veitch floated in here to-night suffering also from shell shock. They did a good bit of damage by all accounts up at the Supply Dump at Montanban.<br/>24-11/16. Sitting round the fire in Rue Peronne Albert. Shells of fairly large calibre are screaming &amp; screeching over head &amp; lobbing about 100 yards away making a terrible din. One wonders where the next will drop.</p>
