20 - E deMfor Australia. She looked really lovely such a sweet good face and very much like Mother, so different from what I expected. I thought she would look old plain & bad tempered & all sorts of funny things, but instead there was a little angel if ever there was one on earth. I grew to love her very much indeed. Of course I told Aunt Florence about Mother, Una and the family etc and told them about mother adopting Doreen & Uncle Harry laughed  & passed  a remark about it being in the family. I did not understand what he meant, but I did later. A neice of Uncle Harry's stayed with them sometimes & was there during my stay. She was born at Chatswood Sydney about 22 years ago but both parents are dead she is rather a nice girl & she & I got on very well together, but unfortunately took ill some few days before I left which put an end to our promenades. She having an income of her own makes her somewhat inclined to be self willed. Se went in for gardening as a means of augmenting her income. I laughed when she told me about it in all seriousness,
