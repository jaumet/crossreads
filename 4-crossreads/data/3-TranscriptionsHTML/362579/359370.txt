<p>in Blighty for next winter. Dorothy is well but rather fed-up like the rest sof us. She   &amp;  Annie Bell have not gone for leave yet, so may be able to get ourselves together.</p>
<p>Wonder if Edmund has arrived safely   &amp;  been to see  you. Hope he has more happiness now   &amp;  that things will work all right for him.</p>
<p>Hope you are all very well   &amp;  happy &ndash; Go out as much as you can to visit friends.</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
