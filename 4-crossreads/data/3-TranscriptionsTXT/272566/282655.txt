 To Dickebush To 5th Mobile Vet Section To Dickebush and all the batteries of the 7th Aust. Artillery Brigade To A.D.M.S. Dickebush The third run as above was undertaken with the object of finding out the owner of a horse which we had to shoot yesterday and drag inside our front gate.  Now we want the other party to come and bury it.  I managed to find the owners after a bit of Sherlock  Holmes  strategy Met Metcalfe from the "Royal".
