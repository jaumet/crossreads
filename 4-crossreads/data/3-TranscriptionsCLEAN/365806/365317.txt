  
 H.G. 3rd Australian Division 13.X1.16 Dear Judge, 
 [note in margin] You are not very complimentary when you say that you hoped that I wd be taken away from the job of handling men & put to something else.  And I thought that I was not doing too badly!  Luckily I had'nt enough time to damage the efficiency of the cyclists. 
 Dear Judge, 
 Your welcome letter arrived this morning, and by a coincidence J.P. Sheridan was kind enough to come all the way from London to spend three hours with me, so the atmosphere was quite homelike. 
 I quite understand your feelings about the military decorations which Captain Ferguson would have received if he had lived.  The rule with regard to these is altered
