First impressions of camp good - given good tea & temporary shakedown in hut.
Wednesday   Following morning were allocated work in Hut 83 - a ward - after medical inspection etc. etc.I, of course, explained for what I was sent down, & Sgt. said I should in due course be sent into dispensary.Subsequently found out that Cpl dispenser was to be drafted with permanently unfits for Australia on Sunday & I was to take his place(Positively refuse to conjecture on whether I shall get promotion
