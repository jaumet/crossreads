14/10/17 SteenvordeA busy day submitting honors and rewards for our recent actions. Matthews took summaries for F.G.C.M'S. During the morning General Paton was round to look at the men and billets and just before lunch Major General Smythe came and stayed for a while. Heard of Reggie being missing. The country round here is green and pleasant but now is starting to become bleak and wintry in appearance. The men are all housed in barns and outbuildings. The padre conducted church parade at 9.30 and was a busy person for the remainder of the day rushing here and there holding services. Hope to be off to Paris in a few days time and got Bunning and Davis to apply for their English leave. Rodda also could do with a little change to Paris I think. Will get busy on the morrow starting our specialists off again - sigs, gunners etc. have all to be trained.
