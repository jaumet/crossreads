somebody blundering around for souvenirs must have fell over it.
Saturday 31-3-17left the works today for Bapaume on the way we passed 10 Tanks and 5 aeroplanes which had come to grief.  The Tanks were all alongside the road & generally upside down.  Bapaune is a terrible wreck.  The damage was nearly all done by mines not by our shells.   the country is undulating & grassy & very few shell holes are visible.  A Taube brought down one of our  Baloons today.  The occupants of the car escaped in a parachute.
