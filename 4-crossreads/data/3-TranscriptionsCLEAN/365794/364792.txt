Saturday 12th '18 [October]Off duty 2-5.  "Floo" has me in its grip & I am only struggling on to try to dodge the Sick room if possible.  Pts. are very ill with it & sisters going down daily - 56 pts., 2 sisters & 1 orderly in this stuffy ward & with another heat spasm when it seemed almost gone, is proving too much for us in D. i.  One pt. "Welsh Band" boy died suddenly 4 a.m. with pleurisy & heart.Ward very heavy.
Sunday, 13thMatron presented me with a "day off" so I lie & suffer by myself all day.  T. 101.6, head splitting, breakfast brought but V.A.D. omits to report me to Home sister so I lie until 4 p.m. then get cup tea, then alas! 9 p.m. transferred to "Sick Sisters", 4 women already there!!!
