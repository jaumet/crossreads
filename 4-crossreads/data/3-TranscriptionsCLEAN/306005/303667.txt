  
 24-12-16 bombs on the beach & along the hills to the West of El Arish wounding two Tommies; I forgot to mention yesterday that we never saw a Taube all day our 'planes came out & 3 landed by us & it was a queer sight to see the airmen in their flying togs galloping about on horses for a change, they were all Australians & could all ride, they went up at intervals & flying low over the Turkish trenches open up with their machine guns; B Sqdn of this Regt has to find the Outpost for the safety of the camps tonight ;The Turkish prisoners marched into El Arish today & started across the desert to Railhead; A Russian & a French officer was out witnessing the attack on Maghaba.
