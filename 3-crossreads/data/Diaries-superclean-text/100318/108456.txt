Glisy
soon found Harricks with horses. Rode to Glisy passing through the outskirts of Amiens and heard news there of Swanton being killed and that the battalion has had a very rough time ? over 150 gas cases and a fighting strength of only 180. 200 Yankees are attached to make up the strength. After a yarn with Miles Rodda Aber Co. I went over to the Nucleus and saw the fellows there and talked with different ones. Returned to the Q.M.S and we then put in all the rest of the evening until after midnight discoursing on our various experiences and particularly about the rough times and scenes of Pozieres. Rodda, McCarbin, Harricks what a splendid trio they are to be sure.
