 Dear Mr. Horsfield - Could you give a little assistance to Mrs. Balfour to enable her to get a few things she needs. You have assisted her before about November last year. She has since lost her husband & now has one of the government cottages at Daceyville, where she moved last week - 
 Yours faithfully B. Booth -
