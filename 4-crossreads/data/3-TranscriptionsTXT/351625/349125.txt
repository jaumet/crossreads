very large & fine city, Birmingham is also a very large city but one can't judge these places passing them in the train, but we could see the fields & hedges which enclose the fields & I dont think I have ever seen the likes before.  On Monday morning we had fairly fine weather so I think the aeroplanes took advantage of it as there were numbers flying about all the while, at one time I counted no less than eight in the air at once, occasionally one would fly low down over us and they do go at a pace, they are mostly biplanes, also there was a large dirigible balloon up all day.  I suppose it was for observation.  From our hut looking out across green fields we can see the old Roman Stone Henge that you read about in history.  It is about 2 miles away and looks very large even
