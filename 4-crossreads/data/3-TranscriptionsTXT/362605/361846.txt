 I've not been to Salisbury for some time &amp; I've written to no one because I took no risks of the Flu &amp; went to bed every night before 7 pm.  It is no bon taking risks at this stage of the game.  I was well enough to go to a Dance last night but the musician did not turn up &amp; I played from 6.30 to 10 p.m. without very much music &amp; for all the latest Tangoes, Maxima's etc. I should soon be able to play well if I could only get down to some practise occasionally.  Well, My Dearest Ones, Cheerio.  We are having a pleasant time while waiting for the magic words, "Go Home" to come. So bear up a little while longer &amp; we'll be happy to know that you are not wearying too much.  We cannot expect to be Home for some months yet.  It is getting cold now, nearly 10 p.m. so I'll say Good Night, My Loves.  Harry
