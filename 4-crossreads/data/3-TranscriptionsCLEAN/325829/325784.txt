a heavy cross fire for the advancing enemy, with Machine Gun & Rifle fire. On several occasions the enemy attempted to bring up a Machine Gun to enfilade the left flank of the 2nd L.H., but every such attempt was frustrated by our fire, & our artillery from time to time kept the enemy down by heavy shelling in front of our sector. About midday the 3rd Regt passed through our line & went round the enemy's right flank. We immediately concentrated our fire, occupying the attention of the enemy, & keeping up a heavy covering fire. "B" Sqn on our left sector was never engaged during the day, & all was clear on their front. Late in the afternoon two Sqdns of the 3rd L.Horse withdrew through our line, the other Sqdn withdrawing at dusk. During the day this sector was intermittently shelled by an enemy 4.2 gun also mountain guns but they caused little loss, two horses being killed & two men slightly wounded from long range rifle fire. At dusk the firing died down. At dawn the following morning strong patrols were sent out when it was apparent that the enemy had evacuated their position. On the 11th word came through that L/Cpl McIndoe & Trooper Gofton had been awarded the M.M.
