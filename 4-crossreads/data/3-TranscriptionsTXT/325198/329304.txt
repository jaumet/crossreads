May, 1916later I had some tea but had not eaten any thing since night before - the mare drank so much that she looked like a tub - Capt Ryrie went down to it & looked bad - we gave him some tea & he went back with the ambulance.  At six we started for camp & didn't feel too bad considering   We gave the horses some more water & fed up, they knew they were home & looked contented - Some of the chaps who had stayed in camp made tea for us & it was just great - I had some bread & jam & later went down & had a bath by emptying my buckets of water over my self & didn't I sleep
Wednesday 17thWe saddled up at 8.0 am & came out to some palms & hid our nags up in the shade, its burning  hot but there is plenty water thank goodness,   I just got a letter from Mum & Joe Woods got his long looked for parcel,  Had a bit of an argument with Stevens.  Harold is better this morning - he got in late last night so did Joe Bill & Perce & several others.  Weve lost no horses as yet
