This town the ancient capital of Normandy is right in the heart of history  The innumerable interesting spots connected with the old times are to receive my attention. Joan of Arc was born near &amp; burned here &amp; the great round town in which she was imprisioned is in the centre of the town. Many old houses, doubtless standing for hundreds of years &amp; quaint old French streets, all cobbled   The main streets, Rue de la Replublique &amp; Rue Jeanne d'Arc etc &amp; a fine thoroughfares  many fine shops. Tramway system very good, but the trams are poor. Take a walk to the old Market Place, &amp; here on the street is a tablet, marking the spot on which Joan of Arc was burned</p>
