 Dear Mrs Koch, Many happy returns of to- day with every good wish from both of us. So you see I have not forgotten your Birthday but had I thought of it yes  -  you might have had a chance to get this card in time. I am sorry now that I am so late in sending it. I hope Frieda received my letter during the first week of our stay up here   & that you are all well   &  I presume you are settled down in your new home. Last Monday we moved to "The Luxembourg" Bowral   & letters are forwarded from the Post Office to us here. This is a very nice boarding house. We will leave for Sydney next Monday night the 6th March   &  go straight through  [indecipherable] greetings   &  best wishes from Albert & Augusta The "Gib" is the Hill on the right of the picture
