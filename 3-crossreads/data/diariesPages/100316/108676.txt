24/5/18 
  Rode to Frechencourt to a conference at Bde HQ. All the other Colonels were there and we sat in close conclave all the morning on the lessons to be learnt as a result of the stunt. There was good deal of valuable discussion about different points and we made a number of suggestions. I put in all my recommendations for decorations and hope to get a good lot through. Some rain fell during the morning and laid the dust. With Colonel Brazenor I had a fine gallop back across country and had a hurried lunch before going to the Conference or rather Court of Inquiry. We sat in the Mess and had many artillery men before us hearing their explanation of shorts etc. Very nearly went to sleep while Colonel Cohen was painstakingly crossexamining. The Court closed at 5.30 and I arranged for Clowes to bring a car for me tomorrow and run me down to Pont Novelles. Put up Willoughby Kennett for their commissions and put Pat Gorman on to the job of writing up the history of the battalion. Passed a busy evening writing and doing the many odd jobs that fill in so much of our time. There is a good deal of artillery fire on the front tonight and no doubt a large amount of it is our own as there seems very good reason to expect that the enemy will by strong attacks recommence his offensive tomorrow. Flash and rumble of guns. The wetter conditions will not make the trenches out in front the most desirable places to live as the life is rather too outdoor. My Australian mail is till missing tho? others got plenty of letters.
