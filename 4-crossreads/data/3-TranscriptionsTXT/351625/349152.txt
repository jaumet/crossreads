For ever with the Lord
"For ever with the Lord!"Amen; so let it be;Life from the dead is in that word,'Tis immortality.Here in the body pent,Absent from Him I roam,Yet nightly pitch my moving tentA day's march nearer home.
"For ever with the Lord!"Father, if 'tis Thy Will,The promise of that faithful wordEven here to me fulfil.Be thou at my right hand,Then can I never fail;Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand,Fight, and I must prevail.
So when my latest breathShall rend the veil in twain,By death I shall escape from deathAnd life eternal gain.Knowing as I am known,How shall I love that wordAnd oft repeat before the throne,"For ever with the Lordo"
Amen.
