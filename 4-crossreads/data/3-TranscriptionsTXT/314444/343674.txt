 enough for me to get home to my Dear people, No mistake this is the place that makes you think of home I am sorry you had no luck at the races. Wanted me there. I was thinking of them on the days they were run. Envelopes are scarce so am enclosing notes to Waugh &amp; McKinnon. See they get them. I suppose everything is pretty hard in Sydney. Never mind lets hope is will soon end. We will do our best &amp; I can tell you they don't like us to mix it. Give my kind regards to all friends &amp; say I will meet them at my welcome home. Hoping you are all well &amp; Cheer up the old Tom is doing well With all my love &amp; kisses Your loving Son Tom.
