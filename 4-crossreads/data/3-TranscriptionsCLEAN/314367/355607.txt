  
 By the way we had Grace before & after dinner on Sunday - I was late & only got the latter - It was 'Thank God' - In view of our restricted diet I have suggested another one 'We are not worthy - O Lord - of the least of these thy mercies' I heard this somewhere & it comes in handy - now - One officer - comes across to my room - 2-3 times a day & his invariable remark coming or going is - 'It's a hell of a life going to sea isn't it Doctor?' To which I invariably reply - Thank God I'm only a volunteer for the war - I certainly would not care to be tied down to the Navy but as a volunteer in war time I'm enjoying it immensely - "Such a wonderful service' 'So splendidly paid' 'Such an easy life' says Mr Bumpus 
 Friday Dec 18-14 -  "With our sick beneath the awnings on our road to Mandalay" On Wednesday eveg. I quoted this to our Commander - He & I - the chief engineer - & the navigating  lieutenant all lay  horizontal  on the poop deck - The paymaster was stretched out below & a cook & a steward forward - What happened? All went well until the Wednesday morning - We had prayers - quarters & at 10.30 I was aft in the Commander's cabin - Soon after I felt sick - I attributed this to the motion of the Screws - Shortly after I had to leave & became violently sick & curiously enough got no relief which you always do in seasickness -
