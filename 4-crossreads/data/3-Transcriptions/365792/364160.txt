<p>Mch 26 passed on Port side, with all sails set &amp; running before a stiff breeze Would like to have had the glasses on her. Church Parade at 9.15 (C of E) Rather cool on deck. S.A. parade this afternoon. Have passed several steamers, &amp; the Gulls circle continually above &amp; around the ship. Land has been in sight the great part of the afternoon. In many places it rises sheer from the waters edge. Here &amp; there are detached rocky islets which form a resting place for myriad sea birds, &amp; occasionally one sees a lighthouse or mayhap a small village the buildings showing white against their greeny brown background. The country appears to be but scantily covered with vegetation &amp; on the summits of the hills beyond <strike>small</strike>clumps of trees are discernible.<br/>[in margin] <u>Sunday</u></p>
