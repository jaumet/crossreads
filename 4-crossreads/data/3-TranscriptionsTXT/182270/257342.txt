THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1919.
Fine & cold. Went down to H.Q.
& found my papers were all
ready to be signed. I got another
week's leave. Kieth & Barry
got word to get everything
ready to go in the morning,
so they were bustling round
all day. I went to the pictures
again in the afternoon & stayed
at home at night.
