The majority of these chaps I have met have been decent fellows & are good company. I have come to the conclusion that this skiting & boasting that they are often accused of is simply their manner & is done unconsciously. It is gratifying to see these fellows arriving over here in their thousands, all fresh & eager, the war weary soldiers welcome them.  I am sure they will prove good soldiers. The papers state that they are arriving in this country at the rate of 200,000 a month. "Let them all come" we will want them all before this game is finished. 
 June 30th 1918.- 1st July 1918. A pleasant ceremony was enacted on parade this morning. L,Cpl. Murphy of C Section was presented with the D.C.M. ribbon. His was a most popular recognition, he has done splendid work in the Line. I mentioned in my last report that the Combined Football team of our Brigade chosen from the Ambulances, Pioneers, & Engineers, had won the final football match. Our Ambulance was highly honoured, as seven of the team were in our Unit. After the above presentation, prizes were presented to these 7 men. The authorities were certainly longwinded in sending the prizes along, but of course the old saying still holds good "better late than never". Inspection of the Unit held the following day by the G.O.C. of the Division.   He seemed highly satisfied with the turn out, & in delivering in speech he expressed himself as being extremely gratified.
