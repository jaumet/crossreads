 MONDAY, JULY 28, 1919. 
 Rained nearly all day. I went 
 into town early. Saw Kemmis 
 re plans and he is calling for 
 ammended tenders with certain 
 things cut out. Clyde came home 
 &amp; I had lunch with Marj., Olga, &amp; 
 he at the Wentworth. Met Linda 
 and [Sleepy?] at Farmers for afternoon 
 tea, also Bobbie M c Millan. 
 We got home for dinner.
