 France 1.2.17 
 My dear Mrs. Ferguson, 
 An excellent little parcel.  The only unfortunate part is that I am at present suffering from a very heavy cold and cannot duly appreciate the cigars, I can however all the more fully appreciate the socks.  You know my luck seems always to be wonderfully good.  After being away for just two months, I came back and for 8 days &amp; commanded the Bn.  Then just as the Bn was about to move up into the line, the Colonel came back &amp; resumed command.  I then became second in command and, as such, was left out of the line in command of certain details &amp; things.  So that instead of being in front line, I am now in a comfortable hut with a good brazier burning, and plenty of blankets. 
 Am still getting fine letters from home.  Mother seems to be pushing along very well and working hard. 
 This is the first decent chance I have had to clean up my letter department since I rejoined.  You see one is very busy when one commands one's unit. 
 Best of Love Yours affectionately Caesar
