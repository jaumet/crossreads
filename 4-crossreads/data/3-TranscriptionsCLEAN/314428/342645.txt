  
 Caulfield, Camberwell, Surry Hills, Armadale and back to St Kilda where we stayed about an hour, and was given tea & refreshments by the ladies of the Y.M.C.A. Then we were driven back to the hospital at Elsternwick. It was a fine trip and everyone enjoyed it - though in places the roads were rather dusty. There were several officers with us including Mr Chapman of the 37 Btln. 
 Today I read Professor Lyndall's famous "Belfast Address" in 1874. 
 Friday May 30 1919. 200. A fine day. 
 I saw Mr Sydney Scott this morning about glasses & I am to go into the city this afternoon to get them. 
 I was transferred from Ward 11 to Ward 19 bed 9 today. 
 I obtained my pay book from the Tax Office this morning. I also received a letter from Milne  this morning. This afternoon I walked out to Brighton with Dolly Varden where his people live and spent the afternoon there. We also walked down to the beach and had a look around the boat sheds where the racing boats are kept and were shown over the B.Y.C.
