<p>Saturday 16th<br/>Was going to go to Alexandria for the week end, but as no cash has yet arrived I didnt put in for a pass.<br/>Went to the Races.  The Sultan was present &amp; his private band played during the afternoon.  The afternoon was windy &amp; there was a shower or two of rain  Nevertheless there was a good attendance &amp; a good afternoons sport.  Didnt manage to get away with any felouse although I got on to a couple of winners.</p>
<p>Sunday 17th<br/>Had a good sleep in in the morning as I didnt have to go to the office.  Went down to the Tennis Courts at about 10 oclock &amp; afterwards had a game of Billiards.  Went out to Mr &amp; Mrs Briggs for dinner &amp; in the afternoon went out for walk round the Koubbeh Palace Gardens.  The kiddies also came with us.</p>
