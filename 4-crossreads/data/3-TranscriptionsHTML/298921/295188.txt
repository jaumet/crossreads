<p>August, 1915<br/>Thursday 5<br/>Still here but move this morning it means an extra feed &amp; one more night in a bed &ndash; I could not sleep bed too soft after the Desert. This will be the last ink I expect you will get sorry my writing is cramped &ndash; very pretty here &amp; beautiful climate. As the Knight Templar is returning to Alexandria &amp; it may be a long time before I get a chance to post, send this &ndash; 7 Hospital Ships are in the Harbour &amp; we expect to do something about the -8"- with <strike>Ache Bata</strike><br/>The men are in great buckle &amp; so am I.</p>
