 I am 4 months in France to day, having arrived at Le Havre on the morning of November 23rd. 1916, and have been most of the time in Houplines, Armentieres and the vicinity. It is persistently reported here to night that the Germans are evacuating Lille.  That the French were driven back 6 miles, received reinforcements, counter attacked and drove the Germans back 12 miles. 
 Saturday March 24.1917 The sun is shining out brightly this morning, but there is a bitterly cold wind from the East.  It is doing some good however, for it is a very drying wind.  There was a heavy bombardment last night, and very early this morning, on our front, possibly with the object of preventing the Huns sending reinforcements from this front to the Somme. There has been occasional bombardments during the day, and some brisk firing at enemy aeroplanes.  The arrest of the Ex-czarina is reported from Petrograd.  Fighting from St. Quentin to South of Arras continues during snowstorms.  A hostile party entered our trenches N.E. of Arras but were driven out.
