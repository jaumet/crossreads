Speaking of Comforts Fund reminds me that the Depot at KANTARA has been burnt down which is bad luck. The Y.M.C.A. are here on the beach "Ubiquitous" & the old PIANO too, but the treble notes have been rather damaged by a bomb. Those wearying music lessons were worth it all, to be able to strum now.
General Chauvel who has the Division & one time our BRIGADIER inspected us carefully this morning. He looks to older as we all do & shall do if the end does not come soon. Our Rest!!! will be up in a week then back to the front line again.
SODA TABLETS & the issued RAW LIME JUICE pushed us through by taking the rust off IRONS, BITS etc.
