 EL BURG Relieved yesterday by the Yeomanry but our men are happier away in front where there is the chance of a [indecipherable] or two & an occasional shot. I won a Rooster last night from A Squadron. We each had only 1 & as there are 4 officers in each Squadron we tossed Snakes or Pheasants on Gippy coins, not heads & tails. SNAKE won. 
 [The following crossed through] More letters from England re-addressed by LAURA. Mother Nov. 19th Joe & Daisy Nov. 26th Christmas Card of DOGGIES Thank you for song. Very good - Dolly does not sing or play - I like  Dorothy  from other people, Dolly for myself & YOU.
