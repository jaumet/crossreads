<p>9.7.15<br/>Fri. 9th.  A court case to-day, Cork was sentenced to 5 days fatigues, he should have got nothing as Cooper was the aggressor;  on returning from a swim last night I found a letter block here, sent from Cairo by Arthur Welch.  Geo. Edwards &amp; the stores he went away for arrived to-day, was signalling this afternoon.  Last night there was a few rallies of rifle &amp; machine gun fire &amp; to-day we have had the usual amount of big shells kicking about with Steels Post suffering heaviest as usual.  The stores were issued out this evening before we went for a dip, we got 3 tins of condensed milk, 2 tins of jam &amp; only 6d. worth of rice &amp; oatmeal &amp; no sugar.  I pinched some Indian meal off the beach when coming back for a swim, used half of it for breakfast this morning &amp; traded the rest to Burke for sugar.  Smithers had to go on the Phone to-night in Marsh's place who has fallen sick.</p>
