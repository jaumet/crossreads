he marked me Hospital ship Malaria Fever Dysentry while I was waiting at the Beach which place I got to somehow meeting Father Murphy on the way down, I got hit on the Head with some small pieces of shrapnel which cut the flesh glanced off, "Beachy Bill" got 24 with his shot 20 wounded 4 killed he put it right near where all the men were waiting until the time came for the barge to be loaded for the Hospital ship about 6 in the evening used to be the time when the sick wounded were taken aboard I was very glad to get on board of the Hospital ship to see everything so nice clean to have the first real wash for two months. 
The deck I was on was crowded with wounded men the groans was awful to hear all night long when I woke next morning feeling much better after a nights sleep in a real bed with sheets I noticed that a lot of the beds were empty, they had died during the night had gone over the side "a soldiers end"
Well we at last got to Malta were taken up in Ambulances to St Patricks Hospital where I stopped there about a month as more men were coming in some of us were sent a convalescent camp at Ian-Taf-Fear about 9 miles from Valetta where we had a good time only roll call at 9 am each morning as time went on I got another touch of Dysentry also got yellow jaundice so after this lot I was boarded recommended for 6 months change to Australia went on a Hospital ship again to Alexandria on the way there we received a wireless message from a ship saying she was being chased by a submarine another message later on was being shelled sinking
