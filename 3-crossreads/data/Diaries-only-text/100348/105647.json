Decemmber 1st, 1916.
Worked down at Sydney Camp today. Fitted some more "bow Huts" together. Last night Palmer, Agnew, and I went forageing to Becourdel, a ruined hamlet near here; found a B.E.F. canteen. Found the price of a case of whisky amongst us. Prepared an order; with the necessary signature of an officer; and managed to get a case of "White Horse". With various other provender we boys of 16 Platoon had a "Barbecue" last night I brought home a case of MacKenacies Meat Vegetable rations this evening there was a tin for each of the chaps. Where did I get it? ? Hush! It will keep the wolf from the door for a while. Hard work in this cold weather puts an edge on my appetite that would split a hair.
