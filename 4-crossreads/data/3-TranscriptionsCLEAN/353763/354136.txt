The Grantala too was signalled  -  I hated this because I wanted the lot to myself  -  However I was very nice to the Protector crowd & if they send a landing party you bet I'm there to help  -  Presently we went up on quarter deck & yarned away  Spooner is English - 30 - out 2 years  -  Then our Motor boat hove alongside & Elms & Porter were asked aboard amp; we had Port wine & yarned & then left  -By the way a prize turned up - S.S. Sumatra in charge of a prize crew followed by the Parramatta - a German trader - but ours now  -  She anchored close to us & we steamed round her & had a look at the fat German skipper & the armed blue jackets & thanked goodness we were top dogs  -We then turned the nose of the motor in shore & by Jove the dense jungle & the coco nuts excited our great admiration  -  An intensely green dense jungle almost to the water edge forms the fore shore  -  That extends back & then up go the hills - some low & others cone shaped towering to heaven  -  A shrub some 8  - 10 feet was a blaze of scarlet but I could not determine its kind
