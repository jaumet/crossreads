<p><u>Wednesday 5th May.</u>  At 8am the transport "Sudmark" came alongside for water, pipes were laid from our tanks to hers and pumping commenced.  She is carrying a big crowd of A.A.S.C. who are not yet required ashore &amp; who expect to be returned to Egypt till the troops get further inland.  A number of the complement came aboard and did a lot of purchasing from our canteen.  They are all disgusted with the ship they are travelling on, and well they might be for she is the filthiest ship I have ever seen; there is no accommodation for troops and they have to sleep</p>
