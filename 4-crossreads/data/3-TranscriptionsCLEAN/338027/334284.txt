 Friday, 11th December, 1914 Went along sick at 7 a.m. with the Ketuna she had half her horses off but owing to scarcity of trucks could only take a few off, and those are encamped alongside station waiting for trucks.  We commenced unloading about 2.30 and got up all our stores & waggons & motor car etc.  We believe we will unload horses to-morrow.  General leave granted for whole boat at night of which we took full advantage.  Unfortunately owing to calling and going ashore at all the ports I am like the majority broke. 
 Saturday, 12th December, 1914 When we reached Cairo we took 2 horses each out of the trucks & led them into the station yard where we were served with a much needed cocoa & bread & cheese then we started on our nine mile walk to Maadi, through main streets & busy traffic, and the horses playing up and shying we were in full marching order.  We journeyed through narrow lanes of the Arab quarter and the horses went mad at sight of camels.  It was a wonderful trip the scenery was mag passed pyramids & alongside Nile most of way.  Reached camp at 12 weary but happy & after a dinner of tinned beef & [indecipherable] we had to erect tents & put horse lines.
