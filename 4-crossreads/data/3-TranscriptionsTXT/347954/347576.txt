A very ugly accident happened on this wing (right) last night and in view of the ugly rumours afloat re traitors, etc., it gives one a certain uneasiness when our huge guns belch forth fire & steel towards the enemy over our heads.  The gun was fired & almost simultaneously lodged behind our right flank killing two outright & maiming fourteen.  For the moment it caused a stir but gradually filed down when it was observed how the accident occurred.  An inquiry is to be held but of course as in all army & navy mishaps results will not be known for months.  We were provided a little novelty by our aero during the present week.  Every time he ascends, eager eyes watch his progress through space & when the pyschological (??) moment arrives (the dropping of bombs) glasses & telescopes follow its supposed course until the explosion tells of more death & disaster to the unfortunates who happened to be in the way at the time.  The machine hovered over our heads & then began the usual circle which precedes the bomb dropping.  (The circling is identical with the habitual round & round method which the North American Indians employ when attacking) & then to our
