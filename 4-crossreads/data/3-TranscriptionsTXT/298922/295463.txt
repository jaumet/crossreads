Still outpost. We used to be called the "KIWI" LANCERS in HELIOPOLIS but I am afraid there is nothing of the "exquisite" about us now.
One of our "planes" down today, the pilot rode home on the Tail of his mates machine.
Will post this as we go on a raid tomorrow & I don't like running the risk of being blown out or captured with any Diary on me.
Love to all, hoping ere long we may all be together again.
