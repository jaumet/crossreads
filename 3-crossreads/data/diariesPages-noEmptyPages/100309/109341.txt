17/5/17 Mametz Bouzaincourt 
Up early. A wet morning. Battalion moved to Bouzaincourt via La Boisselle Aveluy. As field officer of the day I started behind and inspected the Brigade camps with the Area Commandants. An astonishing amount of good gear abandoned ? blankets greatcoats ammunition. Pounds and pounds worth. One officer to my disgust ordered a lot into the incinerator!. Soon put him into his place. After getting a clean bill I got into the D.A.A S.M.G's motor and went straight through via Albert. A pleasant drive the country looking well and the trees putting out fresh leaves. Many troops on the march today and much transports. Came into Bouzincourt and saw the Town Major. My billet closed as Madame was at Mass on account of the Feast of the Ascension. The church is an old one (1703) and passing one got a whiff of incense. Had some good talks to different people find my French much improving. At the rear of our billet is a nice little trim kitchen garden, vivid green
