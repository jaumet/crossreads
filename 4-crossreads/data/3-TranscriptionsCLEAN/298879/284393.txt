  
 June 1915 Saturday 19  Fine  Money scarce otherwise I would be enjoying myself entirely. The paymaster has not turned up so far though. 
 Sunday 20 Fine. Church parade for the patients. My chum from the 3rd Batt went back to the Peninsular today with many more chaps who have recovered from their illness. Feeling a bit depressed. Expect to be back myself in a couple of days
