  
 Friday, 23 March 
 Slept down in the cellar last night.  This morning after breakfast I took a stroll round the villages, or one time villages of Reincourt and Bancourt out in Fritz's direction.  Both these places have been levelled to the ground & fruit trees have been cut down.  The extensive scheme of barbed-wiring in these districts serves to indicate that Fitz's original intention was to put up a stern fight rather than to retreat as he is now doing.  The weather lately has been sunny and clear but the bitterly cold March winds are blowing in a gale.
