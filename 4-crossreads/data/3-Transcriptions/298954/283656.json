<p>Sun. 26th May (cont.)<br/>Later we dropped into a Franco-Russian concert in the theatre.</p>
<p>The theatre itself is similar to the one at Karlsruhe, albeit dirtier, but the stage is very well equipped.   The orchestra is splendid, but the performance during our visit was a Russian farce, dreary and apparently full of repetitions.   The place was packed with, and reeked of, Russians &amp; we were absolutely obliged to leave after a few moments.   Two maids from the Graf's house were present.</p>
<p>Graf von Bradow is the commandant of the camp, an elderly, bearded man who leaves everything to his unteroffiziere.</p>
<p>Tue. 28th.<br/>3 parcels arrived for me today.  Wild excitement in the Mess.  Two of bread &amp; one general from Kopenhagen.</p>
