When I get back to Salisbury I have to go before a Medical Board who will consider my case &amp; class me accordingly A class (Active Service Abroad) B Class  ( 3 to 6 months light duty in England) C Class (Permanent duty in England for duration.)<br/>On Saturday 30th Decr. I posted a book to you.  It was one that was given to me at Christmas &amp; as I haven't space to carry it round with me I have sent it home.  Then on 3rd Jany. I went to the N.S.W. Govt. Offices in London &amp; through them sent a cable to you asking for &pound;5 to carry on with.  I signed it "Jabez Leonard W..." &amp; was told it would go through the premier's office.  I think in my previous letter I acknowledged the cable for &pound;12 you sent through the Bank of A'sia.  Then yesterday I sent a week-end cable "Operation appendicitis convalescent fit, Walter splendid five cabled for yesterday."  Waterhouse.  Must close with love to you all<br/>Your loving son<br/>Leo.</p>
