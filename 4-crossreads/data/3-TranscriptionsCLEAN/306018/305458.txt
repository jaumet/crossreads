September 1917at dinner time.  Had a quiet afternoon in camp.
Sunday 16thWent into Ismailia after dinner, had a swim & tea in there, bought a few little requirements & went to the pictures which were very good.
Monday 17thSaid my adieus to Moascar left by the 2 oclock train.  Left Kantara in the trucks, but got a good lie down & managed to get a bit of sleep on the run out.  Got to Rafa just after daylight, had breakfast & lunch there & got a train on the loop line at 12.30.  The Regt shifted camp today & it was dark before I found them.  The day was terribly dusty & windy.  You could only see a few yards through it.
Wednesday 19thHad another dusty day.  Renewed my acquaintance with the Regt.  Things are not at their best.  Its a long way for water & food is not too plentiful or wood to cook it.  A man will have to put up with it.  Canteens are here but prices are enormous now, so one will have to do a certain amount of starvation
