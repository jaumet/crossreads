<p>known as "Leanes Trench" after a W.A. Major. A man was very stiff to get skittled here, &amp; needless to say we lost very few men the last 2 months we were on the penisular. I don't wonder at the 3rd Brig sticking to their trenches so long, they had a Paradise" compared to what we had battled through in.<br/>We were not long in settling down to the old trench life again, it was noticeably colder now though the sun still continued to shine.<br/>On the 1st Nov there was a heavy gale which lasted 24 hours during which time it made a mess of Anzac beach, cases of biscuits bully potatoes were piled all over the place</p>
