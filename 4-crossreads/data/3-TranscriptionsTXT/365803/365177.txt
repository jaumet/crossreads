 I am never optimistic about anything &ndash; least of all alone British Military affairs. Still everything points to a gradual exhaustion of these Hell-Huns &ndash; I pray that our   Cranks - and German &ndash;  Britains  may not step in and stop the proper crushing of those wretches who have blackened the face of the Earth and made this sad world sadder.  Nothing short of the destruction of their whole means of offence will give security to the world from their Criminal ambitions. 
 10.30 pm  I've just returned from Edenbridge in Kent where we have spent a long, cold, and boring day at my daughter in law's cottage. I heard the guns booming all afternoon from Belgium. It goes on incessantly &ndash; like the thudding of Earth with a maul. My wife has deplorable health. Things are worse for her than for me for I know that Each day Ill have the joy of going to the Hospital and forgetting everything in the work and  quaint and interesting people who impart Millbank &ndash; All kind wishes to you dear man    - and yours  R.
