<p>13th  Feb  Wound healing very well.  Am up and about now.  Yesterday I had leave to go <br/>down to Brighton from 2 to 4 pm.  Brighton is a big place, and along the beach there are <br/>scores of big residences lining the promenade.  There is an electric railway along the <br/>beach the only one of its kind in England.  The main feature is the pier which is &frac14; mile <br/>long and on the end of the pier is a beautiful theatre of the best class I have seen, better <br/>in fact than any I have seen in</p>
