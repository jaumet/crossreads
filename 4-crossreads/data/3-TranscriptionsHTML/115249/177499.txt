<p>R.A. to Berrima To Brigadier &nbsp;I have a document detailing officers for armed forces at Paparatava. &nbsp;Rebra Raluana and Luttick. &nbsp;The latter place is high and understood the local name for Herbertshohe. &nbsp;Raluana is to westward of Herbertshohe on the coast. &nbsp;Rebra is <s>high</s>&nbsp;I believe the W.T. Station now in our possession and Paparatava is about eight miles inland on the road to Toma where Governor was yesterday. &nbsp;Do you require any more assistance from me otherwise I will propose to go into Simpsonhafen. &nbsp;Will you have Governor informed that you are now in&nbsp;command ashore and he would communicate with you with regard to handing over control 0740.</p>
