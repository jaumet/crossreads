<p>there was a great Cricket Match here yesterday. Engineers (British) against our Team (3rd A.A.C.S.). Our boys had a great wind. It was a very good game. We watched it for about 1 hour   &amp;  quite enjoyed it. Some of the orderlies are good Tennis Players too   &amp;  they are having a good time now, that we have not patients to nurse. The flowers are beautiful but we never see ant cows or sheep. It is strange to see all the waste ground. fondest love   &amp;  kisses .  From XOXOX  Auntie Eadle OXOXOX</p>
