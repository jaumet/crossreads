Now he made his first attack last month on the Somme where no Aussies were holding the line
Within 7 days all Aussie Divs were at once sent down to do their share in checking Fritz
As soon as we arrived at Amiens we were told that our other 4 Divs that were already in the line, had regained lost ground while Fritz had made an advance on the front we had just vacated
The result being that our Div (1st) after 2 days on the Somme, were rushed back again to the scene of activity in the North.
