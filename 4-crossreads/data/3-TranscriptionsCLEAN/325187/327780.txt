[Friday 4 February 1916]
We seem to spend a lot of . S D. nearly all goes in Tucker but I'm not in debt like many Officers Cairo was an expensive place.Here in camp there is no amusement when Patrols & Field Days are over, tried to buy a Football but there was not one in all Cairo.Talking with a native who spoke English today he wanted to know how long the mares reared their foals as our Horses were so BIG compared to Egyptian Horses.  The Arabs have a custom of carrying their foals in their arms as soon as born & then the Colt is never frightened & knows the smell of a man.
