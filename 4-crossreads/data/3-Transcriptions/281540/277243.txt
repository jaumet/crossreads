<p>29/10/15<br/>earth lifted slightly and then fell back underfoot and the sound was a low muffled boom.  After cessation of the shelling and when the enemy would commence moving about from dugouts, the siege battery suddenly put in some beauties which must have killed some Islamites</p>
<p>Round big sap &amp; passed several stretchers en route for dressing station.  About 1330 engineers entered sap where mine had been exploded taking precaution of wearing gas helmets.  Unfortunately these proved useless and the results have been serious.  There are three men still in the tunnel where they collapsed so they will probably be "mafish".  Lieut. Bowra who was chatting to me here about an hour ago is reported dead but I hope not. Bazeley &amp; Rodda are also bad.  A good many affected</p>
<p>The scene at the Dressing station is distressing the poor chaps writhing in agony so much that they can hardly keep them on the stretchers.  Staff of doctors and dressers hard at work.  Hope Bowra is not dead &amp; others progress alright.<br/>1515.  C.O. says Bowra dead and two others.  I sent Bowra off to fire the mine just an hour before.  Chatting a long time &amp; actually said "It is time to go up &amp; touch her off".  A nice chap.  Most of the men laid out are rescuers who the fumes affected.  Thom also reported dead. 1545.  Went up to "A" Co and had a good spy round through telescope.  Some shells and bombs landing  on</p>
