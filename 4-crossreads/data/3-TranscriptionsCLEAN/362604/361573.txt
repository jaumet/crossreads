Miles.  I had my pick of the Dances & there were some bonnie dancers there too.  I took my little Friend Home to the Close & just managed to get out before the Gates were locked at 11 p.m.  I went up to Mr. Edmonds place then where I had left my Bike.  As it was raining & I was tired, and it was cold & I was hungry & sleepy, I had supper & told them as I used to tell them at Bess' Home, that I was going to stay the night.  They were pleased & in fact suggested it, so about 1 p.m. I got between the sheets in a lovely feather bed.  I abhor feather beds but I was so tired that I slept till 6a.m.  & then got up.  Marion got my Breakfast of Tea, Toast & scrambled eggs & I set out at 7 a.m. for Camp.  Three miles out I met a Tommy on the Bike so I had company for 5 miles or so.  It was black night when I started but I was Home at 8 a.m. for Breakfast & before Ellis was out of bed.  Just fancy trying to get me to do those sorts of tricks in civi life.
Well, Dad, there's lights out.  Ellis is Orderly Sgt. & will be in about half an Hours time.  I want to write a few lines to George before I turn in.
Happy New Year & Best Love
From Harry.
Hope to start the next one with you all.
