1917 Sunday 20 May
A fine joyous day. Duties per usual. Afternoon off. Bath then sleep a little, read. Jockey sick Wait on him. 
Over to cliff after tea write up diary. Back to Y.M.C.A. to evening service. Tis when we sing the peerless old hymns of our church amp childhood that the longing for home kindred rushes upon one to be once more back to the old house haunts faces. How this heart cries out in longing for it all. That this awful slaughter  be stopped. That at the wickedness that stalks abroad open unashamed. War develops the beast in human beings to a shocking extent. Is the war to be one of extermination? The Almighty's way of purging the race --- if so there are many to fall yet.
