<p>Oh how I fain would be today<br/>"Australia" with thee</p>
<p>The cattle I see grazing<br/>In the fields of verdant green<br/>Across the plain my dear old home<br/>The fairest to be seen<br/>My dear sweet faced old mother,<br/>And the dear grey haired old dad,<br/>Are waiting in Australia<br/>To welcome home their lad.</p>
<p>My countree how I miss thee<br/>When I'm in strange lands alone<br/>My heart will ever be with thee<br/>My countree &amp; my home<br/>My eyes they oft are dim with tears<br/>My heart is full of pain<br/>For Australia &amp; the homefolk<br/>I ne'er might see again.</p>
