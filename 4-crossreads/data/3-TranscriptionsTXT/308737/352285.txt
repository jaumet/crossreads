 Claudius. Look you here Mormy &ndash; dont go slinging boiling water around your house &amp; scalding thighs etc. Really you might have had a bad timer that time if you had'nt had thick cloths on. And you did'nt tell me, either It was Nance or Joan that "split" on you. I believe, if you had lost or scalded all your thighs, youo would'nt have told me. Well I'll knock off now darlings. 
 I'm so glad your getting that tin all right I was afraid there would be delay etc. 
 I feel proud to be able to supply a few necessary things, "duds" etc, to my mormy. 
 Cheer-oh sweethearts &amp; Best Love to yourself Your boy John
