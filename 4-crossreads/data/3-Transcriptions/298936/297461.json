<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Monday 1</p>
<p>Busy day helping Bonner with an annex to the Hospital. Sawed wood in the morning until I thought that my arms would fall off.</p>
<p>Lately the artillery seem to have sprung to life again for a day never passes without a few shells from the "Olive Grove" &ndash; five &amp; six at a time instead of singly as formerly. Turks have evidently established fresh batteries there.   The firing is not one sided [indecipherable].</p>
