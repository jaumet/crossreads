<p>going to say) started tearing things about a bit. We got free feeds at the Dago&#39;s shops, and from one firm we got free cigarettes (I don&#39;t say that the owners gave of their stock willingly I simple state a fact that we got them free) I&#39;m afraid a few shop windows were broken, in our excitement. Later in the evening the Camp Commandant arrived from Blackboy Camp,and he had a quiet and sensible talk with some of the fellows he met, the&nbsp;ultimate result being that we all returned with the Camp Com. to camp.</p>
<p>I really think the C.C. and the officers thoroughly enjoyed the fun, and I think they&nbsp;were also of the opinion that we should be allowed to travel on our railways free, on production of a &quot;leave pass&quot;. However, I guess the railways lost through their foolish action.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the very tactful way in which the C.C. handled the&nbsp;situation that night, well! there would have been trouble. We were all at thoroughly &quot;fed up&quot; with the foolery and humbug. Subsequent to this the arrangement was unanimously agreed to, viz:- to deduct one shilling per fortnight from our pay.</p>
<p>Just remember this unsavoury state of things with the railways had been going on for nearly two years, and noone had sufficient brains, apparently, to put forward some tangible scheme.</p>
<p>What a brain the man must have who suggested that we should all buy tickets to Perth, before our &quot;leave passes&quot; could&nbsp;be issued. Hundreds of men never wanted to go to Perth. I always or nearly always went in the opposite direction, and why should I be compelled to buy a ticket to Perth? However between the action we (as a body) took and the final arrangement, we were allowed to travel free. So that&#39;s that.</p>
