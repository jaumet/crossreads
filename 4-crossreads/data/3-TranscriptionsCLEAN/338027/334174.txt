Tuesday 4 May, 1915Had a good night, patients all slept well, there was a guard placed on the delirious man.  Three more train loads of wounded came to Cairo, patients sent to Giza Anglo Egyptian and Kasr el Aini Hospitals.  The suffering I see is awful, I am getting quite used to it now.  I have eleven wounded to dress and one man with Rheumatic Fever, he is in frightful agony.  Could not sleep during the day so went up to the camp only to learn that some of the men are going to day to Alex to [indecipherable] in the transports.  Sammy is very ill and is down at the Vet lines, he is not expected to recover, he has gone quite mad, I would not like to see him die as long as I lost him
Wednesday, 5 MayLast night I went on duty and then was informed that I had to go down to Luna Park for duty.  There were 600 patients and only three men and one night sister to attend to them.  I was run off my legs and to make matters worse a fellow that was mad through shrapnel wounds in the head escaped and we had to search with hurricane lamps for him, he was found under a bed stark naked.  When I was relieved in the morning I was I was as tired as could be.  At last the good news we are off at last although as Infantry.  The men paraded and offered to go dismounted, it was a great sacrifice for a Light Horseman.
