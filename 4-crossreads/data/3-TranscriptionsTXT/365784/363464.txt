4.have remained at their bases, but their appeal was ignored. Colonel Barratt at Heliopolis seems to have commandeered all our Red Cross Stores & Funds - why he didn't supply the transports no one seems to know. He is in Charge of the No 1 Aust General Hospital & really cannot have time to attend to that & the Red + Work too. Something or someone must suffer!
He was given 500 to the YMCA at Alexandria from the Red Cross Funds but our men lack Red + stores of all sorts!
I have not told my husband that I am writing to you for he would say that I have no business to criticize his superior officers, but I feel that people at home ought to know how little is being done here for the actual welfare of our men.
Of course the local YMCA is very good, but many of the men fight shy of it. I wish you could take a run over here, but am afraid you would find the heat too trying. Miss Owen would revel in the colouring & quant scenes - her clever brush would get heaps of subjects here.
Hoping you are well & with kind regards to yourself & Mt Owen
I remainYours very sincerelyIrene V Read.
