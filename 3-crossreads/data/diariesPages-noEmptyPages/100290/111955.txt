"Weighed anchor" at 3.30 p.m. after having a good rest. Incident of the throttled hen old French woman's anger. Passed through Flessnes. Crossed railway line on road to Amiens. Aerodrome. Plodded on with full pack up thro? one village after another, all filled with soldiers.- finally pulling up at Allaville where we are quartered for night in hay loft. Very comfortable till old French woman comes in kicks up row for tramping over her threshed wheat. Village sold out of eatables. That lovely avenue of trees.
