 9/2/17 Support Fire Line . Le Sar Shave in bunk in a messi fashion and onc more feel unwel owe to this dugout life and the rotten feel of nausea that the vitiat air in these place alway give me . What with smell of cook and the concentr carbon breath of so mani men sleep down below it alway make me feel as if I want to be sick . Went over to Duggan at the line headquart pass over snow cover ground , a clear sun shine but a wind that was below or at ani rate littl over zero . Men at work with pick and shovel fill sandbag with ice in order to use it for make tea . " Get a bag full of water " as one put it . An excel trench and a fine dugout as HQ . . Not far off is a good O.P. and artilleri offic were do a shoot . The villag of Le Sar is the usual mass of ruin . From here we look right over Bosch line and can see him move about freeli . The whole scene is domin by the Butt de Warlencourt an old tumulus or burial place which is about 50 feet
