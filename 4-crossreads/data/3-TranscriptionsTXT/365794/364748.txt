Ord. collars at Esthers (call Friday) &amp; 1 cap. Went to mosque &amp; loved it all, heard the call to prayer &amp; very quaint it sounded, then climed the minaret &amp; viewed Cairo by "after sunset" light, very fine and wonderful old building, one built 1356 A.D. 6 hundred years old impresses one with awe.  We encased our feet in huge slippers &amp; walked on "holy ground" &amp; saw the tombs of the father &amp; son who built the mosque.  Wonderful inlaid wood &amp; one part of ceiling shown where Kitchener had it cleaned.  Cannon ball still in hole in outer wall from Napoleon's time.
