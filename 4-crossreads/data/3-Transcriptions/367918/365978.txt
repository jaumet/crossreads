<p>I am living in great style on a Dahabiyeh or house boat on the Nile at Ghezireh. There are 5 officers &amp; the wife of one of them besides myself living on it and we are very comfortable.  It is a big affair with 6 cabins (one double berth) &amp; a large dining room, two bathrooms, kitchen pantries etc on one deck &amp; the top deck is devoted to lounges etc &ndash; sort of drawing room affair. It is a bit out of the way but a car calls for us each morning &amp; brings us back for lunch &amp; in the evening so that's not so bad. We are just opposite the sporting club which is an advantage.</p>
<p>I am not sure yet of my future movements. I am hoping to effect a trip to England with some hospital work attached &ndash; for six or twelve months, before returning to Australia but dont know what my chances are in the ballot. There are a good many entries &amp; all cant get a place. If I slip for that I dont quite know what I shall do &ndash; perhaps return &ndash; perhaps get my discharge here or in England. I'll decide when the time comes.</p>
<p>Remember me very kindly to Mrs. Ferguson and, with kindest regards believe me</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>R.J. Hunter</p>
