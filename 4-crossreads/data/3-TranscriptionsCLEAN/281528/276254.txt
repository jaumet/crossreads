  
 27/3/18 - La Basse Ville mine craters of the Messines show.  General Birdwood pointed out Warneton & other places to "Chris".  Talked with him about the War and he was very pessimistic and not half as cheerful as we are here, sleepless & lousy.  As one dirty old Billjim said, "We've stopped Fritz before we'll stop him again!"  Darky Johnson asked him if there was any truth in the rumour that we were being relieved here by the W.A.A.Cs.  There is a furphy that 300 W.A.A.Cs were taken prisoner at Bapaume.  Also that an Irish division is going to relieve us here.
