 seen Harri yet . I may see him befor I leav for Franc , and I may not . He arriv at Salisburi about the 28th of Dec. but he will have told you all his experi . So far I have onli receiv one letter from him , I expect there is anoth somewher that I will receiv someday . The weather is just the same I wouldnt mind live in England . . dure the summer for about two summer , that is provid I had suffici money to go tour but England in the winter , is a dreari hole . Overhead a grey dull Ski , not a ray of sunshin for day , then the stori we read of a snow clad world etc . are all imagin , it is onli in part , and we can do that much out in Australia , true it will start and snow at night in the morn you look out , and everywher it is white , and veri pretti , but by 10 am it has near all gone as silent as it came and it leav a nice slushi mud to help make life miser . then when the sun doe eventu get out , it has no warmth in it but it doe not shine long . This war will perhap do the British peopl some good , it will teach the class that their veri exist depend almost entir on the mass , up to the present they the upper ten have done noth in fact mani of them have tri to keep the work man down . they did not want him to rise , so they would not tri to help him , instead they , or mani of them threw all sort of obstacl in his way . " The wealthi tradesman who had made his money , manag to get a littl somehow and then look down on the good old Aristocrat who had just gone on the same for year live , or starv " as the case might be on his fine old estat that had been hand down generat after generat tho . gentleman in turn look with scorn on the Titl Tradesman "becaus he was jealous I expect " - and so it goe on they are too narrow mind and too snobbish to realis that , a Tradesman can be a gentleman also , and they teach their children the same even today . the men who had the money and did not have to work , there was no need . They sent their son to colleg and paid for an expens educ for them , but how much did a lot of them learn . it was too much [indecipher ] [indecipher ] they were good at Footer or Row Cricket etc . but everywher els a number of them were failur the one who came out as success , were those who had to Battl for their live either , with their brain or hand so they had to work . now the war is make a lot of them think , but it is from amongst the one who had to work that some of their best men are come . the other are not up to much they are rather good at do noth except talk at the Club . Thing were rather pleasant here for Xmas . a certain amount of leav was grant but the men were not allow to travel on the Railway , the author had some fool Idea in their head , soldier must not travel , presum becaus the train servic was alter and there was a shortag in Roll stock , yet , everi paper advertis the Xmas Holiday Resort , and Holiday maker seem to be enjoy themselv as usual " but soldier must stay in Camp for Xmas . one man told me that , leav was onli grant Xmas week in extrem case such as sick at home and then two day onli . I am speak of men who have relat on this side of the world . But the Issu of order forbid troop to travel on the train did not deter a few of them from go . I do not blame them . I did onc . But now Good luck to the man who beat them , and get away . I had my Photo taken sometim ago here in Wareham but I do not like it much howev everyon seem to consid that it is a first class like , perhap that is whi I do not care for it I am send a coupl out , also some that I had taken when at Wallington . I am also send Madg one . She is as you know the W.A. Lassi I have not heard from her for some time . When you see Aunt Nelli again will you pleas thank her for her Card allso Ivi for her letter I will write as soon as possibl , but write in these hut is far from pleasant as the Tabl are near allway in use . men play card etc . and they make write quit a task . When up at Wallington I went out for sever walk sometim with Harold . sometim with Mrs. Horton and onc with Elsie onc with Edgar . But I did not go up to Lunnon to see the sight , Lunnon in winter doe not appeal to me ani it 's a dreari sort of place , especi when it rain . I mean , you know what I mean so I wont explain . I was advis onc to see the Tower and Bridg , but I have heard so much about them that they have lost interest for me no doubt I would enjoy see them but somehow when I go to ani of those sort of place by myself I alway start wish that someon els was there with me and they I begin to lose Interest in them .
