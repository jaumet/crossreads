<p>kind smile but he is not much of a speaker as he cant say his rs.<br/>There are two chaps in the tent now who are gentlemen alright; one that Rostron dellicate chap I was telling you about; knew cousin Jocelyn and was a Lieutenan in the Queensland Artillery some years ago.<br/>The other one is Bateau; the poor chap I told you that I heard was killed at the riding test, only he did not die and is a jolly nice chap.  Could you make me a husine or house-wife or what ever you call it?  Aunt Katie gave me a temporary one but it is not much good.  I saw a beauty today; made out of American leather I think and it folded up to the size of an envelope and had pockets for all the things.<br/>The first night in camp the passing trains did worry me so, the tent is with in 50 yds of the line and it is the main Southern so you can imagine the row;  I kept waking thinking  it wa I was at home and the rain was pouring on the roof.  I am used to it now though.  We have a free picture show here now; run with our comforts fund money which is more amusement for the evenings.<br/>Our troop sergeant is Fraser, who used to be jackaroo on Winbar with Cousin Jocelyn.  I do hope the sheep bring a good price; wish I was there to take them in.<br/>Heard to day that you could fatten cattle by turning them out in the streets of Tamworth the feed is so lovely up that way.<br/>I must stop now.  Love to Father<br/>I am your loving son<br/>Rob</p>
