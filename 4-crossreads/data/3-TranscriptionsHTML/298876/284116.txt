<p>Thursday<br/>4.2.16</p>
<p>100 Infantry, 200 L Horse, 19 A.G.H. men came on Board at 7.30 am, not sorry either I have handed the Hospital work over to them, they are all returned A.G.H. men, so hope to get out of all Hospital work. Seems strange to see the Possum skins around the hats of the N.S.W. L.H.</p>
<p>Left Sydney 1 pm &ndash; showery. Sent the deserters back to Brisbane. A lot of Boats followed us down the Harbour to the Heads. Ran into a storm about 8.30 pm. Have orders to take charge of Hospital &amp; Dispensary at night from 6 pm to 6 am &ndash; rather liked it &ndash; one very bad case reported sick 10.30 pm, had to dig out the Doctor &amp; Nurses. Have 7 Nurses on Board now.</p>
