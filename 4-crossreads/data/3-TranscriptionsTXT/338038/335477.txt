 Dear Mrs Garling, You will have had the heavy news of your son, Major Garling's, death of wounds on the 5th.  I saw him when brought in to the dressing station &amp; got the doctor to attend to him quickly but he had lost much blood &amp; soon succumbed.  I buried him yesterday in the Warloy-Baillon Cemetery.  Some of his boys who are very fond of him, were there &amp; they told me they intended putting a good cross over his grave. With my deepest sympathy Yours sincerely Sydney Buckley Chaplin
