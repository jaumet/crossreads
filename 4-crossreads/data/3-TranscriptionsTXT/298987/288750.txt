Monday 25th March 18Unloaded some trucks this morning Moved camp in afternoon about 1 mile back to where the remainder of a Company are camped. The four of us managed to secure a dugout on our own again. It is a miserable little afair not nearly as good as the one we built at our last camp Managed to get hold of some good bunks & have made  our selves quite comfortable Yesterday was quite hot today the reverse A lot of rumours that we have had a big reverse about Bapume. Hope they are untrue
Tuesday 26Went out at 7 a m in a motor transport. Very crowded rough trip. Started excavating for the new job - another M.G. post - It was a very clear day & we had a good view over the Hun lines. Do not know whe we are working here in the day time as the Hun must be able to see us quite planely
