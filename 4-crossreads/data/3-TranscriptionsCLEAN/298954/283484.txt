  
 Sun. 17th June The first shot gashed a hole amidships abt 4 feet above the water line - the flame from the shell rose right over the funnel. 
 For some time the shells were directed amidships.   The gunnery was apparently poor - one shell burst in the water between the two vessels when the distance was only a couple of hundred yards. 
 At about 11.30 am shells were put into nos 1 and 2 holds - the cargo of which burst into flames. 
 The "Wolf" circled slowly around the "Wairuna" which now listed heavily to port with smoke pouring from her hatches. 
 A couple more shots finished her - at about 1230 p she slowly settled over on her side, the burning cargo bursting from her hatches as she went under. 
 The funnel snapped off as it went down. 
 In all 16 shells were fired at her.
