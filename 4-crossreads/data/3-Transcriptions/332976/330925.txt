<p>September 1917<br/>21st    No 3 Sectn. have gone up to Ypres on road construction &amp; No 3 are working in shifts near Hooge.   The others are continuing with the "Bow" huts on which we will be for a considerable time in all probabilities.   No further news has been received regarding yesterday's stunt &amp; the infantry are now consolidating the new line under the charge of the 1st &amp; 2nd div. Engrs, ready for another "hop-over"   Fritz counter-attacked to-night after a heavy bombardment which was retaliated by our own artillery, but we do not know the results yet.   At dusk to-night one of Fritzs planes came over above the clouds &amp; dived onto one of our ballons, setting it alight with his machine gun.   At about 10 P.M. another of his planes came over, but the search-lights found him &amp; before he had time to get back, the gunners brought him down in flames.</p>
