<p>Dear Mr. Fry,<br/>Allow me to thank you very much for Mr. Edmonds sermon you so kindly sent us, I cannot tell you how much we value the sermon &amp; the kindly sympathy which prompted you to let us have &ndash; now we can go to it for refreshment &amp; strength which it all contains, but for you it would have been more or less lost to us &ndash;</p>
<p>We send our Sympathetic Greetings to dear Mrs. Fry yourself &amp; family looking forward with Hope for the future</p>
<p>Mrs Cuthbert bids me say the sermon you were so good to send her will remain a valued possession words fail me to properly describe our feelings for your thoughtful service</p>
<p>With our deep regards to Mrs Fry, yourself &amp; family</p>
<p>Believe me<br/>Yours Most Sincerely<br/>[indecipherable] Cuthbert</p>
