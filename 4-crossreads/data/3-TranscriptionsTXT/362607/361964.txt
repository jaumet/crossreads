 3.6.17 Dear Dad,  Just a few lines to let you know all is going on well. I went to Salisbury yesterday &amp; had a look around &amp; met some nice people too. I saw about 20 Tommies invested with the M Medal in the Market Square. The Mayor &amp; his myrmidons were present in full Regalia &amp; about 20 Staff Officers. It is my first view of a Mayoral Function. It is a very gay &amp; costly set of Roles etc. We had a very fine day too. The Australians in out Camp play the Tommies but our boys were beaten. This Picture shews a view of the Avon where the Amesbury Bridge crosses it. The old Church is on the left opposite the Cottages, shewn. There is a Church Army hut &amp; Canteen on the land by the River side which has just been erected.  Love Harry
