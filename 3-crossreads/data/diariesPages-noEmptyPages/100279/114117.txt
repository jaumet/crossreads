was going merrily Mr Page suddenly leaps off his seat grabs hold of his thigh I thought he must have sat on a pin or something, when the laughing giggling died down a little he explained that he had the cramps in his leg, more laughing plenty of offers of assistance to rub him down etc, but we fixed him up after a while the game proceeded, then followed some recitations pretty hot ones too, afterwards songs stories, altogether we had a most pleasant evening, I think it will be remembered by all of us for many many a day to come of course according to Kings rules Regulations this sort of thing is altogether wrong
