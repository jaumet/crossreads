 26/1/18 London Fine and warmer but dull . To the Bank via Underground and got out at Mansion Hous . Walk up past the Bank of England and then right up Threadneedl St . A solid mass of financi hous and bank ? not a pretens to beauti anywher but solid wealth and stodgi . Seedi clerk wear that emblem of respect ? the top hat . Crowd of peopl run in and out of those place so like rabbit warren . Pass through Gracechurch St . down round Old Jewri and other side street . To Cheapsid down to St Paul and found a servic go on there . Read a few letter and then went down Fleet St and the Strand to Chare Cross . Caught tube there and so back to the hotel and one more meatless day . I grow sick of egg and fish . Cawthorn rang
