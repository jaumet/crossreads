<p>[On back of Docks picture]<br/>Dardanelles 3 June 1915<br/>Dear Girlie<br/>Am quite well. The chap who was my mate in the orderly room was shot<br/>in the foot. The man who accidently broke my glasses has been<br/>shelled. I shall shall have some great tales to tell if I come back. My<br/> step father has also enlisted. I have no paper or envelopes and the<br/> censor ship is very strict indeed, we arrived here on 17 May. I am<br/> getting plenty of tucker. We live on the side of the hill the Australian and<br/> N.Z. men stormed when they landed and have dug out places  in the<br/> earth to protect us from the shrapnel shells on top. The weather is<br/>splendid  you know more of the news than we do.</p>
<p>Passed by no. 2199 Censor</p>
<p>Addressed to Miss Flo Ryan at Clarenden st.</p>
