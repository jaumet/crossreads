3/12/16.Did a half days work today, then went for a bath; at the new bath house in the valley. I had not bathed for quite a while; and thought it would kill me, it was delicious however. Working on the demolishing gang. I am all admiration for the industry of the Bosche. His labour has made the country round here like a gigantic rabbit warren. I don't wonder that he thought this position impregnable. Some of the communication tunnels are hundreds of yards long.5/12/16.Had a novel expierence yesterday; a fine clear day. Hamilton "V.C." joined up again today, with other details and reinforcements. Have received much Christmas mail. Nothing to do today except keep warm.
