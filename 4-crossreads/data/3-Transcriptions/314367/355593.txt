<p>Wednesday<br/>9-12-14  Yes &ndash; It's interesting &ndash; this life under the White Ensign &ndash; a hard, simple life &ndash; I was up at 6 am &ndash; Had a cup of tea &amp; biscuit &ndash; then a salt water tablet. There is <u>no</u> shower - <u>no</u> bath room &ndash; We've got a screen rigged up on deck &amp; a bath inside which the men fill with salt water &amp; in you go &ndash; All is fixed routine &ndash; Chow at 8 &ndash; Mine was some tinned whitebait &ndash; bread &amp; black currant jam &ndash; Bread will be off &amp; biscuit take its place until Cairns is reached &ndash; Sick parade at 8.30 &ndash; I have one man with a Temp 103.8 &ndash; ? Pneumonia &ndash; I report &ndash; on a printed form &ndash; to the Commander by 9 am &ndash; Then Quarters &ndash; Prayers &ndash; then physical drill for the men &ndash; To-day they ran from the main deck up 10 steps on to the Anchor deck &ndash; round &amp; down &ndash; then up &amp; round &amp; so on &ndash; This took 15-20 minutes &ndash; then came gun drill &ndash; big! Guns &amp; the quick firers &ndash; Of course live shells are not fired but all is gone thro &ndash; The magazines are opened &amp; you see shells going forward &amp; aft &ndash; The gunner stands to his gun &amp; his orders come crisp &amp; sharp with monotonous regularity &ndash; After &frac12; - &frac34; hour &ndash; gun drill is over &amp; everything goes back to its ordained place.</p>
