<p>13-4-17<br/>Fri 13th<br/>Last night the troops were digging trenches all night; I had to send out sigs to two observation posts early this morning, all the horses were led into the barley for grazing this morning; We were in touch with all squadrons . B.H.Q. &amp; the 2nd regt per Helio &amp; had some good practice; At 9.30 Sutherland &amp; I decided to visit the Obervation posts as we could get a view of Gaza from one of them, both Posts were on top of deserted mud buildings; lizards of every description can be seen on any of the buildings &amp; there is nothing inside any of them but remnants of broken earthenware</p>
