  
 lady-in-charge there, did not get on too well with our O.C. or M.O's. so vented her temper on us. We are awfully sorry because before  she  came we were all very happy  &  agreed awfully well. 
 Anyhow we are now separated from 29th C.C.S. but can invite our friends to our Mess room. Most likely we shall have living rooms soon. Hope I can stay here for sometime longer.
