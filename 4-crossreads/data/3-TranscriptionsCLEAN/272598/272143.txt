Wednesday 27.12.16Leave granted to Amiens.  Paraded with sore feet, remained in camp whole of day.
Thursday 28.12.16Walked to Vignacourt, but was unable to get back for hours owing to trouble with my feet.  While waiting there was caught by cold & would have fainted only for the timely assistance of "Bobbie Roberts" who was in the village temporarily attached to a "Pierrot" show.  Not feeling at all well.
Friday 29.12.16Admitted to hospital with "trench feet" Rained during day.

Sunday 31.12.16New Years Eve.  Tried to see the old year out, but could not manage to stay up
