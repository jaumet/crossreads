  
 Tuesday 3 April 
 Raining & windy.  In the evening two of our observation Balloons which had been put up for the first time in Grevillers suffered badly.  Fritz flew across in precisely the same manner as on the 1st inst. and dropped fire bombs on both, bringing them down in flames.  It was a wonderful & brilliant feat.  However we knocked the plane out nearer the front line so the loss has been evened up a bit.  The other Fritz who was responsible for Sunday's feat was also brought to earth.  500 wounded from our 54 & 55th Batts. in the recent fight, but Fritz's losses were heavier.  The 8th F. Amb. went out to assist the 15th with the stretcher-bearing.  6 German counter-attacks have been repulsed.  Heavy gun firing is going on in the direction of Arras.
