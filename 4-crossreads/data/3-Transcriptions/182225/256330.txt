<p>Fine &amp; hot. We all went to a church parade at Larkhill. The Bishop of Salisbury was preaching &amp; he gave us a very decent little sermon &amp; we could hear all he said, which is more than can be said for most church parades. Bill &amp; Jack Hunter &amp; Warren Hogarth &amp; Self got a car &amp; went into Salisbury for dinner. We expected to meet Mother but she did not turn up. Had lunch at the Country&nbsp;Hotel. We saw Capt &amp; M<sup>rs</sup>&nbsp;Chicken there &amp; had a long yarn. Walked round town afterwards &amp; went all over the Cathedral. It is a wonderful place inside &amp; quite the most beautiful I have ever seen. You seem to be in a different world when you get inside. Had dinner at the Country Hotel &amp; got a car back to camp.</p>
