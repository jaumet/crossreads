<p>Wednesday 18 April 1917</p>
<p>Another hot day. Big guns firing all around &amp; enemy planes bombing &ndash; got a headache but could always do 3 nights out of bed at the Picnic Races so can do it now. All is going well &amp; the SKYLARKS singing many a brave man's Requiem.</p>
<p>In advance tonight moving out at 11 p.m. &amp; my Squadron took up a position before dawn in a deep donga. Turksshelled us all day could not even light a Fire to boil the quart. Can see great activity in Turksroads. Fought on hill near 470.</p>
