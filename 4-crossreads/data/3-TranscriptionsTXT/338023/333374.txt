 Hear from a pal in the Coy &ndash; that a parcel arrived from Mr Allnutt &amp; was much enjoyed by the remaining sigs. Will you write and thank Mr. A. please &amp; say I enjoyed the good things by proxy &ndash; nothing wasted. Things seem to have been pretty lively out there but never forget the cause that thousands are ready to fight for must have strong arguments in its favor &ndash; the mere fact that it causes you a heap of annoyance is not any reason to condemn it &ndash; our war no doubt causes more discomfort for a cause less vital in the eyes of the worker who has little to lose. There is nothing noble about that strike &hellip;there is nothing even human about the 'Jungle of Strafes.' 
 I note that the jingle entitled "The Storm Riders" has been well received by sundry critics but don't go much on it myself &ndash; because it is "Bulletin ise" after all &amp; therefore not quite there. Have scribbled other scraps one of which is given herewith &ndash; but I don't feel quite capable of literary effort with the mud of Flanders still heavy on my soul. I can write of that but not for sane eyes to read. Love to one &amp; all from Harry.
