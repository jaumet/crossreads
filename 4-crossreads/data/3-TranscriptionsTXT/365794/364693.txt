 Wednesday 17 October 1917 Slept on deck or tried to but in vain did I try &amp; yet it is beautiful there, fresh air &amp; the stars overhead, rose 5.40 a.m. &amp; a glorious morning. Attacked by S. Macdonald &amp; strained relations exist.  Why cannot she leave us both alone as we do her? Day's routine same as ever.  Read "Nursing" 7 to 8.30 a.m., knit balaclava, read, play patience &amp; quoits.  We are nearing the end of our journey &amp; little frictions occur daily which once we are at work will I trust be less frequent &ndash; baths are daily source with some of them.  Daily the loss of someone to whom one could really talk &amp; learn from grows more acute.  Moral &ndash; one should devote all one's life &ndash; if needful &ndash; to finding either man or woman with whom there is some understanding!
