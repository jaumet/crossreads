<p>Tuesday 4<br/>A beautifully fine but very cold day. Another heavy frost.</p>
<p>Wednesday 5<br/>Another fine day &amp; cold.<br/>This afternoon I took a train ride from Pont des Briques to Hardelot on the sea, south of Boulogne. It is a fine watering place with a nice beach, tiled promenade, tennis courts etc. The houses are modern <strike>billets</strike> villas and look very nice.<br/>The wood, planted in the dunes is fine &amp; mostly of pine trees. On the route is an old castle where Henry VIII lived while the Field of the Cloth of Gold was on. A fine old house in Pont des Briques is where Napoleon 1st planned his Austerlitz Campaign 1805-6.<br/>In fact the whole place abounds in historical interest. At Ardres (Sept 16.) the Camp of the Field of the Cloth of Gold</p>
