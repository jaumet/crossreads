<p>Parramatta<br/>German New Guinea</p>
<p>Dear Guy,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/8/14<br/>We're off to try to smash the Germans in New Guinea; they are supposed to have two or three pretty decent ships there, but hope we1 ba able to account for them.<br/>We three destroyers are to open the Ball by a night attack<br/>&#151; if we can get in &#151;on the ships which we hope to find at anchor in Simpson&acute;s Haven; we don&acute;t know the harbour or what forts there are or whether the channel will be sown with mines, so it's rather an exciting proposition &#151; has painting the Warden&acute;s doorstep done to a frazzle!<br/>If we get scuppered and I get ashore I hope I give a bellyache to the first cannibal who gorges himself off me!<br/>The Harbour is something like this [image] and we are to walk right in and fire pedlis (?) promiscous like &amp; rush out again like hell if we can, I wish we could get get some news of events on t&acute;other side; we don&acute;t use wireless because we don&acute;t want to betray our nearness.<br/>W. being a wireless station.<br/>We've had a pretty filthy time since leaving Sydney; it&acute;s a long way up here in a destroyer.<br/>So long Sonny, give my love to Nell &amp; Johnny &amp; all your people. Chin chin to all the boys. I&acute;m going&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to send this to the flag to-morrow if I can as they have a better&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chance of reaching a Post Office than we have.<br/>Yours<br/>A.B.D.</p>
