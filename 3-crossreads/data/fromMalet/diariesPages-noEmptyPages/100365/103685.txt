Walloy Senlis are now camped between Senlis Albert. On the way through Walloy we saw them burying the men who had died in Hospital we felt very sad. Hundreds of rude little crosses mark their last resting place. The roads were very dusty on account of the great amount of traffic over them, necessary to the movements of an Army.The Germans gave us a pretty lively welcome in the nature of big shells it lasted all night.We were standing on a high ridge of land watching them burst. They were aiming at Albert, part of which they have already destroyed it was awe inspiring to see a big shell hit a building see it go up in a cloud of dust.We are having a strenuous time very little sleep while we are on the front line duty as the other Divisions only did 6 fighting days nights, I presume we will do likewise move back again, being relieved by the 4th DIV.It is terrible to see the horrors of which War has wrought here. All the people live in caves, built for them underground when the shelling starts they all run in off the streets.We are working the Tramway in Albert they try hard to smash it up.We had 2 horses blown to pieces last night, but fortunately the driver escaped.I was up all night receiving despatching transport had sufficient light most of the time from
