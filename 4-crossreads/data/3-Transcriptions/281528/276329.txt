<p>19/4/18 &ndash; Lavieville<br/>Awakened for stand to arms but, nothing transpiring, turned in for further sleep.  Got up about 10.30 and had a good hot bath which my man Charlesworth had prepared for me.  While we were lunching a couple of shells whizzed over and killed a couple just outside so the doctor had to leave.  Rodda called in and with him I walked over to his company.  There was a little sleety hail or snow falling and I was very glad that all the men had blankets.  A good many were fast asleep in their bivouacs</p>
