<p>Rest Camp. Southampton. Eng<br/>25th Aug. 15</p>
<p>Dear Mother.</p>
<p>We have arrived in England. Everyone tells us it is quite the best time of the year to see England, and without doubt everything is very green &amp; beautiful. I am charmed with it. Owing to having a few measle patients on board we have been Quarantined for 16 days in a Rest Camp at Southampton. But this will be cancelled  I think &amp; we expect a little leave. There are some 10 000 Tommies camped just near us, but so far we are not impressed, rather the opposite. The people here gave us a magnificent reception and, as we marched through the city everybody lined the streets, and down to the tiniest kiddies insisted on either touching or shaking our hands. We marched our best, and I think it was good too. It was a 5 mile march to the camp, the last 2 through groves, parks &amp; shrewd residences, absolutely charming. We landed our 300 wounded Englishmen at Davenport &amp; then trained to Southampton. We were 38 hours without a sleep &amp; working hard. In the channel we had an experience with a submarine but our patrol destroyers were on the scene like a flash. We passed over the spot where the Afrie was torpedoed. The water was littered with spars &amp; there were 2 upturned boats &amp; a few stiff bodies in the water. So altogether we were glad to glide between the pretty headlands of Plymouth. Everybody here thinks we are Canadians, &amp; a few have asked us whether we are New Zealanders, but Australians came third in their thoughts. I seem to be the only chap in the unit who has not brought money with him &amp; it does seem a pity not to see something now I am here. I will tap Mr. Harrison I think. Well, for awhile ta-ta. Best love.</p>
