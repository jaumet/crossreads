<p>have to wait another week before I can expect one. Last night I sent off another 15 films in registered letter.<br/>Had second lesson in French at the Burlitz last night.<br/>Drill here is not quite so monotonous now, we do not get quite so much by numbers, it is varied. It was my turn mess orderly to day.<br/>Coming back from the zoo last Sunday afternoon, I got out of tram to take a few views of the Nile. The Nile is a fine river a little wider than the Fitzroy, There are a good many strange craft on it. Dozen of quick sailing boats which have one sail, suspended from the top of a high mast, too a couple of good pictures of the river.<br/>Saturday Dec 18th 15.<br/>This afternoon I went to the Museum found it full of mummies, coffins &amp; ancient stuff of all descriptions, it was very interesting. Saw the mummy of Ramses II who lived about 1200 BC, also there is a fine collection of old jewellery.<br/>Am still at school</p>
