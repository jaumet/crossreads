<p>We stayed here the whole of the next day, Sept 27th 1917, in the evening Fritz put over a terrible raking artillery barrage. He was out for a counter attack!</p>
<p>Our S.O.S.s' were busy, our aeroplanes did good observance work and they correctly reported to our batteries. The Germans were hastily sending up their reinforcements in motor lorries, but our reply in the way of shell fire proved their masters.</p>
<p>We left these trenches about an hour after, we were soon forgetting our hardships, innumerable batteries a long way from the support lines were barking incessantly.</p>
<p>We reached a pt. near Hell Fire Corner, as it was named, half way to the ruined town of Ypres. The Y.M. had its usual consignment of hot cocoa &amp; biscuits ready for us It was very welcome too! Added with hot stew etc, it was a veritable bean feast!</p>
<p>Poor Tom Pritchard was killed that night near the Y.MCA dugout.</p>
