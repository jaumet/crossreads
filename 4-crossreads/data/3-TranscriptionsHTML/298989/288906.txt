<p>Anzac<br/>15/12/15<br/>tinned chicken sent up by A.S.C. who are clearing out stocks. After dark very heavy machine gun fire and bombing up on Russells Top. Before stand to, up the firing line talking to the men. They have rigged up notices. "TrenchesTo Let" "Abdul! Call again in Spring". All the lads as happy as Larry. A bright moonlight night, the hospital ships gay with lights close in. We are making some noises in front with rattling tins for Abdul's benefit. Gave Hogarth the tip to dispose of mess stuff. Peart asked for permission to have some shots &amp; unloosed 10. Made him clean and oil all my pouch ammunition and sharpen bayonets &amp;c. Extra A.M.C. men reported for duty. Men getting puttees, leggings &amp;c from Ordnance in large quantities. Our patrol saw a Turk within 10 yards of our trenches hidden from view, which shows necessity for conversation in undertones. Reported the other night one crept right up under cover of a steepish cliff and looked right over parapet. Seen by man who was a few yards away from his rifle. Sniping slack.</p>
<p>16/12/15<br/>Cloudy day no wind sea calm. Later a sunny day but cold in the shade. Four hospital ships in. Capt. Thomsen to hospital with mumps. Corpse out in front poisons the air, one putteed leg drawn up, quite like early days here. Chaplain embarks tonight. Posting strict guard on hillside tonight orders to shoot to kill on sight. Picked L Cpl Chalmers for the job as a steady determined man for Corporal of the Guard. Am to be the last out of our lines myself when the fun commences. Rather a tribute to the strain of war that we have had to call today for a return  for half-witted and "soft" men in order to get them out of the way so as to leave the remainder reliable. The "human machine gun" still flourishes but the voiceless bomb maniac is missing. A big gun (new) of ours slashed out suddenly at dusk and provoked a prompt reply of shells from Abdul most of which burst in the air</p>
