<p>of them had landed right into the entrance of this magazine &amp; started the shells there, exploding. The first report was, that 4 to 5 million pounds worth of shells were lost &amp; 2000 soldiers employed there, killed. Later news authentically given, showed that only a small lot of the smaller shells had been destroyed, all the heavier kind were saved, &amp; the casualties were very slight. This damage was never known to the Huns.</p>
<p>It was one of those "accidents" that occasionally occur when least expected. At any rate the Huns did not have the satisfaction of knowing that a Magazine had been hit, Presumably the aeroplane had simply tried to drop bombs on the Railway Station &amp; the town itself but a "lucky" shot, "got" the magazine which was dug under a field in the open away from both Railway Station &amp; town.</p>
<p>This detour delayed our arrival at the destination five hours, for instead of travelling in a straight line, (we could not pass close to where this magazine was) we had to travel on a different track which almost formed a loop.</p>
<p>At midnight on the Friday we arrived in Calais, and half an hours journey in a Red Cross car, brought us to our Hospital, a series of large tents arranged just like an ordinary Camp excepting that instead of the bell tents for the men in a camp they were all large marquees able to accommodate easily 20 to 30 beds.</p>
<p>This was the first time we had seen that women had been requisitioned to take the place of men, which became so common afterward. These motor cars were all in charge of young English girls who looked just as if their proper status was "On Tour" instead of "doing their bit" like a soldier. We afterwards learned that it was no uncommon thing for them to be sent on urgent calls right up to the first "Clearing Station"</p>
