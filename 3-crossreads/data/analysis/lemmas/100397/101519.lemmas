 Next week I may be abl to find Eric a Jim Elder . They are up with the Btn again I had a short note from Simmon I guess he will be surpris when he see me he receiv the vers Mother sent and in his note he ask me to thank her for him he has been veri lucki , has not had a scratch yet , but he must have had a hard time in the cold weather , in fact all who were in the trench must have suffer . had I been there in the winter I should have gone away with Trench feet for even now I feel the cold in my feet and hand . I wish we were a long way farther south then I might have a chanc to run down and see Sister Nell . She is at Les Andeli , and that is too far from this camp . if I get hit again I may be abl to go and see her . Last night I wrote to J. H 's letter came along with the rest , so I answer it straightaway . now the sun is shine but onli veri feebli so I am go outsid for awhil as it is veri cold in the tent . heap of love to all especi Mother and yourself from Chas
