December 1916

draining job near the camp. Whilst in this camp "A" Coy played "C" Coy football & "A" won by 8 points to 6. Our Major also return to the battalion & was made Lt. Colonel a few days later. On the 15th Dec we had to pack up & march to Meualte & and went into huts & was on fatigue loading & unloading trains. Our stay here however was short for on the 20th we again packed up & marched to huts in Melbourne camp Marmetz & stayed for the night. Next morning we moved off to Bernafay & again stayed overnight in huts. It was during the afternoon of the 22nd when we left Bernafay & my company went right into the firing line which consisted of outposts & I was put in charge of No 9 night post & had three men with me. It was a rather cold job for we went on post at dusk & stayed till dawn & was exposed to all weather & was a case of marking time the whole time to keep warm but we got a small rest of a day. All night long on the 23rd Fritz shelled the post & during the early hours of the next morning he made it that hot that I had to move the post. Our relief came on the night of the 24th when "D" Coy relieved us & we went back to supports. Supports were situated at Battalion H. Quarters & we were in a big tunnel but there was only sitting room. Our duties here we too carry rations
