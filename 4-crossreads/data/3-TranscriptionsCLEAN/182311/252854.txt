    Then away next morning, and back to France, learning just before leaving the English Coast, that the Messines battle had commenced and that 'twas a tremendous success.  We were all keen to be in it and felt somewhat chagrined at missing it, but reflected that anyhow, there will be plenty more fighting in the war yet. 
    I got no further than Divisional Head-quarters and they told me that they had wired to me to stop in London and that I must return forthwith to do a Staff Training Course at Tidworth, England, and so back I went to "Blighty" and am installed here doing preparatory staff work, what it will lead to I don't know, possibly a job as Assistant Staff Captain, and eventually perhaps Staff Captain, but even if nothing of that sort comes along, I'll be every bit as efficient, and more so, than a Regimental Officer. 
    Well, that's all for the present, 
      With best wishes from 
   
          Harold.
