<p>1.3.16<br/>Left Tel-el-Kebir and entrained for Serapeum where we arrived same day, very nice sand felt deep and very fine it was great marching with full pack up .<br/>Crossed the canal at dinner time and got to the camp about 3 Pm. The worst hole Ive struck yet, sand and nothing but sand and when aided by a night wind it's the worst torture out fills up everything this lasted for three days</p>
