course they get plenty firing to keep them amused:  poor beggars they will get it in the neck in a day or two:  one does exactly as one's told, but feels a sort of sneaking relief when the other fellow gets told to come and relieve you.
I got the photograph of Sing holding Tom III, also one of Graham who grows every time I see him.
I must make an effort in future to write you more amusing or more interesting letters:  this one is the first for a fortnight, and a pretty poor effort at that.
Goodbye & cheer ho! best love to old John & Graham & to you.  Keep well & fit, and don't let the Australian workers union ruin us all:  of course the taxes will do that, though:  we shall all be paupers & have you thought out what you will do for a living:  you must practice sewing, I think & cooking.
Goodbye againJock C. Ellis
