10/8/19 Durban
The Orsova came in early with women and families and anchored in the stream. At 10.15 with the Captain (Young), Padre Fox, Dr Marshall Gorman Hayes took rickshaws to the Emmanuel R.C. Cathedral and we were admitted with the Mayor of Durban to the Bishop's House. There were many priests robbing. We all passed into the church to the seats of honour reserved for us. Not a very large cathedral, new and plain. Pontifical High Mass in honour of the Jubilee of the Bishop of Natal was celebrated. The music was Gounod's Messe Solonelle. The Bishop of Port Elizabeth was the preacher. It was a rarely good service and the fine music rich vestments added to its sensuous appeal. Reached the ship about 1.30 for lunch. Close to the docks is a whaling station.
