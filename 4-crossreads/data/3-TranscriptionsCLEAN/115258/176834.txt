My dear Mother,
here it is Easter Sunday so I'll start a letter home, but dont suppose I'll be able to post it till we get relieved from here, as we are still out east of the Jordan and I am writing this on a signal station on a hill with the river running away below me and far away in west one can just see the top of the Mount of Olives. I suppose you will have read in the papers of all our doings over this side - on account of all the work we have been doing lately, we did not take part in the big stunt our horses needed a spell, so we have been on keeping lines of communications open. Have had a fairly strenuou job but not too bad on the whole. We have just had a big issue of canteen stuffs sent out to us including butter, chocolate, fish etc, so everything in the garden is very lovely to day.
