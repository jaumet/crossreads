 six weeks I've had four letters, 1 from Jim, 1 from a little niece &amp; one from you &amp; one from Mother.  Wouldn't it make you feel hopeless.  I'm not blaming you as I know you write but don't jump on me when you write.  Poor old Isabel I wonder what she'll do.  I only wrote to Jim the day before yesterday &amp; he would be dead then. 
 Glad the season is being fair, I've been wondering about it &amp; the paper said there had been rain.  I wonder if the book came home to London &amp; who is publishing it.  I'm dying to read it.  Did I tell you I was trying to get to Paris next month but I don't care a damn now &amp; must try &amp; arrange to get out of this place &amp; into something more settled &amp; civilised for the winter.  I don't feel I could stand another winter like the last. 
 Thanks for the Cook's application which really was rather a pearl. 
 I'm sorry to hear Tom E. is playing up.  It is rotten for Mrs. Kathryn &amp; like you I hope Jock will return before long &amp; sort things out. 
 The Hay races must have been jolly.
