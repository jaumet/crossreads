<p>THURSDAY, AUGUST 21, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine with cold SW wind blowing.</p>
<p>I lopped in 4D then went round</p>
<p>all the paddocks. Met Linda at 4D</p>
<p>mill and we started burning off</p>
<p>in Middle paddock</p>
<p>Tickle finished poisoning in Top</p>
<p>paddock and started Middle.</p>
<p>Alan came out in big car &amp; brought</p>
<p>My&eacute;e,&nbsp;Maisie and Jack Charley</p>
<p>with him.</p>
