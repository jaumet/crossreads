<p>The Kiosks covered with French Papers are just a scream.  The pastry cook shops make our <strike>pastry</strike> cakes taste like piffle.  You couldn't believe there was a war on here.</p>
<p>Any day now and I'll know all about it.  There'll be a draft.  Then "up the line with the best of luck".  Two of France's largest seaports, an inland town a week at a leading and "fashionable" seaside resort, a train trip through the most wonderfully green and rich country you could imagine for a day and night have formed part of the program during the past five weeks.  French I speak far better than English.  No groping for words <strike>to</strike> that can't be found to express what you feel.  Here you're understood in a flash.  I posted you a tip top description (badly illustrated) "Paris by Night" (after the style of London by Night that we read in Vancouver).  Should you have not received it Promise.  Buy it right away.  It's "good-oh".  Dear one I've got to dash off to a Sergt. Major's tent.  For the past two weeks I'm his interpreter.</p>
