<p>L.H.F.A.</p>
<p>Twas on a bright January day<br/>The Good ship Wandilla sailed away<br/>From Pinkenba that place that smells<br/>Away they went to the Dardanelles<br/>The last of the 14th L.H.F.A.</p>
<p>A little band of 8 were they<br/>With a motto of P.O. each day<br/>And a happy day it will be<br/>When they reach the shore of Gallipoli</p>
<p>The last of the 14th 2nd L.H.F.A.<br/>A soft spot they had for their officers fine<br/>As well as for comrades left behind in the line<br/>And respect they are held by each of the 8<br/>Will be stronger than even when they reach Berlin 'Gates"<br/>By the last of the 14th L.H.F.A.</p>
<p>Left home for Alarayt</p>
