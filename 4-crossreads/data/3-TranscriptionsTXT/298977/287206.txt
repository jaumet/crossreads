My dear Mother,
As you will see by the address we are now off the Peninsular (you have probably read by this of the very successful evacuation), and am pleased to say that we were able to spend our Xmas in peace.  The 19th Billies have not yet come to hand, but we got an issue of a Billy per man on Boxing Day, contents of which were very useful.  I believe our own billies will be issued at our next destination, though we don't know for certain where that will be, or when we are going to leave here.  This is a pretty desolate sort of place, with a few native villages, and is used as an Army Base for all Mediterranean Operations.
My arm is quite O.K. again now, though I was forced to travel very light from the Peninsular.
Have not received a mail for a long time now, and don't expect we will get one here, unless we are to stay here longer than we think.  However there ought to be a big one when it does come to hand.  Received a parcel from you a couple of days ago, and it was very acceptable.
It seems very funny having to sleep in tents again and it is hard to get accustomed to the quietness.  We miss the noise of the trenches.
Have had a little over a week away from things now but most of us are beginning to wish for "something doing" again.
Hope all are well at home.  Will write a longer letter as soon as the Censorship is a little less strict.
Love,fromRoy.
