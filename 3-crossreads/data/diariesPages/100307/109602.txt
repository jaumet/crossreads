Mametz Bapaume
3/4/17
used to creep so warily at night when the firing line was just in front. Noticed a couple of our sausage balloons up as we got near Bapaume and suddenly a hawklike Taube appeared out the blue and pounced on one. It burst into flames and came down in a trail of fire and smoke. Its occupants could not have lived Meantime a second was being hauled down fast and the German missed his first go. The occupants jumped out in parachutes and the balloon was getting quite low to the winch when the Hun very pluckily returned dodging the shells and brought it down too. He then sailed over Bapaume and got another.
Entered the town and soon find the Canadian Railway Battn and got all particulars re our job. Saw Town Major and got a billet in a cellar on lousy straw on boards. 
A transport driver for a room mate ? sent the other back with a message to Mametz. 
Soldiering lands in some odd places. Already before going to sleep I feel itchy all over ? God knows how I shall fill in the morning.
