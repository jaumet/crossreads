<p>JUNE &nbsp; SATURDAY 17 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Another cow of a day. Bitterly cold and a fair swell which made the old ship roll a treat. A lot of the men sick. We could see the rest of our convoy away ahead, we lost three or four miles at night but gained it again at night. Had a buzzerr lecture in morning and we amused ourselves as best we could in the afternoon. Most of us were looking for a warm place.</p>
