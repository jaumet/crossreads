27/1/18 Londondark. Round here is a great soldiers centre. Went up to Piccadilly by tube - the London tube is far worse than London [sic] and to get anywhere here it is necessary to change and go by indirect routes. The Strand was thronged with its usual crowd parading up and down in the dark. Met Cawthorne in the lounge at Simpsons and stood him dinner there. It was an off night and there were not many people there. We got an indifferent dinner at 10/- each and I was disgusted with the whole thing. Then adjoined to the Strand Palace on the opposite side of the Strand and we found ourselves in a place like the Regent Palace. Crowds of people sitting round. Girls (some with their hair down) sitting round smoking and giggling. A great amount of gladeye. Left Cawthorne about 9.30 and went back to hotel and to bed very tired.
