<p>Oct 26th [1916] At 1.30 PM. we departed (that is the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron) to sea with five attendant destroyers to patrol the North Sea as far as Flamborough Head [On the Yorkshire coast]<br/>Oct 27th  At 7.30 am. we returned to our usual anchorage, after which we coaled ship.</p>
<p>Oct 31st  We again coaled ship, (as no ship of war was allowed to be short of coal in harbour more than 10&percnt; in case of emergency) after which at 4.30 PM we again proceeded to sea, but this time in company with  the Grand Fleet</p>
<p>Nov 1st  At daybreak we were able to witness for the first time the Great Fleet at sea at least as much as we could see of it</p>
