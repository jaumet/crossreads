thing & one has to be very careful.  I have not heard from him for months now.  I had a nice letter from J.C-'s friend & he asked if I had heard from him.  He has not heard & he wrote to him everso many times.  Funny isn't it.  Dont mention this to any-one.
I've not heard of him nor inquired about him since last February.
Had a P.C. from Jess Marsh, a nice letter from Mrs Balfour & a long letter from Bessie
