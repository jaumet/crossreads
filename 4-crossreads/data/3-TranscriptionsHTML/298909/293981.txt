<p>about 2 miles away across the sand, here we found 5 poor devils suffering from Sunstroke &amp; effects of the heat, they were all unconscious &ndash; We done what we could to give them relief &amp; brought them in two sand carts &ndash; We were just about done up ourselves &ndash; a fellow must do a job like this across the sand to really understand what a hard lot a stretcher bearers lot is. About 6.30 pm I took sick &amp; had an awful night &ndash; had got a touch of the sun &ndash; I nearly went mad, was vomiting blood.</p>
<p>18/5/16  Thursday</p>
<p>A lot cooler &ndash; I felt very weak &ndash; Drilling till 9 am &ndash; Then went for a swim &ndash; The Tent next to us are always arguing with each other &ndash; they got into holts to day &amp; one fellow had two stiches put in his eye &amp; another was out for a long time, having been hit with a tent mallet &ndash; Charley Chaplin knock out was not in it.</p>
