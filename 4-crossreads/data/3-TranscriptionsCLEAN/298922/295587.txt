 TARANTO  Still flying "Yellow Flag" - one will be like ENOCH ARDEN ere England is reached.  
 Alongside an ITALIAN Battleship is practising with her big guns - shaking us from stem to stern - a dirigible Balloon spotting for the guns, flies overhead. This is a wonderful harbour the opening no more than a street wide with many storied houses built to waters edge, & the shipping is hidden by the Houses. The days drag on & I'm very hungry to get on our journey.  Post this ITALY.
