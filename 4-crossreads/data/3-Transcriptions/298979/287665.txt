<p>not appear very promising, also as the weather conditions looked very threatening the Sentry decided to go to the office &amp; make inquiry about improving his prospect.</p>
<p>On arriving there a group of Men of War sailors who, from their conversation had just come on furlough after a spell of work in the "North Sea", and as all those that could were paying for first class fares across, this "clinched" the matter for the Sentry. If sailors, ABs, from the North Sea were paying Saloon fares, it certainly looked as if the trip was likely to prove pretty "lively". The Sentry succeeded in obtaining a berth alongside two of the AB's, on the transom of the vessel &amp; in conversation stated, that their decision "fixed" his.</p>
<p>The decision was justified. The steamer was tossed about in such a way that one moment she appeared to be trying to stand straight up on her head or stern, &amp; the next would make such a mighty roll, as if making a maddened effort to roll right over.</p>
<p>When morning dawned the condition of those who had been forced to remain on deck or who had been crowded in the forecastle or steerage forward, was seen to be indeed pitiable. Not having had a "wink" of sleep, clothing wet through to the skin, &amp; with the risk of being pitched or washed overboard at every big roll. It had been a very "dirty" night one of the worst experienced.</p>
<p>The difference in fares spent by the Sentry was not wasted under such circumstances, besides the pleasure of being able to sit down to a good supper &amp; an appetising breakfast in luxurious comfort warranted it, even if seasoned with the exceptionally surprised looks of 4 or 5 Officers evidently hurt, at the audacity of a private to sit at the same table, although to his honor, the Tommy Major in Glasgow rather attracted than repelled</p>
