<p>we talked of the doings of the 1st day ashore &amp; of the incidents of the great charge etc.</p>
<p>All of the battle was once more fought all over again. Returned to the Engineers Store where I slept for the night. Olly made me up a bunk on a stretcher in a shed &amp; I was very comfortable indeed. Olly being like a mother even to me even dosing my blankets with powder for fleas.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2nd Nov 1915<br/>Woke up very refreshed. The shed in which I slept was right on the beach &amp; the roll of the waves on the shore was very sweet music. I was to go along to the landing stage to see if the ship was leaving</p>
