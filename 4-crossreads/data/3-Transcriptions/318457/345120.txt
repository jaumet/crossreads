<p>[2- 12 October 1914]</p>
<p>day word had come through that the Germans were in Tahiti. It is just now uncertain what we will do.</p>
<p>On Sat. 3rd Oct. sailed from Rabaul for Suva &ndash; Flag, Montcalm and Sydney, the Encounter and others to foll. next day.</p>
<p>Voyage was on a whole a rough one. Except first day out, strong S.E to mod. blowing &ndash; so rough on 7th 8th 9th when there was a good deal of pitching and some rolling. On Sat 10th we were under shelter of Fiji group through many miles to N.W. This broke force of sea a great deal. But on Sunday we had the same wind as before with much larger sea with same effects. At 4pm took 8 point turn which brought sea nearly on beam with result violent rolling up to 20 deg. &ndash; rather lively for two or three hours. Our course lay round north of Group and then coasting, 10 miles off sight round E and S.E. thence to Suva.</p>
<p>Flag appeared to have very slight  motion, Montcalm very lively especially at pitching. A very dreary monotonous voyage.</p>
<p>Suva was reached at about 2pm Monday 12th Oct. Next day a signal stated that leave was allowed to officers in afternoon up to 6pm in case of ships not keeping</p>
