<p>stuff coming over a little further up the road.</p>
<p>Friday 8.3.18   Elson visited me today and I returned with him to the Battalion I seen a lot of old faces &amp; received quite a welcome. Fellows who have been away in Blighty a year &amp; upwards were there. There has evidently been a spring cleaning in Blighty &amp; the company shows its effects about 240 strong. On returning to the Dump tonight I heard that 40 had been notified to pack up &amp; rejoin their units in the morning. It would have been an awful "Gutser" if I had been notified. My Paris leave would have been "Napoo" then. Another lot are going Soon, on Sunday I believe so perhaps I am talking too soon.</p>
<p>I have been hearing some risque stories about Paris. One about a certain Hunting incident which I thought was a rather funny story, once, I now find to be an actual every night occurrence at the Wassa. At this place French Soldiers  have unusual privileges secured to them by a paternal Government. A guide &amp; 60 Francs makes one monarch of all he surveys at the Wassa between 8.0P.M and 6.00A.M. McLennan told me that last time the 1st were in, they &amp; the Germans were rather flooded out so they both got above ground to bale out their trenches, this mutual arrangement led up to a meeting in no mans land, this   <strike>in</strike> being observed led to the Australians</p>
