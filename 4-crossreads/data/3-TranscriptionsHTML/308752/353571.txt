<p>a collecting station is formed. Cars convey the wounded from this point to the rear. Here we await orders before moving on, so the majority of us obtained a good rest, &amp; 'believe me' we appreciated it. Now &amp; again Fritz became a little angry, &amp; kept everyone on the alert. Enjoyed a couple of hours snooze in a shell hole, but was rudely awakened by the noise of machine-guns. An air duel was taking place, an imposing sight. The taube, however, manage to get away. About 11 a.m. five squads of A section receive orders to move on. After walking about half a mile we crossed a gully in which were nine German guns. The ground here was just one mass of shell holes, our shell fire in this vicinity must have been terrific. Continuing on through another village we passed an A.D.S. &amp; from all appearances the work seemed to be going along smoothly here. Along the side of the road I noticed a considerable amount of ammunition that Fritz had left behind. Not far from the village some more guns, &amp; a couple of lorries were passed.</p>
