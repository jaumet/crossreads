<p>20:  Orders to move off at 4 p.m. for Arish.  We buried goods we had bought at Mazar, as we could not carry them on our ponies, being well loaded with personal gear &amp; horse feed.  Rode all night through very heavy sand.</p>
<p>21:  Reached Wadi Arish at 4 a.m. &amp; much to our surprise, rode into the town without a shot being fired, our planes reporting that they were at Magdhaba.  Filthy mud villages, donkeys, people &amp; fowls under the one roof.  Turks had taken everything possible out of the place &amp; women were brutally treated before they left the place.  Had a swim during the afternoon in the Med. Sea, where Shepherd &amp; Struthers of 1st regt. were killed through a mine exploding on the beach.  Within 7 hours of reaching here, the boats were landing stores at an improvised pier which was erected by the Aust naval bridging team.  57 Bedouins brought in by our patrols.</p>
<p>22:  Saddled up at 6 p.m., but kept in wadi till midnight waiting for ration convoy to arrive, not leaving until the 23rd at 1.15 a.m. doing 20 miles without a spell reaching Magdhaba at 4.30 a.m.</p>
