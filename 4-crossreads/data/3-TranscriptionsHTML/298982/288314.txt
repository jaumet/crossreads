<p>it look quite an inferno.</p>
<p>Wed 30th We had to stand to arms at 1 am. As only just got to sleep was wild as we most were.</p>
<p>(The aeroplane which dropped the papers on Sunday night asked us Austns to come over to them &amp; we would be well fed etc &amp; were only mercenaries.)</p>
<p>Five dead in morgue one of them a Turk. Said to have been the Ottoman Guard who attacked on left. Drunk or partially. 250 left dead or badly wounded in front of the trenches.</p>
<p>We went into trenches in morn. Rotten trenches, shallow narrow &amp; enfiladed on both sides. No possie supports Heavy thunder storm at night &amp; some rain not too pleasant. Some firing at night. No rum just when needed</p>
