<p>&amp;the men have enjoyed the more open fighting immensely after the drudgery of the mud &amp; trench life, they put up very fine performances in taking a <strike>very</strike> large area of country &amp; in some <strike>very</strike> stiff scraps very much more than holding their own.  I wish I could give you some idea of what the country is like between Albert &amp; Bapaume where the advance was made in the Somme battle, the country is indescribable, the whole ground pock marked by the shells.  What were once flourishing villages are now but irregular heaps of masonry, not a tree has escaped but what all one sees are battered stumps to mark where they were.  Some villages such as Pozieres, Longueval, Guedecourt [Gueudecourt] are absolutely unrecognisable as such not a wall or a stone standing, till seen one cannot quite picture it</p>
