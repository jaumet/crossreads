 There are two seats one in front of the other, &amp; of course the machine is dual-controlled, so that in the case of the pilot being hit the observer can carry on- provided he knows his work.  Well the pilot took the back seat &amp; I the front, &amp; strapped myself in with the joy-stick between my knees &amp; a dozen different levers &amp; throttles on either side.  Right in front of me were 4 gauge glasses.  One the  "counter-revolutions"  "revolution-counter" indicates the speed of the propellor in hundreds of revolutions per minute.  Then there is the alti-mometer or instrument for recording the height in thousands of feet; then there is the speedometer recording the miles. per. hr. &amp; the pressure gauge for the oil feed.  When the mechanic started the propellor up the  counter-rev  rev: counter sprang to 400.  The pilot kept it at this to warm the engine up a little &amp; then gradually increased it to 800.  Then the chocks were pulled away from the wheels &amp; we moved off slowly over the uneven ground.  It takes 800 to move the machine on the ground, &amp; when we got right down to the end of the paddock we turned about &amp; faced the wind.  After a final test to see that all controls were working properly, the pilot opened the throttle &amp; off we started   He opened it until the rev: counter registered 1800.  Away we went over the ground the hand of the speedometer swinging quickly through 20, 30, &amp; 40, until at 50 mph we left Mother Earth.  It was a very peculiar sensation to see the ground slipping away from you, &amp; to feel yourself
