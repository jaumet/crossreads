Dear Grace
I received your very welcome letter to day which you wrote Aug 23rd-15   &amp;  was very pleased to hear from you all   &amp;  sorry to hear poor old Da was not doing well it seems very hard for him tell him I was asking about him  &amp;  I will be back again to see him some day I hope
I had a letter from Rachel &ndash; home   &amp; one from Edmunds to day I was glad you told me Mah was getting my money she never mentioned it in either the two letters I got from her I suppose she told me all about it in one that would go astray she said she wrote three or four.
Well Grace you were saying
