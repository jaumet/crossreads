<p>Saturday 6 February 1915</p>
<p>The Colonel, this morning, appeared on parade for the first time since we have been in Egypt.  After the morning parade, the battalion was assembled, and he spoke a few words to the men.  We must congratulate ourselves, he said, on our safe arrival at our destination, and that without the death of a single man in the batallion.  He reminded us that we were in a strange country, close to a city totally unknown to us. He advised us to look after ourselves, and not to run the risk of being sent back to Australia, diseased and disgraced.  "Be careful of yourselves", the old man concluded, "both for your own sakes, and for the sake of the good reputation that the 13th Battalion has already won for itself".</p>
<p>As a recognition of the good work put in by the men since disembarkation, a half holiday was granted by the Brigadier.  It was not as greatly appreciated as it might have been as most of the men are fairly "broke".  But the majority of the men were out of camp, the remainder staying behind to enjoy the first really decent clean up since they have been here.</p>
