<p>Selborne Chambers 174 Phillip Street 28 5113<br/>9th June, 1965.<br/>The Honourable K.A. Ferguson, 4 Drumalbyn Road, Bellevue Hill. N.S.W.<br/>Dear Judge, I would like to express my thanks for the patience and courtesy extended to me over the period I appeared before you. It was always a pleasure to conduct a case in your Court with its atmosphere of peace and judicial calm. All my clients (whether successful or not) felt that they received a fair hearing and that their causes were presented fully, though impartially. Your assistance in the interposing of medical witnesses was of great convenience to the doctors concerned and to Counsel. The co-operation of your Associate and Tip-staff including the preparation of a sumptuous morning-tea will also be missed. I think that the main thing I will remember about your Court was the absence of any acrimony or ill feeling between the Bench and Bar or among the Bar. if all Judges were like yourself, one would be less inclined to oppose the abolition of juries. I do wish you every success in the future in your well earned retirement.<br/>Yours faithfully, Clive Evatt jnr</p>
