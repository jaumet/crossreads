<p>Easter Tuesday 10 April 1917</p>
<p>We passed the Boundary Stones of Syria I mentioned in January &amp; took some photos. Pen is bad. I am trying to write HOME. Our TRANSPORT went along the Beach, but we went direct &amp; are now about 50 miles from the DEAD SEA. Murgha Mack has gone to Hospital with a growth on his tongue thought to be Cancer.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph is crossed through.]  On my way to the troughs I met a L.H. man, by my beside his horse. I thought he was sick, but he replied "I'm alright" he was drunk. When I asked him where he wanted to go he replied "To the firing line Kura - "Crusader". No idea where he got the tanglefoot from.</p>
<p>It was just here that SAMSON was supposed to be Killed, the Old Testament speaks a lot about this part of the world.</p>
