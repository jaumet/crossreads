A nice grey car has just passed containing two Officers.Very nice to be an Officer, eh?Did you hear that Betty Waldron has a little daughter - & has named it "COO-EE WINSOME" ?Is not that Ghastly?Have not heard from Nell Sherwin for some time - but got some Sydney Mails she was so good as to send.No more news. Very much love fromEver your loving BrotherFred
