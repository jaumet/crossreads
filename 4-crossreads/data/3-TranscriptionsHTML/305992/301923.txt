<p>After altering our courses the stranger was now nearly astern &amp; gaining on us. darkness came &amp; he was about 4 miles off. We increased our speed &amp; called the firemen who were off duty &amp; put a double lot at the furnesses. Our speed in a matter of 15 minutes increased to 17 Knots &amp; then to 18 Knots about 20 miles an hour. Revolutions on both engins 92. The troopship vibrating &amp; going for all she was worth. We soon lost sight of him &amp; continued at that speed during the night. All troops on deck with probably 500 glasses straining there eyes to see if they could see anything.<br/>After at daybreak not a thing visable. We sent a wireless out &amp; sent word of this stranger's movements. We found out after as we had suspected that she was a raider. She was sighted &amp; sunk by gunfire by one of the English auxilary cruisers. We all thanked God for the speed we had otherwise we would have been a easy prey for him. We proved the above statement re the raider from the Naval Authorities at Port Said.<br/>Nothing of importance happened until we got of the Island of Perim . We were chalanged by a British Patrol cruiser Sent an officer on board satisfied we were all right &amp; steamed again up the Red Sea towards Suez. We had a splendid trip up the Red Sea</p>
