<p>Sunday 9.1.16 (18)<br/>I dodged Church Parade this morning. We had to don Breeches &amp; Leggings &amp; it is a terrible strain after a week without socks &amp; in shorts all the time. I tried to write letters this afternoon but half-wrote 2 &amp; gave it up.</p>
<p>We had a sacred concert on the Prom deck from 8 till 9. Dave Niness &amp; I got right down the back with our nurse girls &amp; we had chocolate &amp; almond rock &amp; plenty of talk &amp; fun &amp; of course did not hear a bit of the concert.</p>
<p>Last night it rained again but I found a dry spot. Ellis slept on deck too.</p>
