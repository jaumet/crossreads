Our Boys in the front line are actually fighting in shell holes they can't stand sit or sleep.  All attack have to be made at a walk &amp; I believe the second or third lines attack before the first.  In the solid chalk of the trenches live numbers of fat frogs how they get food or water God knows.  I was much interested by the struggles of one to climb over my Rubber sheet  the sheet was on an incline &amp; Mr Frog could do nothing with it &amp; he was in a Hurry too because I was touching him up behind.   Our fellows all wear tin sheets at the back of their neck so that the Artillery shall know them.  The 2nd Batt. and the Engineers both refused the job our fellows done last night.  The trench in no mans land.
Thursday 3-8-16Nos 3 &amp; 4 Platoon went out last night to dig out a sap but the fire was too hot, so we (No 2) had to take it on this morning.  The Cap. told us 2 other companies had been practically blown out of it but that it had  to be done.  We found it a collection of shell holes &amp; dug it out to within about 200 yds of the firing line before handing it over to the next relief.  We got plenty of Shrap. &amp; H.E. from Fritz.
