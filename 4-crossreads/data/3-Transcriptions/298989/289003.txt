<p>Sinai<br/>7/3/16<br/>with cries of "Moya". They all bucked in &amp; cracked great jokes all the time. Every time they picked up their packs after a rest they made the groaning complaint a camel does when rising under its load, or yelled to each other "She's a beauty, feel her weight". One chap said his brother had a pigeon and sent it from his home right up to Queensland. It flew right back twice so when they caught it they cut its wings and sent it off to Queensland again. The bird disappeared &amp; when they caught it again <strike>they</strike> it had corns on its feet with walking!</p>
<p>While we were still about 10 miles out and in blazing heat a flock of sparrows flew overhead towards the Canal. Yesterday I saw 2 crows right out in the desert. One chap said "A bloke I know has got a good job at Koroit" "What is it" said another private"<br/>"Lifting cow dung with a crowbar"! said No. 1<br/>"Aw! That's nothing", replied the second "Bill &amp; I have gotter better".<br/>"What's that".<br/>"Oh! Bagging up the seagulls at Alexandria".</p>
<p>The heat was cruel and the sweat soaked right through the mens tunics and into their packs. The chief topic of discussion was beer in all its phases and all determined on a good blow out. The other longing all expressed was for a dip in the Canal. Still plodding on we got close to Staging Camp, the band now &amp; then playing &amp; making a wonderful difference. Marched the last mile at attention the fellows going along with a great swing and marching splendidly. Passed several N.Z. regiments swinging along in the other direction. Formed double mass on a clear piece of desert near other units and went into bivouac. The QM had a splendid tea ready for the men and there were lollies, fish &amp; biscuits, "backsheese".</p>
<p>I write this lying on my belly on the sand at 2130 a candle flickering shielded by a pack &amp; water bottle. Sleeping men lie all around.</p>
