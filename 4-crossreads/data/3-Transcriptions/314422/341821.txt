<p>Sunday Dec 30 1917</p>
<p>1245 Very cold all day. There was the usual half holiday today. But it was so cold I did not go away from the camp. We have a good hut to sleep in, a [indecipherable] hut &ndash; but it is rather far away from the stables. The Sgt. Corporals and a few privates sleep in it. I am one of them. This hut has a corporal of the A.M.C. in another division in it with a stock of medicines and it is used as a dispensary. The others sleep in a barn which is very cold and draughty &ndash;</p>
<p>Monday Dec 31 1917 1246<br/>New Years Eve<br/>Reveille 6.a.m. We got word late last night that the Battalion was shifting to Neuve Eglise &amp; the transport</p>
