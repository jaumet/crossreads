<p>Friday 7 January, 1916</p>
<p>The wind &amp; rain&nbsp;continues, the sea is getting very rough &amp; it is nearly impossible to stand on deck. Most of the chaps are seasick, I am not feeling too happy myself but I am not at all ill.</p>
<p>It is becoming a juggling trick to eat your meals nowadays, you dare not take your hand off your plate for a moment &amp; have to eat with the other.</p>
<p>It has been raining on &amp; off all the morning but after dinner the wind went down &amp; the sun showed up a bit though the sea is still rough.</p>
