<p>Martin Woods and capture about three miles of ground. I will endeavour to give the main features of this attack as it was the last my unit took part in.<br/>St Martin Woods<br/>Previous to this "stunt" while bivouaccing in an old orchard at Corbie the platoons of each Company were supplied with areal photogtaphs of the Woods and the section of ground over which they would have to advance. Each man studied them; the machine gun nests and the spot that was to be the final objective where we were to halt and dif in Platoon in attack was illustrated, and a tank demonstration was given so that each man knew exactly what he was wxpected to do, and the signal that would be given to any Tank in case of troublesome "nest" being located. On the morning of the twenty third about two o'clock in the morning the different platoons of each Coy, started to move up from the reserve trench towards the front line. They did not move in file, but in line of artillery formation, that is: divided into small groups or sections of waves each group a few yards distance from the other and abreast of it. The Lewis gun crews advanced on the flanks of their platoon. In between them came the Riflemen Bombers Grenadiers (rifle) sections, each section being sub-divided and led by its own N.C.O. This organisation of platoons in attack I consider to be the most successful; method used by the Australians in active fighting, and there cab be no doubt that the casualties were much lighter with us through its use</p>
