<p>Act 4 Scene 2<br/><u>Sunday 22nd April</u></p>
<p>Am attached to 16th Field Ambulance at Wareham.<br/>During isolation I came to the conclusion that it would be useless to try to get back to the 3rd, for even if I did it would be only to go stretcher-bearing.<br/>I therefore made application to be sent here as N.C.O., but although I repeated the application no reply was vouchsafed.<br/>Tried to get paraded to A.D.M.S. when he reviewed us on the day before the King's Review, but Craig, the W.O. refused, so I waited till after we had returned</p>
