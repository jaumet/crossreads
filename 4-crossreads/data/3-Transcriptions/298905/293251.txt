<p>German lines, &amp; to make the scene more weird the Germans were shooting hundreds of large bright flares which lit the ground up between the trenches &amp; made them bright as day.<br/>Looking over the parapet (for you were quite safe for nothing was coming back) you could scarcely see the German trenches for smoke, dust, &amp; flying rubbish, but every now &amp; again 2 or 3 of our big shells would land all in a heap &amp; the combined flash from these shells showed us the havoc wrought in the sausage eaters trenches, everywhere there were huge gaps tore in the barricades &amp; in places they were levelled to the ground, if they didnt lose a few hundred men last night I will eat my hat willingly.<br/>The smoke &amp; fumes that came back</p>
