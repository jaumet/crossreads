 Tuesday, 27 July, 1915 The boat is becoming quite smart with her white hull &amp; green stripe &amp; red cross.  On fatigue all morning on wharf getting Red Cross stuff for our next trip.  Paid the balance of our money due to us, in a game of poker to-day I had remarkable luck as I was paid three royalties for four of a kind, headed by 4 aces.  Went ashore and had a great time but I am becoming just a wee bit too popular, I have made a lot of friends her mostly of the fair sex and I cannot afford to live up to my invitations.  Strange to say but nearly all my lady friends are French mostly married but with these I have become a bit of a social success. 
 Wednesday, 28 July, 1915 Still anchored in harbour whilst ship is being painted I lost all my money at poker to-day so had to remain on board, I have a heavy cold on me and it knocks me up. 
 One wants a lot of money to live up to Alexandria especially if he has lady friends and a soldier usually has two good days those succeeding pay day after that he has to growl &amp; curse &amp; wait for the next pay day. 
 It seems as if Rumania will soon be with us from what I hear from a friend who comes from there.
