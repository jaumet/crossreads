[26th Jan. contd]Kaisers birthday)I was astounded however at about 8.45 when word came for me to report to the Baths tonight.  I only had 5 minutes to pack up as motor was waiting but soon collected my goods & was on journey in no time.  The roads were simply packed with troops.  Only took me as far as M.D.S. so had a very cold time to Baths.  It was also against orders to walk about alone.  Arrived in due course and found that most of our boys had been transferred elsewhere  that 50 P B men (5th Div) were taking over & that Sergt Williams was to report to A.D.S.  Hence I was to relieve him.  Slept well.
Saturday 27th Not Kaisers birthday.  Not very much doing.  Soon got into running at Baths.  Quite a rest.  At night Sergt Williams pushed off.
Sunday 28thRecd letters from Aust.  Bath & shave and walk to Nieppe.  Still very cold.  One day last week it was only 7 degrees (25 below freezing)  Everything is frozen that is liquid & roads very slippery.
