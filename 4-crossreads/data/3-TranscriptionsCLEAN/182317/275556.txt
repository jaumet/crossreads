15 Barana parade, Roseville Chase N.S.W. 7th June 1865The HonourableMr Justice K.A. Ferguson.,4 Drumalbyn Rd., Bellevue HillDear Sir, Saturday's Herald told of your retirement from the bench and I want to thank you for serving the community so well and I wish you an enjoyable retirement for many years to come.In early 1916 you were responsible for determining the course I took in the A.I.F. You picked me out with others to go to the showground for training. I joined the (A.I.F.) 17th Bn & came under the Command of H.T. Blue Allan for practically the remainder of the War. Then again you were in charge of the draft I was in from England to France. Blue Allan is now running a "Shell" Service Station at Meullaway near Coffs Harbour on the Pacific Highway, I visited him about 12 months ago & have heard from him since. He is keeping well. The gas Service Station is really just something to occupy his time.
