  
 Neutrals 
 When the job seems rough & risky And you've got no rum or whisky Keep on smilin', smilin' smilin' Till you're like a currant Bun And the Huns they nearly shell yer' Bloomin Taubes they try & fell yer Keep on smilin', smilin, smilin Till you're like a bullocks yoke Cause the Huns they know were martyrs Not real soldiers only carters Bad the 'uns they show real pity for the purely neutral Bloke
