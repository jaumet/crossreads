  
 I must also thank you all very, very much for your Xmas Hamper that you have ordered It hasn't yet come to hand but I hope that it won't go astray like last years did.  It is awfully good of you dear people, & really I am most grateful to you. Must close now, with love to you all at home, Ever your loving, Leo.
