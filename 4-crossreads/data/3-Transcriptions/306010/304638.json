<p>beach a large number of bathing boxes &amp; machines are being used to accommodate patients and I'm sure they "wouldn't leave their little wooden huts for anyone".<br/>Sund 23rd July (10pm) :-<br/>Yesterday evening I went for a walk over to Wimille 1&frac12;  kilom&egrave;tres from Wimereux railway station &amp; a very pretty walk too along a narrow white road bordered by green fields &amp; rural cottages, past pretty meadows, over a bridge, along a fine avenue  flanked by tall trees into the quiet village. Here I bought some postcards of Wimille &amp; la vall&eacute;e from my hunchback friend and then retraced my steps. From the bridge over the Wimereux where it passes through Wimille I stood for a few minutes to watch 2 enthusiastic fishermen (English officers) with rod &amp; line playing for trout &amp; other fish.</p>
