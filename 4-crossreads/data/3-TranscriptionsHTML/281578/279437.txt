The people here  are bonza &amp; I had a ripping time. While Booey &amp; Eldridge were using the tucker I put some water on the stove to boil for our tea. There were two girls, 29 &amp; 27 ( I always ask them "quel age") &amp; a very kind old lady &amp; 2 or three other nice women, talk about fun, I got on splendidly rattling out French. About 8 p,m. I came in to the room to write up my diary, they were all just sitting down to tea, as the estaminet is open to the soldiers from 6 to 8, I suppose they leave tea till late. When I entered the room behind the bar, there was the family sitting down to tea, there was Georgette, the pick of the bunch, Bertha, both of whom are engaged to soldiers</p>
