 
Some Fokkers and Taubes got over our lines and did some observing which unfortunately for us all was correct. Whilst we were sitting down to tea, we were all startled by the familiar hiss of a big shell and heard it coming straight for us. You bet we all ducked. It struck earth about 150 yards from us and caused a deafening roar sending dirt etc flying in all directions. A few of us went up onto a high ridge of land about 100 yards from us and sat down to watch the fireworks and I can assure you they kept it going. Shell after shell came hurtling over and it was almost terrifying to see them gradually creeping up towards our lines. I saw several large ones burst close by to us and it is truly an awful sight. One shell we watched go right plunk on top of a small bivouac and the remains of 2 men who were sleeping inside were never found.

Of course it goes without saying that during a long range bombardment of this kind, severe loss of life is always in it wake, as they rarely waste such valuable ammunition unless sure of profitable results.

Right up to about midnight this shelling continued, sleep of course being impossible. They seemed to be falling all round us and yet by good luck none actually got us, but at the same time I think that they are leaving us too long in the same position.
