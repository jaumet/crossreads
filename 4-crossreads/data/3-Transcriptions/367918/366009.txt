<p>My dear Judge,<br/>The figures on attached may be of interest to you. They are accurate as far as I can ascertain from our official Records Section as regards admissions etc but the average strength &amp; total numbers through the country, are merely rough guesses on my part.</p>
<p>I should think the admission rate for sickness is higher than that in France &ndash; considerably.</p>
<p>Malaria has of course been largely responsible for our casualties. In the Anzac Division alone there were 5285 evacuations with Malaria during 1918 and the Australian Division and Camel Corps &amp; other units were subjected to it to the same extent.</p>
<p>We are all waiting developments &ndash; authority is through for repatriation at full speed ahead &ndash; as fast as boats are available so we should not be long now.</p>
<p>With kindest regards</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>R.J. Hunter</p>
