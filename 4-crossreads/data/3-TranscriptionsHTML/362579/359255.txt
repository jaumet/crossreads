<p>I have not received your Xmas parcel yet. Hope it comes before I get another move.</p>
<p>Think I told you in my last that I heard from Fred   &amp;  he is well.</p>
<p>Have not heard anything of J.C. so am not thinking any more about it. Have decided that >u>that</u> little Affair is  ended. Tell people it is all over   &amp;  that I made a mistake. <u>Such is life</u>.</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all. I must get my report written now. How sad poor Sarah's death was, still she did not suffer long   &amp;  that is a blessing. Hope you are all well   &amp;  happy   &amp;  having a good time.</p>
<p>From<br/>Edith</p>
