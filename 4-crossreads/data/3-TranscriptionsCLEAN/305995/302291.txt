One & all were pleased to return after our strenuous time & consequently made a rush for our canteens, who had already well stocked their tents with foods for our return. All is peaceful once more & now we may sit in comfort & enjoy a tin of sardines & one of fruit, which is just about enough for a soldiers lunch. Brigadier Meredith & General Cheval had the boys paraded & heartily thanked then on their splendid achievement & informed us that on evidence received from the prisoners they left Bir-el-Abd with only four thousand men out of their original number.
The grand total of the Turks captured & the wounded we have treated, exceeds seven thousand, exclusive of the dead they have buried & wounded whom they transported during their retreat. Our casualities amounted to about forty killed, six hundred wounded & fourteen missing, so you see we had the best end of the stick from beginning to end. Thus ends a battle & victory that should have a prominent position in Australia's history & I am proud to be a soldier in one of the finest divisions in the world, viz:-
"The Anzac Mounted Division,"
