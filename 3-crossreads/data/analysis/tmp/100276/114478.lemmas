 at one time they knew our everi movement but we have them now . This even I went over to the pictur show saw the pictur after this follow a concert by the 2nd Battalion , it was a pretti poor affair just befor the "interv " they brought a Tommi on the first song he gave was alright he then follow this with a pretti smutti one , this was alright , but he follow with a dirti rotten thing but he never got far for the boy howl him down count him out no one like the idea of treat a Tommi like this but it was absolut necessari , for a Y.M.C.A. is no place for this class of sing , a pub might be right enough .
