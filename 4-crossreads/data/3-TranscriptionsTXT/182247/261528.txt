 Day off till 5.&nbsp; Had warning for duty.&nbsp; Saw Norman Walker on his way back from the line.&nbsp; Looked very dirty and neglected and wondered if his little wifie would know him as he was that day.&nbsp; Spent most of day helping Herb fix door on dugout.&nbsp; Went out at 5.30 through Hellfire Corner to ridge beyond.&nbsp; Got into a barrage andstayed in trenches for an hour while it lasted.&nbsp; Had an anxious time.&nbsp; Saw balloon come down in flames.&nbsp; Watched our guns open in answer to Fritz barrage.&nbsp; A very awe inspiring and terrific xxxx sight.&nbsp; Worked putting elephant iron and sandbags on dressing station until 11.30 and set out for dugout arriving there about 1 am. tired and utterly exhausted.&nbsp; Slept as soon as I lay down.&nbsp; Too tired to get something to eat, though starving.&nbsp; Did not awaken until John called at 8.30 next morning.

 Set out at 9 for Hooge again to load pack mules with dump material.&nbsp; Fritz shelling roads as hard as blazes.&nbsp; Waited an/hour or more for lull in shelling.&nbsp; There did not seem to be a safe place anywhere in this dreadful region of destruction and death.&nbsp; Got going about 10.30 and, after loading mules, set out with them to advanced Dump in Glencorse Wood.&nbsp; Took stuff off the poor beasts and set out again for home.&nbsp; Arr-ived there 2, thoroughly knocked up and shaken.&nbsp; Stripped off and had bath in shell hole with Herb.&nbsp; Felt much refreshed.&nbsp; Spent rest of day in dugout resting.&nbsp; Weather perfect.
