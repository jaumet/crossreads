Wallington 13.2.18.
Dear Old Bett.
It's high time that I sent you a line, to tell you just what Ive been doing, in these stirring times, but this will only be a short note. I landed here on the 4th and have been here ever since, I really intended trying to hunt up some of the relatives, but the time has simply vanished so after the first couple of days I decided to stay here alltogether for no matter where I went I could never receive a warmer welcome. One day last week I met Lilian Church, whom you may remember, "the Girl that you forbade to Kiss me, - at Ross more. we went to Westminster Abbey together but could not see all of it as there was a service in progress, we then went and had a cup of Tay, at the Corner House "Strand" ? then I took her back to the Hos. ? Yesterday I went to Edmonton, to see one of my mates who is or was in Hos there, only to find that he had left that morning .. I came back to London, walked from L?pool street Stn. down to Threadneedle st. then on along Cannon St. to St. Pauls. and on entering found a sermon in Progress so did not see all of that Edifice, it is a fine place, and would take quite a long time to see properly. Tomorrow I may run up and see the Tower, and if possible the Museum. I may be able to do it in the time
