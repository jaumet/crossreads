  
 Sat. Nov. 14th 15 The Indian Ocean is beautifully calm like some big harbour. We have not seen any land since Albany. Nothing but sea of a lovely blue violet color. The sun is hot. We practice our Signalling on the Sun deck, & have a very nice time of it. Thursday 23rd 15 Still in the Indian Ocean, expect to sight land to morrow. Yesterday we had a funeral so had the opportunity of witnessing a burial at sea, it was very impressive Thursday 25th We are now in the Red Sea passed through Hells Gate this morning. Yesterday we sighted land for the first time since leaving Albany, & [saw?] what appeared to be a small island in the distance. This morning we saw plenty of land on Arabian & African coasts. After being away from land for so long, a great deal of interest was aroused. The sea is now a dark green color. Both coast lines are hilly. Yesterday again we saw ships for the first time since Albany, this morning we have seen several already.
