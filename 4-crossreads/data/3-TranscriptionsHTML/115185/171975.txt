<p>My own beloved Mother<br/>I thought of sending you a cable to wish you many happy returns of today. But I could not get into town to do so until too late.<br/>I have thought of you all day. I have had to write the date so often on requisitions etc and each time, the thought, "Mother's birthday", has come to me. I wonder what you did and if Father remembered in time to have a gift ready?<br/>I do wish you were here. You would be so interested in everything. But it's awfully sad. Of course &ndash; I know it's sad in Australia &ndash; but here you'r up against it all the time. I long for you and Father to talk to. I sometimes wonder if I'll ever see you again. I went in to the National Bank of Egypt on Friday to get a draught if that's what you call</p>
