<p>and two British Field Ambulances in spare time during the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost entirely constructed of concrete it would take a tremendous amount of shelling to damage it.   We then returned &amp; the M.D.S. had a look round &amp; then proceeded to our camp where we had dinner.   We then marched out with the crowd to the M.D.S. &amp; had a good evening with the 2nd  Field crowd taking over the place early next morning.   The night was cold but I spent a better night then the one previous.  This sector is remarkably quiet hardly any shelling at all &amp; one can walk about quite freely.</p>
<p>Thursday 31st Jan<br/>   Took over from the 2nd &amp; straightway had 3 cases, quite an event.   I was put in charge of the station so had a busy time fixing everything up.   The place was left in rather a bad state so with the small staff available we all had plenty to do.  I had a dispenser with me</p>
