Dear Old Dad,
I see by the latest letters I've just received that you have had a very rough time of it indeed.  It has not appeared from previous letters that it had been so serious, but I see that you had pneumonia.  I am very glad to know you have got over it, and I hope that the rest and plenty of rum and milk will have restored you again to good health.  I hope you picked up well at Coonamble, and long ere you receive this, you will be boxing on in good style as of old.  It will then be just a few short months before you will be retiring to enjoy the fruits of your arduous labours.  May you be completly recovered and healthy to enjoy a good spell is my earnest hope. 
You might remember me to the Nesses when next you write.  Is Willie married now?
Cheerio then, Dad, & I hope you have a big smile up and able to blow the froth off a long-sleaver.
Your loving son, James.
