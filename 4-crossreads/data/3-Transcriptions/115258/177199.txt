<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>More mail from home! Two jolly nice long ones this time, one from you and one from Hal. Yours dated 10th Jan and Hal&#39;s 14th.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still in isolation in the 14th but expecting to be let out on the day after tomorrow; that&#39;s if no other of the wretches go and get measles or do anything funny like that. A notice came round a few days ago saying that 10% of the AIF in Egypt would be granted 1 month&#39;s furlough to England on 6/- per day &amp; 6/- tucker allowance. I was not going to put in first, as I dont think England would be much under war conditions, but in the end I did send my name in, and now I&#39;m rather glad as I find Jim Ayre and Cpl Edwards have also both applied for it. All the same I dont expect to get it. A great number are in for it I believe, and the applications are judged on nearness of relatives in England, and a persons length of service; so my case does not look too good. If I should happen to get it I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to send a cable for <s>Eng</s> &pound;20, I may not want it, but it would be better to have something to fall back on. I suppose Commonwealth Bank is the place to deal with in London.</p>
