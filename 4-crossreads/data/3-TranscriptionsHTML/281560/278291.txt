<p>today. It was a piece of gorgeous luck; and I am very popular today; if I do say it myself.<br/>23/8/16.<br/>Reached Val-de-Maison, yesterday and a few details joined us there. A Brigade parade this afternoon at Savigcone. Birdwood came to issue D.C.M.s to those who distinguished themselves. The Third Battalion got 3, D.C.M's and the Doctor got the Military Cross.<br/>24/8/16.<br/>Did a stiff march today, but as there was some rain last night the roads were good. This place is called Gezaincourt. We have struck a fair billet, though it is very verminous and has an extraordinary collection of odours, even for France and that is saying something.</p>
