<p>pleasing to notice how this glorious advance has cheered the AUSTRALIANS up. Even the poor fellows in the Infantry have lost that discontented look &amp; seem merry &amp; bright. These fellows deserve all the honour &amp; praise we can give them in this terrible struggle.  They have at last got Fritz with his tail down, &amp; are still pushing him back. At 2 p.m. we received orders that we would move on again next morning, we have come a good distance already, it must be close on twelve miles. The country surrounding the town was looking very fine. The barbed wire entanglements scattered about the fields stretched over &frac34; of a mile in places &amp; between 30 &amp; 40 feet wide, but this did not hinder our advancing troops. All wells, &amp; food stuffs lying about must not be toucher, in case of it being poisoned. Our squad consisting of Corpl Marlow, E. Calfe, Pat Eagan &amp; myself, spent another quiet night, discovered another comfortable dug-out &amp; all slept like a log.</p>
<p>March 19th.<br/>A beautiful spring morning. Arose at 7 a.m. &amp; took a walk through the town.</p>
