 24/8/16 Left at 9.30 am for Horseferry Road and found my board could not sit as papers had not arrived, so met Skene Smith and made for Hotel Cecil. Walked right up to Ludgate Hill and after a roam round St Pauls returned to the old Cock Tavern in Fleet St. for an old English meal of Roast beef. Old fashioned black fittings partitions between tables and a waiter of the old school. By 'bus to the Bank of England and had a look through the foreign exchange department. Round the Exchange etc and then walked down Cheapside past Bow Church as far as St. Sepulchres with its old dull musty interior. Then to Batholomews Hospital being content with an outside view and then passed on under the quaintest archway in the "Ye olde Church of St. Bartholomew" &ndash; green with age and full of interest. Spent an hour going thoroughly over the old place and examining Prior Boltons winton and the other sights. Raephere's tomb was sandbagged. Turned out to the right into the Cloth Yard full of old Elizabethan houses. Saw a gang demolishing an old inn the Old Dick Whittington dated 1569!! Returned home via Victoria then to the Old Bailley. How quaint these old churches are with their mustiness and dullness. Their darkness, their silence. Went through the Crypt of St Pauls and saw Nelsons grave, Wellingtons &amp; his old funeral car and Wren's grave
