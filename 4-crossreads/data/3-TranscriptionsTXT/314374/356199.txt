(15)After awhile it was found that we were on the wrong track, and the order "about turn" came along, which meant going back a considerable distance the way we came.  Eventually the right track was found and we continued moving onwards.
Shells were now falling amongst us and we took shelter, that is huddled together in shell holes, until the shelling ceased.  The next move brought us closer up and the enemy lights now seemed almost on us.
At last our starting off point was reached and we were, after much difficulty, placed in our appointed positions, our company being on the left of an old railway line, my platoon being about a hundred yards from it.
As we were getting into position a bullet got one of our men close to me, killing him instantly.  We were all sorry that poor old "Brumby" (that was the name we called him) had fallen. He came from the back blocks of Queensland and was a rough diamond, but had a good heart and was very popular amongst us.  He was uneducated and couldn't write and I used to write his love letters to his girl in Queensland for him.  He said to me, just a few minutes before he was killed, "Well I have been used to the bush all my life sleeping out amongst the dingoes &c and I was never afraid before but I feel frightened tonight".  We assured him that he would be alright, but he fell dead soon afterwards.  Such is war.  The corporal in charge of our platoon told us to make ourselves comfortable.  I said, "Where are the trenches" (having pictured in my mind well made and comfortable trenches which we generally occupied when holding the line).  He replied "These are the trenches" which were merely a series of shell holes filled with water.  Our tape was laid in a line in front of them.  A white tape was generally laid down in front of the trenches to keep us in line so that we could all advance together when the battle commenced.  We were glad to rest our weary limbs, even if it was only a muddy shell hole, it being now 3 a.m. - the approach march having occupied six hours.
In passing I may say that this was my first "Hop Over" (Battle) - although I had been up the line before on working parties - and I was quite fresh, in fact quite excited and had no idea of the dangers and didn't realize what was ahead of us and what we had to go through.
The officers and N.C.O's were now busy seeing that the various sections were all in order and in their proper positions.  The Germans were only about two hundred yards in front of us and they were continually firing flares (very lights) which lighted up nomansland splendidly.  Its a wonderful and very pretty sight to see the many coloured lights which the Germans (and we too) used to illuminate nomansland with, and also for signal purposes.  We used to say that the Germans had the contract for lighting up nomansland thereby saving us the trouble and expense.  White and gold lights were used for illumination and red and green for signals.  A civil display of fireworks could not equal the "free" exhibitions we used to nightly witness, and it would have gladdened the hearts of many children to have seen them.
