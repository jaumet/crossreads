We then Hurried up the Street to Charing Cross & the Train was just moving, so we hopped on.  This Railway is the famous South Eastern & is the slowest & roughest in the Country.  It was just like riding in a Cattle Truck.  On the way down to Dartford the    whi    railroad runs along the Thames for a good way.  It is about half way to Gravesend at the Thames Mouth.  We saw a Caravan City of about 150 Caravans.  I do not Know whether the Tenants were Gipsies or not as all were out of sight.  I saw hundreds of people on this potato planting business, some women & many boys.  Arrived at Dartford we had a mile & half to walk.  We hurried on & I soon got rid of my Patient & caught the 3 pm train back to London.  I saw a British air Ship while at Dartford & tried to take a snap but could not find the thing on the focusing screen.  The train did not arrive back at Charing Cross but at Cannon Street.  I did not know the way back to the Strand so I had to get a Taxi.  I then went out to Edmonton on the Motor Omnibus to try & see Cyril but He had just gone out.  I had to ride back on the Bus again & I can tell You that I had St Vitus Dance for half an hour afterwards.
