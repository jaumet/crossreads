 Tuesday 20 March 1917 
 Dancing has been stopped at Shepheards &amp; the Concerts so altho' Cairo is now a blaze of light once more, (general Street lamps lit etc. no aeroplanes to raid) Officers outside have only the Casinos &amp; Kellsaal to go to. Races &amp; Pigeon Matches still flourish. In the latter TRAPS are not used but a "nigger" in a PIT throws the pigeon into the air &amp; they take hitting 3 dead birds will nearly always win a sweep, with top notch pigeon shots from Monte Carlo among the shooters. Arrived El Arish once more, just in time to see the anti aircraft open fire on our old friend the TAUBE.
