Erquingham
After leaving Estaires we strung out along the road in small parties, as we were now within range of the German guns, and their aircraft were soaring aloft watching what was going on. We arrived at a small village Erquingham about 4.30 Everything around shows signs of the times. Trees broken off by shell fire, remains of houses and churches, shell holes in the roads and fields at almost every road crossing, there is a small buiding which contains a statue of the Virgin Mary and around this vases filled with fresh flowers. Quite a number of these we saw, that had been blown to pieces. While we were in Egypt it was quite a common remark to hear "How I?d long to be camped at a Pub" and here we are in this little French Village, actually camped in an estaminent. From the window we can see the remains of the Church in Armentieres, which is minus its tower. Thanks to the Huns. 
To Day Is Mother's Birthday July 9th 
Below us is the Bar, where Beer and wine can be obtained at a penny a glass and next to that is the kitchen, where madam, and her assistant, cooks us a good feed, or we can cook it ourselves if we like. There are 35 of us camp at this place and there are only 2 women in it. And the Mob is on their best behaviour,, and if anyone forgets himself and uses strong language, the rest of the crowd are "down" on him like a ton of hot bricks. In the Bar Ted Grey is washing up glasses and in the kitchen Harry Dauch and a few others are sitting in the Bar with their legs cocked upon a table, just as though they were running the show, we slept peacefully on a full stomach, in spite of the shells.
