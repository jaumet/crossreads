<p>2nd May.1918.<br/>The gale has abated, though there is still a heavy swell. The old hooker is making good time always over the 300 miles a day. I did not think it was in her. We have minor engine troubles, and are very short-handed, so some of the chaps have been enlisted to work the ship. Most of the fellows are recovered from the sea-sickness. The food is very poor.<br/>7/5/18.<br/>Fair weather with a southerly wind, a strong current has been noticeable during the past few days. We have had a general medical inspection for some reason; to mark our progress I suppose. Have been having trouble with the starboard engine. Passed between two islands today. "St Paul" to starboard and "New Amsterdam" to Port. They are very small and barren. "St Paul" is the crater</p>
