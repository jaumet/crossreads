Franvillers Frontline
At 10 pm rode up to the support Bn H.Q. at Marett Wood and there relieved old Pat Currie ? the white headed Colonel of the 28th. Had some amusing conversation with him for he is a tremendous wag. Meanwhile our chaps were changing over and they got in alright. About an hour after they had settled down Fritz started to pump in gas shell on ourselves and the 24th. Anderson had to move all his chaps to a place further over to the right. Firing steadily the Boche kept pumping a deluge of gas into Ribemont and into all the lowlying ground along the river. Rang up Bde H.Q. and gave the direction (Morlancourt) for them to switch the field batteries on to the job of neutralising the fire. Unless one of our bright inventors can find a better thing than this yellow X gas we are going to be well "left"
