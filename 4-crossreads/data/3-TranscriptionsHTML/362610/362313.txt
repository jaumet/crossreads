<p>Friday 7 April 1916<br/>A rather warmer night &amp; slept comfortably through it. During the morning got my things straightened out &amp; then had a parade for inspection by the camp commandant, but at the last minute he sent word to say that it would not be held until the next day. It turned out a dull grey day &amp; was taken up with getting the men settled in their tents &amp; handing in lists of shortages. In the evening went down to Etaples for dinner.</p>
