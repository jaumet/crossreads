<p>came on board, and an inspection made of the ship. Every man on the boat had his temperature taken, and the result was an excellent one, as the boat was declared "Clean".</p>
<p>Shortly after dinner the "China" steamed along the canal, &amp; anchored about a hundred yards from the wharf. Launches crowded with women &amp; girls, were continually approaching the steamer, and the excitement amongst the troops was great, especially the West Australians who were continually seeing some one they knew aboard the launches. I was a little excited myself, &amp; from all appearances I will not be responsible for my actions when Sydney is reached. As soon as the West Australians (120 all told) disembarked, the troops were allowed ashore. I managed to get in the first launch load, &amp; about 2.30 p.m. I was seated in a Y.M.C.A. on the wharf enjoying a cup of dinkum Aussie tea. The men from the "China" received a good welcome here.  Special trains were available to convey us to Perth, and I took the opportunity of visiting the Capital of the West. Although the train trip was only a short one, the scenery at times was pretty. A typical Australian scene, bushy country, with weather board houses dotted here &amp; there. At the buffett in the Botanical Gardens, the men from the China, were welcomed &amp; refreshments would be obtained free of charge.</p>
<p>7 a.m. the following day we started on the journey to Adelaide, and the first days going was good, 378 miles was covered. The days seemed to drag terribly, as practically every-one was counting the days as we got nearer home. Beautiful weather greeted us in the Bight, the sea was like a sheet of glass.  The band still came to the fore, &amp; entertained the troops at night.</p>
<p>Four days travelling brought us to Port Adelaide.  We arrived at the latter before daylight on Friday the 6th inst.   The view of the land was rather pretty, as dawn was breaking. Two more troopships were close by - the S.S. Sardinia &amp; the S.S. Commonwealth.  Both these boats left the Mother country before we did. The Health Authorities came aboard, and the same routine was gone through as at Fremantle. The inspection was again a successful one, &amp; at 1.30 the South Australians <strike>disembarked</strike></p>
