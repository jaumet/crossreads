  
 I will probably look them up.  I arranged to have tea with him in the evening   Back to the Boarding House for dinner, which by the way was a good one, poultry included in the Menu. The afternoon saw me having a good time at the South Shore Pleasure Grounds. I joined a merry party, & had the best time I have had for many a long day.  The place resembled Wonderland City, Bondi, & I patronised the Scenic Railway, the Figure 8th, the Water [indecipherable] the Nonsense Room, & many other side shows too numerous to mention. I don't think I have ever laughed so much as I did this afternoon..  In the evening I visit the Palace Ball Room (resembling the Paddington Town Hall) & spend a pleasant few hours dancing. The Fox Trot, Anzac Waltz, & the Tank Crawl, were the new dances here. The music was delightful. There are three Ball Rooms in Blackpool & they are crowded nightly. In fact the place is just a mass of gaiety & pleasure. Nine days I stay at this great pleasure resort & never dull moment did I have all the time I was there. Along the Promenade, sideshows etc. can be seen in great numbers, very often I used to obtain a couple of deck chairs, & sit on the beach & enjoy watching the crowd. I took things easy, & the rest did me a lot of good as when I arrived in England, I felt very run down.
