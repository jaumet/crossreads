 On Sunday night hostile aeroplanes in relays dropped bombs on London. Casualties nearly 200. 9 Gothas were brought down. 
 Thursday May 23. 1918. 1388 [should be 1389] I am 18 months in France today. I would not like to put in another 18 months. 
 There is a cool change in the weather. A cold wind is blowing from the West. 
 Friday May 24. 1918. 1389. A cold windy miserable day. Early this morning the enemy put over 5 big shells on the next ridge across the river evidently in search of guns. C.Charles was sent to the hospital today suffering from sciatica in the hip. The day we left Allonville Hughie Gannon was sent to the base on account of indisposition &amp; being over 50. 
 Saturday May 25. 1918. 1390. Much finer today not so windy. 
 Just before dinner W. Richy was kicked by a horse while watering his mules. He had it attended to at the dressing station &amp; returned to the lines again. 
 The enemy bombed some of our largest hospitals behind the lines. 20 machines took part in the raid, &amp; were in two squadrons. A lot of damage was done hundreds being killed &amp; wounded.  Great indignatiess is felt. 
 Last night a horse disappeared from the line presumably stolen, as he was securely tied. Tonight the picquet is doubled. Two men on at at time. I am on last picquet with Ferguson. 
 Sunday May 26. 1918. 1391. A fine morning. During all the time I was on picquet there was an intense bombardment which gradually died down after 7.a.m. No one molested the horses or mules. There were 31 horses &amp; 23 mules total 54. The Sargeant &amp;  George McLoed salvaged some flour last night at Villers Bretneaux and were caught in the evening barrage and had to take shelter in shellholes. 
 [Two lines of shorthand &ndash; I wrote to my wife this evening.  Letter 129.  Also to Kitty Martin in reply to her last letter.]
