  
 His case is one of great interest because functional paralysis is rare with an actual head injury & because the paralysis corresponded to the hemisphere which had been concussed. How much real sensory loss - I mean that is due to actual pathological changes - can be known only after the psychical phenomena have cleared up but as I said we do not think there will be much. He has improved considerably since he came in. 
 I hope you will come & see him often. 
 With kind regards Yours sincerely George Riddock
