<p>53<br/>54<br/>Poperinghe this afternoon. It was A.1.</p>
<p>20/10/16<br/>First frost this morning by jove it was cold. The duck-boards around the place looked lovely under a snow white crust. It has turned out a lovely day, beautiful in the sun. The Aeroplanes took advantage of the clear morning &amp; were fairly active.</p>
<p>21/10/16<br/>Frost heavier this morning the house tops were snow white &amp; glistened in the early morning sun.</p>
<p>23-10/16<br/>Am just about to turn in after a busy day. We leave to-morrow for Steenvoorde but only for a day or so from there we are making for the Somme</p>
