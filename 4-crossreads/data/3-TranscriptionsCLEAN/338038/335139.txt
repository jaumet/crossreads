 My dear Father & Mother, We are on our second week here now and have had a very decent time altogether, and were pleased to have a wire from HeadQuarters yesterday extending our leave another week so that we will not be returning to the Peninsula till about the 5th October. I am the only Artillery Officer here from NSW: Capt Waite who is in charge of our Party is from S.A. and the other four, Lieuts Glendinning, Strachan, Goodwin & Lloyd from Victoria. There is really not much to do here - it is such a quiet little place. We occasionally get a Greek boatman and take a trip out to any of the Warships which happen to be in Harbour, but even that is becoming difficult
