<p>26<br/>replaced the "Encounter", which, with the "Aorangi" had altered her course &amp; formed up in the van. We are again proceeding without lights all scuttles being thickly screened; hence the cabins &amp; alleyways are like furnaces.<br/>Tuesday 8th : The submarines are again accompanying us. We are now moving forward in three lines, the Northern line being "Sydney", "Berrima" &amp; 2 destroyers; the central "Encounter" &amp; "Aorangi"; the Southern "AE1" &amp; "AE2".<br/>6.30 pm. During the day we sighted three vessels which proved to be the "Murex" (oil tank) "Kooloonga(?)" (collier) and "Yarra" (destroyer). These are also proceeding to the rendezvous and left Moresby on Sunday afternoon.<br/>I forgot to mention yesterday that at 6.30 am one company of Reserve was transferred to the "Sydney" from which ship they are to embark on some hazardous undertaking as soon as they arrive at the fleet's objective. Lieut Bowen is in command and is accompanied by Sub Lt Webber and Midshipman Bullen. We are again steaming without lights.<br/>Wednesday 9th : Our course is now (7 am) N.N.E. and on our port hand the land is faintly visible.<br/>12.00 noon : We have reached the rendezvous where we arrived about 10 o'c. At 8 o'clock smoke was visible on the starboard beam. This proved to be the Battleship "Australia". Our augmented fleet are now hove to waiting for further orders.<br/>2.00 pm : I understand that we proceed direct from here to New Britain, a German possession where stubborn opposition may possibly be met with. I accordingly now close this portion of my diary and will place it in a safe place. "Tomorrow to fresh fields and pastures new".</p>
