  
 eccept for a my little pal in Davy Huxley & I don't know yet whether he is still running, he was when we went in but I have not had a chance to look him up yet.  Hosier went away sick but ought to be back any day now.  I have not heard from Ken yet but expect to any day, in fact I am sweating on a big mail from Australia, a lot of the boys have already got theirs but it generally takes a few days to get out.  I will have to finish this later as we have just been warned for parade.
