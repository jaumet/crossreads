<p>"Somewhere in France"<br/>17/iv/16</p>
<p>You will notice that we have arrived fairly near the scene of big events.  At present we are continuing our training but expect to go forward very shortly.</p>
<p>The weather here is still cool and wintry &amp; we feel the change very much after Egypt.  The French people have given us a most enthusiastic welcome &amp; I feel sure that Australia's name will quite safe in the hands of the men we have here.  I am feeling fit &amp; well &amp; think this life agrees with me.  Robby Peake went over to the53rd Batt.  I think he will get his Commission ere long.  Please excuse P/C but time is pressing as mail leaves tomorrow.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br/>M.C. Moors</p>
