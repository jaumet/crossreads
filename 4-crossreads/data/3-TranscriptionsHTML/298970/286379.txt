<p>19th August (Saturday)</p>
<p>Still raining.  By a little bit of headwork managed to secure a very soft job &ndash; sweeping a room out after meals.  This is all I have to do daily.  Letter writing cut down to three letters a week each one not to consist of more than two pages.</p>
<p>20th August (Sunday)</p>
<p>Raining.  Church Parade at Y.M.C.A.  Everyone in this village seems to go to Church.  The chiming of the church bells is beautiful.  Kit inspection.  22,000 Tommies arrived from the Somme.  They are a merry lot notwithstanding the heavy losses.</p>
