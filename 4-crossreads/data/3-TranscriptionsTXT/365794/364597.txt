Sunday 14 July 1917 [1918]Church 9.30 a.m.  A fair no. of our boys came too.1/2 day & went on Nile.  Gyppo refused to go out longer than 1 hr. (charge Pt. 10 per hour).  Sisters Leed & Peile with me.  At 6 p.m. drove to Geiza gardens then over English bridge & tram back to 31st.  Food is much improved & room cleaned up a little.  Nothing but discontent on all sides in the hosp., never have I lived in such an atmosphere of trouble & immoral behaviour imagined on the part of the Sisters.
