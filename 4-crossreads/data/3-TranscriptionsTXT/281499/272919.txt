 Well this is about the finish of the little book &amp; you must take no notice of the scribble for you have no idea of the difficulties I have had to put up with in the daily scribble, wet mud, rain, cold, personal discomfort &amp; all but still I have never failed to put my days entry into it &amp; hope it reaches home safely  It is now raining heavily by way of a change, &amp; Holmes is almost ready to go so I must cut it short &amp; say goodbye for a time   I will send the others along as I complete them for I intend to keep it going until I either get knocked out or the war finishes, at this date both Len &amp; I are safe &amp; we are out behind the firing line for a few days so don't worry "Finish."
