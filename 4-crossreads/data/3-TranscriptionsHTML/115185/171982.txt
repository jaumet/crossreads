<p>are very entertaining. Major Clayton is returning to P.A.H. &ndash; Col Teblutt is engaged to a nice girl here &ndash; Major Man is in the A.O.O. at Telel-Kebir with the Australian troops. Captain Davidson &amp; Tyler are still guarding the Dardanelles and the exit of the Goben. I often feel I'd be glad to have some one I really knew and cared for to talk to - one gets very interned living so much with aquaintances. Laurence was here. I had a message from him &ndash; that he wanted to know as soon as I arrived &ndash; only verbal. I sent a verbal one back. It may be hard hearted, for he may be killed, but I have not heard from him &ndash; poor boy. But he could write if he liked. Of course he may have left before I got here. I don't know.<br/>Your loving Betha<br/>Love to Mrs Hungerford</p>
<p>3rd A.G.H.<br/>28.3.16<br/>My own beloved Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Again a mail and I have not a letter ready. Jim &ndash; Colonel Jamieson came into my ward this afternoon. He is working in the unit till he returns in April at the end of his year's service. I think most of our other Majors &amp; Col's return too. A year is enough for them out here. It is too strenuous. I am working at high pressure now &ndash; and am very tired &ndash; but quite well. I like working for Major Lochardt Gibson and he is <u>very </u> kind to me. I have 112 beds and the income &amp; out go of the ward daily is on an average 15. We have been boarding patients rapidly. This entails a <u>lot</u> of work. Clerical &ndash; we really could do with a lot of clerks to relieve the sisters &amp; M.O.'s of a lot of mechanical work. This is only for you my opinion. I know however that you don't tell people what I say. I have a lot to write you about what I've seen here in my patients etc with regards our troops as seen</p>
