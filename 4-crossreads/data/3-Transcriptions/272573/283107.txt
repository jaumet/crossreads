<p>the night was far spent.</p>
<p>June 12th. Mon.<br/>Rumour has it that the Aust are going to make a raid on the enemies trenches in one sector to-night. We have been told to make preparations at our C.C.S. in order to cope with any exceptional rush of wounded easily, if the raid should be unsuccessful or if there should be a large number of casualties.</p>
<p>The raid came off all right and what a delight it was that there was only two casualties. A few German prisoners were taken and there were also a number killed.</p>
<p>A memorial Service was held in the Convalescent Ward in memory of Lord Kitchener who along with his staff had been drowned in the North Sea.</p>
<p>The prevailing thought is that we can never find a man who will be capable of filling Lord Kitchener's place.</p>
<p>Our memorial service co-incided with the great memorial Service being held in the Abbey of Westminster.</p>
<p>L.M. Johnstone going on leave to-night.</p>
<p>June 15th. Thursday.</p>
<p>My "luck is out". Just when I expected to get my leave home to "Bonnie Scotland" all leave is stopped for one reason or other. When Major Campbell told me that all leave had been stopped he also said a few of the other C.C.S.'s had had to put through 5000 wounded a day</p>
