next Christmas, but am living in hopes.  I entertain no doubt about the war being over before then, but it will take some time for us to get away, there are so many thousands of Australians in France.I received a letter from my dear wife today, dated March 19. 1917 & No. 55.  She told me she received 4 letters & cards also the cushion cover & table centre I got sent away from Armentieres by the French shopkeeper through the civil P.offfice.  It was very nice to know she got them safely.  After dinner I went with the transports to deliver the rations at the Catacombs Ploegsteert, Belgium.  The journey was uneventful but we saw several places where the huns had been shelling the road this morning.
Saturday May 12.1917A hot close muggy morning.  Last night it was very quiet, but there is some artillery activity in the region of Ploegsteert this morning.  Probably Fritz is shelling our roads.  There is also some aerial activity, our archies are occasionally shelling Fritz's Planes here in order to keep them up & prevent them observing.  There are also a lot of our planes about.  The mail goes out to day & another on the 28th. of this month.
