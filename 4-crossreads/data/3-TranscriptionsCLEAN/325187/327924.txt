 Do not open letter. Posted Notes yesterday hope you get them- Very hot & many Fatigues  More Aeroplanes but no more air fights, it was a great exhibition & once the two great Battle planes appeared over, 100 yards apart-  Ours was shot & so was the enemy - but he got away.  Our men blame our own Machine Gunners, as the planes were flying so close together it was madness to fire at all- Like Duck shooting hard to judge how far in front when travelling at the rate of 1 mile a minute. At Gallipoli it was heads down here its "Heads up" to see what brand of Plane it is. O Circles on Wings of ours + Cross on enemies.
