  
 A few days ago I had a very interesting trip to Sakkara one of the show places of Egypt distant about 10 miles from Mena.   Two of the other officers & I left by donkey after breakfast & had a very pleasant ride across the desert.  On the way we passed through several very picturesque but exceedingly dirty Arab villages - the people, camels, donkeys, buffaloes dogs & chickens all live together in mud houses with flat roofs.   On the latter is thrown all the household garbage - this place is used as a drying ground & also seems to be the principal place of amusement for the chickens.   Occasionally it is used as a playing ground for the children, the eyes ears & mouths, of whom is a playing ground for the numerous flies.  They never make any attempt to shoo them off.   Arriving at Sakkara we inspected several pyramids - these are not nearly so fine as ours which are known as the Pyramids of Gizeh    Ours are very much bigger & in a much better state of preservation.   Though called Pyramids of Gizeh they are not at Gizeh but at Mena    Gizeh is about 6 miles from here on the way to Cairo.   The chief interest in Sakkara is the wonderful collection of tombs of Kings - there were all hidden in the sand of the desert
