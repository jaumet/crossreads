  
 One day I went to the Island of Roda & saw the Nilometer constructed in 716 AD - it is a square well 16 ft. in diameter & in the centre rising out of some dirty green stagnant looking water is an octagonal column inscribed with ancient Arabian measures.  The office of measuring the water is entrusted to a sheikh & when the water reaches a certain height the water is allowed into the irrigation canals & thus the land is refreshed.  Here too is pointed out the spot where Moses was taken out of the bulrushes, but as we were shown 3 spots each equally historic in their owner's opinions  we  I am afraid that I could not be sure at which spot Pharoah's daughter really bathed & found the infant Moses.
