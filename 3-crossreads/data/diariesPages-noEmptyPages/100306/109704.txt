12/2/17 Firing Line. Le Sars
day was fairly quiet and nothing was doing until evening when we had a gas alarm which did not affect us much. He sent over a few gas shells. About 11 p.m. went up to both Coy. H.Q. without any incident. The thaw has set in and the duckboards are wet and slippery. Through Le Sars ruins up to within about 120 yards of the firing line remaining frozen to the spot when any flares went up. Found everything running smoothly and all looking forward to getting out tomorrow night. Issued the necessary orders. Fritz evidently holds his line in the same way as we do and no one quite knows where he is located. All round there are numerous old dugouts and they are a monument to his perseverance and plodding methods. Kruger D.C.M. was our guide tonight and is a character of high degree. Returned to dugout and sat up all night.
