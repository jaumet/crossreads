  
 We have got to watch the Natives very closely as some of the Arabs were searched & found to be carrying some ammunition about with them.  The Light Horse were ordered out to quell a rising with the bedouins. Arrived home at 10 pm & went to bed.  Have a very bad cold & fancy I am getting influenza.  A lot of our fellows very bad.  It is caused by the exceptionally cold weather at night.  It is much colder than Sydney. 
 Sunday 26/12/15 Nothing of any note took place. 
 Monday  Boxing Day  27/12/15 Had the Day off & spent the most enjoyable time since arriving here.  I & 2 Sgts, whose photos you will have, hired a (Garshee) for the day, & went out to the Pyramids.  I have often seen them on cards etc, but I never fully realised what they were like until now.  The drive there is most beautiful, through long Avenues with Trees on each side, & strange to say beautifully laid out gardens
