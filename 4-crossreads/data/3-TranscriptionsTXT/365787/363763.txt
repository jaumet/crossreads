In February we were asked if we could arrange a spinning circle &amp; Mrs. Andrew Reid most generously offered to house the instructress for a week, but altho the matter was talked about &amp; a notice kept on the station for a fortnight we did not get one application from anyone wishing to help with the spinning &amp; so had to decline to form a spinning circle.
The first wool we used we got from the War Chest but in September it was decided to buy our own wool.  We used to buy from the War Chest but the wool was poor in quality &amp; dear in price 9/6 per lb.  Last month we were able to buy direct from the Australian Mills at Marrackville &amp; have received wool of a beautiful quality &amp; are only paying 5/6 per lb.  We hope to continue purchasing it at Marrackville.  Our thanks are due to those who have made up the wool for us &amp; we would be glad of more knitters in the future.
