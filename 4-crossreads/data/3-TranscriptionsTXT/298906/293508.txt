you can hear is the poor quality of the Australian fish compared to the English, there never was such rot talked before, you won't hear so much of it after the war either I'll bet, with the exception of 2 or 3 varieties its very little I think of their fish & the rest of the boys are of the same opinion, I expect you have heard of the famous haddock well we have it fairly often, but its scarcely ever eaten, we think so little of it, & their mackerel well its only second class, we have fish of all descriptions fairly often, our Mess don't study the cost of food, only have the best, so I think I am in a position to express an opinion on these two foodstuffs
