19th May 1916
Raining in morning. Parade in full marching order postponed. All hopes of calling at any Australian port lost. The last sight of Australia I had being Cape Otway passed on Saturday the 13th. Some of the men on board saw Leewin Light last night at 9.30 or there abouts. Today turned out a very fair day with a nice starlight night. A.B.I.S.N. Steamer on our starboard side today but we left her behind at 3 oclock afternoon
