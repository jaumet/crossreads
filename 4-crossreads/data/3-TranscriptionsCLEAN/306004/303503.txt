  
 29.8.16 war news lately. heard today that a Division of Greeks refused to retire from the Bulgarians & were fighting. also heard tonight that Roumania had declared war on Austria & if this is right the end of the war cannot be far off. I am giving all the Signallers Lamp practice every night now; Today we were issued with a tin of Melon & Lemon jam for a change, it is the first time we have not had marmalade since we have been here; Swimming parties go to Mahomediah every day  but I always have a few odd jobs during the day to attend to & cannot very well get away but believe we are to have a few days at Sidi Beach (Alexandria) shortly & will 'be' able to get plenty there
