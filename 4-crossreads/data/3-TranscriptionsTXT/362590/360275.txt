 8. 
 Monday I am going to Wales for a while. 
 We are wondering here where our troops have been taken to. I think they are on the Canal &ndash; I do hope we get a chance at the Turks there. 
 I have seen Leslie Whitfield of course &ndash; he is now busy learning the art of flying I believe. Young Anderson-Stuart is staying here with me at present. 
 Please remember me to Keith &amp; George Edward. 
 Sincerely Yours 
 F. L. Flannery
