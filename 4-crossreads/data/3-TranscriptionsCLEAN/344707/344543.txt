 Dear Mother I am enclosing my Pay Book as a Record so I will not lose it - I should hand this in to Field [indecipherable] but prefer to keep it in case of arguments later on. You will see I've spent a bit, but I have the big item 153:16:11 in the Bank in Cairo. I sent you a Field Service Card to say I was alright as we have had another good fight at RAFA repeating
