 Wednesday 19 December 1917 Lovely day outside &ndash; in Connaught confusion reigns as usual. Town 2-5 &amp; bought bible &amp; French books.  Had farewell tea for E. Brown 9 p.m. (&amp; S. Leid of course). Now can find my way around in Cairo quite easily &amp; have one or two humble friends already. Yesterday bought bedside mat &pound;1-3-0, very pretty. M.O. sympathises with me over loss of "Elizabeth" from ward. Wrote Mother, Eva, P.C. to Edith. Kathleen born 22nd Sept. 1917.
