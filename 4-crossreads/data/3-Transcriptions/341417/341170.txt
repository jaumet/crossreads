<p>Gwen Dear,</p>
<p>Just a few dashed off lines. Had a glorious time "up" in London. British Australasian took four pages of sketches. Have sent through their London agent a big batch of sketches for the Sydney Mail to chose from. I feel sure the Lone Hand (Sydney) the "Queenslander" or some of the other illustrated Papers could use some. Keep all money <u>for yourself</u>. Don't ever send any thing here for me as arrangements are <u>rotten</u>.<br/>So far (3 weeks) have received not a word. Nothing since leaving Sydney, things in a rush. Head too scrambled to think. Address Sapper Vasco c/o British Australasian, High Holborn London.</p>
<p>Love for ever and ever from your Vasco. Miriads of Kisses from (who do you think)<br/>Same as usual to Jack Jen and Max. Not forgetting Hughie, the children and Peter.</p>
<p>[Written sideways in the left-hand margin:]<br/>Have just received three letters from the dear little mandolin player. The kisses were awfu' good!</p>
