<p>as we had just come from Egypt where the weather was getting hot.</p>
<p>For three weeks we saw the sun but three times.&nbsp; We are almost</p>
<p>within sight of the English coast (we certainly hear the British</p>
<p>anti-air-craft guns firing at the Zeppelins at nights) and to be so</p>
<p>near and yet be unable to get over there is rather tantalizing to</p>
<p>the boys.&nbsp; The British soldiers here get parcels daily from their re</p>
<p>relations and friends in England.&nbsp; Stuff cooked one afternoon reaches</p>
<p>them here at about midday following.&nbsp; Some of the British Officers</p>
<p>at the front practically live on stuff sent over from England -</p>
<p>roast chickens etc. - I can tell you, if there is one man who knows</p>
<p>how to look after himself it is the British Officer.&nbsp; All this re-</p>
<p>ceiving of parcels by the British troops started our chaps looking</p>
<p>for English relatives.&nbsp; They raked their brains for long forgotten</p>
<p>Uncles and Aunts and to these they wrote as &quot;your loving Nephew</p>
<p>Tom&quot; or whatever their names were.&nbsp; Some drew prizes, some drew</p>
<p>blanks whilst others found that their &quot;Dear Aunt&quot; had been dead ten</p>
<p>years!&nbsp; My tent mate struck a prize in an Uncle down in Cornwall</p>
<p>who asked for a list of anything he might want.&nbsp; He wasn&#39;t long in</p>
<p>getting it.&nbsp; We asked him for a case of beer (because the water</p>
<p>here was very bad and we were afraid of an epidemic of typhoid and</p>
<p>as the constant rains had wet all the wood about we were unable to</p>
<p>light a fire to boil the water)( a few bottles of whisky, (all the</p>
<p>water lying about had caused the snakes to be very bad), a case of fruit (we feared an outbreak of scurvy through living on tinned</p>
<p>meat only, no vegetables being available).&nbsp; We are now waiting for</p>
<p>him to send along the stuff.&nbsp; A favourite stunt in writing to, say</p>
<p>an Aunt was to say &quot;Mother used to be always talking about you,</p>
