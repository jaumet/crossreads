 Wednesday 17th Nov. 1915 Passed a very wretched day, Caused through the thoughts of losing my Dear Relations &amp; friends. After, a very trying time, in which I had to say good bye to all who are most Dear to me, I ran into trouble at the "Camp" where the fellows, most of them intoxicated were fighting among themselves.  However, barring a few sore heads they were none the worse for it.  I have to make this a very Black Day, as I have felt what sorrow is, &amp; I will carry the look of Dear Nina's face with me all through the War. 3 am. Reveille for the March to the Boat.  "H.M.S Persic" (A 34) Poor old Mum bore up well but felt the strain, also Oss , &amp; Edna. We are all naturally looking forward to see the ship which is to carry us Away, On! On! to what?  Glory or death 
 Thursday 18th Nov. 15 We are now on Board!  We left "The Warren" at 4.30 pm &amp; to say a further good-bye to Nina I came on a later Train to Seymours Corner, &amp; then got the Military Car to catch up with the Troop Trans.  We finally arrived at Woomooloo Wharf.  What a Crowd to see us off!  fully 5,000, but what a sad sight, nothing but tears.
