 Good night.  I shall finish this for posting in the morning.  Good night.  Good night. [A line of Xs and Os.] Caroline [A line of Xs and Os.] Josephine [A line of Xs and Os.] Kathleen. 
 24-4-15 &ndash; 3-30 p.m.  This morning I called upon Surgeon General Ford who is the chief in Egypt, had a confidential talk with him about my work &amp; my position here.  I was well pleased at the end of our talk &amp; I would not be surprised if he finds me a new position in the course of an early date.  If he does then Jerrom and I shall leave this rotten show.  My honour &amp; personal reputation are not safe in the weak hands that guide No 2 G. H., and to get away from it will be obeyed by me with the greatest of alacrity &amp; pleasure.  I shall send you a cable announcing my departure should it come about. 
 For the present Goodbye.  God bless all of you.  My best wishes to my friends.  Love to you three &amp; Maria in heaps &amp; kisses in loads.
