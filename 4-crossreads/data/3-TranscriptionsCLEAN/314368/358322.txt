Dear FatherA line or two to tell you that I was lucky enough to get out of Egypt at last and am now situated in a healthy part of old England. Word came through some few days ago that we were to pack for England and I can tell you we didn't take long about it. The trip took 9 days in all, from Tel El Kebir to the South of England and the experience was quite one worth having. Instead of coming around by Gibraltar we disembarked at Marseilles in France and came through France - a 50 hrs train journey to Havre where we embarked again for England.
The trip across France was one that I will never forget the country is at its best,  that is just in the middle of spring and the scenery especially in the south of France very beautiful indeed. After leaving Marseilles the railway follows the valley of the river Rhone
