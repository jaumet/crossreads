Well, my Dear ones, it is dinner time now & I am ready as usual.  I had my afternoon off yesterday but I only went for a long walk on the sea-front & there was nothing remarkable to be seen.
Kindest Regards to all my acquaintances which I hope to be able to renew in a few months time.
Best Love fromHarry
