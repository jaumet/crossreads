 
Artillery fire which is directed against it, It is an inferno of flying dirt & steel & I was sincerely pleased to be able to get out of it alive as all the time I was there, they kept a hot fire up on it. 

Our own artillery fire is very unpleasant, as the German trenches only being about 40 to 70 yards away, the shrapnel just grazes our own trenches & bursts on the top of the Germans.

I then went through Chicory Lane C.T.to Ridge Wood, where the various reserve battalions are situated & where our gun positions are. There was Batttery fire in progress & the vibrations made one feel pretty sickly.

After going round the Brasserie which is another hot shop I worked round through Yves, Voomeselles, thence round to Majors Copse, Captains Post & back to Battle Head where after a rest I returned home.

It is sorrowful to see the men who get hit. Those that are only wounded take it cheerfully whilst those that are killed are taken away & buried in quick lime. Whilst I was there one man was shot through the brain while another had his both legs blown off. Another his hand smashed & several others of minor consequence. The Germans were lying pretty thickly all over the place, their casualties being pretty severe or as one expressed himself, "These damned Australians can shoot some".
