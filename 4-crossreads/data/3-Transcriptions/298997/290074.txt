<p>As a consequence we are living like fighting cocks.  There was any amount of poultry, sucking pigs etc. left by the inhabitants, but they are rapidly disappearing; &amp; there is plenty of sugar, and tinned goods in the houses; while wine is a frequent discovery.</p>
<p>In Strazeele I saw a sight that made me boil.  The place is burning, &amp; the fires give light; and in a doorway of one house, I saw a tiny child lying as if it had grown tired of looking for its friends &amp; gone to sleep.  I thought that might be so, but when I stooped over it I found a big hole at the back of its head, &amp; all its curls matted with blood.  I felt as if I could go back straight to the line, &amp; pitch into a stunt.</p>
<p>I have visited Caestre again, which is quite close to where we are, which is near a village called as near as I can get it "Thistwarli".  That was, I think, two nights ago; we were doing picketing work.  The estaminets were doing a good business, &amp; the inhabitants carrying on as usual; and one girl, when I asked her if she wasn't going to get away, said laughingly: "Allemand not come here!".  But our picquet had hardly been withdrawn before the Germans started a bombardment, &amp; ever since the place had been bombed and shelled.  Today, I thought I would go in</p>
