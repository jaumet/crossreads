<p>21st April Friday 1916 Sohag.</p>
<p>I got a supply of red Ink today couldn't get black at least not of good quality So red is the colour now for some time to come. Ideal day to day.6 bags of mail to day and another 5 bags of parcels again tonight. If I go through this book I am afraid I should have a good total of bags to record and when Colonel Glasgow told me to take the post job on again when we came back from the peninsular he said that there would only be a few bags to deal with and then only once per fortnight. So much for the veracity of CO's. Smith our cook has gone to Cairo to undergo an operation to his leg, we shall miss him very much</p>
