  
 Sept 24th We arrived off Wilmshaven & stood off & sent in a steam pinnace off the Encounter under a Flag of truce demanding their surrender  The Australia & Montcalm manoeuvred until both had a broadside ready to let go in case they did not give in, we on board the Berrima were ready in fighting gear all ready to disembark in the ships boats, a small steamer came out & asked for time. Our admiral gave them 12 hours. The Frenchman gave them five minutes & swinging his ship round he prepared to let go when back came the answer by Flag signal O.K. The Encounter which was the nearest ship to the shore led the way into the Harbour followed by the Berrima, the entrance to the Harbour being very narrow, opening out when you get inside for about 3 miles being dotted with Islands, we anchored & landed E & part of H Companies also some naval ratings to act as a Garrison.  it is said that there is a good deal of fever here, but that is all in a Soldiers life.  We pulled up our anchor & started back for Rabaul, we had the Governor of New Britain on board with us & that perhaps made them surrender so quickly as he advised them to. We left there at 5 pm after landing stores etc for the Garrison 
 Sept 25th at sea again returning to Rabaul concerts as usual at night, part of our celebrated Tin Can band which belonged to E & H Coy's made it weaker      so we had to put up with a smaller one only 2 & 1/2 companies  being on board, still all lights out at night time making ship very dull & hard to find ones way about in the dark. 
 Sept 26th We arrived at Rabaul at 10.30 am & found all quiet at Rabaul  Troops are settling down to Garrison duty which is slow work after what we had been doing lately
