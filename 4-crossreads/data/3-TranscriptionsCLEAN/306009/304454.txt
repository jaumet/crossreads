1915Sep. 29 Wed.Went into Cairo at 4 p.m. to make inquiries about the present whereabouts of some chaps, at the Intermediate Base.Had a chat with Harold Kershaw who has come back from the Peninsula with dysentery.Am just about tired of Cairo & if no chance of promotion or move of the Unit takes place soon, I feel like going across to Gallipoli.
