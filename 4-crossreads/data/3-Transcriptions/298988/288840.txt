<p>(Major Bruce) &amp; his Officers &amp; the Ships Captain, and as they approach each group of men he gives a blast on the bugle &amp; the Non Com Officer in charge of the group says "Attention" &amp; they are then inspected as to tidiness &amp; completeness of kit etc &amp; the Officers then pass on to the next.  When finished a bugle call announces the fact &amp; the men are dismissed &amp; they then get into their working clothes &amp; get busy on cleaning stables, brushing horses &amp; exercising them around the deck.  Everything is done on the sound of the bugle so we get plenty of music.</p>
<p>April 11th<br/>Went ashore on Lemnos Island today, &amp; there are a few thousand of British &amp; French Troops encamped there.  There are three settlements on various parts of the Island &amp; the Greeks, (since the arrival of Troops), have built small weatherboard shops for the sale of soft drinks, cigarettes, Turkish delight etc.  The houses are built of rough stones, obtained on the Island &amp; where cracks occur in the walls, small stones are jammed in, probably to prevent the rest of the inhabitants of the village from gazing in.  They are rather airy, however, I should say.  They get their water from wells, having windmills rigged on top.  These are large wire &amp; wooden affairs, to which are attached canvas sails, which they can adjust to suit any wind that blows.  Also went on board the "Arcadian" which ship is the headquarters of the Transport Staff.</p>
