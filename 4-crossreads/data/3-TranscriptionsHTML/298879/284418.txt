<p>August 1915<br/>Sunday 8<br/>Fine    Firing still continues. (The New Zealanders have got the Turks on the run and driven them back about two miles which is quite a record for trench fighting.) Our Navy is firing high explosive shells into the Turks on the hill on the left. It is this hill that the N.Z's have practically captured</p>
<p>Monday 9<br/>Cool&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flies not quite so troublesome. We are holding our new positions. I am pleased to say. Our losses are heavy.  Out of 243 men in my company who charged over the parapets, only 36 came back , some of these being slightly wounded. We have captured many rifles, much ammunition and a large number of prisoners.</p>
