<p>the sun &ndash; in the distance the blue ocean sparkling like a jewel.<br/>Up the narrow winding path with its border of sad little mounds, one of which may be my lot before I can get to the Hospital Ship (We are always under the enemy's fire)<br/>Placidly come some Indians with ammunition mules. It seems more like a scene in a play than one of the most tragic drams in the world's history.<br/>I am not left long in doubt as to the reality of it all. A buzzing as of a huge bee &ndash; a flash of yellow flame &ndash; on the ground a mangled heap from which slowly trickles a dull red stream Far away across the sapphire ocean just a few more will be waiting in vain for the return of their loved ones.</p>
<p>I reach the clearing station &ndash; it presents a scene of well-ordered confusion; everywhere on the narrow beach are numbers of wounded awaiting their removal to the Hospital Ship. This cannot be carried out till well after sundown, for the enemy are sending a continuous rain of shells in this direction.<br/>Ere our transfer to the boats we each have a label pinned on to us stating the nature of our wound. Many are gasping out their lives before they can be transferred to the boats.<br/>We are put into the boats and are towed away to the Hospital Ships &ndash; we are towed from ship to ship; always the same reply, "Full up" &ndash; eventually we manage to get aboard one. The cot</p>
