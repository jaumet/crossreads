<p>[YMCA Letterhead]<br/>1st Field Ambulance<br/>Lemnos Is.<br/>4 Nov. 15<br/>My dearest Irene,<br/>I have no news, but am writing this as a sort of Xmas letter. Well! old girl I hope you are all well &amp; happy.-<br/>So far we have had no Confirmation that we have been officially taken on the strength of the 1st Field Ambulance. &ndash;Lt. Col. St. Vincent &ndash; Welsh is O.C. &ndash; I wonder if Will knows him. Have seen Major Hersechall Harris &amp; had talks with him on many occasions. What a decent chap he is old girl! He always wants me to let him know anything I need.<br/>It is three months since I have had a letter (or nearly 3 mos). Is not it a shame? Do hope I get one soon. Did I tell you I saw Lou Stobo when going thro Alexandria? He wait &amp; saw me off. -</p>
