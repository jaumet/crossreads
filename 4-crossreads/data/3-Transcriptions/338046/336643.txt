<p>1917<br/>Dec<br/>tarpaulin we spread on the floor. The big tarp was pulled over some beams supporting a big wheel leaving enough space to put in a tin to have a fire in. by the following night we had a pretty tout possie. Tout (pronounced TOOT is a 30th Battalion expression which means 'very good'.) It was made up by a man of our battalion, whose knowledge of French was limited. He had heard the expression " toute de suite" &ndash; quickly but thought that toute meant good. From the floor we were on, (we were on top of some large kilns not in use, we could look straight down onto a large dam covered in ice and we had a view of the snow covered hills with the railway line at the foot. The siding was only about 200 yards away and was reached by going along the cement works private line. being the middle of winter it was of course necessary for us to have coal and as it was not supplied to us, we used to go out after dark with sandbags and get it off trucks that might happen to be in the siding. It was not strictly legal, but the coal kept us warm</p>
