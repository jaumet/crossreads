 Saturday 22nd September 
 Went to Fencing School this morning, all the young Italian &amp; French Bloods go in for it here but never BOX. 
 I have been made an Hon. member of UNION &amp; Mohammed Aly Clubs &amp; meet a number of people &ndash; but this does not get over my impatience. 
 [The remainder of the page crossed through.] Posted notes yesterday but they are only of interest to the family I think. How different this life to that of Clare Station!!!! but I  never  forget. Went to Races &amp; paid my expenses then on to San Stefano as a guest to dinner &amp; the usual HOTEL dance.
