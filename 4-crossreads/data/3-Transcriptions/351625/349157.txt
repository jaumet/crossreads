<p>little presents when we go on leave so when you get them after Christmas you will understand why they were late getting there.  We had a photo taken on Sunday evening in front of our hut but have not seen the results yet, will let you have a couple as soon as we do.  Since we have come to this camp we have had a pretty easy time of it, no strenuous work &amp; very little other so we have been enjoying ourselves.  On Monday we had some practice at Platoon in attack, did some charging at trenches just as it is supposed to be done at the active thing.  I believe the 1st, 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th Battalions have been getting hit pretty hard in France lately but we hear nothing certain.  I have just had a good soup supper which is served out at 8 p.m. every night &amp; I can assure you we enjoy it, it makes one sleep well.  I wonder what you will be doing this Christmas at any rate I hope you have as good a one as usual, the chances are we will get a few days leave if we are still in England</p>
