<p>men and I was unlucky. However a few hundred cases of them have just come aboard and they are going to be issued out!! So things are looking up alright. Bill West and Jim Ayre are on board. Bill will go straight back to Melbourne when we land i think. Its getting jolly cold down this part of the world. I hope you keep the winter turned off for some time after we get back. See you all soon. Love to Father &amp; H &amp; F &amp; Aunt Katie</p>
<p>Your loving son Rob.</p>
