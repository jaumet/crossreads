  
 16th We left our kind friends and reached Rouen here by Serquigny and Oissel about 8 p.m. 
 We drove to the Hotel D'Angleterre and were soon comfortable again. 
 17th We went for a drive round the town after lunch in a taxi and through the big pine forest.  Thousands of these fine trees are being cut for war purposes.
