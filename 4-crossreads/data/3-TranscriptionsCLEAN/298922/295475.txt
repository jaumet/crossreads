 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  Laura writes that she has seen my Father in Law's death in the Paper at home - I have had no Cable so am not worrying too much yet it may be another man - Dolly will feel it. Visited 3rd L.H. & took them down at Bridge last night. 
 Tomorrow a French Cavalry General is to witness the L.H. take a Redoubt - Nowell's Camels will be on our left, a sort of Field Day showing L.H. doing dismounted duty like Rafa, MAGDHABA over again, but this time no real enemy. 
 Got some splendid shirts for the men from the L.H. Depot Sydney - most acceptable as the warm weather is here now.
