<p>with blood, but still going on (The boot had been struck but the fancied blood was mud)</p>
<p>Charge!!! With an exultant cry, just as if they had been a little bit late in starting, &amp; "away" goes that line of darting dashing men, now one in the lead, then back again, as it were, he comes, now another out in front, some few drop behind, &amp; for some yards the see-sawing takes place, but the line as a whole is apparently as straight as when at "Quick March"</p>
<p>Of course the good ground accounts to a great extent for this.

A stirring cheer ran right along the length of the line of panting men, rousing the painfully depressing feeling of physical strain &amp; the last 50 to 70 yards were cleared without an effort. Hardly time to think! When My G-d! What is this!!! The careering line leaders had run into a "murderous" entanglement of barbed wire impossible to break, cross or pass!! The men ground their teeth in vexation and almost dispair &amp; cursing loudly all &amp; sundry, dropped the next second, to the ground, to get ready to fire &amp; "do your damnest"!</p>
<p>Then Here's a bally gate! rang out from the fourth man away, &amp; in the</p>
