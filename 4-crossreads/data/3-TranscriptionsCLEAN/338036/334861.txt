  
 [7th Jan. contd] good time.  With the exception of a continual bombardment by our boys there was nothing doing. 
 Monday 8th  [Jan] [indecipherable]  came up for a bath today & he told us that Fritz dropped about 70 [?] near R.A.P. this morn.  No casualties reported to date.  Very cold wind this afternoon.  Reced numerous papers tonight. 
 Tuesday 9th Very cold today.  Extra special bombardment tonight. 
 Wednesday 10th Saw a very [un] usual sight this afternoon.  Two of our observation balloons were up from midday (sausage type)  At about 4 pm I was working in the back of Baths near our Incinerator when a bright flare lit up the sky and looking in the direction was astounded to see the object diving to the earth from a good height leaving behind a wide trail of bluish black smoke.  At same time aircraft guns from all directions opened fire and it was then that I realized a German had settled one of our balloons.  Our guns gave him a hot time but he evaded them & when over his own lines the enemy aircraft guns also opened fire giving the impression that he was disguised as one of ours.  It was a grand sight.
