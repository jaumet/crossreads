<p>April 1917<br/>2nd continued   The weather has been bitterly cold all day &amp; at about 4 P.M. we had a very heavy fall of snow which lasted about an hour &amp; a half, &amp; with a strong wind, almost a gale, blowing all day, things have been rather miserable.<br/>At about 3 AM this morning the anti-aircraft guns near here were firing at some of Fritz's planes &amp; again at about 8 a.m. when seven of them came over.   No damage was done &amp; they were driven off.<br/>I received orders to-night to return to the company with the party to-morrow morning.</p>
