  
 had a grand time - There we had aftn tea then a Jap Captain came off - He lives here - He brought his wife & kid - I was introduced. She shook hands & bent herself nearly in halves - We all had Beer & said 'Banzai' which is equivalent to Cheer.Oh - in Japanese - Then Fitz Bond & I went to the Beach & walked & I showed them the gardens & Bond (a Lieutenant & good chap) aired his ignorance of Botany - He's been accredited with knowing plants - I listened I enjoyed his talk muchly - He was invariably wrong - He suddenly discovered that I was his master in that line & he subsided incontinently though I am sure I was quite nice & deferred to him right thro - I showed Fitz & him the giant Ficus - Fitz adopts the nil admirari where anything German is concerned which is very misplaced - anyway as regards these gardens & experimental plots -
