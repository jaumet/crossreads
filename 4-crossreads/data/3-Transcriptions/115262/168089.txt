<p>Sunday 18 November 1917.</p>
<p>Moved out at 11 a.m. &amp; travelled through several villages and orchards. The scent of the blossoming hedges is beautiful. The orchards have been well kept &amp; watered.</p>
<p>Bivouacked 2 miles from sea.</p>
<p>(A crook camping ground practically a bed of thistles).</p>
<p>No picquet for me tonight.</p>
