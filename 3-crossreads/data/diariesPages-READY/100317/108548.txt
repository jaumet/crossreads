5/6/18
Our parties had all knocked off at 1 am and Thewlis and I returned to Bn. H.Q. At 2 am a heavy Hun barrage opened and the Tommy Gas sergeant came along to our R.A.P. wounded. The strafe kept on and our was sent up in two places. Our guns opened heavily. The Germans attacked on a front of 520? with about 250 men and entered our trenches on the 19th Battalion. Our men got to them properly and drove them back rescuing some men of ours they had stunned and taken off a little way. After a good stiff encounter we finished up with 16 unwounded and about a like number of wounded prisoners. About 25 Huns were killed near our lines and doubtless there are more lying ready to be ratted tonight. Our chaps drove him out
