 FEB.   SUNDAY 6   1916 
 Fine & hot. Went down to the Spit with M r  Lloyd for swim before breakfast. Cleaning up my boots ect after breakfast  Linda, Jo & Self went down to Clifton Gardens in car after dinner & had afternoon tea & tea at night there. All the Allisons were there & the M c Masters. Got the 8.25 boat back & nearly missed the train. Linda & Jo got back very late. We had a great day down there and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly  Linda & I had a great argument about former loves ect, she has the sounder reasoning, but my arguments are based on sentiment, which in these cases goes a long way.
