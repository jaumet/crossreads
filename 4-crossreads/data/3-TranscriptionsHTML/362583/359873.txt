<p>Gallipoli<br/>15th Nov. 1915</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>I conclude from the tone of most of the letters I received this morning that you have been returned from Brisbane, are in good health &amp; had an enjoyable trip. I was sorry to hear that Dorothy was not as well as she might have been, but all's well that ends well so that's that. I haven't hear for some time of Keith's movements but suppose he will be over here before long, but if he doesn't shake a leg I'm afraid he won't see anything of Gallipoli because the Turks are only going to last a month or two longer. Some people seem to think the end of this month will be the finish, but I think they will hang on till just a little past Christmas. By the end of the January we will be garrisoning this place instead of fighting- I can see dull days ahead, fancy living on friendly terms with the old Turk, instead of romping about with him. By the time you get this you will probably have had your Merry Christmas &amp; so the only wishes I can give are retrospective ones &amp; I give those in heaps.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son<br/>Arthur</p>
