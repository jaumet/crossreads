Set sail for Pt Said at 0530 caught the train OK arriving at Kantara about 0700 where we had to wait until 1130 before we got a return. Got into Pt Said at 1 first of all looked for sleeping quarters were fixed up at Hotel de-la-poste where we started off with an excellent feed then went for a stroll, the city is very clean very modern although the Italians are in the majority as usual, music is to be heard at every resturant. We spent nearly all our time in eating houses [indecipherable] cafes, after tea hired a garry went to the seashore where hundreds were bathing, drove all round finished up with two melons for supper, retired full tired.
