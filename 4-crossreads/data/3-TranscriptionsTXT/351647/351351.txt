very joyful reunion.  They want me to go over but I can't get about much, I'm tied here a lot & its so muddy & really its too hard on horses to ride.
Its a ghastly place.  I saw Dr. Lethbridge, he didn't look too well & is having a pretty rough time.
Winter isn't a joyous season of the year at any time & when there is no shelter but dugouts always damp & generally draughty its pretty trying.
Your friends the chilblains threaten me, but I hope they keep off.  I hate wearing things on my head & so of course my ears cop out, they would you know.
Hefty Lasham sent me a cake (her own making) which was jolly good & good of her.  I feel such a pig as I wasn't really so very very nice to her.  I haven't been reading much lately only magazines.  I had a long letter from my pal Tansey, he is well & came through OK.  I was glad as the New Zealanders had a hellish time.
