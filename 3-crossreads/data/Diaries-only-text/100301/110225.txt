as when we got there the guide who met us simply asked us are you Australians we said yes he never asked us what Battalion we belonged to the consequence was that we were put into trenches that should have been taken by the 20th Batt; we had only been there two hours had been working hard to cover up the chalk with black soil to hide the trenches a bit when the 20th Batt came along told us we were in their possy. So we had to get out we were led back again came to some more trenches occupied by some English troops who had only been there two days we had to relieve them
they had dug a trench behind a long row of Turnips that were in a heap, well a shell hitting this would not be any good as there was no resistance in turnips buried so while we were there I had to take out a man get in touch with the Platoon on our right no 1 Platoon was in trenches on its own so we had to find out where they were keep in touch through the night 
I took one chap we found them alright explained where we were of no 2 Platoon when I came back I got orders to put several men on Listening Post in a sunken road just in front I had no sooner got back when a shell came wounded my only corporal. 
I forgot to mention that at Messines I lost a Sgt who got shot through the Hip. So the corporal got sent away wounded in the back legs they continued to shell us for some time, and as we were well down to it taking shelter from the splinters
