<p>1919<br/>July<br/>at their bearings.</p>
<p>July 13<br/>On 13 July we had a church service with an orchestra.  The service was very good, but as the padre had asked that it was to be voluntary &amp; not a parade, he did not have too large a congregation.  However as in the lectures, the force of his personality took possession of those that did go &amp; all the other services were crowded out.  Practically everyone became Church of England.  At midday the same day we passed Cape Verde.  Our boat's pace was about 13 knots an hour.  A storm arose after dinner which lasted for about a day.  I forgot to mention that there were about 1,300 troops aboard, but there was plenty of room.  I did not sleep up on deck, but slept all the voyage in my hammock (tween decks).  Those who did start sleeping on deck came down below before we reached Capetown.</p>
