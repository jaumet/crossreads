  
 1-1-16 I scaled out as soon as I was paid, & came to Cairo parted with Arthur & Bottom & went to a Greek Dentist to have 3 new teeth on the plate, & while he was doing it wrote a letter or two at the Soldiers Club in the Gardens, then bought a Dnoto Fountain pen (75 P.T) &  a watch (65 P.T.) & I am now pretty well fitted up again for Active Service; It was very funny with the Greek dentist as he could not speak a word of English & to arrange the price he had to call in a French neighbour before we could come to terms. Bought some silk & sent it to Meg & Edie also sent away my diary & then came back to camp
