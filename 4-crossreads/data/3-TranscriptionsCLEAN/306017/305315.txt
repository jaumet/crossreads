  
 held today & they were a success.  The 6th LH won most of the events.  I went into Cairo in the afternoon & had a good hot bath & came out again shortly after tea. 
 Friday 11th  Was Regtl. Orderly Sergeant.  It is a fairly easy job but the waiting about all day I don't like.  You are continuously on duty for 16 1/2 hours & it gets a bit tiresome.  I received some letters this week from Mother, Kate, Doug, Cousin Will Gordon & Nell Ferguson also a pair of sox from Violet Blair. The weather in the day time is fairly warm now but the nights are still cool & you can always do with a few blankets. 
 Saturday 12th  Usual cleaning up parade in the lines all the morning. I stayed in camp in the afternoon.  Attended church parade on Sunday morning & went out to Abbassia in the afternoon to see Will Douglas but he wasn't in camp so returned to Cairo & called on Henry Newing.  He was out, so I thought it was good enough then to get back
