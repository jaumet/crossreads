The country is looking lovely and the lanes are screened by the dense hedges and render any movement along them very hard to detect from aircraft. The people are so beautifully clean and the little children spotless and well looked after. There seems to be much happy family life.

Had 6 hours off and then fell in for 10 miles of marching and this pick and shovel task, not ceasing until 4 am 2/6/16. Others worked all last night marched 10 miles in the course of that same work. Returned 3 am and fell in again at 8.30 marched to Croix du Bac, 8 miles in all on parade all the afternoon and then fell in again at 7 pm for this nights 10 miles march & labor.
