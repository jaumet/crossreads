bright full moonThe hun has been very active all the night. He was one plane every quarter of an hour from 7. till 12. & dropped a great number of bombs Scores of machine guns rattled at him but seemed to do little damage. He shelled use at us occasionally. My batman happened on the rum ration for several HQ men this afternoon & felt "another little nip wouldn't do him any harm" till he was awfully familiar with all & sundry, and finished up by spending the night in the Clink leaving my bed not made and things in disorder generally
Friday Oct 30thThe war situation is not very bright
