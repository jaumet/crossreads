<p>Tue. Aug 14th.<br/>The mountains on the East side of the bay are almost bare, with red earth outcrops showing here and there through the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Those on the Western side are covered with thick tropical growth to the tops.   The foreshores are a tangled mass of palms &amp; mangroves.   In a clearing on the beach just abreast of the "Wolf" is a village of the usual New Guinea houses on poles, but the appearance of the "Wolf" has caused the inhabitants to take to the hills.</p>
<p>At the far end of the bay a river apparently runs inland, two small islands guarding the entrance.   At the other end of the bay is the entrance through which we entered, which turns abruptly through the hills a few hundred yards from our anchorage.   The "Matunga" appeared at this entrance at 2 pm. and moved alongside.<br/>(The bay is Offak Bay.)</p>
