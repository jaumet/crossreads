The unexpected has happened. Snow fell last night or this morning the countryside was covered with fine powdery snow for all the world like fine salt. My first experience of snow. Not so cold, yet cold enough Rain sets in after breakfast mucks things up. short route march in afternoon. Get some letters off.
