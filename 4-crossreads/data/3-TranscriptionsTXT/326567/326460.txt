Guns fireing at a German Taube Machine which was very high up in the Air & looked to the naked Eye like a spec. The High Explosive Shells bursting all around it. The Taubes are soon driven back over their lines. Wednesday. 13/6/17All day long a lot of the boys were busy unloading Material from the trucks & building a Telephone Room also a Blacksmith Shop & others continued building places to have their meals on, all sorts of boards were brought in, some where doors which they made use as tables & pieces of Canvas from everywhere were put up for shade during the afternoon I had a rest & after I had Tea I took a stroll into the Town of Poperingie about 2 Miles away. Our Camp lies in about 100 yds from the Main Road. This Road is made of Square stones blocks & very hard to walk on, it is an everlasting Road & I believe it continues on to Brussels, as we are now some miles in Belgium the People all speak Flemish & we can understand them better than we did in France. The Traffic along the Road is very heavy consisting of Motor Wagons
