Tuesday Dec 14th We received a lot of patients in our ward to-day they were Tommies from Suvla Bay they say it is is terribly cold there and the frosts are awful.
Wednesday Dec 15th Had to journey up to St Andrews Hosp a distance of about a mile to see the Dentist. He extracted a tooth (a wisdom) but I may have to go up again. Nearly all the inmates of our ward are up now and consequently there are a lot of jokes I was the victim to-day my two eggs with my name on were blown the yolks extracted and the empty shells boiled. On retiring to bed I found my blankets sheets reefed.
