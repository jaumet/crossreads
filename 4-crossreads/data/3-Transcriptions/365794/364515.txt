<p>Tuesday 23rd April 1917 [1918]<br/>A khamsein blowing again &amp; during the lovely moonlight night some thunder &amp; a few raindrops.<br/>10.30 a.m. M.O. comes but the result is surprising.  "Really better where you are Sister for the present, one never knows where this diph. poison gets too or the results etc."  I agree as evidently he knows what he is talking about &amp; really the wish to get up is not great even yet, always a little pain in the cardiac region worries me &amp; I think my dear Father's failing is or will be mine also.<br/>11 a.m. brings C.O. &amp; troupe for "inspection".  C.O. more abrupt than usual, remarks that I've been in 20 days (not true), says it is a long time &amp; hurries away.  Thank God I can never be a Matron in the British Hosp.</p>
