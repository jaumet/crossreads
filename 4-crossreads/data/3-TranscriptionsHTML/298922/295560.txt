<p>Friday 7 September 1917</p>
<p>Cairo<br/>Again to G.H.Q. I may yet get away on Sunday next &ndash; but nothing definite.</p>
<p>[The remainder of the page crossed through.]<br/>Application granted for Dolly to come out so hope all will be well better the Winter in Egypt than at Home.</p>
<p>Am afraid I'm spending a lot of L.S.D. in all this but as we earned it, still I'm not helping at home much. I did think Jack would be paying interest to you all these years. Thank you for looking after Insurance.</p>
