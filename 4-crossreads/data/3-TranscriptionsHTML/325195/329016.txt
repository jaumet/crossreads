<p>22.11.15<br/>A heavy bombardment to the South of us this morning by the warboats; Francis made himself useful this morning by pinching enough wood from the beach this morning to last us a fortnight he is having his meals with us at present; Today has been about the  coldest I have felt for sometime <u>&amp; everyone is doing a shiver today</u>.</p>
<p>23.11.15<br/>Tue 23rd<br/>Another cold day, on duty from 6 to 10 am. Went to the Indian Gully &amp; scored a little flour from Mills &amp; put this afternoon in making jam tarts; We have been getting good food the last couple of days even cabbage yesterday: The Artillery has been pretty busy on both sides otherwise all quiet a little rain during last night</p>
