<p>Dull &amp; Showery</p>
<p>Walk miles looking for a sit down like a Gippo with his Water-Bottle. I sit in office write. Recd letters from Esme &amp; Maisie Hudson. Billiard Table mended. We have the riot by M.O.'s &amp; C.O. over Diet. We all come a gutzer. I have a row with Registrars.</p>

<p>F &amp; Dull. Rain 5 pm.</p>
<p>We admit <u>100 Patients</u>. I wash Hankeys &amp; clean up room. No musician &amp; I play all Dances. I am lonely 'cos Dick is absent. I walk Home with Doris &amp; Fassy &amp; Stupe. R.A.F.'s play Billiards in Mess. I go to Dick's flat &amp; write. Nice warm day which is quite a change.</p>
