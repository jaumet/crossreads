<p>9th Nov:-<br/>Work as usual. A train of wounded and sick from the front arrived at 1-30 pm   &amp; we are kept busy getting them into bed  This is not my first train. One arrived on Sunday &amp; it is a sorry sight. The long white train steams in    &amp; the stream of khaki turns out  some limping, legs, arms, eyes heads bandaged up. Others ill, enteric &amp; dysentery mostly. These men who go out some few weeks before fully equipped now return &amp; some have a few odd clothes &amp; kits, others have the clothes they stand in only. But all cheerful. "Hello Bill  How is it?" from a friend. "Good-oh" says Bill. War as it should be seen at home to make of few of the shirkers come along &amp;  give a hand.  I again visit Kasr-ly-ani Hospital with friend</p>
