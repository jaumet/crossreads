When returning to camp next morning which was Strike day, I got on the wrong train & was landed 8 miles the other way from Salisbury.  By walking & jumping A.S.C. wagons & lorries etc I got back to Sarum for dinner.  At 3pm I set out the other 11 miles to Bulford & by the same method of transport I got Home at 4.15 pm & just in time for Tea.  It was a nice day though the snows which had fallen the previous day still lay on the ground & I fully enjoyed a day from work & worry.
