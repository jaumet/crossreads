<p>There was a method however that certainly was smart in its simplicity &amp; was the means used by which we often got two of everything for the one price. Fat &amp; Charlie however always got tea &amp; cake for nix by this method. In outline it consisted of waiting until a crowd had gathered around the counter &amp; then in an indignant tone demanding your tea or coffee as the case maybe &amp; was usually followed by yes sir! Sorry &amp; so on! &amp; out came the food for nix.</p>
<p>The plates, knives &amp; other utensils however were absolutely caked with last meal's food but that does not worry after one week in camp. Our regular rations were eaten out in the open &amp; usually got covered with grass &amp; dirt but the food was good &amp; on Sundays we could get chipped spuds etc .Occasionally we could come the double on the tins of jam &amp; so on until we became thorough rogues but one is placed in such a position that one must do these things to make life happy &amp; bearable. Otherwise camp life is "Up to putty."</p>
