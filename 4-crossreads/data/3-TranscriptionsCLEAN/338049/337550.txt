  
 Friday 6 Dec. Up at 7 & after breakfast down to the wharf. In spite of great scheming could not travel on morning boat. 
 So knocked about the town instead. After dinner visited the wharf & finally got aboard & said goodbye to France. Arrived Folkstone & then London all right. Dug up Will, & Bert & put the night up with him.
