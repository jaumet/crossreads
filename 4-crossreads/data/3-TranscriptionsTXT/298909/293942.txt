6/4/16  Thursday
Rather a nice day. All leave still cancelled - Very few men left at Zeitouin - two brigades of L. Horse are to supply all the Guards picquets, I think they are going to remain here - rumour has it the 11th & 4th LH. will remain till the Anzac Police 2,000 odd being formed are trained to take over their duties. All N.C.O's were dismissed from all parades in our section - not enough men to go around. Talk about rag time guards etc., at 7.30 pm myself 5 Corporals & 1 Sergeant 36 men called out for guards & picquet, quite a good joke here AMC Picquet.
I had to report Garrison Orderly room & sign on, who to my surprise should be there as Orderly Sergeant but Billy Bedsor, soon
