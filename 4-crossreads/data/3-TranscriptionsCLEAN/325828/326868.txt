old Colonel has prohibited any more boxing or wrestling matches to be held.  The colonel (Col. H.V. King) is an old Australian bushman & is a fine old man.  He hasn't much manner delivery about his speeches, but he is an old warrior & is very well liked by the men.I have sometimes leaned over the rail at the stern of a night & watched the phosphorescence in the water.  It is a lovely sight & of course was quite a new & novel one for me.We have had extremely hot weather for the last week or so & everyone is appearing in the lightest of dresses.The Orsova is a lovely vessel & a splendid sea boat   We were indeed lucky to be appointed to her.  We have now been 10 days out of sight of land & have only seen 2 steamers during that time.  We have just sighted on starboard bow a smoke which is probably that of a transport that left Freemantle 2 days ahead of us.Two or 3 days ago I, in company with another chap who knows one of the engineers, went down the engine room & was shown all over the engines (twin screw) dynamos, board, & propellors.  It is truly a magnificent piece of machinery, & kept in splendid order.The meals have been splendid so far & I have always been ready for my tucker.  The supply of freshwater is running out & we are on condensed water now which is not half as nice as the fresh.
