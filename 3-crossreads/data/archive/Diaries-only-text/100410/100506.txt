(4) Killed in action 
What preparation can I write
To warn you of your loss?
To mitigate in black white
The burden of the cross?
These little things kept separate ?
His diary half begun;
How can these trifles compensate
A mother for her son!
The consolation men might seek
In knowing how he died
Seems so inadequate and weak
Where sorrow weighs down pride.
The Mother of all Sons bestow
All grace comfort, till
The bidding comes for you to go
Where men no longer kill!
 To "F.L.R." 26/4/15 In France 
You with the boyish laugh; the sunny eyes
That always smiled when danger threatened worst;
Would you have had things ordered otherwise
If death could be prevented, fate reversed?
You were so bright, we brightened ?neath your touch,
To all alive, your silence seems unreal.
Can it be true that you who felt so much
Lie there alone and can no longer feel?
O comrade, though maybe they call you dead,
To us who loved you, THAT you cannot be!
God grant when in my turn I too am sped,
Someone may find as much to say of me.
