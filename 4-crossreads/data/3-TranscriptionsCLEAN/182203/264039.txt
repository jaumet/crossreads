May 18th  1916 My dearest Jane, Really I am ashamed of myself at forgetting to write to you in time for your birthday. Anyhow I hope you had a very, very, Happy Birthday & lots of presents. Suppose Belle gave you mine - fancy I have been away for two of your birthdays now. I'm writing early in week, best begin when I have time. I wrote to Alice last Monday & since then have had rather an exciting time. Monday-night I received a wire from my  beloved  saying he was coming by that evening's train to say Good-bye  leaving for France next day. So I got dressed  & got a late pass from Matron, went to the station to meet him. Well, we had a sad but lovely time &  returned to the Home before 11. p.m.  Matron was awfully good   indecipherable all  to me
