<p>as a little extra. I was very sorry not to be able to get more photos on the Peninsular, I have been able to get a few here of old windmills etc. The shipping here is enormous, hundreds of transports and warships of all sorts and sizes, the camps ashore are of a size and number to fit, all around the bay are Camps as big as Liverpool. The Island is pretty thickly populated, small villages at short distances apart, most of the houses square built of two stories all rough stone work no plaster in or out and a shop in every house to catch the fleeting crop of soldiers money, strange to say their prices are reasonable the stock tinned stuff, figs, oranges, dates and a great variety of chocolates. Of course most of the chaps have plenty of money so the natives are coining money, its great to be able to get some fruit and a bit of different tucker.</p>
<p>We are not allowed to post letters for awhile and we all expect to go to Egypt so will post it there, we all want to go there its much to cold here for our liking.</p>
<p>We have done a little drill since we came here and the chaps are picking up their old form remarkably well, things naturally got a bit lax in the trenches. I felt a bit strange at first drilling my platoon or trying too, anyhow dont think I made too bad a show considering. Will write again in Egypt as we are not allowed to post letters here.</p>
