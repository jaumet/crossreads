<p>our surplus material,including our remaining blanket, we handed in this morning. Even the little medicine chest had to go&#151;-I kept what I could out of it. I have kept 3 prs Sox&#151;but no change of underclothing. We are, of course, under marching orders all the time*<br/>SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE,<br/>23/7/16.<br/>Haven't been able to finish your letter yet&#151;-We have b een hundreds of miles since I last wrote you. I remember, as though it were far off, instead of a few days ago, lying<br/>down on the gravel path of a big town from sheer exhaustion<br/>officers and men, we all did the same. We had been 12 hours in the saddle. Then,under the gun itself, anywhere when one is tired, we have slept. Every day the motor ambulances pass us, full of wounded. I have used my last green envelope. We have not had an issue for about a month, and I don't think we will see any more for a good while. Soon, very soon, that<br/>Sword of Damocles that has overhung me so long will fall<br/>that is letter-writing will have to give place to field p.c's. The officers have not time to censor them---even if we had time to write them&#151;-though we would try and manage that in odd moments.<br/>No, I didn't remember Mothers' Day---but I remembered my<br/>own Mother to send her a birthday card&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and strange to say&#151;<br/>it is the only one that has not reached her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.17.<br/>I will close&#151;as these few minutes are snatched after breakfast between shaving and parade, and time is up.<br/>The time is drawing very near when we shall all be returning.</p>
