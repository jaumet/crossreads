 Apr 8th - 18 At 4.30PM all packed up and nothing to do but loll about till 1-30AM at which time we commenced our journey to the Somme Several proceeded per horses while others used the boot leaving the remainder including myself to get a wriggle on per bike. 
 Our first stage was soon over as it only needed an hour to reach Hopoutre Siding where we had a cold wait for 5 hours before we began loading our gear, wagons etc
