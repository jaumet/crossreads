<p>for a time, but after a time you long for your own. Thats one thing when you are over the way fighting you have no time to think of anything.<br/>Bye the way I don't think I told you how elaborate some of the German dug out were. of course they were the quarters of the officers. One was thirty feet under ground, &amp; was made underneath exactly the same as an ordinary five room cottage. Lined with boards &amp; papered Side board chairs table &amp; all complete (oak) Sleeping room, double bed &amp; all sheets matress etc. Book cases, dinner set. Bath room Electric light You never saw the like.<br/>Of course they were taken from French homes &amp; they thought they were there for ever. But we have driven them to hell &amp; we'll keep on driving them. It is a fact their officers have to almost shoot 'em" to make them counter attack. They come in hundreds, but we keep them back &amp; mow them down like wheat.<br/>Hoping you are all well Love &amp; kisses<br/>Your loving Son</p>
