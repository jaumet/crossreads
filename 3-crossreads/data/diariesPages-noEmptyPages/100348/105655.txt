issue of whale oil into them; it make keep the icy slush out when I go out tonight. I am with a party that carries hot rations to the firing line twice every night. The food is carried in large steel thermo. containers, that we strap on our backs. We go straight across the open as there are no trenches, they are either full of water or have fallen in. The foul air here is putting my candle out.

Did two trips with the food "containers" last night. Fritz spotted us on the last trip and signaled his artillery with two green lights, got "strafed" very briskly for a while. The ground is covered with a frozen crust now. We break through it in places and sink to our knees
