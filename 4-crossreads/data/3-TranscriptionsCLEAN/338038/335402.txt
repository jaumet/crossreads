  
 75 No3 London Gen Hosp Wandsworth  12.11.17 My Dear Father & Mother, It is such an age since I put together anything in the shape of a letter to you that I hardly know where to commence - I am fortunately able to write without any difficulty tonight from my eyes, and think they are fairly on the road to recovery.        I have been keeping off letter writing as much as possible, but know Sis has been keeping you advised.  My first thought is to thank you for the most welcome letters of 23rd & 26th Sept just received - You can imagine how I felt getting them after all the weeks without a line.  Your last few despatches having been forwarded to the Battery and are now dribbling back in twos & threes - I do trust Father's injury
