<p>the other.  You may have seen Dr. Seede, from Perth, before now.  The windmills give Fremantle and the neighbourhood a something that I have not seen elsewhere.  The contrasts between one place and others, or some characteristics of a locality are what I look for.  Many writers of the first class have continued their good reputation by heading an account of a country by a catching &amp; appropriate headline, e.g., the late G.A. Sala styled N. S. Wales the "Land of the golden fleece", a title which the country deserved before but which no one had given it out loud, he struck upon something, in the same way, for each colony he visited.  Tabby would not have written what you might have had you sat at a table for half an hour each day with block before you and pen in hand telling me of the happenings of Australia and N. S. Wales in such manner as you would were I seated at the opposite side of the table from you.  It is thus my nib runs over the paper because it is my intent to chat with you, to give to you any information that has been stored in my skull &amp; that indicates its suitability, by coming as a thought, to be written.</p>
<p>What a gay theatre going lot you are becoming.  What with the Williamson's and the MacIntosh's you are in the very thick of the theatricle crowd.  The Niblo people have had a long run in Sydney, it might have been imagined, that the incidence of the war had made money so scare [scarce], as to preclude ordinary persons from spending <strike>money</strike> it upon shows.  The country must be a prosperous one wherein people can afford it.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoyed Jimmy Roach's ham.  Please tell him that were I at home it would have been done justice to by me.  He is a good boy to bring sweets, strawberries and the like to my Car, Joe, &amp; Kitty.  Buddie told me in her letter that you had sent to her goodies, which were much appreciated, for the Xmas time.  Her letter was dated 30-12-14, and took but 27 days to get here.  I hope that you have seen her.</p>
