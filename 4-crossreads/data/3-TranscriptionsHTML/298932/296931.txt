<p>Friday 6<br/>Fought a Tommy last night never got hurt thanks to my little tantalizing feet it is good fun for the boys<br/>Saturday 7<br/>I wonder, if the folks at home realize how monotonous this game is, it is very heart aching<br/>Sunday 8<br/>If you want to feel welched and lonely and sad come out here<br/>It is raining like hell I'm wet through and have nothing dry to put on</p>
