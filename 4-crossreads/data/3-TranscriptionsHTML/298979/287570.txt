<p>What a difference it would have made if all the time spent in useless Drill by Numbers (similar to raw recruits) in Egypt had been devoted to teaching every man to be a Machine Gummer &amp; bomb thrower.</p>
<p>During the night the continual noise was so great that ordinary speech could not be heard in the "open", and one of the men on sentry got quite annoyed at the efforts of a man in the bottom of the trench, to speak to him, as he said, in a whisper.</p>
<p>What are you mumbling down there for?<br/>What the deuce are you trying to say?<br/>Why the [dash] dont you yell out?</p>
