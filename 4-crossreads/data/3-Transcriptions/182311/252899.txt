<p>April 15th 1918.</p>
<p>MY DEAR ONES,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be very nearly a month since I wrote you anything like a long letter, although several times I&#39;ve sat down and scrawled to you the wish that all are well and the fact that I am well too.&nbsp; Yes, it has been a very busy time, quite a big task since the 23rd of March, when in some haste we left our pleasant rest billets in a happy sheltered valley <sub>^</sub><sup>Les Seninghem near Desvres,</sup> far from the war and started out to stop the advance of Brother Bosche, when the 5th Army were attacked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems the fate of our Division that our period of rest is never completed but is always curtailed, and the Division moves off to some scene of warlike activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the lads, the move came as no surprise for they were expecting a stunt, had been ever since a few days before they had been served with a ration of Australian Bunny.&nbsp; By some strange coincidence the Rabbit Ration quite uncommon as a soldier&#39;s food has always been issued before a &quot;stunt&quot; - it cames before Messines, before Passchendale, it came before some of our raids and just as soon as we saw it while in rest, well, we all knew what to expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And we were ready too, for the weeks in rest had been spent in organization, in training and in the full-est preparation, so that we were absolutely fit and prepared so that we would be fit for anything, mobile in the strictest sense of the word.</p>
