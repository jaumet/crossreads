<p>some march believe me. However I managed the walk alright, luckily our packs were carried. Avesnes is a fairly decent place, but the price wanted for such articles as postcards, &amp; writing pads etc. was absurd. I had tea with Bob Roberts of the Anzac Concert Party &amp; attended the show afterwards. The performance was a good one. The following day saw the last of our moving about, &amp; we marched to Sar Poteries, arriving there about mid-day.  It is a fine place to be billeted in, the buildings were modern &amp; the streets were clean.  It was a great relief to be away from the mud. Our billets are very comfortable without contradiction, the best the Unit have had since being in France &amp; the inhabitants, words cannot express our gratitude to them for their kindness to us. The Unit Post Office was in a comfortable little room, containing a stove &amp; a bunk, so I am set up for the Winter. The Madame who owns the place is very good to me supplies the fuel for the fire, gives me coffee in the early morning &amp; does all my washing. The most peculiar part of all this is that when I attempt to pay her for these kind acts, there is a row;  but of course I insist. There is no reason because the Germans forced these people to work</p>
