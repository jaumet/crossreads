<p>will write as soon as possible.<br/>This <strike>thera</strike> theoretical part of our work is as bad as being back at school again, but is very essential for good navigation, &amp; I am glad I am mastering it so well.<br/>I must close now, with love to all you dear ones at "Cairnleith."<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.<br/>P.S. I am enclosing 2 postcards of "Lasborough House" where we are at present quartered.  Formerly one of Englands "old ancestral Halls" it is really a fine old building and situated in very picturesque surroundings.  It is about &frac34; of a mile from the Aerodrome, &amp; when this letter is completed, we will be living right on the 'drome itself.<br/>Leo.</p>
