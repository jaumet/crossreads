 Complain. Do they treat their Prisoners any better (State account) As the life within this Camp wher allmost unbearable, a good few Internees preffered death than to remain inside the Barbwires. So 3 Internees cut the Barbwire surrounding the Cowpark at 3 p. m this afternoon  &amp;  made a bolt dash across the open fields to reach the bush at the Bakground of this Camp. The first 1 got through the wires suxcessfully, but the  third  second got entangled.

About 12 lighthorse Guards  &amp;  15 foot Soldiers went in full pursuit about 3 minutes after the Internee got through the Wire, so his chance to get very far wher remote. About &frac12; hour after 2 lighthorse Guards  &amp;  one Police Sergeant wher seen to lead him back towards our Camp. Every Internee pittied this Internee on his stiff luck, so he wher taken to the  lockup  Police Station  &amp;  charged theirupon placed in the lockup.
