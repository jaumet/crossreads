<p>June 1916<br/>1st &ndash; Colonel &amp; W.O. on seeing it was a Taube, cleared for redoubt on top of hill. Bob T &amp; I were together &amp; did not shift except to lie flat <strike>as</strike> when bombs fell. Not quite sure if I got photo of explosions of 3rd bomb or not. Heard a bomb hissing thro the air before I got view finder on it &amp; am not sure if I pressed lever or not. Time will tell. I fell flat &amp; Bob T. followed suit quickly. Saw first bomb leave aeroplane. I was the only one to try &amp; get snap. Large number of horses missing. Various reports say 100, 150 etc.<br/>2nd &ndash; Report saying that 100 of our horses arrived back at <strike>Salhia</strike> Pt Said. Don't believe it. Early next morning (2nd) we shifted camp about 300 yards further back. L.H. also scattering &amp; spreading out. Rather a severe lesson to them. Camp a good one but believe it to be only for a few days. Expect to be moving to Hill 70 on Sunday. Every thing cleaned up &amp; spic &amp; early in afternoon.<br/>2nd &ndash; Had a letter from Dave. Said he expected to go to Conv. home at Pothcawl in day or so. Letter dated April 19th Y.M.C.A. arrived at Romani day or two ago.<br/>3rd &ndash; Rumour re Taube being sighted at Qatia in afternoon. Regts stood to horses. New camp in good position.<br/>4th &ndash; Packing up early in day, preparing to move to Hill 70, replacing 1st L.H.F.A. &amp; they replaced us. Bearers left about 4pm &amp; we caught train leaving about 5.15. Hill 70 19 miles from Romani. Left kit &amp; equipment at stopping place &amp; had to march about 2 miles, mostly on formed road so good walking.<br/>5th &ndash; Found we had made a bad exchange. They took all, leaving nothing except a dirty camp. Dispensary &amp; Dentist running together in a QMs marquee tent. Heard about naval battle off the Categatt. British losing, Queen Mary, Invincible, Indefatigable (BC)</p>
