When you have finished it and any of your people who care to look at it, please pass it on to Dudley W. with my love will you? Fear we won&acute;t see any action now; hope we occupy German Islands before Japan &#151; cunning yellow beasts! They are after everything for nothing Love to Nell & Johnny Yours A . B. D.
