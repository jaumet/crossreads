<p>from Achi Baba. Some of the enemy's shells on the beach caught a number of victims this afternoon. A few were horribly mutilated.</p>
<p>Monday 28th [June 1915]<br/>I do not think I mentioned before that we now get fresh bread every 2nd or 3rd day. It is baked over at Imbros Island and sent across. Imbros Isl is only a few miles away and you can see it well from our firing line &amp; I can assure you it ids greatly appreciated. Last evening Corp Coleman &amp; I went for water but alas were dissappd as all that could be obtained was brackish owing a hole having been made buy a shell in the pontoon while coming in. On returning we had a moonlit swim. The moon rose a bit late and its silvery face smiled over the ridge above the beach just as we entered the water. It was charming to see the streams of silvery light reflected over the rippling ocean swell.</p>
