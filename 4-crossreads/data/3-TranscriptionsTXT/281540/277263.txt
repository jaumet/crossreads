13/11/15Quiet night our patrols could see the enemy working and others about they seem beggars for wandering about over the bullet swept ground.  A loud scream was heard about midnight so someone probably stopped one.  Dark dull day, saw crew busy on destroyer doubling up and down aeroplane passing overhead very fast.  Persistent rumours today that Lord Kitchener has been having  a look round but probably all furphey although it was officially announced he was coming to have a look at the Eastern front.
1766 bags of mail landed for the Army Corps.  We have message for fatigue so hope for some mail tonight.  Climbed up hill for exercise.  Two meal of a day racket is working well - tea after stand to.  Enemy quiet so far today.  Both our artillery & theirs taking things easy last few days.
1745 Now hear officially Kitchener was here two days ago.  New crater caused by mine the other day wants watching and machine gun is laid on it for tonight.  About 1700 some 75's knocking round and splinters nasty.  Had some fairly close.  Lamp alight at 1730  After "stand to" read Cawthorne having got commission Salmon took over RSM.  What responsibilities these youths shoulder to the disgrace of men who stay at home.  This youth of 19 is the Reg. SM of 1000 men and in attack is the key of the system that supplies every round they fire.  And look at Cawthorne and the other boys leading men in a life & death affair like this Drummond came up two days ago
