<p>22nd June 1916 <br/>Another fine &amp; warm day. Mess orderly for day. Full dress parade again. Another huge laugh. I did not get dressed anyhow. Nothing of importance happened. Night hot into the bargain.</p>
<p>23rd June 1916 <br/>Washing day. Day hot typical weather for Tropics I presume. "Marathon" dropped behind again. Our ship Cruiser &amp; the others slowed down at nightfall for her.</p>
<p>24th June 1916 <br/>Another day in the Tropics which was hot. Concert held in the afternoon somewhat a success. Auction sale held. Nigger's pups put up Two sold for &pound;2/3/-. Money goes to Mariners fund.</p>
<p>25th June 1916 <br/>Sunday today. Church Parade held in morning. A very hot day. Went on guard at four oclock as Telephonist. Did not spend a very good time. Passed the Line at early morning hours.</p>
<p>26th June 1916 <br/>Finished up guard at 4 oclock this afternoon after spending a hot &amp; tiresome day. Our ship behind all day evidently the old craft is feeling the pinch. Is gradually getting up to the other ships tonight. In bed early.</p>
<p>27th June 1916 <br/>Raining today &amp; very miserable. Otherwise very quite. Our ship still in the rear.</p>
