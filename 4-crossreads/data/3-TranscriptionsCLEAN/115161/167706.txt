  PRISCHES . 
 a small village where we stay for a couple of days then on to 
  SAINS . 
 This is not at all a bad town.  We sleep in "beds" here, and have very good meals, served up decently. 
 Huge factories are here, I should say that they at one time did exist, as the machinery and fittings have long since been removed by the enemy, who occupied this town for many months.  The whole town during his "tenancy" was practically used as a hospital. 
 In one big building amongst the straw and general muddle on the ground floor we saw legs and arms and various portions of the human body, which had been amputated, by which it would appear that - although we had always been led to believe that the organisation of the enemy was faultless, his systems perfect - here was one glaring proof of criminal neglect and wanton callousness.  Round about - both inside and outside - was evidence of studied filth, utter neglect of sanitary conditions and glaring callousness as to the health of the troops and civilians. 
 Our troops very soon put a different complexion on the whole place. 
 Explosions were frequent, the enemy on his evacuation would lay "delayed Action" mines along the railway lines, bridges, crossroads, and anywhere else where he knew we would have to travel in our advance, so that we still - although fighting had ceased - had many risks to run. 
 The populace are very pleased to see Australians, and they show their appreciation in the real French style, many of them. 
 While here I hear that many men are required at the A.I.F. headquarters in London, so I hand in my name, as I rather fancy the idea and am pretty sick of this country. 
 We stay here for about three weeks, during which time we have a real good "spin".  The people are very nice - many of them - and they do their best to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  I retain quite pleasant memories
