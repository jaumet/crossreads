<p>Dear Old Bill.</p>
<p>Mum has just gone to Church with Grandma I was going but I said I was not going and then Mum said that this was the only time so I said I was going but I ment to say go?  Bing is looking for <strike>fies</strike> flies he runs at them <strike>wen</strike> when he see them.  Frank and I have a little hut down in the bush we have not finished it yet.  I have 81 words in this without counting the date.  I am going to count up again.  We might <strike>think</strike> draw for you after if we have not anything to do.  I have X words now.  I am going to count up from the end.  Frank has got a lot of words done.  The Mother goat has her leg broken as Mum thinks I have not seen her this morning.  All the pretty little goats are getting on all right.  Frank is starting another page.</p>
<p>20.8.1918.<br/>I have best Writing today at School because Mr Collier gave us all new books to-day fore our best Writing.  I only had one mistake in Writing and Mr Collier said it was very good.  Frank was at home to-day and I had to go to school.  I was glad to get your letters when I came home from School.  Thank you for those little things from you out of one of the little French children's books.   I am very sorry that I have bad Writing and all the Blots is</p>
