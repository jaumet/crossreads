<p>10/8/18<br/>Guillacourt<br/>No orders arrived for any move of ours and we all had a good sleep in our bivouacs. With the company commanders and Stewart I left for a reconnaissance of the front line first calling at 5 &amp; 7th Bde. HQs where I saw the two Generals &ndash; Martin &amp; Wisdom. We then walked across very pleasant meadows that looked like anything but a battle field. Arrived at 17 Bn H.Q. I saw Col. Soulier and despatched the O.C. Coys. forward. After a yarn Stewart, Gorman &amp; myself pushed up into the village of Framerville which a few days ago was a German Corps H.Q. The railway line near here had on it a large train carriages &amp; trucks all the occupants of which were taken prisoner during the advance the other day before they could get away. On the railway here</p>
