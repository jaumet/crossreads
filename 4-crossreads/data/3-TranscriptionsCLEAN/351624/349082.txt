  
 Gas being heavier than cold air hangs to the earth. It remains in swamps, valleys and low lying country for a considerable time. With the aid of a light breeze it travels slowly, but rarifies considerably as it covers greater area. Getting away from our Camp was rather a difficult problem. We managed to evade shell fragments, though several of our number suffered more or less severely from gas. When a few chains from camp, met 4 men with a gas stretcher case. A fourth pioneer had consumed a fair quantity of liquor and was standing outside of his dug-out when a gas shell fell by him. Our stretcher bearers and others went to his assistance and managed to get him towards dressing station Just as first relief halted for a spell another gas shell fell close to them. The patients as well as  the  his attendants got the full force of this Took one handle of stretcher and did what I could towards hurrying patient forward. Ankle as usual went against me and another took my place. Before reaching party had a narrow escape two shells burst in an unsafe vicinity and a gas shell fell almost at our feet.
