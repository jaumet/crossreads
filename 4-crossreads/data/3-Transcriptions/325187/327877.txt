<p>1st L.H. Arrive 10 AM<br/>Busy fixing up Camp once more 120 in SHADE inside a Tent last week- but better than the cold.<br/>We can carry very little kit &amp; it pays to have a few articles of the <u>very best</u> quality only- the good PANTS.<br/> [Following paragraph is crossed out] My only regret is that I did not punch the Yeomanry Officers head.  They are mostly blue blooded Lords. No mails are to go to England or Australia for a fortnight<br/>Saw young Allanson today- &amp; many men that I have not seen for a long time.<br/>Captain of the day today.</p>
