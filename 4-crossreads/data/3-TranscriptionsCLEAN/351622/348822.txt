2 May 1916 TuesPitching large hospital tents very nearly all day which is another rotten job. Lieut Dacey brought in belonging to 16th A.S.C. Took charge of the officers ward. A good job only one patient. Adjourned to the estaminet several times through the day with Steve.
3 May 1916 WedGetting tent in order. Lieut Pearce comes in not too good. By cripes he says what would I give for a brandy & soda now. Several of the enemies shells fell within short distance of us to-day. Went to Steenwerck with Harry Benson tonight & called to see Lawrence. I thought the old barn would stop one to-night. Big shell.
