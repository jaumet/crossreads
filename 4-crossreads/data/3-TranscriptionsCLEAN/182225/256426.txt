 1916   FRIDAY 3   NOV. 
 Raining all day. We had a mounted battery drill in morning & I was lead driver on the Firing battery waggon. It was a bit of a farce & we were fooled about as usual in stables & harness room afterwards. The battery went on duty at night. I asked Campbell about a transfer to the R.F.C & he said he would fix me up all right.
