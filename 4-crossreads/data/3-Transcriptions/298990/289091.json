<p>Dernacourt 26/11/16  It was raining heavily early and continued until just before we moved out of Fricourt.  All hands got to work early to leave the huts clean.  Set off in companies at 300y interval for Dernacourt. My little horse very frisky and smart but easy to ride.  Road as usual crowded with all kinds of vehicular traffic and very busy.  The German prisoners struck one as being exceptionally ugly but their NCO's (who salute smartly) were alert and brisk looking.  Our Guards were thick in Meaulte and always turn out smart even on the dirtiest fatigue.  Our billets at Dernacourt were close and uncomfortable and all the Headquarters officers had to share one small room between them.  Padre Campbell (24th) stayed to lunch with us &amp; being Sunday our Padre had a service in the afternoon.  A poor uninteresting village this all muddy and with very few inhabitants.  News through today of bad days in Roumania &ndash; the Germans seem to do what they like. After tea had all the Company Commanders down and had a talk with them about different points  - chiefly the appearance and smartness of the men.  They get careless in dress and speech &amp; very familiar with officers as they come so much into close contact with them in the trenches. Laid down a programme for tomorrow.  At Orderly Room took a summary of evidence against one of the old original men on a charge of desertion. It is very noticeable that more men are deserting than formerly &ndash; generally good men too.  The old head has been through every stunt and seen his mates blown out each time and at last his nerve fails him and he disappears until after the battalion comes out.  A heavy penalty is then his.  Pathetic!</p>
