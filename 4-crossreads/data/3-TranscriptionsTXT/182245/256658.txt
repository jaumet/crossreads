 Fine. Owie Cadell &amp; I got leave 
 to go down to Vueuf Bequin 
 for the dayto see Laurie 
 Cadell. We spent the day 
 with him there &amp; got back 
 home about 10 oclock at night 
 Saw Les Tooth there, he is a Lieut 
 in the 49 th &nbsp;Bat machine guns. 
 We moved the Left section 
 to our new position by [Cinder?] 
 Farm. Fritz blew up a dump 
 just behind our line &amp; made 
 a hell of a splash.
