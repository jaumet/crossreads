SUTTON VENY CAMPThere's an isolated, desolated spot I'd like to mentionWhere all you hear is "Stand at ease," "Slope Arms,""Quick March," "Attention."It's miles away from anywhere, by Gad, it is a rum'unA chap lived there for fifty years and never saw a woman
There are lots of little huts, all dotted here and thereFor those who have to live inside, I've offered many aPrayer.Inside the huts there's RATS as big as any nanny goatLast night a soldier saw one trying on his overcoat
It's sludge up to the eyebrows, you get it in your ears,But into it you've got to go, without a sign of fear,And when you've had a bath of sludge, you just set to andGroom.And get cleaned up for next Parade, or else, its "Orderly Room".
Week in, week out, from morn till night, with full pack anA rifleLike Jack and Jill, you climb the hills, of course that's justA trifle."Slope Arms," "Fix Bayonets",then "Present" theyfairly put you through it,And as you stagger to your Hut, the Sergeant, shouts "Jump to it".
With tunics, boots and putties off, you quickly get the habit,You gallop up and down the hills just like a blooming rabbit,"Head backward bend," "Arms upward stretch,"  "Heelsraise." Then "Ranks change places."And later on they make you put your kneecaps where your face is.
Now when this war is over and we've captured Kaiser Billy,To shoot him would be merciful and absolutely silly. Just send him down to Sutton Veny, there among the RatsAnd Clay.And I'll bet he won't be long before he droops and fades away
     BUT WE'RE NOT DOWNHEARTED YET.
