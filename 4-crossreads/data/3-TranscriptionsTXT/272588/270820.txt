 Saturday 21 December Rotten weather, cold, windy &amp; wet &amp; there is not much to do in these parts. 
 Sunday 22 December Another visit to Charleroi, about 17 kilos away, partly walking, then on a Belgians cart &amp; thence by tram. The City on Sunday is very gay indeed &amp; the streets thronged with people.  Cafes, Cabarets &amp; Picture houses in full swing &amp; one, the Trianon caf&eacute; &amp; picture house, is very good &amp; typically continental. Place brilliantly lighted at night. However, coming home in the dark, wet, &amp; windy, night getting very wet, partly a pied, &amp; partly &agrave; cheval, was not too brilliant.
