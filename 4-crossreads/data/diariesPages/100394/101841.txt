Did nothing much today Wrote home and to Iris. On duty again tonight. They are plenty of broad and French beans coming along fine in the fields now and I noticed some of the boys with some today. The 8th Brigade Infantry to whom we are attached so far have proved a lamentable failure. This is the Brigade claimed to be the best that has ever left Australia.

August 6Had a cruise round on bicycle today looking for 15th Fld. Amb. but all the boys were away – I also had a look for Bob Prior and Clive Elliott but they were both away. There is some rumour of us going down to the Somme shortly. Business is fairly warm in that quarter I understand.

One or two aeroplanes have been brought down on either side lately, about two on either side I fancy. It’s a wonder we don’t lose more as about 10 of our planes go over the German lines every day and German planes are seldom seen over our lines.

I was up at 7.oo again today but had a very easy day of it. I have let the diary run down the last few days as it has been so quiet and nothing to mention. Our boys did some good work lately in Egypt and also on the Somme. I always seem to be in some part where nothing is doing but I suppose we shall all have a turn later Got 3 champions today
