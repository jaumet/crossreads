<p>24.12.16<br/>My dear Judge,</p>
<p>Your kind letter written some few months ago arrived last week, it had been following me round, as I had been away from my unit in a hospital for some days, only influenza, or rather the effect of working while ill with influenza, but it meant going back to the base &amp; there I stayed a fortnight.</p>
<p>I was interested in the legal news you sent me; the Sydney bar will seem strange when I return, many gone &amp; many promoted.  I wish some others would join us, I feel that some selfishness is behind some who remain behind.</p>
