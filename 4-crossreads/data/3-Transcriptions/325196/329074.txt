<p>1-1-16<br/>Sat 1st.<br/>Arrived home last night to find C.Sqd had been put on inline Picket, I expected to get into a row over being absent last night but it went along alright. This morning the sigs went out mounted &amp; did very little flag waving as it was our first ride for 8 months, some of the horse are more than half inclined to buck; I asked for leave this morning &amp; secured a pass from 2PM till 10PM &amp; was then told on stables that no passes were to be given as we were still on inline picket till 6 oclock; However I had arranged to go out with Arthur &amp; Bottom &amp; securing my pay &pound;10-0-0 while stables was on</p>
