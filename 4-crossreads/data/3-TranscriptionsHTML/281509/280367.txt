<p>Empire Day at home.  Wonder what they have been doing? Nothing special doing here  Fatigue work all morning  Bob &amp; self told of to Y.M.C.A. to clean up round about. Listen to band practice &amp; indulge in apricots &amp; biscuits. <br/>After dinner Bob Tony self &amp; B<br/>lake called out for stretcher party. Carry patient to road across railway, stiff work. Deliver him into hands of ambulance.  We visit graves of fallen then tour hospitals &ndash; outside.  Look at hospital train, every  comfort  Long walk. Home to tea. Go over to Market after then walk round beach, apricots &amp; biscuits. Bed. Caught glimpse of Arn. Beattie on march.</p>
