<p>when old Fritz opens a pretty heavy bombardment with every class of gun &amp; explosive he has, &amp; I can tell you things were pretty willing for the next couple of hour's, you could hardly hear yourself speak for the roaring, crashing shells &amp; bombs, most of the fire seemed to be on A. &amp; B. Coy. but we got the backwash of it, pieces of red hot steel &amp; iron were constantly digging in all around us &amp; the steel helmets saved many a man from a nasty crack, for these small pieces hit with some force, our guns especially the Belgian battery of 75's retaliated hot &amp; strong &amp; we had the last say, our guns were blazing away a good 15 min's after he had ceased fire I don't know what his object could have been but I think it was on account of our mortars they have been punishing</p>
