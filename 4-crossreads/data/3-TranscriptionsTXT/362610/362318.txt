 Wednesday 12 April 1916 Another cold wintry day with wind &amp; rain nearly all the time. In spite of the wet had the men clearing the furze &amp; scrub, then aligned the tents &amp; got them put up, this being a difficult job in the wind. About 10 o'clock the Victorian (2nd traing) Battn. came along. Hardly any of their tents were up &amp; the men had to cram into our tents while my party pushed on with the erection of our own tents on our allotted ground. This meant that the men had to move all their gear (&amp; themselves) in the heavy rain, &amp; it was hardly to be wondered at that next morning out of the 170 men in my company 43 reported sick. During the afternoon Major Short (Camp Q.M.) collared me to set out the ground allotted to the 3rd Bn., &amp; at this work I got soaked in the lower extremities, the cold rain driving clear thro' the putties &amp; running down into the boots. Was glad at 5 o'clock to knock off. At night a rum ration was issued &amp; hailed with delight by most of the men.
