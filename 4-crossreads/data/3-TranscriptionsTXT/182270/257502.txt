 WEDNESDAY, JULY 9, 1919. 
 Fine, but a bit cold. Jo drove me to 
 Pat Hurley&#39;s &amp; I met Eric &amp; Barney 
 Perkins there. I inspected 360 wether X 
 bred hoggets there &amp; bought them. Went 
 on to Barney&#39;s place on Round Island 
 &amp; inspected &amp; bought about 280 ewes 
 &amp; 155 wethers. Went on to Kickerbill 
 then, &amp; Jo brought me home. Saw 
 the Mackays &amp; Sy &amp; Laurence&nbsp;&amp; Grey 
 from Cattle Creek at Kickerbill. 
 Tickle round the Mountain and 
 at the fence at Boundary 
 well
