Wiesbaden
Frankfurt but the dismalness of the rain and the fact that the hour was afternoon put me off it. Walked down to the Rhine where a flotilla of English minelayers was at moorings. Met some of the officers and arranged to go up to Coblenz with them tomorrow on one of their trips. Then returned by train to Wiesbaden 45 minutes journey. Bought an opera ticket and then had a read until 6.30 when I went across and saw ?Aida" played. It was a splendid representation and I had a good talk to an old German who spoke English 5 other languages well. Met 2 American canteen girls and took them to dinner with us at the Palace Hotel. Afterwards yarned with them until after 11 oc.
