<p>28 June, Saturday</p>
<p>W.<br/>Awful gale raging. I get up &amp; do an hour's work. Lie down behind screen on seat all day. Dinner &amp; tea but I refuse pork. I read about mysteries of Marseilles. Go to bed after an hour's work at Tea time.</p>
<p>29 June, Sunday.</p>
<p>F.<br/>Lovely day. Cool. Gale ceased but huge swell. Breakages galore. I feel more safe &amp; work all the time. I write &amp; read Milton. Go to bed at 9 pm.</p>
