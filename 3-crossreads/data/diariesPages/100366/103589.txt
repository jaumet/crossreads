If this weather continues there will be a lot go out to it, & yet the O. have not got enough humanity about them to cut out [indecipherable] parades which are unnecessary. The worst features of this weather is the way it affects the feet. I had 2 pairs of socks on & then could not keep them warm.

There are many rumours about our next move, the 1st Division having already gone, but no one knows where we are going to. I went out to obtain some coffee this evening but the cold drove me in again & eventually l turned in only to lie awake all night with the cold.

I went to Oudderdom today buying green forage for Brigade Horses & on the way back passed about 200 German prisoners near the Divisional Baths where they had been treated to a bath & clean clothes. They were a very sorry looking lot & all appeared to be on the young side although it would be hard to accurately gauge their ages on account of the heavy growth of beard which adorned each ones face. They looked at us some winked & altogether seemed very pleased to be prisoners--. For them the war is over & until peace is declared they will be fed & clothed, not a bad position to occupy these times
