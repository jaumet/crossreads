<p>after dark. Blew one Tommy to pieces that was all so we were all very lucky.</p>
<p>Sunday 11.8.18<br/>All the 5th Div. went out to Fouilloy, Villers Brett &amp; Aubigny for a spell yesterday. We are still in &amp; this morning McGowan took his &amp; my platoon out to build dug outs for some Amb. people. If he doesn't finish by 4pm I have to take No 5 out to finish it. The 1st Div. took over from our people. Plenty of strafing this morning round the forward positions. One of our balloons broke loose last night &amp; floated down south. The "archies" had shots at it but didn't hit it. All the news today is good so far.</p>
<p>Found out that Dad Hether was near here, so went over in the evening to see him. Was goodo. He looked well &amp; is in charge of the Transport of the 1st F. Coy. He was in Bayonvillers. Coming home Fritz started laying eggs</p>
