stayed behind all night and let the Dr and the men go ahead with part of the stuff. The Dr is useless in a move. He just sits down and grins, it is not in him to be energetic. The others camped about a mile the other side of the Canal. The Canal is too wonderful to describe here. The immense defence scheme that has grown since I was here last.
Monday 15th
Waggons had unloaded all goods on to narrow gauge railway and then returned. To me the trouble started, my Maltese Cart had come down without horses, owing to having shaft harness. The transport sys and the energetic Colonel made me unload half of my stuff as it was too heavy. Then the pontoon bridge on the Suez canal opened to allow a transport of "war babies" to pass, so we had a very enjoyable swim in the canal, eventually we drew up along side a narrow gauge railway where all the Troops were aboard a miniature train. I went with the Transport across cruel desert (along the same route Moses came from Damascus) until we reached a spot known as Hill 70.
