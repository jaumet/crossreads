<p>and wherever we land. We are doing our work and instruction together and at present on night watch together</p>
<p>Our day is very much like another except that there has been a very distinct rise in temperature in the last few days. The wind has been following us for some time and that makes it all the hotter. Awnings have been rigged up over the exposed parts of the deck set aside for drill purposes. The lack of space makes it very awkward for instruction and exercise. The trouble is that the men live well, the food is excellent, and simply can't get the exercise to work it off. When we disembark and continue our field training they will be very soft for strenuous work. I hope the 20th Battalion Committee is flourishing.</p>
<p>With kind regards to yourself Dorothy and the Judge</p>
<p>I remain<br/>yours very sincerely<br/>W.P. MacCallum.</p>
