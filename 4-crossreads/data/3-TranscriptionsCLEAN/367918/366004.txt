 My dear Judge, Very many thanks for sending me a copy of the evidence etc in that case against the Terraces Hospital. I was much interested in it and of course feel that the finding was very hard on the nurses. 
 I know what it feels like to have a patient collapse - you dont consider anything in the world except how to restore respiration and until breathing is going on alright you give no thought or attention to anything else. I am quite certain that had I been in the Sisters place precisely the same would have happened. 
 I dont like to think how many times even in my short experience a patient has got wet in bed or on the table and I have never thought twice about the chance of any ill result - merely changing the bedding when every other thing had been attended to. And I think if anyone had come messing around while I was doing artificial respiration on such an errand as to see whether the patient was getting damp - I would perhaps have overstepped the bounds of polite conversation. 
 There still seems to be some unrest in Cairo
