<p>1917<br/>March<br/>Bridge tried to find the Commonwealth Bank.   We got mixed up for a while but eventually reached it.  I had my bearings by this time, and as I had a small YMCA map of London, used to find my way about by it.   We were near St Pauls so decided to have a look at it.  It is a very fine place but the outside, as in the case of all other big buildings was very dirty.   We went down into the crypt where many famous men are buried.   Sir Christopher Wren, the builder of the cathedral is buried there.   A small slab sates (in Latin) He who looks for a monument, look around &ndash; Si requiris monumentum, circumspice?   Lord Nelson, and Lord Wellington have large tombs there.  In any case, a long recital of tombs is wearisome and a guide book is always procurable, so I will omit the rest.   When we ascended again, service had just started so we stayed on.  I did not enjoy it, as the choir had the whole thing to themselves.  I started to join in, but people looked at me.   The sound of the preacher's voice echoes through the cathedral</p>
