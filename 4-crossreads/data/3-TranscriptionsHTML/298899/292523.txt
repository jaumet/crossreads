<p>strongly to check our advance further.</p>
<p>Tuesday night 16th Oct. The last stunt totalled 943 prisoners but we did not reach all our objectives. Had one train to load during the night it being late owing to large troop movements going on. Signs are not wanting that we will be shifting shortly, the Canadians now making their appearance. My Section has received something in the nature of a disaster only 5 men being left out of the bearers. Gas was the medium of destruction, those not wounded or killed coming under its influence. The enemy put over a large quantity of gas shells &amp; two dugouts which contained our men were affected with the aforementioned result, two of our officers being also affected. I saw the majority of them going through &amp; managed to go to the M.D.S. &amp; get their personal effects for them before they went on the train. This occupied my time until about 3 o'clock in the afternoon after which I turned in to get a few hours sleep before going on at night again.</p>
