<p>France 24.2.18 <br/>My Dear Mother.   On return to Bn. I found two of your letters and also Letter card waiting for me as well as a couple of other letters, one from Min and one from Overstrand, which I should have received before I left the Bn. for my leave.   When I left Overstrand, all the family were well.   Elsie of course was still away from school but looked well,   I had really good weather for my holiday, and so can consider myself amongst the lucky ones, I should have gone up to the Midlands to hunt up the Relations but lost a couple of days at the commencement of my leave, and I did not feel very much inclined to run about,   I fancy I told you in one of my Last letters that I went to the <br/>Abbey and St. Pauls, but was unable to see some parts on account of services that were in progress at each place.   When I arrived back on this side, I had to wait for a train at the port where we disembarked so got a pass out of camp and went for a run round, there was little to see in the town itself except dingy shop windows etc,   I saw some very pretty Brussels lace in one window and went in to inquire the price.   The good Lady in Charge informed me that I could have it for 200 francs, so I went on my way, but without the Lace.   Then we went down to the wharves to see the fishing boats unloading their catch of herrings.  There were boxes of herrings, baskets of same</p>
