<p>June 21 pass &amp; came down town about 5 pm. Had nearly reached the bridge when I met Fred Melraine, so we strolled through the town &amp; along the Prom'. Fred looks real well &amp; has had a real good time, but his foot will never be really better &amp; I expect him to follow me to Australia.<br/>Weymouth is rather a nice place, good Prom', fairly decent beach, plenty of girls, several bathing sheds, theatres, gardens etc &amp; - a white horse. But it cant come up to Coogee or Manly, &amp; there is no surf at all, just a few little wavelets. The kiddies</p>
