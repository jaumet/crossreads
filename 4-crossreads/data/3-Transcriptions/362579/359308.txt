<p>Officers to the famous Butt of Warlencourt. We have passed it often but walked all over it. Oh, it is a wonderful place   &amp;  will take years to get it right again.</p>
<p>Returned in time for Dinner 7 p.m. then I went for another walk with one of our own Medical Officers. Gathered beautiful daisies, buttercups   &amp;  clover. We walked for miles over the fields, where a few weeks ago the dreadful fighting took place,</p>
<p>The beauty now is the twilight. Left about 8 p.m.</p>
