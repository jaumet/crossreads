<p>General Plumner, who was in command of the Messines stunt visited our C.C.S. to-day.</p>
<p>We were formed up on parade and he addressed the men complimenting them on the splendid work they had done during the Battle of Messines. General .P. does not look like a general. He is a grey headed wears an eye glass, so neat and clean that he looked as if he was only fit for a glass case. He is a wonderful general. I do not think anything could be more wonderful than the way he conducted this latest stunt.</p>
<p>Everything was as if it had been worked to a time table. During the battle some of the wounded had only been <strike>lying</strike> wounded two hours when they were in our C.C.S. and being operated on. One C.C.S. was seven miles away from the scene of the fighting.</p>
<p>June 13th. Wed.<br/>Off duty to-day. Went a walk to Mount Noir along with little "Chick". The day very hot perspired freely.</p>
<p>In Bailleul square there is a large number of guns of all descriptions on exhibition. They had been captured by various battalions during Messines Battle.</p>
<p>I noticed one of them was marked to be sent to Parramata. It had been captured by an Australian battalion</p>
