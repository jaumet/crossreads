  
 What Price Conscription Hospital 3     Nov 16 My dearest Sister, Just a note to wish you Ralph & Beres a Merry Xmas & a Happy New Year. I hope we are all together for the next one - did I thank you & the Mater for cabling on my birthday. I am getting a board tomorrow so will start on my furlough next week - so by the time you get this I will be back with the Bn. & hope my past good luck continues & I pull through. Owen called here to see me, he looks very fit & gave me all the Sydney news. Well my dear Sister wishing you the best of health etc. for the coming year, your loving frere Ken
