Jock found him raving mad I don't know what he was going to do, I thought once or twice when the Guard was mounting that Jock was going to tell "him off" or hit him over the head with a rifle for he was getting as red as a turkey cock it would not take Jock long to do it either for he don't care whether it is a Colonel or a private Jock will have his say.
We both decided that tomorrow we would be paraded to the Colonel lay our case before him


19th Have had a fairly easy morning, there was no early parade, but the men had to wash all the huts out clean things up. This morning when I took my "parade state" down to the orderly officer (Lieut Peel) started smooging to me the crawling swine trying to gloss over yesterdays affair, started off by saying that the time before last H Coys Guard was terrible, a lot worse than the one we mounted


last night, I can understand now he said why they were a little dirty (a little mind you after what he said yesterday) for they had been out on the range all the morning they should not have been, look here Mr. Peel I said I have no further wish to discuss this question with you in reference to the Guard as a matter of fact I have been more used to mounting sentries in the trenches, where a good few more ought to be, with a big emphasis on the 


ought, this shut him up In the morning though later on while Capt Pearce was inspecting the lines he sent the Batt. Orderly Sergt up to me to give me the tip to have my lines clear for old Pearce was blowing them all up, so he is trying to square me, but he I will never agree if he gets snaky again I will ask to be paraded to the Colonel state my grievances to him ask to be relieved of my duties I'm full up of being bounced about by these men who have never seen a shot fired in anger.


Parody on Advance Australia Fair
Twas on the 25th April
In the year of 1915
We landed down on "Anzac"
And many sights were seen
We bravely bore the shots of "Beachy Bill"
Although he scored some hits
And with a mighty shout we charged
And gave old Abdul fits.
On the 18th day of May my lads
The Turks made their attack
But we were not caught napping
We flung old Abdul back 
7,000 Turks were slain that day
A vile stench filled the air
And we heard one another shout
Advance Australia Fair
Twas on the 6th August
We captured "Lonesome Pine"
We shelled them for an hour or more
And charged on their front line


Anyone finding this little book will they please forward to the following address

It was a glorious charge my lads
The first of the lot
And the honours of the day my lads
Were with the 1st Brigade.
So now we've left old Anzacs shore
And will go back no more
We sneaked away at dead of night
Farewell to Anzac's shores
We failed to get old "Beachy Bill"
We failed at 971
So now we do not know my boys
If we have lost or won.
