 Thursday April 6th. Move off again with 5 camels loaded with medical stores etc. for A Section, a distance about 4 miles away.  (See photo). By some bad arrangements we were ordered to move off at 11 a.m. just in the hottest part of the day again. The sweat poured out of us. The camp is situated about 1 &frac12; miles from the end of the road, so naturally more of this cursed sand to trudge through. Arrived at our destination at 2.30 p.m. when we enjoyed some good hot stew. A nice quiet camp but unfortunately very little water. 
 Friday 7th April.
