Febuary 191726th   Orders came from H.Q. early this morning that we are to discontinue with the Anti-Tank Gun Position as the scheme has been cancelled for the time being.This afternoon I carried on with the remainder of the section, on repairing the and duplication of the "duck walk" tracks between Needle & Rose Trenches.  Nos. 1 & 2 Sections were put on to advance road construction this morning & are to continue with it.28th   I am still on the same job with the "duck walks."  Last night we had the Gas alarm.  At midnight we were woke up & informed that Fritz was sending over gas.  We got our helmets on & I fell asleep again, but very little of it came up here.
