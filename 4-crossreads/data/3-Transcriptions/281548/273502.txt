<p>had a soft bed &amp; woollen quilt.</p>
<p>Oct 18th  Not much doing &amp; the guard had been reduced because of the apparent impossibility of escape from the Barrack Yard 90 square yards in area.<br/>Our own folks were allowed to cook &amp; do for us.  The food was much the same tho allowed a little extra flour.  No tobacco &amp; no money to buy extras, so the authorities allowed <strike>us</strike> forage parties of 30 at a time out to do shopping<br/>Things were very cheap vegetables plenty for small sum chicken 4d. Turkeys 2/- each (One chap said he knew a Turkey that wasn't worth a damn let alone 2/- he was prepared to give it up any old time.)<br/>Weather was fine but v. cold.</p>
