<p>Friday 21 September 1917</p>
<p>Alex:<br/>Still waiting.</p>
<p>Went for a long walk to an old fort built before even the Romans came, I'm not much at Antiquities but these places are of interest. Alexandria is a very old seaport of the Mediteranean. Two boats little one went today but only <u>duty</u> men go in them <strike>on duty passengers have to wait.</strike></p>
<p>Yesterday was the Italian National Fete day &amp; Bands etc. occupied the Streets. We went to the KURSAAL &amp; saw TROVADORE by Italians. They are a handsome race of people.</p>
