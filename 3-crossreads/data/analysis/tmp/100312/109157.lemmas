 9/11/17 Calai Had a fair comfort abl night and slept sit up . The countrysid look veri green and comfort . Truck of sugarbeet go from the side . Reach Calai about noon and then sent a signal wire for the mess cart to meet me at Poperingh at 6 pm . Calai is to all appear the most bleak and uninterest of coastal town and Belgian and Flemish ( peopl dull of featur and of tongu ) infest it . In Rome and other part of Itali notic the manner in which the cloak is thrown over one shoulder in an envelop fold instead of be allow to hang down . About all these peopl retain of the ancient grace and digniti of the toga ! Had lunch at a littl place close to the station which was not so well patron as upon my last visit here . Left Calai at 1.20 and had an unev run to Hazebrouck where chang train for Pop . Ran into Poperingh at about 6 o'c and there found the messcart wait . Enemi
