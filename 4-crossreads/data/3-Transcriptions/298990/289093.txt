<p>Dernacourt 28/11/16  Foggy nearly all day.  Busy cleaning up for inspection by General Legge.  Found "A" Coy bad but all the other companies were good but still far removed from what one would like.  Walked round ranks carrying walking stick and looking severe passing stern remarks about a little rust here and some mud there.  Private Billjim gazed straight ahead like the good soldier he is , but one could see the old dear Australian "don't care" look and a waggish gleam at the back of his old eye.  Billjim reckons ceremonial and frill are undemocratic and not much good to him.  Still "it is the Army" and the old chap tolerates it.  I chuckled when going round to see old Charlie Sawyer's funny old face grinning straight ahead.  Had all officers up for a pow-wow before tea and discussed many points with them not the least being that of the allotment of leave.</p>
<p>29/11/16  All up early and parades fell in at 8 am a very cold sharp morning.  After  final inspection by their officers at the billets all marched to a parade ground just outside the village and were there reviewed by Major General Legge.  Formed up in mass with transport and other details in rear.  Waiting was a cold job and I let the men pile arms and walk about.  After the parade was formed up they did some marking-time and son on to keep themselves warm.  Reviewed the GOC with the general salute and then went round with him.  He pounced on some dirty pouch ammunition and we also found that the boots were in a very bad condition and leaky.  Any other points I bluffed off hard.</p>
