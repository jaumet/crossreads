27/1/18 London
Up and walked to St Margarets Church Westminster. The streets crowded with soldiers ? many Colonials among them. The old church soon filled. Over the altar is a plain crude window ? stained glass would be better. Canon Carnegie officiated. Cleared out before the sermon and made for the R.C. Cathedral. A gigantic place of red brick and as ugly as sin ? perhaps by the time all the interior is faced with marble it may begin to resemble St. Peters Rome. A priest preached an excellent sermon Mass followed but was disappointing as there was no music. Dined meatlessly at the hotel and then trammed and bussed to Wandsworth hospital. All the world and its wife out this afternoon. The little kiddies are amusing. At the hospital saw Thwaites and Woolf. The place is like barracks and the missing legs and arms are pathetic. Got back to Victoria about
