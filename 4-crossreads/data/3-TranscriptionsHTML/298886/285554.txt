<p>preparations with feverish haste out in front of us and that we can expect attack soon. Let em all come &ndash; the sooner the better and I sincerely hope they have a fine day for it.</p>
<p>9th June Fri 1916  Romani.</p>
<p>Signalling today these recruits of mine are capable of doing station work which is wonderful progress. Took some compass bearings of different points and also some panoramic Sketches</p>
<p>The latest - The whole division moves out at 4 oclock tomorrow morning to go out ahead we may be away several days We are going to harass the enemy again. But the Australians are in front this time instead of the New Zealanders who were out in front last time and did the killing. Reveille at 2 oclock. Breakfast at 3 oclock and everyone to be clear of the Camp by 4 oclock <u>We</u> carry 4 complete visual signal Stations also one telephone and 2 reels of cable  We are out every morning at 3 but tomorrow it will be 2 for a change. The 2nd Brigade back 15 miles at Hill 70 move up in support of us. NO signs of "Jacko's" man-bird lately but we can fully expect him after this "Stunt" again. Experts</p>
