 Saturday 28 
 Very busy day today as usual. 
 Finished stocktaking above & below & have handed completed lists  to Lt. Col. [indecipherable] who was pleased with them. 
 No rest for 16 hours. 
 Had a few minutes off in the evening & attend the final of the box up. 
 News received of victory in the Baltic Sea; 6 German cruisers sunk by Russians & one dreadnought by British submarine. 
 It is wonderful & what a difference this news has made in me for I have lost the tired & weary feeling completely
