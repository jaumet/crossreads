<p>My dear old Alice,</p>
<p>I have sent another parcel this morning to mother (2nd), hope they both arrive safely.  No doubt they will take longer than this letter.  I sent the third Kimono, so you must agree amongst yourselves which to have.  I bought a pink one for myself.  I've had them &amp; the shawl &amp; mummy beads some time &ndash; thinking I would bring them home with me, on transport.  If I get a day in Cairo before we leave I shall get some brass ware.  It is very hard to get anything for little Eddy, hope he likes the Egyptian Dagger.  It is the kind used at Kartoum.  A mail closes in the morning so thought I would just send you a few lines. I wrote to mother two days</p>
