<p>(cont) Sat 6th Apl.<br/>Lots of Irish, including two padres (Fitzmaurice and Casey.)</p>
<p>We formed fours outside and were marched to the lager &ndash; a collection of wooden huts inside much barbed-wire in a corner of the Stadtgarten.   There is a decent-walk under a avenue of chestnuts, but no room elsewhere.   One hut is a mess-room, another is an amusement-hall &amp; boasts two billiard tables, a library (French and English), a piano, &amp; a curtained off stage.</p>
<p>The sleeping huts are divided off into rooms containing about 8 camp-beds &amp; 2 wooden tables.</p>
<p>Everything is very clean except the mattresses, which are filled with wood-shavings and are alive with vermin (assorted.)</p>
<p>Orderlies, of ones own nationality, are provided for English, French, &amp; Italians.</p>
