<p>I done a very foolish thing when I walked on the station at Paddington.  I saw a bunch of "Mothers Pets" (Military Police) pulling the chaps up &amp; then I never tumbled but walked right into them.  Of course they wanted to see my pass.  I took my pocket book out but could not find it, so he said oh never mind Sgt. your name will do &amp; I fool like gave him my right one.  I never jerried till I had done it &amp; then I felt inclined to kick myself for I could easily have given him a crook one.  Our time was up at 12 &amp; we should have been back in Camp.  The funny part of it was that practically all the lads fell into it the same way as I did, but it don't worry us in the slightest.</p>
<p>30th.  Arrived back in Camp at 10 this morning &amp; found quite a few more of the old lads there from different places such as Weymouth Warminster Tidworth &amp; etc. but still no news of our moving.  This waiting is getting a bit sickening &amp; I for one am fed right up to the neck &amp; further if possible.</p>
