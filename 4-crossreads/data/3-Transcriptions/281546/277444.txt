<p>As it was good weather I slept very well only being disturbed by the Lads coming in by an early Leave Train from Belgium once, so at 7 am all hands were up &amp; rolling up the Blankets and returning them to the Store, we paraded at 7.45 for Breakfast, having a large number of men going on Leave, I mist the first serve and had to wait until 8am when I managed to get a seat and had a Piece of Bacon, Tea, Bread &amp; Butter &amp; Jam, At 8.30 we were paraded and marched off to the Boat, which was only about 10" walk. On reaching the entrance to the Wharf we passed through a Turnstile where our Passes were stamped and away along the Wharf, receiving two small Buns each for the voyage, and then down underneath showing our Passes again and receiving a card to put our Name &amp; Nos &amp; so on to be handed when coming off the Boat, Once on the Boat, each man was handed a Life Belt, for the Voyage, and made ourselves comfortable for the Trip.
