Moved on closer to the water at El Arish, my Tent faces the sea & the Railway runs past the door - quite suburban. I found my horses FAT & well.
Such a surprise from the POST OFFICE. Many Papers from YOU & also the HOUSEWIFE at last, it is such a beauty, with everything a man wants, also DAYS sleeping SOKS - I just had the old ones washed. New ones I will keep. 4 PARCELS altogether 2 from DOLLY & another from YOU & DAY with PLUM PUDDINGS etc. chewing gum also have now arrived PAPERS from the wife.
