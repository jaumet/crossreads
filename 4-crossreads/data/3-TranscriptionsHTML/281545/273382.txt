There were only a few lads in the Compartment when we left at 9.27 on Time but when we arrived at Abeele the compartment soon filled up, we made a good run to Hazebruick when I detrained &amp; reported myself to the R.T.O. at 11.am &amp; was told to report at 3.30 Pm as my Train for Steinwerck would leave at 3.55 Pm.   I decided to go for a stroll until Dinner Time, I went along to find the place where I had previously a very good dinner.   After making inquiries at a house I was directed to No 64 in the Street facing the Railway Line.   I had forgotten the number when I was there last, but soon was in the right place,   The Lady remembered me &amp; I ordered a hot dinner for 1 Pm &amp; in the meantime I took a stroll through the streets as the Lady told me that they had been bombarded lately.   The first shop damage I came across was a Paint &amp; Paper Shop, the Shell came through the Roof &amp; through the top floor &amp; ground floor &amp; exploded in the Cellar blowing the Paint Tins Paper &amp; Furniture all up in the air making an awful mess, everything was mixed up with Timber</p>
