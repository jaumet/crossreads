<p>5-6-16<br/>German boats were sunk.  This morning Les heard rifle &amp; machine gun fire on the coast to the north east of camp &amp; as a patrol of one Corporal &amp; 8 men had not returned he reported it to Brigade &amp; received some very sarcastic remarks from Major Chisholm for his pains.  Chisholm told him he had noises in his head but a Sqd of 2nd Regt were sent out to investigate &amp; found it was the infantry at practice</p>
<p>6-6-16<br/>Tue 6th<br/>This morning Les reported Major Chisholm to Major Granville who said he would take the case to the Brigadier &amp; that Les had done right to report as he did;  Fatigues are very constant here &amp; a man is lucky if he does not get a turn twice a day;  &amp; today trench-digging has started to consolidate the night outpost;  This morning a Taube came in as far as Qatia scouting;  Tonight C Sqd goes on outpost duty at 6 oclock</p>
