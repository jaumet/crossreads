Started off at 8, Nos. 2 & 3 going & other sections coming up in morning.  Marched about 3 miles nearly on to job & found we weren't wanted so went back arriving about 10.30.  Good few planes up and 11 bombs dropped about 400 yds from us on some batteries.  Passed some captured 5.9" on way.  Bed after some supper at 11.  To move at 4.15 in morning forward and reveille at 3.30.  Slept well.
23.8.18Up at 3.30 and had breakfast.  Barrage started at about 4.15 and we marched off about 4.30 after waking Bailey.  Marched same track and camped in front & on right of Morcourt & Mericourt in an old French trench near a copse.  Settled there and I was left in charge.  Sarre, Groth & Jensen & Robb gone out to see some new work at forward Brigade & also 16 men for a big job.  Got cooks gear over and only about 5 left.  Shovels very short and I started digging an open air place, level for sleeping in trench.  Dinner at 12 and party came back as job cancelled.  Got to work on dugout and very warm & extended it.  Standing to wait for work.  However nothing much doing so after tea went down to river and got some drinking water and had a good wash.  Some material up so on return set to work and made a rough cupola dugout after some argument about style.  Finished about 10 and to bed fairly comfortably and slept well.  Fine day.
