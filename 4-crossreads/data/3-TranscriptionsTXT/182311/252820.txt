up. "Who is it?" he asked?  Raybould, one of my scouts said "Mr.Peters," and then that sigh, I don't think I'll ever forget it, it was wonderful what expression that man (Private Ball) put into it.  Enough of that, I know I did a good job, and God was good enough to let me bring my lads through unharmed, and though I didn't do anything very wonder-ful, still it was a clean honest job.
   During the night of search, and after I had sent the wounded man in, the General sent a message to one of his staff Officers waiting in the trench, and I got the message and posted it home addressed, I think, to my sister. I'm rather proud of it.  This bit of a job is by no means excep-tional though quite distinct from our ordinary work in the trench.  Don't talk this all over the place, but you can let a few of my best firends know and tell them I'll fill in blanks on my return.  The boys who went with me are proud of themselves and their Officer and it has given me extra-ordinary standing in both "A" Coy and the regiment.
   I'm very well, and altho' the weather is always cold and sometimes very wet, I've kept my health.  I had quite a narrow escape the other day from a wound, when a shell fragment struck my pipe from my mouth, marking the pipe, shak-ing up my teeth, but otherwise O.K.
   All for the present.
      Best wishes
         HAROLD.
 
C.H.Peters.
