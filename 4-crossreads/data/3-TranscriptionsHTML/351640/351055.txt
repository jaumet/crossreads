<p>As we looked out from the deck across the sea, many ships were in view, some making for Mudros Harbour, a hospital ship flying the French tricolour followed a large P. &amp; O. ship, each hoping to pass the nets before the gap will be closed. Small war ships move North &amp; South no doubt patrolling the water on the look out for enemy submarines.<br/>The stewards are busy laying the table for tea.</p>
<p>The Seik soldiers wear large turbans.</p>
<p>The Ghurka wears any old thing as a head-dress, cap of wool, hat of felt. Each has a small pack in his hand or on his back. The latter has the facial appearance &amp; the almond eyes of the Chinaman.</p>
<p>We should be at our destination about 8 p.m. Wonder shall we land tonight, and if so where shall we sleep. Where?</p>
<p>I wrote the names on the photographs, placing near them the place &amp; date Mudros 15-10-15: You may some day read the entry.<br/>Have just been thinking how silly it was of me not to have left a telegram in Alexandria, to be sent this week end as a birthday greeting to Kathleen. Please tell her that I am very sorry!</p>
<p>6 p.m. Have just finished walking the deck with Jerrom. Well warmed up before the evening meal which is to be at 6.30 OClock. During the walk we talked nearly every moment of You &amp; home. I told him that of course you sent word to his people that we were coming this way</p>
