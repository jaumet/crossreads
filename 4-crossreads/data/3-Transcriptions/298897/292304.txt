<p>Wednesday 28th June.<br/>Slept up on deck for the last night being called up at 2.15 A.M.  We had breakfast our last meal on the ship all being on the wharf by 5 A.M. the ship returning immediately to Alexandria.  The local residents all had the Gippy sayings off by heart, such as Sieda, eggs acooked etc. &amp; greeted us with them with great glee.  Bread, buns biscuits, oranges &amp; such things were on sale, by women &amp; boys.  We entrained that is the whole shipment of about 1500 in one train of 39 carriages, the carriages being small tho' comfortable.  The sergeants were fortunate on having a second class compartment &amp; only five in each which allowed us sleeping room.  Wet weather greeted our arrival &amp; we wended our way through mud for a short distance.  Our route lay along a section of the coast, the line passing over several viaducts &amp; through long tunnels, splendid views greeting us everywhere.  It was good to see homes again with their gardens attached &amp; youngsters playing in them.  Tile works were fairly common &amp; practically all houses had tile roofs throughout the country they evidently being very cheap.  Thatched roofs did not appear until we were well past Paris,</p>
