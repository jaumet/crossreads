Thursday 3 July 1919Rained in the morning. Went to Earls Court & got my cake then to Maries flat. She wasn't in but waited till she came. Got told off for not writing & telling her about the engagement. Through speaking so long to her I missed a train to Brighton. Got one half an hour later. Janet met me at the train. We walked a bit & then went on to the Palace then till it was time for my train. My lip is improving. Gee it is some sore tho.
Friday 4 July 1919Fine today. The car broke down whilst I was having my lesson so went into town. Booked seats & a table for dinner for tomorrow night. Met Bill & George at the bank & had lunch with them. Took a couple of photos. One of Aussie House & a couple of Trafalgar Square. Planes were flying about dropping leaflets advertising the London [indecipherable].
Met Bill again & had dinner at his place & then we went out to Marie's. Left early tho & took George to the train & then came home.
