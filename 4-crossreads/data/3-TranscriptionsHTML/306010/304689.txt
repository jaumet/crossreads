<p>I think I was the only Australian in Paris during my short stay and was of course of great interest where ever I went &ndash; one lady wanted to take me for a Spaniard &ndash; I have been an Italian, New Zealander &amp; Canadian and also as an American as well. I only saw one Italian officer &amp; two Russians in Paris although there were plenty of Belgians who now seem to be all over France.<br/>On Friday 27th at midday &ndash; after reporting at the Brit. Mil. Police office, I took a <strike>train</strike> taxi to the Gare du Nord and left Paris at 12.35, going through Beauvais and Alancourt to Le Trefort on the coast and then through Abbeville, Noyelle, Etaples &amp; Boulogne to Wimereux where I arrived at 9 p.m. after a most interesting &amp; enjoyable six days on leave in</p>
