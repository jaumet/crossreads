<p>Red Cross letterhead as before<br/>Bulford<br/>26/8/17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>It is just 2 years To-day that I enlisted.  I feel O.K. &amp; I hope that I have not another 2 years to go.  I am just now answering your letter of the 16th &amp; 26th June.  I wrote last week &amp; told You all about my second Trip to Manx Land.  The Day after I returned Ellis set out for the Hielands of Scotland.  He &amp; Dave return on Tuesday.  Quarter Williams &amp; Frank Hennessey are still with us as is Lt Col. Grigor too.  Ern is still with us &amp; Billy is at Rollestone.  Young Milton Townend was over to see me To-day.  He is still attached to the A.M.C. at Park House.  So Laura Cuneo runs down often to see You now.  She is a bright little Girl.  Many a lark we have had to-gether.  And Dad, what if we do go to France.  We are just as safe in France as we are here unless we go stretcher bearing.  Well Ellis &amp; I will not have to do that.  We'll have to take risks with the Boys but Good-life we can be Soldiers too.  But, all the Yarns about France are mad.  When all the Australian Troops leave England then our Hospital will go to.  It is not possible to do that for many months yet &amp; any month may see Germany crying for Peace.  I have no taste for Poultry Dad.  We had a lovely duck killed at Auntie's place but I told Her to give me the roast Beef.  Uncle carved &amp; gave Marie a great big leg.  She ate all the meat but left a lot on the Bone.  She is much too nice &amp; dainty to pick it up in Her little</p>
