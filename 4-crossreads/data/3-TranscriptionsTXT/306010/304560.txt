 Australian base camp and a full two hours run in the train from Cairo &ndash; off the Delta on to the desert. Fixed up some transfers with the 5th Field Ambulance &amp; then visited a chap at No 2 Stationary Hospital, AAMC. Arrived back in Cairo at 8.45 pm. The camp reminds me of Mona only it is much bigger &amp; extends alongside the railway line for a couple of miles &ndash; plenty of bustle &amp; activity of course. The old 1882 battle-ground of Tel &ndash; el &ndash; Kolin (Arabic for "big plain") is just at the back of the camp. Feb 9" Wednes. We have been having a good deal more rain this  year  winter than last. I see from a report issued by the Physical service of the Ministry of Public Works that during January the rainfall was 130 per cent above average over the coast &amp; 85 per cent over the Delta.
