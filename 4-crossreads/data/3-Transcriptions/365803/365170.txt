<p>July 17th</p>
<p>We sailed from Porto Granda at midday of July 9th,   &amp;  almost immediately our boilers commenced leaking.</p>
<p>Fresh water was again becoming scarce, when we received orders to leave the convoy   &amp;  make for Madeira. On the evening of July 13th we arrived at the most beautiful little island imaginable.</p>
<p>An old fashioned town on the water's edge running right back   &amp;  up into the hills behind, where the houses become fewer   &amp;  fewer   &amp;  the vegetation more green. Vineyards are dotted everywhere,   &amp;   from where we were, they appeared to run in terraces one above the other till they merged into a beautifully fresh green.</p>
<p>We took in fresh water   &amp;  coal   &amp;  left on July 15th at 11 am. Once more we are travelling on our own but expect to pick up a destroyer shortly. If all goes well we should be in England in two days. Love to all   &amp;  cheer  up!  Your affectionate son</p>

<p>P.S.  I received a telegram at Albany;   &amp;   a cable   &amp;  letter at Capetown.</p>
