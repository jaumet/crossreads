 Mail day.  Got letters from Frank &amp; mother. 
 Saturday 12th My birthday.  Was feeling right again this morning.  Went down to the beach &amp; had a swim.  The water was pretty cold.  Chauncey got sick &amp; it is feared he has typhoid.  He went away probably to Lemnos.  The Turks put in a good deal of shrapnel in the morning but knocked off about 10am, our batteries must have been making it to warm for them.  Had yarn with Capt Robertson this morning &amp; scored a few envelopes off him. 
 Sunday 13th Fine warm day, very quiet.  Howlett got sick &amp; went for a few days spell.  Relieved C Company.  Went into the trenches at noon &amp; came out 6am.  Received letter from Carrie. 
 Monday 14th Had a good spell during the day.  The Turks put in some big shells today, but they didn't do much damage.  Was on fatigue at night digging. Tuesday 15th Went into the trenches at 6am.
