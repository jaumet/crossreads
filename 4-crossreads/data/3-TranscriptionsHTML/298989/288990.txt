<p>19/2/16<br/>The Battalion stood to arms on the alarm post with bayonets fixed fro 0500 to 0600. Bright moonlight and the men stood in their places silently. Outposts reported all quiet so the line was thinned down to normal and the Punch bowl garrison withdrawn. Our Light Horse found two camels and brought them back. Went back to bed and slept. Round the outposts on horseback after breakfast with C.O. found all normal. The post on Hogs back under great difficulties owing to sand the sentry having to put his greatcoat over his head. The Light Horse squadron returned at 1300 having completed their job.</p>
<p>Military justice &ndash; the R.S.M gives me names of offenders and what they have done. I know them all and put in either a good word or a bad one and suggest say 28 days field punishment No. 2 for a tough nut. C.O. goes down to orderly room and hears case awards the agreed punishment and accused is out before he knows what's up. "Escort &amp; accused right turn left wheel quick march". However on the whole this system works very well. Roth returned from Cairo.</p>
<p>After dark went round the outposts with the C.O. the whisper of the sand insistent in the bright moonlight and every little tuft and fold of ground &amp; quite deceptive and like bodies of troops. Picked up no. 2 picquet and went on foot to the sentry groups. Very alert "Halt! Hands up". Then to Number 2 picquet which we had very great trouble in finding so easy is it to get lost. Eventually we tumbled on a sentry group &amp; located ourselves. Returning to camp we lost our bearings again and found ourselves about a mile away near the 23rd Battn. Camp. Picquets are about &frac34; mile from camp, sentry groups about 500 yards out during day but reduced to about 200 yards at night. Reinforced each picquet with an additional platoon &amp; bivouacked the inlying picquet on the alarm post. Double sentry over arms. Our reports today show enemy mounted concentrating 80 miles away and scattered Arab patrols close in. Bed 2200.</p>
