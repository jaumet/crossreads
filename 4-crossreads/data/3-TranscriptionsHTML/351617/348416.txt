<p>the next station ahead was blown in killing one of our boys, Mullins and 8 Artillery signallers, and seriously wounding Crofts, and poor old Bill Morris my Cobber in the run through Polygon. It was only that afternoon that he got his Military Medal Ribbon, and then he got this issue in the chest and face and he never saw war again. He went to Blighty with Crofts and both went home, the only 2 survivors of 11 in the pill box at the time. Poor old Mullins was buried just up behind where he was killed with the 8 Artillery Sigs and later on we sent a decent Cross up to mark his grave.</p>
<p>On the night of the 17th, just on Sandown we handed over to 4 others and went back to Ypres for a spell. Just as we were leaving the Ridge we noticed a big Cloud of Smoke go up from Sans Souci way and along the duckboards we learnt Fritz had got one of our big shell Dumps</p>
