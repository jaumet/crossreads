Up 9.30 am, having breakfast about 11 am at Library Hut. About 12 noon went to Dr Holland's in E.40th St and had to wait for him about an hour. He had another look at me with Fleuroscope and wants me to go to N.Y. Hospital tomorrow at 9 am to have X Ray photos taken. I hinted to him I wanted money but nothing doing, so in the end I asked him straight out and he gave me 2 dollars.
Had lunch then and went and looked over Central Terminal, then came back to hut where we had a special afternoon tea given us by the ladies. We were each given a folding aluminium drinking cup and calendar for souvenirs of N.Y. We also received several invitations to diners and teas at different places. 
After tea lent Kendrick 2 dollars, he says he has not yet got his money. 
Nice fine day. Arrived home 8.15 pm and had hot bath then off to bed 9.30 pm.
