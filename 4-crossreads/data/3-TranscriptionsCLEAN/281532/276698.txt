 A fairly fine day. Turned out the whole Battalion for parade but 200 men had to be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                bathed which cut into our work. Smith took some Lewis gunners away for live shooting. Our N.C.Os school is also on the go and the new N.C.Os seem to be rapidly acquiring confidence. The afternoon was filled in completely by football matches and it was great to see all the officers and men out and to note to interest displayed by all in it. Took a walk into the Village and there saw Major Reed and Bowes Kelly at the 21st Headquarters. Returning from here looked in at the 24th for a yarn to Elwood. A moonlight night with grey scurrying clouds. Choice gems of language from the troops kept floating on the wind's wings.
