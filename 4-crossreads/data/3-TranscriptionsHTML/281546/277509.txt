<p>I returned at 6.30 and formed up in the Queue outside the Cinema Hall and at 7 Pm the doors opened and we all filed in, It did not take long to fill the Hall and at 7.30 when the Orchestra struck up a lively tune the place was packed, it was quiet a treat to see the W.R.A.F Girls all over the Hall. The seats raised at the back were filled with Officers and N.C.O's with a fair number of Girls with two and three stripes on looking around one could hardly notice two or 3 girls together, they all mostly had Boys as companions. Several W.A.A.C.Girls came in and they did not receive a too good of a reception, several lads in the Hall started Hooting and I knew in an instant something was wrong, on making inquiries, I was told that when the W.R.A.F.Girls went promenading down to the village, the W.A.A.C. Girls hooted and hissed them when passing their Camp, evidently jealous of their positions, &amp; that easly explained the Hooting in the Hall. The Aeros Concert</p>
