<p>I slept on, or rather tried to sleep at War Chest Club the 1st night as it felt very queer getting in between two sheets and feeling your head descend into the depths of a pillow</p>
<p>June 11th &ndash; 17<br/>Met Norrie once again which was a tonic for both of us as we had not seen each other for 12 months.</p>
<p>Walked round London and saw many well known and much talked of buildings Parliament House, Albert Hall, Albert Memorial, Rotten Row and other places of interest</p>
<p>At midday met Norm Thackeray, cabled Home also</p>
