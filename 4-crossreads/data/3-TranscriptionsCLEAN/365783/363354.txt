On the morning of Xmas eve preparations were being made for the fancy dress ball to be held in the evening.   This duly came off after dinner & was a great success - most of the nurses & officers appeared in some sort of fancy dress & considering the limited time at our disposal & the scanty material available some very good make ups were seen.   I went as "sweet seventeen" & wore one of the nurses night gowns with low neck & short sleeves - the portion of the gown covering the front of the chest was handsomely embroidered in blue silk.   A very beautiful yellow silk sash with large bow surrounded the waist.   The bottom edge of the gown was decorated with green crinkled paper & reached only as far as the knees.   A pair of pyjamas turned up to the knees & edged with green paper formed the only under garment.   A pair of Sister Stolos white stockings clothed the nether limbs.   A fair wig was worn with two large plaits with which was intertwined some strands of red silk.   A large panama hat trimmed with ribbons & a bunch of mistletoe & secured to the head with a beautiful red silk veil completed the costume.   My lips & cheeks were touched up with rouge & tooth powder
