 [Contd. from page 154] Our arguments continue till tea time On subjects we all know about And during the noise amidst all the boys Old Pippo starts yelling [indecipherable] 
 But although we argue & argue And that to only one thing all agree Which is of course & that I think you'll endorse That we'll soon be "civvies" & free 
 So here health to Australia & England And a curse to the bumper of war And that Mothers & sisters & sweethearts are happy Is the wish of the Permanent Four
