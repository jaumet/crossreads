Perham is a daisy when the wind sweeps over...it's like no other wind on earth in piercing quality & cold as Death's own fingers. Since the big frost began we have had three weeks of steady freeze. The temperature not once rising above 27  F, but often lower. Heavy snow fell from the 4th to the 6th & now lies on the ground (& the roofs) frozen in solid masses. Even the water supply froze up & for some days we've had to go without a wash until the pipes could be operated on. Naturally this un-usual cold has made itself felt in the shape of a variety of afflictions, the most popular being bronchitis of which I had a slight touch - nothing to matter. Sergeant "Sugar", one of our section sergts, cured me with rum. As a matter of fact it is commonly said that here & in France Rum is the  only friend the sick soldier has in the cold months.
13/2/17 Slight thaw beginning, - that is it got rottenly sticky yesterday evening but froze again & same process is occurring to-day. Have begun our 'gas' course  The helmets are some unpleasant at first but one soon gets used to them & their peculiarities of smell & taste.
15th Warned to go to the HQ Camp Grantham, in Lincolnshire either tomorrow or day following
