<p>to a dump at Blangy Tronville &amp; went to Ialeux&nbsp;railhead &amp; delivered a load of ammo to. Corps reserve dump on the Paris road &amp; again to railhead for a load to take back to Park - my engine started to run very stiff but I was able to get back to park alright. we saw two German tanks at the railhead which have just been captured. they are heavy &amp; ugly looking things &amp; dont look as efficient a weapon as ours</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 29<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We put off our load of ammo &amp; pulled into the&nbsp;5<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;M.T. Workshop in the square in front of&nbsp;the church &nbsp;We took off&nbsp;the cylanders &amp; found a big end seized up. the dowel pin had sheared &amp; the bearing had turned covering the oil holes &amp; causing seizure. we took the engine out of the frame &amp; dismantled it. but left the main bearings alone. We had a parade called &amp; were informed that &quot;Ren&quot; had been awarded 90 days No 2 field punishment &amp; he went to Poullainville bird cage to do it -</p>
<p>The stuffed hawk that I souvenired on the 14<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;I mounted on the canopy of my lorry where it looked as though it had just&nbsp;<s>ali</s>&nbsp;landed there &amp; it</p>
