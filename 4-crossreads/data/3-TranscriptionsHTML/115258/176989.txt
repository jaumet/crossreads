<p>My deat Mother,</p>
<p>A big mail came in yesterday and I got seven letters, all told from home so I&#39;ll start one in reply now. We have had a pretty exciting time all last week, although<u>t</u>&nbsp;it really has been tame compared <s>to</s> with the Beersheba push. I am writing this from Ammon. We have cleared up all the turks round this side and it will take the mob some time to get up to the other front; so as I have been a bit off colour the last few days they have sent me back for a spell while they move round. So I&#39;m now in the C.C.S. Ammon and marked &quot; Debility&quot; and I can tell you its the right horse to back alright. i came from bully and biscuits unending and first meal here was chicken, <s>bis</s> megina, sweet biscuits and bread and jam! Think they can keep it up?</p>
