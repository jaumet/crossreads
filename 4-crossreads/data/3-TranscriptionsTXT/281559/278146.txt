Palice very fine : built by Louis 14th who was some hot stuff, finishing up with about 70 kiddies & a few wives etc : the ceilings of the rooms are wonderful for their paintings passed through the Hall of glass, peace chamber, war chamber Chapel bedroom & all the rest : the paintings on the walls & carved woodwork frames & doorways splendid : the room of battle paintings was interesting : the work being great : went round the grounds to the outer place (built for one of his mistresses : & it also was a decent turnout being built of red marble : carriages in stable massive & reckoned the finest in the world : home per motor after a very interesting time : after tea went to the English theatre : a comedy "Billeted" was on & it was very laughable too
Sunday September 1st : Paris
Up at 8.30 : had the morning out with a nice Scotch girl from the Club : met her again at 3 pm & went to St Cloud : nice ride out in the tram : dainty tea together at a French cafe : however a French meal doesn't satisfy one like the good old English style : went to Church after tea & then a nice little walk : Sunday in Paris is more like a holiday & most of the shops are open as per usual : plenty of people out
