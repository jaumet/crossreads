June 19 We draw our kit tonight & go to Weymouth tomorrow. Rang up Com' Bank London but theres nothing there for me. "Rotten luck" ! Unable to get artificial eye until we reach Australia.
20 Up fairly early. 60 of us going today. Believe 300 wounded are waiting to come in from Plymouth & Wandsworth. Nice fine day so will have a good trip. Left London at 12.25 & arrived Westham Camp Weymouth about 5, after a nice trip through beautiful Country. There are about 25 or 30 of us(Dorset) [in margin] Weymouth (Dorset)
