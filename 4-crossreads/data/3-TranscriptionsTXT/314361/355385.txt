 Oct 28 [indecipherable] On the Somme Still here in reserve owing to bad weather. Nothing but wind &amp; slush, with a shower of rain occasionally to make it worse. This is a very barren place, a few weeks ago the scene of heavy fighting, the ground is covered with shell holes large &amp; small. Almost without cease there is a heavy bombardment going on it is like as if there were huge iron works on the other side of hill a few miles away. At night there are hundreds of camp fires on the side of this hill, it looks well. It is surprising the number of observation baloons here. I counted 23 the other day all our own, never see any of Fritz's. It is very cold just now I have on two pairs socks, flannel shirt, wool khaki shirt, cardigan jacket beside uniform &amp; yet it is cold. Yesterday I got a letter from Lou, Mother Wilfred &amp; Ethel. Oct 29th  16 On the Somme More rain wind &amp; slush &amp; colder than ever to day. Yesterday I received two parcels, one was cigarettes the other was lollies, cigarettes  more  a lovely pair socks.
