 My dear Mama I have not written to you or any one since leaving Ismalia. The fault has really not been mine as with the exception of a few days rest on the boat coming to Maiseilles I have been very busy. This letter then from the time I left Army Corps Staff on my journey to France. 
 At present I am well &amp; though in the Danger Zone I am not in the trenches I am attached to General Legge's General Staff 2nd Australian Division, but of this more anon. 
 I left Ismalia on March 25th for Alexandra boarded the troop ship &amp; sailed on the 27th. I was allowed the choice of ships &amp; selected a beauty. I was very comfortable, had a cabin to myself &amp; no work to do. I need scarcely say I took full advantage of the rest. Our trip across was one more of anticipation than incident
