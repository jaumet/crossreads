21/11/17 Locre
A wet and drizzly day. The morning was utilised for the purpose of sewing tabs buttons on greatcoats to keep the flaps out of the mud. Specialist training was also in progress but there was a lot of loafing and the conditions of the camp in general was not good and warranted my getting the company commanders up and giving them a talking to. After lunch there was a football match played in the mud and the dark and weeping skies cast an early darkness over the scene. Am sending the Band sergeant Burrage over to England for fresh band instruments and hope for more music out of the band then. Rode down to Locre at 6.45 for dinner with the General. The three other Colonels were there but there was a lack of vitality about it all. The GBM are off on leave in the morning early which probably accounts for it.
