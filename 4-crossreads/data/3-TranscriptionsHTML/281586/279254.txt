Water is procured at various depths almost anywhere.  The wells are generally sunk on the top of a hill which means of course an extra depth, but also assures easy irrigation of the slopes surrounding it on which are the orchards.</p>
<p>The water is drawn in most cases in wooden buckets on an endless chain.  On the horizontal beam on which the buckets run is placed a huge double wooden wheel connected with rungs (like a circular ladder) at intervals of about 15 inches.
