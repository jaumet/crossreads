  
 of people who invited me home to his place. Had tea & a  bit  good sing song, his wife playing the piano. We sang hymns & as they both belonged to a choir we tried some athems including "Son of my Soul" "Hymn of peace" "Seek ye the Lord". Had a good time & supper & was finally "seen home" by the kind chap.  Walking  Finding my way home myself would have been impossible owing to the extreme darkness. I was very thankful for this evening as the disappointments previously received were leaving me with nothing to do but walk the streets & feel "fed up". 
 Sunday 24th Up today with a definite thing to do as I found out the [Canns?] Lane church was well worth visiting. So after breakfast I went there and got a good seat. It was a Congregational Church which Dr. Jowett used to have previous to going to America. He used to command tremendous congregations & now he returns once a year & admittance to church is by ticket only. I am sending home the church programme. The place was rather fashionable and though people  were did  were rather reserved I managed to get a hymn book & greatly enjoyed the whole service. The anthem was fine. 
 On coming out I got a special paper [re?] two Zepps down & saw the people from church rushing the tram home.
