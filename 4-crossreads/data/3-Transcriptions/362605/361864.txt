<p>We visited the old Church opposite.  I put down its age as 12th century from the windows, arches &amp; tomb decorations.  I was correct too.  We tried to dig some bunnies out but they were too cunning for us &amp; after trying about 4 pop holes we gave it up as a bad job.  This was done on the walk Home not in the Church.</p>
<p>Well!  I did not go for my walk.  A Patient had to be removed to Hospital for an operation so I took Him to Delhi Hospital.  It was a lovely drive in the cool of the evening.</p>
<p>I have been marked indispensable on the list that went to H.Q. this morning.  I shall be detained for a couple of months now I suppose</p>
<p>Well, my dear Ones, I cannot give you any more news.  I am quite happy &amp; well.  I must get Home now before X'mas so it is only a few months longer &amp; you will have Ellis from June.</p>
<p>Best Love to You all.  Don't write long letters now.  They may not reach me, because if I you answer this to reach me in September I may be on my way Home</p>
<p>Love from Harry</p>
