<p>We wandered back through the Citadel &amp; some "Tommy" welsh miners volunteered to show us the well that Joseph was put in. It was getting dark but we went down. It is about 400 ft deep &amp; about 25 ft by 20 ft : cut through solid rock : round the well is a passage about 6 ft wide &amp; high enough to walk upright in by which we descended a couple of hundred feet. As the tunnel winds down "windows" have been cut into the well &amp; the thickness between tunnel &amp; well is about 6 inches : the work all through is wonderful. On reaching the landing we found one of the old cog wheels (wood) used ages ago to draw water from the bottom &amp; a similar wheel on top (still there) used to draw it up to the top. It was too dark to descend lower so we dropped stones &amp; it seemed a long way down to the water. After an interesting chat with the "Tommies" we took the tram back &amp; had a feed at the soldier's Club in the Y.M.C.A. "Park" (Esbekiah Park) This is a nice place for a cheap &amp; good feed Then we took the tram home &amp;amp altogether had a very interesting afternoon's ramble. I got the neck of an earthenware bottle down the bottom of the well. It teemed after tea &amp; we got wet going home. Tent pretty dry during night.</p>
