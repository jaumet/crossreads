9-8-16Wed 9thWe were supposed to attack Bir-El-Abd at 6.30 this morning but the Turks opened the show by putting a couple of shells right amongst our horses before we dismounted for action but got none of us. & a few minutes later we had had horses in a safe position behind a step sand hill & were on the hill above.
the Turkish Infantry welcomed us with a burst of rifle fire from the ridge opposite & the fun commenced.  we soon drove them back to the next ridge & I put the day in on the first ridge (after running a wire from Bde at the led horses) laying at the end with a 'phone   the phone was also connected to the artillery & I was kept busy putting through reports from Major Granville who was directing the troops & giving ranges to the guns from the artillery
