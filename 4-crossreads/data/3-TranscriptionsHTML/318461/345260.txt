<p>night got it in the arm also three others one of the A.M.C fellows was one of them.<br/>fairly quiet today only artillery fire. Tonight will be the usual thing I suppose though they say fritz  is blowing up the Village he is in &amp; is on the retire again.<br/>9. P.M. the guns have started their infernal din again just getting dark.<br/>Thursday 10/5/17<br/>had an awful night &amp; a wonderful escape A shell burst in exactly the same place as the night before &amp; a piece of it set a bag of bombs off that were on top of our little dug-out the din was fearful &amp; the smoke also thought it was all up this time &amp; expected the D-O. to fall in. However nothing happened but I don't want any more as close as that.<br/>Ltn Gardiner &amp; 3 men were killed in a dug-out in the same way so we must consider ourselves fortunate. The two shells have made a nice hole opposite so if another comes tonight it will go a bit farther in.<br/>A beautiful morning again &amp; not a gun on either side firing, quite a relief, but not for long I think as a lot of our Planes are up over us.<br/>Got no sleep of course had 3 gas alarms.<br/>just had a look where bombs went off Rifles are smashed Bayonettes are Broken &amp; all along the side of the road, is eaten with holes surely a special providence is looking after us to escape being hit last night &amp; they tell me its far worse down the front line, this is supports.<br/>Have to go for Rations 9.30. back to Village of Vaux.<br/>Pay 11/1 &pound;25.5.0</p>
