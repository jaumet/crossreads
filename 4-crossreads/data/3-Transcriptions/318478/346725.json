<p>March 9th 1919</p>
<p>The last day of my Peninsular work.  And the hopes of yesterday namely that God was willing were justified;  at the same time it took more of my humble co-operation than I generally put up.  I did my final sketch this morning <strike>of</strike> choosing Helles beach with the ruined fort called 'Seddel Bahr' on the left and Helles cliff or promontery on the right, the Clyde and two other vessells beached &amp; ruined houses &amp; green grass in the foreground.<br/>[Drawing]<br/>I managed to work it to stay on at Helles until I finished my sketch coming on to Kilid Bar [Bahr] by tin Lizzie</p>
