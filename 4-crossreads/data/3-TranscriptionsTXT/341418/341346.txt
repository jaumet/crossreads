it will require some ingenuity to get all my stuff along on this next move. I have a saddle and bridle, grooming kit, heel peg, 'toggle rope', water bucket,  mess tin, feed bag, great coat,  &  water proof cover for my saddle  &  a chain bead rope - all that poor unfortunate "Bernard" M.C. Evan's ch.g., will have to carry . In addition I have two blankets Two prs of breeches, two pairs of trousers Two coats, one suit of pyjamas, two prs of boots, a sun helmet, a slouch hat, a cap. Three shirts, two singlets, 6 or 8 prs of socks, one cardigan jacket, one haversack, water bottle  &  numerous small trifles such as a towel
