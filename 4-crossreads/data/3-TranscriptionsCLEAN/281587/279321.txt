 Presently the firing broke out again, but this time the shells were lobbing on the far side of the hill, catching Johnny as he retreated in haste.  We moved up that evening to the next hill to this, and here the transport was blocked.  The road had become impassable. 
 This is the wildest looking district I have ever seen, I think.  Though some four miles or more away from the Dead Sea, it partakes to a large extent of its barren desolate appearance.
