30/7/17 Campagne & St. OmerBeing wet cancelled march out to parade ground and carried on in the billets with ordinary drill and training.  Went round and saw some of the people who are very nice and agreeable.  A very pretty little place this.  Major Matthews commenced duty today.  After lunch went to a conference at Bde HQ and then on to St Omer.  Saw the old Abbey (980) now in ruins and the Cathedral of Notre Dame where a priest very obligingly showed us round.  Two big market squares.  The Rue de Dunkirke is a fine street and in the shops were pleasant faced nice girls with whom it was pleasant to talk. Had a good dinner at Cafe Vincent with Dooley and the doctor and then rode home by 10 pm.  Arques is also a fairly large place & near here on the canal is a lock supposed to be an engineering wonder.  Trotted home over wet cobble stones and had no misadventures.  A busy day take it all round.  Once more we are in lovely lovely country and the wheat is in golden ear.
