<p>Sunday 15th Dec.  On the Colonel pointing out to me that I was supposed to set off for return to Australia, I decided to hang on for a few weeks longer, so as to finish my job.  By midday I had my particulars &amp; then started writing out my indents finishing about 8 P.M. when the Colonel signed the lot, some 20 odd indents all of which had to be verified with each article placed in its special section.  Our late Q.M. may have had his good points but he left this unit in a fearful mess as regards equipment.  Our shortages are colossal with no system of bookkeeping &amp; things lost years ago we have not only not replaced but forgotten about, so that on checking our lists, a difficult proposition as all wagons are loaded, I came upon items never suspected.  However I have done my best &amp; don't grudge the effort as the Colonel treats me well.</p>
