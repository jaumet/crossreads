<p>countrys good money, no wonder this war is costing so much when we carry so many drones on our backs they are a lovely crowd.<br/>The Coy were paid tonight &amp; wherever you look gambling is going on. Saw some Tanks going across country this evening making their way to the firing line.</p>
<p>9th  Got our orders to move early this morning so we have been very busy packing up &amp; getting our platoons ready, &amp; billets cleaned out.<br/>There has been very heavy gunfire all last night &amp; it is still going strong Jock has just had a streak of luck at "two up" a fair little pile<br/>Quite a number of the Coy. were absent last night from the Tattoo Call especially No 9. so things have been very busy in the Orderly Room.</p>
