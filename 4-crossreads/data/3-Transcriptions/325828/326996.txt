<p>the C.M.G before leaving England for Australia.  Just about lunch time on Saturday (about 4 hours after I returned) I was taken ill with severe pains in stomach especially on the right side.  I got word down to our M.O. &amp; after examining me he packed me off in an ambulance to the Hospital.  They operated about 10 o'clock that night for appendicitis &amp; I am now doing well.  I am at present in No 1 New Zealand Stationary Hospital, France, &amp; they are treating me very well.  I don't know where I will go to after I leave here probably in another 7 or 8 days but will write later &amp; let you know.  Just before I was taken</p>
