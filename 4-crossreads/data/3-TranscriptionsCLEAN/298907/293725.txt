  
 I prefer it to hot now especially in the Summer time for you feel so fresh & fit, while hot water on the other hand makes you so sleepy tired & lazy. 
 This morning the Dr. examined us all in a big room, where all the patients collected, I have to have my side dressed daily & he also marked me for route marches as if I don't do enough of that already I am noted among the boys for the pace & distances I walk for I love it over here among such beautiful scenes & its the only way I can make myself sleep get real tired out, they took Rilen's board & papers away from him so I suppose he will be going any time I wish he could stop here a little longer for he is a good fellow.
