  
 Friday 27 July 1917 
 We made a success of an ambush last night. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.] Put men in an old MUD HUT, & waited Johnny's arrival. Single scouts were allowed to pass then the Officer was shot dead, 1 prisoner taken, 1 wounded & 2 horses shot. Turk put up a good fight, firing his revolver till finished. I was not actually in the Hut but in support. 
 Out 24 hours & got home very tired.  Shift Camp in the morning. Jim Ayre went Cairo on leave. I hear he's now in Hospital with GASTRITIS, was not strong enough for this job.   Am wondering how long my innards will stand this life.
