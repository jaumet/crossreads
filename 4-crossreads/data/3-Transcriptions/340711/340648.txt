<p>Tuesday, 8.<br/>Quiet day in our new pozzie. At 9.pm 6 teams (and myself and Bdr. McBean) ready to move off. Ordered instead to "unhook". We "stood to" for an hour---then order "unharness". Then an hour later "hook in" and move off. German shell fire heavy near Ancre and Boiselle Valley---burst on either side of us. Trotted past dangerous places. Left Pits about 1.am. Full trot near Becourt Wood---because of shells. Dvr. Freeman hit, also Dawkins' horse. Freeman in hospital. Shot horse. Had to return through Albert on account shell fire. Arrived home 4.am.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 9.<br/>News received that 2nd Division to come out and go for a ten days rest. Our guns came out and arrived at Wagon Line at 7.pm. Fellows glad to get out for a spell. They all stated how strange it seemed to be away from the roar of the guns. Bdr. Vantin wounded by a premature burst from the 18th Battery just as he was getting ready to go..</p>
