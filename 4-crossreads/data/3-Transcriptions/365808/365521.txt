<p>France 12/6/17</p>
<p>Dear Dad,<br/>We are just on the verge of another move after having been out of the line for nearly a month &ndash; a spell which was very much appreciated by all &ndash; as France is now soon at its best and well worth seeing. Also the stunt on the 3 rd of May had rather knocked the battalions about and sapped a lot of our energy. But its wonderful how chaps recuperate and now they are looking quite brown and hard and fit as fiddles. The work we have been doing here, in its way, is nearly as exhausting and much more monotonous than work in the line, for every day we march out at nine o'clock in the morning and go out four or five miles to the training ground. Here we work until three and then return home. As the weather is now fairly warm the work, although monotonous, is by no means unpleasant &ndash; the route lies through most beautiful country and the training ground is surrounded by lovely shaded woods in which we picnic every day for dinner. But we are all glad to be moving on again, as drill becomes very monotonous in spite of its necessity, and in a few days, I think, we shall find ourselves back where we came from.</p>
<p>Whilst out here we have had sports, horse racing, jumping contests, boxing, and fancy dress shows, all of which help to take one's mind off the war and promote a feeling of interest in one's own battalion. We had a most successful sports meeting about a week ago at a place five miles from here, a lovely natural flat ground about twice as large as the Sydney Cricket Ground, and surrounded by large poplars, with two little streams on either side. All battalions of the brigade were represented and I was the Secretary, in spite of which we had a most successful day, a band in attendance and each event run off as soon as the other was finished, no waiting. The17 th had the good luck to win the three principal races and the long jump with 18 ft 11 ins, which was not so bad. The high jump went to 7 ft. 2 &frac12; ", which was really excellent. The funny part of the show was the bookmaker's rings, where several ex- bookmakers again took a hand at their old business and did a roaring trade &ndash; for all the world like a country picnic meeting.</p>
<p>Another day we had a race meeting and all the old crocks in the Army were brought out to the great amusement of the crowd. There was some great jumping and excellent trotting, in which we again managed to scoop the pool.</p>
<p>Last Sunday we had a fancy dress parade through the village, and it was really a howling success. All the competitors lined up and marched along in the rear of the band, and considering the difficulties under which they worked, some of the turnouts were really first class. The first prize was taken by three of our officers, who were dressed up as a Parisian family, and the characters were sustained excellently. Another turn which was very popular was an Egyptian Orange Seller with a donkey and Moslem lady on its back. This caused immense excitement among the French people, who had never seen the like in all their lives. One old lady said that the strain of our long stay in the trenches had sent us all mad and that this was the result. Nevertheless this is THE event of the year and will be spoken of in the village for years to come.</p>
<p>All these things have put the men into an excellent spirit and they are as happy and keen again as ever. As Company Commander I now have the use of a small mare, and I am rapidly learning to ride fairly well &ndash; everyday or two, several of us go for long rides and gallop over the country and I am getting to like it more and more everyday. The horses are looking in good condition and have lovely coats &ndash; the grass is rich and plentiful and the effects of the winter have quickly passed xxxxxx. In fact, after just having passed through the coldest winter Europe has had for thirty years, we are now told this the warmest summer since 1899. If this is correct the average European weather in summer must be very agreeable. So far we have had a few really hot days but nothing like Australian weather.</p>
