<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Sunday 5</p>
<p>This is the first quiet Sunday for some time. A few patients to attend to in morning &amp; just finished (11 a.m.). Wonder what to do now.</p>
<p>Did not have long to wait. At 11.30 a train of wounded arrived; dinner late &amp; another train afterwards, then tea &amp; still another train. Carrying stretchers all the time up stairs &amp; along corridors until my arms felt pulled out &amp; my hands refused to grip.</p>
<p>Fairly done up in the evening but took a stroll &amp; met Mat [indecipherable] who was with me on the Suffolk, also man from front. His information was not what could be described as pleasing.</p>
