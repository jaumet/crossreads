January 14th 1916
I have been waiting five months or thereabouts for the day that I would open up this diary; but today I make a start.
My company, the 14th Reinforcements of the 3rd Battalion left Liverpool Camp at 2 P.M. From the Central Station, we march in procession through the streets to the Domain. There were great crowds in the streets and the fellows made a good show. We were reviewed in the "Domain" by the Governor and Major General McCay. Then we marched out to the Agricultural Ground where we are to camp the night as we will not embark till tomorrow morning. General leave has been granted till10 P.M.
