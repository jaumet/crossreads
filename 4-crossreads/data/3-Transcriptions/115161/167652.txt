<p>&quot;Rest&quot; as we understand it in civilian life, means, sleeping, having a lazy time of it, doing as one likes, giving us work for a time.&nbsp; In military life &quot;rest&quot; is a word that we all accept with tokens of misgivings.&nbsp; We do not look forward to it as we do in &quot;civvie&quot; life, that is of course after we know what it signifies.&nbsp; Rest in military life denotes hard work and plenty of it.</p>
<p>In the next war I would suggest that the term &quot;out for a rest&quot; be amended to read &quot;out for a change&quot;.&nbsp; It would sound more correct, and would not be the innocent cause of so much disappointment to many who are not thoroughly acquainted with the peculiarities of military life generally.</p>
<p>However on this occasion we are &quot;out for a rest&quot;, and the programme is much like all other &quot;rests&quot; we have had and which some of us may yet have.&nbsp; Of course a lot of fellows are under the impression that we shall do nothing but loaf about and amuse ourselves.&nbsp; They soon become disillusioned.</p>
<p>The usual &quot;rest&quot; programme is made up as follows, but it varies on occasions as do our rations.</p>
<p>Reveille 6.15.a.m.. Physical jerks, or short route marches&nbsp; (No doubt one of the very best things for us, but not appreciated, while out for a rest, we want to sleep in a bit).&nbsp; Return to breakfast, tired, dirty and bad-tempered, and generally disinclined to do justice to the sumptuous repast set before us.&nbsp; A good sleep we feel is what would do us the most good.</p>
<p>8.45 a.m.. &quot;Drill order&quot;.&nbsp; We fall-in (of course inwardly recognise that we did this when we enlisted), &quot;number off, form fours, right left turn, (someone has got mixed up, so this performance is repeated).&nbsp; Then when all seems to be going right the same &quot;orders&quot;are again given.&nbsp; Then &quot;form fours, right, by your left, quick march&quot;.&nbsp; And we start on our way to the parade ground.&nbsp; The sergeants yelling out at intervals, eft, eft, ight, eft, till you fairly curse the fellow who invented marching, and any other item of the daily routine of the active service man.</p>
<p>We eventually arrive at the spot which has been wisely!! selected</p>
