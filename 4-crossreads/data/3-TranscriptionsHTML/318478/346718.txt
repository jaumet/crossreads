<p>Spruce says he has always had a leaning towards art &amp; beauty and he thinks that Port Stephen is the most beautiful place in the world.  When I told him he would never be as good a painter as a mule catcher he very cleverly replied that a man does not value <strike>his</strike> the gifts that are handed to him with his birth.</p>
<p>I am getting keen to reach Cairo and some news of you.  This trip has indeed cut me off from you but I need not I think dwell on the fact that it would be good to have you alongside when I am working even if I was snappy &amp; even if you said the wrong thing about painting.</p>
<p>I am hoping for the best news of the boys though naturally I am prepared to hear of breaks in behaviour &amp; breaks in health knowing or rather feeling that they have enough of you in 'em to get through well in the long run.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert<br/>Hon. Capt. A.I.F.<br/>C/o H.Q. Cairo.</p>
