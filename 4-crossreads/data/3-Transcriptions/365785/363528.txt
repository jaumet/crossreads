<p>4 Field Ambulance<br/>N.Z. &amp; Aust. Division<br/>M.E.F.</p>
<p>My dear Rene<br/>If you get in touch with either Toby Nickson or Geo. Henderson, will you tell them not to rejoin but get back home.<br/>They must get themselves invalided out as they have done their bit and as I am not now in the Ambulance, I can't look after them.  I am acting as A.D.M.S. [Assistant Director of Medical Services] of the division but send your letters as to the other address I get them quicker.<br/>We are still slowly gaining and keeping what we get, but it's a slow business and I wish it were over &amp; we off home.<br/>Love to B.C. &amp; Will &amp; the others &amp; take a bit yourself.</p>
<p>Yr. affect. uncle<br/>Joseph L. Ruskin</p>
