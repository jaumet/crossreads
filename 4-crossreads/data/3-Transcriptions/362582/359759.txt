<p>Last Thursday I had a half day off duty &amp; we had a most delightful trip. Four of us took train to Barrage. Two of us rode on donkeys &amp; the remaining 2 on a trolly pushed by Arabs. Well, it was simply grand, we had about 45 mins donkey ride there &amp; the same back. The Barrage is a kind of a lock of the Nile, there is also a large "Delta" with most wonderful bridges. There is a Museum with models of the different bridges of the Nile. Then you go on a little further &amp; come to a most beautiful Botanical Garden, which I hope to spend a day in some time shortly, then we returned another road to the train passing the large native prison &amp; through beautifully cultivated land.
