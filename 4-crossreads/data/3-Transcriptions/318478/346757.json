<p>Semakh<br/>June <strike>May</strike> 7th 1919</p>
<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>I am writing form Semakh which is a railway station a picturesque conglomeration of not more than usually dirty Arab huts and a few tents &amp; horses of the occupation people on the Shore, southern end of the much famed Sea of Gallilee.</p>
<p>It is really very beautiful here the Sea or lake laps very pleasantly against the warm grey face of the edge about 10 to 20 feet high &amp; bathing morning &amp; evening is most enjoyable.</p>
<p>I am much better than I thought I could be and tearing out pictures by the yard.</p>
<p>I visited &amp; sketched Tiberius <strike>to</strike> a motor ride of about six miles from here.  Tiberius is really lovely &amp; if one could only begin Palestine from this end instead of the Desert it would give a much better impression.</p>
<p>Round about here there are wonderful subjects just now.</p>
