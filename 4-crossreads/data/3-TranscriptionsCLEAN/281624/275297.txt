  
 Tuesday Nov 30th  Feeling much better excepting my neuralgia which troubles me at night, I am on ordinary diet now after six weeks of milk.  Dr examined some of the old patients with a view to sending them on to England to convalesce.  There is a big convalescent camp to be opened in Sicily shortly and it is expected that a lot of Australians will go there. 
 Wednesday Dec 1st   Twelve months to-day since we arrived at Suez.  Spent day resting up & writing letters.  Felt better all day.  Greece has not yet decided and The Balkans Crisis is the principle topic of discussion. 
 Thursday Dec 2nd  Some men went to the convalescent camp just above the hospital to-day & a lot left for England yesterday.  There was big row in Valletta last night between Maltese & soldiers .  The Maltese being in fault however they are clearing a lot of troops out of Malta through it.  In the p.m I got very bad with Rheumatic pains in the shoulders & had to get a special call from the Dr.  Writing lying in bed I wrote a poem to my sister Elfie. 
 Friday Dec 3rd  Two men from this ward went to Eng to-day.  We had an order read by the Dr from Lord Methuen the Governor of the island concerning the row in Valetta the other night.  Feeling better  Dr has ordered me a rest my nerves are pretty bad.  I had a notice in Malta paper inquiring for some of my mates on the island. 
 Saturday Dec 4th  A lot more were booked for Eng to-day from this ward but no Austs.  They are having a bad time on the peninsular for a lot of men are coming in suffering from frost bite & Rheumatism.  My bed was carried out on to the verandah & I enjoyed a couple of hours in the sun.  According to the papers Austria is suing for peace. 
 Sunday Dec 5th  All the warned men went to England to-day but there were no Australians amongst them - Every trouble or scrape that happens here a poor Australian is blamed for.  They get blamed for every thing and it is all out of pure jealousy.  The English people are not playing the game as  they are making things unbearable
