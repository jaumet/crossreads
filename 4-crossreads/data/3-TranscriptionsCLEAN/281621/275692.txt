  
 April, 1917 Sunday 1 Palm Sunday Unit equipage. Patients begin to move up to Aveluy just the other side of Albert. Last night the Germans bombed Albert, no casualties. 
 Monday 2 Movement in progress & to finish tomorrow. I am still at Buire but will most likely move tomorrow. The weather here is as typical as described. Rain, sleet, snow & sunshine within a few hours. 
 Tuesday 3 At Buire still but expect to move to Aveluy tomorrow. The unit moves to Bazentin again in a few days. 
 Wednesday 4 It is now decided that we will remain here & leave & join the unit at Bazentin on Friday. 
 Thursday 5 Tomorrow Good Friday & I have visions of Sydney Station & crowded mountain trains. Had some special pastry made by an excellent French cook. Beautiful day & night. 
 Friday 6 Move this morning from Buire to Bazentin again. The guns can just be heard from here. Beautiful day & the sky larks are going their hardest. Move tomorrow to Bapaume. 
 Saturday 7 Out of the Somme & once more in Pas de Calais. We moved from Bazentin via Flers, Le Roque Tilloy to Bapaume. This town now 7 miles remote from the line is in a very battered condition & is still shelled by Fritz. About the size of Albert but it seems a better class of town. Guns can be distinctly heard. The neighbouring country is not in a bad state at all. M.D.S.
