Begg led us at a brisk walk in single file across the heavy ground. I'd have given anything for a rest, but you drop behind if you stop, & I stuck with it, besides the sooner these jobs are finished the better, the way he shells at intervals. I trudged along with the tins till the perspiration rolled under my tin hat into my eyes, & I was quite wet with it, as we at last reached C Coy's trench & a sergeant took the tucker. Then there was the long walk back to the Crucifix (where the limber comes), with the empties from the tea & stew at 8 p.m. I struck a big thermos, & it was heavy enough empty.
