<p>Sunday 4 November 1917<br/>Quiet day.  Cannot hear any singing though know it must be going on all day.<br/>Ask Capt. for something to give me some energy, at which he appears amused &amp; reads me a little lecture on the wise arrangement of nature in giving us that want of energy so that we may properly recover.  I reply that never having been ill like this I do not know the feeling but nothing daunts the English out to educate the "A.A." so he <strike>asks if</strike> says "but of course you have nursed lots of pts. who felt like this".  Betsy utterly crushed makes no more remarks.  Reads &amp; tries to make the best of a bad business.</p>
