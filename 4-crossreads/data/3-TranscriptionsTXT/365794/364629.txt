 Thursday 16 [15] August 1917 [1918] Cairo 4.30 p.m., car ride given by S. Musgrave &amp; Mr. Taylor.  Met Lt. Jarrett, 4.45 tea Groppi's, a dear boy he is &amp; so wise too for his young looking face. Muski with S. Hanly &amp; Hediman, bought with 40 Pt. (mess money) 2 finger bowls, Pt. 15 each. (1st mess money ever refunded.) Lt. Jarrett, "I've never felt afraid yet Sister when going into action, worst is when crossing in the open to take a position under gas fire, can do nothing, just walk on with bullets flying all around", so simply said &amp; such a dear lovable man, some girl will be in luck one day.
