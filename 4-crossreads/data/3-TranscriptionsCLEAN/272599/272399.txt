 Morning duties. Afternoon off  Tog up & go into Boulogne. Plenty  to interest one round the docks, troops arriving hospital ships leaving for Blighty, submarines, & destroyer escorts - a busy & everchanging scene. Boulogne is the main artery connecting France & England.  Jock Heylin joins me later & we go to French Cinema at the "Theatre Municiple" a pretty little theatre it proved to be. Spent an enjoyable 2 hours there then home in time to sign off at 9 p.m.
