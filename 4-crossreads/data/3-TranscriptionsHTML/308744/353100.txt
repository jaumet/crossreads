<p>OFFICERS WITH SQUADRON<br/>DURING PERIOD OF<br/>1st July 1918 &ndash; 3rd March 1919<br/> A.F.C.<br/>[pasted over typed page]<br/>The only part of this book covered by Cutlack is Addison's account of the F irst Squadron (ie 33pp. of a total of 75).  Cutlack appears to have based his narrative on Addison's account, which he follows very closely, leaving out, however, details of minor operations, lists of officers taking part in different activities, monthly summaries of the reconnaissances, aerial surveys, raids &amp; other activities of the squadron and similar information which is given in more detail in Addison.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the main events are often almost identical in both narratives which cover the same ground.</p>
<p>All other papers, lists, tables documents etc. including the operations of the 40th wing, are not contained in Cutlack but supplement the information which he just gives very briefly.</p>
