<p>Thursday, 1 July, 1915<br/>Being pay day for the drivers they all visited us for the day, but unfortunately just came to say good bye, as we received orders to be on another boat the Clan Macgillivray before seven with all our equipment so we had to pack our kits again &amp; imshi [hurry off] as we left the Scotian (the best boat we were ever on) we gave tree cheers for the crew they were fine fellows and tried to do everything they could for us, then we went over in a tug to the Clan, a dirty old tub, and worked hard loading her with equipment up till midnight, we even had to carry carcases of meat to the refrigerators as there was an Indian Crew on &amp; it is against their religion to carry it.</p>
<p>Friday, 2 July, 1915<br/>We sailed at 5 a.m. at half speed, there are six nurses on board and a matron and it is funny as a circus, a man cant swear or curse as is a soldiers custom without one of the nurses hearing, we have to walk to the bathroom fully dressed instead of being naked like former boats, some of the scenes that occurred to-daywere good enough for a book, it has been a day of embarrassment for both the nurses &amp; us.  We were on fatigues all day cleaning up the ship God knows what we will be doing next.<br/>There are a lot of Red Cross stores on board, &amp; needless to say we are all now well equipped.</p>
