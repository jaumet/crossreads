     The conveyance of the wounded from the battle field to
Hospital in England is a record of efficiency and tenderness from
beginning to end.  In my case after being carried in from No Man's
Land by a stretcher bearer who came out in broad day light and under
fire to do it, I was carried on a stretcher about two miles down the
saps to the Battalion Aid Port where my wounds were dressed by the
Regimental Medical Officer Capt. C.N. Smith, late of Manly.  His Aid
Port had come in for a good share of the shelling the night before

Dressing (which which every soldier is supplied) myself and thus
keep the wounds clean and help to stop the bleeding.  This undoubtedly
is a great help and lessens the work of the Medical Officers.  From
the Aid Port, still on a stretcher we went to Contalinaison where a
Dressing Station had been installed in the cellar of what had once
been a chateau but is now a heap of rubbish.  Here a staff of
Doctors were busily engaged passing patients through.  Five minutes
generally sufficed and after being innoculated with anti-tetanus
serum away they went by Motor Ambulance to Albert, about five miles
back.  At Albert the same thing occurred only on this occasion a
proper hospital was available.  In most cases the Medical Officers
just take off your bandages, say "Oh Yes", put fresh ones on and
as you are carried out, they add "Hope you have a good time in

how long putting through hundreds of patients each day, is very
commendable.  At Albert I had a meal and then went twelve miles in
a motor ambulance to Corbie on the Somme above Amiens.  At the
clearing station at Corbie the patients are sorted out and those fit
