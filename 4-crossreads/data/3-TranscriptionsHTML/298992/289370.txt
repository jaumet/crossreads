<p>Tommy<br/>By Rudyard Kipling.</p>
<p>I went into a public 'ouse to get a pint of beer,<br/>The publican, he up and sez, - "We serve no "red-coats" 'ere."<br/>The girls behind the bar they laughed and giggled fit to die,<br/>I outs into the street again &ndash; and to myself, sez I:-<br/>Its Tommy this, and Tommy that &ndash; and "Tommy go away",<br/>But its "Thank you Mr Atkins", when the band begins to play.<br/>The band begins to play me boys, the band begins to play,<br/>Then its "Thank you Mr Atkins", - when the band begins to play.</p>
<p>I went into a theatre, as sober as could be,<br/>They gave a drunk civilian room, but 'and't none for me.<br/>They sent me to the gallery, or round the music 'alls,<br/>But when it comes to fightin' &ndash; Lord they'll shove me in the stalls.<br/>For its Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "Tommy wait outside",<br/>But its special train for Atkins, when the "troopers" on the tide.<br/>The troopship's on the tide me boys, the troopship's on the tide.<br/>Oh. its special train for "Atkins" when the troopers on the tide.</p>
<p>Yes, makin' mock o' uniforms, that guard you while you sleep,<br/>Is cheaper than them uniforms, an' their starvation cheap.<br/>An' hustlin' drunken soldiers, when they're goin' large a bit,<br/>Is five times better business, than paradin' in full kit.<br/>Then its Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' Tommy 'ow's yer soul,<br/>But its "thin red line of 'eroes", when the drums begin to roll:<br/>The drums begin to roll me boys, the drums begin to roll,<br/>Oh! Its "thin red line of 'eroes" when the drums begin to roll</p>
<p>We weren't no "thin red 'eroes", nor we aren't no blackguards too,<br/>But single men in barracks, most remarkable like you!<br/>An' if sometimes our conduct isn't all your fancy paints,-<br/>Why, single men in barracks don't grow from plaster saints.<br/>While its Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "Tommy fall be'ind",<br/>But its "Please to walk in front, Sir", - when theres trouble in the wind.<br/>There's trouble in the wind me boys, theres trouble in the wind.<br/>Then its "Please to walk in fron, Sir", when theres trouble in the wind.</p>
<p>You talk of better food for us, an' schools, an' fires an' all,<br/>We'll wait for entry rations, - if you'll only treat us rational.<br/>Don't mess about the cook-room, slops, but prove it to our face,-<br/>The "Widow's" uniform is not the soldier man's disgrace.<br/>For its Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "chuck 'im out the brute",<br/>But its "Savious of 'is Country", when the guns begin to shoot.<br/>For its Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' anything you please,<br/>But Tommy aint no bloomin' fool, - you bet that Tommy sees!</p>
