<p>9 Dec, 1916<br/>Bayoud<br/>Perce forgot to warn the men for observation posts this morning, so we had a bit of hurry up at stand to when he told us we had to go out.  We took our quarts with us &amp; boiled them out there &amp; with the aid of a tin of bully bread &amp; marmalade &amp; a cake of Spurway's we made a pretty decent breakfast.  We sighted King's Patrol about 10 o clock &amp; got into communication with him, he reported firing East of [Russett?], so Smithy flashed the message along to the camp.  Later we heard the deep engine note of a taube it hove into sight flying high as usual, keeping south of the camp &amp; making West.  He flew almost directly over the post I was on, we heard the crackle of his Luis gun at the camp &amp; I took a couple of pots at him.  One would have thought that the shots had scared him for he wheeled his machine about &amp; went back for his life the way he came.</p>
