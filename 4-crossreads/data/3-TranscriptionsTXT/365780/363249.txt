untill their painful breath at last began to failUpon there way to death let pity draw the veilThey would not mind the blow but cut of sound & sightOf comrades [indecipherable] fire they passed to endless nightDeep down on Oceans floor far from the wind & sunThey rest for ever more.  Goodbye to AEI.
No 3A harder fate was theirs than mens  who fight & dieBut still Australia care & will not pass them by.When. Honors lists are read there names will surley beAmong the gallant dead who fought to keep us freeThere winding sheet is that there Sepulchre is wideThe sea birds scream and wheel when silently they dieThere is a monument of History began.When down to death they went Goodbye AEI
The End
