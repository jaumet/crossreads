<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Wednesday 1</p>
<p>Put on job at outpatients dept. as L. Corp: off every afternoon.</p>
<p>Meals at N.C.O.'s mess which is very nice.</p>
<p>Piloted down the Wassa district by an infantry man &amp; vastly surprised at what I saw.</p>
<p>Rather a disappointed afternoon.</p>
<p>Likely to leave for front any day.</p>
<p>Rather depressed at not receiving letters at all, especially from Rita.</p>
<p>Heleopolis is a new clean [indecipherable] suburb of Cairo. Only built a few years where once was a desert.</p>
