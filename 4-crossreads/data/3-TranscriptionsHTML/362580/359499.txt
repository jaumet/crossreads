<p>rode to a very old Fort &ndash; then to the township to a Hotel for luncheon &ndash; Afterwards got fresh Donkeys and had about 5 miles ride to a place call "Montazah" a most beautiful place that was the Kedivers residence, &amp; Harem about 6 large Palaces surrounded by a beautiful garden on a little Bay which is made safe for bathing &amp; yatching by a breakwater.  It is one of prettiest places I have ever seen.  All this huge place is used as an hospital &amp; convalescent Home for soldiers of all nations.  We were greatly welcomed &ndash; shown around the different buildings &amp; grounds &ndash; also had a great afternoon tea on a Piazza overlooking the Bay.  Really this country is wonderful.  We reached Gizinia about 7 p.m. &amp; were all very glad to turn into bed after dinner.  I was sorry I did not see Norman again this week &ndash; but he said he would ring up and make arrangements for Thursday, so as he did.  I had accepted another invitation.  His</p>
