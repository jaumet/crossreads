<p>One of our Aeroplanes through some accident had to come down in the desert and only about 5 miles in front of the Turkish position The whole column had to go out past Bir el abd. several miles Came in contact with strong Turkish patrol who however "imsheed" at our approach. The machine could not be located on account of taking the wrong direction and we returned to HOD EL DEBASIS at half past three in the morning. No feed for the horses dead dog tired and then we had to tramp through the soft sand looking for horse feed I pinched a bag of grain from the Signal Troop as otherwise we would have had no feed for our unfortunate horses who by this time were showing signs of great distress. The men simply lay down just alongside of the saddles in the wet sand That was at 3.30 and at 5 30 we were awakened again and "fed up" again. We were all this time on less than a bottle of water per man We</p>
