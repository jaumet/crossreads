<p>I think we gave Valentine one of those Photos.  We are not pally with Him.  He is an impossible sort of chap &amp; we only tolerate Him for the sake of your Friendship with Mrs. Val &amp; because He is a Manlyite.  But keep this all to yourself.  We took the money for running but Soldiers &amp; Sailors are able to do that without losing the Amateur Statis so it is all O.K.  My leg has not troubled me since &amp; I've done miles &amp; miles of cycling &amp; have never felt the leg again.  I rode to Sarum yesterday &amp; it was a nice ride for it was a perfect day.  I visited both of my Friends &amp; took the "Close" Girls on the river for a row.  I do no rowing.  I taught them last year &amp; they can feather with an Australian Champion</p>
