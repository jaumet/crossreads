<p>January 26th:-  Am "fed up" with life in this camp. Existence is horribly monotonous. Always hungry; cannot get enough to eat, nor can keep myself warm. For the last few weeks the weather has been dull, snowy, and windy. Am anxious to get on draft for France.</p>
<p>March 22nd:- am still here in Fovant. Have secured a few days leave, and leave for Bristol and Bath tomorrow. Both cities are favourite places of resort for our troops.</p>
<p>March 23rd:- Reached Bristol this morning, and took lodgings in City Road. The luxury of a bed is indeed a thing to be appreciated! Was much impressed with Burke's Statue, which is placed in a central part of the city.</p>
<p>March 25th:- visited Bath today, the chief object thereof being to locate the church in which the remains of Governor Phillip had been deposited. Unfortunately I could not remember the name of the church, so spent most of the day examining the walls of various churches, looking through the churchyards, and devoted two hours <strike>to</strike> scanning epitaphs in the Bath Abbey, and to no purpose, for devil a word could I find about the old Admiral. Left for Bristol at 5 PM.</p>
<p>March 26th:- Took a train ride to Filton, afterwards paying a visit to the Art Gallery there seeing a beautiful miniature of Sir Joseph Banks</p>
