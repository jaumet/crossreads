Bones lying here & there & sticking up out of the ground.  I felt so disgusted that I came away & continued on my journey back to the Soldiers Institute opposite the ruined Church & had some biscuits & a cup of tea & set off for the Camp & had my tea, when I entered my Hut I found two letters from my Home in Ausie so I spent the Evening answering them.    On January 29th our Officer Commanding called a Parade it being the Anniversary of our Coy on Active Service.   The OC congratulated the corp on their good work & good behavour & the number of honors the boys have gained in Belgium.
