 Friday 21 December 
 Snow still lies on the ground and frost also formed through the night.  The ground is frozen &amp; so are the water holes. Making a fire all the morning. After dinner I was sent to a village 26 Kilos the other side of Desvres &ndash; a total distance of over 32 Kilos each way.  Took 25 minutes to go there and 20 minutes to return. Run to Samer after tea to A.D.M.S. Signallers and the 5th Div. Workshops. It has been very cold today and my ears feel it most.
