20/3/16.Had to pack up and shift down to the Kasr-el-Nil, barracks today. Marched out and got to the barracks at 11 A.M. We are to do Picquet duty in Cario. These barracks are said to have been built by Napoleon when he occupied Egypt. They are very extensive and could hold 5000 men I reckon.21/3/16.This picquet seems to be a splendid job. I sit on a chair in the Cafe Petrograd for five hours drinking beers at the expense of the house; and that is my days work. I have discovered a home at last!!  The other 19 hours I have to myself. I received some mail today, and I have leave for six hours tonight.
