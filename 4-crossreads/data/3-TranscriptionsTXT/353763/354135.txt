Fleet save the Parramatta steamed out past us  -  It's a huge harbor & presently we got order to anchor & down our mud hook went  -We had a good look round  -  Some very high hills - 2000 feet & more  -  A Well formed crater of an extinct volcano  -  A foreshore of Cocoa nut trees & dense jungle   -  Native huts & [indecipherable] colored natives  -  Two native catamarrans with naked niggers - save for a loin cloth - came near us but there was no trade  -  We cd  -  see Raboul in the distance  -  Presently my presence was requested on the Protector so I was the only man to leave the ship  -  They sent a boat for me & Captain Spooner welcomed me & asked me to see two of his men & then asked me to lunch  -  Right -o  -  We ate & talked & then I learnt that Raboul hadn't surrendered but that Herbert Hohe - a small township on the shores of Simpson Haven - we passed it coming up - had just pulled down the German flag  -  All had happened this morning  -  we saw the good old Union Jack up  -  Half the Naval Brigade had been landed somewhere & were fighting & had sent for reinforcements & that was why the Fleet & Berrima had gone out past us  -  The Parramatta was in front of Raboul & evidently some arrangement had been come to because we got a message that all the mines had been swept up & navigation was clear  -
