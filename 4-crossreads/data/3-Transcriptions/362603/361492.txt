<p>Bulford<br/>21.7.17<br/>Dear Mum, Dad &amp; George,<br/>Only a short note this time.  We have had no mail for over a month.  I suppose it has all been Torpedoed.  Lots of Our mail has gone down too.  I expect a mail in a couple of days, 'cos I had a letter from Bexley of 20.5.17.  Everything is going on in the same old way.  I went to Salisbury on Tuesday &amp; rode out to Milton to go over the Carpet Factory.  They make Axminster carpets besides any amount of common Carpet.  It was very interesting of course.  I went all over the place from the Designer's Office to the Scouring Bins.  Of course it is half idle now on account of the War.  Last Wednesday I went &amp; played the Hymns for the mid- week service in the artillery Lines Y.M.C.A. &amp; then came back to do my Hospital Duty as "chucker out" in the Beer Canteen.  I had a letter from Roy Tredrea, Jack's Brother You know.  Jack had a broken finger &amp; was in a Convalescent Camp at Rouen.  He was attached to a concert party while there &amp; at present is still attached.  Roy has been over on Leave but spent the time in Scotland.<br/>He was unable to get to Bulford &amp; even if He wanted me to go to London to see Him I could not have gone   Well Mum,</p>
