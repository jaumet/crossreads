<p>Prees Heath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. 20.9.17 J.W.<br/>Military Hospital<br/>Shropshire.<br/>England.<br/>Sunday Aftn. 29-7-17.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Since I last wrote, time has flown, &amp; changes have taken place.  I will set your mind at rest at once by saying I am quite O.K. &amp; am in splendid health &amp; strength.  The heading of this letter will puzzle you but the explanation is this.  Three days ago my left jaw commenced to swell; at first I paid little attention to it but the swellings increased, so that yesterday I reported sick to the Medical Officer, who sent me in here.  The jaw &amp; cheek are so much swollen that my eye is almost vanished pro: tem:  The M.O. said it was I.C.T. of the face (Inflammation of the Connective Tissues) - not very explicit is it   I really think the trouble is caused through cutting my wisdom teeth.<br/>When I last wrote, it was from London from the address of Mr. H. Hammond, 5 Matham Grove, East Dulwich, London, S. E. 22.4<br/>In that letter I told how I had put in an application for transfer to the Australian Flying Corps.  That transfer came through quicker than I expected.  On Thursday morning 12th July I was told to be ready to join the 29th Aerodrome the following day.  The next day at 2 p.m. I left Paddington Station, London bound for Shawbury.  I joined the 29th Traing Squadron, Australian Flying Corps at Shawbury that night.  Shawbury is about 8 miles from Shrewsbury in Shropshire, &amp; about 37 miles north west of Birmingham.  Shawbury is a little English village, something like Peel; the aerodrome is in a commanding position, &amp; out there with the 29th Aust. Squadron</p>
