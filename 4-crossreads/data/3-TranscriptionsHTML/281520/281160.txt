<p>Bapaume<br/>19/3/17<br/>Our planes active this morning but have trouble in beating back against a stiff wind.  Battalion moves back tonight to Bazentin Camp No. 8 and goes further back tomorrow.  At 2 pm walked over the Batt HQ &ndash; a few heavy shells coming over.  Relieved there by the 26th Battalion and marched back to Misty Way where tents were lying on the ground ready for erection.  The men piled arms and got to work in a sharp shower.  A camp soon sprang up like a mushroom.</p>
<p>It started to blow in the evening and tents commenced dripping.  Yarned with the Dr. &amp; Colonel all the evening &amp; then turned in lacing up my valise from top to bottom.  The men 17 to a tent but all warm and though no issue of candles there was a light in every tent.  Crowds of troops and transport bivouacked here just like manoeuvres.  Cookers had great trouble getting along road and did not reach here till 3.30 am.  Saw General Smith during morning.  He is sacking Davis &amp; has handed out 28 days No 2 as a start</p>
