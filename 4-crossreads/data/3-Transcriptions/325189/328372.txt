<p>Punjaubis.  Splendid horses are to be seen everywhere the majority of them being stallions.  During the Sunday afternoon I climbed the largest pyramid Cheops.  The 451 ft. take some climbing but a fine view is obtained from the summit.  In the centre of the blunt apex is a flag-pole several feet high.  It is said that the top layers of stone once reached the height of the pole but Napoleon knocked them off.  Coffee &amp; tea can obtained on the summit.  An arab offered to descend Cheops &amp; climb the second Pyramid in 8 mins.  Some of the fellows have seen him do it.</p>
