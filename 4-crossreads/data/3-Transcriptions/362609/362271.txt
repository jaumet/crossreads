<p>concerning which I have not a clear recollection. The hospital was an English one and the staff struck me as being splendid. Most of their cases were serious ones and there were 2 or 3 deaths in the ward during my stay. The arm was pretty troublesome and caused them some anxiety at first. Dressings were frequently done and after a time the measures used brought the temperature down. The food and drink were of the best and everyone was well looked after. I remember that 2 officers, one a lieutenant of an English regiment   and the other a Lieut. Col. of a Scottish regiment made me wild by openly stating that they were there on their way to spend Xmas at home, being tired of trench life. It scarcely seemed to be playing the same game whilst the other chaps in the line were sticking it out.<br/>The weather was bitterly cold with heavy frosts each morning, but fortunately my bed was close to one of the two stoves that were kept going all the time to warm the ward. It meant too that lying awake through the long night hours it was not so lonely while sister was sitting in front of the fire close by.<br/>On one occasion a Canadian Padre came through and brought paper and envelopes for a letter home and to Rid. He also occasionally brought a beautiful gramophone up and played some of the best obtainable records  on it, it thrilled one to hear this music. On another day I got R.A.M.C. corporal to send off a cable to the home folk to let them know I was all right.<br/>At last one morning when he did his rounds the doctor marked my chart  for "Blighty" and straight away rthey started to dress up the cases in warm things fo;r the journey. Leaving the hospital about midday we were taken by ambulance to the station, and as the back flap of the car was rolled up I was able to catch some delightful glimpses of the snow clad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;landscape. One picture that comes back to mind was an    old tile-roofed cottage with a large chimney place at the end surrounded by a straggling hawthorn hedge laden with red berries, the whole thing being liberally besprinkled with snow. Rouen appeared to be a large up to date city and one wished to be well enough and free enough to spend some time exploring it.<br/>The train journey this time was made in one of the comfortable French 1st class carriages with bunks made up on the seats. There was not nearly so much jolting as during the previous journey to Rouen due no doubt to the carriage being better supplied with springs. The train was artificially heated but there was a nip in the air that made a hot meal served about dusk heartily appreciated.<br/>It was fairly late when we drew up at Le Havre where the train ran almost down to the wharf alongside which was moored the "Bulwer Castle", a magnificent Castle liner plying between France and England as a hospital ship. A big stretcher party was awaiting our arrival. Unfortunately the arm got a bad wrench as they took the stretcher through the narrow passageway at the end of the corridor in order to lower it to the ground. Through a real gale of rain and wind that made it necessary to hang on tightly to our covering of blankets, we were carried on board</p>
