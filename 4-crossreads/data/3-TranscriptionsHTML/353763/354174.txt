<p>The Australia &ndash; Syd &amp; Melbourne have gone but this morning we heard that the Australia &amp; Sydney were on their way back  -  This is but common sense since not a single German war ship in the Pacific has been captured  -  The A  M &amp; Syd left &ndash; presumably to convoy our troopers across the Indian Ocean  -  You see in a sea fight it's all a question of guns &amp; gunfire &amp; the Australia only in our Pacific fleet (bar Japanese) is the equal of the Scharnhorst  -  There are 5 or 6 German war boats about &amp; no one knows where  -<br/>We've heard nothing about AE1 &ndash; AE2 is very carefully convoyed now I can tell you  -  A submarine is all iron &amp; machinery  -  I talked to a stoker in my sick bay this morning &amp; asked him what the men on AE2 thought  -  They thought he said she'd dived &amp; hadn't come up  -  The pressure below 100 feet wd eventually <strike>burst</strike> crush them  -  Just an accident he said  -  We heard a <u>buz</u>   -  that the Russians had landed troops in France &ndash; that the English &amp; French &amp; Belgians had driven the Germans back out of France &ndash; that "Bill" had thrown in his hand &amp; wanted peace &ndash; probably all buz  -  We hear nothing about Europe  -  No papers since Townsville &amp; not a reliable item from any source  -</p>
