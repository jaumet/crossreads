<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Wednesday 13</p>
<p>At Artillery Rd. dress stat</p>
<p>Aeroplanes have been circling over our flank very low down<br/> for some days now.  I have hoped that something may be expected on this flank before very long.  Possibly Ghurkhas may try to straighten the line out at Lone Pine.</p>
<p>Heard that a certain General said we should be finished here by Christmas. Very cold to-day &ndash; cold continues all through day instead of only night as heretofore.</p>
<p>General Walker hit in arm by ricochet bullet.</p>
