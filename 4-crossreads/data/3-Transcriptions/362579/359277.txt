<p>Using some of it now   &amp;  it is lovely. I shall try   &amp;  scribble a few lines to her next. Suppose it will be weeks before I get my Aust.letters again.<br/>Yesterday when I went to Miss Conyers, there were heaps of News Papers of all kinds for me &ndash; dating back to last Augt. So I think it is best not to send them to me while I'm travelling around. Heaps from my faithful friends The Osbournes.</p>
<p>Do you know how they are? I must write to them this mail   &amp;  ask them not to send any papers for a while.</p>
<p>Must stop now. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
