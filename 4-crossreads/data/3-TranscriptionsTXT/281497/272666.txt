4th  A lot of details came in last night from England, some of them have been malingering there for 15 months & more, & must have been absolutely kicked out: or they would have never stirred
This morning the whole company were instructed how to load & work a Lewis gun, a fine & most necessary thing I reckon for it often happens that the whole crew of them get knocked out & if you are in a tight corner they are just the thing, & they are so light & handy, they fire 47 shots in 5 secs so they are pretty fast while they were instructing us a shot was accidently fired
