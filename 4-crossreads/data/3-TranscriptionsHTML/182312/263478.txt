<p>your immediate vicinity but now you must keep your eyes open for</p>
<p>distant flares lest they expose you.&nbsp; By walking doubles up we</p>
<p>reach the first post unobserved.&nbsp; &quot;Good night sergeant&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Good</p>
<p>night sir, everything is O.K. here except for the cold.&nbsp; That tea</p>
<p>you sent up last night was frozen solid by the time we got it (tea</p>
<p>and water are carried in 2 gallon petrol tins) and as all our water</p>
<p>bottles are frozen we have been unable to get a drink.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had</p>
<p>the men sitting on the tins in turn in the hopes that the heat of</p>
<p>their bodies would melt the ice, but this only yielded a trickle</p>
<p>after the whole personel of the post had had a turn at the hatching</p>
<p>business.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;That&#39;s bad luck, sergeant, but we may be able to fix</p>
<p>you up with something before daylight as we have sent to try and</p>
<p>get some &quot;Tommy Cookers&quot; (a small spirit lamp operated by solidified</p>
<p>spirit) and if these are procurable you shall have one&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Thank</p>
<p>you, sir, good night.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Good night sergeant&quot;.&nbsp; We crawl over the</p>
<p>parados and make for No. 2 post.&nbsp; We have not gone more than about</p>
<p>30 yards when a couple of rifle shots whiz close by us, so knowing</p>
<p>that we are spotted we finish the journey on hands and knees in</p>
<p>which attitude we are scarcely likely to be visible from the German</p>
<p>line which is still about 150 yards away.&nbsp; As a preliminary</p>
<p>precaution we had wrapped sandbags round our knees, and put on</p>
<p>leather gloves so that the crawling about in the snow would not</p>
<p>inconvenience us too much.&nbsp; No. 2 post reported the same trouble</p>
<p>with the tea and also that through lack of being able to move about</p>
<p>the men were finding difficulty in keeping the blood circulation</p>
<p>in their feet.&nbsp; Here the Sergeant was instructed to make each</p>
<p>man responsible for the condition of the feet of the man on his</p>
<p>immediate left.&nbsp; This had been found to work well before, each</p>
<p>man taking the bare foot of his neighbour between his knees in</p>
