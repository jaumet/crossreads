<p>I had a bunk &ndash; there are only 3 in that funny little cabin &ndash; shut off fore &amp; aft by red curtains from the sailor men but drawn back at bed time  -  I slept vy  -  well indeed &ndash; my first night on a submarine  -  When you sit in this small wardroom it requires but little imagination to fancy you are close to a vy  swell pantry with the walls lined with brass &amp; pewter &amp; silver contraptions  -  A six foot man must be careful about his head I can tell you  -  All around are electric &amp; mechanical contrivances  The latest thing in the application of these sciences  -  At 6.30 am we had morng  -  tea &amp; then a jolly swim &amp; a little water polo then dress &amp; breakfast &amp; talk then to the beach &amp; Stoker &amp; I wandered &amp;  examined the trees &amp; ferns &amp; rocks &amp; got some vy good botanical specimens -  At 10.30 we all went inboard &ndash; the crew had been bathing &amp; then AE2 came up the harbor &amp; we passed in grand style</p>
