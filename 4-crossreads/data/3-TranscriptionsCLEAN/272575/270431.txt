Next week I may be able to find Eric a Jim Elder.   They are up with the Btn again I had a short note from Simmons I guess he will be surprised when he sees me he received the verses Mother sent and in his note he asked me to thank her for him he has been very lucky, has not had a scratch yet, but he must have had a hard time in the cold weather, in fact all who were in the trenches must have suffered.   had I been there in the winter I should have gone away with Trench feet for even now I feel the cold in my feet and hands.   I wish we were a long way farther south then I might have a chance to run down and see Sister Nell.  She is at Les Andelys, and that is too far from this camp.   if I get hit again I may be able to go and see her.   Last night I wrote to J.   H's letter came along with the rest, so I answered it straightaway.   now the sun is shining but only very feebly so I am going outside for awhile as it is very cold in the tent.heaps of love to all especially Mother and yourself   from Chas
