  
 Monday 16 July 1917. 
 Still feeling crook but went on the riding test and mounted drill. At the remount depot we saw some beautiful exhibitions of buckjumping. 
 Weighed myself on QM's scales at R. Depot and was 9 st. 12 lbs.  
 Have dropped weight owing to being crook the last fortnight. 
 "Gaggat & the Boy" released from close custody  
 For those who wanted leave there was leave given for 3 hrs to go to Moascar. I never troubled it. 
 Posted up that those who were under open arrest have been released as it was a mistake that we got into Ismailia on Sunday afternoon. 
 Met "Sid Glover" who is now in Details camp. 
 1 biplane wrecked at Aerodrome and pilot killed.
