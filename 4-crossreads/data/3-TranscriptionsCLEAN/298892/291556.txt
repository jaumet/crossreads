  
 I got tired of Fred. Clarke the Corporal, although still very friendly with him, because he was too officious and always anxious to show his authority when any Officers are by. At present the five of us have a nice hut to ourselves. in which we  We also have our Dispensary in it and hold our Sick Parades there. I believe we will all get four days leave shortly in which to visit London. Warne and I intend making the trip together. I will have plenty to tell you about afterwards. Every arrangement is made for any Australian visiting London. On arrival one reports to the Australian Headquarters and is from thence taken to the Australian Club where he can obtain board free of charge. The trip on the boat did not agree with me too well but I am now feeling fine. I will post you all the snapshots I have taken, along with this letter. With best love to all I remain Your loving Son, Eugene.
