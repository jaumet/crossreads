<p>6 Monday<br/>We fell in 9 am &amp; marched out of the town for about a mile &amp; a half, where we were inspected by the DADMS. ADMS &amp; an English Colonel.  The Ambulance was complete including the transport.  It rained slightly during the afternoon.  Went for a route march about two miles out, up on top of a big hill from where a very good view of the surrounding district can be obtained.</p>
<p>7 Tuesday<br/>It was a very cold morning, everybody is shivering with the cold. The football match between the 4th Fld &amp; the 16th Btn that was to be held this afternoon was postponed on account of the rain.  Raining all day, very heavy at times.  As it was too wet to go out I stopped in all day &amp; played cards.  I also wrote a letter home, but as the post office had closed I couldn't post it.</p>
<p>8 Wednesday<br/>Fell in 8.45 &amp; after marching about a mile we enbussed to Ribemont a village about 21 miles from here &amp; about 3 miles south of Albert.  We came by large French motor busses capable of carrying 32 in each.  They weren't very comfortable, but never the-less it was better than walking.  We arrived in Ribemont about 2.30 &amp; after treading through knee deep mud we got to our huts.  It is about the muddiest place outside the line.  I noticed a good few German prisoners repairing the roads, as I came through the different places.  It is again raining tonight.<br/>'</p>
