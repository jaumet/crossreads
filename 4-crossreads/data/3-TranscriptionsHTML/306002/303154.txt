Horse &amp; were soon on our way for a spell.  A few "Jack Johnsons" fell in the valley this morning &amp; we passed about 20 lads who were killed during the night &amp; this morning.  They are stacked in a dug out till night &amp; then carted down nearly to the beach &amp; buried.  We had a stiff climb up a hill &amp; found we were on the wrong one &amp; just settled down on the next when we received the order to stand to arms &amp; were hurried up the hill opposite &amp; put in the trenches to support the 2nd L.H., very heavy fighting all day.  The Turks made a couple of half-hearted attacks on the trenches, but we mowed down every time &amp; our casualties were practically nil.  We had to sleep in the trenches all night.</p>
