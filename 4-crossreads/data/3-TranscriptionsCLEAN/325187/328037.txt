[Saturday 21 October 1916]
Went to Arnside Cottage & to see Doll's Grandmother an old woman of 80.You will be glad to hear that Father & Mother are now friends again & Dollys marriage has brought them together.Laura is at Walsall but comes down to the Boarding House on Tuesday.Australian Headquarters are in a low part of London down a dirty bye street filled with Costers barrows etc, not an elevating quarter to employ girls in.
