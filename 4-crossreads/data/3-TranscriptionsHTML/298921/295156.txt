<p>July, 1915<br/>Sunday 4<br/>Thank all for letters &amp; papers. Here we are in July &amp; still living in hope &ndash;<br/>Heard that the 2nd LH &amp; 6th L.H. had a big fight last night, wounded still coming in, all happy &ndash;<br/>Dalgetys letter re Dungalean clips just received good prices good report up to 13 &frac12; you see I can't get away from the sheep &ndash; Here one sees only mixed lots of fat tails Persians  &amp; Xbred goats. The milk supply is delivered on its own legs &amp; warm &amp; fresh from the cow &amp; calf driven to your door &amp; milked in the street, but one had better <u>not</u> drink milk in Egypt &ndash; Camels is strong &ndash;</p>
