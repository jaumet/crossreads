<p>lunch the return trip was started on at 1 pm &amp; we arrived back at 3 pm.</p>
<p>The country all along is cultivated &amp; numbers of French people were busy cutting the sugar beat &amp; digging potatoes, &amp; that was all there was to be seen all the way to Domleger &amp; back.</p>
<p>Wednesday I worked a shift on the shunter in Conchil yard &amp; yesterday Friday Nov 1st I worked a shift on the Vron shunter signing out at 2.30 pm, leaving the depot at 2.45 pm arriving at Vron at 3.30 where we had to shunt all rounds roads in between the hangers, where a large number of German prisoners were working, some unloading [material], others loading up trucks, while [numbers] were wheeling stone &amp; gravel to make roads for the motor wagons to travel on.</p>
<p>This is a very large place &amp; is very busy. After we had finished a part of our work we stopped for tea &amp; one of the R.F.A. boys came along with the Daily Mail which contained good news &amp; caused quite a stir.</p>
