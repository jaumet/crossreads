 Re- Hay purchased of Jenkins, Dew Street. 
 A small rick now partly cut into, was purchased on condition that only that part suitable for horses be taken and paid for. 
 Another rick at his farm was purchased at the same time, on the supposition that it had been released;  this was evidently a misunderstanding.  I was informed later that the Military had commandeered it. 
 A sum of &pound;40. was advanced to Mr Jenkins on the two ricks. 
 My suggestions are, that strong representations should be made to Headquarters (see my correspondence on this subject) and that they should get the Military to release the rick at the farm. 
 Perhaps remainder of small rick could be used, the best of it could be cut into chaff and 25&percnt; straw added, the poor patches might also be used in the following manner:-  pour boiling water on that amount of hay required for one feed and feed straight away.
