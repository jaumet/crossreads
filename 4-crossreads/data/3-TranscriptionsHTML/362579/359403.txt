<p>Cannot write very much to-day. Have been out to Crecy, had a lovely motor trip.   <strike>Miss</strike>  The Matron   &amp;  three sisters including myself. We managed to hire a car   &amp;  it was a most interesting   &amp;  enjoyable time.</p>
<p>24.9.17. Unable to finish this last night. Each evening about 8.30 p.m. A little party gather in my room   &amp;  we have a jolly cup of tea but it means no writing done because lights out at 10 p.m., so only have time to bath   &amp;  get to bed. It is great having a bath</p>
