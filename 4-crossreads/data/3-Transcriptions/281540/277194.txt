<p>In my little home in a Trench<br/>(Tune Little grey home in the West)</p>
<p>I<br/>I've a little wet home in a trench<br/>Which the rainstorms continually drench<br/>There are dead Turks all round<br/>All polluting the ground<br/>Oh they give us a beautiful stench<br/>Underneath in the place of a floor<br/>There's a mass of wet mud &amp; some gore<br/>And the "Jess Willards" bear<br/>Through the rain sodden air<br/>O'er my little wet home in the trench</p>
<p>II<br/>There are snipers who keep on the go<br/>So you must keep your old napper down low<br/>And their star shells at night<br/>Make a deuce of a light<br/>Which causes the language to flow<br/>Then biscuits &amp; bully we chew<br/>For its weeks since we tasted a stew<br/>But with shells bursting there<br/>There's no place can compare<br/>With my little wet home in the trench</p>
<p>Words generally known among men but the author anonymous.<br/>Changed all clothes after swim shaved brushed up &amp; eat enormous breakfast of beef &amp; biscuits</p>
