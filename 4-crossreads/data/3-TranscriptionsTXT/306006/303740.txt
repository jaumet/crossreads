who are going leave here at 5.30 tomorrow morning for Abd & have to be back by Wednesday night, the next lot go on Thursday; Si Frost expects to get a Comission in a few days, & will be sent to Details (Moascar) for Instructional purposes; Sutherland has been trying to get the Squadron & Regimental H.Q.Sigs together & make a Sig Troop of them instead of working them in Squadrons, & has at last succeeded, through a brigade order, Col Granville & all the Sqdn leaders are against it, & the Sqdn Sigs also object, but I think it will be much better & it is to be given a trial; I heard tonight that Major Irwin is likely to get into trouble, as a message from Div Headquarters asked for an explanation
