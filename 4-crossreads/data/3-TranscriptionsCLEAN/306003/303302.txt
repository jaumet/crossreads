27.3.16is to be made of it on the telephone  We arrived back in camp about 1.30 PM feeling very fit for dinner;  The interpreter told me today that all the Mahommedans in Egypt are hoping for a Turkish victory as the Sultan of Turkey's grandfather was a great Mahommedan prophet & is worshipped by the Egyptian Mahommedans, & all the Coptic Christians of whom there are a great many in Upper Egypt want English rule, & the small village where Reid & I have had a few rather amusing afternoons drinking tea & smoking with them, are Mahommedans, & Mahommed Bey Massy whom we met there is a relative of a Senussi General & a very cunning manMahommed Bey Massy in my opinion has the looks of a fine leader, & is probably heart & soul with the Senussis himself;C & D Troop went out this evening
