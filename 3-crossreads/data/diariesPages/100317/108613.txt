4/7/18
Still ill. At zero 3 am our Bde hopped over in conjunction with the 4th Division on the left and assisted by tanks. The attack was carried out by the 21st 23rd with 24th in support and ourselves in reserve. The barrage opened rather raggedly but soon settled down to a good bombardment. The going was fairly easy and not a great deal of opposition. By noon we knew of 1300 prisoners for the whole stunt of which 130 were taken by our Bde. The 21st got a tank gun 21 m.g.s. Got up and shaved about 6 pm and realized then that I was very weak again
