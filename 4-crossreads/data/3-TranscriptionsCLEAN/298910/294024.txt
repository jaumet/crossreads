  
 rations & could buy very little. The march from an Ambulance point of view was disgraceful & reflects badly on the leader General Elliott - my estimate of men who fell out was 25 per cent & others say 600 men fell out along the whole line. We could only handle the most serious cases - there were sprained ankles chafes - men fainting & the worst trouble bad fitting boots. If only a very few of the many curses (dinkum Australian) hurled at the General work out, his lot will not be a happy one. We were supposed to get 10 minutes rest every hour - he marched us for 3 hours & gave us an hour, we all got cold & stiff - he then went back looking for his men & found them laying 4 deep in some places. General McKay & other generals inspected as we marched in & if McKay has any good judgement, he must surely have noticed company's missing & how tired & fagged we all were. We rolled in clothes & all & had a jolly good sleep in the Hay among Fowls & they started crowing about 3 am.
