Sunday 1 April 1917
[The following paragraph crossed through.]  4600 Casualties at Gaza so far 600 Killed - Tanks - Howitzers not yet in. Papers will tell you I can't coz of Censor but it is a big fight at Gaza still. Another Parcel tonight from Mother - 2 cakes chocs. etc. & Punch - thank you all so much.
Went to Church & stayed for Communion. I'm not a hyprocrite, I hope, but our Padre GORDON is leaving us & he is a really good man & has done a lot for all ranks in our Brigade - just heard GAZA is evacuated & Turksretreating. We move up in a few days. This is now only a yarn 1st April about GAZA.
