<p>1916 March 14<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>A little more work &amp; a lot of leisure. Nothing of import. Oh yes though. Receive wire from Stan telling of his arrival in Sydney with Harry &amp; Alice and Ted to see me off. Of course our day of sailing has been postponed till next Tues. Go down to Hewletts &amp; meet them. Have dental leave till tomorrow night.</p>
