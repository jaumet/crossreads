Mail day.  Got letters from Frank & mother.
Saturday 12thMy birthday.  Was feeling right again this morning.  Went down to the beach & had a swim.  The water was pretty cold.  Chauncey got sick & it is feared he has typhoid.  He went away probably to Lemnos.  The Turks put in a good deal of shrapnel in the morning but knocked off about 10am, our batteries must have been making it to warm for them.  Had yarn with Capt Robertson this morning & scored a few envelopes off him.
Sunday 13thFine warm day, very quiet.  Howlett got sick & went for a few days spell.  Relieved C Company.  Went into the trenches at noon & came out 6am.  Received letter from Carrie.
