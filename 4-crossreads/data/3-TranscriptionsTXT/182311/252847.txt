 &quot;Pretty Good World&quot; is France in the spring&nbsp; we all feel fit so we are &quot;Pretty Good People&quot;&nbsp; so whats wrong with the general Scheme of things, well only the War &amp; that will be over soon, we hope &amp; I think so. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Two days ago in the long twilight I visited a quiet corner, a  Harold  soldiers cemetery &amp; there I saw the grave of my friend Harry Thomas &amp; many others too whom I had known, a noble little band, quiet, but the brigade cross above them was their emblem of the pride &amp; love &amp; grief of their comrades &amp; of their nation.&nbsp; That is what is wrong with the world, the war &amp; that will be over soon we hope &amp; believe.
