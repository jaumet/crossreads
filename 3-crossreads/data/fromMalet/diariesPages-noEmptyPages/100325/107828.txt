asleep out in open. Reached obelisk and went for a walk after inspecting it through narrow paths between different plots. Delightful smell of greenery everywhere. The obelisk surrounded by trees and crops looking as fresh as if erected yesterday instead of 5000 years ago. The whole quiet peaceful scene so still in the moonlight was only 100 years ago the scene of a most bloody battle with about 70000 troops engaged. J very cut up about B's approaching departure and ours seeing so much of casualties. inclined to worry. Looking very well in red. Returned to gharry and after another hours delightful drive reached hotel again. Souper a deux and
