<p>Sunday 5 August 1917</p>
<p>Now don't worry about me, I am better off here than anywhere &amp; I shall not be back for a fortnight so the Doctor says. Jessie McDonald is here as a nurse. Nowell Forth is at Abbussitta but I've not seen him for sometime.</p>
<p>It is very HOT but the Doctor says he will send me to ALEXANDRIA next week.</p>
<p><strike>Meantime all my love from your son Frank.</strike></p>
