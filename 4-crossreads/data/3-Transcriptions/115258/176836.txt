<p>it is still a bit in flood, but we are now able to swim in it, and it is great as the days have got joly hot down here already. I have been very worried the last day or two Mother, as one of the pockets of my tunic suddenly got quite stiff and stood out from the coat, and looked as if a piece of card board had been stiched inside it; I could not make it out and thought the blooming thing must be haunted - but to-day I have remembered putting a piece of candle in my pocket some time, and as I have left my tunic lying out in the sun, I think the cande must have melted into the cloth. When I get home I think I&#39;ll start a book on Hints to Housewives and try and beat mrs Lance Rawson. I know quite a lot of things - Stiffening pockets with candles, drying wet blankets by spreading them on horses, and making billy cans from Turkish gas helmets - and how to serve bully as &quot;Cold cooked, compressed corned beef with biscuits&quot; - it will be a very good book i think - would you like a presentation copy Mother.</p>
