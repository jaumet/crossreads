<p>Serapeum<br/>Suez Canal 14.4.16<br/>My dear Father,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your letter of 6th March. You will be surprised to hear that this is the first of yours received since one of the Feb 4th, I expect the other letters have gone on to the 1st Division to France, and I shall probably get them some time in the next month or so.</p>
<p>The fact of those previous letters not having arrived leaves me rather in the dark about one or two matters mentioned in your last.</p>
<p>I am of course very relieved to hear you are all keeping well after the long spell without any news of you. Pats letter of 6th March has also come to hand and I am answering it</p>
<p>[The following is written across the top of the page:]<br/>P.S. Am writing Mum separately this mail. TWG.<br/>Had a letter from Arch Castledon lately. The Naval Bridging Train is being disbanded and Arch expects to ge a commission in the Engineers. He is now in Ismailia but I have not seen him yet  TWG</p>
