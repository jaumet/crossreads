<p>22 February, Saturday</p>
<p>W.<br/>We are inoculated on the breast &amp; Capt Beale as rough as a [indecipherable]. I go to Dance but am very crook I do not dance very much &amp; come Home early &amp; go straight to bed. I think of Ellis all day as to his whereabouts. I clean up room &amp; generally tidy up.</p>
<p>23 February, Sunday</p>
<p>F.<br/>Dick &amp; I go walk around Bulford. Meet Woody &amp; Dicky but do not linger. I worry R &amp; D in Flat. I take washin! I nearly buy a fight over ill-treating a dog. I go to Y.W.C.A. &amp; we play up generally especially with Dick. I come Home alone go to bed but cannot sleep until a very late hour. Thomas comes over &amp; is awful drunk. He nearly makes me [indecipherable] with the fumes.</p>
