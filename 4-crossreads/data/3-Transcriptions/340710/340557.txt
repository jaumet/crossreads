<p>A Letter from the Kaiser to Horatio Bottomley re "the end of the War"<br/>Potsdam<br/>10th April 1917</p>
<p>My Dear Mr Bottomley,<br/>To you I must turn in my trouble and ask for your able assistance and advice.  Knowing you to be one who is ever ready to right a wrong or wrong a right as the case may be, I seek your advice as I feel you are even such another as myself although you manage to keep within the Law.<br/>My gallant men on the Western front have found it policy according to the laws of strategy to withdraw to the famous And impregnable Hindenburg Line but the fighting has indeed become very heavy in that region and I feel that something might happen which would not please me.</p>
