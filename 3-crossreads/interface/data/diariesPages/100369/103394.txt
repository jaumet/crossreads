No heart turned to Him, full of grief
But He its sorrow shares
6 
In His cathedral ?neath the skies
Ten million voices raised
Their note of thanks, shall we be last
To lift ours in His praise

Let others tell of Eastern Climes
The joys which they possess
Experience has never made
Me love my own the less
2
The magic lure of Egypts night
Ive sung with fervent zest
I've lived beneath them many a moon
Yet think my own are best
3
The North Star's but a cold dead thing
Indeed, I'm at a loss
To find a single group of Stars
To match the Southern Cross.
4
Australian nights are unsurpassed 
Australian days are fair
And this Australian's heart is stirred
To feel his home is there
5
Oh leave me but in life the Joy
Of giving her my love
In death a home beneath the sod
With her blue skies above
