<p>green clouds produced by the liquid being allowed to escape from large cylinders, enveloped the body of troops.  They remained under those clouds for some minutes but the helmets everywhere proved successful.  Whilst awaiting our turn the wind changed bringing some of the gas over to where we were standing.  We only waited there long enough to get one sniff.  With regard to the "tear" gas we were marched past a hedge behind which weeping gas bombs were exploded.

The guns on the Somme are still going and this morning's papers report good news.</p>
