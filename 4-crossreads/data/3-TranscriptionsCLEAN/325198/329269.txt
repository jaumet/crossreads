17 March, 1916SerapeumWent out on parade as usual this morning & took mid-day meal with us.  We had a good swim before dinner, did no drill at all.  When we got back heard that we had to leave to morrow; later we were told to pack our kit bags & that C squadron & A & B troops from B were to move off at 9 o'clock in the morning
