<p>[Pages 78-79 envelope]<br/>3rd Lon. Gen. Hospital London<br/>4.9.17<br/>My dearest Sister,<br/>Dont use the above address when writing to me - address as before to the Bn. as I will be back with them shortly. I have to see an ear, nose &amp; throat specialist this afternoon. I believe the left antrum is affected - I am just dreading it as my experience of E.N. &amp; T. doctors is still vivid &amp; I hate those horrid things they shove up ones nose etc. Anyway I wont close this until after I see him so will know the worst.<br/>I am awfully fed up getting knocked out like this. Fancy missing injury in all our last stunts &amp; when we come to rest to get hurt at football. I didnt really want to get away from the Bn. just yet. Just back</p>
