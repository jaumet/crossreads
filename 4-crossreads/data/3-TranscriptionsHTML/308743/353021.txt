<p>26 August 1915<br/>Thursday mail</p>
<p>Things have been comparatively quiet all day on all the fronts, only during the night the enemy made one demonstration on the left, our move was put off for 48 hours.  Went down to the Beach this morning &amp; nearly "caught" a piece of lead visited Henderson who supplied us with 4 tins of Milk.  Late in the afternoon they shelled our bivouac for hours with Silent Peter, pieces flying everywhere, the Turks employed a new bomb on a long stick &amp; fired on the rocket principle it makes a decent row coming down &amp; gives very good warning of its approach.  The 20th Bn have taken over Russells Top &amp; we made a combined attack at 2000 oclock with excellent results.  A 22 bag mail arrived today but again none for me from Nell or home which will have to be seen into The bombardment of the Straits is still being carried on &amp; at times assumes a fierce artillery combat Holland went back to the Cape leaving [indecipherable] here the Navy from Suvla Bay having being shelling the Turks off &amp; on all day &amp; in some cases brought enfilade fire to bear on them.</p>
