Ypres - Comines Canal SectorWe travelled by motor lorries from Lec Bois to Vermozille, where the 3rd now have its headquarters at an A.D.S. This place is due  south of Ypres, and leaving Vermozille (only a name) & beginning to cross the desolate treeless ground going up to the front line, Ypres comes into view on the left, as a wonderful but awful picture of ruined churches & heaps of stone. On the road up we had our path shelled ahead of us by shrapnel & high explosive, but we got through safely.Eight of us are at a regimental aid post about 400 yds behind the trenches
