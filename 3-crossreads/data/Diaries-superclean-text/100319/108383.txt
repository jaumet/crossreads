28/9/18 Marquaix
the ruined villages of Boucly and Tincourt. At the latter place we met our guides who took us overland to the side of a hill which is where we are to stay. It was fine fortunately and all the men in the dark soon settled down. Tea was ready on the cookers ? thanks to my performance last night. The Q.M. delivered the blankets and there were some trench shelters. Out of the mix up soon came order and a reasonable amount of contentment. A lot of chaps calling out to one another in the dark. Lots of filthy obscene but cheerful language being used by the coarse soldiery. One of two big shells whistled over towards Marquaix ? our reintroduction to the species. The cheerful but disgusting profanity of the troops very marked the last few days.
