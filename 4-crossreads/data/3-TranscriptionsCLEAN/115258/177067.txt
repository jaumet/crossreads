  
 hundreds of rumours, which nobody ever believes, but the general impression is that  we are to be out of here within two months. I am still in the 14th AGH. Feeling as good as gold but they seem to want to make sure that everybody is perfectly fit before they leave, now they dont want men in the front line, so its rather hard to get out. I may be here for another three weeks yet. Meadows, Griffiths and I are all here and we poke round and have afternoon teas and enjoy ourselves generally. Oh yes! and I got three more parcels yesterday afternoon. That makes eight altogether. There were three from home. The cake was scrumptious, best one I have had over here and the honey was good too, so nice and candy! I gave Sister Trail a piece of the cake and she reckoned it was beautiful. It was funny meeting her. I was in the ward, a few days before I heard her name then I said "are you from Llangothlan Sister" and she said "Yes are you from Wyaldra?"
