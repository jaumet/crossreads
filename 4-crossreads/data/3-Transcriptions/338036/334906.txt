<p>[2nd June contd]<br/>Cooks Way Aid Post is in a very exposed position being right on top of ridge opposite Messines.  During the afternoon got things in order &amp; dodged a few shells Fritz put over.  However we soon became comfortable.  After tea orders came for 4 of us to report to The Only Way and I took 3 others along (it was about 150 yds nearer front line) arriving at 8.30.  We no sooner got comfortable when in came patients and we sent for 4 more bearers to assist.  We were going practically all night in spite of shelling &amp; had some narrow escapes.

<p>Sunday 3rd<br/>Slept until midday notwithstanding that our position was constantly being searched for a machine gun positions.  At noon we were relieved by balance of party and we adjourned to Charing Cross.  There we had a good meal consisting of rabbit pie &amp; oranges (gift of Y.M.C.A.  During tea Fritz began the woods  particularly our portion and from that time (about 5) we were continually being heavily shelled.  It was easily the worst night I have had.</p>
