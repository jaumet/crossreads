 Assuming that one does not&nbsp; want to go to the hotels frequented by 
 millionaires and the Royalties of Europe, there are any quantity of good

 the officers from this Home have brought their wives over from England 
 for a holiday and they are staying at some of the best hotels in Mentone

 these hotels may have been a bit higher in pre-war days but there are so

 cost.&nbsp; We can hire a high powered motor car holding five for the whole

 the cost will be 150 f. (&pound;5/10/-).&nbsp; Tips are very reasonable: even a 
 head waiter will fall on your neck for about tuppence.
