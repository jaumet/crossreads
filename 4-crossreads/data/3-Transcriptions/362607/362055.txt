<p>Dear Mum,<br/>Just spending a few days at Gy. It is an awful dark place. There are absolutely no lights at night. I have bumped right into a least 50 people each night that I have been out. I had 3 hours to wait at Peterboro on the way up. I went to have a look at the Great Cathedral. I could only see the outside as it was dark. I did not mind the Ghosts in the cemetery. I should have been terrified at onetime. It is a more bright afternoon as Jennie &amp; I will take a walk. It is dinner time now so I'll have to ring off. We have lots of Tucker. I went to the Butcher's &amp; bought my own meat. I have to buy my own [indecipherable]<br/>Love to Dad &amp; George  Your loving son  George.</p>
