the 26th July at our appointed camp at Heliopolis & during the time we were in Egypt until we left to go to the Peninsular, we were very hard worked early & late even going on night marches into the Desert & digging trenches & sleeping there until daylight came when we would march back, all these exercises being done with a full Pack which is no light weight on a march through the sandy desert.
We were all allowed to go & see the City of Cairo, which seemed to me to be packed with all sorts & conditions & the smells which greeted one as we were poking about the different parts of Cairo  I also took a trip to the Great sight of the Spinck & the Pyrimids past Mina Camp I took off my boots & went inside the Great Pyrimid & slid down a slope on the Alibaster Floor until one got right inside where guides had Candles lighted & shewed you round the place inside, we came out again & then had to have our fortunes told by an Arab who drew signs in the sand & told us something about sickness & shot etc:
I was promoted Corporal on the 14 August 1915 & a few days after we started on the way for Alexandria, where we got on a ship that was to take us to Gallopoli.  This ship was named the "Saturnia" & she was filthy with dirt lice & Black beetles & on the deck we of A Coy occupied there was a large wooden tub which I should think had had salt beef in as it was one mass of wriggling grubs from decayed meat, we soon got rid of that over the side & we were all very busy now getting what is called iron Rations consisting of a tin which opens at both ends one has tea in & the other end sugar then a tin of Bully Beef
