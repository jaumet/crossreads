25 Dec, 1916BayoudXmas Day;  Cool & beautiful it was this morning.  The boys had a  bit of sport racing down a hill & over the sand for a [duff?].  Red mond won it   The onlookers had the sport though a half a dozen fell & rolled down the hill.  We had a good tuck in for dinner  Duff & fruit & cold meat  It rained during the afternoon, a good heavy shower & it looks rainyfied yet  The thunder is growling & lightening flashing, a big change to the usual tranquil weather - El Arish has been taken & some turks captured  There was practically no fighting, no details to hand yet however.
