 SATURDAY, APRIL 19, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; hot. Went over to see 
 Mum &amp; Dad in the morning. 
 Saw Sisters Lynam &amp; Fraser on 
 the way &amp; they gave me a lift 
 to Carnarvon. Mum &amp; I went 
 down &amp; saw Aunt Janie before 
 lunch. Aunt Millie &amp; [M r  Sauter?] 
 came to Carnarvon for afternoon 
 tea. I came back here for dinner. 
 Linda &amp; I went down to the 
 look out after.
