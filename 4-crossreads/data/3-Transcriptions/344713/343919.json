<p>can sweep the gullies. The "Tommies" seem to leave their dead lying anywhere near line &amp; we had to start burying their leavings as soon as we got here &ndash; Consequently so many "Unknown British Soldier" graves about the country.</p>
<p>Sat. Nov. 4th: -<br/>Relieved by "B Coy" early this morning. Bitterly cold &amp; wet in line &amp; 24 hours at a time is quite sufficient for a polar bear. No casualties &amp; went back to support trenches near Flers.<br/>A few Reinforcements waiting there to join us up &ndash; One of them, I think, his name was Thompson out of the Cyclist Corps, was buried with three of us by the explosion of a large shell &amp; had his neck broken &ndash; Hark luck just joining us up &amp;   getting his "final" before getting in line.<br/>At daytimes the weather seems to clear up but at night the rain starts &amp; make things horrible.<br/>We are on fatigues straight away &amp; have been up to line tonight in rain &amp; mud with rations.</p>
<p>Mon. Nov. 6th: -<br/>As I was writing here a premature burst from one of our own guns caught us here in trench &amp; gave us the "noises in the head". Killed a chap named Bramby in the trench behind.<br/>Left support trenches here at night &amp; went back to road behind Delville Wood. More "Mud-pies".</p>
