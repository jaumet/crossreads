MONDAY, JANUARY 13, 1919.
Very heavy fog all day.
The first I have seen in London
& I hope it is the last. Went to
Horseferry road in the
morning but got no
Satisfaction at all.
Poss went up to Hurdcott
Eric & I & Capt. Ferrier went
to the Hippodrome in the
afternoon
Had lunch at the flat
& stayed there all the
afternoon. Went to the
Soldier Boy at night
with Poss and the mob.
