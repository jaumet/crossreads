<p>Sunday 29 October 1916<br/>A day most unlike a Sunday : it seems ages since I have had a real Sunday. Awake at 4 a.m. to go up the line with the General. A cold dreary morning, the horses being 35 min. late in arriving from the transport lines so that it was after 5.30 when we left the Mametz camp on horseback. Our route for abt. 3 miles way along a road in a fearfully sticky &amp; muddy state &amp; as my pony was frightfully lame my progress was painfully slow &amp; delayed the General. Horses left at Bde. H.Q. &amp; thence pushed up the 2 mls. to the line &amp; right round it, really a tremendous task, increased by reason of rain coming on so that by 10 o'c. &amp; reaching camp I was wet thro', also cold &amp; hungry. The 3rd Bn. band was struggling thro' "O God our help in ages past" at a very wet church parade. 2 bus. had moved off &amp; we had to get things packed &amp; ready to move off by lunch time, 3 of us walking &amp; arriving at Bde. H.Q. abt. 3.30, the rain then having stopped &amp; the sky cleared. 4 of us in a chalk dug-out, &amp; slept well, tho' very cold outside.</p>
