PARCEL. Mother's parcel arrived safely, but the extreme heat had melted the sweets & the TIN was broken. Shortbread & pudding very good also buttons, many thanks for same.
We go into the Trenches for a week after tomorrow to give our Horses a spell - it is too hot for large operations, the Infantry couldn't stand it, but they make raids at night, just to keep Johnny Turk jumping.
On outpost tonight. The [indecipherable] appear in the Tommy Sections [indecipherable]
