<p>Bulford<br/>5/12/17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>I am just answering Your 3 letters of 30 Sept 7 &amp; 14th October.  I have written to Mum &amp; it is getting on for 10 p.m. now.  But I don't finish Duty till 11 p.m.  I've just had my Supper of Soup &amp; Toast.  I feel quite O.K.  I have been doing a fair amount of cycling &amp; walking lately &amp; I am feeling fit.  You talk about driving Home in the cool of the evening.  It seems impossible to think of any evening being anything else but cool.  I don't find it necessary to wear woollen underpants over here &amp; sometimes for a fortnight we never have the Thermometer higher than freezing point.  I never got to London, Dad.  I pass through on the way to Douglas but I leave London at 4 pm before the Raiders come over.  It is too cold on the fingers &amp; toes to go to Salisbury on the Bike now.  It may snow too &amp; I don't want to ride Home in the snow.  Salisbury is like Home almost to me.  I know all the shops &amp; I meet dozens of people that I nod to.  If I happen to go in to the Town &amp; not go to my Friends, someone will have seen me &amp; tell them all about where I have been.  It is a fairly big Town too.  I often go for a walk with Mr Edmonds who is my other Salisbury Friend.  He is a very nice man.  It is He who works in the Carpet Factory.  He &amp; His wife can never do enough for Ellis &amp; I &amp; they are only hard working people.  I generally visit both places when I go to Sarum.  I play the piano sometimes but I am sadly in need of regular practice.</p>
