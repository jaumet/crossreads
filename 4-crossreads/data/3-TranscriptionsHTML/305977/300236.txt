<p>July 1915<br/>who went out.  There was a big bombardment of Achi Baba in the afternoon.  It was a great sight, but I wouldn't have given much on being there.  More trench digging at night.</p>
<p>Tuesday 13th<br/>We did nothing during the day but it was too hot to sleep.  Our regiment got 60 reinforcements.  "A" Squadron was digging at night &amp; "B" Squadron formed a covering party.  We had 4 hrs out in front &amp; the Turks put in a very heavy fire.  We could hear them talking &amp; their covering party moving in the bushes.  We came back to camp at 4am &amp; I felt pretty tired.</p>
<p>Wednesday 14th<br/>Was on water fatigue in the morning.  Had a fairly busy day &amp; no time for sleep.  Had to go out on covering party again at night.  Was relieved at 12.30am but got no sleep</p>
