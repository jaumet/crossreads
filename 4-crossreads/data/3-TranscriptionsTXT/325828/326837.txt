 [Post card from Parkes showing the Catholic Church] Tichborne,  1.6.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 7.6.15 Tuesday Night 
 My dearest Father, Just a brief note before mail closes.  I have just returned from the Dr.  Went in just after dinner, &amp; filled in necessary forms at Police Station, that I handed to the Govt Dr. (Dr. Johnson, with whom Dr. Walker is in co.) but he wouldn't pass me on account of my leg.  Nothing serious he said &amp; with care would be right in about a week.  Advised me to try again end of next week  if the wound is healed .   Will probably go in on Saturday week &amp; try again.  Very frosty weather fine but cold.  Am keeping well Love to all at home from Leo.
