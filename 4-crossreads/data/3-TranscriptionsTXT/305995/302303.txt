Now that the Turkish reinforcements had been driven back we set to work to clear the field of any wounded that may have been left during the fight. At 7 p.m. the column moved off, with the exception of a New Zealand regiment & the 8th light horse, who were left as escort to our ambulances & the 3rd L.H.F.A. dressing station.  We searched the trenches & redouts & what a gruesome sight they presented. Turks lying in dozens, the result of our heavy fire & it could easily be seen that our artillery had played havoc with them, for some had holes in their head large enough to places one's fist in, the result of shrapnel & high explosives. Fully three hundred Turks were killed & seven died of wounds after we had carried them to our dressing station. By 9.30 p.m. our work on the field was completed
