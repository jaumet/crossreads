<p>1915<br/>Oct. 22 Fri.<br/>At 3 p.m. Went off for a tour of inspection of the Tombs of  the Khalifs &amp; Mamelukes near the Mokattam Hills &amp; then walked through the Dead City.<br/>After tea 4 of us went out to Mena &ndash; secured donkeys &ndash; and went for a ride on the desert behind the Sphinx &amp; Pyramids. It was great!  Everything flooded in moonlight. The Nile looks jolly good with the moonlight shining on it. The Pyramids reflected in the water on the flats.</p>
