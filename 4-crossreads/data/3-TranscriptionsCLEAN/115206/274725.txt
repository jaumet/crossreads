 Battery W.Lines.  near Pont Noyelles Weather glorious. Mother's birthday today. I wonder  how my dearest friend is. Went along to see John during the day. About 9.30 am, we received a surprise, in the form of an an aeroplane of the fighting type armed with three machine guns (named Sopworth Dolphin, flown  by a young Indian Prince Lt Welinkar .Twas was a dandy little machine. Our major entertained the pilot during the  day and as the machine was not repaired by sunset the pilot does not leave until the morning.
