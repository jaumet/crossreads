<p>3.5.15<br/>Mon. 3rd.  To day we rode to a clump of gum trees in Zeiteoun &amp; tied the horses up there.  We then signalled a few messages till dinner time.  Stan went to the dentist &amp; Smithers &amp; I were out on our own.  After dinner we came straight home &amp; were in camp at 3 oclock.  The Colonel gave us a lecture this morning &amp; said there was too many applications for transfers to the Infantry, &amp; said to use Maxwells own words that we would have a belly full of fight before the war finishes.</p>
