<p>The Church of Notre Dame is in the Italian style The roof is doubled the lower one having huge semicircles &amp; the upper painted group above these semicircles gives the idea of a glimpse into Heaven. The decoration is all in a silver grey. The dome is closed till 2 pm but I do not wait. The Palais de Justice, Hotel de Ville are beautiful building whose beauty is robbed by the narrow streets which are so hot &amp; sultry that I again seek the ramparts.</p>
