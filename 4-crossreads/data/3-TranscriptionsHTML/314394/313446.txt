<p>August 2nd.3rd.4th.5th.6th.7th. Nothing</p>
<p>August 8th  A great number have gone down with dysentery, Mr Evans was to go to; the Hospital but the ambulance did not turn up. I have not been affected.<br/>I rode up to the 12th Light Horse on Major O'Hallorans horse to try and see Clive Hunter but he was not to be found. Captain ARNALD is now 2nd in Command. Major O'Halloran is not liked as O.C. and does not know his practical work.</p>
<p>August 9th Nothing<br/>Owing to books having been lost when landing on the Peninsular and the impossibility of obtaining books much of the following is from memory up till the 23rd August</p>
<p>August 14th The 5th Infantry Brigade had received orders to leave for Gallipoli and the 14th was spent in making all the necessary arrangements. First we had as issue of colours, our colours being a diamond shape with green on the lower half and white the upper half, green standing for the Bde. and white the Battalion. They are to be worn one inch below the shoulder. We were issued with Enfield revolvers which are out of date and misfire now and again. Orders were issued that we were to take nothing more than could be carried on our backs. We wore our shorts, tunics and hats and full wed equipment, Officers as well as men.<br/>Forms had to be filled in as to next of kin and so on to be left at the base in case we were among the unfortunate ones not to return. Our boxes packed we sent them to Messers. Cooks, Cairo for safe keeping and I hope mine will be safe as all my papers are in it, certificates and credentials. Our departure was unexpected and rather hurried. If I remember right it was on Sunday that a full Parade of Officers and N.C.Os. was ordered and we were all marched to the parade by the Adjutant and formed into a square with the Officers and N.C.Os. of the other Battalions of the Bde. General Legge Commanding the 2nd Division gave us a very fine speech and wished General Holmes (Brigadier) and the Bde. the best of luck and hoped he  would join us soon.<br/>All leave was stopped and a careful roll call taken. Major O'Halloran was sent to the 3rd training Btn with Liet. Mc Donald. Captain Arnold was sent to the 19th and Captain Ross came to C" Company of the 20th.<br/>The change was in some ways advantageous but we all very much regretted Mc Donald leaving us and are assured that it was only ill feeling that caused the change to be made. For a Company to go into action for the first time short of two officers appears to me to be idiotic and the action of ignorant people.</p>
