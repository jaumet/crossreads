<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>Yesterday I arranged for our passages to Mudros and Anzac. We leave on Friday. All my heavy luggage will be stored with the Australian Military Head Quarters at Mustapha, Alexandria. You will know where to write about them in case of necessity. We take with us only our kit bags, and necessary articles.</p>
<p>How long I shall be in the region of the Aegean sea no one knows, but General Ford said that he did not expect me to be long away &amp; that he had other important work for me</p>
