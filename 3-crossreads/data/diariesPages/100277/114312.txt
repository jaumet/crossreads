set in a clump of nice trees there was a fine old castle, I could have looked on the beautiful landscape for hours, I was so wrapt up in France, however I was brought back to earth by a basket of French cake biscuits being thrust under my nose by a little French girl, these were very welcome for I was very hungry.
The Major let us rest here for nearly  an hour, he recognised the beauty of the place, gave us the full benefit of it, from here the road led down a pretty steep hill into the town itself, where the French or should I say the Flemish people were all out to see us march through their pretty little town
