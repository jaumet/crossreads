<p>Dear Mr. Garbutt</p>
<p>I received your letter dated 30..7..18 re &ndash; your son Joe who was in 110th Howitzer Battery Well Mr Garbutt you ask me did I know wether he died un the operation</p>
<p>Well Mr Garbutt after he was wounded he was carried straight away to the dressing station and that was the last we saw of him till two or three days time and word came through that he had died. So I cannot say wither he died through the Amputation or <strike>not</strike> wether it was before.</p>
<p>Yes Mr Garbutt he was quite Concious when he was carried</p>
