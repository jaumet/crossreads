 till the above date. It is hard to realize that after an absence of 3 &frac12; years from Australia, that a last a start is to be made for Home.  With a feeling of joy intermingled with a feeling of regret, I am leaving the Unit tomorrow, as it has been my home for so long, and I have made numerous friends, or I should say close "Pals", amongst its members, &amp; perhaps I will never see them again. 
 The move of the Draft for England (en route for Australia) from the 8th Field Ambulance on the 6th March 1919. 
 The party of 40 all told, consisting of 8th, 14th, 15th Field Ambulance, &amp; 5th Sanitary Section, paraded at 7.30 a.m. on the 6th inst. After bidding farewell to our "cobbers" we are leaving behind, we march to Solre le Chateau.  Here we board lorries and arrive at Beaumont about 11 a.m. Instead of staying the night at the military camp, we obtained permission from our worthy W.O. to have rooms in the town, so all had a comfortable bed for the night.

I managed to obtain a wooden bunk in the billet &amp; was fairly comfortable for the night.  Permission was granted to those who desired to have rooms in Charleroi;  but not being "flush" with money, I stopped in the camp. Breakfast at 7 a.m. on the 8th inst. &amp; at 9.30 a.m. we entrained.  Travelled in cattle trucks, &amp; without a doubt, they very best was done for the troops. Twenty five men to a truck, clean straw provided to sleep on, - and a bag of coal for the brazier. The rations were plentiful &amp; included plum puddings, coffee &amp; milk, &amp; tins of mixed biscuits. Tommie heaters were also on issue. Mons was the first stopping place, &amp; hot tea &amp; stew was partaken of here. There was goodly issue of rum in the evening. Another meal was obtained at
