The blankets and mattresses were swarming with fleas and lice, and . I remember finding a dead mouse in one of the pockets of my |coat - he had probably been after crumbs in my pocket and had  met his end in being lain on in my sleep.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning we received five minutes fresh air when we were taken out to wash etc.<br/>Under such conditions as these we were particularly  glad at the expiration of the fourteen days/ to receive our  limited freedom, for all told we had done six weeks gaol, and all the thought of our three pals by now probably in England - made us resolve to have another go for our liberty the first  chance that offered itself.</p>
