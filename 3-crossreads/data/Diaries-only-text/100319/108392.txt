2/10/18 Nauroy
A fine day. Cavalry advancing were seen by German aeroplanes who called artillery on to them and caused a grand scatter. A look in daylight round these strong positions makes one marvel how the Hun ever was got out of them. Waning morale is the only explanation I can advance. Great landscape views from here ? miles of rolling downs , ruined villages and the Canal du Nord running by all. Went to Bde H.Q. to a Conference at 1530 and there met the General other battalion commanders. We went into plans for the attack tomorrow morning. The 5th Bde (right) 7th Bde (left) are doing it. Zero 6.5 am. We shall probably take over the front line the same night. 21 22 in front. Hun bombed round here later but our a.a. work in the drizzly rain did no good. Bed 9.30.
