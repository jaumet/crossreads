 Dear Mother, 
 We have now arrived at Salisbury after being 10&frac12; week on the water.  We arrived at Liverpool on Sunday morning disembarked and boarded a train for here in the afternoon and came through Birmingham &amp; Oxford arriving here at 2 a.m. &amp; marched about two miles to our camp which were tents at about 4 a.m. we turned in for a few hours sleep.  The trip in the train was very pretty as we passed through green fields and crops which are just being cut, use is made of every little bit of ground for  for  something generally vegetables which are grown all along the line wherever
