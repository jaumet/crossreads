  
 GALLIPOLI, 3rd September 1915. 
 My dear Mother. 
 Just a few lines to say that we have been over here for about a fortnight and am thankful to say that I am still whole, in fact none of the Section have been wounded yet.  We have all of course, had some pretty narrow escapes, but a miss here is as good as a mile.  Where we are now, we are pretty safe, in fact practically the only danger is from Snipers, and you May be sure, we don't give them much of a show. 
 You of course understand that we are not allowed to say anything that might be interesting. 
 Arthur Adams is camped very close to us and also several other chaps I know well.  Major Martin is also near here, but have not seen him yet. 
 The flies here are simply awful, and it is a work of art to get some food to your mouth without half a dozen of them on it.  There are also some other of the insect tribes. 
 The food here is pretty good, in fact better than I expected;  that is of course under the circumstances. 
 I am sorry to say that is about the extent of the news I am allowed to say anything about, except of course I am well.  Address as usual to Egypt. 
 Harry wishes to be remembered to you all. 
 With love from Your Loving Son Roy. 
 Up to the time I left Egypt I had received your first letter and two from Ruby. 
 R.R.
