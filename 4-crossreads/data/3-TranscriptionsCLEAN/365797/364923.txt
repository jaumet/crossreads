  
 I have  some  news to tell you now. 
 Hazel is "hitched" 
 Ollie & her are going to be married on the 20th of April so on the 20th of April you will know that she is getting wedded. It is going to be at night, we are only having 20 guests &#64; the house (war time you know) Mother will tell you all about  it . 
 Excuse this ink but Hazel is using all the other. 
 Well, I must close now heaps of love from us all & tons from myself
