<p>Examinations this morning &ndash; This School would cost me a lot of money in Peace time &amp; I appreciate my luck in attending. If I could afford it I would keep up soldering after the War in Australia but am afraid I will have my daily bread to earn as usual.</p>
<p>Went Cairo Dinner &amp; to CASINO etc.</p>
<p>Laura tells me Nowell Forth is on his way here again.</p>
<p>Am giving Pearse of PASTORALISTS REVIEW some photos to take to Australia, he will send you the Paper when printed.</p>
