<p>Dec 7th</p>
<p>could ever imagine a place to be, but we struck plenty of Frenchmen &amp; had a good-time; we also struck up a yarn with some of the New Zealand troops, also Australians from different boats &amp; found out we have been having just as good a time as any of the other boats, some of the boys had a fair time for awhile riding donkeys &amp; as we all had spurs on, the donkeys got nothing;</p>
<p>About 11 oclock we ran against a picquet off the Suffolk.  we struck up a yarn with them &amp; found they were from Kensington (2nd Battalion)  I enquired after Morgan Welsh but they did not know him.  we came on board about midnight after having a good time &amp; it was quite a treat to be on land again.  7 weeks &amp; a day since we walked on land &amp; we are quite satisfied to leave the boat</p>
