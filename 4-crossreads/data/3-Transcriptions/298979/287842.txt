<p>that almost "at once" they were roughly roused, &amp; were informed "The Advance has gone"! Hastily rolling their oilsheets &amp; fastening them to the belt at the back, they could see the whole line advancing, and both hurried forward into their places.</p>
<p>Silently the line went forward, The sentry having been "told off" to see that the third platoon kept in touch with the second, had every now &amp; then to cast his eyes to the right &amp; left to see that the "line" was kept also the proper interval. Still silently the line went forward &amp; no sign of the enemy, nothing but a dark hedge like line away in the distance. The advance was being made down a gradual slope, through a large wheat field from which the grain had recently been mown &amp; harvested. Luckily the ground underfoot was perfectly smooth not having been in any way torn up with shell fire.</p>

Follow "him" "be d[dash]" &amp; such like expressions were muttered.</p>

How the men cursed that foolish officer with his "follow me" in a silent attack! Naturally the men "knew" that he was feeling very "queer" &amp; had to say something to steady his nerves. Still the line advanced</p>
