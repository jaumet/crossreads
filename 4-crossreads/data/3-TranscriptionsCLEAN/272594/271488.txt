  
 26th  Packed our greatcoat & strapped it on our haversack and marched out to support the 2nd Div in the hopover they are supposed to be making tonight, they told us it was only a matter of a couple of miles, but it was nearer six, I cant see the good of telling men these sorts of lies for it only makes them grumble & growl as they climb the never ending grassy ridges & see no sign of the joint in sight only more ridges stretching away in the distance
