 Bussy &ndash; la &ndash; Daours     D.R. At 6.30 am I received a call went across to Bonnay, Battery moved. Came home and had a quiet day. Went out on a run to Blaney Tronville and La Motte, during night  Fritz tried a stunt against 41st Batt, - he certainly came a cropper. Played cards until midnight &ndash; won.
