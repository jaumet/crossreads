Most of us only got the<br/>ribbons &amp; the medals are to come <strike>again</strike> along soon<br/>My ribbon is like this<br/>[Drawing with 7 sections alongside which is written]<br/>DARK BLUE<br/>WHITE<br/>RED<br/>WHITE<br/>RED<br/>WHITE<br/>DARK BLUE<br/>Practically the same colours as the French Red White &amp; Blue &amp; I believe the medals are very artistic &amp; of silver. Like all other war medals it &amp; the ribbon are worn on the left breast. Well dear thank you very much for your Cable of Congratulations. Sorry</p>
