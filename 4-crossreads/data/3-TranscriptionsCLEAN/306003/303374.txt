  
 31-5-16 prisoners, it is said the aeroplane dropped some bombs on the retreating Turks;  At 11.30 we left for Oghratina & arrived there at 1 oclock, had dinner & fed & watered the horses & left Oghratina at 4 oclock for camp & had a good trip in;  Most of the lads have had a lot of outpost duty & guards & fatigues since leaving camp the night before last & have had practically no time for sleeping & are about knocked up, but I have rather enjoyed the trip.  We arrived in camp at 8.30 had tea & bully beef before getting to bed 
 1-6-16 Thurs 1st Had quite an exciting time this morning which put more life into us than a days sleep;  Reveille at 3.30 as usual & had finished doing stables & waiting for the cooks to sing out for the mess orderlies for breakfast when the burr of an aeroplane was heard
