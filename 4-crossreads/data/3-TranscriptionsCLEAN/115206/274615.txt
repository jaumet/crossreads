 Messines Made two trips to F.O.O. today, gee but it's a long step. Made enquiries about E.G.F. and find he is at Spy Farm Weather has been very unsettled. Received a wire that Fritz was massing at Lake Farm .  Our Bty put 20 rounds in.  Had the 2 to 4 this morning. Feeling fairly tired after so much travelling today, so I must drink my run and pop into bed.
