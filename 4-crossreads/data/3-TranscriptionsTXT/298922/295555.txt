Leave granted 3 weeks in England - I will cable from Cairo . "Convalescent 6 weeks leave England" it will take 3 travelling. I am so thankful - don't know boat till I report. I go ITALY & FRANCE so if not torpedoed a splendid trip. I am certainly a very lucky man & will Cable you my arrival in England.
It just happened our Brigade is doing nothing hence I got leave & a lot may happen in 6 weeks. Love to you. I'm saddling up now!!!
