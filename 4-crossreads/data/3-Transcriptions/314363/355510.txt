We did not see a great deal of it as the time was short, but we saw shells in the making &amp; guns of all sizes, it was very interesting. We had a very nice tea at the canteen in the grounds, provided free. Comming out of the Arsenel, we had a look round the city, which is a much nicer place than Dartford then pictures again. Before going in to the Arsenel we had to give up all cigarettes &amp; matches, as a precautionary measure.<br/>There was great excitement over the taking of Ostend &amp; Bruges</p>
