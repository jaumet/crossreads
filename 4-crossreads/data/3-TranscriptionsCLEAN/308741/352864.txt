 Charlie Waterhouse has been killed and one of the Searles has gone home to Sydney.  Both come from Auburn & know you I think. 
 Well, I'll look forward to hearing from you shortly.  At present I'm under isolation, as some mug in the hut has mumps, so I am filling in the time reading again Homer's Odyssey and the Iliads, which are the best sleep producers, barring howitzer shells, I know of. 
 Your old Pal Arthur
