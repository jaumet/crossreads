lad in my ward just now with overstrain of heart - Cpl F. H. Jones of the 20th; from 42 Coltenham St, Glebe, his mother lives in Cobargo - he helped to carry poor Arthur in; a large shell - 5.9 he thinks - hit the dug out & Arthur was killed instantly. He was buried next day in Bois Grenier burying ground: Lieut Evans of C Company took charge of his watch & other effects.
Probably you have all particulars about him already, but if I see any patient from the 20th I shall ask to see if I can find out anything you might wish to know. Jones is very short of breath owing to irregular heart but is improving & I hope in time
