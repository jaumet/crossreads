<p>July 1915<br/>Wednesday 7<br/><u>Fine</u> Went down to pier about 6 AM and left it about 6.30 PM. Nothing doing all day. We were hauled out suddenly by the Corporal to go and pump water for the carts from 7 PM until 9 PM as the tanks had got a bit low. Just now the hospital is short of water but it will be remedied in a few days.</p>
<p>Thursday 8<br/>Fine and cool. I go in for a bathe every day. The water is shallow for ever so far out. Even a learner would be safe on his own at 300 yds out. Our food supply is good in our new quarters. The evening and nights are beautifully cool</p>
