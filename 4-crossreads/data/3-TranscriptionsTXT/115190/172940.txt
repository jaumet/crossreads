mile after mile the atmosphere redolent of dead Turk as usual.  At night fall we camp on a ridge near the road & outposts are put out.  It is my first turn on I am first for duty & I sit with the receiver to my ear.  A cold wind is blowing & I hear the occasional crack of a rifle & the rat a tat tat of a machine gun.  The Brigadier is lying on his blankets just near me & I hear him ask the Brigade major if he would like some jam on his biscuit.  Just then I get the news through that Bulgaria has surrendered & call out to the General, who thanks me & passes the good news on.  I dont feel very well tonight & am aching & shivering all over.  When relieved I scoop the rocks away with my foot & lay down by the old mare & sleep a feverish sleep.
