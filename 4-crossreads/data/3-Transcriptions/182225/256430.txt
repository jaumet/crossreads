<p>Raining &amp; blowing &amp; very cold. Revielle at 4 pm &amp; we moved off at 6.30 &amp; took up a position about 3 miles away &amp; supported our battallion (33<sup>rd</sup>). The waggon lines were at the stables here, so we all came back with the teams &amp; then had to take the first line waggons out. We finished up about 4 pm after a good day. I was on stable picket at night</p>
