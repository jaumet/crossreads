It has been fairly cold all week a shade of snow last night & several heavy frosts.
A big crowed of 15 men in yesterday but they have gone again so things are quiet.  A Company of 3rd Pioneers are here working, several of my old mates amongst them.  Whaley is away on leave so have his work as well as my own to do.  Missed bookeeping class this morn.
