<p>FORCE ORDER</p>
<p>(SPECIAL)</p>
<p>General Headquarters,</p>
<p>21st April, 1915.</p>
<p>Soldiers of France and of the King!</p>
<p>Before us lies an adventure unprecedented in modern war. Together with our comrades of the Fleet we are about to force a landing upon an open beach in face of positions which have been vaunted by our enemies as impregnable.</p>
<p>The landing will be made good, by the help of God and the Navy; the positions will be stormed, and the War brought one step nearer to a glorious close.</p>
<p>&quot;Remember&quot; said Lord Kitchener when bidding adieu to your Commander, &quot;remember, once you set foot upon Gallipoli Peninsula, you must fight the thing through to a finish.&quot;</p>
<p>The whole world will be watching our progress. Let us prove ourselves worthy of the great feat of arms entrusted to us.</p>
<p>Ian Hamilton,</p>
<p>General.</p>
