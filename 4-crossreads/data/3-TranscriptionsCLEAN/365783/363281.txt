I do hope that some of the fruit will be ripe before you leave. I would not keep the additional man too long, the place should be well looked after by one man alone. If he cannot look after it properly someone else must replace him. My heartiest congratulations to Peter on getting the three T's (top tooth through) I have noted Tottie Langley's address. I had a note from Mrs Patterson asking me out & went there on Sunday afternoon & stayed to tea. They have both got thin - Charlie does not look too good but he never did look too healthy. Mrs Langley & Miss Lulu were also there. I enjoyed the afternoon very much - they are very keen for you to look them up on your way through.
