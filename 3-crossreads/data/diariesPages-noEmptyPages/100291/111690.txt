1917 Tuesday 28 August
Afternoon off. Take it easy read write sleep a little Terrific gale of wind rain raged all day.
Great excitement about tea time. A sailing vessel blown ashore on rocks below cliff. Thousands watch her being pounded to pieces. 4 of the crew rescued after great difficulty. Rockets life line. Wind blowing hurricane force.
