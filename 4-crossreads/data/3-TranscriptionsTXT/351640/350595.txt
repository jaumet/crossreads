 The moon is at the full in the Northern Hemisphere, rising from the Eastern sky, it is now 10-45 p.m. high in the heavens, and seen through my window, from where I sit, is as a ringed flat surface of variegated pale blue, the size of five shilling piece, shedding clear unwarmed rays upon the pyradmids and all the land of Egypt, round about these parts.

 Your loving &amp; affectionate father John B. Nash
