13/5/18 Franvillers 
During last night there were several air raids and a good many bombs were dropped roundabout. The morning broke wet and continued to rain. I sent King out in search of billets and he eventually got to Martigny where we will be able to get our old officers? billets. Walked over and saw Colonel Brazenor who is camped in a tent beside a grassy bank. They have pinched some marquees ! No wonder the reputation for horse thieving is not peculiar to Australians. They have other qualities. Received a summons to Bde H.Q. regarding a proposed stunt on Ville sur Ancre. Met Colonel Brazenor and with him rode to Heilly where at the cottage all the other C.Os. were assembled. The General unfolded plans for an attack to be carried out by 22nd on a front of 1250" to a maximum depth of 750" having for objective the trench system known as the Caterpillar. We fully discussed the plans and decided to launch the assault at 2 am or one good hour before dawn. Barrage to travel fairly rapidly as the going is so good. Determined on 48 hours after relief as the best time to do it. The Division opposite us is tired and a letter found on a dead man says "The Australians are opposite us. They are cunning and alert and creep up to our trenches
