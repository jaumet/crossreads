We will be leaving our own mess down here very shortly - arrangements have been made with a French chef who has had as clients, princes, dukes & marquises to cater for us for 8 piastres (1/8) per day per person.   I have not seen a great deal of Fred, he is a night duty hospital orderly & sleeps during the daytime when I am usually about.   I saw Mick a few days ago - he wants to transfer from his battalion to this unit - Fred also spoke to me about changing over to one of the infantry battalions.   I saw Concanon for a few minutes the other day - he seems to be in very good form.  I have not yet ascended the Pyramids but hope to do so very soon - they are very weird looking things.   We are having beautiful moonlight nights just now & as I lie in my bed at night & I look through the doorway of my tent I see the great mass of stones right in front of me.   There is plenty going on around us - hundreds of horses from the lighthorse tents come twice daily to a huge horse trough right alongside us - there are several Arab villages not very far distant & along the road leading to them there is a constant stream of camels laden with all sorts of things, natives riding donkeys & mules & men women & children of all sizes & colours.   I have had no letters since arriving here but am looking forward to getting some very shortly.With best love to all & hoping you are all real wellYour loving husbandWill.
