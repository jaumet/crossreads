<p>OFFICERS AND MEN.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Navy, we are about to undertake one of the most difficult tasks any soldier can be called on to perform, and a problem which has puzzled many soldiers for years past. That we will succeed I have no doubt, simply because I know your full determination to do so.  Lord Kitchener has told us that he lays special stress on the role the Army has to play in this particular operation, the success of which will be a very severe blow to the enemy, &ndash;  indeed, as severe as any she could receive in France. It will go down to history to the glory of the soldiers of Australia and New Zealand.  Before we start, there are one or two points which I must impress on all, and I most earnestly beg every single man to listen attentively and take these to heart.<br/>We are going to have a real hard and rough time of it until, at all events, we have turned the enemy out of our first objective. Hard rough times none of us mind, but to get through them successfully we must always keep before us the following facts. Every possible endeavour will be made to bring up transport as often as possible;  but the country whither we are bound is very difficult, and we may not be able to get our wagons any where near us for days, so men must not think their wants have been neglected if they do not get all they want.  On landing it will be necessary for every individual to carry with him all his requirements in food and clothing for three days, as we may not see our transport till then.  Remember then that it is essential for everyone to take the very greatest care not only of his food, but of his ammunition, the replenishment of which will be very difficult.  Men are liable to throw away their food the first day out and to finish their water bottles as soon as they start marching.  If you do this now, we can hardly hope for success, as unfed men cannot fight and you must make an effort to try and refrain from starting on your water bottles until quite late in the day.  Once you begin drinking you cannot stop and a water bottle is very soon emptied.<br/>Also as regards ammunition &ndash; you must not waste it by firing away indiscriminately at no target. The time will come when we shall find the enemy in well entrenched positions from which we shall have to turn them out, when all our ammunition will be required; and remember,</p>
<p>Concealment whenever possible,<br/>Covering fire always,<br/>Control of fire and control of your men,<br/>Communications never to be neglected.</p>

<p>Have been exceedingly busy these last two days in obtaining fresh provisions from the store Ships in the Bay.  As nearly all Troopships are now beginning to run out of supplies etc, its hard work to obtain any &amp; one is liable to get killed in the crush.</p>
<p>There is going to be some great work in this attack on the Dardanelles &amp; I suppose everyone in Australia will know all</p>
