<p>Monday May 12th at Sea</p>
<p>up anchor &amp; away about noon to the strains of our band : foggy &amp; misty rain so couldn't get a photo of anything : struck a decent roll on : slept on deck &amp; it was nice :</p>
<p>Tuesday May 13th at Sea</p>
<p>decent roll on &amp; plenty of the lads were sick : I felt a bit squeamish but didn't miss any meals &amp; managed to keep them all down : seen a couple of small whales :</p>
<p>Wednesday May 14th at Sea</p>
<p>usual   routine : calmer sea so we settled ourselves down to things : good library opened</p>
