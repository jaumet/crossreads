21/9/17 Westhoek
line is about  mile ahead of here ? a really splendid advance and done by some units with hardly any losses. The evening was very quiet and permitted a tremendous lot of movement hereabout. Walked back to our horses noticing some of our own dead with arms and legs off and took to the saddle of Birr X. Three Taubes came over and did some grand bomb dropping sending up several dumps. Made the pace back to camp reaching same about 3.30 desperately hungry and athirst. Rapidly issued orders for our move forward at 5. Rested a little and at 5 commenced our intervalled march to China Wall and tucked the chaps away there. Just at dusk the S.O.S went up the Germans delivering a counterattack on what seemed to be a big front. We got into touch with BdeHQ at once and I decided to stay still until the bombardment stopped. We were very well out of it
