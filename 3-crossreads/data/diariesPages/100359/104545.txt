Lord above, reveille at 5 again. They are making it jolly hot. All hands at work pitching more tents and cleaning up the camp generally. No mail has come in yet, so my long looked for photo has not arrived. There's some talk of us going away very soon. Wrote long letter to Lill. also send P.C. to Kath and Dave. Mail came in got letter and Photo from Lill. Letters from France, Mother, Ernest, Peter, France and also sent Bulletin. Just after "lights out" the Alarm was sounded and we all turned out in full marching order. Every man was out fully dressed and all ready with stretchers to move off at a minutes notice, but it was only a practice alarm, and we all returned to out virtuous couches.
Monday 8th
"Reveille" at 5 again. Fall in at 6.15 stretcher drill and practising loading the patients on camels and in the sand carts. I would not care to be badly wounded and brought in on a camel, as they give a man a rough ride.
