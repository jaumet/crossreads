After this was over the Colonel called the Battalion to "attention" asked for all those who landed with the Battalion on the Peninsular to "slope arms", of the 1200 odd men who jumped out of those boats, but 17 were here today, it is then that one realizes how lucky he has been thanks his lucky stars he is still going strong, after this we marched off home all were heartily glad to get rid of our heavy packs.
This afternoon was a holiday so I took advantage of it to wash a shirt go down with a pair of trousers to the Battn tailor to get them altered, on the way down I was pulled up by a dozen or so officers for congratulation in the town I met Capt Edgeley he was smiling all over his face he said I suppose we will have to congratulate one another, he asked me did I know the color of the ribbon, I told him I did not, he said no one seems to know any
