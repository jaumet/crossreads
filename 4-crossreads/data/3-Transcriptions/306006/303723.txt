<p>29-1-17<br/>Mon 29th<br/>Was rather surprised this morning when Capt Parry came around to hear I was fit to go back to the Regt. So got my belongings together &amp; made back to our old camp &amp; had a quiet day;</p>
<p>The Regt arrived back at 3 oclock this afternoon, they were relieved by the 5th Yeomanry Brigade who also took out 2 Batteries of Artillery with then &amp; enough Camel transports to move a Division.</p>
<p>30-1-17<br/>Tue 30th<br/>Two 60 pounder guns were brought up into position today by B.H.Q. nothing out of the ordinary happened my throat is still far from well &amp; I am not feeling too fit;</p>
