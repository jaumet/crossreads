  
 Saturday June 30 Swimming Parade to Bitta lakes some 2 miles from Camp. Our march lay through main camp & dump at Moascar. Camp absolutely packed with thousands of troops proceeding to the line. Aussies, NZ. Scotchmen, Irishmen, Londoners etc. Average Tommy seems a little cove compared to Australians & N.Z. New Zealanders struck me as a particularly fine body of men, well built, big & seemed fine fellows. Our way lay along a well made metalled road leading to Ismalia with the sweet water canal alongside the road. It is remarkable the traffic along this shallow canal. Barges very unwieldy vessels, manned by Egyptians (usually pretty dirty) carry surprising loads of Horse fodder & rations. We crossed over the Canal at London
