Mollie dear:/
Did I write to you anything about the birth place of Moses?  I think not further than just mentioning the event.Exodus II - "2 . And when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months."
To understand this sentence it is necessary to set down an earlier one.Ex I. "22 And Pharoh charged all his people, saying, - Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive."
The object was to destroy the Israelites who were then living and thriving in the land of Egypt, ruled over by Pharoah.
II - "3.  And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.""4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him""5.  And the daughter of Pharoah came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.""6. And when she had opened it, she saw the child; and, behold, the babe wept.  And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrew's children.""7 Then said his sister to Pharoah's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
