The names of the horses are still in frames on the wall in each stall;  Some of the names are Lydie, Courcelette, Black, Tom.  The feed place was enamelled iron, likewise the drinking vessel.  The garden is destroyed;  a garden path with an avenue of apple trees trained on trellis work, were cut down with an axe.  All fruit trees in orchard blown down with explosives, the only fruit not toutched are the currant bushes.  They are loaded with green fruit.  The green house is in one mass of ruins, flower pots strewn everywhere, and to cap all, between 500 and 600 Germans are buried in the front garden.  What troubled the owner most was the felling of the trees in the wood surrounding the Chateau.  Hundreds were chopped down falling across the road.  This wood was also used by Huns for horse lines.</p>
