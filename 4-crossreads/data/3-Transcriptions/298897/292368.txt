<p>scene one of which flying to a great height above the balloon did a beautiful spiral dive down to it, evidently firing into it.  As he passed it someone jocularly said he's gone clean through it then as he passed it when climbing up again he's gone through the same hole.  However the balloon then burst into flames falling to earth a mass of flames.  'Twas a grand sight, first a faint flicker of light which spread rapidly until the whole was sheathed in flame reaching hundreds of feet above, the downfall being greeted with a mighty cheer from the watchers</p>
<p>Friday 29th Sept.<br/>Very damp &amp; cool day which somewhat marred the divisional show (horse) &amp; sports.  Competition was very keen in best turned out vehicles most of the prizes being won by the A.S.C.  They would have done credit to any coach builder of Sydney.  Other events were best hacks, jumping etc etc all of which was first class &amp; at times very funny.  The mule jumping competition was the best in this respect several of them playing up somewhat.  The show ended with a perfect exhibition of riding a buckjumper by a typical Australian.</p>
