<p>reached 70 kilos. ( a kilo = 2lbs 3 &frac12;  ozs) (87)<br/>Thursday 27" July (9pm)<br/>This afternoon I went on a tour of inspection round the city of Boulonge - sur - Mer. I found St John's Church of England, H&ocirc;tel de ville, Palais de Justice, Th&eacute;&acirc;tre municipal, Jardin des Tintelleries, City tennis courts. Spent an interesting quarter of an hour at the fire station (H&ocirc;tel des pompiers)) when fire drill was on. The firemen are soldiers from the garrison. Went over "the Ch&acirc;teau" now used as French headquarters &amp; barracks. Had a look at the underground chapel and also a number of subterranean passageways &amp; vaults which extend under the whole city so my guide, a friendly French private told me. The Chateau is  entered from the upper or old city, i.e. from the ramparts in</p>
