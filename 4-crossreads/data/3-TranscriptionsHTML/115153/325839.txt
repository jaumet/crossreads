<p>I also visited the Theatres and picture shows in various parts of the city, and found them to be so much in the Australian style that I thought at times I was in a show somewhere in Melbourne.</p>
<p>In the meantime our Boat had coaled and was ready to depart again, but was delayed a few hours owing to some of the Men not reporting back to the Vessel in time , and even then we had  to leave a few men behind us.</p>
<p>Just after leaving Capetown one of our men created a sensation by jumping overboard when he was in a state of the Horrors, which had set in after a drinking bout.

The Padre for instance was a tall lean man well over six feet; he was charged with breach of Military Regulations in that he enlisted under the height , which of course  was ridiculous in reality, and in the case of a very small man, he was charged with enlisting over the height.

<p>Another few days steaming and we arrived at St. Vincent, a town on the island of St. Vincent in the group of Cape Verde Islands, which lies off Cape Verde the most westerly point of the African</p>
