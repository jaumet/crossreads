 Tuesday, 18 May, 1915 Arrived at Imbros found it to be another island inhabited by one light house, all  the other boats arrived here as we are safe from shells but submarine precautions are taken.  The joke of the lot was when the old [indecipherable]  with drivers came alongside.  None of us know our future intentions but we are having a fine holiday on this boat away from horses, all we do is read sleep play cards and yet we are supposed to be on government rations, but we are living like saloon passengers.  I cooked a leg of ham for dinner, it was a triumph men ate the lot.  We hear that the British are doing well in the war of the hill but the French are no good at all twice they have lost positions what the British have won.  The Indians are doing good work with their mountain batteries. We had a lecture on Ceylon at night by Chaplain Miles we have all the chaplains on board, little Capt Dexter went with the Inf the night before, the men adore him, he did better work with the wounded than all the doctors, dressing wounds and [indecipherable], he worked 2 days and 2 nights. 
 Wednesday, 19 May. Left Imbros for Carpa [Gaba] Tepe the scene of operations where there was a terrific battle raging.  The Turks have been heavily reinforced and they attacked the Auss position repeatedly only to get driven back and mown down in thousands.  The slaughter was terrific on one occasion the Austs allowed the Turks to approach within 30 yards before firing shots then set the Light Horse machine guns on them with fearful results.  The Turks shrapnel fire was very effective and settled a lot of our fellows.  We got orders to convert our boat into a hospital ship and go right in and get wounded.  we went right in and were at once greeted by a shell right across our bows. [indecipherable]. 
 We brought the bad cases off the lighter up in a sling and cradle and before we had one lot's wounds dressed another load would arrive.  We all worked like niggers, I was stretcher bearing and laying out beds on the deck and feeding the patients before I was called into the operating theatre, it was a regular shambles.  I witnessed twenty amputations of arms legs etc as well as the removal of eyes and organs.  I saw the lot and it was a pleasure to watch Col Ryan and Capt Fiaschi with the knife.  Wounded kept arriving until after midnight including Turkish prisoners, they are cared for the same as our own.  I was detailed off to sit up all night in a cabin with a N.Z. Lieutenant Logan who had a compressed fracture of the skull, the operation did not succeed and after a night of struggling and agony the poor brave young fellow died in my arms at 5 a.m. without gaining consciousness.
