<p>Gallipoli<br/>Anzac<br/>Nov 3rd 1915</p>
<p>Dear Judge Ferguson<br/>Yr letter only reached me at Heliopolis where I was detained thru illness, &amp; cd not come on here with the Batt. But I am glad to say I am now quite well &amp; trying to do my best here with my men. I found them in good form but a number have gone sick since they took up this position, go sick among this number &amp; today our strength is 730. We on list receive our 3rd Reinforcements, they were sent to the 18th Battn, which had had a bad time but our 4th are I hear now in Egypt, &amp; will soon be across to join us, and we are wanting them. I am very pleased to Report that we received a good consignment of Ref. comforts yesty (about 8 cases) &amp; have distributed them to the men, the warm articles were much appreciated. Mr Burren at fairs had charge of them &amp; I understand he is the Authority there to receive &amp; forward on these refreshments. To facilitate transhipment it is best to have the cases one size, about the same size of a Kerosene Can but shd be securely bound and well stencilled address, on at least two sides of case. I'd advise having stencil plate cast &amp; let <u>20th Battn</u> in large letters. We are in position known as Russells Top a very important post, but have orders this morning to hand over to 26th Batt &amp; go into rest quarters for a time</p>
