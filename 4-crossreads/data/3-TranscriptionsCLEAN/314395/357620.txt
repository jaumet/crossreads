 Its quite a different feeling when you know you are being shot at, to when the shells are falling indiscriminately  but  and surrounded by a mile of open country is quite another proposition.  After about an hour & a half he stopped, having concluded, I think, that we were "napoo", and we hopped out & tried our speed.  We were surprised at him using so many shells for two men, but on that part, the only targets he gets are occasional working parties so perhaps he had the time and ammunition to spare. 
 9.7.16.  I did not finish this letter as we got a sudden order to move.  I won't be able to write again for about a week and as we are on the track I will post this at once as half a letter now is better than two next week.  Starting on a 100 mile journey by road.  Presumably North. 
 Your affect. Son George
