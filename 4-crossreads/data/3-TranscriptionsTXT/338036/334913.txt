 [8th June contd] Prussian Guards had counter attacked but were cut up.  The Hun put over liquid gas shells and every other shell he knew but without shifting our boys.  Here the excellent work of the Y.M.C.A might again be mentioned for but for them we would not have had a bite of food during the day of attack &amp; following days.  Back to Torquet Berth at 6 pm &amp; sleep. 
 Saturday 9th  [June] After rising we did not all go out as usual but two parties went out into Old nomans land and I have to take 4 men out tomorrow at 6 am.  Received the sad news that Jack Hoskins had died of wounds.  The other ambulances also fared very badly.  The 11th Fld Amb lost about 21 wounded or killed &amp; 11th Fld Amb about 8 out of action. Saw the account of fighting in paper today &amp; it looks good.  About 600 tons of explosive was used &amp; 20 mines exploded.  The work of our Flying Corps was admirable and during the week of advance over 40 enemy planes were settled by our boys.  Gas again tonight. 
 Sunday 10th Things were very warm all day shrapnel &amp; HE.
