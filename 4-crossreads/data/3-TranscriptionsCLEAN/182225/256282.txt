 1916   MONDAY 12   JUNE 
 A fair day but a bit cool & there were a few showers. They started coaling from lighters in morning & were at it all day. They coaled with niggers & there were some cases amongst them. We gave them some roast beef & put a lot of cayenne pepper in it, they eat it all and some minutes after they began to rub their bellies as the pepper was burning them. We went for a row in one of the ships boats in the afternoon. We went round the "Benalla" with the 35 th /  NE & some AMC men on her and round the pier & back to the ship. It was a great change. Everybody very excited as there is a roumer we go ashore tomorrow.
