Horses moving &amp; transport etc.  Aeroplanes have been busy all day &amp; we counted 16 shrapnel shells fired at one man all of which appeared to us to miss badly.  The Fort on the Cape is a mass of ruins, as is also several buildings in the vicinity.  We can plainly see the ship which was specially prepared &amp; run ashore to assist in the landing of the troops.  Three large holes were cut in each side to allow of guns being used.  We have seen a dummy battleship known as H.M.S. Tiger No 2  She carries one genuine gun the rest being dummies  About midday the Turks commenced firing from the Asiatic side &amp; one shell landed close to the camp but one of our guns replying, it was soon silenced.  Towards evening we disembarked the Hospital onto a mine sweeper &amp; then returned to the old spot &amp; anchored for the night all lights being muffled.</p>

In the evening our Doctor &amp; Ships Captain were taken off &amp; various latrines were immediately floated.</p>
