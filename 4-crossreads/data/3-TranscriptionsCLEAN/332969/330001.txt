To No.1 stationary Hospital. on North beach where I stayed until the 1st Dec & was taken on a stretcher in a launch out to a Hospital ship & put a board where they found "Diptheris" was my complaint I can tell you I was very bad & did not know anything until the 4 Dec. 15 when they took me off the boat at "Alexandria" & took me to the 19th General Hospital "Alexandria". 
 I have been here some weeks now in Hospital. I am beginning to feel myself now. The nurses are very good to us all & they gave us a very pleasant Xmas. Its a beautiful Hospital & was once a German Hospital. 
 14.2.16 Well I arrived back to my old unit yesterday. & I can tell you. there was a great re union among old mates.  We are ho  at Tel-el-Kebi. We are having a good old time as we are in tents. I have been down to the old Cemetery where a lot of men are burried who fell in the battle of Tel-el-Kebi. the remains of the old trenches are still to be seen around the camp. The train line runs quite close to the camp.
