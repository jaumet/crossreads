 I suppose Keith is beginning to fidget again.  I don't know whether to think he is lucky or not.  There are some goods points in being over here. 
 I have just written 5 letters and am feeling a bit exhausted with the strain.  Thanks very much for the last parcel.  Best love to the Judge, Dorothy & Keith. 
 Yours affectionately C. R. Lucas
