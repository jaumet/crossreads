Havre
Today the men were put through a cleansing process ? bathed reclothed steamed deloused and all their equipment taken from them. For me there was nothing doing and it was simply a day of loaf. In the evening we moved about  mile to another camp. The surrounding high ground all wood covered and very pretty. The Frenchman seems to place his houses very artistically and chooses fine vistas.

Another very fine summery day. Motor lorries busily puffing about with kits blankets. Did nothing all day but at 5.30 pm went down to No. 3 Camp and met Major Storey and Red Cross Hayes. By motor lorry went into Havre. A nice run to the old port of Harfleur which is rich in historical memories. Saw an old field where one of the Henrys had a battle hundreds of years since. Reached Havre about 6
