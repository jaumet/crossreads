<p>seen the 'Times' reports. I tried very hard to follow the summing up but could not make anything out of it. Maud Alan appears to have conducted herself in the witness box as admirably as she did in Sydney a few years ago.</p>
<p>I have just written seven other letters and so feel rather proud of myself.</p>
<p>Practically all effects of the gas have now disappeared and by the time I have had a bit of leave I should be quite fit to carry on again</p>
<p>Best Love to everyone<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
