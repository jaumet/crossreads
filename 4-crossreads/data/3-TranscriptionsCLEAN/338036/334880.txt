Saturday 26th [May]Fritz made it exceptionally warm all the morning and on two occasions I had narrow squeaks.  First one - I had just finished shaving - at door of dugout - when whizz-bang and had I not unconsciously ducked, my head would have stopped a number of flying pieces.  As it was I got a shower of leaves & sprigs from the tree I was under.  A few minutes later I was standing in the trench cooking some rice when bang - and I thought my last hour had come.  When I ventured to obtain the culprit that had shocked me I found piece of a nose cap from one of Fritz anti aircraft shells
