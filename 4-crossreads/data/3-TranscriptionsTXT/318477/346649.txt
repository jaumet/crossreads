 I've been lately thinking over Bil the Kaiser The man that wants to rule the Land &amp; sea Now when I think of Balmy bil the Kaiser I wonder does he think the same of me. in fighting he is very fond of fireling [firing?] John Bull will find his points without a doubt. Now here's a man with fame as bad as Nero's What do you think of him I like to know. 
 Now all you have to do is to boo boo boys When I ask you what you think of Kaiser Bil. In fact well you can call him what you like Boys And when your's on your own I know you will, Your often heard him speak in praise of heroes, in chorusus you will let your voices rise, Before he has a chance to throw towel in Count up to nine &amp; put the blighter out.
