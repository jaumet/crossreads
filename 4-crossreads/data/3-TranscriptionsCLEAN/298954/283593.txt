The linen is immaculate, the white enamelled beds the acme of comfort, but food is scarce.
With me is another Australian, Frank Bowell of Melbourne (15th Batt) two or three English & a few Russkis.   Distant big guns have been at work during yesterday and today & the air patrol over Kiel seems to be well kept up.
Tue. 5th MarchThe old Doc. paid me a visit a few days ago, and my stock has risen miles above par. with Schwester Kate and her mob since he deposited himself and his brilliant uniform on the foot of my bed and gossipped about things in general.
He took Kate to tea on the "Wolf" & told her to do her best for me and the Vinegary Virgin now fusses round & makes tea for us, etc.   But the poor devils in the Barracks are having a dreadful time.
