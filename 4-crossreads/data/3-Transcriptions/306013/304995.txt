<p>in case somebody might steal it, but daddy Christmas was kind all the same.</p>
<p><u>Dec 25. Xmas day.</u>    Of all the Christmas days I have yet spent this has been the most novel, the most full of deep experience, and by no means the least happy. It lasted for about 19 &frac12; hours, during which time not a moment was wasted. Far from home &amp; love ones we found much to make up for our loss, although many of the real, true characteristics of this Season were necessarily lacking. However the day was so full of action &amp; feeling that we forget what we were losing by being absent from our home-circle for Xmas for the first time.</p>
<p>Even the military authorities, with their unfeeling discipline, paid heed to the nature of the Season and gave us for breakfast 2 boiled eggs &amp; a slice of bacon each. Some of the boys were away so I had 3 eggs, and very nice too!!!   Then we paraded in single file &amp; had a tin of 50 cigarettes given to each of us, at the expense of our Comforts Fund. As I have given up the smoking, Alan</p>
