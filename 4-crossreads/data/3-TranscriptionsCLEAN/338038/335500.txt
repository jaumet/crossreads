you will believe my object in writing to you may be looked on as merely asking a question, an answer to which I do not know from whom else to seek better than yourself.  I will only further ask you to pardon me if I have wearied you with much writing and to forgive it as the desire of the father of one of the best sons who ever brightened a home to follow him beyond grave in endeavour to do for him in death what my love for him prompted me to do while he was yet alive the best I could in his interest.Again offering you and the officers of the 4th my heartfelt thanks and those of my familyI am dear Genl. BurgessYours sincerelyW.N. Garling
