well again.  Very little work.  Major Matson in lines yesterday, no complaints.  Making a start on stables today.
30.9.1916   Major Matson A.D.V.S. and Colonel Wilson Vet officers, in lines this evening.  Everything wrong, horses not groomed, Shoeing wrong, talking about angles of the feet.  These English officers have got the Australians set, and every chance they get they rub it in.  Colonel Anderson also inspected our horses   Too many heads on this job.  As I write this a terrific bombardment has just started.  8 P.M. exactly.  Rumoured that a 36 hours bombardment is coming off.  Having a try for Hill 60, a real death trap.  The Canadians got cut up there.  We are on low ground.  Lost a G.S. wagon last night, got up near the supports, and capsized into a ditch.  The mule team got to wagon line at 6 oclock this morning.
