<p>their shirts and look for live stock, which makes the onlooker very itchy.  The grave completed they lay a couple of blankets at the bottom of the grave and lay the body in a comfortable position.  The mouth of the grave is then covered with wide boards, so as not to allow the earth to fall in.  A mound is then built on top of the boards and a stick with pars written in pencil acts as a headstone.  Plenty of enthusiasm is put into the singing during the proceedings.</p>
<p>About four or five miles from our Camp is a village where there are hot sulphur baths.  Was going over to-day but is too wet, though some of the boys have taken the risk.</p>
<p>Your letter of the 26th October arrived a few days ago, also Mother's and Ruby's of a week later.  Glad to hear everybody is O.K. and that Charlie had got through all right.  Hope none of you are starting to worry at all over me.  I certainly had more than my share of narrow shaves on the Peninsular, but we are not there now and have no idea as yet where we are going to next or how long we will be here.  My arm is quite O.K. again, but at the time of leaving it was not strong enough to carry any weight, consequently I had to drop my pack and arrived here with only practically what I stand up in.  Fortunately, thanks to the Comforts, I am all right as regards Socks and shirts etc.</p>
<p>I was rather interested in one little item you sent along.  Hope She is young and none of the others have cleared out with her before I get a chance.</p>
<p>Pleased to see Wool is selling well and hope it will continue.  Suppose sales will be restricted the same as laAt Season.  Have not heard from Fleming yet.  Some of his sheep must have got out while he was talking to the Guard.</p>
<p>Best wishes to everybody in the Office including the extra.</p>
<p>Love to all at home from</p>
<p>Your affectionate Son,<br/>Pte 1280 Roy Richards.</p>
<p>Would you please send me along a new pipe.<br/>R.R.</p>
