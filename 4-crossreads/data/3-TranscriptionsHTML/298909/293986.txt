<p>31/5/16  Wednesday</p>
<p>Hot &amp; dusty &ndash; Had a route march &amp; heavy drill on the desert. 4th &amp; 5th Artillery moved out &ndash; The Royal Sussex Reg't moved in &ndash; one fellow gave me a badge for half a loaf of bread &ndash; We are not at all displeased at not moving &ndash; as we hope to have so much less time bivouacking at Moaska &ndash; We found a set of gloves &amp; had some rare sport. I found a bottle branded O.O. Whiskey, but was disappointed as it was Kerosene; I made an improvised lamp out of a Fruit Tin, so we can now have a read of at night, have just found a good book "Lorna Doone".</p>
