<p>1916<br/>Sept 28<br/>duration of the war, and three months after.<br/>That day about a hundred men left for Goulburn camp.   We did not know where we were booked for but hoped that it would be somewhere handy.   We slept in the Draught Stallions Pavilion, about six to a stall, with a couple of blankets each and a mattress of straw.   Sol Green had heard that men were frequently picked for the artillery from the recruits in the Show Grounds, so every time a whistle blew, he would be out like a shot, to fall in with whatever party was falling in.   He thudded several times for fatigue, and the boys getting to know of his obsession, used to whistle outside our stall and call out loudly "Fall in all those who wish to join the Artillery" for the pleasure of seeing him bounce out.   Fred Elliott the man that joined up immediately after enlisting was an adept at it.  He slept in our stall.<br/>Sept 29<br/>On the morning of the 29th Sept. I woke up about 4.30 am</p>
