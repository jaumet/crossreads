<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Dull winter has fled&quot; &amp; though the Australians were not responsible for his rout they are nevertheless very pleased at his departure for in very sooth he was a &quot;Wearisome Guest&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course winter in this land <s>to</s> was to us an unusual &amp; interesting <s>business</s> experience &amp; though we all anticipated that the cold would cause as many casualties as bullets, we were agreeably surprised to find that after the first few days in the trenches when those specially susceptible to cold went out quickly, the others have stood it remarkably well, some even waxing fat. <s>on t</s>&nbsp; Perhaps the worst <s>f</s> feature of winter in France</p>
