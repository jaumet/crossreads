 Dear Justice Ferguson Many thanks for parcel which I rec on Xmas Day The Cigaretts were Glorious. 
 We spent Xmas in a little Village called " Pry " near " Charlerio " it was very lonesome but still we don't mind as there is no more Trenches & no more Bombs Dropping on us at nights & no more Bombardments to go Through we are all anxious to get back now
