Jan. 6th 1918 Time 1-30 P.M. I am snug beneath the blankets in my bivvy. As it happens, there is nowhere else to go; and it is about the only place where one can keep warm, for outside it is pouring rain, with a driving, bitter wind that chills to the very marrow. Last night my "bivvy" mate and I had a very unpleasant experience. Quite early into the evening, after a couple of hours comparative calm, there rose with renewed force, a howling devil of a wind that lashed the sand (which had been surface dried by the earlier wind of the day) into swirling clouds, that looked like a fine mist, but which had a very different effect on the sense of touch. It cut and stung the face like a sharp slate.
As we lay in bunk that night, with everything snug we could hear the drift of it; and it was blown over the bivvy from the windward side, and slithered down the other in a never-ceasing stream. We did not pay a great deal of attention to it at the time
