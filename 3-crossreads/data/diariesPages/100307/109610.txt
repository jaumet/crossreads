was there with the D.A.D.O.S. and some of their figures regarding stores were particularly illuminating. After they had done the General came in and we had a discussion on our attack of a few days since over some afternoon tea. Our argument lasted until 6 so I phoned to Spiller to carry on with the mess. Pedler walked back with us we found that Major Parkes Dr Campbell Smith had already dined and all hands were on the way to the concert which had been well organised by Capt Alderson. Every item was excellent ? the voices were good and there were no duds. A large audience ? the men all fresh and smiling and looking fit. Their minds well off the War. Stewart returned from leave today and he brought me my new tunic. Ella sent a splendid parcel of chocolate from Paris. Fierce arguments re the War ? all consider USA entrance must shake the Hun up
