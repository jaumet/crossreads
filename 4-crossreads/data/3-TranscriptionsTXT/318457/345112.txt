[Monday 14 - 17th September 1914]
About 6.30 Monday 14th Sept firing was heard some distance off. We slipped cable and proceeded from our station at the harbour entrance as guardship, to assist. It proved to be the "Encounter" shelling the ridges above Herbertshohe to which the enemy had advanced yesterday. The shelling was intended to scare them away while more troops were landed.
The fire was directed to an area of 11/2 miles square over the ridges, this being searched by the guns with lyddite. Some 48 shells were fired up to about 7.30am.
At 9pm Monday 14th Sept we sailed for Sydney. The Flag had left during the afternoon and was to search a bay on the south. She was about 70 miles ahead. We were doing about 121/2 knots. Sea was smooth on Tues and Wed. but the roll was increasing as we went south.
Smoke was reported on the horizon to the south on Tues and we signalled the Flag "ship appears to be shadowing us to the south". However we neither saw nor heard any more of this source of apprehension.
The Flag's high power wireless broke down on Thurs. so she came on our beam and transmitted all signals manually for us to send on by wireless.
