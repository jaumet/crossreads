<p>Pat &amp; I at Anzac. Gee Whizz!! but the flies do trouble one, when you have been through the ceremony of the tonsor. Dont I look a queer citizen. All the same I found it nice in the warm weather. When we haf the cold 'snap" I had to sleep with a regular sort of turban to keep my top story warm.</p>
<p>The photograph is unfortunately under exposed.<br/>Looking at this again later, I would say fortunately.</p>
<p>Just came across this photo, which I previously intended sending home. I decided later not to, do so as it might hinder recruiting.</p>
