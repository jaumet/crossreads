<p>SATURDAY, JUNE 7, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine, with a misty scud in afternoon.</p>
<p>down at the Middle Bore again. The</p>
<p>whole pipe slipped &amp; we had to</p>
<p>get the winch to pull it up</p>
<p>again. Got it going but it broke</p>
<p>the rod. Let 100 acres of Wheelers</p>
<p>clearing to MacInnes at 5/- per acre.</p>
<p>Swapped creamy colt to</p>
<p>R. Welch for a bay mare.</p>
