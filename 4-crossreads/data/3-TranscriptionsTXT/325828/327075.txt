 No. 29 Training Squadron, A.F.C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 24.12.17. Shawbury, Shropshire 5-11-1917. 
 My dearest Father, My last letter home was written about 10 days ago from Mr. Hammonds home, London, where I was staying for 6 days leave.  At the time I wrote to you, I  en  posted under insured postage a souvenir walking stick made out of the parts of 6 aeroplane propellors, also separately the original fragment of Zepp, the first to be brought down in England during September 1916. Just a few days after posting I received one from you enclosed in one to Mr. Hammond, &amp; the following day one that had been re-directed from London H Qrs Address, with the duplicate warrant for &pound;30. At the same time I received a notification from the Bank of N.S.W London stating that they had rec'd this amount &amp; that it was at my disposal. However it is down in London, &amp; there it will stop.  I don't intend to draw on it at all as I find my 3/6 per diem net rate ample for what I require. I am getting on O.K. here, but what is the main thing I am keeping fit.  The weather is bitterly cold but we have a tremendous lot to be thankful for.  A fine camp, with asphalted paths
