<p>entirely at ease regarding it.  I have now grasped all details &amp; carry on independently.</p>
<p>The situation is unchanged.  The usual artillery retaliation rounds take place during the day &amp; night, &amp; outside the danger of snipers bullets &amp; the noise of a night demonstration there is nothing to disturb the peaceful serenity of our surroundings.  Peaceful! peaceful as far as the native will have it &ndash; indeed if <strike>one</strike> a stranger to the war suddenly happen here when early morn breaks forth in all its glorious radiance over land &amp; sea, he would never credit if you told him that grim death lurked in every valley &amp; on every hill.</p>
<p>Saturday 9th Oct 1915</p>
<p>Mirabile ductu.</p>
<p>It rained &amp; blew hell last night &ndash; a most uncomfortable "preliminary counter" to what we are to experience in a few weeks.</p>
<p>As soon as twilight faded away into night, a dense storm wrack <strike>appeared</strike> enveloped us with whirlwind intensity as if <strike>to</strike> its sole mission was to tear the very vitals from our <strike>bivouac</strike> shelters.  The black canopy of clouds, wh had lain dormant &amp; high throughout the day, now descended <strike>upon the ear</strike> &amp; plunged us into a inky darkness through wh one found it impossible even to grope.  Rain poured in torrents as if the gates of Niagara had been let loose, &amp; soon converted the dusty terraces &amp; pathways into quagmires from which our boots could hardly be withdrawn.  The wind howled &amp; shrieked like so many aerial devils &amp; many a primitive dug-out was mangled &amp; torn to shreds.</p>
<p>I was in the office when the storm broke &amp; I <strike>have a</strike> shall always retain a very vivid memory of my struggle in the inky blackness to reach my <strike>bivouac</strike> dug-out.  The storm did not materially affect it however, though I spent an hour hanging on like grim death to the tarpaulin roof which was swelling ominously with each gust of wind.  Early morn saw the disturbance spent of its fury.</p>
