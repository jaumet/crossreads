<p>Div. Rest Station. The Hospice belongs to some Belgian Religious Order and the Nuns &amp; orphans are still occupying a portion of the buildings. Locre is a small village with the usual big church &amp; is situated in the Messines sector. The guns are roaring day &amp; night but several miles away &ndash; too far off to worry us. We seem better off here as regards the "taube-pest" than at the Farm where there were plenty of dumps, camps &amp; light &amp; broad gauge railways.</p>
<p>The British are employing big gangs of Chinese labourers as working parties on railway sidings etc. They are a fine stamp of "chow" but would be no good in the line. When Fritz machines are over us dropping bombs measures have to be taken to prevent the Chinese bolting. Their tents are usually surrounded by tall, bard-wire fences.</p>
