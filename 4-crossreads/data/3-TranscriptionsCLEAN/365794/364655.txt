 Tuesday 10th [September] '18 Went Cairo with S. Nicol, Groppis met Mr. Maurice who paid for 4 p.m. mango ices & lemonade, then hair massaged (5th occasion) bought bread (Pt. 21/2) & home in a car with Sister & Lt. Mc ? her friend. Already the evenings are dark at 7 p.m. & at 5 a.m. darkness reigns.  Hosp. being increased to 1600 beds (now 1000).  All pts. cleared out if up the line hosp. is passed on to us. Still the sisters get ill, S. Walker off with dysentery, S. Rayson going home on next boat.  Only 2 days leave allowed me hosp. short-staffed.  Dysentry coming in freely. Troops in 31st have violent diarrhea all night, food bad?  Bread is again black & I cannot face it.  Buy my own or pts. bring for me.
