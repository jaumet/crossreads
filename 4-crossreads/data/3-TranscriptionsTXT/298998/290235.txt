 food and clothing; but these poor unfortunates bear their misery and torture, silently gallantly and nobly. I detest sitting down to a meal in the presence of these dejected men; but what can one do. Nothing! beyond giving a little occasionally. I am glad to say most Englishmen do the same. In my Barrack there are two Russian Sergeant-majors, one of whom speaks excellent English, and is a well-bred and educated man. It is pitiful to see his haggard face and starved body, bearing the marks of long years of suffering in Hun hands.

The English provided a concert last night, which I enjoyed immensely. 
 2nd &ndash; 10th. Awfully fed up and bored. I am keenly anticipating repatriation, but I must wait patiently. A case occurred today that really deserves mention. Two men, one of my own battalion
