 Dear Mum, 
 This is the junction where trains branch off to go to Port Said. You will notice how these horses are all shot in a heap. All villages are the same & the smell, ugh! it is frightful. These places are all on the skew & one side lower than the other, like Dad's fowl houses before he got his glasses. Some are a foot out of the square yet they seem to hold together. I do hope that you will not be sick anymore. Hoping to Home again at X'mas  & Remain Your's always Harry Make Dad try bee stings for Rheumatism
