132Father and Geoff went to Harry"s funeral on Monday 19 June.  A letter from Father last night read me this.
As far as it was possible for me to love anyone I loved Harry - his bookishness and his character.  More he knew of me myself than any one else, and he was the only chap I"d have liked going through this lazy record with.
And the last and only letter I"ve had from him, received while at Ghezireh, is typewritten.
Who else is there:  Const. Vin and Gerald.  Vin at the lines above, Gerald drawing 2.10.- a week and not worrying on the war, and Const. still working, but not fit for service.
I cannot realise that Harry is dead, else I should feel it more deeply than I do.
133  Aug. 15After we"d been working without talking for about an hour yesterday morning, Alek looks out:  "For God"s sake wish us many happy returns Frank, - It"s my birthday, and not a soul knows"!
We had tea in Wimereax at the jolly little Cafe - a broken omelette - we watched it being made - almost made it in fact as we have at the same place made them on cream:  with it we had hot rolls, Cafe au lait and jam:  it was delicious, a Rhemy Brandy, then a walk along the beach and then back to Wimereax for some Champagne - back to camp and then we drank his health.
134Yesterday received from controller M.O. Dept. London notification that the order had been forwarded to Camp for a new one payable at Boulogne.  Have to call at Cox"s now in Boulogne re last for 2.
Today I returned to Jonas Wilde"s "Intentions" he lent me during the first march of Mosset.
135The remnants of a library - Poe"s Poems, Keats and Browning, Macbeth, Antony & Cleopatra, Moonbeams from the Larger Lunacy, Aspects of the Irish Question, Times book catalogue, Apollo, Made in England, and Bernard Plumes, Poems G.K.C., Beerbohm"s works.  Merriden have had on order now about a fortnight, Verhaeren"s Plays, The Yellow Book, Vol. 1, The Holy War - verse of Katherine Tynan and when published McGill"s Soldier Songs.  Also several collections of cartoons - which will have to wait till I get some spare cash.
136Last night I got a letter from The Times Book Club notifying me they had put me aside a copy of the de luxe edition of Raemaeker.  When we get leave to England I must call on them and enquire as to price of binding etc. and as to shipping rates.  I"d like to get that 20F. collection of cartoons.  "Le Guerre des Artist" I saw in Marseille and have it bound in buckram - the present paper covers are too light for its size.
137  Aug. 16I am becoming more and more like Tommy every day:  'things" more often than not are far more interesting and pleasurable than people.  What sympathy for instance approaches that of a well designed lounge chair, large, roomy and cool, and a well written, well bound essay, verse & more, and a portfolio of etchings and drawings, of State Express 999 Cigarettes and - nothing else.  I read "Quinneys" while in camp in Liverpool over 12 months ago:  next order to Merriden will include the stage version.
