<p>5th Aust M.G. Coy,<br/>Somewhere in  France,<br/>4th December 1916.</p>
<p>My dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Richards,</p>
<p>As a close friend of your dear son Roy, I feel that I cannot let this opportunity pass to ask you to accept my deepest sympathy in your sad bereavement.  I myself was wounded in the right thigh by the same shell that caused dear old Roy's death, and I was with him till our arrival at Rouen Hospital.  There we parted, going to different Hospitals, and at the time were laughing and joking about a trip to Blighty.  Imagine therefore, the shock I received when our genial friend Harry Smith, told me he had passed away at Bristol.  Even now I can hardly realise that my beloved and true friend is no more, as he was so bright when I last saw him.</p>
<p>It will no doubt be a great consolation to you to know that the brave lad was among good friends when he died, and that the funeral arrangements were of a most impressive character.</p>
<p>Believe me the loss of such a staunch and true pal as was dear old Roy to me, is a very hard one, and I think his bright face and cheerful disposition will always be green in my memory.</p>
<p>Again asking you to accept my heartfelt sympathy,</p>
<p>I am,<br/>Yours in all sincerity,<br/>(Sgd) Jack F. Leech</p>
