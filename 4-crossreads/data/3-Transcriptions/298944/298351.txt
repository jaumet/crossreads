<p>Sunday 10 Aug 1918<br/>Marched out of L'Etoile, near where we detrained, &amp; in which we spent a very comfortable day, to a point along the road where the infantry of our brigade were ahead already resting by the road side. After about an hour's wait a pack of motor char-a-bancs arrived, &amp; the whole collection of us boarded them. By now news had arrived of the commencement by our boys, the Canadians, Tommies</p>
