<p>&amp; had a lovely drive along the banks of the Nile R. Oh, it was a beautiful sight I'm just longing to see it by daylight today. We have not had many wounded in, just lately, mostly from heat exhaustion. It is fearfully hot &amp; the poor fellows feel it very much, the dust &amp; heat is too much for them. We expect more poor wounded in the morrow. Our brave men have had a bad time again. I hope to write more next mail. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. Love to all my friends. I'm very well &amp; happy in my work. It costs us nearly  &pound;  1.00 a week for mess. So I shall not be able to save any money. Glad the Sydney Ice gave a Div., hope Bill will be able to settle my debts alright. Must get ready now. Good-bye lots of kisses &amp; love. From Edith</p>
