25th November '16
Early morning Stables. Cleaning up for inspection. Left by car at 2.30 for Salisbury. Arrived after a fine ride at 3. Walked about town bought sundry things. Booked seats at New Theatre. Had tea at Nicholas. Kept the show going, the boys kicking up some row. After tea walked down to the County, had our first drink. After this had sundry drinks round town. Arrived at theatre with the boys very merry. A general mixup. Some of the boys rushing about to get rid of some surplus beer. Anyhow we did not see much of the show. Left theatre at 10.40 to get car. Got car back at 11.15 with boys a bit better. A very fast ride home and the night air which was very cold cleared them a bit. Got to bed tired. Received letters from Nance Beattie.
