17th August to 5th September 1917 At Harborne Hall getting on the road to fitness again. Had a good time here, and was sorry to leave.
5th September 1917Transferred to Dartford Hospital in Kent. 17 miles from London. Pretty rough after Harborne.
14th September 1917Left Dartford for Weymouth Con. Depot.
24th September 1917Left Weymouth this morning for Park House Salisbury Plain as a case for Australia. Hope to be on a boat very soon unless I come the proverbial "Girtzer"
29th September 1917Still on this famous Plain. Have come this "Girtzer" in as much as my medical papers are missing, and so far see myself being left behind with a few others here. I hope anyhow to be lucky enough for them to turn up before the boat sails.
1st October 1917Papers turned up today. May have the luck to be with the boys after all.
2nd October 1917Name came out on the boat roll today.
