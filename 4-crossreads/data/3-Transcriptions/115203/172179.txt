<p>Popes Post, a fairly quiet trench until&nbsp;such time as our reinforcments arrived from Egypt, I got a job on the trench Mortar Gun my new chum and myself made a snug little posse for our Gun or what we thought was&nbsp;a safe posse but two day&nbsp;later a 6 inch Howitzer took the roof off but forgot us and the Gun, I forgot to mention that I&nbsp;got hit on the saturday nights affair with a piece of shrapnel on the temple just over the R eye I&nbsp;will bear the mark for many a day although it is of not great dimensions, I&nbsp;went to the base hospital for a while and came out quite fit, I&nbsp;did not care to mention it before as I&nbsp;thought you might think it more serious than it really was, we are still up at popes dont get much sleep here as the officers who do the observing at night come and rouse you up if they see the slightest movement in the Turkish lines and we have to put over some 100&amp; 12 Bombs then get back into our blankets&nbsp;only to be up again in a few minutes one never gets what you could call a&nbsp;</p>
