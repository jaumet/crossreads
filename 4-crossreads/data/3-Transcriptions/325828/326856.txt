<p>[3]   I went down to see Walter to-night, &amp; found him tired after a heavy day's work.<br/>Perhaps this disappointment is for the best after all, for to-night with 1 or 2 others I put my name in for reinforcements of A.M.C men.  They are picking 72 men on Thursday for reinforcements of General Hospital, Field Hospital &amp; Field Ambulance.  I put my name in for the latter.  They want men who have been in camp, infantry included <u>before</u> the 30th <u>June</u> only, &amp; especially those who have had any experience with horses (as drivers I suppose)   We came into Camp on 21st June &amp; I think myself, I stand a good chance of being picked on Thursday, as they want 72, &amp; so far only 58 have offered.  Should <strike>we</strike> I be picked, we we probably be leaving direct on the 15th inst. cutting out Queen's Park altogether.<br/>We are very busy at the camp now, 9 wards nearly all full 8 of which are measles, the remaining ward being pneumonia cases.  We have had 4 deaths here since Friday night- including one here last night.  This poor chap was only 18 &frac12; years of age, &amp; had only been</p>
