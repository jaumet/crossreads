  
 with our full packs on (after being sneaked down by a way that "Jacko" couldn't spot us) so as to give the impression of fresh troops coming on the Peninsular. Now we all have to have "tails" hanging down our back so as the fellow behind can take hold as we leave in a single file & there will be no chance of anyone losing touch with the one in front  & so leading all behind him astray. Equipment is tied so as not to rattle & bagging is wrapped around our boots. We have withdrawn from firing line this evening (left a few of the old hands behind to fire intermittently) & are lying down on Gun Road awaiting orders to move. 
 "Abdul" knows nothing - I wonder if we will embark tonight. 
 Lemnos  Sunday Dec 19th 1915. Got away from ANZAC in the early hours of this morning without a hitch & are going to stay ashore here for a few days. Everyone is thankful for a rest but it gave us a pang to leave our dead here. Marched up to Sarpai Camp today & put up in tents. Our rearguard left behind in firing line rejoined us here. 
 Christmas Eve 1915. Had our Xmas Billies at the Sarpai Camp & received a pay  1.10.0 from LT. Matthews.
