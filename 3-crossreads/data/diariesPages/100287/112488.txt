15th of December
Today being Sunday the usual services were held. The old parson dwelt strongly on bad language a few of the worst words in particular which he urged all to cut out before landing in Australia he is quite right , there was also a lecture on the Queensland Repatriation scheme I intended to hear this but was so interested in "Nicholas Nickelby" too comfortably perched up "forrard" on big coils of rope that I totally forgot the whole thing, it has been a beautiful day but a little on the cool side.
This evening a few of our lads went down below to give the engines a go to such good purpose did they work that in 2 hours the old ship covered 30 miles a record
