<p>[Saturday 15 April 1916]</p>
<p>Returned  Minia ordered a steak, Green Peas, Chip Potatoes &amp; Tea at Restaurant-(YAK steak) Another name for the Water Buffaloe or local cow   Owner said You Australians always order the same so housewives can note!!!<br/>(Dr Arnold has married a Nurse out here don't know her.  I told you Ralph has a Commission.) omit<br/> I s'pose a man will be able to earn some daily bread when this is all over, all I want is clean shirts, clean linen, plenty of flowers &amp; no flies, that's how I feel tonight; as I'm back under Canvas, &amp; the dust is very bad, whenever the horses go to water, it fills the ears, eyes, nostrils, tucker blankets &amp; everything.  Still better than Blizzards</p>
