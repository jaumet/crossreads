O how the Spring of love resemblethThe uncertain glory of an April dayWhich now shows all the glory of the SunAnd by and by a cloud takes all away
O Say not woman's false as fairThat like the bee she rangesStill sucking flowers more sweet & rareAs fickle fancy changesAh No The love that first can warmWill leave her bosom neverNo second passion ere can charmShe loves - and loves for ever
If she be not fair for meWhat care I how fair she be
