<p>P.S.<br/>Mother would you find out "Fat" Penfold's address &amp; send it to me. There is no saying where we shall get to later on &amp; if we go to England I would like to go and see him. Also any other people's addresses you know of. How about the Hendersons &amp; Frasers?. Do you know their addresses? There is no need to give me Sir George Reids'. I am sure to be able to find him, &amp; of course will go and have a yarn with him. Good-bye &amp; I will write again soon. I daresay we will have landed long before you get this &ndash; I hope so anyhow.</p>
<p>Love to all,<br/>Alan.</p>
