  
 consisting of 40 odd open trucks of all descriptions, into which 40 men were lined up, also had a truck of prisoners, we sat in trucks in the boiling sun to say nothing of flies till 11 am, then found out we were going to Telekebar.  We passed a place called Abu Zabul, where there is a very important Wireless station, also nearby is a Quarry, where there are hundreds of unfortunate Gypos & Arabs working in chains - this seems to be the principal Gaol. I lost my Cap in transit - Arrived at Telekebar about 2 pm - got some cheese - Beef & Bread at 5 pm - some Tea an hour later as the water is bad - This Camp is a huge one - were allotted to Tents - met a lot of lads I knew - We are nearly all sick & depressed, put it down to effects of Inoculation & of course were glad to try & get to sleep.
