Australian mail arrived again so feel pleased accordingly.<br/>July 4th Wednesday<br/>   The sports came off today in dull weather &amp; proved a great success.  The men engaged were awfully keen the spirit of competition shewn being the best recommendation possible for the spirit &amp; morale of the troops.  The drill was excellent &amp; worthy of the Guards although very little time was given to prepare for it.  A party of 150 men of the brigade gave an exhibition of physical drill under an English instructor &amp; it was one of the finest exhibitions possible.  Our Ambulance did not win chiefly through lack of interest.  The wagon was faulty the work being left to a couple of men &amp; no brassards were provided for the men.  The drill was very even, we lost on the wagon &amp; also the tent altho' the Judges decision on the latter was open to dispute.</p>
