 4 Monday Things are very quiet during the morning  The Canadians are bringing all their dead out of the front line &amp; burying them in a cemetery close to Hqrs.  Went up to posy on the right for about &frac34; of an hour to relieve our fellows for dinner, Fritz put a terrible lot of whiz-bangs over &amp; very close to our dug out, we were nearly buried once.  Relieved by the Canadians about 3 pm.  Freddy Ryan George Wirth &amp; myself put in the night by a mistake in Albert, we billeted with the 13th Field. 
 5 Tuesday Fritz put a few shells on Albert during the morning doing damage.  Killing one, wounded one, &amp; injured 2 horses.  About 10 am we came on to Warloy by motor sent out to get us.  We found that our Amb had left, we picked them up about 5 mls out of Warloy, we then marched to Rubempre where we billeted for the night.  Very dull weather &amp; the roads are very muddy.  Went for a walk up round the town in the evening.  Paid &pound; 1-8-8 in the afternoon. 
 6 Wednesday The 4th Field Amb.  had casualties, only  had 1sergeant killed &about; 4 wounded, one man went off sick, the 13th had 2 killed &amp; about 7 wounded,  the 12th  our section had no casualties at all.  Fell in 8.45 am &amp; marched out about 9.15 am.  I was detailed off on one of the wheelers.  It is pretty heavy work pushing them along.  We passed through Val de Maison &amp; Candas, arrived at Longvillette about 3 pm very tired, I suppose we marched about 10 miles.  We are billited in an old barn &amp; by jove it is a very lousy place too, but nothing compared to the trenches.
