Tuesday 27 AugustAt Morcourt sur Somme where we are to rest for a few days just behind the new balloon line. We came out last night & everything is very quiet.  Our Division's advance is highly mentioned in the papers & also is the 15" gun I saw yesterday. I expect we will be in again in a week.
Wednesday 28 AugustWet to-day but find time to go for a walk round the hills overlooking the Somme & villages of Cerises & Chipilly.  Our line here has been advanced again & is the right flank of the 50 mile attack to the North. Aquatic sports to-morrow.
