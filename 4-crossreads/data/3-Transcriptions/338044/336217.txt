<p>A good dinner at Rob Roy Hotel, &amp; a shave, &amp; we meet a lady whose son has a commission in the artillery. She has been in Australia    &amp; very pleased to meet us   After a chat in her house we get the 9.15 pm train to Dublin &ndash; an all night journey</p>
<p>30th July:- Sunday<br/>Arrive at Kingsbridge station Dublin, 4.30 am, tired &amp; cold &amp; not a person in sight. Off we march per foot &amp; Legge takes the lead. As I am in no humour for walking &amp; neither is Palliser (Chant has gone on to Belfast), we lag along. Bridges &amp; bridges we pass by the Liffey &amp; never seem to sight O'Connell Bridge, our objective &amp; I'll not forget that tramp  Pal &amp; I were inclined to throw in the sponge which we do at Sackville St. Talk about a picture, I sat on the ledge &amp; sulked with Palliser. Old Legge marches steadily on to Westland Row Station  Luckily a jaunting cart bails along &amp; very happy I finish the journey "&agrave; la voiture"    &amp; beat Legge on the post. More lounging about on the station until 7 am    &amp; I suggest breakfast. At the Hotel Grosvenor opposite we manage a good<strike>breakfast</strike> wash &amp; brush &amp; feel a little better.
