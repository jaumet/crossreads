<p>to pay out over 80 francs for dinners etc in the mess so am rather stumped and will have to go steady for sometime.   Paid my billet bill today which further reduced my purse, paying &frac12; franc per night, a good bed &amp; hot water in the morning.   Military rate for a Sgt is 2 per night but when we look out for ourselves we have to pay more.</p>
<p>Saturday 19th Jan<br/>    Had a poor day &amp; finished up with an awful headache through biliousness.    Very little to do.</p>
<p>Sunday 20th Jan<br/>    After the parade three of us, W.O. Sutton, Sgt Campbell, &amp; myself set off for a days outing.   We left about 11.30 &amp; walked to Etaples a distance of 6 miles.   There are large camps in this area, mostly New Zealanders &amp; Canadians, the Australian having been shifted to Havre.   The town itself very poor, not much better than a village but it possesses a tram which runs onto Paris Plages, a fine watering place on the Coast.   We had lunch in Etaples &amp; then took a cab &amp; had a rollicking drive</p>
