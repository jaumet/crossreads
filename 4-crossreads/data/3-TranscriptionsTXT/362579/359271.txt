 Glad when dinner time comes to see the others. Our M.O's are wandering about trying to get into mischief. They may move on to-morrow then we shall have to go b ack to the 29th Mess. It will be very different to our own but maybe only for a short time. All our tents are down   &amp;  a number of the buildings &ndash; We are leaving six large huts (Wards) for 29th C.C.S.   &amp;  we are to help them until further orders. 
 We had great fun Toboggan yesterday probably our last time. We shall miss the fun very much. The snow is very hard, real ice   &amp;  getting less, so unless another fall of snow comes soon, no chance to continue it. 
 Dorothy is still on Night-duty. Had a bust time in 29th C.C.S. last night. Sorry she had her leave, we could have had it together if not.
