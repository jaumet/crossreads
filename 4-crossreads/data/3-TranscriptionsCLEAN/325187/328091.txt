  Today the Infantry are practising their attack on El Arish  Aeroplanes dropping Smoke balls & spotting for the guns   Enemy bombed 2 L H   I rode over & had Tea there they showed me a 20 lb bomb that had not exploded [illustration ] Vane, Powder Cap - (Smaller than the Romani ones) than most   Later  4 of these were dropped on our Brig but did no damage- I watched with my glasses & altho' the sound is very clear the bomb is not seen till it bursts- before this happens the horses & men have scattered.
