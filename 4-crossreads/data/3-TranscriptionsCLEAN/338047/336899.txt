We were not doing much work at this time, and the boys were wandering around a good bit. There was a bottle factory near Neste that was worth going through, but my leg was too sore to enable me to walk there. I took one walk as far as Neslette (I think with the idea of stealing some fruit, I forget now). we had to obtain water every morning for the cooks. Our well at the Chateau was practically empty and we were using the well at the empty house next to the barn. One morning Monsieur from up the road stopped us getting it. His wife and daughter were also there, and soon the air was thick with French and gesticulating hands. At last he said that he would "partie from son fusee", and he promptly departed for it. We also departed for our bayonets, and having got them, paraded ostentatiously up and down the road flourishing them. Monsieur forgot to return.
