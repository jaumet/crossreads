 1916 &nbsp; SATURDAY 16 &nbsp; SEPT. 
 Fine. Out with the range takers ect in morning &amp; got away at 12 pm with Warren in a car. But the thing broke down half way to Salisbury &amp; we had to get another car. Got up to London about 4 pm and picked up Alan &amp; Ike Moses &amp; John Wilkinson &amp; a lot more. Went to see &quot;Romance&quot; at the Lyric but it was a real good thing spoilt. We had supper somewhere afterwards &amp; got to bed.
