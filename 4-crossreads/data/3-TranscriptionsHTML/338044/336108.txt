<p>3rd Nov:-<br/>Am feeling rather ill this morning &amp; was same during the night. Parade sick at 6 am when names are taken  &amp;  we Parade again at 8-15 am    &amp;  are marched to Dispensary, where after a good wait I get a dose of<br/>Bismuth &amp; no duties for the day. Slept after lunch until 5 pm &amp;  so missed having my medicine at 4-30. Arriving at Cairo rather later than usual I met a few friends &amp;  again went around the Arabic quarters, afterwards having a donkey ride. Imagine my surprise on dismounting to see a friend &ndash; an old Pal &ndash; Pelham de Mestre, who I thought to be still at the front. He returned with Malaria &amp; is now on duty at Intermediate Base, Cairo  Now visit his quarters, where we have some refreshments &amp;  I return home late</p>
