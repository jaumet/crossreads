<p>My dearest Irene,<br/>How goes  it dear old girl. I want you to do me a favour &ndash; a short time ago Harry Budden fixed up something for me in Cairo at the cost of &pound; 1-0-10. one pound &amp; ten pence. I could pay him back here, but we may be moved off at any time &amp; it would make me very short , so I arranged to pay it back in Sydney. Do you mind paying it in at the office of Kent, Budden &amp; Greenwell Pitt Street. you will be able to get the address from the Telephone Book. &amp; ask them for a receipt &amp; send it to me please, &amp; I will repay you at my earliest opportunity.<br/>I hope you wont mind doing this for me dear. With much love dear to you all.<br/>Your loving brother Fred</p>
