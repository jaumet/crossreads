<p>Tables as at present we have to go out to the lake behind the Huts to wash ourselves. Shortly there will be Hot &amp; Cold Water provided to Wash our Clothes &amp; Face &amp; hands &amp; then the Hot Baths will be fixed up so in a few Weeks everything will be A.1. the same as the staff was at Borre before the Evacuation took place last April, there must be between 800 to 1000 Men in this Camp &amp; later on all the Engines will be stabled down here, as at present it is necessary to have to proceed to St Omer for the Engines, but that wont be for long. I have be lucky to be off duty all yesterday &amp; up to Dinner time today Wednesday, so will report myself this Evening if not called on before, as it is necessary after being off duty 48 hours.  All day Thursday I was off duty, not being required until Friday 26th when I was notified at 6.30 am for duty at 8 am at St Omer, where I was told off with another Driver to work the Turntable, as every Engine before being stabled has to be run on the Table</p>
