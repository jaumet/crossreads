<p>16-5-1917<br/>Wet and wintry.  Very trying weather, Hot for a few day, and then a change, almost freeze you.  Very quiet today.  A little Artillery activity just now 7 p.m.  Visited the village of Bertincourt, about 1&frac12; miles from here.  We are midway between the above named place and Velue.  Terreble wreckage, not a complete house there.  With the exception of a dozen Tommies, the only living things there are a few cats.  In the centre of all these villages, are large ponds of water, where the villagers water their horses.  This particular one is marked poison.  There is a grave yard containing about 200 graves (Germans) and in the middle is an Englishman's grave, Pte. Davies, 10/3/17 inscribed on a wooden cross.  This was erected by the Huns.  This yard was in perfect order.</p>
