Was surprised at extent of Gardens & collections of animals & birds. There I heard the Egyptian Band. It struck me that the main object of life of most of the performers was to blow as hard as they could on the instruments. Had Tea at YMCA Gardens where praise must be given for the fine unselfish efforts of a few Ladies & Gentlemen in the interest of Soldiers. Evening we visited Kursall seeing the old comedy again Charley's Aunt Sunday Aug 5 Came to Town. Heard Welsh Concert Band in Ezmekiah Gardens.
