<p>Sunday, 10 January, 1915<br/>Church Parade as usual in a.m.  Bathing Parade to the prison in the afternoon rode our horses up.</p>
<p>Coming home we bought a pup for half a piastre (1 &frac14;) off some native children.  Sunday night went for a walk and got into another scrap, we climbed a wealthy Arab verandah to see a native concert &amp; got chased by a gaffir.</p>
<p>Our sports meeting is decided on &amp; will be held on Sat week.  There is a first class programme and we are all training our horses in friendly rivalry.  I am appointed on the committee to hold a concert at night.</p>
<p>Monday, 11 January, 1915<br/>Important news, the Div. Amm. Col. [Divisional Ammunition Column] left this morning for Mena.  Hear that the Turks are in close proximity and are very strong in Palestine.  It is rumoured that we will leave in about three weeks time.  Tonight at the recreation hut there was a splendid concert and lecture on The Desert with lantern slides.  I got a treble encore with my recitations.  There was a sad happening last midnight a man named McDowell of the D.A.C. was hit by a train at Maadi station and was terribly mutilated, he was brought to our hospital where he had both legs amputated, but the shock was too much &amp; the poor fellow died in fearful agony about 6 a.m.</p>
