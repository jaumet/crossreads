<p>One French Officer says "My word we heard you australians were wild but you can fight" and one English Major in the Artillery who was fetching his guns back said to our Officer he was very pleased the Australians were in front of his guns and he decided to get his guns into position instead of retiring so what better compliments could be paid to us. I believe one of the AIF Divisions has been decorated by the French Army so I suppose you will know all about it by now</p>
