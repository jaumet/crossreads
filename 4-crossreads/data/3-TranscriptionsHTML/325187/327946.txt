<p>Dates<br/><strike>Our Brigade is so depleted by sickness (We have been 9 weeks in the Desert) we could not muster up enough.</strike> We were due for a rest at the end of this month but now with enemy so active expect that will be postponed.<br/>Turks have timed their run to catch the date crop which is just ripening- they can live on lentils Dates &amp; Brackish water &amp; we cannot.  That is the difference.  Odd Turks are being captured daily by our Patrols   They are big strong men, but footsore &amp; not unwilling to be made prisoner, some of them at all events are happier.<br/>Enemy Taube over again.</p>
