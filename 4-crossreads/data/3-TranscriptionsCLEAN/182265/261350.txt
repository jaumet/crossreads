  
 to visit my mother's cousin in Durham or in Wales. Decided on Wales as it was cheaper. Left Paddington at 1 & had a quick trip to Bristol. Here waited about 1 1/2  hours for Swansea train. Visited the business part of the city, bought postcards & gloves. Taxied back to Station. 
 A very pleasant & interesting trip through Severn Tunnel, Newport & Cardiff & Coal towns to Swansea. 
 Motored out to Mumbles with a Mr. Finlayson, whom I had met in the train. Booked up at Langland Bay Hotel - a beautiful building near a fine beach. Rang up Dr. Lloyd-Jones of Glen-Cerrig, Mumbles. His daughter & wife answered the phone & gave me a most cordial invitation to come to their place as soon as possible ie early in the morning. 
  10th   Visited Glen Cerrig - most cordially received & made quite at home. Mrs. Lloyd Jones is my mother's Cousin or second cousin
