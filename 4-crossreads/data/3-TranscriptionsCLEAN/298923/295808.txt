22 May 1918 WednesdayHad a Bath & lunch with my old friend the Military Governor of Bethlehem.Then attended a Municipal Council meeting [indecipherable], Bedouins etc: in national dress, the President an old rogue & the Scribe with one eye, Books all "cooked," but very neatly ruled & covered with big seals- written in Arabic, commencing at back of book & like shorthand [indecipherable].  The trouble was Turkish money had been accepted by Municipality in  payment of Rates, Taxes after proclamation that Turks notes were not legal tender-  Village was swept & we sat in a circle of heavily upholstered chairs full of Fleas- A Gendarme in old Turkish Uniform kept order- Coffee & Cigarettes- all the time.
