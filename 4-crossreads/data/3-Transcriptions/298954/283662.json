<p>Sat 15th June (cont.)<br/>At the Franco-American concert in evening.   Our "stalls" party included the two Mcs, George, &amp; self.   Bob has a liver and grunted his refusal to come.   The audience was delightful - scarcely an Englishman there.   We aired our French &ndash; I deftly worked into the conversation sentences I had just looked up in "Connor's Phrase-Book".   The concert was an improvement of the English effort of a fortnight ago &ndash; or perhaps we are in a better mood.   The orchestra opened with a "Carmen" selection, a "Signorita" warbled, a "Mademoiselle" chansoned, two hopeless Yanks gave "Yaacka Hula" &amp; "Chinatown".    We had a midnight picnic on the beach later &ndash; the four of us consuming much ersatz-lemonade &amp; biscuits &amp; having a concert on our own.</p>
<p>Sun. 15th June<br/>A most pathetic mass this morning for the sister of Lieut. Tellier &ndash; the girl was killed during an air-raid on Brussels last week.   The poor devil completely broke up at the close of Mass.</p>
<p>At vespers and rosary again in evening with the two Macs.<br/>(I'm getting quite devout recently, n'est-ca pas?)</p>
