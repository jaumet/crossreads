20/4/18 ? Lavieville
After dressing set off and walked across country to Henencourt. Very pleasant going across clover and cultivated paddocks. There is a dressing station in the village and all the way along the centre of the road was a trickle of blood from someone's bad wounds. On the left hand side of the ruined street is an old church with a square tower. From inside its shattered walls came the sound of someone at the organ. The old Chateau dominates the village. It is built after the style of a miniature Versailles. Found Bde. H.Q. down in the cellars. In all the rooms
