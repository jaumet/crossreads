lose his leg. One of our men rather elderly died on a stretcher last night of plain heart failure. At 7 a.m. our artillery opened up in a practice barrage which was very effective and powerful. The retaliation was weak. The aircraft were vigorous. Major Margolin C.M.G. 16 Batt. and his O.C.Coys came up reconnoitring & will relieve us tonight here. They hop over in 3 days time - some troops 'the Anzacs'. Sent out Hunt & a few others in advance. Towards evening the aircraft started again and the enemie's flew very low all our L.G.'s and Vickers firing vigorously but without any success. At one time there were 55 machines in the air some coming down very low. It is amazing that we can't hit more by the bullet. One of ours crashed this morning near our "D" Coy and the pilot was killed. This evening one (Fritz's) came down on our left. Just about dark we put up a terrific barrage on the left and his retaliation was extremely heavy as he sent up S.O.S. calls by greens & reds.
