<p>cruisers, destroyers, submarines, merchant ships, &amp; even aeroplanes &amp; tanks. The scenery for the next 5 miles was really beautiful &amp; the further we steamed down the Lock-Lockgoilhead was a must glorious sight. Words cannot express the beauty &amp; grandeur of the scene. It resembles Middle Harbour in some places, only of course the hills on either side were more massive, in fact they were mountains, &amp; the peculiar blue colour of these mountains through the haze is indeed pleasant to look upon. Dunoon was passed about half way, another fine spot. (See post cards &amp; books). At Lockgoilhead we roamed about the sores for about an hour, returned to Glasgow at 7.30 P.M. This trip has been a most beautiful one, Lockgoilhead is one of the sights of the world. The far in the steamer was 7/6 return, including meals, &amp; I can assure you this was cheap. I spent the evening at the Theatre.   Stayed the night at the Grand Central Hotel. (Some swank.)   Next day Friday the 17th inst I took the train to Uddington, about five miles out of Glasgow to see Mrs McFadgen, her son is in A section, &amp; was anxious for me to call on her. It was a very pretty trip on top of the tram. Mrs McFadgen was a homely old soul I could scarcely understand her she spoke so</p>
