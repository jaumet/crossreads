CARTIGNY.
A poor old place all in ruins, only a few miles from the last place, but decidedly more &quot;healthy&quot;, although &quot;he&quot; does a good bit of &quot;business&quot; at night, but as there is only a small camp of huts here it does not make me so &quot;windy&quot;, although there are no cellars here.

We arrive at Cavillon the latter end of September.&nbsp; Nothing very exciting takes place, with the exception of &quot;his&quot; planes going over to drop a few &quot;eggs&quot; in Amiens and the large towns round about.&nbsp; Have a fairly good time here, not much to do and greater latitude is given to all ranks.
Strange rumours travel around that the end of the war is approaching and that the enemy are endeavouring to arrange an armistice.
The retreat of the enemy has been practically continuous since the
