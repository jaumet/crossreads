  
 Tuesday 18 February 1919 Divisional Field Officer again & also C.O. of Regiment as all the Senior Officers are away.  Busy disinfecting saddlery & Horse blankets, the former by dipping in Creosote, the latter by heat in the delouseing Boilers. The first thing I want done when we get to Bronte is to christen our Babe, her name is Registered in Cairo & Somerset House, London as Kathleen Dorothy but she has not been sprinkled with the Jordan water yet!!!
