  
 about 8 pm. The inhabitants were watching us from their houses & shops. I am convinced there are plenty of spies in Jerusalem. Passing through Jerusalem we took the Jericho road & arrived at Bethany about 10  pm. There we halted for a few hours. Tuesday Aug 20 Moved about 3 AM. It was pitch dark & cold. The division resumed its journey towards Jericho arriving at Telat El Doon[?] about 9 AM. We are staying here until tomorrow. Wednesday Aug 21 We left Telat EL Doon[?] at 5 AM.
