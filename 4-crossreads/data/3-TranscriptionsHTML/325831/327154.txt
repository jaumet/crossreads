<p>esting old city &amp; the beautiful cathedral. He dropped in to an adjoining Australian hospital &amp; discovered an old friend in young D'Arcy Irvine, who was subsequently very good to me. Tom's appearance in mud-covered uniform &amp; sheepskin vest, which stamped him out among the clean-uniformed men who crowd at a base, earned him a warm welcome at the Australian hospital. He was taken in &amp; given Hot Bath, clean fresh underclothing, new uniform, &amp; sheepskin vest, welcome changes after three weeks of Somme mud. We said good-bye in the hopes of meeting in England. After he had gone the Colonel of the Hospital (who had sent for him), my Doctor, the Sisters &amp; orderlies often asked me news of him.</p>
<p>The hospital resources of the empire appear to have been pooled. Very few Australian woundee find their way to the Australian Hospitals. It is just a matter of chance. Of course if they took only Australians they would be slack during quiet times &amp; hopelessly rushed after engagements like Pozieres. Certainly everything seems very well organised. I crossed in the Hospital Ship St Patrick&mdash;the tenth ship on which I have travelled since leaving Australia. Two of them, Franconia &amp; Allaunia, fallen to the submarines.</p>
<p>I must close now. Will write more often in future. Please remember me to Mr Bode &amp; all friends&mdash;will be writing to Judge Ferguson. I wish I could be of some help to Cousin&mdash;am looking forward to Tom's arrival for his sake &amp; her's. Fond love to yourself &amp; children.</p>
