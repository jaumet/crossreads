who were very musical, & a pleasant evening was spent.  Rise early the following morning & leave the Hotel at 8 a.m. by taxi to Gare-du-Nord, leaving by 9.10 a.m. Calais Express.   We were very downhearted having to bid Paris Good Bye - but, all good things come to an end. In fact we were exceptionally lucky, as on returning to the Unit, I found that Paris Leave had been cut out, & for an indefinite period. At Etaples to Boulogne we dined in the dining car, arriving at Calais at 5 p.m. We then had a good tea at a restaurant near station & leave at 6.40 p.m. train for  --------, arriving there at 9 p.m. Stopped at Hotel for the night, & left by lorry at 9 a.m. the following morning, arriving with our Unit again at 2 oclock in the afternoon. It was certainly a most interesting & enjoyable trip - I enjoyed every hour of it - but it was hard, returning to camp once again. However our hearts were gladdened by the news, that in a few days time, we will be leaving the Line, for a long rest, & some good times are in store for us. P.T.O.
