 We berthed a little after 3 p.m. and after long delays we disembarked about 9 p.m. Thus ended a most interesting and enjoyable voyage, one which provided me with, in one way, an unusual experience but shared by hundreds of thousands of troops whose experiences, I suppose are just the same as mine of which I have written as much.

The accommodation was good but of course one can expect nothing but a little crowding while being transported during a shortage in shipping. The life aboard was good. Naturally language was not always the best and the gambling of which I had heard great tales was not of so bad as one would have expected. It was only when the monotony for those who who were used to a lively life set in that the gambling set in and though much money changed hands  and it  the number who abstained from it was remarkable The worst feature of this was that a fair number of money belts began to be missing and it was not safe leave a belt about (a foolish thing to do at any time).

The Y.M.C.A. man did not appear suitable at all owing to a lack of experience, an individuality and vigor. This is regretable as the Y.M.C.A. is held in highest esteem by men of all sorts. The weather, well, was perfect. The roll of the Bight of course caused little inconvenience, the one days storm at the Cape was only to be expected and the remainder of the trip ideal.
