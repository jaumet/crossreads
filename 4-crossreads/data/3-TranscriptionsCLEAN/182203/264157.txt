Adelaide. Dear Madam. As I am desirous of obtaining my midwifery certificate, & have been advised to train in the above-named hospital, I should be obliged if you would forward me full particulars, re- applying as a trainee in your hospital. I trained & received my certificate at the Melb. Hospital about 6 years ago. I shall be pleased to forward copies of testimonials & certificates if necessary. Thanking you in anticipation,                                                                                                                                         I am, Madam,                                                                                                                                                                       Yours sincerely
