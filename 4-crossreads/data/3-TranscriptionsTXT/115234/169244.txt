Come listen to me & Ill
sing you a ditty
Of three little damsels
from London's fair City
To Codford they journeyed
air raids to escape
But rather I think
they came down on the make
___________ " __________
Do they want us to lose
the war
Grim landladies sniffed
when apartments they sought
No thanks not for mine Ive
had enough of your sort
So sadly the girlies
bought three tickets back bought
Do they want us to lose
the war
