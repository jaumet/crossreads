Still another day in bed. The chief excitement consisted of 2 heavy shells which landed within 20 yards of my tent tearing large craters and creating miniature earthquakes without hurting anyone. Stewart took the Battalion out to carry out a practice attack. Read and wrote and slept all day. Leo McCartin came back from England and is still mad to get into the Flying Corps so I must perforce recommend him. Our business like Staff Capt. The son of Sir John Lady - is a messer of the first water and bottles my recommendation for promotion. Different people came in for a yarn during the day and I went into Canteen and other matters Tomorrow reconnaissances for our move will have to be undertaken. Thewlis leaves for the Flying Corps to be attached for a few days experience
