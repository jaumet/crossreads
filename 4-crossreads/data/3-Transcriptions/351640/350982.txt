<p>5.9.15. Sunday. Good night my dears. God bless you.<br/>I cannot add more before sending the envelope to the post, but a post script may follow if there be aught of interest or of business that will relate to you or your affairs.</p>
<p>I have an appointment with General Ford at 10 a.m. tomorrow or rather to day, because the hands of the clock have reached beyond midnight.</p>
<p>Good night my dears. May the goddess Fortune keep deep in love with each of you, and may all that you desire be with you.</p>
<p>Good night. Good night. Good night.<br/>Heaps of love and loads of kisses for each of you.<br/>To all my friends my best wishes and kind regards.<br/>I am<br/>Your loving and affectionate father<br/>John B Nash</p>
<p>The Misses Nash<br/>2ic [219] Macquarie Street<br/>Sydney<br/>New South Wales.</p>
