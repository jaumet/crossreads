<p>1918<br/>June<br/>saw mills making a corduroy road through the bog and marsh on either side of the Ancre River. This is only a small river, about the size of the usual creek. The mosquitoes were very bad all the time we were working. An Engineer Sergeant, who was rather proud of himself, was put in charge of this job. After three days the signallers were given signal practice to do, but the rank and file carried on. The fatigue was supposed to finish at dinner time, but one day the Sgt told them that they would have to work till 4 pm. The boys immediately "went slow". Earth was being carted to fill up the road in the swamp and they did 20 loads during this hour. The Sgt then told them that when they had done 60 loads, they could go. The transport men whipped up their horses, and used to only half empty their limbers each trip with a consequence that the remaining 40 loads were finished in the next hour. The Sgt was surprised and thought there was a trick in it somewhere, but as he had counted the loads going past, and had omitted to see that the returning limbers were empty</p>
