<p>fresh meat when a boat arrive as it don't keep long here as for the hot weather. Of course we get pretty hot day here.<br/>Well we are posted out on a new place and it is tiptop.<br/>We posted at a large tunnel about 4 miles from Rabaul town and it right on the north of the Island. We camp on top of a hill and we get the fresh breeze from the sea. We have the two guards one at each end of the tunnel numbering 6 men and 1 n.o.c. and we do little bits now and then.<br/>We run into town every second or third morning for food.<br/>We have half an hour work in the morning and lie down for the rest of the day. About 2 o'clock we go for a swim in the beach and it is lovely. Sometimes it is like Coogee or Bondi and sometimes calm. Well we are living</p>
