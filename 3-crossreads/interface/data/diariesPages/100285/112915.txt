they took me up on top of a hill from where a good view could be had of the surrounding city with its millions of lights the enomorous Woolwich Arsenal lay right at our feet sparkling with its myriad lights like diamonds it was a lovely moonlight night that added to the attractions somewhat, the old lady was not so very surprised in one way to see me back, however the boy I slept in a great bed together I never woke till late in the morning I can tell you I was very pleased I went out there for they are a nice family I like the girls I don't think Len has made any mistake she's a cut above the ordinary girl so's her sisters I am off out there again next chance I get I hope it wont be so very long
