18/9/15 Slush lamps in vogue now ? a tobacco tin full of fat and a wick of flannel or rope ? stink awfully. A lovely moonlight night all hoping Abdul will come out. Revolver on and ten good cartridges in Lee Enfield rifle; rusty but sharp bayonet fixed ? dirty enough to set up blood poisoning in any wound it makes. Two papers tonight from Eveline home. Artillery say they put shell after shell into Turks trenches tonight bursting after entrance. German officers trench heavily garrisoned. From secret observation post at 2000 yds could see Turbaned Turk mules passing also others moving to fro in groups. All day night working at subterranean passages and shafts in bowels of hill. Amusing to watch the hot fire they were plugging into my dugout this afternoon during the demonstration ? evidently they regard it as a very special spot. The sniper will get me if he perseveres long enough. Abbott's wonderful dash from beach knocked him out had to make him rest and tear a few rums into him. Saw base of shell that knocked Derrick out 8" in diameter ? an awful thing fired by "Asiatic Annie" right over in Asia Minor at us in Europe. A quiet night, yarning and so to bed
