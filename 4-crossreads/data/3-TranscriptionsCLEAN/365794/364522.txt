Tuesday 30th April 191810.30 a.m. comes the Colonel, Sister McCulloch & a new M.O., Capt. Murphy.  I rise, Col. jerks out "getting out a little these last few days & that is better isn't it?", looks at chart, "quite satisfactory" & they all troop off leaving me in doubt as to my going tomorrow or not, however I never worry about that knowing it is useless in a military hosp.Put on my silk frock & enjoy a quiet evening in the grounds & talking a little to Miss McLean, nice woman.During afternoon I borrow from 2 "scarlet" boys in next room book on Patience - it is swung in on belt of dressing gown & all germs mingle freely.
