  
 (26) Leave in England 
 On March 1st 1918 four of us left the trenches for fourteen days leave to England.  We went to the Red Cross Dressing Station with our leave passes and were examined by the Dr and certified as being free from vermin and scabies.  Then marched to Romarin Camp.  Slept there that night with some New Zealanders in their tents.  We were up early next morning and marched to Steenwerck.  Had to wait all day here but in the afternoon got a troop train (which was literally packed) and travelled through a snowstorm till midnight, when we arrived at Calais. Marched to the great concentration camps there and reported ourselves.  We were given a tent and had a good night's rest.  Next morning we dumped our rifles and packs and were given our steamer passes to England.  But a terrific gale had been raging in the channel, lashing the sea and washing a lot of the stationary mines away from their moorings, which of course constituted a great danger to our shipping.  So we were delayed here three days while the mine sweepers (steamers) cleared the Channel of them.  In the meantime we had a good look over the fine old city of Calais, which at one time belonged to England, and we saw all the historic places associated with Joan of Arc &c. 
 On the morning of the third day we marched to the pier and boarded a steamer.  It was crowded with troops going on leave and we had a fine run across the Channel of two hours.  The great British warships were cruising about and Destroyers were flitting everywhere.  We travelled a "zig zag" course through a "lane" of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers.  Saw the "Queen Elizabeth" which at that time was the largest battleship in the world.  Arrived at Dover at 1 p.m. and took train to London, arriving there at 3 p.m.  Went to the Australian Army Headquarters where we were given a new suit of soldiers clothes, boots, hat &c., and after a shave, hot bath and good meal, booked our beds at the A.I.F. War Chest Club (where I always stayed when in London).  The A.I.F. War Chest Club was a large building in Westminster - near the Australian Headquarters - and was run by the English and Australian ladies in London for the Australian troops.  It had 500 in large dormotories and had every convenience, and good meals could be obtained cheaply by the troops - mostly food supplied by the Australian people. 
 We were very happy as we were away from the trenches and had fourteen days leave ahead of us and I myself had 25 in my pay book which had been cabled over from Australia by my Mother.  That night we went to the "Maid of the Mountains" in Daly's Theatre - seeing Jose Collins in the name part.  Coming home from the theatre an air raid on London took place.  We heard the anti aircraft guns booming and saw the people rushing about the darkened streets to the tube stations for shelter.  The church bells were ringing (signals for people to take shelter) and trains, 'buses and everything came to a standstill.  Police were patrolling the streets on bicycles with an electric placard on their back - "take cover". 
 We walked to the War Chest Club where we found a lot of the staff
