<p>October 1917<br/>to 3.</p>
<p>Saturday 6th<br/>More enemy planes came over at a great height &amp; were heavily fired at.  One unexploded shell fell fairly close.  Some thought it was a bomb coming down &amp; ran for a ditch.  Was having a bath at the time &amp; had to stand fast.  Brigade sports were held today.  There were some good events.  The band was playing &amp; General Allenby &amp; Genl Chaytor were both present.</p>
<p>Sunday 7th to Sunday 14th<br/>We have had an easy week.  The weather has got a good deal cooler &amp; several mornings have been very foggy.  The afternoons have been dusty.  Football has been continued with vigour  Several squadron matches &amp; 2 inter regimental matches, both of which were draws.  We had the pleasure of seeing a German aeroplane brought in.  It was brought down by one of ours over the Wadi &amp; the pilot was captured behind the lines.  Our air service has improved considerably.  There are some splendid aeroplanes here now &amp; they ought to shake Jacko up a bit.</p>
