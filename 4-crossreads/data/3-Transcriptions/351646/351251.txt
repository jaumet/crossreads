<p>"Parramatta<br/>Dear old Guy,<br/>I just got your letter of the 14th; I have already written you what little I can a yet find out about dear old Brian; the people who attended him I can&acute;t yet get hold of as they are Berrima people &amp; we cannot get ashore at all. No, I was not with him; if I only could have been! both the other destroyers had men with the party &#151; (sent up as reinforcements; the original party was far too weak as no resistance was expected apparently) -- but of course this damned outcast of a thing was sent to another place*<br/>I did not know that he had landed till we heard the result &amp; then there was some doubt of the names &amp; I had to wait two days before I could be certain; I never knew what such a thing could mean before. Everything is in our hands now as I expect you will know. And we are having a hell of a time in that all our energy is being spent in running in circles as far as I can see; it is a terrible situation Guy to see &amp; hear of the tremendous scraps going on &amp; know what pain and misery it means to those concerned in them &amp; and not be able to do your little bit towards taking the weight of it. Of course it is very hard to find their ships &amp; when we did manage to get some good information we were not allowed to use it till too late. I have written of this at more length but hold over the letters till there is less chance of their being opened as I fear they would be regarded, &amp; myself treated, as criminal if sent at present while war lasts.<br/>Our one stroke of luck was in capturing a prize the other day concealed in a little Island harbour. She was marvellously hidden covered with branches of trees etc. &amp; two other ships had searched the harbour before us &amp; failed to find her.<br/>She had several rifles and guns &amp;c &amp; one German in unloading a Mauser pistol after they had surrendered, was waving it about in a very dangerous manner so I thought I&acute;d better remove it from him. Unfortunately I was a wee bit slow &amp; my small finger slipped over the muzzle as it went off &amp; so I have a very sore left hand just now, &acute;tho the finger is still there. It was quite an accident on his part &amp; he is most apologetic about it &#151; drat him, it makes climbing up &amp; down ladders very awkward. Well old man I can&acute;t write but I&acute;d give a lot for an hour or two of your company. I&acute;m sick of everything just now as I&acute;m afraid we&acute;re just going to kick our heels together till everything is over. Give my love to Nell &amp; Johnny.<br/>Yours<br/>A.B.D.<br/>I hear you have to pay postage on these letters at the other end. God Bless our generous Government!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#148;</p>
