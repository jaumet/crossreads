<p>would not hold more than about 4000 men but it came in useful as a</p>
<p>temporary camp for troops en route for the North.&nbsp; Marseilles is</p>
<p>rather a fine city, spoilt by cobble streets and rattling old trams.</p>
<p>The view fro the surrounding hills is very fine especially at this</p>
<p>time of the year when the trees were blossoming and sprouting and</p>
<p>the wistaria and other brilliant climbers were at their best.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>Riviera is certainly a glorious climate if the few days we spent</p>
<p>there were a fair sample of the bulk.&nbsp; Women and old men seem to do</p>
<p>all the work hereabouts.&nbsp; The women drive the trams work on the</p>
<p>wharves ( and do quite as well as the Sydney wharfies at any rate)</p>
<p>in the Railway yards the Factories, the trawlers, in fact do any old</p>
<p>work previously done by the men.&nbsp; They do it so well that I should&#39;nt</p>

<p>France when this war has finished - that is if the Huns have not made</p>
<p>other arrangements for my future - for in addition to being good</p>
<p>bread-winners these French girls are not half bad to look at.&nbsp; About</p>
<p>every day or two in Marseilles a batch of German prisoners &quot;arrive</p>
<p>from the front&quot; and are marched through the streets much to the de-</p>
<p>light of the French folk.&nbsp; They are accommodated on a hulk in the</p>
<p>Harbour and from onservations I made I have a shrewd suspicion that</p>
<p>they were the same old Huns over and over again who were paraded</p>
<p>through the streets for their daily strafing by the good people of</p>
<p>Marseilles.&nbsp; It reminded me of say, a small tradesman in the suburbs</p>
<p>who owns two carts and numbers them 19 and 26.&nbsp; Nothing like making</p>
<p>an impression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our camp was visited in the early morning and evening by girls</p>
<p>and women sellling bread scones, cakes, etc. mostly I think of their</p>
