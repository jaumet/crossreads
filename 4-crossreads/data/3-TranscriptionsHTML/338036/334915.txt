<p>Thursday 14th<br/>SHORT REST</p>
<p>Preparations made for an early push off.  At 9.30 we set out for a place further back to rest for a few days.  After a most trying and arduous march with very heavy packs with exceedingly hot weather &amp; with us in the condition we were it was suicide.  We must have gone about 8 miles like this and arrived at a village behind Steenwerck &amp; Estaires called Doulieu &ndash; a very peaceful looking place.  The Hun had been here for a few days and burst the Church but otherwise untouched.  After a drink we were paid but were confined to our farm.</p>
