<p>Our trip across Gaza we saw our first sign of grass. On our way one saw the recently occupied positions of the Turks &amp; there were plenty of bombs left about for the unwary to be caught. A favourite method of Jacko is to leave a bomb in a heap of straw or among Horse feed . I turned my old Neddy out on the grass &amp; faithful fellow that he is, he was so hungry that he could not eat fast enough. We are all tired out &amp; simply lay on the ground and went fast asleep in a few minutes.<br/>Tuesday Nov 20<br/>Heard Division at  Ramleh. Moving up there tonight.</p>
