 My dearest Father, I must thank you for your letter dated 10th July that came to hand this afternoon.  This is the one that came by the "Sierra" via Frisco.  The other letter mentioned by has not turned up so far. I haven't seen anything of Wal or Rid since I last wrote, but yesterday I met Davies who is looking after Walter &amp; he told me W. was O.K. I am keeping well &amp; trust this finds you all in good health. Very wet &amp; muddy here again &amp; makes things very sloppy &amp; unpleasant Aust. mail closes tomorrow morning   Excuse short note but no news doing at present. Love to you all at home, Your loving son, Leo
