Friday Feb. 16. 1917I was up very late this morning.  There was another heavy frost last night.  In the morning I helped to bag up  a lot of coke & charcoal to go to the trenches.Before dinner I went to the Transports camp about 3 miles away in one of the limber waggons with driver Tom DevereauxI had dinner there.  In the afternoon I cleaned the wheels of two cookers and one water cart in readiness for painting with wood preserving oil which I will do tomorrow.  The hut I am camped in consists of a wood framework covered with black canvas.J. Mathews is in the same hut with me.
