<p>Friday 16th<br/>Had a very quiet night as there were some clouds about. Saw a horse taken past in a horse ambulance. Several Tanks passed this eavening. The first I have been close to while they were on the move. Odd looking affairs. There tracks are in all sort of odd places where we have been lately as they were used a lot in this advance. 4 more letters today (2 from Home</p>
<p>Saturday 17th<br/>A very quiet night. Quite cold this morning. Have given our packs in to be stored. It does not lighten my load very much as I find I need my blanket. Greatcoat &amp; waterproof most nights to keep warm. Was put on making a bank around our horse</p>
