  
 Tuesday 11 February 1919 Cold again but still see the men so it isn't too bad. Saw a basketball match between the Yank Officers & Con. Camp Officers. Yanks won easily (37 points to 10) Had a dance after & met some Yank Y.M. girls. They were good fun. 
 Wednesday 12 February 1919 Nice & warm. Went to a dance in the Con Camp & had a bonny time. Do me.
