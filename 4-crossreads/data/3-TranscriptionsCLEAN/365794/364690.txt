  
 Sunday 14 October 1917 Parotyphoid [paratyphoid] inj. 10.30 a.m., only one more & horrid business is over.  No church today & no music. I hear from the C.H. nurses Lee & Musgrave that they & the other nurses often put flowers on my sister's grave at the C.H.  Blessings on their heads for that. Today the ocean is like glass and not a "white horse" to be seen. We hope to be at our destination about 23rd inst. Funny how the "Ayrshire Blather" ship's weekly paper, shows up little episodes of daily life.  All Platonic friendships, etc., commented upon & S. Finn's Colombo affair with the "Chief" made into a parody on Excelsior & great is the annoyance thereat.  Petty affairs all of them but none the less real at the time.
