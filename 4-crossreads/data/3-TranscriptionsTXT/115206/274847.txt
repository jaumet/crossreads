October 1918.Friday 4
On right of Bellicourt, and rear of JohncourtWeather very moist. Wagon lines came up this morning. Issued with a new pair of boots. - bad pair, wrote to O.J. a letter that altho phrasing was severe, was essential. At 3.45 pm we went into action again behind and to the left of Johncourt. Dug a bivvie into the side of the railway bank. Evidently there is to be a stunt of some size around here shortly, in the morning perhaps .One of Fritzs barragers caught a team and waggon and did no end of damage. A great number of Scottish dead in this railway cutting.
