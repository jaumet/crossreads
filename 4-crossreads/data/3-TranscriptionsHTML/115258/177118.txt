<p>I did not want to cable for money as we were so near the end of the war and near to coming home, but now <s>it has arrived</s> you have sent the money I think I&#39;ll try to get to Luxor and Assuan, and to see what I can of Egypt before leaving, for good. The military allow you 4/- per day &#39;backseech&#39; whilst on sick leave and you have to sign a paper saying you wont eat any govt tucker during the 14 days you are away. I received another letter from Mother today. Seemed to be great excitement when Turkey and Austria chucked it in. I&#39;ll write again soon and tell you if I get this leave, but must catch this mail now. Love to Mother &amp; the boys. Hope you have got good rains ere this. In haste Your loving son Robert C Wilson</p>
