Tried a couple of cases at Orderly Room and awarded punishments. For the men tonight we tried to put on a few extras at dinner and got the cooks working a little overtime. Unfortunately we had difficulty in getting enough liquid refreshments and a motor lorry will probably arrive about an hour late. However always better late than never. Our printing press struck off Menus for the officers?dinner and a concert programme. The men's dinner tonight was a success and they all speak of being very well pleased with their turnout. The officers mess put on a good dinner. There were very few visitors and we had a few toasts only. "The Day we Celebrate" was proposed by myself supported by Dooley Kennedy and Gorman made a rousing speech on "Our Native Land". The Band played during mess. We then adjourned to a barn where L/Cpl Herz had a concert rigged up. There was a crowd of all nations here and we had a regular good rough up "Digger's" concert. A U.S. Army chap gave a couple of songs. Wiseman once with J.C. Williamson was a good help and a chap of the 21st came forward and offered his services. He had a fine voice and a good command of all the latest topical sounds. A balmy, dark night full of gun flashes rumble of guns
