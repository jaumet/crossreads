  
 2.  Those last two mails were very close together, one on the Sunday and one on the following Friday.  It was so good to hear of you, and your doings and about home & everything & I believe you have been going out a little more lately from what I gather, that is good news.     It is so strange to me to think of there being another minister & his wife at Bourke Street now, I loved being there for lots of things & the people too & I don't quite like to think that we are not going back there.  Wouldn't I be homeless now if I hadn't you to come back to?  Of course I know I could rent a house & all that sort of thing, but I mean a home! Father you asked if I had been getting my military pay all right here and I have until this half month; I don't know why it has not come as usual & am only going to give them another mail before hunting them up.  Last month it was a few days late & though this time it is a week, still perhaps it is all right.  Anyhow I have a tongue & I'm learning to manage things by myself much as I dislike it & always will.  The remittances have been fortnightly and regular all the time.      If I come home I shall not neglect to safeguard myself about it all I can. Since I last wrote to you, a week back, I have not had one atom of news from any of our soldier-boys, am sorry for your sakes & incidentally my own too.  It has been a very long week, very long, and to be only about 6 days journey away from Rid & yet have his last letter three weeks old makes me restless, specially as I have had no reply to that cable I sent him a week ago telling him I was planning to return
