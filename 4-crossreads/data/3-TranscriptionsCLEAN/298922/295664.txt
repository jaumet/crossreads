 Inspected by Lt. General Chauvel our old Brigadier this morning. I go so soon as the Railway is available to take me, so will see Jerusalem very soon I hope now. 
 Current topic of conversation is the failure of Conscription. This may let JOE get away but I do hope he won't throw up his job. We all remember the anxiety before he got it & it is more secure than ever a Station Manager's.
