<p>I went to the concert in the evening with my aviator pal from the West Indies.   It was an awful show &ndash; even allowing that we are in a prison-camp.   The pianist was excellent in an overture, then came a stupid French farce &amp; then Colonel Lord Farnham gave "Off to Philadelphia".   The Noble Lord is a genial personality with a likeable manner but an appalling voice!   However, "Philadelphia" got much polite applause.</p>
<p>Then came an English sketch which was so bad that it was quite good.   The "heroine's" final "Damn you! John" in the first act was a scream, but, alas, 'twas meant to be tragic.   Farnham appeared in the sketch &amp; is a better actor than he is a singer.</p>
<p>Sun 7th<br/>I was tea-ed this afternoon by Rundle, a little fat lieut. from Bristol or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Sardines, toast, cake, de Reszke cigarettes &amp; good tea provided such a splash as I have not had for ages.</p>
