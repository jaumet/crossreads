<p>The Heliograph is playing a most important part in these desert operations and I don't know what we should do without it Despatch Rider would be totally out of the question. The only trouble about it &ndash; or rather I might say &ndash; disadvantage &ndash; is that the instrument requires an experienced operator &ndash; both for operating and also in reading it. But fortunately I have at present a good supply of good and efficient operators.<br/>The telephone lines to the outposts are laid along the sand from headquarters to the various posts and we frequently have great trouble by having these lines broken by the various patrols who are trekking across the desert. The worst trouble is at night because the patrol does not realise that the line is broken and consequently ride on totally oblivious to the damage they do, it cannot be helped. In the daytime when the line is broken it can soon be seen and remedied or a report will be sent back to say that the line is broken. The unfortunate linesman has great difficulty to find the ends of the broken wire in the dark. He will run one end through his hands as he goes along but the horses</p>
