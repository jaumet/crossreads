Fuller &amp;amp; Major White in Cairo.<br/>Another false alarm this time no one knows why.  How willing &amp;amp; anxious the men become on hearing the word to "get Ready".  Blankets are rolled in heaps &amp;amp; Kit Bags filled with surplus clothes &amp;amp; placed handy for removal.  The Camp is cleaned up &amp;amp; Tents just ready to strike when the word comes to 'Dismantle' everything.</p>

Proudfoot who was attached to 6th Reg. as instructor was killed at Persian Gulf.<br/>Col. Fuller, Major White &amp;amp; Lieu Chisholm drew out of mess &amp;amp; started one for themselves.

There are 6 prophets or Apostles according to the Mohammad religion namely Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus &amp;amp; Mohammad.
