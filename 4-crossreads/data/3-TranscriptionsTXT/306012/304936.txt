The upper & lower houses of the French parliament have unanimously passed a bill calling up their 1920 class, i.e., boys who become 18 this year.  They will not be sent into the line until the spring of next year unless urgently required.  Wonderful speeches were made in the house during the passing of the Bill showing the splendid solidity & patriotism of the French nation.From 1st Aug. it is proposed to increase French rates of pay as follows:- Privates from 25 cent. to 50 cent. per day, Corporals from 42 cent. to 75 cent. per day.  Sergeants' rates are also being raised.The number of sick, wounded & gassed cases evacuated by the Ambulance during the month of July was 2376.  While running the A.D.S. we had of our own personnel 1 killed & 3 wounded (all forward).  The Lance Corporal killed was an old 1st A.G.H. man & very popular.  He was awarded the D.C.M. during Paschendale last year when he was wounded.
