<p>Deir el Bellah [Deir el Belah]<br/>13th April, Thursday<br/>I thought I  was right about the old building at Khan Yunis &ndash; it was built about 1172 by Richard Coeur de Lion on his crusade.  I &amp; another fellow are now out on our own at Dei el Bela which is about 8 miles from Gaza in which 30000 turks are now reported.  We are going to attack it shortly with 3 divisions of infantry &amp; one in reserve, 2 divisions of cavalry, 8 monitors from the sea, much fairly heavy artillery &ndash; which are rationed for each gun continuous firing for 48 hours &amp; 8 tanks so if it is not muddled up we ought to take the place.<br/>On Tuesday Riches &amp; I set out from Khan Yunis to get camels in response to one of their brilliantly lucid telegrams saying "send two men to 2nd Immobile Sect. at Railhead to escort camels".<br/>We thought we should be back the same day.  We did not know what the Immobile Sect. was or where it was</p>
