  
 Sunday 25 February 1917 [24 February 1918] Day of mixed feelings.  All A.A.N.S. [Australian Army Nursing Service] up to Matron 10 a.m. to be lectured re red capes.  Matron Quelly sarcastic & Lamb equally so in some instances.  Andrews long-winded of course & determined to be in the scene in some way. - and we are here "for all time" & no moving on as we used to think.  I apologise for Lamb afterwards & find she & Doonar are the only offenders among us - others will pass.
