 such as a heap of old trench mortar bombs on the side of a sap or 
 the remains of an old French farming cart which had been in No 
 Mans Land in front of us.  By means of these guides we were able 
 to locate the trenches which we had occupied and out of which we 
 attaacked on 28th July.  Not much of the trenches remain now and by 
 the time spring comes they will be entirely obliterated and over all 
 will be a growth of grass and field flowers.  Nature is a wonderful

 by stumps and blasted undergrowth will be leafy glades of the

 days will be overgrown with yellow charlock like so many golden

 Australiaxx never had much chance to identify herself with the 
 custom of name giving as we generally occupied trenches which 
 had already received the necessary attention.  One typical 
 Australian name only I remember and that was at the intersectio n
