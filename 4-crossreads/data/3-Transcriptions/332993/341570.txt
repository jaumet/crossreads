<p>been this way for several days past. So yesterday we put in a franc each &amp; got a supply of vegetables from Bailleul.<br/>[Next few lines in shorthand]<br/>Saturday August 11, 1917. (1104.).<br/>Last night about 3.a.m. an enemy plane dropped a number of bombs around our camp one falling about half a chain from the cook House and shook the ground we were sleeping on.<br/>Every one started cleaning the wagon &amp; moved off about 10 a.m. to the Parade ground at Bailleul where we were reviewed by the C. of 2.9.C. General Plumer, accompanied by General Monash, our own Brigader and several others. They were highly pleased and we returned arriving at the Transport camp about 2.30.<br/>I made some service rings yesterday &amp; this evening out of the driving bands of enemy shells. I varnished them when finished.</p>
<p>Sunday Aigist 12, 1917. (1105)<br/>Last night was very wet in the early part of the night, but it is fine to day. We have a half holiday this afternoon &amp; I spent it writing letters. We are to go to St. Omer on Wednesday, probably taking 2 days for the journey, &amp; it is possible we may not come back to this sector.<br/>[Next 8 lines in shorthand]<br/>We are to move to morrow morning.</p>
<p>Monday  August 13, 1917 (1106).<br/>We were all up bright and early &amp; got away by 10 O'Clock</p>
