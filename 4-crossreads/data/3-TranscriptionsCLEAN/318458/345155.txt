  
 We caused a great deal of interest on arrival in Colombo.  The destruction of the "Emden" concerned the people of India and Ceylon directly.  Crowds of boats came out into the harbour and cheered, and one could detect their interested gaze as they scanned our ship for evidence of shot holes. 
 The transports cheered us also with great enthusiasm. 
 I visited "Wesley College" on Tues. 17th and was presented to the assembled school of about 400 boys as coming from the "Sydney" which put the "Emden" out of action.  Immediately there was great cheering.  After prayers someone at the door called for Cheers for the Sydney and then at his call of "Three cheers for the Sydney", a most hearty response was given.  It was pleasant to see the evidence of loyalty to the Empire in these people.
