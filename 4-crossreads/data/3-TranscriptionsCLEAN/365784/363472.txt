3.are terrified that we are going to be torpedoed & they sleep in their clothes to be ready for the worst. I suggested that they should also put their lifebelts on, but they think the matter too serious to joke about.
This is Monday & we expect to reach Plymouth on Friday morning & if they give us a special train we should be in London in time for dinner.
Hoping you are all well & with kindest regards to all from
