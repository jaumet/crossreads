 St. Gratien &amp; Querrieu.  Practically all the civilians have left these villages which are too small to have shops in them.  On Monday evening two of us went over to St. Gratien &amp; last night we walked right through the wood to Allonville. 
 Thurs. 6th June I see from the "Matin" some marvellous increases in the populations of large French towns since the war.  I notice that none of the northern towns nor Paris are mentioned.  At the outbreak of hostilities Marseille had a population of 600,000.  Now it is approximately 1,000,000. Lyon (France's 3rd largest town) has gone from 530,000 to 740,000 not including the suburbs and surrounding villages which had 65,000 inhabitants at the time of the mobilization and now have 100,000.
