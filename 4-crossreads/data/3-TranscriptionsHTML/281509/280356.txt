<p>1916 May 13<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Safely through another night. Sea continues as calm as mill-pond. Destroyers come &amp; go convoying us all the way. A British Submarine passed us this afternoon, first I've seen. Thankful it was flying British ensign. <br/>About 6 p.m. a submarine alarm was sounded -- for practice. Did not realise twas only for practice at first, great excitement &amp; scurrying to get to places, &amp; don life-belts.  Chap sprained his ankle in the rush.<br/>M</p>
