 Friday 24 August 1917. 
 Turned out at 7 a.m. Fed camels and later on took them for a dip in the surf. The breakers bowled a couple of them over. Saddled up after breakfast&nbsp; and &nbsp;watered camels, &amp; filled &quot;fantasies&quot; 
 Did a little more washing. 
 Allied planes keeping a good watch over us today. Troops moving out from, &amp; others moving in to the beach rest camp. 
 [Transcriber&#39;s note: &quot;fantasies&quot; were large rectangular cross-section water containers used in the desert war, also sometimes used for hot tea.
