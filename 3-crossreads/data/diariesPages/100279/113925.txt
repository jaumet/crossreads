just missing my ribs this shell killed 2 men wounded 3 more a few yards from me but strange to say none of my party were hit, we lost no time in reaching the dump I can tell you for we were pretty safe once there although he continued to sling the shells over, one big shell this afternoon landed fair in a party of 10 killed 9 outright badly wounded the other one pretty hot you know, our job was carrying duck boards up to "Cocoa" trench they were fairly heavy, after getting our first load up we had to go back to Flers tramway for another load of rivetting material by this time it was quite dark, I had to guide our party back. Now this might seem an easy job, but believe me it was just the reverse
