monetary matters in connection with my trip. Inspection of Division by "Dug Haigh". Still raining heavily.
Thursday 30.8.17
Days seem very long after having my time so fully occupied. Tom Roos had to drop his stripe on account of having overstayed his leave, 14 days in Blighty. Rations very young.
Friday 31.8.17
Colonel acting A.D.M.S. No rations issued, had to exist on our emergency rations. Five more of the boys went to Blighty on leave. Pay day, only able to draw 15 francs as I am slightly overdrawn for the first time since my arrival in France, have generally managed to store a little "down south" for a rainy day.
