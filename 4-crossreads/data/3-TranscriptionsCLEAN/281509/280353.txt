 Arrive in Alexandria at 5.20 a.m. after a rather uncomfortable ride. taken straight on to wharf & embarked on S. S. Caledonian. 15.000 Australian troops said to have left Tel-el-Kabir last night embarking all morning. Delta of Nile, low flat land, marshes. Pull out into stream & stay there all night. Bunk on deck. 3,000 troops on board. All the Nowra Waratah boys on board. Also our shipmates on S. S. Armadale, the Engineers. Rather strange coincidence.
