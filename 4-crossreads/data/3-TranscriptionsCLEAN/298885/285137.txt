3 or 4 a day
May 15th - 17At 8 oclock this morning we left Monument Wood and proceeded on our way towards "BERLIN",??, stopping at VELU Wood at 10.15AM
To reach this wood we came across country on our bikes up hill and down dale, which, covered in green grass looked to us like a huge piece of undulated green cloth.
This position here is very comfortable and as far as concealment is concerned it is. At as our huts are built into and down in an embankment
