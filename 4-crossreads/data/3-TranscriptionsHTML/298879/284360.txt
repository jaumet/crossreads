<p>April 1915<br/>Wednesday 14<br/>We saw two submarines or rather their conning towers. Today both Batt left ship &amp; went in boats to shore fore some exercise &amp; a skirmish. We went through beautiful sweet smelling country rich in clover growth. The land seems to one vast cultivation right to the water's edge. The people the few whom we saw were very clean &amp; a skin almost white. They spoke very good English. Came back on board about 8.15 PM.</p>
<p>Thursday 15<br/>Did some signalling practice. Washed a few clothes. Airship or rather a balloon can be seen anchored to a warship. It looks very odd up in the air. All sorts of rumours of Turkish atrocities brought on board by marines. Think they are a bit far fetched but time will tell. We all put some Dubbin on our boots. We are still anchored in the harbour but expect to be off to the Dardanelles any time now. Got a hair cut &amp; shave</p>
