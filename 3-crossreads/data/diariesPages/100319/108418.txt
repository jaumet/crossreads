Got up today. It was fine with gleams of a weak sun. The ground now covered with fallen leaves and a good heavy wind would clear the trees. Rumours that 4th Division are to move up again soon and stories of a big Yank concentration towards Meuse. Remained in room all day and except for a visit from Matthews nothing of interest.

The General called round at about 10 with his car ? a closed and neat car-de-luxe with its red pennon flying. The morning was dull and foggy. First visited the T.M. Battery and the G. inspected them rousing hard and kicking up the devil's delight. Several people very very upset and hurt by his caustic remarks and I don't doubt there will be an immediate and continuing improvement there. On re-entering the car the G. sat back and laughed and we both laughed
