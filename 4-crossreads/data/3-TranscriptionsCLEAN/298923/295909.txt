  
 31 August 1918 Saturday (X to X crossed out) Bronchitis gone & am OK.  Have ordered a Book-  L.H in  "Australia in Egypt" to be delivered to you- not yet printed but on the way-   X I am wondering how you & Day are managing in that Big House & Garden all by yourselves & know how you must miss Joe. All my love to you both & hope you get a good tenant but NO one will look after the place like you have done & it falls to pieces very easily- Your loving son FW X
