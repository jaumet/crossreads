I would like to go there, as I have an open invitation to Tommy's place, it would be a good idea to go there when I'm convalescent. Golly! I would like to see his cheerful dial again.</p>
<p>Well, Mother dear, I'd better turn off at the meter hadn't I, and I shall probably send you a cable just before leaving for the "fun" though of course if I'm broke (&amp; quite likely too) I won't be able to, but in my case don't you worry about me one bit, I'll be O.K. and remember &ndash; KEEP SMILING<br/>.</p>
<p>With Love to all the family, - and OTHERS (Hazel will do that part!)</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
