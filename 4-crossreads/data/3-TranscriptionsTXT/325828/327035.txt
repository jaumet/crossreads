Easterly wind (appropriate isn't it) blowing.  I quite expect to see another fall of snow by morning.  I think it is nearly time this weather took a tumble to itself & give gave Spring a chance.By the way, I ran across Capt. Parkinson (a very red haired S.H.S boy) who is over from France on Furlough.  He is with the 14th. Fld Amblce, & when I made myself known, asked very kindly how you were, & wished to be remembered to you.  I knew him at Tel-el-Kebir & also at Serapeum when he was with the 1st. Fld Ambulance.I am keeping in splendid health, & sincerely trust this finds you well.  Give my love to Mother, Wal, Ol, & Anna.  I will try & get letters to them written this week.  Must close, Father dear,With much love to yourself,Your loving son,J  Leo L. Waterhouse.
