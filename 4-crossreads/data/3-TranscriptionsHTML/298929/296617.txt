<p>War takes its toll of bravest and best of men they say<br/>And true it is for all our hopes were garneded in a day<br/>The colonel, major, adjutant, were shattered by a shell,<br/>As gentlemen they lived and as heroes all they fell.</p>
<p>Yes they got our brave old colonel still I guess he's marching on<br/>To a greater path of glory just as such as he has won<br/>And the boys who used to follow when the enemy defied,<br/>Will be prouder still to follow when they cross the great divide</p>
