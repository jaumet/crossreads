 1918 Wed 24th (cont.) Lessons are now in full swing at the lager, thanks to the exertions of Colonel C.H. Bury, whom I met first in Karlsruhe. 
 (In return for years about Tian Shan I tell him all about Papeete etc in the Beatrice Grimshaw style.)   Suddenly remembered with a gasp where I had seen our mathematics teacher (H.E. Balfour, a long grave, Canadian B.A.).   He was in last night's concert as a black-garbed pierr ette  with a scarlet garter encircling a silk-stockinged leg! 
 His garb did  not  give him poise;   his staring eyes betrayed a lack of aplomb.   The French teacher is Ward, an awfully decent young French-Englishman;   our German Master is the Censor (the village schoolmaster); while Collier, ex. "Hobart Mercury", presides at shorthand. 
 Wed 1st May Blue.
