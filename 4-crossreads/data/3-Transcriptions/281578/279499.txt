<p>corner of the roof knocked in by shell) to write to Elsie &amp; home, a chap there had a bottle of ink &amp; I took advantage of the opportunity to fill my fountain pen, hence the writing in ink once again. Had a drink of cocoa, &amp; went to B Coy's trench &amp; had a yarn to Boo, Eldridge &amp; Bradford. Their luck is dead out, they only have a trench they dug, &amp; haven't a sleeping pozzy, whereas our company struck good covered in pozzies. Fritz sent some big shells into the wood tonight, after our guns. Saty.11 May<br/>The brutes had us up at 3 a.m. &amp; we began digging a dug-out for headquarters by the side of the railway line at 4. They call this a rest too. Fritz made us hide by sending over some shells on to the line near us, but they missed, &amp; that's the main thing. Knocked off at 8, &amp; I had a sleep till dinner time. I finished my long letter to Elsie &amp; home tonight, gave it to "Darky" Austin, who gets them signed by Darcy Irvine without being read, so I can write a decent letter. Read a "Sydney Mail" by candle light in the trench for a while, &amp; went to bye-bye at 10.30 p.m. Sunday 12 May Had a long night's sleep, didn't get up till 7.30 for breakfast, no digging for a wonder.</p>
