<p>2.  Military doing any such thing, though I suppose it ought to have occurred to me.  You'll overlook it I know, for it is my first experience of the sort &amp; even Wal said he would never have thought of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very good to get the home letters dear Father &amp; Mother, but it must take you both ages to write them.  You seem to have been having a very gay garden since we left, and a very gay time with thieves too, the latter is awfully trying &amp; too bad altogether!<br/>While I think of it you asked one question that I may or may not have answered in the meantime in one of my letters, it was whether my attachment to 21st.  Hospital was honorary.  Yes it was quite, anything at all that I may find to do over here or anywhere else I may move, for that matter, will be quite voluntary work without payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Pension it costs me &amp;pound10 a month and washing 2/- a dozen extra; fares everywhere are high and it is a dirty place &amp; very hard on one's clothes specially also with such a hot sun that fades things like magic, so that living altogether is very dear here.  Still I have in Rid's &amp; my joint account about &amp;pound80, more than my fare home, that is calculating to the end of this month.<br/>Now about the going off of Rid &amp; Le.  Did you get a cable that Wal sent on 23rd., saying "Rid, Leo, gone."  We squabbled over who was to have the privilege of sending it specially as it was my idea first, but I am to have the honour of sending the next so we came to peace terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not dare to try &amp; put anything more definite than that, for fear they might not pass it at all, &amp; only hope that much passed the Censor.</p>
