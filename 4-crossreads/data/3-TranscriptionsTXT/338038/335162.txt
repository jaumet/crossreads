 My dear Father &amp; Mother This week's mail has brought me your ever welcome letters. Father's two of 23rd &amp; 28th Sep Mother's of 26th Sep and Pat's of 29th also Herald of 30th Sept &ndash; Pat's letter I am acknowledging separately. The same mail also brought me letters from Sis &amp; "Tatters" so you can see I am not faring too badly. The best news of course to me is to hear that you are all well. Personally I have been keeping in tip-top form except the last two days &ndash; just a little bit out of gear inside, but as we now have a topping cook at the Battery, a couple of days careful feeding will set me right. I note from the paragraph enclosed in Mother's letter the selection of the Red Cross Committee X Also D'Arcy's letter of 23rd Sept &ndash; If you are writing D.C.G. please tell him I am hoping to get a line off to him by next if not mail &ndash; and give him and the kiddies all good wishes. T.
