  
 to a shovel said, You men have to dig a footpath through this sand hill. Each of the three men blankly refused saying It was a physical impossibility & when hearing of their condition the Sergt said Oh! I dont want men like you! go back & report to the Quartermaster! & he will look after you properly!. This foot path was to be cut so that officers in walking to their bath each morning would not have the bother of walking up a little hill. 
 The next morning the Sergt Major sent the Sentry to carry rolls of blankets big enough to be a load for two strong men, but the Corporal in charge saw how farcical it was & said. Isn't it awful to think, that a Sergt Major who would send a man in your condition to do work like this, is put in charge of men? Why! he ought to be up in the firing line himself! 
 The next work was to go with a hand cart to Etaples (the town) for rations. 
 To get away from such a man as this Sergt Major, the Sentry went on this trip & when he found the man in charge of the party had come across in the same boat & belonged to his Battalion he arranged to stay with his friend. 
 During these three days owing to these idiotic orders, the Sentry was only able to go to the Hospital once, although his feet were very bad & giving great pain when walking. 
 Shortly after this, the Sentry was sent for & passed by the board of Doctors being marked to go to Blighty & to be free from all work. 
 However while waiting for a Hospital Ship to leave he decided to stay & assist his friend thus escaping all parades for duty, roll calls, & parades for meals & having much more freedom & lattitude in every way the time passed pleasantly, besides being able to attend Hospital regularly 
 After about a week of this, he was paraded with a squad of men "For England" & it was with the very greatest pleasure that he left the Australian base
