7th Training BattalionHeliopolis
25 Nov 1915We have been altered from the 6th to the 7th Training BattalionSo may men have been arriving lately that additional Battalions have had to be formed and as we deal in units of the 7th Brigade we are the 7th, a lucky number
While [indecipherable] a hearty meal at the Sergeants mess this evening after having seen to the reception and feeding of 300 men just arrived, I had the extreme pleasure of receiving letters from you dear ones in Australia. All the fretting cares of a Quartermaster Sergeant vanished for a spell and I was with you for a moment watching you all fit up a surprise packet for Daddy at the front. I can see the picture clear enough as your goodly words have written it.
All good unselfish hearts joining together with their kindly thoughts for this indifferent warriors welfare
