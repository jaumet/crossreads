1st to 6th FebThis week is merely  a repetition of last with the exception that we have discontinued the long hours & now finish at 6 pm. Of course, having the opportunity again, I now take my French lessons from Madame Alice. The two Miss Beguians, her friends, having found some soldier loves have dispensed with our company. They are not much loss, so the feeling is mutual. Like the rest of the empty headed, painted dolls here
6th Feb:- SundayTo-day is very cold again but we work as usual until 1 pm, turning the office topsy-turvy &  moving to a new room. Just as dirty of course. After dinner    &  a short rest we fell in the evening in the noisy occupation of listening to the bank in Esbekia
