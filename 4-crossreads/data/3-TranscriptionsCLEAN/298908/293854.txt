I strolled round the Hoe for a while & then went down town again & made out for Devonport, by this time all cars were stopped from running for it was just about impossible for them to push through the crowds so I had to walk out, here I met Starkey & his Yorkshire girl & shortly after met Miss Nissen & we went out to the Theatre Royal to see "The Boy".  The place was crowded & just before the curtain rose the orchestra played & all sung the "Brabaconne" Marseillaise, & God Save the King amidst an almost indescribable scene of enthusiasm, & when we had finished this a naval officer from one of the boxes got up & said "Gentlemen the war is won" & then there was a renewal of cheering & etc.  At last the play got going & during the course of it the actors were constantly getting champagne from the occupants of the boxes, & very nearly got drunk
