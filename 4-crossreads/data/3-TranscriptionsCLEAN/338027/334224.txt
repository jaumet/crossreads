Our Light Horse Brigades have had fearful losses at Popes Hill.
Thursday, 12 August, 1915A quiet day, we only took down about 50 patients all day, the enemy were very quiet, and our men are resting a bit on the hill, water is the main trouble, we have had our supply curtailed to a pint a day but they are making tea for us, each man does his own cooking, & some good feeds result, we all have our little dug outs, & they are well furnished with things the Turks left when they retreated.  Our war boats & artillery must be cutting the enemy up, it is rumoured that Bosnia's army has arrived.  Another rumour is that all the Aust troops are going off for a spell God knows they want it they are only shadows of themselves, how they stick it causes admiration from everybody they will not retreat.
Friday, 13 August, 1915There were very few casualties brought down to-day and consequently we all thought we were going to get a spell, but we had a days digging & filling sand bags to make a shelter for our wounded just about sunset we were surprised by three bursts of shrapnel over us then followed a terrific air pressure and an awful report and earth blown up twenty feet into the air only a few yards from us, this was a Jack Johnson fired by a new gun the Turks have brought up three more were fired in the same place none did any damage as they missed the battery they tried to find but they gave us a nasty shock.  The moral effect of our guns must be awful amongst the Turks, if you climb the next hill & risk snipers one can see piles of Turkish dead lying in a gully, it is an awful sight although the weather is hot it is better than otherwise but flies are our chief trouble.
