December 191611th   I have been out on the same job again to-night & we have got to within 50 yds of the "sunken road" which is about 800 yds. from the 2nd  supports.  Fritz was not bombarding us so hard to-night, but a schrapnell caught one of the party, wounding him in the arm.To-day Fritz has been sending over a new shell which is almost silent in coming over & which has a double & very severe explosion & very severeWe have not seen any of them before & it is said to be a new kind he is adopting.
