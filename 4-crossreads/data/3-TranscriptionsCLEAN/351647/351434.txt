Dear Mrs. Jack,
So sorry to get your note tonight & to learn you were laid up again in Omrah.  What rotten luck, every year you seem to be there about the same time, I hope this is the last annual affair of the kind.  I am most awfully sorry, was it one of those red & black spiders that did the damage?  Yes I know how unsympathetic people generally are about spider bites & bee stings & things like that, I don't know why as they are just as dangerous & painful as lots of other things & including wounds which no one laughs at.  However I hope by this you are well again & your usual live self.  I had a letter from Lerida at Burrabogie, she said she was going to Tog after.  I didn't know she was such a pal of Mrs. Kathryn's.
Things are pretty rotten, the weather is vile gain, nothing but boisterous & cold winds, & stacks of rain.  The whole country is bogged & mud abounds.  Its a desolate heartbreaking place these times, & its so galling when we could be hammering hell out of Fritz if G.A. would only give us a bit more fine weather.
