 some other crop, the weight being considerable, &nbsp;To get an easy 
 carriage for the basket the weight must be as nearly perpendicular 
 over the feet as possible, hence her back must be straight and her 
 head erect, and to prevent the basket falling, the walk must be 
 even and graceful. &nbsp;We passed hundreds of these women stepping it 
 out along the roads bound for the village markets. &nbsp;Occasionally 
 they are accompanied by t heir men folk in which case the man would 
 ride on a donkey whilst the woman would walk behind and carry the 
 load on her head. &nbsp;There is no doubt we spoil our women in Australia

 then when I put an overcoat on, I had this burnt in places, not to 
 mention &nbsp;a big bit burnt out of my hat which was blazing away freely 
 what time I was searching my clothes for the cause of the smell of 
 burning. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alexandria is not a very interesting place which is
