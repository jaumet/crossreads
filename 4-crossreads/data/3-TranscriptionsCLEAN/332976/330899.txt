  
 July 1917 bridges to allow traffic to pass through, & we also had to "break" on an average of 3 times a day. 20th   I went to Senlis this morning to have my teeth attended to, & will probably be staying a couple of days. The "Divisional Train" arrived in Corbie this morning & passed through the same procedure as the three brigades.   General Birdwood also, was here to-day, but was unable to attend the inspection on the previous days. 21st   I am at Senlis now in the 8th Field Hospital & the dentist has made a start on my teeth We had very heavy rain during the afternoon
