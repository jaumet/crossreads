<p>6.<br/>Wrote to Mrs Barrie's sister, hope to be able to visit a few places. There are so many Australians in London that I dont suppose we shall feel very strange. Some of the nicest Sisters of this Unit are going with us, so we expect to be a very happy little family. Sister Allen's fianc&eacute;e is a M.O. (Medical officer) at Harefield park, so it is just the thing for her.</p>
