 Bill & I went to the Divisional Baths about 2 miles away & came back clean & bright Good supply of  [indecipherable]  water & new underclothes. So far I seem to be "chat" proof. Bill is not a bit "windy" He was loading gravel today when some 9" stuff came over The first coupl fell 100 yds or so away he thought the next would be the same & was & was very intently looking upwards to find out if you could see a shell falling He did not see it but got well splattered with mud & water as it burst in a big hole only a few yards away His account of it is very funnie 
 Friday 22nd Finished the O Pip proper still a bit of digging & cleaning up to do. It is two storied affair about 15 ft high but only about 6 ft are above ground The walls are 2 to 3 ft thick & the top 4 ft so it will take some knocking to pieces Payed
