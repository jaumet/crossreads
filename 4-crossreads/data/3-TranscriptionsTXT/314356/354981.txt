December 7a photograph shews his badge as English.  Across then to 'Q' for A.I.F. list, and found one J.L. Turner, a Capt. in 5th Div. Train A.F.A. [Australian Field Artillery]From Williams and Norgate the book of Mestrovic has been issued - 750 copies at 25/-.  Another interesting announcement is from Lane - a Bundle of Aussies - with illustrations by Jim S.
Yesterday morning in to Chatelat to Pay Office - and find no money order through yet from C.P. - while notification from the bank was posted Dec. 24.
25.Post away this morning Morris' 'Hollow Land' and Stephen's 'Hill of Vision':  and a bundle of old and Dec. 'Aussies'.
December 726.Afternoon to Chatelat in the Chat with Ken A. and Mick - they on to Brussels.  Pass to Bruges and Antwerp through this morning, so to the Pay Office:  and no money through!  So the problem stands at 'funds'.  Will see Geoff in the morning, failing that, call on the Amb. people.
A keenly clear night, high dark skies frozenly starr'd:  and a crescent brilliant moon:  the pines black-cut shadows, and the ground by the Chateau vaguely green in the cold light.  If only the weather lasts.
'Thais' on at the Brussels O.H. on the 9th so leaving here the day after tomorrow, D.V.
