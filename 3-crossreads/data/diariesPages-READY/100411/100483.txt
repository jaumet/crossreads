Dear Mr. Armstrong
You will be very pleased to hear that your dear boy has been transferred to the Base. He was improving every day but very slowly, however probably the change will do him good. I hope you will continue to get good news of him that soon he will be home with you in Australia.
Yours sincerelyJ. GraySister I/C
