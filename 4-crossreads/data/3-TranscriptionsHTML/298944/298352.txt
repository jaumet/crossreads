<p>&amp; French, of an offensive over the whole of the Somme area.</p>
<p>Very rough motor ride over by roads during which we tried to sleep, but failed miserably. Somewhere about three oclock in the morning (it may have been earlier) we descended just outside Amiens, &amp; marched to a big school, where we found our transport had already established themselves. Had tea &amp; went to sleep on the top floor of the private quarters.</p>
