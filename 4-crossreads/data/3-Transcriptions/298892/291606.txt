<p>We have shifted camp since I last wrote and hence I am somewhat late with my letter this week. Our new camp is not nearly so comfortable as the one we left. I am afraid my photography will suffer in consequence of the move as we have no place in our present quarters that I can convert into a dark room. Also I will have to take on gaslight instead of daylight paper as there is very little sun <strike> these days</strike>  to print photos. It rains every day now and I suppose we can reconcile ourselves to some weeks of it, now that winter is coming on.<br/>Our new camp isn't half a mile from the old one and I can see no object for the move, unless the idea is to prevent us becoming too comfortably settled for fear we will never want to move. We are in huts just the same as at the other camp.<br/>There is a small camp for german prisoners just behind us. I took a trip over to have a look at them yesterday. They seem perfectly happy and are well cared for. They are quartered in tents inside a barbed wire enclosure about twelve feet high, and of course sentries are posted on each of the four sides. There are only about 150 prisoners in all. To my surprise most of them were fair, both in hair and complexion, and nothing like what is supposed to be the typical hun. They are a good stamp of men physically.</p>
