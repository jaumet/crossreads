54it. However on seeing Redfern I find CO has cancelled order & said that I was not available so thus far I do not know whether I am going or not at present. Snow is still falling
Tonight received word from de Vere that order was temporarily suspended & that I was to go to Brigade with Thomas as Brigade Claims Officer but that in meantime I stand by. After this I attended a lecture on New Guinea & heard that it rains 269 day in year & averages 1 in per day - that place is full of malaria, crocodiles alligators & cannibals - that natives save 3 tribes are treacherous. Just a nice place to avoid I should think
6-2-19 ThursNo news through to day re transfer - so am sitting still - refusing to attend parades or do anything for the company Redfern & [Fry] have received sudden orders to sail for Australia to day
Have seen the post red robin today Generally there are plenty of chaffinch but no robins. Just now the accumulated snow on the roof became dislodged & tons of snow fell on to ground, Pity help anyone caught below they would have a rather rough time of it Went for a walk after dinner
The whiteness of the road & the high bank
