<p>18 Monday<br/>Everything was cleaned up during the morning ready for departure.  Fell in at 2 pm &amp; marched to the railway siding about a kilometre the other side of Buire.  Owing to being ill I never carried my equipment or blankets.  We entrained &amp; left about 5 pm for Vignacourt about 24 miles distance, arriving there about 10 pm.  We are billeted about 10 mins from the railway station.</p>
<p>19 Tuesday<br/>Went on sick parade this morning, I have nearly lost my voice through the cold I have got.  Our billets aren't up to the standard here, we are very cramped for room.  This is a fair size town, with a large catherdal.  It started snowing at dinner time &amp; is still continuing.  I think it has set in.  Got three letters by todays mail, but they were old ones.</p>
<p>20 Wednesday<br/>Doing nothing all day.  Feeling pretty crook &amp; very weak.  Leave is given to Amiens but it is very difficult to get in &amp; out of that place, as there is no train service here you have to depend upon a lift in a motor lorry or else walk, it is about ten miles from here.  It was rather a nice day today, the sun was shining nearly all day, but it wasn't too warm.</p>
