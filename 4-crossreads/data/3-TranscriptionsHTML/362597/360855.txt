<p>Friday 7/1/16 (16)<br/>It is still raining &amp; we cannot go up on deck to sleep. We were granted permission to go up on deck to sleep this morning. We were issued with covers for our mattresses but I don't bother with the mattress. I just take my 2 Blankets &amp; pillow.</p>
<p>We had a lecture in the afternoon from Capt Wylie all about "germs". My word we will learn a lot before we have finished this job.</p>
<p>I had to sleep on three forms side by side &amp; I had a real good night's rest.</p>
