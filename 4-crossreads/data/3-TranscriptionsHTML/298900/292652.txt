<p>road to get soil when a shell came over killed one man named [indecipherable] &amp; one horse &amp;  slightly wounded 3 others.   Well we buried the horse, when a couple more came across but not actually in the camp then just on 4 oclock one landed right in the Camp, wounding abut 5 men &amp; making a mess of a few of the huts.   By this time things were getting warm &amp; the Colonel ordered everyone into some big trenches.    Then just as tea was on &amp; plans were being formed to restart revetting after tea two more came over so once more the Hospital was emptied out.   Plans were then made to shift everyone for the night &amp; the unit were billeted in the Dispensary &amp; other houses which were in the village itself.   The decision to leave the Camp for the night was much strengthened by two more which came over about 9 oclock one man being hit near the Q.M. Store.   Altogether t'is a very trying time as there is really nothing</p>
