1916   WEDNESDAY 15   NOV.
Fine but fairly cold. The 27th Bat & our infantry battalion had a sham fight with the 25th Bat & their infantry. We had to fight a rear guard action & we won the day. I was wheel driver in the firing battery waggon & had a real good day, & we did very well I think. Poss & I went down to 28 Camp & I took Syd Lyddel's place on horse picket when I came back as the poor kid was pretty sick.
