  
 [Friday 7 April 1916] 
 (Big mail tonight Mother Joe Daisy Jean Mathis Miss Chase Cuthbert Fetherstonehough  May Harrison & Papers from Joe- Cannot answer all.) I see my missing Diary is one containing 1 in Gallipoli Notes, also a sketch I made of our position & some of my letters must be in Davy Jones locker.  Still I'm not, so that's all right. Went to see some Howling Dervishes dance tonight mostly naked  men  & Tom Toms & Backsheesh Senussi chucking it, & we are to occupy Kharga Oasis, West of Oasis Junction.  see map
