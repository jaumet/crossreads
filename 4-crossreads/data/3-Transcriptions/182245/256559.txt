<p>13 TUESDAY</p>
<p>Fine but dull &amp; warm. It has started</p>
<p>to get muddy again now. The</p>
<p>thaw has set in. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>horses ect in morning &amp; out</p>
<p>exercising horses in afternoon.</p>
<p>While out I tried to send a wire to</p>
<p>mother from &quot;Croix du Bac&quot;, but</p>
<p>could not do so. Things very</p>
<p>quiet at line all day.</p>
