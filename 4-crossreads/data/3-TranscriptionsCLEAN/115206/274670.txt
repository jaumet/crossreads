 Blaney Tronville.  D.R. Weather fine and clear. Wemnt for a spin to Bonnay and Callanvelle. Had a talk with some Yankee Engineers on a Bridge job. Bob  Butcher came down - had the usual talk. A few planes  - a - la Fritz across after heavy guns. Rumored that Fritz had captured Estairs and S-illo up Flanders way. I sincerely trust that such is not the case.
