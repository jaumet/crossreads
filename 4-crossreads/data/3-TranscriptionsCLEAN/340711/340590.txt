Further work of organization in afternoon but sudden and heavy storm broke. Great drops of rain with tremendous gusts of wind. Thirty one tents, including Battery Office, P.O., were blown down. Only by placing two bunks under cross pole of my tent could B. and I prevent ours from going the way of others. Was stuck up in motor car by mud on leaving camp.
Thursday 6.Wrote letters and went to bed early.
Friday 7.Awoke feeling fit and fresh. Rotten drill under Lieut. M. Foot drill and talk about Guards and Sentry Duty, S.S. and M.D. invited B. and I and her cousin M. from National Bank to dinner at Federal. From there we went to "Under Fire" at Theatre Royal. Supper at "Blue Bird". Caught car home at 1 a.m.
Saturday 8.Went to Art Gallery with S. and M.D. Some fine pictures --- but though seemingly a larger collection than at Adelaide, not much larger, and consider latter's alcoves afford better scope for light. Adelaide's the better collection. Bric a brac etc. Melbourne very fine.
Sunday 9.Slept at Federal Palace---till 11 a.m. Had dinner then took s. to Rev. D. and took service at Footscray. About 300 present. Good service.
Monday 10.Went in to see S. Went T. Gardens. Not feeling too fit. Mooted staying in camp Tuesday evening---then arranged to come in. Diarroehia all day.
Tuesday 11.Diarroehia worse. By four o'clock could not stand up.
