<p>TUESDAY, JANUARY 28, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine but very cold. Round</p>
<p>town all the day. Had lunch</p>
<p>up at the Bank with Kieth and</p>
<p>Barry. Barry &amp; a couple of mates</p>
<p>went to &quot;Us&quot; at night, but said</p>
<p>it was a pretty bum show. Kieth</p>
<p>&amp; I went home. As we were both</p>
<p>very tired.</p>
