 Dull & showery. The usual love making performances by aeroplane this morning. Run to "K" Supply Column & A.D.M.S. Office 5th Div. Hd. Q. Scottish Lines Busseboom. Joy ride, notwithstanding the bad roads, to Proven in search of Will Lindsay.  I passed a huge aerodrome & watched the numerous planes preparing for flight.  27 in all flew up as I was looking on - One dashed to the ground before rising to a height  off the gr .  The Plane was damaged but the pilot escaped.  Went to the "Duds" Pierrot Show in Poperinghe - a really fine affair. Saw Bill Bailey.
