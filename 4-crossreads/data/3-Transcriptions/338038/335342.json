<p>to &ndash; I am just writing this sitting up in my bunk at 7 am. We are in tents back here, &amp; find the life above ground agrees with one ever so much more than a dug out existence. Weather the last few days has been beautifully warm &amp; fine, almost like Australian spring days.<br/>Letters from Exeter this last few weeks have been ever so much more cheerful &ndash; They had been to Bournemouth for Easter which seemed to buck them up considerably.</p>
<p>Anzac day here was only sufficient to stir up mild enthusiasm among the<br/>[indecipherable] days here. Some of the Regiments of in rest held sports etc. but we gave it a bye. The thing is inclined to be overdone anyhow.</p>
