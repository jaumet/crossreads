<p><u>June 28th</u></p>
<p>The study of new items - Heavy seas cause the boat to roll more than what personal comfort calls for.&nbsp; During the day we ship many waves and the boys fight shy of the low open decks.</p>
<p>Washing day, but soon &#39;twill be no more!</p>

<p>&quot;Old clothes, new clothes, bought</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; or souvenired clothes,</p>
<p>We have washed them clean</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; and washed them dirty,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; too, at times,</p>
