1915 Monday December 13One man got a scratch last night but we got up about 150 yards of Barb wire - At some points the Turks have thrown out grappling irons & dragged the Barb wire in, at one post they sent back a message rolled around a stone that "15ft lengths would be easier to handle"Some humourists evidently - I could tell you much to interest you tonight but I dare not - However its a 1000 to 1 we will not spend our Xmas Dinner on the Peninsular. No more Mails outwards or inwards for the present.
