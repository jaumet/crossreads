turned into a Hospital &ndash; The Palace is fine place &amp; holds I think about 1000 beds &ndash; Have hardly got the swing of their money yet &ndash; Went into Cairo in the evening &ndash; suffice to say Kitchener said it took him 20 years to make Cairo &amp; the Australians have undone it in 20 minutes. I am sadly afraid when next lot of Tourists visit Egypt they will be more than shocked at the Nigs Language.

Quite cold all day &ndash; About 100 A.M.C. men sent at 5.30am this morning for some unknown destination, all the Field Ambulance men who came on Wondilla were sent away. During the day there was a call for Volunteers to go somewhere unknown. I volunteered but was promptly turned down &amp; told there was no hope of any L.H.F.A. getting away &ndash; mostly L.H.F.A. in Camp here now &ndash; Don't know why they are retaining all L.H.F.A.
