<p>Corps visited the front line and shaking hands with the flank man, spoke of his unique position as the right Flank man of the British army.&nbsp; All that day the &quot;digger&quot; was worried by his pals coming up with extended hand, and congratulating him on being &quot;Right hand man of the Right Section of the Right Platoon of the Right Company&quot; and so on &quot;ad nauseum&quot; until properly exasperated he isolated himself and beat off his well-wishers/with showers of clods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I could tell more but that might be telling secrets, anyhow both French and Aussies have the liveliest appreciation of each other&#39;s qualities and the &quot;Entente&quot; could often be observed being cemented by the/exchange of Aussie cigarettes and French issue Wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All/good wishes, from</p>
