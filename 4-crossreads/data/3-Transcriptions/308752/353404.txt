<p>6th Edition<br/>1st January 1917.<br/>New Years Day, &amp; a bitterly cold one too, a great difference to that of last year, which we spent in the oppressive heat of Egypt. Of course a holiday was granted to all. Eric, Bob &amp; I went for a long walk it was enjoyable in spite of the severe cold, the country was looking very fine, the fields looking beautifully fresh &amp; green.</p>
<p>A number of members of the unit have been very busy during the past week arranging a Concert for New Years Night. They call themselves the "Night Birds Pierrot Concert Party". Naturally every one expected something good &amp; I can assure you that the show turned out a great success, &amp; considering the short time that the concert was arranged the artists deserve much praise. Eric &amp; Bob were amongst the performers.</p>
<p>For the next fortnight the same old routine took place each day, fatigues, drill etc &ndash; &amp; the weather was a perisher too.</p>
<p>14th January.</p>
<p>After having a well earned rest the Bearers again were off, to do some work in the Trenches.</p>
