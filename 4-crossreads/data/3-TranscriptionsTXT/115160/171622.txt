 you have not yet acknowledged to me the receipt of the package that I have sent to you. &nbsp;Have you had it? 
 I&nbsp;have passed at Calence good vacation. &nbsp;During my sojourn there, I have been at Areachon (I have thought of you&nbsp;I have bought postcards, and when you shall come at Paris on leave, I shall give them to you.) 
 I owe the sum of F5 to you. &nbsp;What due&nbsp;of it? 
 I expect your letter with patience. 
 I trust you in good health, 
 Yours faithfully
