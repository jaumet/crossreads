4/1/16Reaching Sardi pier we sat down there and lunched. Gang of Egyptians were stamping upon metal with wooden stampers. Formed in two rows and led by a tall fellow who chanted a snatch of a chanty they all lowered their stampers as they replied in chorus. I noticed their chorus was always the same, the leader varied his words though and accompanied it with gesture. A lazy loafing crowd, they kept quarrelling among themselves and the overseers had frequently to sail in with blows.
At 1400 we went aboard the Waterwitch and went across harbour passing a submarine en route. Came alongside the Blue funnel 10000 tonner Ascanius and got all the boys aboard. Duggan Ships Adjutant. With Major Smith in a fine cabin. Destination Egypt probably via Canal disembarking at Ismailia. Dinner very elaborate after Ulysses style and the first off a table with a cloth on for some time.
Crozier has drawn a good picture called the Furphey depicting two trench soldiers meeting in Shrapnel Valley and exchanging supplies. The men are fairly comfortable in the troop decks and at present are indulging in singing with piano accompaniment. We have here BdeHQ 19, 20, 21 & 22 Bns & 6 Field Am here - we are anchored in Mudros Bay and sail tomorrow morning. Had a hot bath & once more experienced the delight of sleeping on a spring mattress & between sweet white sheets.
