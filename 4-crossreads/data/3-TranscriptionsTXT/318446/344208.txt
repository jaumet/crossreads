Same night 9.45 p.m.Three taubes have just been over & dropped about 15 bombs.  The first night raid we have yet had & I devoutly hope that it may be the last.  I had to turn out in pyjamas & stand out with Bernard in the bitter cold for about half an hour.  There is a full moon so while we could not see him he could probably see us against the white sand.  It was miserable.
8 a.m., Jan. 9th 1914Outside RafaI was wrong;  there are no infantry here, only five brigades of Cavalry & two batteries of guns, which guns have just started in.This is to be a raid, even if we take the place we shall not hold it, but return on the 10th.Two prisoners already captured declare that the numbers are 2000 turks, 40 germans & M.Gs.
