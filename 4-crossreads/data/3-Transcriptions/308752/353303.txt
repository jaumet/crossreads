<p>to show our appreciation of these worthy gentlemen. Our promenade deck was gaily decorated for the occasion &amp; every member of the 8th had to contribute an item, musical or otherwise. Some of the former inflicted on us were to funny for words. I acted as accompanist as usual, altogether we had an extremely amusing &amp; a most enjoyable evening. My item was a hit, arrayed as a Matron, my entrance was the signal for an outburst of laughing.  I also carried Fushia (our Mascot) in my arms, I then gave my experiences in Liverpool &amp; then I <u>sang</u> (now don't laugh). The Little Grey Home in the West.  Broke my G string in the attempt.</p>
<p>At midnight I think the 8th suddenly went mad there was a terrific fusillade of loaves of bread, books, &amp; hammocks flying in all directions, it was an exciting half hour, eventually we settled down to sleep, but alas, to wake in the morning tired out &amp; with sore heads.</p>
<p>Tuesday 7th December.<br/>Orders have come out that every man must have both kit bags ready, so that there will be no delay in disembarkation. Great excitement prevails as every one knows that we are approaching our landing place. We have now only to travel 220 miles.</p>
<p>Wednesday December 8th.</p>
