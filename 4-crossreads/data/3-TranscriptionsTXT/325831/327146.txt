 I have not heard from Keith since he went across but of course judging by past experience, I did not expect to. I took a great liking to Ken, whom you mentioned in one of your letters. He had the good luck to be hit through the arm before reaching the front line. I am sending some photographs (of myself) home. One will be sent along to you when they arrive. I think they are very good &amp; hope you will like them. Best Love to Mrs Ferguson &amp; Dorothy 
 Affectionately yours C.R. Lucas
