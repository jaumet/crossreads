the book but it was not to be found in all Cambridge, so have just copied out a few of them that struck as particularly fine though perhaps a little crude. I thought that perhaps the Editress of "The Budget" might find room for one in the next issue. I received No 3 from Wally whilst in France and passed it on to Harry Vandy Geoff Woodriff and afterwards Lt Gritten. I left France just afterwards. I don't know whether you have heard but poor old Van is missing or so Harry told me in his last letter. Poor old boy, he was such a fine chap. God rest his soul if he has passed to the great Beyond.
Please give my love to the Mater
