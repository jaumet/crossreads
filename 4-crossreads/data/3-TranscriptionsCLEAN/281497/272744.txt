  
 25th.   This morning we all had 5 minutes each with the squad & drilled them as we liked for that time, that took up over 2 hours so we had a fair length of time at drill, after we finished we went & had a swim in the mouth of the "Somme" there is a pretty stiff current running in her, but the water was lovely & we enjoyed ourselves. 
 They are a fine lot of chaps with the exception of 1 or 2 who are inclined to be conceited & know all, they will learn a severe lesson I'll bet before it is over they will come what the boys call a "gutser"
