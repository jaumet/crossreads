<p>a halfpenny. My next call was the Cathedral on the water front &amp; I found it rather a splendid one. Constructed on the plans of St Sophia at Constantinople, it is not yet finished but is really magnificent as it is. Beautiful mosaic work is everywhere. Marble of different countries abounds, several windows being of transparent marble in place of glass. The architecture is Byzantine. A small church alongside dates from the 11th Century. Returned to hotel, collected my baggage &amp; after a cup of coffee went to the Station. Could not book a seat so had to stand &amp; had rather a rough trip to Paris, feeling the cold very keenly. Had dinner on the train, very good, 11 Francs.<br/>14th Nov. Thursday<br/> Arrived in Paris at midday and felt it cold after Nice. Had lunch at Duvals near the Gare de Lyon then went back to the Hotel Astra &amp;</p>
