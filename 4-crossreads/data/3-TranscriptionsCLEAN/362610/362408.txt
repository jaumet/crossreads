  
 Tuesday 11 July 1916 A very pleasant night & I got a very fair sleep missing most of the scenery. At 6 o'clock started to take an interest in things & found that we were passing thro' fairly undulating country in which the cultivated fields alternated with wooded uplands. The poppies & field flowers looked very bright & gay. Passed through Doullens & about 7 detrained at Feinvilliers-Chandas, & after waiting for the transportn. to be ready, started to move out thro' the township & past fields most gaily coloured with poppies, cornflowers, mustard, "pin-cushions" &c. Crops of crimson clover were quite common & looked splendid. The undulating country thro' which the road passed was a change to the extremely level plains we had become accustomed to further north, & some very pretty peeps of villages nesting in hollows with hills sloping down to them on all sides, or in a densely wooded valley along which a little stream found its way were had. Stopped at 9 for breakfast, & soon after midday reached our destination, Domart. The billets were very poor & took a lot of fixing up for the men : we were fairly comfortable, & in the afternoon I had a lovely bath in a washbasin. Turned in early & had a great sleep. Leo came in for a few minutes as we were about to have tea. Nelson Slee joined up.
