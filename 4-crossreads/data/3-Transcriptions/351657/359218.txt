<p>amazing.  Have seen no gardens up to ours yet but of course I have only seen the public ones at Cairo.  They have nice lawns &amp; trees but not the wealth of bloom I expected.  I am trying to get the seed of a tree in the grounds here.  It is very like a Jackeranda [Jacaranda] in foliage but has a lovely spray of red blooms with [indecipherable] shaped flowers.  If I hear the name I will jot it down &amp; may procure it somewhere else.  We are very well looked after here.  Plenty of sports such as rowing, bathing, walking, donkey riding etc., &amp; the evenings are filled in with concerts &amp; picture shows.  Have seen or heard nothing of Duncan or Alison Walker.</p>
<p>Love to you both,<br/>Yours truly<br/>James Ayre</p>
