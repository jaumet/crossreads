<p>Fine but fairly cold. The 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Bat &amp; our infantry battalion had a sham fight with the 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Bat &amp; their infantry. We had to fight a rear guard action &amp; we won the day. I was wheel driver in the firing battery waggon &amp; had a real good day, &amp; we did very well I think. Poss &amp; I went down to 28 Camp &amp; I took Syd Lyddel&#39;s place on horse picket when I came back as the poor kid was pretty sick.</p>
