  
 The observation baloons are also advancing almost every day now. We packed up and left Bray camp about 11. a.m. and travelled East passing many enemy shell dumps on the way and one dead German. Then we passed through Suzanne village which is only slightly damaged by shells & that only recently. When the Germans were driven out they shelled the village. We halted on the outskirts of the town behind a chalk bank and started to make dug outs to sleep in. After dinner we got word that the army had gone through Peronne - and that we were to move forward to keep 
 in touch with our battalion. At 4 this afternoon we continued on our journey from Suzanne camp and ascended a high ridge which forms one of the numerous bends of the Somme. It was with difficulty we got up and several teams got stuck & had to be assisted. We crossed over the ridge and descended its high precipitous banks by a zig zag road and followed the bend of the Somme at the foot of the ridge until we came to Curlu where we halted. On the road we passed several dead Germans on the side of the road
