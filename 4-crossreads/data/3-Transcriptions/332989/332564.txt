<p>At Sea</p>
<p>My Dearest Mother<br/>Hope you received my wires O.K. before leaving.   We had a very busy time during the week before embarkation.   There were four of us missed in our examination at the Officers School &amp; we are all together in the one Company and rather pleased at having missed, as if we had passed it would have mean't another few months in Camp at W.A. drilling recruits.   We've had an excellent trip right throughout &amp; very little sickness, as usual the sea did not bother me at all except to increase my appetite to such an extent that I am always hungry &amp; ready for my meals.   Will start another long diary letter like I wrote from Africa &amp; send you shorter notes in between.    We had splendidly cool weather crossing the equator, in fact have not had any warm weather to speak of at all.   You can send me the Knitted things as soon as</p>
