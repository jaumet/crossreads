<p>Saturday 15 April 1916<br/>A dull grey day, cold in the wind. A full parade on the Training Ground was held in the morning but after we had been there a short time several of our companies were sent back because the heads were not ready for us. Reached camp just in time to escape a heavy storm during which some very light snow fell.<br/>Until 3 in the afternoon busy at the fence, erecting marquee &amp; similar work, &amp; then with 3 other officers walked round the beach to Etaples where, after &frac12; hrs wait we caught the narrow gauge electric train out to Paris-Plage, a fashionable little watering place on the Channel, the train line taking us through a "forest" nearly all the way. Saw the "Socotra" in the process of being salved on the beach, the bow being quite apart from the remainder.<br/>Looked round the promenade, fashionable but deserted houses, bathing machines now idle, &amp; streets full of officers, then had tea of ham &amp; eggs, another walk round &amp; train back, reaching camp abt. 9 o'clock in the moonlight.</p>
