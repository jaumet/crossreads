 Saturday 17th The sun rose about 3 and we woke up and gaze on the land we were leav . It was look real well too . All the land around was under cultiv and the crop were look well . The nativ get to work earli . They were busi gather their crop and take them to market , load on camel and donkey . The girl and women were kept busi draw water . We saw some fine look girl trip along with water jar on their head . The Arab on these out farm are much superior to the crowd that hang around our camp . We arriv in Alexandria at about 5 a.m. The nativ met us with chocol and cigarett , as usual , and a new stunt they had chang money , which must have been a god thing for them . We went aboard the " Transylvania " at about 9 . She is a fine big boat , but has a veri bad name among the troop as a " starvat ship " There are about 3,000 of us aboard . And there is not too much room . We are all issu with Life Belt which have to be worn all day and slept in at night . Tea was the first meal we had aboard . It consist of bread and butter . Not veri "scrumptious " but a pleasant chang from Bulli Beef and Biscuit , and tea to drink . It was so hot and stuffi down below that we was allow to put our blanket on the promenad deck . Last post was blown at 7.30 and "light out " at 8. No smoke after tea is the hardest part . But , of cours it better to do without a smoke than strike a match and attract a bloomin ? hun submarin . Alexandria is a fine town , what we saw of it . The Harbor is full of ship of all kind . There are score of yacht and littl boat fli round . It put one in mind of dear old Sydney . We soon got to sleep as we were tire out after our train journey .
