<p>[Transcriber's note:<br/>In this diary Frank Weir is a member of the First Light Horse Division in North Africa after having been on the Anzac Peninsula. His diary entries for 1918 are regularly cut out and sent to his mother as in his previous diaries, hence the tape on each page which obscures some of the text. At some later date the diaries have been over-written, sometimes incorrectly, by some person unknown.]</p>
