 Sunday 9 September 1917 
 Cairo Waiting &amp; Hoping. The Turkshave a proverb viz, "Power over the Water hath ALLAH given to the intercessor but  over the land  to the faithful" &ndash; strange people. I lost my book altho' I turned the Hotel servants upside down for it &ndash; "They only said it was the "Will of ALLAH". Went to Church with Nowell. Later on to a Carnival of Flowers &amp; Confetti in some Gardens here a Fete for the French. 
 We also had our "caricatures" done for 40 P.T. I am posting you mine in a TIN TUBE &amp; hope it arrives safely.
