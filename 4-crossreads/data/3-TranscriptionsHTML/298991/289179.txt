<p>Wednesday June 13th<br/>The weather is getting much warmer now, a perspiration can be easily raised. There <strike>are</strike> is plenty of physical <strike>drill</strike> drill &amp; drill here. There must be fully a brigade of men here altogether. On Infantry drill nearly all day, it is the first drill of the kind I have done for about eighteen months, so I proved very awkward anyhow there were plenty more besides me "in the same boat". Some of the fellows are sent over to France from this camp. I am expecting to go to Parkhouse Camp on Monday. The food isn't bad here, but not enough.</p>
<p>Thursday June 14th<br/>It is very dusty camping in the tents, everything get very dirty in no time, &amp; you feel just as dirty five minutes after you have a wash. There are plenty of officers here. By going on the medical inspection this morning I missed a whole day route march, &amp; this <strike>evening</strike> afternoon we went out &amp; laid down all the time so we have had a very easy day. The O.C. here is an artist, he is a bit off his head (general opinion), but very good to the men, he comes out with some very comical sayings.</p>
<p>There was a big draft left for France this morning. The light horse is expecting to leave for Egypt any day now. I wish I was going with them. Every one in camp seems to be broke, it is a common occurrence, now one very seldom has any money a couple of days after pay day, especially now as the prices of everything is very dear, &amp; the two principal items (cigarettes &amp; beer) have gone up tremendously.</p>
