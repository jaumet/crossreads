The last couple of days we had a list posted up in our mess room & for every time one of us swears in the mess room it is pencilled up & every swear costs a penny, I have two to my name already, but I am not the only one who is going strong, it is a good idea for it keeps bad language down. This afternoon we were out manouvering & attacking certain positions which were in the plan, we walked & ran
