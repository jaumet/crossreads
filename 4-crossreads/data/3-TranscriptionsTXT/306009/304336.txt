 1915 May. 30 Sun. Got one of the English Scouts, who speaks 4 or 5 languages to give me my first real lesson in Arabic this afternoon. I intend to go in strongly for Arabic &amp; French both of which are extremely useful. After tea went to the Kursal (variety theatre) &amp; saw a very good programme although the songs were in French. Then visited the Soldiers Club near Esbekieh Gardens where we had a hot dinner about 9 p.m. Number of patients now in Hospital &ndash; 476
