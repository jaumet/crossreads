29th  This morning when I went on I was so sorry to find that Captain Lloyd has come in as a patient & am afraid its typhoid - poor boy he is finding it hard to submit to the inevitable.  He was so very keen on keeping well - He was to be a Major in a short time - fancy & only 24.  Three mornings ago we saw the 1st Brigade starting on its way back to Anzac apparently cheerful & brave - though at heart we all knew how they hated the thought of going back to the memories there - it made me feel terribly sad.  The reinforcements for the 4th are quarantined on account of mumps & measles.  I wonder why this Island is so unhealthy - though I don't suppose it's the island so much as the flies & the want of suitable food.  It's truly heart breaking when we have serious cases.
31st  I am wishing myself a happy Birthday.  A friend is going to post this in England for me - so farewell again you dear old things out there.  With loving Greetings for Xmas, I shall think of you all so far away XXXX.  A special Xmas X.  This is all I can send.A Donnell(PS:  I sent this [indecipherable] going from Eng - but truly I'm a bit scared of the Arrogan).
