<p>May 1915<br/>Friday 28<br/>Fine. Our fatigue carrying water for the company. The Turks shelled us with 9.2 in shells and did no harm as usual. Our guns doing a bit for their living again, the enemy replying. We pelt bombs &amp; flares of all sorts at one another of a night time. More reinforcements have reached us</p>
