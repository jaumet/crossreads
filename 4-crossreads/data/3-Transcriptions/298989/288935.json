<p>5/1/16<br/>Bathed at 0630. Round Troop decks where all were rather mixed and a lot of people like lost sheep not knowing where to go. Fell in on well deck aft at 0700 and checked lifebelts. After breakfast all fell in with rifles and lifebelts at boat stations. Carried on cleaning rifles inspecting &amp; so on. Went round with O.C. Troops on inspection of troop decks. All troops cleared out from below between the hours of 9 to 11, 2 to 4, only mess orderlies and troop deck sergts being below then. The gear all supposed to be stacked in the racks overhead but owing to lack of accommodation was in heaps in some places. The men all told off into messes and all sit at their tables for meals using their own mess traps swabbing and scrubbing all done before 1100.</p>
<p>Aft on the troop deck is a 4.7 gun with gunner we told off a crew of 6 to assist. Lt Col Mackenzie wanted to know why the gun was trained to starboard! Machine guns also mounted at different posts and men on the gun continually. Two sentries with fixed bayonets and two men for lowering purposes are on duty constantly at each boat and everyone carries lifebelts all the time. The ship do the cooking at galleys fore and aft.</p>
<p>A fair sea on this morning and some men sick. Mitchell is in the hospital and not to well. Last night someone ran into us and knocked the boat on the port davits of poop deck to pieces. Latest furphey is we disembark at Alexandria not Ismailia. Passing small islands all bare and green. Col Gwynne &amp; Major Bruggy are on board. Fell into boat stations during afternoon. Wrote &amp; read before tea and turned in at 1000. Boat rolling &amp; was a bit sick.</p>
