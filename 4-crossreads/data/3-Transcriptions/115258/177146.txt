This avenue stretched right to Luxor once, I believe, but only a few now remain. They are statues of a lions body with a rams head, although most of them have had their heads cut off and sent to different museums, but the it was wonderful to see the expression and intelegence in the faces that do remain, I&#39;ll bet the sculptor who made them, had had to mind a mob of roughish crossbreds when he was a little nipper back home on the farm. He knew all about the character of different sheep alright.</p>
