<p>1 January 1916 Sat<br/>With Ken Price &amp; Arthur Preston paid a visit to the village of Portianos.</p>
<p>All Happy &amp; contented as we lay in the tent &ndash; clasping each others hands to the strains of Auld Lang Syne during the outgoing &amp; incoming of the New Year. Great noise from the syrens &amp; whistles of the boats lying in the bay, amidst thousands of troops, cheering &amp; several rockets being sent up. Ones thoughts were in Enmore of such times of the past.</p>
<p>2.1.16<br/>Church &ndash; parade. Awfully cold &amp; terribly windy consequently could not hear one word of the chaplains [perinon]. Went to see Jim, Frank, &amp; Ronny induling in a glass of whisky with John [indecipherable].</p>
