1916NovemberShortly after leaving the Bight some bright spark got playing with the log register and altered it a few hundred miles.  As the weather was dull, the captain was relying to some extent on the log.  When the sun did shine it was discovered that we were some hundreds of miles out of our course.   No one was allowed to go near it after that.We had sports about a fortnight out.   Our tug-o-war team was champion of the boat.  This was mainly owing to their training by Lieut Smith who had been at the game before and knew all the tricks.  Our opponents nearly won at one stage by sheer weight - six more inches and we would have lost.   Each of our ten men got a prize.   We also had cockfighting, potato races and other deck sports.   I took several photos, but almost without exception, they were failures.  [Inserted photo titled "Cockfighting".]Dec 5.   On 5th December awoke to
