Pay small but regular &ndash; bracing out-door life (especially in the winter spring and autumn) &ndash; constant employment guaranteed (7 days per week) &ndash; liberal holidays (after the war) &ndash; all home comforts of French farmhouses, except heating lighting, baths, and sanitary appliances. What offers?</p>
