<p>60 cases of Tucker to keep Fit Men FIT, were distributed today.  Tinned Fruit Pickles &amp; all those things a School boy likes , we are only a bit overgrown<br/>We have to thank those good women who went thro' the ordeal of the Queen business I suppose for swelling the funds to send this stuff along.<br/>Boxing Competition last night but too hot, anything to change the men's thoughts from Stand to Arms etc etc.<br/>A dozen mouth organs &amp; a concertina or two would amuse them.<br/>You would be surprised on a moonlight night to hear the Music that is knocked out as the men Ride along when "all clear" &amp; going back to Camp</p>
