<p>into insignificance.  The Editor of the A.M.G. has not thought to send to me copies of the paper.  Still sick but hoping to be better.  We shall soon be away from here then I may be right.</p>
<p>Your letter is like all from home, a hurried composition run off at the last moment in hopes to catch a supposed post (that you have read of or heard about from some one who has taken more interest than you in the mails.  I hope You, or Car, or Kitty has remembered to have read in my earlier letters that the best way to write a letter, is to do a little each day, &amp; when events have been set out in sufficient number to put their narrative in an envelope, drop this into the post sufficiently addressed, the postal authorities will do the rest.  Remember how they delivered letters from Buddie to me here in 28 days on two occasions!</p>
<p>The moon is at the full in the Northern Hemisphere, rising from the Eastern sky, it is now 10-45 p.m. high in the heavens, and seen through my window, from where I sit, is as a ringed flat surface of variegated pale blue, the size of five shilling piece, shedding clear unwarmed rays upon the pyradmids and all the land of Egypt, round about these parts.</p>

<p>May heaven from its endless goodness send to each of you, prosperous life, long, and ever happy.  With kisses each take my blessing, and love that flows to you, from</p>
<p>Your loving &amp; affectionate father<br/>John B. Nash</p>
