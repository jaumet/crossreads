 My dear father 
 The parcels came to hand safely I got them to day, I expect you all had a hand in the watch, thanks very much, it will be very handy. also please thank mother for sox they are the real thing at last & should stand any amount of marching. not that we do much here, things are rather slack, owing to riots in Melbourne. our weekly leave has been cut down 6 hours, giving us only 6 hours to enjoy ourselves in this act has cause quite a stir of indignation in the camp but its no use the lads kicking as the order came from the C.C. a very high authority on such matters. The rein for the 13th Batt which recently arrived from Liverpool are out on strike. some mistake occurred, & their pay is now 10 days overdue. I can't blame them for feeling narked. no money, tobacco or cigarettes, the very last straw as far as soldiering is concerned. 
 We had a sort of sham fight this morning which I think was a farce, we had a good time enjoyed the change from the parade ground to the paddocks but learnt nothing & did very little. I hope things will be different when we arrive in Egypt or where ever we are going, otherwise we will get wiped out in
