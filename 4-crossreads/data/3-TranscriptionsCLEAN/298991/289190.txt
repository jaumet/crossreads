  
 Sunday July 15th Con 
 two of the lads knocked out with bricks, & about ten minor injuries. It was very exciting for about two hrs. 
 Monday July 16th The lad that they couldn't arrest last night, was duly arrested off the early morning parade this morning. He admits he is an out law, & gave is career as such, viz 18 months in Darlinghurst, Sydney. 6 months in Long Bay. 6 weeks in Abbasia (Australian Military gaol) & 8 weeks in a gaol at Isle of Wight, & I suppose he will receive a big term for this. The Corporal M.P. was seriously wounded, & as the mob says, served him right, as he was a rotter of the first class. 
 Tuesday July 17th I do very little work in the store now, as we are packing up a large lot of old unserviceable clothing & equipment to go back to ordnance, it is a rotten job too, as some of the old clothes would nearly "stand up & bark at you". You have to keep smoking to keep the smell down at times. Everything is very quiet after the riot. Rained during the day.
