Friday 30 August
A dinner to-night in the church at Morcourt which was a tremendous success with a 1st Battn. band in attendance the distribution of the prizes won yesterday. It is absolutely the best unit dinner in history. In responding to a eulogy "Bib" said "that we had a good dinner to-night ?cos the rations came from the canteen regimental funds but to-morrow when I get the rations from the Q.M. stores I will be a b?". Very funny indeed.
Rumour of a great attack in the south by American troops others in two days time.
