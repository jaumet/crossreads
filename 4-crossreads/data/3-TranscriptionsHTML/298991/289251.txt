<p>(1) Jacka Lula Hickey Dula</p>
<p>Down Hawaii way, where I chanced to stay<br/>On an ev'ning I heard a Hula maiden play<br/>Jacka hula hickey dula du<br/>Down Hawaii way by the moon-light Bay<br/>When I lingered a while, she then stole my heart away.</p>
<p>Yack hula hickey dula du<br/>Oh! I don't care if you loved the ladies far &amp; near<br/>You'd forget about them all if you could hear<br/>Jack hula hickey dula du.</p>
<p><u>Chorus</u><br/>I'm coming back to you my hula Lou<br/>besides the sea at Waikiki you'l play for me<br/>&amp; once again you'll sway my heart your way<br/>With your jack hula hickey dula tune.</p>
<p>2<br/>Down Hawaii you would love to stay<br/>if you'd ever see how those Hula's bend &amp; sway<br/>Jack hula hickey dula du<br/>Down Hawaii while the breakers play<br/>with a movement just like the wave those Hula's Say</p>
