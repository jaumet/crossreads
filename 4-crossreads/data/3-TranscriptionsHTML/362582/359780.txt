Poor old Fred is having a very cold time, wish they could come here for the winter. All the sisters received a Xmas box from Victoria. There was great excitement amongst us all, opening our boxes. I was a lucky one, matron had a few extra parcels (not boxes), so had a dip in the lucky bag &amp; I picked a number, so got a few extra little useful articles &ndash; My box contained a pair of red slippers, a hair pins, pins, tin of biscuits, tin of short bread, tin of chocolates, post cards, 2 handkerchiefs, 1 cake of soap, 1 small bottle of Eau-de-Cologne, tooth brush, lanoline &amp; tooth paste also a pretty little Red-enamel cross; all contained much the same. It is very kind thought of the Victorians &amp; we all quite appreciate their goodness. All these little acts of kindness makes it a bit like Xmas time.</p>
