that I had arrived & they came back immediately. It was rather funny when the Eldest girl shook hands she forgot what to say, not having had practice at English for 3 years. We had a long talk, Sonia the eldest girl, improving in English as we proceeded & I arranged to meet the two girls in the Rue de Medecin at 3.30 the next day. Went home to the Hotel by tube the girls showing me the station & my friend arrived at the same time having gone to a theatre. Had a night cap & turned in well pleased with the day. Altho' Paris was comparatively dead & autumn had reduced all foliage to falling leaves, it was yet a great sight to us & we could well imagine what it is like in the proper season.
November 5th  We were called at 7 o'clock, bath shave & breakfast etc then by the aid of a guide book set off to do the city until 3.30. Starting from the Rue de l'opera, a street of splendid shops. We proceeded down Rue St.Roch to the Church of St Roch, a large plain church & the Place of Roch, the scene of a scrap of Napoleon & the Royalists 1795. We then passed a statue of Jeanne d'arc in the Rue de Rivoli, Rue des Tuleries
