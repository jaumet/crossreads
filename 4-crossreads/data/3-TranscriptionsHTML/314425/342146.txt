<p>The advance here is held up owing to the stoppage on our left. At the foot of this gully and at the approach is the lagoon there is a village which is not very much damaged but the one we passed through yesterday was a heap of bricks, mortar and rafters. Ruined beyond repair. The streets are blotted out and the ruins are indescriable.<br/>For the first time today I could see our own shells bursting on the enemies positions.<br/>A terrific barage opened up on our left where the enemy was holding out in a wood &amp; the Tommies could not take it yesterday and consequently held us up. Nothing could live through the shelling and it was not very long before the wood was taken &amp; the enemy retreating.<br/>Our position is a very dangerous one, and we should not be in it - the enemy has direct observation from two baloons, it is the site of his batteries and now our 18 pounders &amp; 4.5 are in position.<br/>This afternoon he is shelling the wood alongside us. Finally he put shells in the gully &amp; we got orders to take them out. Several shells lobed among the limbers &amp; one between the shafts of the mess cart as we were removing</p>
