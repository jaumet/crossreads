<p>Some very effective work has recently been carried out by the Navy and the R.N.A.S., against points of importance on the Turko-Bulgarian communications and the concentration areas of Uzun Keupru, etc.  Effective bombardments have been made by naval guns of railway bridges and junctions at Bodoma, Dedeagatch, the important road-bridge at Kavak, and the very important supply depot at Gallipoli.  On the last occasion four direct hits in succession were obtained on the flour mills at Gallipoli at a range of 19,800 yards.  Turkish columns and convoys moving near the coast have been harried, numerous casualties have been caused and traffic by certain roads made impossible during daylight.</p>
<p>Our aircraft have carried out some brilliant reconnaissances combined with bomb attacks on roads, bridges and concentrations.  Besides effectively spotting the ship's guns on to the targets mentioned above, they have attacked among others the following important points, the junction at Ferejik, the railway bridge at Kuleli Burgas (repeatedly damaged by heavy bombs), camps and marching columns in the Kavak-Keshan-Uzun Keupru-Adrianople area.  Severe casualties have been caused by dropping 20 and 100 lb. bombs among troops in camp.  On some occasions our airmen have first ascertained that camps were occupied by dropping hand grenades among the tents, and then, on a rush being made by the Turks to cover in adjutant gullies, they have dropped 100 lb. bombs amongst them with devastating effect.  Last night a particularly brilliant night flight was made of 4&frac12; hours' duration, 100 lb. bombs were dropped from a height of only 400 feet on the railway bridge at Kuleli Burgas, cutting the line, and a valuable reconnaissance of Turkish camps was made right up to Adrianople.  This flight is certainly one of the longest night operations yet undertaken by aircraft in the war, and possibly constitutes a record.</p>
