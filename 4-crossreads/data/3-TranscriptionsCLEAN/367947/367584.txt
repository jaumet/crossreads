My dear botherTomorrow we embark for the Dardanelles. We go dismounted so you can bet its going to be pretty rough for a while. Horses may follow later. We are now clothed with putties & other infantry gear.
Well old man I hope I come through lucky. It is a big thing to go for & for Lizzie's sake I am very sorry. However it is too late to draw back now so will do my bit cheerful. Should anything happen I ask you & all to keep a kindly eye on the poor little girlie & the boy. She is a wonderful good little girl & you know what I have been to her.
I am very sorry Jack that I have caused you so much grief & worry through life. It was just my nature I suppose. However should I get through O.K. will be starting life on a great deal better footing
