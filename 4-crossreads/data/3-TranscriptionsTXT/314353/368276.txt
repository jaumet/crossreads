 156.  December 1 Last night a full reading of Twinkletoes&hellip; Its real title "A Tale of Chinatown".  Morrison's "Child of the Jago" and Frank Danby's 'Heart of a Child' years ago used almost the same framework, on which Burke has hung his "Tale of Chinatown"&hellip; but for its wonder of phrase, its sordid realism made even beautiful, and its fine drawing, Twinkletoes is the masterpiece of the three&hellip; The drawing of Chuck &ndash; the ex-pugilist full of worshiping love for Twinkletoes, and her fierce protector, is the finest thing in the book&hellip; a drawing fully abounding in fine phrases, of wounderfully [indecipherable] lights, and rich backgrounding.
