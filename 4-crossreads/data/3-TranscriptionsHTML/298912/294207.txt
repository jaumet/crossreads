This method of signalling is used where possible in preference to the other whenever it can be safely used to use the semaphore method one must be fully exposed. The other method is the morse &amp; can be used under cover &amp; consists of the waving of one flag representing the dots &amp; dashes of the morse code. This method is generally used although it is somewhat slower than semaphore. Here is a comparison between them<br/>SEMAPHORE.  Speed 12 words a minute requires the sender to be fully exposed. Only useful for short distance<br/>MORSE.   Speed 8 &ndash; 10 words a minute. Can be used by waving a flag above cover &amp; can be read at fairly long distances.<br/>The one other main instrument for signalling is the field telephone, This instrument is practically the only one used in the</p>
