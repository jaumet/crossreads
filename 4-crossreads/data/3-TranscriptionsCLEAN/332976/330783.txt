  
 January 1917 17th    My first day out of bed to-day.  I have been allowed only to stay in the ward as the weather has been very bad lately & is snowing now. 18th   I was shifted into another ward to-day and have been allowed full diet-(I have been on light diet since I have been in here consisting of milk & blanchmange & occasionaly a little bread)   It is still snowing & is now about 6" thick on the ground. 20th   I met S.M. Mason of the 1st Div. Supply Column & have been put on the list for a transfer into that unit.
