First news this morning is that 37 have been picked to go forward up the line. Tony & Bob omitted self chosen. Two former put in names to go. Staff Smith dies not want to let any of us go. Consents ultimately. We had a soft easy job on the wards & could retain it if desired, but we decided it was our duty to go forward. Rest of day taken up preparing for departure in morning.
