<p>Saturday 29 March 1919<br/>Crossed the line<br/>Issued free Mineral Water, Matches, Cigars &amp; tinned Fruit but one feels no pleasure in trying to make the trip pleasurable.<br/>Cold very bad &ndash; I think the fans were too strong in all the shops, hotels.  I want a spell in dry Riverina.<br/>Had difficulty in persuading Dolly not to buy another hat, it is a mania &amp; fancy choosing a hat in a hole &amp; corner place like Colombo!</p>
