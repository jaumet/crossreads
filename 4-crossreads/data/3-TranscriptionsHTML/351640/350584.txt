<p>returned if they so did wish.</p>
<p>My work here is almost ended, all my patients will be gone by tomorrow, then I may have a few days relaxation, which may, if I keep all right be devoted to sight seeing.  About midnight I became much improved and this morning 8.45 o'clock feel well.  I did not give in during the week but my body oft called upon one to cry enough.  With God's help, and it so please Him, I hope that 'twill be my fortune to see this business through and speak with you once again in Australia.</p>
<p>We are entering upon the serious phase of our business almost immediately, leaving here for some where nearer the fighting area midst the lands of Europe.  A Herculean contest 'twill truly be during the coming summer in this hemisphere, each party to the fight is bringing up its reinforcements to the best of its ability, they will be hurled against one another in such numbers and in so great weight as has not before been dreamed of on Old Earth.  Just think of it and shudder.  Yet, thank God, we shall not shirk the combat, nor from the General to the private show a piece of white feather in our host.  Doubtless German Bill &amp; his soldiers will strain ever [every] nerve with a mighty effort to beat the English and French armies and he may temporarily win, but we British must and shall come out triumphant in the end.  It was the seeing of this coming war and estimating its magnitude, that determined me, adown the years, to keep myself prepared to play a humble part in the struggle.</p>
<p>Goodbye now.  I must away.  To Mother M. Joseph &amp; your Colleagues the best of wishes for their blessings &amp; welfare.  Ask of them an occasional prayer for me.  To you my dear those &amp; heaps of love with loads of kisses.</p>
<p>Your aff Father<br/>John B. Nash</p>
