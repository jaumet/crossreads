<p>Nothing to break the ordinary run of routines.  The Sea has toned down &amp; we are gliding along at a good rate.<br/>We are still out of sight of land &amp; I understand we are just entering The Bight.  We have passed Adelaide without calling in.  Passed 2 Steamers en route.</p>
<p>Thursday 25th Nov 15<br/>Still out at Sea with no sight of Land.  We are still punching along in the Bight &amp; the roll is very big.  Sighted Whale this morning on Port Bow.  We expect to reach Albany on Saturday Afternoon.<br/> Nothing much of interest save that we passed very big liner on the Starboard Side, but could not make out who she was.</p>
<p>Friday 26/11/15<br/>Very heavy swell on, which makes one think that the boat will capsize at times.  Imagine Miles &amp; Miles of nothing but gigantic rolls &amp; you can get some idea of what it is like.<br/>We are now 300 miles out of Albany, but unfortunately Still in the Bight.  We hope to make Albany by 12 o'clock Saturday.  This is our fourth day without a sight of land.</p>
