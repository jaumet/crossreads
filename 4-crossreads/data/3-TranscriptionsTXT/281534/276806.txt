25/1/19 GourdinneMade an inspection of billets in the company of Adjutant Keith Sutherland and others. After lunch rode over to Haie Nallines [Nalinnes] with Gorman and there saw Jack and had a yarn with Major Pascoe. Returning found Stewart had arrived here on leave. At mess there was much chatter as H Smith and some others were lively. Afterwards went round with the Doctor to visit M. le Cure. He has a comfortable house and is a fine old chap. His nephew speaks good English. The Cure showed me a well hidden secret drawer in a sideboard where he hid a rifle during the War and also produced some old parish records dating back to 1600 and written in dog Latin and old French. Very interesting talking to the old chap and hearing his experiences. He gave me a copy of La Libre Belgique.
