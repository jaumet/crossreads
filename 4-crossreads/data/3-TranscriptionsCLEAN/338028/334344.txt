Sunday 6th AugWe attended a Tommy C. Parade in a.m., it is the first I have had opp of going to for months. We are still stationed at F.P.R.H. but should go out, before this, glorious news to hand. Near Ogrcitina [Oghratina] and Katia there has been heavy fighting and later we heard the glorious news that the 1st and 2nd L.H. Bdes were responsible for the capture of 3,000 Turks and a German machine gun section, we had 500 casualties which must effect us heavily.
I am proud and exultant about my old unit, I knew what they did 12 months to-night at Popes Hill and now they have achieved fame as Cavaltry. We are disappointed at not being in the thick of it but we have to hold an important post.
Monday 7th AugWe are off to-morrow to take up further outposts, just lolled about all day waiting for further news about our mates glorious win, the latest reports show that the casualties were chiefly amongst the Anzac M.A.D.[?] Div.
Prisoners keep pouring in, the latest a German M Gun section, a lot of the prisoners are poor Albanians whom the Turks have forced to march from Constantinople on foot. They had not tasted good water for three months. They have been seven months on the way. Col. Royston especially distinguished himself.
