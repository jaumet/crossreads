  
 After leaving Baubuerre the road is very heavy all the way to Bruay, I made a good run to Colon where the Branch line rejoins the Main line from St Pol to Chocques, my R.O.D. banker left me at Colon & a French Engine took its' place, & off we went again, as it was very dark I had to go along cautiously still climbing, we left the main line at [blank] & turned on to a Single line towards Houdain & on to Bruay, the line from Houdain to Bruay being very heavy, especially coming into Bruay Station, I was stopped half way into the Station by the Signal Man were my French Bank Engine left me & in a few moments was called ahead, but it was impossible to lift the load, & the French Men could not understand me & me them, so we all were in a quandery, anyhow as we had 15 trucks off for Bruay, they were uncoupled & put in the Siding. Then I lifted my load & after a good delay, off again we went  node  now
