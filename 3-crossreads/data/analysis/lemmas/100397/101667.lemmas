 17/8 /18 . Dear Mother Sinc last letter , Busi has been somewhat brisker than usual and , we have alter the shape of the front line again , and we also met our old friend again , the Prussian , They are not in the same street as the first lot though some of these joker were game to the last , but a veri big major were all readi to start on long distanc sprint , or to surrend I wish they were all like that , we would soon clear this countri . The Sammi we hear have done good work and I fanci that befor veri long fritz will want to discuss peac term again . If he insist on fight to a finish I think that we can easili meet him half way , and give him all the fight that he want , Jim Elder is camp quit close and is fair well . I have seen him a coupl of time late , I suppos you have heard that Eric is back on this side , he is with one of the M.G. Coy . and is full Corpor ? has a good safe job into the bargain
