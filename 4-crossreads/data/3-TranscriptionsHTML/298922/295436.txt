<p>OUTPOST HAGILI</p>
<p>On Outpost all last night again, night &amp; day is so mixed up. I am not sure of the date. Our horses have not been unsaddled since MONDAY &amp; of course none of us have even washed since then. <strike>We have not made a success of our attacks.</strike>  I went into a Bedouin Hut. The consequences have been catching FLEAS ever since 1000's of them. They do not bite so much as run about. Very dusty from Divisions moving about. <strike>Joe's</strike> glasses are most useful &amp; save my eyes a lot. This Agricultural Land is much dirtier &amp; cuts up more than the pure Desert Sand.</p>
