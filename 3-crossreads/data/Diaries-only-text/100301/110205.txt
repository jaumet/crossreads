We started from Sausage Gully with 180 N.C.O. men six officers 13 days after we came out 28 men one officer so we had our share of knocks also lost some fine officers men killed. our Captain was killed there on the firing step, just in the act of taking off his gas Helmet a shell burst a piece of shrapnel got him in the head he died soon after in a German first aid dressing station in a big dug out about 40 feet down in the ground which was fitted up with bunks to hold about 20 men it had been fitted up with Electric light but of course the lights were off.
Outside the dug-out in the open, there was a German field ambulance loaded up with men, two Horses driver another man on the seat in front, inside full up with men, all dead. A shell must have got the lot when he started to move, for the horses the whole lot were riddled with shrapnel bullets as this was July or the beginning of August the smell of the dead was awful during the time we were in
