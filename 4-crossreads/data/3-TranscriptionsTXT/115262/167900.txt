 Sunday 13 May 1917. 
 My 20th birthday. Woke up seasick at 6 am. A cold wind blowing. 
 Hail &amp; rain storms at intervals. 
 Everything bleak &amp; desolate. Nothing in sight but water everywhere. 
 Boat shipping seas. Very rough weather but boat is riding well. Hope I never spend another birthday like this one. Could not stand down below so had to stay above deck. 
 Everybody crook with one or two exceptions. Waves bigger than I&#39;ve ever seen before. 
 Turned in early as I felt very crook. 
 We have after leaving &quot;the heads&quot; come well down south off Tas. west coast. 
 Geo. C. looked after me. He was not sea-sick.
