<p>[Tuesday 25 January 1916]</p>
<p>We have a Welsh Cavalry Regiment near here, mounted on Bob-tailed Suffolk Punch sort of Chargers &amp; the Tommies bump along, much to the amusement of our men on their long tailed Australian 'horses, which stand out above anything I have seen over here- notwithstanding the Patriots who gave all their buck jumping, bridle breaking rogues from each district.  There should be no outlaws left in the back country at all now.<br/>Today such a Blizzard &amp; Khamsin, Darling Shower blew the sun was put out with sand <strike>&amp;</strike> with head down one bumped into others if one moved about &amp; the water holes were filled with sand, teeth, eyes, ears &amp; Tucker all sand- Much joy in the land of Camels</p>
