During the instructions received on this day we were told that all monoplanes belonged to the 3rd Royal Flying Corps being exclusively used for contact work. The B.E.2. type of Biplane is also used for contact work, they being marked with two black strokes under the wings from front to rear & from these also one hung black streamers. When an observer in a plane wishes to know the position of the front line he will give a succession of As on his Claxton Horn, a very deep sounding horn carried by an aeroplane, or by dropping a lighted flare, a special kind kept for such purposes. Either of these signals will be answered by the Infantry occupying the front line by lighting a special kind for this purpose only, in the trench, & when the observer is satisfied that he has located the position he will answer by a blast on the horn.

When the Observer received the information he would answer by a blast on the horn then make straight for Battalion or Brigade Headquarters where he would deliver the message by means of a note, with a weight tied to it, to carry it to the
