 Cayeau and, Left for Bty position forward of Rosieres, with a coil of wire, in company of Gunn. Received a couple of letters of interest from people at home. We returned to Cayeau again at night. Had word from the 8th Casualty Clearing Station that Roy Lewis and Jack Gorrick had died of wounds. He is one of the very best, and I'm very sorry. Had a few visits around the districts but I could find no evidences at hand. Burglar Laurence returned.
