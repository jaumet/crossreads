<p>heartbreaking.  The tobacco Miss Hilda sent I never received &amp; I was so narked.</p>
<p>I'm simply dying for a letter from you, things are dullish here.  I find it very hard to write &amp; there's nothing to read &amp; the evenings are light till 10 p.m. &amp; dawn at 3.30. Our Colonel has got a C.M.G. <strike>one</strike> two of the Majors a D.S.O. [Distinguished Service Order] &amp; another chap a M.C. [Military Cross] so they are having a big dinner tonight to celebrate.  There'll be something doing I reckon.</p>
<p>I wonder if you hear from Duncan.  I haven't heard for ages.  I tried to find Joe tother day again but didn't.</p>
<p>I'm simply dying to be in London or Paris these days, there is opera going strongly at each.  The officers get leave to the latter but they don't allow N.C.Os or men which I think is distinctly unfair.  However such is life in the Military.  I shall have a tale to tell all right when I return.</p>
<p>I must flee now.  My love to Graeme &amp; Mac &amp; the Boss &amp; your very valued self.  I wish I could write decent letters</p>
