<p>right section fired, one gun 13 rounds, and the other 12 rounds, Section salvos.  On my way back to wagon lines, I fired a shot out of a 6 inch Howitzer.  Target, roads.  This was the 38th Howitzer Seige Battery.  We have about 25 horses turned out in good grass at Bty. position;  that was the reason I went to Bty., to have a look at them.  Fancy having horses running loose at a gun position, a few hundred yards in rear of guns.  That will illustrate the quietness of the position.  A large number of gunners sick.  The Doctor says it is black fever.  The sickness lasts only a few days, Temperature up a terrible height, 103 &amp; 104 deg.  Farrier Sgt. Kaglund before the General, applying for a transfer to the Flying Corps, approved by the General.</p>
<p>18-5-1918<br/>Today, hot.  The Huns have registered our Bty.  Shelled heavily last night, no casualties.  Our horses will now be moved.  Enemy planes over again during the night.  Saw an aeroplane photo of Bty., every object showing up plain.</p>
