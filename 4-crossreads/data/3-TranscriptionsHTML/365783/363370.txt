<p>We will be leaving our own mess down here very shortly &ndash; arrangements have been made with a French chef who has had as clients, princes, dukes &amp; marquises to cater for us for 8 piastres (1/8) per day per person.   I have not seen a great deal of Fred, he is a night duty hospital orderly &amp; sleeps during the daytime when I am usually about.   I saw Mick a few days ago &ndash; he wants to transfer from his battalion to this unit &ndash; Fred also spoke to me about changing over to one of the infantry battalions.   I saw Concanon for a few minutes the other day &ndash; he seems to be in very good form.  I have not yet ascended the Pyramids but hope to do so very soon &ndash; they are very weird looking things.   We are having beautiful moonlight nights just now &amp; as I lie in my bed at night &amp; I look through the doorway of my tent I see the great mass of stones right in front of me.   There is plenty going on around us &ndash; hundreds of horses from the lighthorse tents come twice daily to a huge horse trough right alongside us &ndash; there are several Arab villages not very far distant &amp; along the road leading to them there is a constant stream of camels laden with all sorts of things, natives riding donkeys &amp; mules &amp; men women &amp; children of all sizes &amp; colours.   I have had no letters since arriving here but am looking forward to getting some very shortly.<br/>With best love to all &amp; hoping you are all real well<br/>Your loving husband<br/>Will.</p>
