<p>France<br/>27.9.17</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>I am enclosing a photo in this letter for you.I met an old mate of mine.I hadent seen him for over two years so we decided to have the photo taken together. It isn't a very good one but is the best we could get. There is no doubt Australia responded well on Frances day. It is wonderful the way they all subscribe to all those things Yes there is no doubt France has suffered during this war for miles the villages etc are flattened to the ground as a matter of fact a good many places that used to be villages are only a heap of brick dust. One has to see it to fully realize the damage that has been done. I received a card from Bert a few days ago he said he had couple of his letters written to me</p>
