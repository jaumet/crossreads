<p>staunchest friends &amp; have always taken me into the society of their best friends. I leave them about 11 pm. &amp; promise to write some day &amp; adjust a claim for them.</p>

<p>3-5-19 (Sat)<br/>This is morn of departure &amp; the wet weather seems likely to continue so much so that I pay a special visit to town to get my overcoat. Our contingent which is No 45 Quota falls in to time save Welbarn who is in town looking after our luggage &amp; train leaves to time at 3 minutes to 12.</p>
<p>Journey is at first in centre of a wide valley of the vividest green imaginable with a river that winds &amp; unwinds itself in an almost unbelievable manner. Up from the valley rise hills on either side &ndash; bare of timber &amp; cultivated forming a smooth &amp; pleasant contrast with the forest clad summits &ndash; [indecipherable] on both sides here for many [miles] is the exterior edges of two big forests.</p>
<p>Then landscape changes to purely farming areas but the speed of train increases</p>
