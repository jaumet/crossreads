Concerning CarlyleThe furrowed, rough hewn, rugged face;The lank, ungainly, shrunken form;The runner weired of his race;The vessel battered by the storm.
Tuesday 21st Nov.Marched out at 8 A.M. for the A.D.S. & had a very stiff march altho' only about 4 or 5 miles.  The mud was very stiff & tenacious & made walking very difficult.  We were relieving the Guards division & were struck by their particularly fine physique.  The A.D.S. was on a new sector, the "Le Transloy" & closer to the line than the last & was also run by the 14th, the other Ambulances being attached to us.  Huts newly built & hidden by branches were in use, situated in a valley & altogether a very comfortable place, that is if the enemy leaves us alone.  Spent the day in fixing things up & went on night duty at 8.30 for 12 hours.  Ground everywhere pitted with shell holes, so close as to intersect.
Thursday 23rd Nov.On night duty doing 12 hour shifts.  Not much doing as a rule in the way of patients but plenty of noise from the guns, two 6" naval guns being within a 100 yds of us.  The Huns send a few over occasionally but so far none very close.  Roads in a terrible condition & travelling very hard on the patients.  Have not seen much of the surroundings owing to sleeping all day.
