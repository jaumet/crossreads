A much quieter day owing to the fact that nearly all the wounded have been sent away to the Base Hospital.

June 3rd. Sat.
Was in dressing room at 6 am. A chap who had been wounded in the head was there. The bullet went in through the right ear and out through the right eye. After the surgeon had made his examination they decided as he was a serious case to take him into the Operating Theatre. Another chap was lying on the Operating Table dead. The surgeons had done their best to save his life but all to no avail.

Bombs in my opinion seem to make the worst wounds and I am told that the soldiers near an exploding bomb are more often killed than wounded.

Being off duty in the afternoon D & myself walked out to the village of Doulieu between three & four miles away. At the commencement of the war the Germans had occupied this village and when they had to retire out of it again they burned the Church. Nothing but the bare walls of the large church were left standing.

In this part of France one finds on all the roads at frequent intervals shrines to the various Saints of the R.C. church. At these places the devout people come from their farms or homes to pray. One often comes across tall Crucifixes with the figure of Christ
