This afternoon the much talked of looked forward to match between the 1st Field Ambulance our team came off, it was not a pleasant day by any means for a thin drizzly rain started to fall but this did not deter the spectators from turning up, they were there in hundreds all keen followers of the game. There was little or no money to be had on the ground for they snapped it all up yesterday, somewhere between 2 3000 frames the Field Ambulance backed themselves for so confident were they that they could beat our team. Ours was practically the same team as we always played with one or two exceptions they all played a splendid game, we took charge practically from the start a try was scored a few minutes after kicking off, from then on they never had a look in the Ambulance was thunderstruck they never expected to get a licking like they were in for, eventually we ran out winners by 22 to nil
