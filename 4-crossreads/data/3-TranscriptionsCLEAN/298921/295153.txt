  
 July, 1915 Thursday 1 I have made myself as comfortable in my Tent as possible DUG down 2 ft matting floor Egyptian Porous water bottle costs only 1/2 piastre - 1 1/4 D & keeps water like in a water bag. The Heat is no worse than Australia & lovely cool nights - flies are less troublesome now. I bath in a Bucket with [indecipherable] Ammonia twice daily to keep the awful Nettle Rash or Ezcema that so many are suffering from owing to the Heat & sand & lack of fresh vegetables. Personally I prefer Butterflies to Blue noses.
