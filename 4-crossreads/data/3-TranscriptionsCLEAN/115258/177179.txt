  
 Boulac Street Cairo 5th Jan 1919 
 My dear father 
 i received a letter from you yesterday, but it was dated 8th October, so has taken a pretty long time to come. My leave finished yesterday, but I was not too keen on going back to the regiment, now there is no war on, so I went to a chap I knew and told him I wanted a job in Cairo, and I have got on as a pen pusher at AIF HQ. I don't know what the job is like; but it ought to be a new experience, and better than the rain up Palestine way. Jim Ayre has got a job there as well as three or four other chaps I know. B class men held all these jobs before but they have nearly all been sent home now, so they are taking A class men for them. We will live at Ghezereh, at the Kit Stores, which is over the Kasr-il-Nil bridge and about 15 minutes walk from
