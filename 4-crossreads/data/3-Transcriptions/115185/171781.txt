<p>4 - Mr Dowling Mrs Dangars brother Mr Binney are both going home to offer their services to the War office. They do not know yet what use they can be. Young Mr Dangar is also volunteering &ndash; in London. That is the object of his mother's trip he is only 20 and not very strong.<br/>We have been wearing uniforms so far for lectures &amp; dinner but today Dr Fiaschi told us not to do so during the voyage in the tropics. I only have my little white crepe de chine, but suppose it will do for dinner. Our letters are to be censored &ndash; so one does not feel so inclined to write and therefore you must forgive the dullness parents dear. Dr Jamieson is very well and happy. There are a number of interesting people on board - <strike>and</strike> I think you Mother darling would have enjoyed this trip &ndash; as far as you can</p>
