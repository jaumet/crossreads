<p>Methodist Mission<br/>Rabaul, New Britain,<br/>3rd January 1918</p>
<p>My very dear Father,</p>
<p>It was a very pleasant &amp; welcome surprise to-day to receive your long and interesting letter of 21st ult. I was glad to hear that Mother &amp; yourself were able to enjoy the visit to Bundanoon. It is very good of you both to send me the extra fountain-pen, but really Father you should not have worried about it and  the glasses. I have my other pair (which I always kept in reserve) so was not really stuck &ndash; I should have been more thoughtful in writing and mentioned that .</p>
<p>However I appreciate very much your love in sending the glasses. If I return them you will not misunderstand my doing so, I'm sure. While I think of it &ndash; I forgot in my last to say how acceptable your present of those sovereigns proved.</p>
<p>The voyage was much longer than I expected and there were several  <strike>unlooked</strike> unforeseen expenses to meet so your gift was more than acceptable.</p>
<p>I should be glad if you will let Uncle Gus have my *diary p.p. to look through and ask him to please pass them on to C.O.L. for his perusal &ndash; the latter can let you have them at his leisure. I shall not have nearly the time for correspondence that was available at DL. so must concentrate</p>
<p>*except perhaps p.8 after all comparisons are odious.</p>
