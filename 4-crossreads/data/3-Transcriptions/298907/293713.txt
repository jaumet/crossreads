<p>just as soon as they like now I shan't worry in the slightest.</p>
<p>This afternoon Farrell &amp; I went out to Cannon Hill Park, I wanted to get a few shots with my camera round there which I did, after this we kept our eyes open for a couple of good looking girls to spend the rest of the afternoon, &amp; as usual it was me who selected our beauties a pair of sisters &amp; fine looking girls too we spent a real pleasant afternoon with them &amp; arranged to meet them the following day.</p>
<p>30th. Rilen &amp; I were marked out of hospital this morning as we expected, the Sister has got her knife into us properly, at any rate it will do us to get out, we have had a good spin &amp; can't growl</p>
