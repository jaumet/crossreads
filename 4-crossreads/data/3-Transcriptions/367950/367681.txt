<p>24th November 1916 Mosefig  Friday<br/>Packed up and left Hod El Geela this morning at 11 a. m. and marched along through the desert. The trackless desert! There are little tufts of course looking grass growing all about and low scrubby bushes but there is no hard ground &ndash; all sand and extremely heavy going for the horses, we have limber wagons with us as part of the 1st Line Transport. The wagons have broad tyres clamped on to the ordinary tyres (about 9 inches wide).</p>
