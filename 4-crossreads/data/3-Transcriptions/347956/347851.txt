<p>of New Zealanders camped on the same spot the night before last.<br/>This morning we had a reading test to see who were the best men at flag reading; a Brigade signaller came over to superintend it.  the test was to see what men should be in the different grades &amp; the way the S.M. graded us yesterday proved that he had some of the worst men in B grade.
