  Thursday 14th Feb. 18  Yesterday the boys of D'Arcy Dixon's group of religious enthusiasts had a bible class in his little barber's shop where we sleep. I participated. Gray &amp; Vic Hall  and  among others, were there. This afternoon I played two games of chess &ndash; one with Rickson a religious &amp; rather bigoted man  who is particularly narrow minded on the question of cigarettes &amp; the rum issue -- &amp; the other with Strange. Both games I lost, but I gained some experience, &amp; I fancy I shall be quite fascinated with the game.
