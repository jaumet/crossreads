was cold we were wet but you would never think that this would have such an effect. I won't tell you what happened at the 300 better left unsaid, the language was strong, very, why the worst shots who ever held a rifle could have beaten us hollow, we were the picked shots of the Coy. "Lord help the worst", well I laughed laughed till I nearly cried when each mans shoot was signalled back to us, the blank look of consternation amazement that gradually spread over their face, when they found their score totalled about 4 or 5, sometimes a "washout", it seemed so impossible ridiculous that all these crack shots could get no more than these paltry scores I think I enjoyed myself as much as I possibly could, the situation was so funny. The weather was about the only possible explanation, for it was treacherous at any rate I shall never forget this day as long as ever I live, the day when C Coys crack shots went shooting.
