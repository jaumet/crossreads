  
 Strange that I have not heard from J - yet. I'm beginning to think he was only fascinated for the time but I shall not worry over it. Life is too short to be miserable over that sort of thing, when there is so much to do. I'm awfully thankful I can work & feel very fit - My patients are very quiet to-night, shall finish up early & get away to early communion.  Have not received any letters this week from Fred or any of my friends in firing line - evidently some trouble in sending them. Hope you are all well & had a Happy Xmas & New Year. Fondest love & kisses to you all.  From,                                                                                                                                                                      Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                             Edith.
