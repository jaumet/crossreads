  
 After bidding Good Bye to my Second Lady Companion I went into the Wesley Hall where Refreshments are provided by Ladies of the Church which is very kind of them. I had a Cup of Tea & a Sandwich which are provided free. The Ladies of Durban are very kind to us, & try to make us feel at Home. After a Wash & Brush Up in one of the Municipal Lavatories which are built in several places for both Sexes & are up to date & very clean, I took another Tram to Stamford Hill which is in another direction I think there are about 7 or 8 different Tram Routes. I  was  asked the Conductor to put me down at Sutton Park Having been given a Card instructing me where to go I left my Card & had no difficulty in finding the address
