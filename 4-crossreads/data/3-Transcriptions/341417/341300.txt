<p>&amp; proud all over at our men. Any brag is about the other chap &amp; never of himself but the "other chap" is really a wonder.</p>
<p>There's nothing &amp; never has been anything as fine as our lads &ndash; their cheeriness against all odds &amp; discomforts &amp; in the wards the difference when they are our own lads! Happily I'm in charge of an Enteric Ward of 42 beds &amp; nearly all our boys. They do wonderfully well too T.G. but the variations in diet as comp with a civil &amp; what we considered the typical Enteric order of things gives one positive fits of anxiety until one sees it work out O.K.</p>
<p>My dear I am wondering &amp; hoping that you have seen the advt that all Xmas things for No 3. A.G.H. can be sent c/- of the Secs: to a room (Receiving depot) at Winchcombe Carson's who will also send on all goods: Mrs Syd. Jamieson &amp; Louie other lady are the Secs. I'm not begging for myself dear but we should be so grateful for gifts for our men in Comforts foods delicacies wines &amp;c. &amp;c. ad lib: Just at present we expect to be put on &frac12; Rations next week as the Ordnance Dep "through whom all supplies come state that 2 or 3 of our large supply ships have been sunk so that Xmas looks like a time for fasting &amp; prayer rather than a festival Season for us! &ndash; if you &amp; your friends address parcel c/- of me &ndash; I shall see to a judicious distribution of same &amp; shall be intensely grateful &ndash; We are still in tents &amp; feeling the cold a great deal at times. I've had a sharp attack of dysentery but easing off a bit now &ndash; of course am still on duty that goes without saying</p>
