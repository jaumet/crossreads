<p>at Romani Thankful indeed to get back again we have had a hard time on this last trek and I have lost a good deal in weight in consequence My horse thinks that's a good job and he sincerely hopes that I continue to lose weight. He carried me through splendidly he is a hero</p>
<p>24th June. Sat. Romani. 1916</p>
<p>Thirty four years of age today was on Pope's Hill trenches this time last year and the year before <strike>Heliopolis</strike> Australia. Had to stand to arms as usual at 3.35 this morning we still have that to contend with as long as we hold this advanced position. Dont know when we are going back to Hill 70 for a spell The horses are looking rather bad on it and if we have any more of these fancy "Stunts" the horses will not last long. My fellow's ribs are capable of being of being Counted Been resting as much as possible all day.</p>
