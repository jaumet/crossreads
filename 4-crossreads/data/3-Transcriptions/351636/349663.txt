<p>Dear Mr. Layton,<br/>I am sending an application to you from Mrs. Jones who wishes to have her debts paid.</p>
<p>You will see she is much better off than some of our women so I am not sure whether you will consider hers a case worthy of assistance but she appears to have got into difficulties with her payments during illness &ndash;</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>E. M. Wallack</p>
