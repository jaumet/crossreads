13.11.1916    Foggy all day.  Another bombardment all night.  A few shells over our way.  3 horses sent to Vet Mobile Section.  Helping the 1st and 101st Btys with ammunition.  Lieut Little gone forward observing for 24 hours.  Frost coggs, taps and wrenches issued with shoes now.  Another horse lost in bog hole last night.  I got eight horses from D.A.C hooked onto him and pulled him out.  He was bogged from 7.P.M until 10.A.M next morning, none the worse for his adventure.  Driver Blundell, lost last night, arrived in camp 7 oclock this morning.  The Guards regiment are facing our boys.  Our Infantry in a charge met the Prussian Guards two days ago.  A very plucky regiment.  They were cut down like grass.  Dozens of 18 pdrs opened fire on them.  A second time they charged, and again cut to atoms.
