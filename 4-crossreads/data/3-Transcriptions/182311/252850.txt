<p>over&nbsp;<sub>^</sub><sup>soon</sup>&nbsp;we hope and think so.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Two days ago in the long twilight I visited a quiet corner, a soldier&#39;s cemetery and there I saw the grave of my friend Harry Thomas and many others too whom I had known, a noble little band,quiet, but the brigade cross above them was their emblem of the pride and love and grief of their comrades, and of their nation. &nbsp;That is what is wrong with the world, the war and that will be soon over, we hope and believe.</p>
