<p>7/4/19<br/>Marcinelle<br/>Ford car down to H.Q. 2nd M.F.Coy and there met General Cam Stewart with whom I sat as member of a G.C.M on an officer charged with stealing Govt. goods cycles etc.  Brought Col. St Clair home to lunch and then returned to the same place where we sentenced our friend. Returned and had a short rest before dinner engaged on matters of routine. After dinner Selleck proceeded to take a Summary of Evidence in the case of Cowan &amp; Coy.  A.P.Ms and all sorts of other people came too. I spoke my bit at about 11 p.m.</p>
<p>8/4/19<br/>A busy morning. Heard several Orderly Room cases and awarded punishments. A fine sunny day. Our mess very funny with silence &ndash; the naughty Jacky, Freddy &amp; Geo. now very quiet.</p>
