 my moustache off &amp; have now got sore lips for my trouble.  Such is life. I saw an Argus to day dated 4/1/16 &amp; was very interested in it, as this is the latest dated paper I have seen. Am feeling pretty tired on it &amp; am turning in very early. Lots of troops going out presumably to the Persian Gulf.  I was working in the Butts to-day &amp; the way the Bullets zip through makes one think of what it would be like under actual fire. I note by the Argus that L Blomfield is sick in Hospital. Very windy &amp; cold to-night. 
 15.2.16 Tuesday Had a very exciting night of it to-night viz &ndash; I met the old &amp; original Jack Rolfe.  He told me many funny things &amp; is still as talkative as ever.  He also has a Moustache &amp; looks for all the world like a Spanish Brigand. He told me that all were well when he left home &amp; I am very thankful.  We had a great talk of olden times &amp; are going to continue it to-morrow night. Raining all day &amp; pretty cold.
