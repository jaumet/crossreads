Have been getting a lot of mail from home.We are getting variable weather, three days ago the snow thawed all away & remained so a couple of days, then yesterday when we got up we found every thing coveredwith it again. Then again this morning we found the snow all gone & it was raining, so we did not have to go on parade.Sat. 19th 18.- Brigade sports, fine programme of events, the bn. pulled off a good share. Our Keystone band competed against that of the 53rd, we expected others, it was declared a draw. A. Coy gave a consert in the evening & we played again.22.1.18 - Yesterday I went to Boulogne again, had a very interesting time. We visited old Boulogne & looked through the cathedral, it is very fine, the interior is in two parts & has a very fine dome. Round old Boulogne is the old retaining wall, which is about fifty feet high & thirty broad.
