23 September 1918 MondayFusail21 000 prisoners 190 guns now-  Jacko clearing out as usual we rode all night & all day & now expect to go Es Salt way again-  Handley Page [plane] flew over us & must put the wind up Jacko.  Prisoners are a poor lot, not many Germans-   Nights & days merge into one-   it is hard to keep count- in one square acre  I saw a British West Indian  Sikh  NZder  Australian, Tommy  Frenchman  Cavalry & a Tartar & a German so I think & hope we have left the Jordan forever, now marching in Judean Hills on Es Salt.
