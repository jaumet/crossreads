<p>2   go into Mrs Doyle's or Park's   &amp;   go through it all again.  This is now in answer to your letters of the 11th December.  So Ronnie has got the Beach job at last.  It is about all the lazy little devil cares for is the beach.  He is just beach-mad.  We learn from time to time about different ones that we know who have gone under.  I suppose there are many gone that we do not know of yet.  I am going up to London on Tuesday for a couple of days with Dave   &amp;   another chap.  Cyril has written to us from London   &amp;   is still in Hospital though Convalescent.  I will be able to go see Him.  I was walking round the Ground the other day   &amp;   happened to pop into the Duty Room   &amp;   Lo   &amp;   behold there was Reg. Keirle who had escorted a Prisoner over from Perham Downs about 7 miles away.  I spent about an Hour with Him   &amp;   He had Tea in our mess before He motored back to Perham.  I will go over to Tidworth about 5 miles away some Saturday or Sunday,   &amp;   He will meet me there   &amp;   we'll talk about old times.  He is on Guard there at present.  He looks Bonza.  We, who are well, do look well in this climate.  We are pleased to know that the fruit trees are doing well.  Did You have any water-melons this Year.  I knew George would not stick the stiff shirt.  Gee it was cruel for about an Hour.  The Bon-Bon that you sent had the usual Dunce's Cap in it.  A chap will be a bit of a Dunce when</p>
