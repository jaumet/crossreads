<p>"If he had come again at night we could not have held out about 300 strong(a) at night until supported by the 18th Battalion.</p>
<p>"Fritz formed up (for counter attacking) in the long grass, shrubs, and the wood.</p>

<p>"There was a lot of shelling on the 19th Battalion, and "minneys" on the 17th.</p>
