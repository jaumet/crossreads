 If an Australian mail, had arrived the spirits of the troops would have been much better, as it is over 5 weeks since we were greeted with a mail. 
 Between Christmas &amp; New Year we practically had a holiday. On New Year's Day the weather was exceptionally cold but the night birds gave a performance in the evening which helped to cheer the boys up considerably.  This was their anniversary performance.  
 During the last week I have been for quite a number of walks, rather a pleasant past time &amp; it's the only thing to do as the weather is so cold.  It is rather peculiar to visit a village were by few Australians have been before, the inhabitants are very obliging. 
 Nothing of any startling nature occurred till Sunday January 6th.   As you know this day was set apart for a special prayer for peace. A special service was held this morning which was most impressive. In the evening another service was held,  I was highly honoured as I played for these services. It is hard to realize that six days of the new year has gone already,  may the year in which we have entered see the end of this fearful struggle &amp; peaceful &amp; prosperous days come once again. My our loved ones in dear old "Ausy" have the joy of giving us ere this year has run out a welcome home.
