<p>25th Thursday 1915 March</p>
<p>Saw a curious phenomena this morning.  The smoke of a fire was ascending, evidently in the centre of a whirlwind, for hundreds of feet in a perfectly straight pillar.  The sun was directly above it.  This was encircled by a rainbow.  Another white circle cut into the rainbow circle.  We often see columns of sand moving along in a whirlwind.  Any pieces of paper</p>
