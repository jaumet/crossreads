<p>25.8.16<br/>Fri  25th<br/>Feeling off color again this morning but was not bad long. A swimming party went to Mahomediah again today. A young Catholic Padre turned up here a day or two &amp; occasionally drops on for a chat.   Maj Granvilles promotion to Temp. Lieut Col. came out in orders today. It is Capt Whites birthday today &amp; some officers from the 6th &amp; 7th Regts have come over tonight &amp; are celebrating it, &amp; by the noise they are making they must be having a good time; some of our lads have full Scottish uniforms packed away now; the two Jeffreys went away to a Scottish Camp to look for beer, &amp; got too drunk to come home, but they turned up tonight OK.</p>
