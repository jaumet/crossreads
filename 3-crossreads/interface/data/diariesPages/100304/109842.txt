In the centre of our line we held a number of German gun pits captured from them and apparently joining up as a communication trench to their firing line. I decided to seize this and at once put a bombing post on and searched the place with revolver drawn and two bayonet men behind me but we could not find so I was unable to push on towards their trenches but was going to cut a place through later in the day. There was a splendid German dugout here going down over 30 feet and good wooden stairs leading down. Shells were lying round and any amount of souvenirs in the way of rifles and equipment were also there. Propped up against a place and so small and shrivelled was a young Hun who had been dead some time and there were plenty of others lying underfoot. I remember treading on the stomach of one elderly Hun who was blown up like a balloon with the gases of decomposition. Just outside was another half buried lying on his knees in a crouching position
