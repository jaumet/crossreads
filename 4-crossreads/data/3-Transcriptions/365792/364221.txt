<p>May 16 Spose a fellow will get away some day. This Tommy uniform gets on my nerves every time, &amp; in fact all the time. &ndash;</p>
<p>Successfully dodged all toil &amp; then had a shave &amp; haircut. 5 pm am up again on the wall which surrounds the Church of St Joseph. Gee its lovely up here above the crowd &amp; the City. Heard a whisper that im booked for Eng.</p>
<p>17  Paraded down to C.M.I.R. this morning for what I don't know. Evidently the Heads like to muck a fellow about as much as possible Rather heavy fog, so the day should be fine &ndash; Here I am again at No. 13 Stationary waiting for the Doc to turn up. Must word him &amp; see what can be done. &ndash; Later &ndash; Met the Doc &amp; he straightaway sent me to Hospital again &amp; marked me for England. Guess my luck has turned at last, he's some Doctor too &amp; you bet I'm jolly pleased to be back again in the same Ward. Some of the boys are still here.</p>
