<p>for a day or so, and at the same time wished to know where the rum had been removed to.&nbsp; When we told him he got very wild and ordered us to take it back.&nbsp; Of course we refused to do so.&nbsp; He went straight to the Camp Commandant and reported the matter, the latter came down and told us to take the rum back and asked us if we were not aware that noone [no-one?] below the rank of an officer was allowed to have rum in his possession.&nbsp; We informed him why we had taken it away but he refused to listen to us and placed us both under open arrest.&nbsp; This officer was about the best hated man on headquarters, and was ever trying to show his authority.&nbsp; Of course nothing happened to us, the whole thing was fixed up when our boss returned, to the discomfiture of the officious officer.&nbsp; He was accidently killed a few days later.</p>
<p>Spent Xmas day in Peronne.&nbsp; Snow was several inches thick.&nbsp; The enemy wished us the compliments of the season by continuously bombing, resulting in a few being killed.</p>
<p>Walked back to camp in the early hours of the following morning and our boss seeing some small object in the snow on the side of the road, went over and discovered that it was a fellows feet (or rather boots), the balance of his body being under the snow.&nbsp; A few minutes later and his boots would have also been covered, so he was pretty lucky.&nbsp; He seemed a good bit dazed, which was probably due to his being in the snow for so long.&nbsp; The cause of his lying there might have been that he found it impossible to make any headway on the slippery ground!!&nbsp; The road certainly did not appear to be so straight or so easy to walk on as on the previous evening.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I expect it was because we were all pretty tired.!!&nbsp; I shall not forget that Xmas day in a hurry.</p>
<p>We remained in this camp till about the middle of January &#39; 18.</p>
<p>The rum issue was carried out in strict military fashion.&nbsp; It had to be consumed in the presence of an officer.&nbsp; We would all walk to the Q.M. store and receive our small portion and drink it straight away.&nbsp; No one had any chance of getting his teetotal friend&#39;s share.</p>
