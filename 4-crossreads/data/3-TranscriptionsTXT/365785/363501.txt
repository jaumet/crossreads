you have scratched through them.Wilkie Hickson was hit with shrapnel but I think went to Malta.Geo. Henderson another of my sergeants and my chemist in Newcastle was hit here.  I gave him my card to send you, if he goes your way.  If he does I know you will have an eye on him.  I'm lost without him.I hope Will is keeping allright & that B.C. is happy amongst her mates.I am at present A.D.M.S. of this division.  The other chap got sick and went off so I am running the show.  I rather hope he won't come back.  This is a nice change and gives me a chance of a [indecipherable] work, but after we lick the Turks I'm off however.Best love to you allYour affect'n uncleJoseph L.
