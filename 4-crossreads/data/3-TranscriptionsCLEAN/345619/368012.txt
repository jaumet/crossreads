[Post card - cartoon of a German soldier asleep in very basic circumstances with mice crawling over him and dreaming of a woman coming to him carrying a tray laden with food.  The following words are printed on the card:]Ich Traumpt von Kuchen Bieru Schinken;ein Holdes Madchen tatmir winken.Doch ach ashatten unterdessenDie Ratten mir das Brot gefressen.
[Roughly translated I think:I dreamed of cake beer ham;A fair maiden waving at me.But alas meanwhileThe rats have eaten my bread.]
