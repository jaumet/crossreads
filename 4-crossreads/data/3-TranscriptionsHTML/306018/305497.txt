<p>March 1918<br/>&amp; give the mess committee the money.  I think we could do much better.</p>
<p>Friday 8th<br/>Was fairly busy all the morning getting out orders etc.  In the afternoon got a decent book &amp; had a read.  The weather is very close &amp; hot.</p>
<p>Saturday 9th<br/>Went to the Races at Heliopolis in the afternoon.  I picked the winners of the first 2 races &amp; did fairly well up to the last race.  Had a good afternoons sport.  It wasn't a backers day as very few of the favourites did any good at all.  Saw Bob Thorne at the Races &amp; he came into town with me,  He is at the cavalry school.  Saw Frank Grant of Bellingen after dinner in the street &amp; had a yarn to him.  He is also at the School of Instruction.</p>
<p>Sunday 10th<br/>Half the staff got the morning off &amp; many of them went to Alexandria.  I elected to work &amp; will have next Sunday off.  An English mail was in this morning, but got nothing out of it.  Am expecting a parcel. Ella</p>
