<p>"Tarrawingie,"<br/>Katoomba St<br/>Katoomba.<br/>P.S. So far it has not been at all cold here quite as mild as in Sydney.  O.L.O.<br/>My very dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>We have arrived quite safely as you will see and it looks as if we shall be quite comfortable.  The house is about 10 minutes from Station, just past Waratah Street, if you remember that.  There are only about  half a dozen ladies here besides <strike>ar</strike> ourselves &amp; Mrs McMahon the proprietress  seems a clean capable little woman.  The house is very convenient in its appointments, no more inconvenient than if it were in the city, there are nice wide verandahs, a fireplace in the room and I really think we shall be well suited.<br/>Olive makes a splendid companion, very thoughtful and quite bright &amp; cheery.<br/>I am having a rest in a deck chair in the sun while writing this and a note to Rid.<br/>I do hope your cold is better Father dear, was so sorry to hear how bad it was.<br/>Much love to you all- Ollie</p>
