<p>the 6th. Had run out of supplies so had to fly around &amp; get some.  I had my first swim of the season in the "Ancre" the water being quite warm.  Had a trip to Amiens yesterday.  Major Metcalfe was called to London to receive his M.C. so four of us went by car with him as far as Amiens.  We had a good time, the main item being a royal feed, Soup veal, fish, asparagus, omelette etc and Champayne.  Left there after 8 and had an exciting ride back.  The road which is part of the Grand Prix course was in good order &amp; at one time had a race with another Amb. which bumped us trying to pass doing between 30 &amp; 40.  He gave in however &amp; we arrived safely feeling very fit.  Received a new fountain pen from home in the last mail, tres bon.  Weather still good and the place looking beautiful, trees &amp; flowers in full swing, a remarkable change from its appearance</p>
