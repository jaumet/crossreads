It makes a great hit -  Booking duties  & rehearsals during the day - The criticism of Major Maclaine, a "Gentleman of Scotland", who is interested in theatricals. He says (despite the fact that he is in charge of a very popular Concert Party): "Saa-eeda Digger!" has been well written & produced.  It is the most original & artistic show I have seen in France. The artists have been excellently cast for the several characters. If there is any fault it is that in parts it is a little too artistic for troops.
