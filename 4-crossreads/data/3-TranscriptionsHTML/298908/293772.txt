<p>1st October<br/>This book opens with a piece of the best news that I have received for many long days namely a letter from Len saying that he was on his way home to "Aussie".  I am more pleased than if it had been myself that was going, how lucky he has been &amp; all I hope that he is the same through all his life just fancy during these 4 years that he has been in the Army he has never been wounded that's a bit of a record for a front line soldier I should think, he has got a start on me but I don't think we will be long before we are pushing off for this afternoon all the 1914 men were fallen in &amp; all particulars taken of them, so there must be something doing &amp; I hope it comes quick so as we can be home for Xmas.  Everyone has been very pleased today over the fall of Bulgaria, seems to be a rot setting in at last.</p>
