<p>[Typewritten letter]<br/>Copy.</p>
<p>France, 6-3-17</p>
<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>Just came out of the line in time to receive your letter of abour 3rd January and it quite bucked me up as we were feeling pretty down after a rather strenuous four days in reserve and four days in the line.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got leave of absence and went looking for Fergie who was somewhere in the backward area resting. Travelling in this part of the world is exceedingly uncertain and one has to depend a great deal upon motor lorries, wagons etc., and to take the risk of finding one going in the right direction. Yesterday I was lucky enough after walking a couple of miles to find a huge lorry going within a few miles of my objective &ndash; so being an Officah (ahem) I stopped it and demanded a lift. I had a front seat and so had a glorious drive, though not to be compared with the comfort to those we had in the old N.A.G. of glorious memory. It was an old London bus converted and the roads are rather broken, it rather resembled a steamer crossing the Channel. However, once out of the forward area we had a most enjoyable trip. The road was a typical French road lined on either side by huge poplars and elms and beyond it  was the real French country, the first I had seen. It was so beautiful and restful after the front line and the fact of there having been a four inch fall of snow lent an added charm. The road itself, like all others in the vicinity, is used for military purposes. As far as the eye could see was a constant stream of traffic in both directions, a heterogeneous collection of all imaginable kinds of vehicles from the latest type of Rolls-Royce to an old donkey cart driven by a casual Australian. After several hours, the lorry dropped me at a cross road and two miles walking brought me to Fergie's billet &ndash; a fair sized village which differed from most  in that it had not suffered from shell-fire of any description.<br/>I found Fergie quartered in a huge French chateau of three storeys, quite intact with ancient mural decorations and pictures exactly as they had been for scores of years. Fergie and I were delighted to meet again and spent a happy hour yarning over all that had happened to us. He was looking exceedingly fit and cheerful and is apparently carrying out the duties of his new position with great success. He had just heard from home, as I had, and had received a cake which I helped to demolish. As my time was precious we went down to see the General after an hour, and I was introduced to him. He was very pleased to see me and we had quite a long chat. He was very interested in what I was doing and how I was getting along, and asked after you &ndash; then I left to come back here again, and I had gone about &frac12; mile on my way when Holmes' car overtook me &ndash; he immediately stopped, picked me up and took me to the nearest place where I could get a lorry, so I had a pretty good day. I then managed to get a lift from a R.A.M.C. Car which travelled all the way back at about 30 m.p.h.  I also met Calderwood, the other night. He has just returned from England to take up duty with his Battalion and was able to give me a good deal of news about Myrton, since he left Australia.  He confirmed what I had already heard about how the accident occurred but gave me some new details. Myrton was in charge of the bombing dump at the beginning of the Pozieres stunt and was coming up Sausage Valley (famous to all Australians here a destined soon to become a household name out at home) with a truck load of bombs, and it was here that the accident occurred. Poor old Myrt. was buried in the Australian Cemetery in Sausage Valley and Calderwood has promised to take me there as soon as we get a chance of leave which, under the circumstances, is quite probable.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why they have not written to you nor why his effects have not turned up, the only reason that I can see is that the Colonel of the battalion was away sick at the time, having only recently rejoined, and all the other officers, including Calderwood and Mearns, with a great proportion of the men were killed or wounded and left the battalion either permanently, or at any rate, for several months. At any rate, as soon as I get near the Battalion, which is probable in the next few weeks, I will make full enquiries re his kit and effects.</p>
