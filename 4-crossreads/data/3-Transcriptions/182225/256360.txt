<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; TUESDAY 29&nbsp;&nbsp; AUGUST</p>
<p>A miserable day. It rained all day &amp; blew a young gale&nbsp; I was heartily sick of the whole affair &amp; had a real attack of the blues. The signalling class had buzzer work in the empty huts in 18 camp. There was a muster parade in the huts in morning &amp; Col. Pearce was round. Bill Hunter &amp; self went to the pictures at night &amp; got very wet for a rotten show.</p>
