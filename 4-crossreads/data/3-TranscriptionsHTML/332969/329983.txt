<p>laying killed &amp; wounded by this time night was coming on &amp; I was detailed off to go &amp; carry water &amp; amunion up to our line I can tell you it was a long carry from the Beach six of us set out with a load each but only two of us arrived as the others were all wounded. I thought it was the longest night I ever put in there were wounded &amp; killed laying every where</p>
<p>Well we are now in a place called Browns Dip it somewhere about a week since we landed things have <strike>quait</strike> quitened down a bit since then.  Diary writing has been out of the question as any spare moments one was very glad to get a little sleep.  We have got fairly good trenches dug &amp; we are all busy making ourselves dug outs. During the last week I have been detailed off as a stretcher bearer to my Coy. B Company. as all the old bearers have been killed or wounded.  I might say I lost my tobacco in the landing &amp; I havent had a smoke for over a week what would I give for one. any thing. but again I would give more for some steak &amp; onions</p>
