<p>7th April 1916  March ed off with full packs (our blankets were carried for us) at 8 o'clock and joined the rest of the Brigade at about 10 a.m.  At about five miles out we were received by Gen Joffre and staff.  The General was just about as I expected to find him.  Altogether we March ed about 18 or 20 miles and by the time we reached our billet we were tired out.  Passed through numerous Villages on the way.</p>
