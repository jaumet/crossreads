Friday 11th
Another route march, with Johnny Moore. Went through some very pretty country. The farmers are all busy getting in their crops of Wheat and Oats which are looking remarkably well. The women work just as hard as the men, even to cutting the corn, but in most cases, the men do the cutting and the women the binding. We passed several pretty little cottages which had very fine orchards attached, and the apples and pears looked very tempting. We got back to the farm at about 1 where a jolly fine dinner was waiting us. After dinner we spent a few very pleasant hours doing some more weeding. Nugget Bennet is on trial for saying just what he thought of the officers of the 8th ----------and they heard him.
Saturday 12th
More bloomin? weeding. But in another morning at it Glory! Hallelujah! Strawberry Jam on the Menu. After dinner we went with Corp. Fallon to the baths at Sailly. Or rather we were supposed to have done so, but Dodson, Wrighty and I fell out and spent a very pleasant afternoon at a pretty little wayside cottage where we indulged in light refreshment "Nugget" is under close arrest now, so his case is looking serious. The usual nightly bombardment took place and we did not get to sleep till nearly midnight.
Sunday 13th
Anniversary of the formation of the "Gallant Eight" 12 months ago today Col. Shepherd and the "Big Roan" came to Liverpool and picked out A. B. Sections. This morning the Col. made quite a decent speech about it, and said he was proud to be O.C. of such a fine Corps and a few more nice things, and ended up by calling for 3 cheers for the 8th which were given with justice, considering we were cheering ourselves. Then we adjourned to the Mess Hut where Cosier conducted a very enjoyable service. The singing was fine every man doing his best to make it a success. "Cose" preached a jolly good sermon, and we ended up by singing the Nat. Anthem.
