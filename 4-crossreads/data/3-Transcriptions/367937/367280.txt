<p>We don't get much war news out here but they seem to have been doing good work in France; dont think we will see any more fighting round here as the Turks got it too hot. I'm jolly glad I was in time for the scrap though.<br/>To come back to smaller things &ndash; When I was at the Canteen on Saturday night I left my haversack beside the Guard tent while I did my shift on Guard, forgetting that there was anything in it; when I came back the haversack was open and I then remembered that my camera and compass were <strike> both</strike> in it but they were both gone; some drunken wretch must have taken them.<br/>Of course it was my fault for being careless but I had forgotten about things being shaken because you never loose anything in the Regt. but of course at the Canteen there are men from all over the place.<br/>I have put up a notice offering 10/- reward in hopes that he will bring it back for the money but I don't expect to see it &ndash;<br/>Later  The parcel containing my shirts etc has arrived so my luck is in again &ndash; The shirts are not too bad at all though they are pretty big of course, but they will be grand for here. The handkerchiefs were good as I am a bit short of them. We have just had another issue of War Chest stuff 2 lbs of Lemon &amp; Melon jam per man My Word it is great Also a chap was put into out tent for a few days &amp; a parcel came for him which he shaired with us;</p>
