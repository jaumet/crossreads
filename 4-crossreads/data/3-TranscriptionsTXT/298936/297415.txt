Spent a rough night on deck in the rain but overcame the difficulty by wrapping myself in a waterproof.
The nights are getting much colder now, &amp; the days cooler.
Usual parades &amp; drill with the addition of allotments of places &amp; duties by lifeboat &amp; a lot climbing around discovering falls &amp; man ropes.
If a torpedo hit us I am willing to wager that only half the boats would get away, for the difficulties of a list would require far more organisation than we have.
