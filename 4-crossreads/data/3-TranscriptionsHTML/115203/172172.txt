<p>attention to my prayers this night, but bless your heart that was nothing to what was coming. The next day they brought us up to the trenches or at least the support trenches to see a bombardment which started at 4ock and lasted exactly one hour anything to equal the din and noise one could not realize but it was a fine sight I saw a shell knock the cornice off a farmhouse and the next one laid it quite flat, I often wondered if anyone was in it what a ghastly scene it must have been inside, after the bombardment came a charge&nbsp;but we were to far away to see what regiments were participating anyhow only a slight advance was made, owing to the failing light we could not discern what was going on clearly so the order came to retire our services were not needed that day much to our relief we had this night to sleep - well when I say sleep I&nbsp;mean from about 7 till 10 we moved away from this camp at 11ock on account of heavey shelling which came pretty freely. then we had to dig in again on fresh ground, I may say that this digging in process used to get on my nerves You no sooner got a nice snug posse with</p>
