<p>27.10.15<br/>Wed 27th<br/>3 lads of D.Sqd (the old 12th) were slightly wounded this morning coming from the 1st Reserve trench to the firing trench, about 50 yds separates them &amp; one is in full view of the Turks going that 50 yds, &amp; as the Turks are only 350 yds away it is a marvel some of us have not been fired at before, as it is becoming a thoroughfare as it is a few yds shorter than following the trench along; The Turks Artillery open up at 10 oclock this morning &amp; shelled the beach very heavily making everyone there take cover, I was ready to go for a swim when they commenced &amp; I altered my mind: I believe the C.O's of the 1st L.H. Bde held a meeting &amp; decided to go to Mudros for a months spell (the whole Bde) The troops have not been told officially yet; The majority of men wish to stay where we are</p>
