Very cold out.</p>
<p>Friday 31 January 1919<br/>Still on the train. Had tons of stops. The boys ratted a couple of supply trains &amp; got wine etc. Quite a lot finished up being drunck. The driver took his engine off at Arras because he couldn't get a relief We waited there 10 hours till the frogs put an engine on. Got plenty of strain</p>
