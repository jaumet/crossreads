<p>My dear Girls:</p>
<p>9-20 p.m.  The letter completed this morning was stamped, posted, and mayhap now it is as far as Cairo on its road to Macquarie Street Sydney.</p>
<p>An envelope was handed to me during a late hour of the morning.  On opening it the contents were two post cards from Mrs. M. M. Knowles.  One was written upon, telling me of some of her men relations in a battalion here, and that she had posted Melbourne papers to my address, The Advocate, Punch, &amp; The Bulletin.  Was it not good of her to think of sending them.  I shall look out each day for their arrival.  The second card had on it a photograph of her elder boy.  A good looking lad with high forehead, to whom she gives the credit of being clever &amp; industrious, she has another, not too strong looking laddie.  I saw him when I was in Melbourne.  I have already posted reply to her note.</p>
<p>This afternoon an officer was to afternoon tea.  He was in Sydney on the 12th of Febry.  He told me that then Macquarie Street was in the same place &amp; in much the like state, as far as he could judge, as it was when I left it on the 24th Novbr.  It was pleasing to converse with some one who had been so near to you within five weeks or thereabout.</p>
<p>Was for a ride through the date palm forest between 5 p.m. &amp; 6-20 p.m., enjoyed the gallop, &amp; came home fit to partake of dinner, of which two courses suited me.  Writing mostly since.  Shall look at an illustrated paper then read some books, &amp; in due course go to bed.</p>
<p>Good night!  Good night!!!  Good night!!!!!</p>
<p>22-3-15. 10 a.m.  At 7 a.m. mounted on my horse I set out for a ride.  The air on the plateau of the dessert was invigorating</p>
