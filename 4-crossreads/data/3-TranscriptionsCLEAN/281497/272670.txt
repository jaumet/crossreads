  
 5th. This morning the Colonel was out on parade watching the N.C.O. drill the men, he is a very particular man but a fine soldier & the best we have had in the Battalion so far I believe we are losing him shortly Got my second stripe today & am now a full Corporal thats not bad considering its only 7 weeks ago since I got the first one 
 Its all over the place about me being recommended for a commission, the Headquarters Signallers let the cat out of the bag. Got orders to pack up & be ready to move off at any time probably tomorrow, for we generally move of a Sunday
