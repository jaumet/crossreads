China is one of her hobbies (she has another) I found in every room more China. She sold some thousands of pounds worth of this hobby to advance her other hobby. Aunt was not there but Uncle Harry was there to receive me. He is in uniform being a major in one of the Sussex regiments, an eye specialist &amp; all cases of eyes that come to the military hospitals in and around Brighton are attended to by him.
