<p>20/4/19<br/>Paris<br/>Did not wake up until &frac14; to 10.  Had a hot bath dressed in mufti and walked through Place Vendome to Opera and then along to Madeline. A great crowd was going in and out the old churches and an American was taking bioscope pictures of it. Went in and found a great mass being celebrated this Easter Sunday. The music was exquisite both vocal and instrumental. The crowd was like an Opera audience. The old cocked hat sacristans are well known identities here. Tubed to Gare de L'Est and booked through to Strassburg tonight. There was a little excitement on one of the platforms between a man &amp; a woman. Came back to Opera and walked along Bde. des Italiens to an Italian caf&eacute; (Poccardis?) opposite Arrigonis. Lunched here and then made for the Louvre</p>
