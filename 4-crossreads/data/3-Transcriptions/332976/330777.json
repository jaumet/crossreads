<p>December 1916<br/>(25th Continued)   During the day we received a lot of private parcels &amp; also parcels sent to the company from people in Sydney which we divided amongst ourselves.  The officers of the company treated us to Champagne &amp; Wine &amp; we had a fairly merry time.<br/>26th   Another free day &amp; we were at liberty to roam the country (within a mile radius.) but we were not lax in our celebration of Xmas.<br/>27th   We started work to-day.  I have been detailed <strike>to</strike> with a party of twelve sappers for work in this town under the supervision of the "Town Major"   This morning I went around with he &amp; Lt Oliver to the various billets to inspect them &amp;</p>
