Dear me I felt desperate - so approached Matron but the answer I got was what I had expected "No Sister She Said there is no getting out of it You must be done.  Then I ask for permission to see a medical man - to tomorrow am seeing Major Martin &  hoping that he'll be kind & let me off.  Poor Anne if you think she is mentally weary - you'll think right so that is why I am putting you off for another time.  I'm sure if it wasn't for the pleasure of working and doing for the boys & that I may say is the biggest blessing we have we should all be rushing to do transport work to Australia.
April 6th  Twas no use I had to submit to the inevitable but I think Sister was kind & gave me a small dose for I scarcely felt the effects.
Now what do you think we are Settling down & are getting into working order.  The patients are being sent away.

It really looks as if we might expect another move shortly - we wonder where - We would it were that the war was over & it were to Australia.  The boys call it God's own Country & so it is.  A little while ago when we went for a drive to see the Holy Tree at Matarich Sister Hoadley remarked "Yes the more one goes about & the more we see all goes to point to the one end & that is to love Australia more.
