<p>We have football matches &amp; boxing &amp; concerts <strike>but</strike> at least they are held but I have been far too busy to attend.  I've been going eyes out for the last three weeks.  Even my outings have had a business bent &amp; they have been few.</p>
<p>I am not living right with H.Q. at present.  I did for a night but there was not room for us all to work so I &amp; my assistant moved &amp; we have this nice old French farm practically to ourselves.  It is run by an old man, a dear old chap with the face of a saint, he has four daughters &amp; they graft harder than anyone I've ever seen &amp; yet they are splendid women &amp; so jolly &amp; full of fun.  They go at it from 5 a.m. till 9 p.m. &amp; all sorts of work we wouldn't dream of women touching.  And yet they all cook &amp; sew.  They'd make a fortune on an Australian farm in a very few years.  Two of them are quite handsome.  I'm hoping we'll stay here for ages.  I have a nice room &amp; a bed with sheets &amp; also an office.  The days are so short, dark at 4.30 &amp; the day is over at 3-30.  Not light till 7.30 but the turning point is pretty near.</p>
<p>Very heavy frosts the last three days &amp; of course very cold but better that than rain &amp; anyhow the days are bright if not warm.</p>
<p>Our old Colonel is gone &amp; I'm grieving muchly.  He was a sport, &amp; such a wit &amp; I understood him so well.  I could have followed him to Hell, he'd do me.  His successor is quite a different sort.  A good solid kind man &amp; I suppose I'm queer in my</p>
