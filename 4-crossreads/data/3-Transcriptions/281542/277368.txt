Ian Hamilton &amp; staff whose H.Qs. are at Imbros was bombed considerably by 3 Taubes.  Ian had narrow escape from one bomb.  I have noticed these Taubes lately.

<p>A Turkish deserter, Ismail Mahomet Ali, 5th Co. 2 Bn. 24th Reg. was brought in today.  He appeared to be in good health but complained of sore feet.  He was only wearing thin shoes.  He was dressed in a khaki cloth jacket &amp; trousers with a soft cap.  <strike>He</strike>  I would say he was a middle aged man.  Examined, he said he came from a vilayet of <strike>Sym</strike> Smyrna, but that he was fed up with fighting, like a lot more of the Turks in his Co.  He said the Turks had heaps of food &amp; water, brought up by mules &amp; then into the trenches by fatigue parties.  He had only seen one German officer during his month's active service.</p>
