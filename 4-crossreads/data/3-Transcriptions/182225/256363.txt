<p>SEPT.&nbsp;&nbsp; FRIDAY 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine &amp; fairly warm. I was picked out to drill with the NCO<sup>s</sup> &amp; drilled under Lieut Hill all morning and was doing a bit of gun laying in afternoon under Warren Hogarth. We were all inoculatd the second time for &quot;para-typhoid&quot; in the afternoon &amp; we all had pretty fair arms at night. Bill &amp; Jack Hunter &amp; Self went up to the picture show at night, but it was not much good.</p>
