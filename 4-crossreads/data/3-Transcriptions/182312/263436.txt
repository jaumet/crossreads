<p>the contestants are so hemmed in by the sides of the trench that the</p>
<p>bomb produces its maximum effect and soon has the trench or sap</p>
<p>choked with dead and wounded.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to enter into</p>
<p>details of the xxxxxxxx fighting as these have been so graphically</p>
<p>described in the papers from time to time and are really a repetition</p>
<p>of the same sort of thing which has been going on ever since this</p>
<p>summer&#39;s offensive started.&nbsp; Ground has to be gained foot by foot and</p>
<p>no advantage is too small to be held and pushed to the utmost.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>German is a tough nut to crack and resists vigorously so that every</p>
<p>little advantage is gained only after extremely hard fighting ending</p>
<p>up with the bomb or the bayonet.&nbsp; And all this is going on in a strange</p>
<p>hail of bullets, bits of shell, shrapnel, lumps of earth, stinking</p>
<p>gasses, both poisonous and lachrymatory, chemical powders, liquid</p>
<p>flames, all mixed into clouds of smoke and dust and through it all</p>
<p>our troops push on, fighting every yard of the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall gain the coveted line on the other side of</p>
<p>Thiepval, Courcelette, Martinpuich, and Combles before the winter;&nbsp; of</p>
<p>that I feel sure, but I doubt whether the Australians will see it.</p>
<p>A push on the part of the French to the south of Combles (where the</p>
<p>British and French join up) will then make our position for the winter</p>
<p>secure, but should time permit, further advantages may be sought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My term in the front line of the Somme region was six</p>
<p>days, at the end of which I was incapacitated by a bullet through the</p>
<p>thigh sustained during a night attack on the enemy&#39;s trenches opposite</p>
<p>our own.&nbsp; Six days was probably the average, or perhaps a little</p>
<p>more than average, time for a man to last in that inferno where you</p>
<p>were often cut off from food and ammunition supplies and had no means</p>
<p>of communicatiing with the outside world other than by pigeons.&nbsp; Not</p>
<p>only the front lines but the whole terrain in the rear lie under such</p>
