Fierce wind sprang up and nearly blinded us with sand. We were out on a march but got back to camp in double quick time, where we were kept busy for a few hours pegging down tents and weighting them down with sand bags, Capt Lind is away on 2 days leave.

Sand storm still raging, Our tents were nearly buried in the sand when we turned out this morning. Capt Irving took us out for a route march. We were sitting down having a spell when an aeroplane flapped down almost on top of us. Something had gone wrong with their engine, so they had to alight and send back to the aerodrome for new fittings. It was very interesting to see the instruments they carry, even to a wireless outfit. They also carry a very serviceable looking quickfiring gun. When we got back to camp, the sand storm was so bad that the cooks brought the stew round to our tents and served it out. It was almost dark with the flying sand. Some of the sand hills round our camp are blown beyond recognition. We pegged out tent down and put sandbags on ?em, even then it was just as much as we could do to keep ?em down. The mail is a jolly long time coming, haven't had a decent mail for quite a month, beginning to wonder what is wrong. Wrote a long letter to Cis.

Hooray, got 2 letters this morning one from France and 1 from Cis, telling me of Mother's departure for Sydney, which must have been exciting. It poured in rain all the morning and the crowd out on the march got wet through. I was one of a party told off to square up the camp, so was lucky for once and kept dry.
