<p>5 April, 1916<br/>Selhai [Salhia]<br/>This morning they turned us out at three oclock, &amp; it was all bustle.  When watering horses we struck trouble &amp; were delayed but got away shortly after six.  It was a long dreary ride across the desert to this place about 25 miles but into a fine camp here.  We have the lines down &amp; the tents up &amp; already are more comfortable than at Serapeum.  We have mess sheds here which are a boon after the sand.  I felt a new man after a good [indecipherable]<br/>&amp; a shave</p>
<p>Tom was telling me how he was up before the Major this morning, he came along with the baggage on the train &amp; it appears that he was doing a galloping stunt on a donk in the village here &amp; rode express into a caf&eacute; where the Brigade Major was having some eggs etc.  the donc propped &amp; slid along the floor knocking the B.M's table over.  Tom was told to be more careful in future.  I fancy the young beggar has been having a good time. hes wearing a vivid red handkerchief round his neck &amp; I heard him tell Johno that he does not know how  it came to be in his possession</p>
