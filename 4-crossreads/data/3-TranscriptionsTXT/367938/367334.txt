 Bivouac at Popes Anzac. 21.7.15 &ndash; 
 &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; It has been impossible to write much lately &amp; will have to rely on former good  resolution  reputation. If I enlarge on it it will only be a tirade on heat &amp; flies &ndash; practically impossible to do any thing except just climb through one's necessary work. All more or less sick you know &ndash; &amp; &ndash; its too hard to explain. &ndash; the flies are like a few  hives  acres of overturned beehives. 
 I was awfully pleased with two parcels which came at their right times &ndash; Please thank everyone. Con's handkerchiefs a good sort &ndash; socks not wanted yet as my others do not quite stand up straight yet when taken off &ndash; Thank Lola. Did I tell you the soap was surrounded by a gaping crowd who all walked up to &amp; smelt it. Have only used soap about 4 times between May 12 &amp; July 21st. The milk tablets am trying to keep for our advance &ndash; they will be better than anything. Thank Margaret &amp; Phil for the Lucy Hinton &ndash; Everything almost in use. 
 Also had parcels from Cairo &ndash; groceries &ndash; so have really done much better lately &amp; am fairly strong. Our M.O. now is Pietro. 
 Your letters so interesting &ndash; the life being so deadly dull. It is not expected to be so much longer. Have just come off the hill &amp; so have not washed in salt water for a week, wish to walk to the beach after dark.
