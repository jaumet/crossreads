The Better Land
1.  I hear thee speak of a better landThou call'st its children a happy bandMother where is that radiant shore?(Shall we not seek it) & weep no moreIs it where the flower of the orange blowsAnd the fireflies dance through the myrtle boughsNot there: not there: my child.
2.  Is it far away in some region oldWhere rivers wander o'er sands of goldWhere the burning rays of the ruby shineAnd (the diamond lights up) the secret mineIs it there sweet mother that better landNot there: not there: my child
3.  Eye hath not seen it, my gentle boyEar hath not heard its deep songs of joyDreams cannot picture a world so fair(Sorrow or death) may not enter thereTime doth not breathe (on its fadeless bloom)Far (beyond the clouds) (Far beyond the tomb)Far beyond the clouods - beyond the tombIt is there, It is there My child it is thereTis there
