<p>you I feel very proud of it.<br/>I went over the bags on the 23 of August and took part in the taking of the monster gun (15 inch) by the Australians, also two thousand prisoners.<br/>Well Miss King we are soon going to have a long rest and I think it well earned dont you? I will be going to England any day now and I am looking forward to a good time.<br/>I am pleased to hear of the good work you good Australian people are doing for us boys and I am sure we are rewarding your efforts by continuing to make name for our dear homeland.</p>
