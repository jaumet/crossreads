The North Sea BattleJune 1st 1916
A lot of German dreadnoughts came a steaming from the KeilRelying on their Majesty & mightTo frighten any merchantmen the darkness might concealThey thought that they could put them all to flight
But some of Britain's Cruisers were a cruising round the seaThey fastened like a bulldog to a trampAnd though they lost some chips they played hell among the ShipsAnd lots of German dreadnoughts left their stamp
They pommelled at each other and our cruisers held their own'Gainst German's High Sea Fleet so proud and boldBut though our boys were up against the best the Germans hadThey strove the old traditions to uphold
