<p>[Sketch] East of small pyramid looking to quarry West of second pyramid Sunday 14/3/15</p>
<p>1 stone near second pyramid measures app 23x62ft not including another piece running at right angles to the main block. Another 24x45 app.</p>
<p>We had never before definitely settled the age and the height of the pyramids. It became of vital importance to us to know who had built them and why how and when. The mathematicians became involved in abstruse mental calculations to decide whether that pyramid really covered 13 acres of ground or not. Many notable original <strike>and</strike> hypotheses were put forward. One gentleman found the explanation of the possibility of their construction in the fact that at the time they</p>
<p>were built gravitation had less pull. Our vivid imaginations gave us startling pictures of that buoyant period. Men walked up the sides carrying a ton block like a portmanteau. Others hoisted 20x8ft pieces on their shoulders &amp; walked with it as though it were a bag of wheat. Also, it wouldn't matter much in those days if you fell. A man in a hurry would simply <strike>fling himself forward and when in these dull times slowly</strike> take 3 bounds in order to come from the top of the pyramid where in these dull times we <strike>labour</strike> progress labouredly for 10</p>
