<p>14 Friday</p>
<p>Long hard day.  So cold &amp; tired I could scarcely crawl to evening meal at Mess tent &amp; swallowed a wasp which stung me half way down the inside throat &amp; I had a [indecipherable] &amp; uncomfortable night.  Very angry with administration incapable of protecting staff from flies or wasps.</p>
