 1917 Sunday 20 May A fine joyous day . Duti per usual . Afternoon off . Bath then sleep a littl , read . Jockey sick Wait on him . Over to cliff after tea write up diari . Back to Y.M.C.A. to even servic . Tis when we sing the peerless old hymn of our church amp childhood that the long for home kindr rush upon one to be onc more back to the old hous haunt face . How this heart cri out in long for it all . That this aw slaughter [indecipher ] be stop . That at the wicked that stalk abroad open unasham . War develop the beast in human be to a shock extent . Is the war to be one of extermin ? The Almighti 's way of purg the race --- if so there are mani to fall yet .
