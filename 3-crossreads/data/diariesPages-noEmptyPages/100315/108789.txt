no one was at all the worse. Walked up forward to Pioneer Trench, passing through a moderate barrage and met Rodda and Sparrow discussing several matters of carrying c. Our guns knocked down this afternoon the celebrated Falling Virgin of Albert commonly known as Mademoiselle or Fanny Durack.

Grey wounded.
