  
 Wednesday The men are on railway fatigue working up in the front area. The weather being bright & fine, there is great aerial activity. I witnessed a thrilling & awful sight, this morning a Hun plane was attacked by 2 or 3 of ours at a height of about 10,000 ft. He fought well, but was handicapped & he was seen to swerve & a jet of flame shoot out as he plunged headlong to earth, he regained control flew a little farther then fell, one wing snapped off and the machine spun round & round in its headlong death dive Then a small black object keeping pace with the machine & then falling back could be seen It was a man falling from thousands of feet up in the air An awful sight. Smashed
