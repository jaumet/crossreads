<p>26 &ndash; 27  Nov</p>
<p>posted up this morning.  but it only told us that the Indian troops had captured 3 machine guns &amp; similar news, but did not say how the war was progressing &amp; nothing about the reverse in Africa.  We would be a lot more contented if they published all the war news that comes through.<br/>We passed through the Straits of Babel Madelo at 2 P.M.<br/>practising Morse flags all day.  another horse died.</p>
<p>Fridy 27th<br/>I was on duty from 6 to 8 &amp; from 12 to 4 during last night, had a cup of tea as we were coming off at 4 oclock this morning.  All the boats had orders to sail along last night with no lights &amp; we were to do signalling with the lamps only on urgent messages  (The officers on this boat are always barking at the officers on the Hororato &amp; the Hororato barks back;</p>
