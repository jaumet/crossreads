 October, 1915 Wednesday 13 Mardi Miss Cook &amp; Mrs [indecipherable] came to dinner tonight at El Hoyat so I did not leave but sent my Kit on ahead to Camp. Received letters from England &amp; from Australia. I note there is a lot of "Triumphant Arch" &amp; "Cock a doodle" business about the returned soldiers, which like the African war I suppose will have died a natural death by the time the real show is over. Facing it the second time takes doing, when you know what is in front, there is such a thing as the "Valour of Ignorance" - but I must finish my job.
