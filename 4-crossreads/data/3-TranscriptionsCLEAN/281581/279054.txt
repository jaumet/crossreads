 General Cheuvalle [Chauvel] rang me up a few days previously to return to Descorps (Dieran) and take a group of the Administrative Officers of the A.I.F.Forces who are all on a visit to Corps. I regretfully bid adieu to my very kind friends at the Flying Corps where I hope to return in a few days to complete their programme and with the car went on to Dieran via Lutron about 35 miles. The road was very bumpy, but I enjoyed the trip as there were many curious sights taking place along the road. Great activity is noticeable in the transport section and I hear rumours a "stunt" is shortly to come off near Jerusalem. Our First Brigade I also observed on the Warpath. A   great string of tractors hauling guns and camp
