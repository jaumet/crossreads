 Move back to the Jordan Valley tomorrow!  it cannot be so Hot as it was but bad enough.  Am arranging for Kia-Ora-Cooee a paper to be sent direct to you.  Saddles (92) arrived at 4 AM & had to be put together & issued, all our old ones were damaged by Shells & handed in at Jericho. My remount looks upon me as his mortal enemy & flounders along I wonder how they "break in" horses in S. America!
