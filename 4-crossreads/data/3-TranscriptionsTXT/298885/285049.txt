 Sat. Feb. 19th -16 My first "Manly Daily" blew in and to be sure I read it from top to bottom. 
 Mon. Feb. 21st -16 Visited Egyptian Museum.  Saw the valuable and quaint antiques dating back thousands of years.  In the jewel room arranged in separate cases you see curious looking jewellery which belonged to certain princesses of that time.  The mummies, some uncovered, and some covered.  Those uncovered show the great preserving power which the embalming material possessed.
