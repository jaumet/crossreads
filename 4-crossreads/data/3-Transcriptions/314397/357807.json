<p>along the main road. Made McGowan &amp; I do the prom for a few minutes. Am to go to Corp School on the 17th. It is all infantry stuff.</p>
<p>Monday 12.8.18.<br/>Nothing for us to do today so am going for a look round. Capt Pattinson &amp; I went for a look round the country. Walked from here (Warfusee) to Bayonvillers &amp; saw Dad Hether &amp; then caught a lorry &amp; went to Harbonieres. Had a look there. The place is knocked about, but not half as much as this place. From there we walked to Guillaucourt &amp; Wiencourt. Between these places there is a big ammunition dump that used to belong to Fritz. Also a big Prisoners of War camp. Was very interesting. We then got a lorry to Marcelcave &amp; saw 'A'  Coy. We also saw near Wiencourt the big armoured train. Gee it's a bonny gun. 11.7". Hope they turn it on old Fritz soon. Do him good. Lieut Brown rejoined today.</p>
