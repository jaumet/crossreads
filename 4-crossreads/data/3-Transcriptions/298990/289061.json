<p>Buire&ndash;sur&ndash;Ancre, Fricourt, Mametz 3/11/16 Early breakfast. All hands on cleaning up. At 9am we passed the starting point and commenced our march to Mametz.  The filthiest muddiest march imaginable, each step the horses took splattered drops and splashes over everyone in front.  The scenes we passed through were marvellous.  For miles we formed part of an enormous slow moving never ceasing chain of traffic consisting of soldiers , horse and motor vehicles, artillery etc.  Stretching in all directions were camps of cavalry, troops and depots &ndash; like some enormous ant heaps.  We passed one casualty clearing station with its special railway siding and train waiting.  The mud was shocking, one man stepped off the road and became hopelessly bogged.  If these roads were not good the condition would be hopeless.  Traffic control is a matter of great difficulty and the traffic police have their work cut out.  We passed Albert and then came on various ruined villages until we reached Fricourt and Mametz where such fierce fighting was in progress last time we were here. Nature is kind and mercifully hides the scars made on the face of the country.  The splintered and torn woods, where thousands of shells have crashed and torrents of blood flown have now grown a thick green underbrush which touches the lower boughs of the stumps.  The thousands of shell holes are being welded together by a carpet of green grass and craters are less noticeable.  As we pushed on all the ground we marched over was land that had been wrested from the Germans and the drainage from the roads was being led into their old trenches.  Towards the end of the march there were many checks and halts and we passed</p>
