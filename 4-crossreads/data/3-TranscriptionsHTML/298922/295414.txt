<p>Climate lovely now.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  Just recd. your Cable of Congratulations. All's well for which many thanks. I hope you get my letters even if later than in the post.</p>
<p>I am not saying much about the GAZA Battle it is still sub judice. Another Gun boat just passed full steam ahead. Several Monitors are helping &amp; our Infantry are dug in. Reinforcements reached the Turks&amp; they are holding out.</p>
<p>My troubles last night were caused by Field Mice burrowing near my face &amp; covering my head with sand kicked up by their little hind legs. A light dazzles them &amp; they stand quite still &amp; stare.</p>
