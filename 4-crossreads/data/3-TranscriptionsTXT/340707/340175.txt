27-6-1947To night visited Montmartre - Cafe du Neant. Here there are coffins for tables & as each enters a funeral dirge is set up. Choose your coffin to right or to left [indecipherable] everything is black & everyone addressed as Moribund.
After a while the taper which was given to you on entering dies out & you are dead. The lights go out & a purple ghastly light fills room from a glass tube. Pictures are then shown on wall which change before your eyes eg a picture of Messina & then earthquake & fire consuming the building & then above the ruins Death with his scythe.
The dance at Bal Tabarin with the figure of all turning to skeletons. We then pass through narrow & vaulted passages illuminated if at all by green ghastly lights. This passage leads into a vault where we are shown one of the audience transformed into a skelon - very well done as the face becomes very waxy & ghastly before the transformation
Then through outer vaulted to a churchyard where the seats are all tombs - Here on the stage revels are held - a fairy strips herself all but her chemise & after this we are sent out & told to let the moral sink in. The only moral I could see is dont die.
From here Madelon & I
