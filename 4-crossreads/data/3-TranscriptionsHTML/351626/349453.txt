<p>it represents a drought here, but we would like several just now.  I had several letters from Marg's friend Miss  Hamilton at Abbey Wood Camp near Woolwich   &amp; she called to see me but the guard did not let her in   &amp; as I left very suddenly, will unfortunately miss seeing her as it is a long way from here to London.<br/>Goodbye for the present  love to all specially yourself<br/>from your affectionate son<br/>Charlie</p>
