<p>I started this in the YMCA hut, &amp; will finish it in bed so excuse pencil. The said YMCA to us. They supply paper pen &amp; ink etc. and all sorts of games &amp; a piano wherever they can put one. They are a fine body &amp; do a lot of washing for the soldiers wounded or otherwise. I sent you a cable a few days ago just to ease your feelings they are too expensive to send often. I gave yours &amp; Daves address to a particular friend of mine who is being invalided home his name is Serg. Heydon &amp; is a very fine chap who fought well at Gallipolli &amp; took his medicine like a man. So give him your best for my sake. Well mother I will close with fondest love to all from<br/>your loving son<br/>Ken</p>
