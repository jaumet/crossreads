<p>night.  It is very good.  Do not have much time for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Sunday 19th</p>
<p>Another week uneventfully passed.  Things have been quite slack not many men in camp.  Two or three drafts of 15 men on there way home have been here.  Our own camp is so empty that we have had Hun Prisoners on fatague several mornings.  They are hungry as they pick the scraps out</p>
