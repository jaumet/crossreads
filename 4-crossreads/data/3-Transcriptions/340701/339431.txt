<p>we left the north they were only Browning &amp; beginning to fall.  Amiens has a number of small canals running through it.  We passed along some fine Squares &amp; Streets.  While passing here we seen the sign "Defence D'Urinater"' on a gate in large letters.  The name of the village mentioned in the preceding page is Buire-sous-Corbie[?]<br/>Friday 27-10-16</p>
<p>We marched a mile further on yesterday &amp; are now in camp.  It was raining when we arrived &amp; the Boys raided a Haystack about &frac12; mile away for straw to sleep on.  we had just bedded it down when we got orders to return it &ndash; very nice.  Very muddy here. We are about 1&frac12; miles from Albert.  Plenty of German prisoners working on the roads here.  Mostly men of fine physique.</p>
<p>Saturday 29-10-16<br/>Church parade today.  Raining mud everywhere.  I have a Gum Boil &amp; sore foot.  I have been told by men in the first line that they could see our big shells passing over head to burst in the enemies trenches a little further on.</p>
