<p>Nothing else of any importance transpired so will set to &amp; write some letters</p>
<p>1.2.16<br/>Had a very busy day numbering &amp; fixing harness in order to be ready to meet <strike>all</strike> anything that may come along.<br/>Oscar Josephson came along to see me to-day &amp; I was very pleased to see him. Rupert Josephsons Regiment moves down to Tel-el-Kebir to-morrow so I will have to say good bye to him which I hate to have to do, as it may prove impossible to get him transferred to this Company.<br/>I am going into Cairo to-morrow night with O.J. &amp; will have a good time as it is the first time I have <strike>not</strike> been in for some time.</p>
<p>2.2.16<br/>Went into Cairo &amp; had a nice evening. Heard that the Persic was rumoured in Sydney to have been sunk.  If I do not soon get some Letters I will send another Cable.<br/> I returned to camp with R Josephson &amp; Oscar Josephson at 10 pm &amp; had some trouble with a man on Guard (Allen.)   I had to put him in the Motor Car, take him to the Dr in the 5th Training Bat..</p>
