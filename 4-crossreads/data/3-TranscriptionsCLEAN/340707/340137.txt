 I visit Alcocks in the afternoon & then dine with Miss Rose Richards 38 Hyde Park Gates near Albert Hall. Here the party consists of 2 other Lieutes from USA though in RAF & Ralston from Sydney. We play poker & at last hand I wage all & end up by losing 5/-. 
 This is night of Savage Ball at Albert Hall & there are rows of taxi & a good crowd of people even at this time (midnight) to watch the costumes. I try to cross Hyde Park but this is closed at 12. Fancy closing our domain at 12 for Hyde Park has nothing valuable in it like the Gardens. These people are not as civilised as Sydney. The Tubes also stop at 12 & there are none which run an all night service. 
 5-6-19 Orders to move have arrived & I start to morrow - 6.45 am. I rush about pricing clothes but afraid to buy lest I should be stranded in Paris, though I know clothes will cost almost double in Paris. 
 My pay book is taken from me & an account will be opened in Paris at Lloyd Bank. I am again at Chinese restaurant & after that get my luggage from Paddington to Victoria whence the train starts. 
 I meet Evans on my  back  road home & yarn for an hour
