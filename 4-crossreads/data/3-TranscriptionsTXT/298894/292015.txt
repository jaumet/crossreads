"Scoring Well"How often from the tented slopesIn summer we've acclaimedThe stalwart drive that topped the ropes,The wrist stroke neatly aimed!How long the bowlers trained each nerve,Before a wicket fell;While waiting wires received the news,Australia scoring well.
How oft in winter's day gone by,We've heard the crows acclaim,The swift low pass, the brilliant trip,The hard but sporting game.The while across the world there leaptBrief messages to tellAnother triumph for all Blacks;New Zealand scoring well.
And now when greater games are playedAnd greater deeds are done,Where sing the bullet & the bladeBeneath the Eastern Sun.More welcome to the Homeland flashThe messages that tellAustralians & New ZealandersContinue scoring well.
