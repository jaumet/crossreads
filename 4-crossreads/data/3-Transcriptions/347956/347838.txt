<p>services of a guide, hired a motor-car for 10/- to run us out to the pyramids<br/>had our photos taken sitting on camels  they cost us 4/- each for two photos &amp; had the Sphinx &amp; Pyramids for a background.  I enquired for Morgan Welch but saw no one that knew him.  Came back to Cairo &amp; had a bath at Shepheards Hotel &amp; dinner at the Obelisk (4) had a fine days outing &amp; climbed right over the pyramids &amp; it is a pretty stiff climb &amp; arrived back in camp on the 10.30 train</p>
<p>every night one of the lads that sleep in this tent come home drunk &amp; want to fight the rest.  fortunately Stan &amp; I sleep outside &amp; enjoy the arguments without taking part in them; &amp; the best of it is the same men only get drunk every 3 or 4 nights &amp; they take it turns to break the monotony</p>
