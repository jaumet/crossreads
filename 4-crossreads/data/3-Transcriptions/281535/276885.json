<p>19/3/16<br/>Marcinelle<br/>Absolutely damall to do. Went round and saw General Martin about quotas and other things and then wrote and read till lunch. After lunch had a bath at Charleroi station and then went up the town and met Tommy Roberts. Messed and then took a Berlitz lesson and went round and saw Bertrand.</p>
<p>20/3/19<br/>Attended a lecture by one sharp Victorian Immigration Expert in London and then went and saw General Martin about some odd matters. The afternoon read wrote and went up the street after mess taking a Berlitz lesson. The wooden sabots are in universal use here and are clumsy &ndash; the average price appears about 4 francs. Dancing is a hobby <strike>whe</strike> with the troops now.</p>
