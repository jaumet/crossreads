<p>April &amp;  May 1916<br/>On the 29th I received answers to the first mail which I sent home. We had to fall in at 7 am on the morning of the 30th &amp; was sent to the trenches on fatigue &amp;  was working till 12.30 at midnight &amp; we arrived back at our billets worn out &amp; fatigued. On the night of the 3rd of May we took over the trenches from the 1st Battalion &amp; my platoon No 4 was put in supports on guards &amp; ration fatigue work. We were also told about the Germans who several nights put a placard out in front of their trenches saying "That it is a disgrace insult to the German Army for them to have to fight the Australians who are a low down lot of <strike>bludgers</strike> criminals, thieves &amp; murderers" &amp; one of the 1st Battalion Sergeants went out the next night &amp; brought the board in &amp; our interpreter answered by writing on the placard "That we are all that we are cold footed afraid of lead &amp; steel come over &amp;  take our trenches" It was hear that I found out I had to stand to arms morning &amp; evening &amp; on the evening of the 5th we had to stand to for three hours as there was a gas attack  &amp;  bombardment by the Aleins on our left. It was the second Division of Australian who received the attack &amp; they met the Germans half way between the trenches &amp; drove them back &amp; took their position. During the afternoon of the 7th our platoon relieved No 2 platoon in the firing line &amp; that night I was detailed as one of a covering party over other who had to fix wire entanglements. <strike>Whe</strike> Just after taking our position outside the parapet &amp; began work we received orders to retire as the Welsh Fusaliers we going to give a bomb</p>
