 6.  And as for finding out when mails go to Australia, I might almost as well try &amp; find out where the "Australia" is! By the way I had a note yesterday from Gwen Bateman to say that they are off the Khartum on Monday to supply for someone for six months there, so that is another packing up for them.  I am sorry for personal reasons for it was nice to think that they were just down in Cairo to fall back on if I needed them.  However it must be meant to be so. Well dear Father &amp; Mother I had better close this letter perhaps &amp; be off to bed.  I have slept splendidly each night till last night when it was so fearfully rowdy as to  perev  prevent one till rather late &amp; as I prophesied weeks back I fell to thinking of sweet little balcony corner &amp; if only I could grab my special possession here &amp; keep him I'd fly off back to-morrow.  Still I'm sure to sleep through to-night I'm more accustomed to my new home, &amp; when once I get into regular work I'll be healthily tired at night &amp; nothing will keep me awake. I do hope you are all well there.  I have not written to dear old Wallie, feeling that he would almost certainly be gone, but if he isn't do give him great loads of love from me, won't you?  My telephone no here is 13 please ring me up soon! So very much love dear People, &amp; most loving wishes for the New Year. Your affectionate Egyptian daughter Zeytoun. P.S.  Have written to Capt. Hammond, Paymaster at Cairo.  Probably the Y.W.C.A. Victoria House, Alexandria may be my permanent postal address.  It is only about 7 or 8 minutes walk from here and in case I should move from here it will save delay.  OLO.
