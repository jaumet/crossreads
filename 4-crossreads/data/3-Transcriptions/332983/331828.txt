<p>28/10/1915<br/>A quite morning, fine weather again, inclined to be warm. Flies terrible. Nothing doing in the trenches. The Saddler, a Bdr and myself bought some potatoes and tomatoes from the S.M. Indian Mule Corps. He has to go over to Tenedos every week for vegetables for the Indians. The authorities had to cut out their meat not on account of the price, although it is high  &pound;4 for an Indian sheep but on account of disease. The French wagon line alongside of ours moved yesterday to a position further forward. It took them all day to do it. The Vet officer and Farrier of the 6th Battery are at logger heads. Had a real good row. The Vet threatened to get him reduced. All started over shoeing. The 13th Battery R.F.A. getting hell shelled out of them, one wagon blown to pieces. One shot over tonight from Asia at 7 P.M.<br/>29/10/1915<br/>Two 4.7 time shrapnels over 7 A.M. Dull morning, mild, Our</p>
