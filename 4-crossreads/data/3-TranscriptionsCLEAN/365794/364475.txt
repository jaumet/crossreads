  
 Thursday 14 March 1917 [1918] Letter from Marge, veils received & ink not Kodak paste. Cobs is now a "sister". Miss Conyers is in Egypt, came on last boat. Life is very trying these days, worry from home, no work in the wards & except for C. Grant not a congenial soul to work through the long day with.
