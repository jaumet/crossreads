<p>This objective secured, a second barrage will take place, &amp; the second wave of infantry will again move forward over the area controlled by this barrage. The third &amp; final barrage will take place about 9.30 am.   It will isolate the third section of the Enemys lines &amp; our infantry will advance at 10 am. The barrage will be maintained for some time so that our position may be consolidated.  Altogether we expect to advance 1,500 yards over a frontage of about 15 miles.</p>
<p>Our way lay through Ypres, which we reached at 3.30 pm. I secured several pictures of our forces camped in small dugouts excavated in the surrounding  ramparts. We took the car through the Menin Gate as far as [blank] from where further transport is inadvisable; the Menin road beyond this point being enfiladed &amp; at uncertain intervals heavily shelled.</p>
