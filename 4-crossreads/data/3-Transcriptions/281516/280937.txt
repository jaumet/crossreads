<p><u>Halfway House</u></p>
<p>30/6/16</p>
<p>Went into Armentieres for tea, overhead passed 15 aeroplanes in open formation heading for Lille &ndash; a great sight. Funny old dame at the eating house "Voici in sien merci meceir" drawing out the syllables greatly.So polite.</p>
<p>Hunter and Fussell both wounded. One man's body was not brought back, a 2" mortar blew it into a thousand fragments. It was a haunting night blood &amp; pain. The reaction on the men was very remarkable and two were removed in a state of alcoholic coma. Next stunt I am saw this the curse of our army will be unavailable. Our men wasted little time with prisoners killing them ruthlessly if any trouble was expected from them hanging back nervousness.</p>
<p>Poor Carwick after his dreadful journey lugging the dead was quite unnerved &amp; I had to put him to bed grimacing like a child, This, the slashing Viking who a few hours before led his men right in killing right and left. The signallers were buried in their dugout and took a lot of getting out. Until I came along no one thought of digging them out. I heard one was dead.</p>
<p>The fellows get callous &ndash; dropping a stretcher with a dead man in a trench and sitting round arguing the point about it. We got out of the trench and wandered across country.</p>
<p>Our telephones worked well. I was in direct communication right through, I even [indecipherable] our men were in the German trenches where they rigged up a line. The pocketbooks our men brought back had some photos of very pretty girls in them.</p>
<p>Hunter was quite distressed when he returned &ndash; almost raving. So does excitement work on some natures. Thank God for a cool head. I was able to talk to the artillery all the time as well as converse with our men in the German trenches.</p>
