<p>on passing some buildings I came across a Private house where a bomb had dropped alongside the front wall.   This place was three storey high &amp; the Front Wall from the roof to the ground was blown down &amp; the different floors left standing.   The 2nd floor was a Bedroom &amp; there were 3 large beds &amp; a child's cot &amp; a Wardrobe &amp; was hardly damaged at all, there were several people in this building but were only slightly injured &amp; 3 Tommies standing close by were hit &amp; badly injured, each receiving a Blighty.   I continued on until we came to the Wharf were a number of Armed Motor Launches were moored after a few minutes chat with the Jack Tars we kept going &amp; passed <strike>through</strike> over another Swing Canal Bridge, &amp; on to another Wharf were we saw some Monitors Anchored.   They all looked splendid &amp; had some big guns on board &amp; the Jack Tars were all busy working except a few who were lined up two deep ready for their Afternoon's leave.   We had an interesting chat with two of the boys exchanging experiences on the Sea &amp; on land we continued on until we came to the Sand Hills &amp; soon was interested watching a number of Aeroplanes flying about &amp; performing some wonderful feats such as diving, looping the loop, &amp; volplaning down.   We walked over to the beach were we saw the Barb Wire entanglements to prevent the Enemy landing, we laid down on the grass chatting to two Wireless Sailor Boys &amp; watching</p>
