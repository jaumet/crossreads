Dear Sir,
Will you please have names shown on this letter added to your list.  Mr. Gray suggests the presenting of "Colours" to the 20th on our returns;  from the people of Albury.  Will you get in touch with him please?
Your son is in excellent health & has greatly improved as a leader.  He should get another star shortly.  I have already recommended it.  Col. Lamrock is sick in Cairo & may not rejoin us.  Major Jenkins is in command (temporary) & I am 2nd in command (temporary).  We are at Lemnos & should be in the trenches within 24 hours.  So far our men are in fine form & all anxious to fight.
Sincerely yrs.R.F. Fitzgerald20.8.15
