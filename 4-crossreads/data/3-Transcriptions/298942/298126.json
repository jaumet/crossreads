<p>Saturday 11 May</p>
<p>Was on stretcher squad yesterday but did not get more than a few cases.  We are only evacuating from the Borre &amp; Strazeele areas now as the English have taken over Castre &amp; Meteren.  Our A.D.S. run by the 1st Field Ambulance is at Borre which is being shelled just as badly as Castre I believe.</p>
<p>From rumours to official reports I have got clear idea now what happened when the Germans were finally held up here</p>
