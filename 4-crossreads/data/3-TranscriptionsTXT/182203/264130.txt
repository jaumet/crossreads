These patients stay longer, so have a lot of long medical ones to nurse. No rush but a fearful lot of nursing. Thank goodness they are quieter to-night. Usually have a couple of hundred to look after but only 105 to-night & very good Orderlies on, so am making time to write to you . I have ordered a new Kit-bag & camp bath from England. My carryall is not much good, must have some-thing more suitable to pack my bed etc in. Travelling about one's trunks etc must be handy. The French people must be very dirty, fancy no bath-room in any of the houses we occupy, so we all need camp-baths.
