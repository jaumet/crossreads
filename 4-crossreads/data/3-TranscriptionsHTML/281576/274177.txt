<p>Sun. JAN. 21.  Quite a Busy day.  After Break a party of us sorted out some old Tents; &amp; loaded the old stuff from the Salvage Dump on to Waggons.  Cleared a space to pitch a Tent for a Pack store.  After Dinner we pitched the Tent &amp; carted a lot of old stretchers from the Incinerator to the Dump.  Peter Murphy came to see me.  He is in the 8th Mac. Gunnrs &amp;amp looks very well on it.  First time I've seen him since Egypt.  Showed him my snaps &amp; gave him one as I had two alike.   2 of the 14th &amp; 1 of the 15th were wounded today, also one of our horses.</p>
<p>Mon. 22.  Told off last night to go out with a Party to where they are building the new A.D.S.  We turned out at 6 &amp; it was jolly cold.  Had Break &amp; started off about 7.30.  Serg. Jeffreys was in charge.  It is about 4 miles away from our Billets &amp; the walk through the frosty air was most enjoyable. From Eskimo Dump the Engineers loaded us with roofing Iron &amp; Timber. We split up into parties of 6 with about 100 yds interval between each party as Fritz drops his shells around pretty strong in these parts. We got out to the A.D.S. about 9.30. Bert Hunt &amp; I with 2 15th chaps carted duck boards from a dump about a mile away. Had Dinner at 11.30. Couldn't light a fire as Fritz would have spotted our smoke. While we were eating Fritz dropped about 20 shells all within a 100 yds radius. One dropped on the top of a dugout belonging to the Artillery. It caught one chap in  the head &amp; splashed his brains about a bit. Serg. Jeffreys &amp; I went over &amp; fixed him up  &amp; Bert Hunt, Sullings, Tom Davis &amp; I pulled him along to the A.D.S. on a trolley. It must be about 5 miles &amp; snowed very heavily.   Bomr. Macdonald. 52  Battery.</p>
<p>Tues.23. Beautiful sunshiny day. Clear as crystal. Fritz had his aeroplanes up bright &amp; early. Our A.A. Guns gave them a lively reception &amp; brought one down.</p>
