<p>Monday 25th December.<u>Xmas day</u> my third in the Army, the last being spent at Lemnos. On the 23rd we left our station at Bernafay Wood &amp; came in by train to "Meaulte" where we picked up a "Chara-banc" which put us down at the Mill in "Ribemont" a very decent billet indeed. Next day hunted round &amp; bought a goose for 38 francs also some vegetables &amp; gave a woman 8 francs to cook it which she did very well. As our parcels did not arrive in time for Xmas, a very grave error on someones part, we had to buy cakes, puddings etc. We went to "Corbie" for wines &amp; bought about 16 bottles at a cost of 85 Francs &amp; taken all round our Christmas dinner was a great success considering our short time to prepare. At night a few of us visited the 1st Field who were having their dinner at night. We timed our arrival after their meal</p>
