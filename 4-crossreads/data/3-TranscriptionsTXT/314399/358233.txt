 Sunday 24 August 1919 Stomach upset. Will have to take some Gregory's. It doesn't take much to put a color on my tongue these days. Think I want a lot of football. Read today &amp; did a bit of printing. All my photos of Cape Town turned out well. Feel upside down tonight. Just can't be bothered doing anything. 
 Monday 25 August 1919 See the coast all day. Saw a few farms. Very little of the ground tho was cultivated. The majority of it looked very bare with trees &amp; shrubs here &amp; there &amp; plenty of rocks. Nice big breeze. Read all day. Played a few hands of rummy &amp; sevens after dinner.
