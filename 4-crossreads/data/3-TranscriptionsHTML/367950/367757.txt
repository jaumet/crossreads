<p>2nd January 1917 El Arish Tuesday &#126;<br/>Cold wind blowing all night and much drift sand. Our aeroplanes went out this morning in a high wind to reconnoitre and probably bomb "Jacko" up at Rafa. The latest information to hand is that there is increased enemy activity at Rafa. Some one suggested that the Turks were going to attempt to recapture El Arish. If that is the case there <u>will</u> be increased enemy activity. "Jacko" will be very active getting back again.<br/>All day long there has been blowing a fierce wind with fine drift sand which simply smothers every thing we look like dustmen. And the cold is something to remembered too I have to make periodical excursions outside and shovel the soft sand off the roof of my dug-out otherwise in a short while I could be inundated. No wonder cities get buried We have several large pieces of stone at the cook house to rest the dixies on and these are a kind of marble and have been cut for building purposes. Where they came from in the first place what buildings they were intended for and how that got to such a barren sandy place etc remains a mystery.</p>
