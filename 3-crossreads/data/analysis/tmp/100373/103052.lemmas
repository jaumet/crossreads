 This man had been in London for three year . He was a Syrian . He said that he had tri our principl here but had found it of no use . He put up a notic to the effect that all his articl had one price and one price onli . The result was , no sale the first day , no sale the first week , no sale for the month , so he gave it up in disgust and conform to the custom of the other merchant in the bazaar and practis the bargain principl . Another man we came across , a big , bur fellow seat outsid the door of a brasswar shop , engrav a larg brass plate . He broke into convers with us as we stood watch him at his work . He told us , a parti of three we were , our correct age much to our amaz . In convers with him we learn that he had been in London . He had made his livelihood there as a conjuror and he prove to us that he was a conjuror by do a few trick with a coin . As we left him he gave us a hearti invit to come back again . There is one thing about these men , they are veri , veri , shrewd . They have a fine persuas manner with them . It is pretti difficult to express in word the fascin of these bazaar . Person I have never enjoy anyth better . I have met chap who felt like myself in this respect
