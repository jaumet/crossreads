 My Dear Mum, 
 Just these few lines to you and Dad, hoping that you are well and happy. I am still in the Hospital yet, but I am getting on fine I am up out of bed all day. We have a concert room here, as big as the King's and a couple of times a week we have proper Vaudeville Artists come and amuse us and they are really good 
 I have been Motor driving and to afternoon parties to different places and enjoyed myself top hole. The girls are simply lovely, they look after us in lots of ways I have about 9 girls writing to me and  They  they come to the Hospital to see me. They have a very good opinion of us Australians 
 Their are about 150 Australians in this place and we are  about  the only Australians they have seen, so we have a good time I went to a  parties  party on last Saturday (10th Oct) to a little village on the bank of a river and watched a lot of sports and then had tea and some Music &amp; singing and left to come home at about 6 oclock &ndash;
