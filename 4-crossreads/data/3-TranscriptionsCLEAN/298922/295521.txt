The Prickly Pears are ripe now, bigger than the Q'land ones, but not bad eating if you can dodge the hair like spines. Natives make a meal of them. The middle is like a POMEGRANATE all seeds. Although the middle of summer the plains are covered with green couch grass, good enough to lamb on. Here we take our Horses 5 miles to water & 5 back. No attempt to put a bore down or any modern water improvements.
