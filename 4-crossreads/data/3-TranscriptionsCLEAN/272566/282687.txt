Raining all day.Only one trip - to 1st Anzac Corps. Hd. Q.Joe Connell died in B2 Ward No. 17 C.C.S. this afternoon just as I was entering the door to see him.  He was wounded through the abdomen.  Our boys had been relieved and this squad were about to carry a patient down with them when a shell burst close by.  This chap carried with me when I was in the stretcher-bearers, he at one end of the stretcher & I at the other end.  His name appears elsewhere in this diaryCards after tea
