just the thing for walking, on our way out we passed the 1st T.B.s draft for France going to Warminster headed by a piper.
29th. When I woke up this morning hanged if it wasn't raining steadily never saw such a country in my life you can't tell 2 hours in advance what the weather is going to be.
The old war is taking some dramatic turns nowadays nobody can tell what is going to happen from day to day its easily to be seen that a master hand is at work if ever a man has justified the confidence placed in him well old Foch has, he has pulled this war out of the fire with a vengeance for no doubt when he took things over we were in a very bad state far worse than the general public have any idea of.
