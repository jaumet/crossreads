<p>Revielle as usual.</p>
<p>Today is the day of the sports given by the Miedian &amp; although it was nice &amp; cool it was marred by the dust which blew down the course continually, they started off with horse dancing by the omdahs &amp; the nags were splendid next came the 150 yds foot race we had four lads in for it &amp; got 1st 2nd 3rd &amp; 4th, the troopers 6 furlong flutter was next &amp; it proved an great race we again had 4 representatives &amp; got 1st with a chestnut from 2nd Regt, 2nd with a HQ's horse, 3rd with old Lempriere &amp; 4th with Bill Mustard. Tent pegging followed &amp; gippo trapper got first, us second with Sgt Earle, they had a camel race after that &amp; although interesting was rather dangerous to the onlookers for the animals were not at all particular where they ran, had a bath after the sports &amp; later went for a stroll up town.</p>

<p>7 May, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Reveille at 5 as usual</p>
<p>Had a quiet day after yesterday I wrote letters this morning to fill in time Capt Chisholm has not got over his defeat yet &amp; is not likely to either for the boys are not going to let him forget. Strolled down the boulevarde after tea &amp; discussed future plans for home &amp; the cattle question had pride of place &amp; is likely to have a long run too. Received parcel from Dunck containing writing pads &amp; envelopes galore, 3 pads, 2 handkerchiefs &amp; a pair of socks, one of the best parcels I've received for some time. Gen Cox was sent to No 3 General Hospital today ill he has been off color for some days now &amp; is recommended for a holiday; the old horse is looking none the worse for her run yesterday &amp; I hope to get her back again shortly. The Telegraph line has been giving trouble again today.</p>
<p>Turned in at 10.30</p>
