December 1915Sunday 12Fine. Enemy fired some heavy high explosive shells on our trenches today but no casualties resulted. The enemy search over our back trenches with large shrapnel bombs but seldom do any damage. They also sweep Allah and Cooee gullies at night as our patrols often go down them.
Monday 13Dull    A strong breeze sprang up from south early this morning. The Navy still bombard heavily at the cape. This is the eighth day but we cannot get any news as to the doings there. Our men put out more wire last night.
