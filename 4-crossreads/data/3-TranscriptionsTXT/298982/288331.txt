Sun 8th Woke early big gun fire & the general circus Then 3 shells came close to our possie & burst below woke the boys up. They became more frequent & close & one drove several loads of earth just on to my late bed. Then we bolted for it. Place thick with smoke & dust. Wandered homeless till 9 when we went back & had some tucker. Discovered they were 75 m/m shells percussion. 11 dead still in Mortuary. Did a fair round in morn. Mac on Morty. Saw Capt Tan 2.30. All serene. Up to Walker's Ridge Met Cheval. Reckons things going fair to good on left. Jack Clark & self to summit for look at scene. Great. Ambulance busy. Many ships all sorts. Guns along beach. Sapping on
