 1917 JANUARY 
 8 MONDAY 
 Fine, but very cold & it rained a bit 
 in the evening. We had a full 
 dress mounted turn out in morning 
 & marched about three miles out 
 & back. Generals Monash & Grimwade 
 inspected us. I was feeling very 
 crook I had a sleep in the 
 afternoon. Warren & I came up 
 as usual to our old billets 
 for tea.
