Guns fireing at a German Taube Machine which was very high up in the Air looked to the naked Eye like a spec. The High Explosive Shells bursting all around it. The Taubes are soon driven back over their lines. Wednesday. 13/6/17
All day long a lot of the boys were busy unloading Material from the trucks building a Telephone Room also a Blacksmith Shop others continued building places to have their meals on, all sorts of boards were brought in, some where doors which they made use as tables pieces of Canvas from everywhere were put up for shade during the afternoon I had a rest after I had Tea I took a stroll into the Town of Poperingie about 2 Miles away. Our Camp lies in about 100 yds from the Main Road. This Road is made of Square stones blocks very hard to walk on, it is an everlasting Road I believe it continues on to Brussels, as we are now some miles in Belgium the People all speak Flemish we can understand them better than we did in France. The Traffic along the Road is very heavy consisting of Motor Wagons
