<p>Sunday, 7 February, 1915<br/>Church parade as usual C. of E. minister very popular.  I had a lot of friends out to see me in the p.m., English and those that had arrived in the 2nd contingent.  A lot of our men are suffering from a kind of sore throat that goes septic.  The Turkish prisoners captured on the canal are arriving at Cairo daily.  One of the fugitives that escaped was caught by a Territorial in town to-day.  The prisoners state that they are sick of the German Officers and are deserting whilst their officers are shooting them down like dogs.  Desertions are very frequent.</p>
<p>Monday, 8 February, 1915<br/>The L.H. Brigade went out for a sham fight and bivouacked at night so far we the L.H. Amb bearers are having a fine holiday, we only go out for rides over the desert and surrounding places and are seeing the sights of Egypt that would cost a total of &pound;3 a week for expenses only.  The drivers on the other hand do waggon drill all day long the wounded from the canal are expected to-day and will go to the hospital in Heliopolis.</p>
<p>Sammy has turned a real bad little devil and is becoming worse every day.  He went mad for about five minutes to-day &amp; bucked &amp; reared.  I ride him one day &amp; Mary his mate the next.</p>
