<p><u>The Vital Drafts</u></p>
<p>More Queenslanders are yet required&nbsp;<s>as reinforcements most urgently needed in fact,</s>&nbsp;to don the colour of glory - Khaki &amp; a sympathetic encouragement to the promptings of this Patriotism, will create the proper frame of mind in that section of civil eligibles, whom the public consider slid&nbsp;<s>Volunteer to enlistors</s>&nbsp;supply the&nbsp;<s>necessary</s>&nbsp;vital drafts.</p>
<p><s>Complement of Education</s></p>
<p><strike>The tute to England</strike></p>
<p>The Queensland Recruiting Committee on many occassions have emphasised, as an enducement&nbsp;<s>to men</s>&nbsp;to enlist, the great advantages of a free&nbsp;<s>trip</s>&nbsp;voyage to Europe.&nbsp;<s>on active service</s>. I can commend that as the best material argument&nbsp;<s>that</s>&nbsp;<s>where</s>&nbsp;when persuasian is necessary to encourage men to volunteer. The education began by the State is extended by the trip,&nbsp;<s>or a trip can be considered as the complement of State Education.</s></p>
