<p>Bank London that the &pound;10, cabled by you was there at my disposal.  I haven't been able to get to the Old Country yet but hope to do so before I return to Australia.  Thank you so much Father dear for replying to the cable so promptly   If I could have known how things have turned out I certainly shouldn't have asked for it just yet.<br/>I met Jocelyn once not long ago, but we were very busy at the time &amp; I couldn't spare <strike>my</strike> much time.  He is in the 5th F. Amb. &amp; one of the Medical Officers is Captain Clem Chapman whom you will probably remember at the S.H.S.  I caught sight of him the other day but so far have not been able to see him to speak to.<br/>Thank you so much for sending out the blank paper &amp; envelopes.  The former is scarce here now &amp; you see I am making use of some you have sent.  I would like you to continue sending the paper, please but not the envelopes as now &amp; again we are issued with the Green Envelopes otherwise our letters have to be censored by our O.C.<br/>There are incidents &amp; adventures I could tell you about if I was permitted, but I must refrain until I get back.  I have some interesting German souvenirs with me &amp; if only I can hang on to them till I get back they will be very interesting to you at home.<br/>I am keeping in splendid health, &amp; in fact haven't had</p>
