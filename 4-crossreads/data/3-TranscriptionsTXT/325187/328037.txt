 [Saturday 21 October 1916] 
 Went to Arnside Cottage &amp; to see Doll's Grandmother an old woman of 80. You will be glad to hear that Father &amp; Mother are now friends again &amp; Dollys marriage has brought them together. Laura is at Walsall but comes down to the Boarding House on Tuesday. Australian Headquarters are in a low part of London down a dirty bye street filled with Costers barrows etc, not an elevating quarter to employ girls in.
