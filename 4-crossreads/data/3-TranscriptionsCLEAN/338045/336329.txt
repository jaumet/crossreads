  
 have tea in Sergeants' mess receive two blankets, take a walk back to 4th Div. B.D. & talk the situation over.  Decide to see it out.  Turn it at 9 p.m.  This camp is for details, Artillery, A.S.C., A.M.C., Engineers, Pioneers, etc. & is fairly miserable. 
 Oct. 17th - Tuesday Cold & rainy.  Last night was the coldest of my experience & nearly frozen.  Two blankets!  Too much of this is not appealing.  Reveille 6 a.m. & parade 6-30 a.m., orders & then dismissed at 7 a.m.  After a good wash in icy water hands & face numbed.  Breakfast & at 9 a.m. parade.  I have to take charge of a section & march them on to the parade
