<p>Tues. 25-7-'16<br/>&amp; made for 3rd Found when pulled out to be almost gone. His legs broke under. By this time sufficient help with shovels in <indecipherable> spot to dig out remainder so I retd. to Cobber Charlie with great difficulty (He weighs 14 stone) we got him over <indecipherable> &amp; with Cpl Fraser's help (A boy's scouts) succeeded in restoring him to <indecipherable> <br/>Shells dropping all around. I took him out of trench because more shells dropping in than out of Trench &amp; it was full of men. A &amp; C Coy. occupied 100+ yds of it. Frank Sullivan &amp; Jack Salter helped to carry Charlie to 1st Dressing stn. Where his case was diagnosed as Shell Shock. I accompanied S.B.'s of F.A. Coy.</p>
