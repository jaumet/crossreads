15/10/16.
An early start, did a god 12 miles and billeted near the village of Aneeke. Passed a very picturesque village today, quite the prettiest I have ever seen called Cassel. It is perched high on a hill; and its quaint red roofs and towers make it look like the coloured pictures of fairy cities. Beside it is the ruin of a grand old castle. Its great thick walls still standing, and its towers covered with ivy. A very charming country altogether. Passeded the evening in town, a very good place for tucker, and other comforts; a pleasant day! A pleasant world! Returned to camp and got a new blanket; have two now; am going to doss on the grass tonight.
