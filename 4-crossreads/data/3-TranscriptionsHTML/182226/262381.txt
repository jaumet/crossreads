<p>Saturday 25 December, 1915</p>
<p>Had a first class dinner &amp; a beano in the tent after. We got a bottle of &quot;Scotch&quot; from the Sergeants Mess for 5/8. At about 4.30 we decided to go out so we took a trip to Mesieda [Msida], we were all nice &amp; merry when we started to drive home, about 4 miles, I was up on top of the Garry with the driver &amp; while we were going up a hill the horse slewed round &amp; upset the whole bally show. I had the farthest to fall but luckily nobody was hurt but I am keeping a bit of the broken garry as a suvenir. After that we had a real good supper&nbsp;&amp; half a dozen bottles of beer for luck. We had a right good time.</p>
