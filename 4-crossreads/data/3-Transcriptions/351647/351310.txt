<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Your letter No. 4 of Boxing Day reached me last night and I was very grieved to hear of your Father's death.  Of course he was not too good when we left &amp; Miss Hilda told he has was having a very bad time so I can understand in a way that he was glad to go &amp; that you all feel relieved to think his suffering is ended.  It is terrible to watch people one loves suffer &amp; <strike>not</strike> to be unable to relieve them.</p>
<p>Still it is a terrible loss &amp; I know how you will feel it &amp; I am so sorry &amp; wish I could do anything at all.  But I can't &amp; by the time this reaches you</p>
