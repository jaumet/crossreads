<p>a cross between a turtle &amp; a caterpiller is the best description of it: plenty of shells kicking about:</p>
<p>Wednesday Nov 8th  <br/>Trenches: showery day: plenty of shells: we give him a rough time alright: our feet are very wet &amp; swollen: we had a rough time with the cases after tea: Poor old Tom was sniped &amp; then killed by a shell: he was a good mate &amp; I am indeed sorry for his wife &amp; children:</p>
<p>Thursday Nov 9th  <br/>Trenches: fairly clear day: we took the opportunity of taking our boots off &amp; our feet swelled a lot: we had to take some of the boys down with their feet: the tank is a funny sight &amp; I had a good look as I passed only a few yards off it: there are plenty of dead laying about: death finds men in funny attitudes one here is sitting in the trench with a bible where he has been reading: 'planes were about galore &amp; &amp; some great duals took places as many as twenty being engaged at once: we seen a few come down: relieved about 10PM by the 19th : it was a rough time &amp; where we jumped in was where most stopped till relieved: I guided No 7 over to Bgde H.Q. &amp; we got a few shells as I got back &amp; patched them up: took some cases round to the dressing station &amp; then straggled home tired, weary,&amp; full up of everything concerning war: the rum kept us going alright in the trenches: taubes about at night again:</p>
<p>Friday Nov 10th  <br/>Carlton camp: got a feed &amp; turned in: we are in tents: fair day: up at noon: plenty of 'planes about &amp; seen some good duals: a few taubes came down: Fritz sent a few shells over: there were a few 'planes about again after tea: they were bomb dropping a few nights ago: the night was as bright as day: I am badly knocked up &amp; have a bad cold too:</p>
