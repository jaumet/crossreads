Behind our line there are many small graves some surrounded with barb wire and covered with green grass, small crosses on top denoting that they are bodies on men unknown.

Tried 5 cases and passed sentence. The MMP's told us they had received orders to be very respectful and chary in handling our Australian lads. They are lovely. To see the twinkle in the eye of some sunburnt hones Australian free and easy lad as he gives his evidence regarding a good night out or brawl he took part in, is good.
