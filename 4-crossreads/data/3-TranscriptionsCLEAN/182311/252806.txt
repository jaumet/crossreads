  7.           7 
 two hours late.  Instead of leaving town at 9.30 pm twas 11.30 pm & as the train crawled through the fog I did not see bed until 4.30 am to be rudely aroused by a voice saying "Hard Luck Harold but the Major says you are the only officer available for Orderly Officer so up I get & after 90 minutes sleep carry on with to-day's work.  I've got to wait up till  ten  10.15 pm tonight hence this long letter. 
    I discussed a few ideas & ambitions re any commercial future with M r  Clarke he says that there is every possibility of my doing well along those lines if after the war I am as able as I was before enlistment.  Sounds Good, Eh! 
    With all Love 
       Sincerely Yrs 
           Harold
