turned in (but was looking around about  hour finding the tent) slept like a top.
13/10/17 During the night Fritz shelled the camp but only damaged one tent ? no casualties. One big shell fell 20 yds from our tent splashed it with mud etc. Got up 8.30am had good breakfast have since been trying to dry some of my clothes but almost impossible on account of the rain. A heavy thunderstorm splashed over heavy hail fell. Very cold all day.
