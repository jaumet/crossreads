  
 A concert was given by the Bijou Orchestra & ASC. to the Engineers in honor of the competion coming to the Sharp end, otherwise the bow. The Orchestra played some very pretty Selections including the "Norwegian Cradle Song". There was also some good songs. It was attended by the A.S.C. & Engineers officers and men and we had a royal time. The fact of beating the Infantry at their own game was sufficient to make us happy. Toasts were given by the ASC officers & the Engineer officers heartily responded. In all it was a brilliant success and was enjoyed much better than those that are held down aft.  Mileage 264. 24th Weather still pleasant  The sea is dead calm in fact it is like a sheet of glass the only movement in it being made by the wash of the ship.
