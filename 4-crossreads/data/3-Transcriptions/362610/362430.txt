<p>Wednesday 2 August 1916<br/>Same weather. After breakfast moved down to Bde. H.Q., my new billet being merely a bare room without a stick of furniture, &amp; not too clean at that. Getting things straight generally during the morning : met Cousin Ray, now Transport Corporal to the Bde., who made himself known to me. In the afternoon rode round on a bike to see Divl. Gas Officer, &amp; on the way back met Rid who is quartered in St. Leger, the next town but one, &amp; was looking for me. Delighted to see him &amp; have a yarn, &amp; afterwards rode out with him to their bivouac, returning in time for dinner at night.</p>
