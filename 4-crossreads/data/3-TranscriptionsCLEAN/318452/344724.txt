  
 the bosch was driven back from the Somme front in July. The country is open undulating with villages & pretty woods here & there & is very pleasant. We are a considerable distance behind the lines but the rumble of guns can be distinctly heard and that has been particularly noticeable today & yesterday in the direction of Leus & Arras I am fairly comfortable in a tin shanty the rain comes in & flows in a stream across the mud floor but my bed is dry & my batman has made things fairly decent for active service Today there was another Brigade parade & though a bit cold it was a good parade Jessep gave the address a Standfast Hold the traditions of your Fathers etc I read the lesson It was too wintry for open service
