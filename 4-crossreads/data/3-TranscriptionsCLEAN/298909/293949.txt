  
 over & over again at not being paid, we were told could get it today & were disappointed - the whole of A & B Details - Artillery. A.S.C etc  are growling at no leave - no pay - bad tucker & short rations - about 9 pm they wrecked the wet Canteen & helped themselves to Tobacco & shicker. Chaos reigned supreme - Officers were useless - at last a strong guard were called out & kept the Boys in order - several free fights etc. The Officers got some plain talk, such as why the A.B.C. don't you give us some pay - tucker or leave.
