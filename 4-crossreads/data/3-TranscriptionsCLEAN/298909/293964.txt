  
 for hostile ships to fly over, a lot of our own are continually flying over. A.M.C. men doing some jobs about the Camp all day - About a dozen of us went for a swim after tea - this is the only chance one has of a wash. About 5.30 pm there was another Aeroplane alarm - every body rushed to their post - the Mechanics - run out with Telephone wires & attached to main Wires to advise etc - nothing eventuated - quite cold at night. 
 23/4/16  Sunday 
 Very hot - On fatigue work all day. Never got a chance to attend Church parade. 
 It takes our 2/- a day to keep up a decent supply of tucker - We had a good Easter Sunday dinner - Tinned Meat. Pineapples - Cherries - biscuits etc. 
 14th Reinforcements of 2nd L.H.F.A are cut right out & belong to nobody now. I had to pull down my stripes  they offered me acting, but I told them I have done too much already for nothing. The Prince of Wales was 1/4 of a mile from here yesterday. Had a good swim after tea.
