Saturday Jan 26. 1918.1272 day of the war and 14th and last day of my leave.It is dull and cloudy this morning. The weather during the past week has been remarkable fine for this time of year. This is Australia day and a man is selling wattle blossom on the street in front of the War Chest Club. He has a basketful of fine large yellow bunches the first I have seen since I left Victoria. It is today the 130 anniversary of the settlement of Australia.I am posting this diary to my wife today together with some post cards.
