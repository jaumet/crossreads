to be with them again. As far as I know this 3rd A.C.C.S. has not opened since we were bombed   &  shelled. the Staff are lent around at British C.C. Stations   &  some of them are not very happy,
five nurses left here yesterday-morn for C.C.S. work, unfortunately for me, my little Staff nurse, who is a great favourite with patients   &  an excellent worker. I miss her very much. To my surprise a British Sister was sent to help me - so we have four helping in our hospital. It is strange how they are mixing us. Anyhow she is a jolly nice girl   &  is very happy here - hopes she will be allowed to remain.
Kelly   &  I have not got our Leave yet, hope to be in London on
