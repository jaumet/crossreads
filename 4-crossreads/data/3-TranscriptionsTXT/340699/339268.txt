kindly to take a hand and patronisingly approve of the "works". This they did cheerfully though somewhat in the manner of Laodicea. I think they didn't know what to say. The jocund convener of this reunion of critics then informed me that "before I went I could "take" him. What a lout! The whole performance mortified me. He then proceeded to tell me that the C.R.E. wished to see me with regard to camouflage, so round I went to his office at the other end of the village. He proves to be John Mather's son Leslie; a very able and nice chap whom I know but, when I got there he was engaged.

It seemed all wrong that after living the whole of their lives in one place that that place should so change in character that though these aged dames believe they're on the old spot they really aren't. They've stayed, but the village hasn't. They and the cats have remained for the same reasons. After comparatively little trouble I found my objective. It turned out to be what I suppose was once a castle wall or rather one of the faces of a "butte" reinforced by being bricked. The dug-outs which the engineer officer reckoned
