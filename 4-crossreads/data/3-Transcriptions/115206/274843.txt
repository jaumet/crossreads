<p>In rear of Hargicourt, or Bellicourt. Weather fine; at 6.0 am our lads went across and captured their objectives, that could not be taken yesterday owing to insufficient art support,<br/>Had a further nightime from midnight to 4am. Heavy frost overnight, and a more than cold breeze which penetrated to the marrow. Had two trips on the forward line. Tom Code had been hemmed in by m.g. fire. Made our quarters in an old Fritz dugout past the Hindenburg Line. <br/>On two occasions today our guns were firing at 2800 with 71&deg;L 53&deg;L on.- rather risky</p>
