<p>Saturday Nov 30<br/>The last week or so there has been nothing of interest to write. We have built a Divisional Race course with stand &amp; Steeplechase track. All the good horses are in training for the coming Divisional Races which promises to provide a good days sport. First day Race Meeting. Second day Children's &amp; Divisional sports. The kiddies of Richon are delighted at the prospect. We have had several inspections by our OC in preparation for the inspection by Div, Corp Generals &amp; GOC. General Allenby.</p>
