23.3.15Tue. 23rd.  This morning we started from camp at 8.30 on a four days bivouac.  We went out on the desert & ran against the 2nd Contingent of L.H. from Maadi, & had a sham fight with them, it was hard work, but the umpires reckoned we had beat them, so we all rode into Maadi Camp together.  It was after sundown when we struck camp & had tea at seven thirty we were all about knocked up & felt in no humor to parade the streets of Maadi but were under the blankets as soon as we had finished tea.
