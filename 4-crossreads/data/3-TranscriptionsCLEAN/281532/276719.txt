 we must move off again to a place near Nauroy. This was particularly annoying as the boys had gone to a lot of pains to dig their bivouacs but they did not growl and just carried on splendidly. It was getting dark and the ground was all new to us. It was covered with obstacles - barbed wire, the Hindenburg Line and a great Canal and was devoid of landmarks. There followed a demonstration of just what the trained man can do with a compass at night. H Smith took a bearing on a copse called Billiard Copse which we could see 3 miles away and we marched on this bearing in the dark and ended up exactly at the copse. Here we were well bombed by enemy 'planes and searchlights were very fine but no casualties resulted. Our guides had very little time to do
