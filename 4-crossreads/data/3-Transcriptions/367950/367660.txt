<p>There has been a good wind blowing all day and tonight the temperature is rather cooler than usual. Mather has got to do stableman again tomorrow for not doing what he was told today as a punishment. He is rather sore about it, but instead of doing what he was told re cleaning the lines he sat about playing cards, Lance Corporal Campbell arrived at SALMANA by train from Kantara tonight but we could not send a horse for him as no horses are allowed off the line after dark out in these regions  There are outposts and picquets out in all sort of inconceivable positions at night and they know<br/>that they should not be any prowling horsemen roaming about the desert after dark and they might be tempted to use the old saying " shoot 1st and challenge after" So we shall send over to Salmana first thing in the morning &ndash; and in daylight.<br/>Campbell will probably have a cold bed for tonight but he may get worse. This particular HOD was lately tenanted by the 3rd L H Brigade and they have left a lot  (quite a lot) of little things behind them and these "little things" are hard to define against a grey flannel shirt and they have a bad habit of staying as long as they can. There is some sort of a rumour about shifting to a healthier and cleaner spot soon . I have not got any of these "little things" yet nor any of the signallers but some of the men have picked them up but whether they have picked them up here or whether they brought them along with  them is more than I can say.</p>
