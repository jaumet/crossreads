<p>aeroplanes about.  I saw one driven off in a great hurry by anti aeroplane guns &amp; also by 3 of our planes.  Later it or another one returned flying at a low altitude over the Hospital towards A. L. Epinette and fired on the observation baloon there.  The man in it jumped out in a parashoot and gently glided down to earth.  The aeroplane quickly turned round and again fired on the baloon.  It was then quickly hauled down but I believe it was hit by the machine gun fire from the enemy aeroplane.  It then made off and escaped.<br/>Harry Ryal formerly</p>
