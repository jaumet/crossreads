I was afforded an opportunity in March 1918 to visit Englands Bakeries with a dual object viz to study the methods in civil Bakeries and tender advice where necessary in Military Bakeries. The Bakeries in England I found to be slightly in advance of Australian methods of manufacture. Insomuch that larger Bakeries such as Lyons ? Brixton Cooperative, Manchester Coop, Coop Glasgow, McFarland Laings Glasgow have installed the latest appliances ? I saw the Gas heated Ovens automatic in Lyons and was impressed by it. In this Bakery they are continually on the alert to procure the latest labour saving appliances. The arrangements for packing and loading Bread are carried out on the principle of a maximum amount of labour at a minimum of cost 
The smaller Bakeries (which are being slowly but surely absorbed by the large Businesses) are not on a par with small Bakeries in Australia. It would be unfair to make comparisons re the finished article as Bakers were using standard Flour. The quick process of Fermentation is in favour. D.C.L. (Distillers Company) Yeast is very popular and justly so. I have yet to see its equal. Most Bakers use a ferment, but equally good results can be obtained from straight Doughs with proper care and attention
