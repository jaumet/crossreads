<p>friends with a dog cart &amp; packed into it &amp; away we went, away out past the Burrabor resorvoir &amp; into the Moors where their farm was.  I had never seen moors before but had often read of them &amp; now here I was right among them &amp; very pretty they looked as they stretched away as far as the eye could see in a succession of ridges all purple brown &amp; red from the vegetation slowly fading &amp; dying, every here &amp; there great rocky clumps rose their heads above the ridges &amp; torrents of water rushed down all the little gullies &amp; clouds of mist kept gathering &amp; rising as the sun struggled through.  These moors are covered with a low scrub, gorse fern, heather &amp; etc. &amp; to try &amp; describe their beauty is more than I can do for I could not help but drink in their beauty, it seems to be one vast great waste with no fences, ponies, sheep &amp; cattle roam about at their leisure.
