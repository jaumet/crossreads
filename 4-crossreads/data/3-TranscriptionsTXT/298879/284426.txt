 August 1915 Tuesday 24 Dusty. Have spent part of the 48 hours rest digging a dugout for Lieut. Taylor and am now pleased to say that I have now finished. Received three more welcome letters and a paper from home. 
 Wednesday 25 Dull. A heavy bombardment is going on at Cape Helles by our Warships. It is quiet in our position just now. We have had three Coy. [indecipherable] and our fourth is now having his innings. His name is Walker [indecipherable]
