 Tuesday 15 [14] May 1917 [1918] Quiet day.  Sat out on roof most of afternoon &amp; the sight of the sea is good indeed. Down in our harbour here is lying a boat, within their cabins drowned while asleep, an M.O. &amp; some men, hatches were opened by spies &amp; the boat sank. A balloon up evidently on guard looks so pretty a picture in the clear blue sky &amp; the soft sea air &amp; fleecy clouds are so different to our dry &amp; dusy [dusty] old Cairo.  7.50 p.m.  Surprise for me re H.F. is still worrying as do not know how or what to reply.
