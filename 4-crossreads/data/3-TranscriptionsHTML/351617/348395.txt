Here I soon got to know the 4 I was to work with Sam Charles, George Smythe, Bill Fitch, and A.O. Thomas who came with me.

<p>On Sept the 23rd we left Wippenhoek and marched to Dickebusch just on the right of Ypres, where we arrived about 7 pm. Owing to the cooker having broke down somewhere along the Road we had nothing to eat, so we started off as soon as things were in order</p>
