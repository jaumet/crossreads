July 2ndDick Hooper busy with villagers in purchasing wheat & barley.
My cook got to work & turned out a fairly decent though weird meal in which he mixed green plums.
My little girl came along this evening the Commissioner has done nothing for her even tho he promised, so Scotty & I gave her some washing to do for which we paid her 10 Krans.
July 3rdThese damn Native cooks just about drive me mad.  The old boy & his offsider commence by cooking first my dish & when that is done start another. He never thinks of cooking all the food at once & if left alone would boil the water for the tea after washing up.
