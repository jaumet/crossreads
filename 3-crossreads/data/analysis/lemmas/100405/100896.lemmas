 Sudden the wind chang and began to blow off shore , waft the smoke screen seaward and expos the British ship to the fire of the batteri . A huge searchlight locat the Vindict ; shell crash into her , kill score of men , shoot away all but four of her board gangway . At one minut past 12 , exact on schedul , the Vindict was along the seaward side of the mole , in itself some protect . There was a heav swell ; the grap iron would not hold . The ferryboat Daffodil nose the Vindict against the mole and held her there . She roll and bump as the storm troop jump down to the mole from lurch gangway . Machine-gun mow down half the first men over . An offic with one arm shot off wave new men on with the other . But the land troop could not silenc the mole batteri ; the men who were to bomb the seaplan hangar and dock were shot down befor they could reach them ; and the Vindict 's upper work , extend abov the mole , were riddl by enemi gun . Meanwhil , the submarin C3 , lit up by star shell and under fire , was speed toward the viaduct . In her bow were five ton of amatol which would blow her to bit if she were hit . The German guard the viaduct with it railway line to the mole believ the submarin was tri to go under the viaduct and into the harbour . In a moment of quiet the English heard their shout and laughter . The sub . would be caught fast ; they would take the British without a struggl . Her command , Sandford , drove the submarin hard between the steel support of the viaduct and fire his time fuse . He and his men hop into a motor skiff to get away , but it propel fail . They had to row for their live . Fifti yard ? a hundr ? two hundr . In one flame blast the viaduct roar high in the air , annihil it defend and cut the mole off from the shore . One job was accomplish . As the viaduct blew up , the blockship Theti round the end of the mole and hurri for the mouth of the canal . On her heel were the Intrepid and the Iphigenia . The Theti list heavili as the mole batteri tore into her . She clear the way through some steel net , until her propel foul on the wire . Mortal wound , she had taken the brunt of punish , could go no further , and signal the other ship to pass her . The Intrepid led the way into the canal 's entranc under heavi fire . She made the canal mouth , ram her prow into the eastern bank of the channel , then swung her stern around until it ground on the west bank . Her command blast out her bottom , and down she settl in the water . Another object was was achiev . The Iphigenia came in close behind , while shore batteri blast at her point-blank . Her command saw a gap between the Intrepid 's prow and the east bank . He swung the Iphigenia round to close it , churn his motor backward and forward until , after what seem etern in the wither fire , he had her where he want her . Then he threw the switch . There were dull thud below the water line . A third object was accomplish , the job done . Cutter went alongsid both ship as they were settl and rescu the crew . Mani strang thing happen in the confus of battl . When a launch smash a hole in her bow , a seaman sat in the hole to keep the water out . One group of offic took a life raft and found , to their constern , that it had an automat flare which lit on contact with water , make them a perfect target for German machin gun . A cutter accident left the Iphigenia 's command on a raft . See a rope trail behind the depart craft , the command leap into the water and grab it . He was tow for yard , tri to keep from swallow the entir North Sea , befor he was seen and pull aboard . An hour after the first onslaught the British recal what was left of the land parti and the fleet limp off under the shelter of a smoke screen . Even the Vindict got away . As the last of the launch put out to sea , the flagship Warwick ? which , with Admiral Key on board , had remain near the Vindict throughout oper ? slip in to search for stray survivor . In the thin smoke , aid by star shell that still rose vain , she sight a damag and overload launch . When the Warwick drew near , her Admiral 's flag lumin in the flicker light , the men on the launch stood up and cheer their admir . From that tini boat , that never should have carri more than 50 , the flagship took 100 men . Their cheer was the last sound of a famous victori . Out of a total of 1500 men , 400 were wound and 200 dead . Besid the ship purpos sunk , the British lost onli one destroy and two motor boat . Back in port , they heard that the simultan raid on Ostend , with the blockship Sirius and Brilliant , had fail . But their own gallant effort , which one offic had call " sheer madness" , was a success . The Zeebrugg canal was cork up . No submarin left it for five month . The German U-boat campaign was onc more base on distant Heligoland . The spectacular dare of the attack sap German confid , and rais the spirit of the Alli , whose peopl seiz upon it as a sign that the tide had turn . Seven month later the war was won . It had been inde St . Georg for Zeebrugg !
