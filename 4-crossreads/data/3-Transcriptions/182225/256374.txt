<p>Fine but cloudy. Out with battery headquarters all day, as a telephonist. Its not much of a job as there&nbsp;is nothing to do. Got letters from Linda, Father &amp; Jo. We played the 26<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;team &amp; beat them by 9 to 8, after a hard even game. I enjoyed the game very much.</p>
