<p>1917 Sunday 8 April</p>
<p>Easter Sunday!!  Last Easter Day we landed at Suez.   What a life-time has been crowded into the last 12 months?   New experiences- fresh outlooks.   Will we see the expiration of another 12 months before this unfortunate business is ended.<br/>Fatique duty during day.<br/>McBurney &amp; self go for walk after tea to ruins of Martinpuich.   Such a scene of desolation?   Everything splintered to matchwood.   Souvenirs &ndash; The old Tank &amp; knockout blow on the forehead.   Secure face of its brass clock.   Long dead Fritzs &amp; Tommies lying about.   'Twas in Sept. last this area was taken.   <br/>A beautiful sunny bright day   Symbolical of the day.</p>
