 Mr. Playfair is the Adjutant here, not Jack, the other one &amp; he's simply A1.  I do hope I do all right.  I didn't get much of a drilling in it, arrived here one afternoon &amp; my predecessor left next day at 11.  He has got a commission in Trench Mortar Battery, so have Brian &amp; Bertie Macnamara.  I haven't seen them lately, I'm very glad but I wish it weren't trench Mortars. 
 I had a letter from Jack Busby, he is in England.  I thought he was an officer &amp; got such a shock to hear from him he was a driver.  Fancy I got three letters from you at once 24th June, 3rd July &amp; 8th July, it was sweet of you &amp; is too to write so regularly &amp; often &amp; I do appreciate them.
