  
 The enemy who did not approach nearer than 700 yards, commenced to throw bombs with no apparent object: As it was thought his object was to locate our position by drawing our fire, we did not reply. Lieut Broughton MC. and a party of 20 men took up position E of Tea Post, with the object of ambushing the enemy's patrol. An enemy patrol approached our listening post who fired, wounding one man, thus interfering with Lieut Broughton's plan & his party withdrew. On the 29th & 30th [June] The enemy shelled the Area round "Scrap" Post - no casualties. On July 2nd the day observation post reported an Aeroplane descended in flames on extreme right flank east of Jordan. On the 3rd an enemy patrol approached the high ground N of Star Post, they fired three flares, threw bombs & opened rifle fire on our posts with the evident intention of drawing our fire. A patrol was sent out from "Safe" Post to try & locate enemy E of Jordan who were supposed to draw water from the river; but returned without seeing any sign of them. On the 6th four H.E. Shells fell in the Transport lines- no casualties. Our observation post reported an enemy's post of 6 men, & machine gun, Artillery fire was brought on to their position, & it is believed that the enemy gun was put out of action. Parties were employed daily on improving & strengthening position. Patrols were sent out nightly from Star Post to reconnoitre enemy positions towards Um esh Shert crossing; owing to the rough nature of the country great difficulty was experienced in locating these trenches.
