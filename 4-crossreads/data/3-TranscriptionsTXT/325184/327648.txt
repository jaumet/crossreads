 Sunday 2nd November Train running very late. Did not arrive in Paris till 5.30 am. Secured rooms at Marlborough Hotel, recently sold to a Bank and will close at end of year. Lunched at Caf&eacute; Giriffon. In afternoon called on Military attach&eacute;, Italian Legation, where we were issued with rail warrants for Rome.
