<p>the other end we formed up two Deep about 20 in Peace Squad &amp; after light Drill such as Right &amp; Left Turn, O Grady Drill was indulged in. In describing O Grady Drill, we form up two Deep &amp; the Officer instructs us that only orders that O Grady gives are to be carried out, for instance, O Grady says attention &amp; we spring to attention, As you were is the next order, &amp; If we make any movement we are out &amp; stand aside every order must be O Grady first, it causes a lot of fun &amp; very hard to do as the orders are so quick one is liable to make a mistake, after we are tired of this Drill we all sit down in a Circle &amp; one man stands in the Centre &amp; folds his arms &amp; keeps himself Stiff &amp; falls over on to our hands &amp; we pass him Around</p>
