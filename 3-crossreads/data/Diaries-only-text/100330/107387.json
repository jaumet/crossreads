in a few hours it would be hit. I met a N.S.Wales Artillery Boy there so we both came away together as it was his first visit to Poperinghe I showed him around until Tea Time then we both went to see a variety Show at the Soldiers Theatre, where a good programe was presented to a packed house. After the show was over I said Good Bye to my friend made arrangements to meet him next Saturday Afternoon if possible. I caught a Motor Transport soon was back in Camp retired for the Night. but had very little sleep as the roar of the Guns all night was terrible. The Offensive has now started I beleive a 4 days Bombardment takes place, then over the lads go, during the Night we had another Gas Alarm all was on the Alert for some time, but no gas reached our vicinity.
