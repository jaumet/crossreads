  
 March 1917 low & fired on us, but we returned it & every time drove them off.  A big Turkish gun tried to pick us up, but we changed direction & pushed right in behind Gaza cutting off all communication, & capturing more prisoners.  In the afternoon our infantry attacked Gaza, but it was too strongly held & only one redoubt was captured by the N Zealanders who galloped across an open grass plain  & dismounted & charged with bayonets.  It was a great sight.  The whole fight seemed more like a big parade ground movement  From a hill behind the town we could see everything, all the troops & artillery moving into position & the charge across the plain.  It was a pity it wasn't successful, everything seemed to be so well carried out. 
 Our Brigade held off reinforcements & worried the Turks from the rear.  We inflicted a lot of casualties among the Turks, one of our machine guns wiping out  whole company.  Two guns were captured.  The 5th LH had a bayonet charge on horseback.  We remained behind Gaza till 10.30 pm
