Thursday 31 May
Perfect Day - Cloudless and followed by long twilight lasting till nearly 11 o'clock.Left Camp at 7 a.m. by Motor Ambulance bound for Albert.  Car broke down a mile from our destination but we luckily managed to catch a lorry and so finish the journey in time to catch the 8.15 a.m. train to Amiens.  Arrived Amiens before 10 o'clock.  After the usual procedure of haircut bath etc. we had a good look round the city by 8 p.m. when we caught the return train to Albert.  As no train proceeded on to Bapaume tonight we sat on the roadside near Albert and waited till we got a lift in a Flying Corps motor.  Back in camp soon after midnight.Sent souvenir paper knives home.Met Stuart McKern & Chas. Jarvis in Amiens.
