1st of January. [1919] Another year started but under far more happier circumstances than any for the past 4 years,  we never went to bed till well after 12 o'clock, we were playing "bridge" till 11 oclock, then an argument started about Egypt & India & this kept on going till the bands came round & told us that the New Year was coming in, they woke practically everyone on the ship & sang all sorts of songs, "Auld Lang Syne" Annie Laurie" "wedoch & Doris" & so on & so on the old year went out, probably one of the most remarkable years of the worlds history certainly for the British Empire for it was touch & go for us, but now we are in a stronger position than ever & the same year saw both these things.
Saw a most remarkable sight
