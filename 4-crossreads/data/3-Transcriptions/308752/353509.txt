<p>The Petit Palais or Little Palace is also another wonderful piece of architecture. On the right &amp; left side of the frontal are two statues symbolising the Ocean &amp; the Mediterranean. The grant Palace of Fine Arts is a fine structure also. On either side stretches a colonnade with 14 columns, making a long gallery, the carvings in the roof, well, words cannot describe the wonderful work. We visited the Chamber of Deputies &amp; the famous Louvre Palace. A tremendous building is this Palace, it is 220 yards long, along the interior front runs a long set of arcades surmounted with terraces on which figures are carved. It is no wonder the people revolted at the time of the French revolution when the Kings &amp; Princes lived in places like these. We left the taxi at Place de la Opera, &amp; visited the Photographers &amp; lunched at the caf&eacute; de la Negre. The latter was recommended by some other chaps who have been on leave, &amp; a very good restaurant it was to, also a reasonable price. We were indeed very fortunate as we met an Englishman there a Mr Williams, who helped us considerable with the menu (you will find his autograph on the men which I have sent you). The meal was most enjoyable, we did as the French do made a sort of functions of the delightful repast, &amp; went right through the menu. We certainly took our time an hour &amp; three quarters at dinner. Returned to the hotel shortly after dinner then on to the Hotel Des Invalides.   Another wonderful place teeming with war trophies of many varieties.  It is really a Museum, we was a great number of German Guns &amp; war material captured during this War, also the Zeplin L.49, that was brought down on the outskirts of Paris in 1914. One of Guynemars planes which was draped in black, &amp; covered with wreaths was on view. Guynemars was a famous French Airman, who I believe brought down over 50 German Planes.  Other trophies were seen, but they are too numerous to mention. The hour we spent here was rather an interesting one. In another part of the building is situated the tomb of Napoleon, a really marvellous</p>
