August 1917continued   Hazebrouck & did a fair amount of damage.   A lot of the Civilians were killed and a number of houses wrecked.   Since he started the inhabitants have been leaving the town in great numbers & going to the smaller surrounding villages.   Ambulances with wounded, both civil & military, have been passing us all day, on their way to the hospital.10th   Fritz was shelling Hazebrouck again to-day, causing a great deal amount of damage.   We fell in on parade in "full marching order" for a route march but on account of the rain it was postponed, & we did some squad drill etc.   The party of 6 men returned from the musketry school at Lumbres after a 5 days course.
