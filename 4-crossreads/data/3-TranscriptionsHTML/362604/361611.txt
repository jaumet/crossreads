<p>was always large for me.  I suppose George had it altered to fit.  I am not bigger than when I came away except about 1&frac12; round the waist.  The money was alright.  You could have given it to Him for a X'mas Box long ago.  I told Him that He could make use of all my things.  It is no use letting anything go mouldy for want of use.  That is all humbug about deferred pay.  We cannot draw 3d. over our account.  Deferred pay is absolutely out of the question.  But if you send a note to D.J's London office stating that I can draw money up to &amp;pound;50 or so &amp; Dad gives the guarantee to the Sydney office to that effect all will be well.  Do the same with Ellis too.  Then if we want a &amp;pound;10 now &amp; then we can draw.  I had to go on leave with only &amp;pound;3 last time &amp; it was a strain.  I am always waiting for pay day &amp; I rarely go anywhere I don't spend 2/6 a week on pleasure.</p>
