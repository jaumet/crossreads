<p>Thursday, 19th November, 1914<br/>The boats we left at Colombo have now caught us up, and are in line the Jap. Iboyki [Ibuki] being their escort.  Our course &amp; movements are being kept strangely quiet, I have not heard anything from the signaller since we left Colombo.  The heat is now very muggy &amp; we are exercising &amp; hosing all day long.  The water is absolute red with rust, so we will have plenty of iron in our systems.</p>

<p>Measles have broken out rather badly over five men now being in hospital.  Owing to the porridge for breakfast &amp; lack of cooling medicine, nearly all of us are more or less covered in blood pimples.</p>
