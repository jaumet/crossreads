 Dear Mrs. Watts, I called at the War Chest after receiving your letter, and find they consider yours a case for the Lord Mayor's Fund. So I am sending you a form to complete and get signed before a J.P &ndash; If you let me know that this has been done, we shall send an urgent letter on your behalf &ndash; 
 I am very sorry about the delay, and wish we had known sooner. 
 I am Yours very truly M. Booth.
