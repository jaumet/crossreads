 Will's bedroom is just below the X.  All the officers bedrooms are there & very hot they find them.  Some of them, Will included, sleep out on the parapet near that big chimney but flies & light drive them in about 4 a.m.  The Nile flows beside them & the island of Ghizerah where they are is connected by two fine bridges with Cairo.  And electric trams run to the gate.  Hope you have been having good weather & that the garden has begun to recover.  The only fruits we get now are melons & figs. Love from Rene
