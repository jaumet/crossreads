<p>November, 1915</p>
<p>Tuesday 30</p>
<p>Still cold &amp; snowing but the wind is dropping &amp; so [indecipherable] for us for we could get the circulation going.</p>
<p>Walked over to Bridges Rd. &ndash; about a mile &ndash; for water &amp; got quarter rations last night the Turks bombarded Lone Pine trenches &amp; killed or wounded 250.</p>
<p>60 were caught in a tunnel &amp; buried alive.</p>
<p>Our camp was shelled by heavy howitzers but no damage was done for most of them</p>
