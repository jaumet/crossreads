<p>For four and a half years I had worn khaki, and my life during the greater portion of that time had been spent amongst men, - men who have won the respect and admiration of the whole world, - men with whom it was an honor to be associated, - men to whom cowardice was a stranger, cruelty foreign and to whom fear was unknown.</p>
<p>The brave, gentle, fearless, high-spirited and chivalrous man with the &quot;turned up hat&quot;. - The genuine Australian soldier.&nbsp; The ever smiling and &quot;don&#39;t-care-a-hang&quot; AUSSIE. - The &quot;genial&quot; Digger.</p>

<p>May good health - good luck - and prosperity, attend him and his.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Diggers, - Comrades, - Pals, - Au Revoir&quot;.</p>
