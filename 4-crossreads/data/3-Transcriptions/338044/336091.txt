<p>14th Oct:-<br/>Nothing of note to-day. Saw swarms of flying fish. Very hot  &amp;  calm. Had to sleep on deck  &amp;  at 2 am awoke with the rain pouring down on us in torrents. Blankets &amp; clothing wet through we rush for the top hospital    &amp;  spent a miserable night.<br/>15th Oct:-<br/>Operation for appendicitis this morning. Out of bed early preparing for it. Drizzling rain &amp;  very close  &amp;  muggy weather. The weather is now getting very hot &amp; the boys are going round the boat a la Freshwater   Cutting down old trousers etc. for coolness. Again slept on deck &amp; again at 2-15 am had to rush in from the rain.</p>
<p>16th Oct:-<br/>Off duty for a week from to-day. Having nothing to do is quite a change    &amp; I spent the day</p>
