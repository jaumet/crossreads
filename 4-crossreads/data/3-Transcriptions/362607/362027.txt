<p>Bulford<br/>13.4.18</p>
<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George<br/>We are 2 &frac12; years in the Military now. Time goes on does it not. Our Troops are having a hell of a time too. I wonder when it will all be over one way or the other. We must not worry though. It will all come right some day. Don't despair Dearest ones, of ever seeing us again. I suppose you get dumpy sometimes &amp; wonder if we will turn up safely before very long. I think the struggle will end one way or the other very soon. This is a snap taken in one of the lanes of the Village of Millstone. There were very few fences. All is hedge &amp; they are so pretty too. . Ellis has gone to London for a couple of days to try &amp; get some more money off the Firm. He wants to go on leave but neither of us has a penny. Well, Mum I'll write a letter tomorrow or Monday . We are both well.  Love from Harry.</p>
