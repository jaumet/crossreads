<p>20<br/>vain.</p>
<p>While at Corps I am told that my pay book has been discovered though I was unaware of its loss. I go to Railway &amp; obtain it &amp; then go to Paymaster to get some cash but find that it is mutilated &amp; the most important pages torn out &amp; that I can obtain no money. This is unfortunate as I had decided to let the duty slide &amp; visit Bruxelles &amp; any other large town that came my way. However the PM promises me an advance if I can get an identification from Corp.</p>
<p>I go to night to Caf&eacute; Central &amp; met Man whom I last saw at Liverpool in the 4th Bn. He introduces me to two of his friends both Gaby one of whom is french &amp; the other Belgian. When Caf&eacute; is closed I go to supper in a little caf&eacute; &amp; met one of the Gabys I dine with a [ISO] of 2nd Div. &amp; then wander about street &amp; put up in a private hotel</p>
<p>4&ndash;1&ndash;1919<br/>As I had seen adjutant &amp; been officially relieved of my command I take my time to day for my trip to Bruxelles with or without pay is decided on. I shave &amp; wash in my rooms at the annexe of L'Hotel de l'Europe &amp; visit Paymaster who generously advances me 200 f (&pound;7.13.4) just on my word that I have cash</p>
