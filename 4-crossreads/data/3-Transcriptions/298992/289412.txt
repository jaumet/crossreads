<p>a tremendous number of Australians &amp; N. Zealanders there, but we have heard the same tale so many times, that it does not cause much comment here, even though after all, the Canal is only about 100 miles from here, and if the Turks did get across, it would shake things up here in Cairo. Anyhow I hope they do try &amp; get across, it will end our killing inactivity in this rotten place. Excuse this being written in pencil, &amp; the writing, but I'm nearly frozen with the cold wind blowing, &amp; I can't get very warm sitting here. Tell father the paper he sends me come very regularly, and its lovely getting them. I picked out 7 from one mail this morning and Mr Hand our OC. (who is back from Hospital now) wondered if we kept a paper shop. But Mother, I never get any letters from you. I have only had one all these months, from you, and am beginning to think you must be ill and can't write. Dorothy is a real sport, and writes very often, &amp; lovely letters too, they being generally of rather a humorous turn &amp; they quite liven me up. I am so glad to hear the Bon is home again, although how sad it all is. I had a p.c. from Joan just before Xmas too. Phillippa seems to still send fond &amp; loving messages to me, though don't be alarmed Mother, they don't come direct. Golly!! Its funny isn't it? I wonder if she will be waiting out at</p>
