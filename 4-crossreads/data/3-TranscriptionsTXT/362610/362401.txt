 Tuesday 4 July 1916 Able to sleep in &amp; were heartily glad of the lie-in. The morning was fine but soon after lunch the rain set in &amp; continued till dark. The new bullets are much the same as the others, perhaps quieter in the way of being away from any village &amp; amongst the fields &ndash; close to where Rid was camped when I first visited him while his Bgde. was resting. There are fine large cherry trees just now loaded with lovely fruit : the pears &amp; apples are very tiny still. The crops of wheat, oats, potatoes, marigolds &amp;c. have come on splendidly, the oats looking specially well. The clover in many cases has been cut &amp; the little circular ricks with their thatch caps look quite unique. Meadow hay is being made too, &amp; the force of the familiar saying came home to one when one considered the weather being experienced at present. There was a gramophone at the billet so that we had quite a good time. In the afternoon we had an officers' meeting at Bn. H.Q. which took some time.
