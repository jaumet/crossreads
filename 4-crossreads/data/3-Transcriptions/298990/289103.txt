<p>Amiens, Vignacourt &amp;Flessells 6/12/16  doors and in one entrance in the street I saw a notice on a shop requesting people not to give money to mendicants.  Candles were alight before the long bronze statue in the side chapel &ndash; old stained glass windows have a patchwork look and designs are hard to follow but great skill has been shown in piecing the glass together.  The sacred bone relic of St John the Baptist was not attracting its usual crowd.  Some of the notices are rather funny &ndash; they request people not to spit nor to bring dogs into the edifice.  Before lunch we had cafe and a yarn to a major in the ranks.  After leaving the church we passed the Palais de Justice (now a hospital) and reached the Rue des Trois Caillaix once more.  Some French nurses passing.  We met Col. Smith and went along with him making a tall trio.  Stanbrook 6' 6 &frac12; Smith 6' 2, myself 5'10 &frac34;.  At a fish shop snails were on sale.  Found Smith's car crowded by the CO of Dir. Sigs was passing at the time and we arranged to pick him up at 5 and get him to run us home.  Commenced another walk and then went into a caf&eacute; for some coffee.  Rather a garish place with a Piolu kissing the barmaid but the black caf&eacute; was good and some French subs were there whispering things to bits of fluff picked up.  It was now dark and streets crowded.  Motors &amp;trams dashing past and great bustle.  An infection seemed to seize the blood and to be inflamed by the glances and magnetism of soft eyes etc.  Major's motor drove up and we dashed off homewards a bitter cold wind cutting us to the bone.  No speed limit.  Dropped out at Vignacourt church and soon jumped into another car and landed home in time for a good tea.</p>
