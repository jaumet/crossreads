 19/10/17 Pari From there by devious tube rout to the Church of the Sacr Coeur at Montmartr . Perch right on top of this histor hill it is reach by mani stair lead up to it and has a veri Eastern mosque-lik look about it . The climb made me quit puf and the view from the platform was not too good owe to the mist which hung over the whole of the citi . Inside it is new and gaudi in look and a servic commenc with much genuflect and candl light . A fat monk was preach when I left . Back by tube to hotel and after a rest came down and met E. take her out to 5 o'c tea . The way these folk discuss the demimond is frank and amus . Had some cake and ice coffe . It was dark when we came out walk back . This Avenu des Champ Elyse is most magnific ? at night full of light .
