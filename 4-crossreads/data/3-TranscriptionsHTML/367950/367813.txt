<p>clear and the "Cross" looked very beautiful I have waited for many long months to see it again Shall I ever leave it again? It seems like an old friend to me.<br/>"Oh star of hope whose tender beam<br/>Falls on my spirits troubled dream"<br/>Homeward bound for the land of the Southern Cross! I don't seem to realize it even yet. I shall wake up yet and find myself sleeping under a bush on the Sinai Peninsular on in some dug-out on Gallipoli or I shall wake up after one of those 10 minute spells at each hour on one of these never-to-be-forgotten soul-killing night marches again.<br/>Now for a short description of conditions of life on board the "Willochna" The ship firstly is 8000 tons we left Suez on the 8th March, did a record spin to Aden and were hung up for 14 days waiting for an escort to Colombo 3 days in Colombo and now we are approaching Fremantle which we hope to reach next Thursday. This ship has two propellers and 16 knots is an easy matter for her but the old battleship "Doris" out in front cannot go much more than about 9 &frac12; knots</p>
