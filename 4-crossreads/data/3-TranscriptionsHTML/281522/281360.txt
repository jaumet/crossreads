<p>23/6/17 Beaulencourt<br/>The Battalion marched out at 8 am to carry out attack on a village and jumped off at 8.45 capturing and consolidating the village by 10.15 am. Ordered a further advance on an objective to a flank &ndash; in the meanwhile heavy rain poured down and soaked all hands making them miserable. Sent the Battalion in under the Adjutant at 11.30 with the band heading the column. All the officers stayed behind for the practice of hearing about mistakes and discussing the operation. There were many points that came under notice. After lunch most went to an Officers Gymkana near Bapaume to which some nurses were invited. Personally went to sleep and gazed idly all the afternoon. Groves &amp; Wolff both returned today from schools. Miles lectured after mess on the subject of Supplies. The doctor &amp; myself discussed the chances of a permanent war. Everyone would look forward to its end now.</p>
