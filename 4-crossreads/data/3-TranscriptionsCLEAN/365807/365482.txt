Dear father,
It is always with a feeling of shame that I read your long letters from home & remember my feeble two pages in return. There is no excuse & I make none.
indecipherable  You sent me a list of letters you wrote in Jan. all of which I  indecipherable  have received except those of the 8th & 14th . If they were addressed differently to the rest, it is quite possible that they are still chasing me from stage to stage of my journey    indecipherable  here. 'Here' by the way, is in Westminster, with a wonderful view over countless chimney pots to a ragged skyline
The general has been very kind. He wrote to some of his friends when I came over & asked them to come & see me. Mrs Edwardes, too    indecipherable is always sending visitors, & as    some  I know a few people here    myelf  myself,
