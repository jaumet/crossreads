  
 Tuesday, 7 September, 1915 On fatigue all day digging saps, the Austs wont forget Gallipoli for digging many a back has ached through a pick & shovel.  Finished a good dug out to-day.  The new Brigades are nearly all in the trenches in now and our chaps are relieving elsewhere, our hospital is daily growing bigger, more of the poor old 1st L.H. Bde come in every day, half the poor devils are not sick but absolutely broken down.  The 8th Batt are going for a spell to Lemnos and we hear the 1st Bde has gone to Alex, poor devils they want three months at home before ever going themselves again, broken in heart with work but you can never break the spirit of that glorious 1st Division.  Went over again to the 6th F Amb but my brothers have not yet turned up. 
 Wednesday, 8 September, 1915 Date of transfer 1st L.H.R. 
 I was surprised on waking this morning by several non-coms congratulating me on my promotion, I did not understand them until the Sergeant Major informed me that I was selected by the Col to go round to the 1st L.H. Reg. as medical detail to Capt. Wells, the Regimental Doctor, his Corporal has gone away sick and I am doing his work the first thing I did on reporting was to be taken on the regiment's strength by the adjutant, then Capt. Wells gave me a dug out and put me up to the tips about rations etc.  The Capt has a horrible reputation for his laziness amongst the men and is very unpopular but I will learn more as time goes on.  However the job is a very easy one and is the envy of all my mates.  There are only two sick parades a day 8.30 a.m & 5 p.m, and there are about 30 at each, mostly just cases Diarrhoea etc and then I do the Dressings about 15 last night, I got through my first parade splendidly.
