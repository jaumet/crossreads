<p>sap with machine guns, or he would have got us. At 11p.m. the 41st Bn relieved us, &amp; we were wearily marched out of the line. Oh Lor' what a terrible walk we had. God knows how we did it, our feet were all terribly sore, &amp; it was a terrible distance. We left the line about midnight &amp; had to go to Bn Hdq's in a sunken road to have our tea &amp; stew  but on this new front our officer didn't know the way &amp; we got lost, &amp;amp tramped all over creations. It looked as if we'd never get there, we tramped &amp; tramped lumping our rifles &amp; various gear. The officer asked if anyone knew the way, but no one did. At last, after climbing embankments, &amp; tramping across grassy ground we struck it. Had hot tea &amp; stew hurriedly amp; had to set out on another hellish long tramp. Our feet were terribly sore, amp; didn't they ache. It was a clear night &amp; Fritz's 'planes were up, &amp; one dropped some bombs which burst with an awful deafening crash not far from us. This part of our tramp was along the road, we went through a village, talk about knocked about! I have seen some battered villages in France, but this beats all. It was battered to a pile of rubbish; I suppose before the advance Fritz was in it. On we tramped , &amp; the chaps were singing out , Go slow, what about a spell. At last,  about 5 hours' tramping brought us to our halting place, there weren't enough shelters &amp; several had to doss outside. They had no coats or waterproofs, &amp; after sweating on the long march must have been very cold in the night.<br/>Sunday 11 Aug<br/>I got under a low tarpaulin shelter</p>
