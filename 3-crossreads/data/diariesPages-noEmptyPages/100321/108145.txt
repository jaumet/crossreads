shops are full obscenely humourous postcards which take him as their text. We now had a long walk through some opulent, some sordid streets until we came to the Palais de Justice from which high place another fine panorama is seen. This building is enormous and modern. 2000000 of massiveness with an Egyptian or Babylonian touch. I did not care greatly for the place. Inside the reek of foul tobacco, stale air and traces of urine make one realise that here is the Dutch strain again. Even the custodians were puffing long pipes foul smelling. We entered one court and saw several witnesses heard being sworn by uplifting their right hands. Walked back to our hotel and could not but marvel at the great number of antique shops
