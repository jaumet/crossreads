<p>there is no harm done. But if Vol gets putting any extra in paper tell him to be very careful   <strike>r</strike> as I can get into serious trouble over it. Of course I know he is no [Indecipherable] but then he may not realise how strict they are about [indecipherable]. If it got about in the paper that I squared the major not to report me wounded, how do you think <u>we</u> would get on? I sent some photos home to Laurel that I had taken in London &amp; told her to take one down to you so hope you will like it. Well dear I'm no good at letter writing so will close now with fondest love to Vol, baby &amp; you from your loving brother <u>Hal</u>. I sent you a card  &amp; letter for your birthday. Hope you got them in time.</p>
