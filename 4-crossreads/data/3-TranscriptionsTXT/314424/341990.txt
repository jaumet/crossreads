Friday May 10. 1918. 1376.At about a quarter to 12 I was awakened by the picquet to go as brakesman on an ammunition Limbre. When I got up I found that it was to go to Allenville, so I rolled my blankets and was on the road soon after 12. We had to wait a while in Franvillers to load some ammunition and then we followed the battalion through La Housseye, Pont Noyulles and reached Allenville at 4.45. had breakfast did an hours picquet and the lay down on some straw in a shed for some rest & if possible some sleep.
