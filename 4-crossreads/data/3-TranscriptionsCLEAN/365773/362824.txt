Hospital France2.1.17My dear Sister,Surprise for you, I am again in hospital, this time with a slight hernia.I rejoined the Bn. & went 2nd in command to my old Coy, they were on the way to the line at the time ''rather unfortunate for me" coming right off the grass as it were. To cut a long story short the mud was too much for me & my groin puffed up & I was a stretcher case the 6th day after rejoining. It isnt serious old dear, in fact I wont get to England - all I want is a rest & then I will try again.I am afraid I have neglected my letter writing this last month owing my dear to travelling so much coming over from England etc. Tell the Mater I will write shortly love to R B & self from your loving brotherKen
