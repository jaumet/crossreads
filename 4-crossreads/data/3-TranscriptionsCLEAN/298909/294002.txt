Heavy wind blowing & sea very choppy, so far feel pretty good - very tired all day, slept forard last night on deck & only had a single blanket, nearly perished & had very little sleep. A lot of the boys down to it. Quite close to us is a French Destroyer & a Japanese Cruiser so we are in good company. Have on board 4 men from Warships to work the guns we carry after - The old Royal George is going some, but she is zig zaging a long way out of her course - we are manouevring the Islands of Crete, as it is a bit hazy, we cant see much on land.
I suppose we have on Board 2,000 Troops, & General [blank]& all the Doctors of the 14 & 15th Field Ambulances. Had some lessons in French - also Boat drill - A man has got to get in position for the night before dark, or you cannot get about, it is very awkward without lights. A Boat which turned out to be tramp steamer approached too near us & was immediately challenged by our guns so they are not risking anything in this zone.
