JANUARY 1917
5 FRIDAY
Fine, but dull & cold and sunny
but rained at night. Cleaning
harness all the morning. The
order came at dinner time
that we were to go to the 26th
in the afternoon, so we got all
our gear packed & the left
section went over. Their billet
is not nearly as good as ours
was, & we were crowed up like
sardines. Lieut. Rourke is our
section commander. There were
some German 'planes came
over us, some in morning &
some in afternoon & the anti-
aircraft guns were shelling them.
