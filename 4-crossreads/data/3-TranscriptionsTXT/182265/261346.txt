 interesting fatalistic story. 
  Entry  Saturday 18th Aug.&nbsp; 
 In troops Train travelling from Rouen to Hazebrook on Belgian front. I am O.C. Train which consists of 50 trooptrucks &amp; carriages. Troops include English, Scotch, Welsh, Australians &amp; Indians. After a heavy shower of rain just before starting&nbsp; from Rouen at  3.30  the day is now delightful, the country beautiful after the rain. 
 I am given a compartment to myself but have Jock Willis (Lt 15th) with me. We have boots, coats &amp; collars off as it is rather warm. The Seine - a beautiful &amp; large stream looks well - quite crowded with small stream vessels &amp; barges. 
 We arrived in Rouen about 7 this morning, went to  a  barbers for wash &amp; shave, to Officers&#39; Club, but as they were extremely slow there getting breakfast, Willis &amp; myself went to a small restaurant &amp; enjoyed Coffee, bread, butter &amp; French Cheese. --
