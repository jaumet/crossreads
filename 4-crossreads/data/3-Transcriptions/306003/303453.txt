<p>1-8-16<br/>Tue 1st<br/>Rose at 6 oclock this morning finished stables &amp; was just about to commence breakfast when we received the order to "stand to our horses" &amp; shortly afterwards an enemy 'plane flew over us.  apparently she was only out for observation purposes as she dropped no bombs &amp; did not stay long she also came over soon after dinner which meant leading horses off again &amp; at 4 oclock this afternoon 9 of our planes dropped 78 bombs on Oghratina, a Taube chased them into camp after the bombardment;</p>
<p>Monitors also bombarded Oghratina &amp; the aviators say they have altered the looks of Oghratina;  The 2nd Bde received several casualties today;  Watkins was not wounded a couple of days ago but was cut off &amp; crawled into Qatia through the Turks in the dark</p>
