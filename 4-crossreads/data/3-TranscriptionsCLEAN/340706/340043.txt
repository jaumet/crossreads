  
 to Cinema & am beckoned to their staircase but am far away & seat is filled when I arrive & I sit elsewhere. At interval I seek [indecipherable] with a rapid message having made arrangements for her next door neighbour to move & I spend next arranging to meet them on Tuesday. 
 In evening I go to  Carmen  by George Bizet who committed suicide on account of half received success of Carmen. Lafont took Toreador but was not pleasing Don Jose, Ovido Zuinga Roujon, Carmen, Alice Raveau, Micaela Mde Arty all from Opera - Comique The play was staged in 4 acts - Cyar Factory, Tavern of Lilas Pasted, Smugglers retreat in mountain & Cirque de Seville Performance is not nearly so good as last Sunday night. 
 Next Sunday is Louise a very long piece & a piece which I have just missed seeing several times. After theatre went to Paris Hotel for an hour & then home to Petit Quevilly.
