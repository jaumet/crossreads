Of those Australia gazed upon with prideLie crippled maimed & helpless uncomplaining through it all                    Remembering those who perished at their side.
So don't look at that picture as if Fancy gave it birth                           There is suffering, grief & pain in every touch                                                Sacrifice & deeds of bravery 'neath the surface lie concealed                      Tis Holy, try to think of it as such.
