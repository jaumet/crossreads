Arrive in Fremantle at 6 A.M. General leave till 3 P.M. I had a look round Fremantle; a music shop was afire, and about 50 of the boys, rushed in and rescued all the stock. Musicians came forward to play the instruments as they lay in the street; so we had a concert for half and hour till the place was extinguished by the fire brigade I slipped on board a train and rode up to Perth. Just had a look round, then returned to the ship. She sailed at 5 P.M. and by sun set we had seen the last of Australia; quite a crowd watched her sink down below the horizon. Nicholson's the music people, presented my company with a "Zonophone" and records and it is alright. It was a piece of salvage from their shop.
