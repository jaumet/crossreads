<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>While thanking you most sincerely for your kindness in forwarding this correspondence &amp; giving me a chance to decide for myself, I think that for me to accept the course which is offered would hardly be playing the game. It seems to me that my duty lies in the firing line, &amp; I am sure that Mother &amp; Father are of the same opinion.</p>
<p>You asked me to remind you to obtain a photo of my brother's grave. His full name was Arthur Gard&egrave;re Ferguson, &amp; he was a captain in the 20th Battalion.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your kindness.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully</p>
<p>K. Ferguson</p>
