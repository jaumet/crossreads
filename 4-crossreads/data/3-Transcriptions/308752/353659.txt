<p>regarding the Pater. Who should I meet in London, the same day;  but brother Oscar, we had tea together, &amp; off to a dance in the evening.  He is still the same old character. Spent the day at Mort Lake again on Tuesday, &amp; then bid farewell to all at Palmers Road, as probably I will never see them again. If I do happen to come over to this side of the World again, I hope that it won't be in a troop-ship. Strolled round London on Wednesday, &amp; met Eric who had just arrived from Fairlie in Scotland, and in the evening I attended another dance at the Irish Club. On Thursday evening I went to the Palladium, purchased a ticket at the Y.M.C.A. at a reduced price.

At the Eagle Hut on Friday morning, I was informed that a Memorial Service for American Soldiers &amp; Sailors, who had lost their lives in the War, was being held at Westminster Abbey. I immediately jumped on a bus, &amp; arrived at the Abbey, just before the service commenced.  It was a most impressive service, and the music was beautiful. The Organist rendered some fine selections, and the singing of the Choristers was fine.</p>

By that time all will be "insane", as the time will drag terribly   My Leave I enjoyed immensely, especially as I did it so cheaply, &amp; the meeting of so many old friends was very pleasant indeed. Nothing startling occurred in camp till the 8th of April, on that day I attended a Lecture at the Y.M.C.A., on the Growing German Revolution. Professor Spicer who delivered the Lecture, was a captive in Germany for four years. On Wednesday the 9th of April the A.M.C. party are moved to Fovant, which is about 7 miles from Salisbury. Inoculation against the "Flu" (for the second time took place the following day.  Two days afterwards I was down with the Flu, &amp; sent to the hospital at Hurdcott. Here I had a rough spin, my temperature was continually hovering round</p>
