London
Tubed to Kings Cross and there caught the first Scotch express leaving at 9.45 am. The day was fine and the journey to Scotland was a pleasant one ? the whole land is one ravishing green, heavily wooded. As usual I found Durham with its fine Cathedral and its old castle to be particularly impressive and wish time would allow of a stay here. Newcastle-on-Tyne black smoky and repellent but Berwick looks stern and looks warlike. The train reached Edinburgh at 6.30 and I went at once to Abercromby Place there to find the Colonel and Audrey Craig but Mrs. Sheila were away. Dined with them tete-a-tete with the Revd. Hunter Smith and then, after a little music we drank Scotch and after the Revd. had gone we got on to religious topics.
