  
 I think I rather surprised them by my pitching powers, but little did they think, that I had done a fair share of it, long before joining the Forces. 21st. Today we have been doing musketry fire orders & etc. practical work done on minature range. This afternoon we went out doing revolver shooting & it rained fairly heavily, I scored 21 out of a possible 30 & 12 out of 15 at the running man, second highest score, with a total of 33, then after that we were on the "range finder". 22nd. Out on the revolver range again today, I must be improving for I got 13 out of a possible 15, we had to fire 1 shot at 10 yds then run up to within 5yds & fire the remaining 5 in 7 secs
