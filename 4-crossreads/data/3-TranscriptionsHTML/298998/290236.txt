<p>and the other a Londoner, who have undergone amputation of both legs, and curiously also have each a fractured hand. The unfortunate men were brought into my barrack, and obliged to submit to the same conditions as the rest of us. The vermin, the filth and the smells, which alone were nearly enough to stifle me, were borne by these men in addition to all other sufferings; cheerfully and without complaint. The former, Bunter, had been captured on the 11th April, 1917. He had lost one foot, sustained a fractured hand, and received several bullet wounds. An artery near the knee joint of the other leg had been severed. Many operations had been performed on him at Stettin, whilst I was confined there. His wounds had healed, with the exception of the artery incision, which was nearly well, when he was discharged to Altdamm. The customary procedure here, is to place all new arrivals in the straffe barracks for 24 or 48 hours, to await examination by the censor. Fortunately I escaped this ordeal. Bunter was subjected to the straffe treatment. Throughout this time severe frosts occurred, which naturally were detrimental to wounds only partially healed. Owing to the intense cold and exposure "erysipelas" supervened. His repeated requests for attention being ignored, ultimately caused him to lose the limb. For weeks Bunter suffered intense agony. His indomitable spirit undoubtedly saved his life. Perhaps these two men have already told their experiences at home. I sincerely hope that they will have a convincing effect.</p>
