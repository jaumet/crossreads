 25/5/19 London Had lunch in a Lyon's shop and then tubed to British Museum only to find it shut so then went back to Oxford Circus to the Palladium to a good concert by the Royal Artillery band &ndash; but London is dead dull on a Sunday. Back to hotel and packed up ready for tomorrow's trip. Dined and then went into town knocked around the Strand and Piccadilly. The Regent Palace was crowded out and no seats were to be had. Round at the Strand Palace the reverse was the case and there was ample room. One sees all nationalities round the streets &ndash; the sound of an occasional phrase of French is agreeable. The tube delivered me out to Paddington at about 10 p.m. Ill smelling crowded tubes these &ndash; the moving stairs the one good feature.
