<p>[18th May contd]<br/>heavy stuff again fell very close to our outfit.  In the raid that followed an hours bombardment he again failed &amp; was cut to pieces as before.  We had a trip down at about 2 o'clock and had a devil of a job owing to ammunition coming up the line. However we got back by 4 am.</p>
<p>Saturday 19th  [May]<br/>This morning we got an idea of the damage Fritz did during the bombardment.  Hunters Avenue was practically a wreck &amp; trees were across the supply trench.  Wantage Hall another of our R.A.Ps was very lucky on several occasions and was knocked about a bit.  Major Honman went out during the barrage to Wantage Hall.  Gassed.  used by Fritz are chlorine which attacks lungs, Phosgene [which attacks] heart, lachraematory or tear shells which affects eyes.  It is said that he is using Prussic Acid but have not had any on this part of front.<br/>We were all very sorry at Major Honmans death by gas he was one of our most popular officers.  Lately he has [been] very irritable probably his nerves were shattered at the length of time in action.<br/>[Andrew Victor Honman] a6502125</p>
