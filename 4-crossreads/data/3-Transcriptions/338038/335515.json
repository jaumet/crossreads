<p>splinters off with the umbrella, that little incident heartened the men wonderfully.<br/>I suppose you understand that April 4th was killed, was the day and battle in which the enemy was forced to halt, from there he never came forward, the fruits of that battle you see during this month of August 1918.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>T. Williams</p>
