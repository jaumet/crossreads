<p>You will know before you get this letter that Terence had much the same kind of Tour and was sent back to Alexandria but has since been sent back to the Dardanelles in fact all the officers, that is subalterns have been seen to make up the casualties in the 2nd and 3rd Brigades, our brigade so far as officer's are concerned have not suffered at all 2 officers wounded Jack Playfair &ndash; Olding slightly. Playfair very luckly shell landed six inches from his face but didn't explode only threw up dirt and stones into his face I don't think it will diffigure him at all. He has not been with his battery at all he was observing for one the warships "Buchanti" at Kaba Tepe.</p>
