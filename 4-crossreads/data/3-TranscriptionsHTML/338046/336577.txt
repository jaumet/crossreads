<p>stunts in the new set of trenches behind the officers quarters. They were already wired so we had only to connect our phones and talk. The mosquitoes were bad as the dugouts were only used occasionally. Lieut Facey gave us an all day stunt around the district as a grand finale. The party I was with had to go past Wilton to a hillside, to set up a helio station. The sun refused to shine, it was too hazy for the big flag, so I volunteered to ride with a message to a station on top of Australia Hill, below the Roman road. I was also thinking of the bike ride. No soon did I start than I discovered that I was the mug. The bike was so stiff in the joints that it had to be pedalled down all hills while up hill, the only thing to do was to dismount and push. I was not sorry to see the journey over. After the stunt Facey, though talking "big" about more stunts</p>
