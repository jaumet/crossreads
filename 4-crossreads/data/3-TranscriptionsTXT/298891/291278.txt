 14 Saturday 
 Sailed all day till about 5.30 when we arrived at Salonique. Stayed on board all night. People began to loosen up towards last. Cheered the Jap ships as they capered off after safely delivering us. Great deal of shipping in harbour. Five great hospital ships. Heavy Italian cruisers. Some British flags. Spent the evening talking to various officers &amp; adopted a couple of subalterns. Dr Waldron took me to Purser's office.
