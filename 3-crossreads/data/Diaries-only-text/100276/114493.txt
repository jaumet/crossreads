we struck one snappy knowall Sergt. but I promptly shut him up in front of his officer too
As soon as we got our "posts" told off the men got their packs off, what a relief it was for the straps had cut into our shoulders stopped the circulation of the blood, they were quite numbed had no feeling in them however it soon came back, but it left our shoulders very sore, we took 4 posts over of 6 men an N.C.O. to each.
Bright early this morning our aeroplanes were up over old Fritz's lines, you could not see them for quite a long time for it was almost dark so they were losing no time.
