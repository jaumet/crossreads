Dearest Eddy
Yr lovely card  &  dear   Mummies just come Thank dear Grandma, Aunt Isabel, Ethel   &  Gae for their cards   &  tell them I shall write next mail. It is very cold here   [indecipherable] I have a cold - in bed yesterday with fire in my room so poor Mrs Barrie will   have to come to see dear Gae again soon  &  get in the sun! Fond love to you   &  Grandma   Mummie   &  Auntie -
