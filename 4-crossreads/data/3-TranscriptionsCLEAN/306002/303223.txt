  
 9.7.15 Fri. 9th.  A court case to-day, Cork was sentenced to 5 days fatigues, he should have got nothing as Cooper was the aggressor;  on returning from a swim last night I found a letter block here, sent from Cairo by Arthur Welch.  Geo. Edwards & the stores he went away for arrived to-day, was signalling this afternoon.  Last night there was a few rallies of rifle & machine gun fire & to-day we have had the usual amount of big shells kicking about with Steels Post suffering heaviest as usual.  The stores were issued out this evening before we went for a dip, we got 3 tins of condensed milk, 2 tins of jam & only 6d. worth of rice & oatmeal & no sugar.  I pinched some Indian meal off the beach when coming back for a swim, used half of it for breakfast this morning & traded the rest to Burke for sugar.  Smithers had to go on the Phone to-night in Marsh's place who has fallen sick.
