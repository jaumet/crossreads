<p>SUTTON VENY CAMP<br/>There's an isolated, desolated spot I'd like to mention<br/>Where all you hear is "Stand at ease," "Slope Arms,"<br/>"Quick March," "Attention."<br/>It's miles away from anywhere, by Gad, it is a rum'un<br/>A chap lived there for fifty years and never saw a woman</p>
<p>There are lots of little huts, all dotted here and there<br/>For those who have to live inside, I've offered many a<br/>Prayer.<br/>Inside the huts there's RATS as big as any nanny goat<br/>Last night a soldier saw one trying on his overcoat</p>
<p>It's sludge up to the eyebrows, you get it in your ears,<br/>But into it you've got to go, without a sign of fear,<br/>And when you've had a bath of sludge, you just set to and<br/>Groom.<br/>And get cleaned up for next Parade, or else, its "Orderly Room".</p>
<p>Week in, week out, from morn till night, with full pack an<br/>A rifle<br/>Like Jack and Jill, you climb the hills, of course that's just<br/>A trifle.<br/>"Slope Arms," "Fix Bayonets",then "Present" they<br/>fairly put you through it,<br/>And as you stagger to your Hut, the Sergeant, shouts "Jump to it".</p>
<p>With tunics, boots and putties off, you quickly get the habit,<br/>You gallop up and down the hills just like a blooming rabbit,<br/>"Head backward bend," "Arms upward stretch,"  "Heels<br/>raise." Then "Ranks change places."<br/>And later on they make you put your kneecaps where your face is.</p>
<p>Now when this war is over and we've captured Kaiser Billy,<br/>To shoot him would be merciful and absolutely silly. Just send him down to Sutton Veny, there among the Rats<br/>And Clay.<br/>And I'll bet he won't be long before he droops and fades away</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUT WE'RE NOT DOWNHEARTED YET.</p>
