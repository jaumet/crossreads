the Connaught coming back Chief Stoker's bunk & they fed us up tip top, for a few bob it was worth it I assure you. We were at Havre about 4 days & they marched us about 6 miles on top of a hill to a Rest Camp (tents) gave us 3 blankets & bully & biscuits. We went forth scouting & discovered a Belgian family. Lady little girl (Blanche) & a soldier husband. They took us in & fed us & gave us bedding to put down in the kitchen. We paid them of course but we received great kindness at their hands they couldn't do enough for us. Got them sugar (very scarce commodity) milk & fuel from the neighbouring cookhouse so were right in the boom.
