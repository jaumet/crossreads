near Luxor. The 1st Brigade has left Wardan for there and expect a scrap there shortly.
Wednesday 16th Paid to-day I have had a lot of money lately but it has all been to dentist etc Had my teeth thoroughly attended to, crowned etc
Thursday 17th Over at drug store getting full supply in we are now doing sick parade for 3000 men as the 13th LH Details are now attached here. The 12th LH are now detached from the 1st. My mate Sullie has now turned up and is anxious to get back, but we are having a good time together.
Friday 18th Did a lot of dressings during the day all fresh accidents and just as I was getting into bed after returning from the Kursaal with Sullie, a drunk was brought in with his head split open I had to shave and put four sutures in and he fainted on me and I had a job with him. However I made a decent job of it and he was able to walk back to his tent.
Saturday 19th (Eventful) Alongside our dressing stn is a stable and the famous Boom is trained here by a boy who I used to know well in Melbourne. To-day I journeyed out to the races to back him but we worked a joke and I had a good win on the winner Geramly, I had a wonderful day and I backed five winners out of five bets I could not go wrong. We celebrated it at night, by driving to the Kursall to the Review ?Smile Up? and afterwards had a six course supper. It was great day for me but Sullie did not do at all well, nor any of my mates.
Sunday 20th Sullie  I went to town in pm to Bulac to the club and then to Shoubra but we stayed too late and we never troubled about passes and the consequence was that we were caught in a raid on the tram by the red caps, we don't know what will happen but I hope Sullie will get out of it alright. A big mail in and I rec some old strays, wrote home to Mother during the day.
