Did a route march with packs up. Got letters this afternoon. Wrote some letters for we shall not be long now.

I guessed so. Gave in our blankets and marched from Bazeiux to Becourt Camp; about 12 miles. The coldest day I have ever known. Sent for a dixie of beer tonight, and it froze solid before we could drink it. Made the blokes gnash their teeth a bit. The ground is freezing hard tonight; all the better finish mud!

Rolled Blankets and moved up about five miles and went into huts at Bazentim. Covers with moustaches are busy shaving them off now, for they were coated with ice today; as their breath froze in the frosty air. Paid 20 Frs.
