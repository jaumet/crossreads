<p>Stan was trying to spin to one of his pals</p>
<p>Needless to say Stan was pleased to see me again and also, I, him.</p>
<p>A few minutes later we both set out and after half an hours plod found Watto and Keith Little.</p>
<p>Being invited to stay for tea we made ourselves at home and the tucker was some class. I am quite satisfied there are cooks and COOKS and stew and STEW.</p>
<p>After tea we yarned and focused our windows on each others photos etc then about 10PM. returned home to our respective camps well satisfied.</p>
