<p>Whilst the men that had already had 21 days leave proceeded again for 16 days on leave of absence and so things proceeded until eventually after every man had received 6 weeks leave the ship was completed with her refit and so on<br/>June 27th  at 4 am we left the basin and was taken out to the stream to anchor and adjust compasses, - we then appeared to be a different ship entirely, - new searchlights together with their platform had been installed, new fire control platform, bridge and very many other things had been installed and renewed &ndash; At 6 P.M. we departed from Birkenhead for Scapa Flow to rejoin the Grand Fleet, - weather was beautifully fine but very fresh, and onward we proceeded without incident and on<br/>June 19th  at 1.30 am. we arrived at Scapa Flow and once again took up our previous anchorage, - at 8 am we commenced to fill up our bunkers, The harbourage was as usual simply full up with ships of the Grand Fleet</p>
