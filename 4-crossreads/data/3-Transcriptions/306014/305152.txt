<p>It is too warm to wear our greatcoats now &amp; so we roll those like a life-buoy &amp; tie them round the pack. In our pockets we carry a supply of writing material, bible &amp; Daily light, pencils, purse, diary, 1st field dressing, bottle of issue iodine &amp; anything else that will go in. With the dry rations &amp; bottle-full of water added, one is ready for the road, wardrobe &amp; cupboard complete.</p>
<p>All being ready we set out for Amesbury Railway Station which is about 6 miles from Camp. The march there reminded me very much of the march from the Show-ground to the "Sueric" last year. All the boys &amp; officers who were not going with us turned out to cheer us off and a good number of the boys came along with us part of the way, as did also the Rollestone Band. The Train left at 11 p.m. for a destination practically unknown to us.</p>
