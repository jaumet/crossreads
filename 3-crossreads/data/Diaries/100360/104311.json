After Tea George Hand &amp; I went into Albert again &amp; had a \"petit [beeras?]\" .  It is most amusing.  For \u00bd Franc we get a Pork &amp; Beans tin of Beer &amp; for un franc we get a Butter Tin Full.  The Town is full of Tommies.  It's rotten not getting any mail.  We are beginning to wonder what's gone wrong.  I commenced a Letter to France, but I'm hanged if I know what to put in it.</p> \r\n <p>Monday 2.  Cold bleak wind.  About midday is snowed very heavily.  Last night a Fritz plane came over &amp; dropped a bomb in the Town.  Evidently they are after H.Q. but they missed badly &amp; did no damage whatever.<br> \r\n Tonight we got some new Music from Blighty, so now we can go ahead with a new Programme.</p> \r\n <p>Poor old M.S.

America coming in the War.  So now we are hoping that Fritz will throw up the sponge &amp; let us get back to Sunny New South.         Hooray.  Mail came in.  Got 3 Letters from M.S.  Now I can write a decent Letter in return.  The Prince of Wales attended the Anzac Show in Albert.  Bob Roberts offered to put us in the seat among the Heads, but we have a rehearsal on, &amp; I can't afford the time.</p> \r\n <p>Thurs.   <strike>Mar</strike>\u00a0April 5.

George Hand went into Amiens, so I was left to run the Show.<br> \r\n Johnnie Moore also went to Amiens &amp; failed to return.  Horrie Playford &amp; Wally Saunders did not like to go on without him, so Freddy Saunders had the Piano to himself.  He did very well too.

We are putting on a Concert tomorrow night &amp; we had a rehearsal tonight, so as to give ?em some of our best.</p> \r\n <p>Saturday 9.  Yesterday the Frenchmen on the Farm killed a big pig, to give the Bearers some pork; but when our cook inspected it, he discovered it to be an old sow about 90 years of age; &amp; too tough to chew; so Pork was off.  Johnnie Moore went into Amiens &amp; purchased  a big supply of good things.  The Banquet was gorgeous &amp; our Concert was thoroughly enjoyed by the Bearers.</p> \r\n <p>  Easter Sunday   8/4/17. Lovely day. After Dinner Dodson &amp; I went into \u00a0 Baupaume.  We got a lift in a motor Lorry. It was most interesting the whole way out. Fritz left hundreds of tons of Barbed wire behind &amp; a huge stack of coal. On the roadside we saw a whole train, about 20 or 30 trucks, which our guns had blown off the Line. We also counted 7 tanks which Fritz had \"knocked out\". The country is just like a Honeycomb, shell holes joining up to one another. We saw MacCallum in Bapaume. He is acting as detail to the 31st Batt. I asked one of the traffic police where the Town Hall was. He looked a bit surprised &amp; pointing to a vacant piece of ground said \"That's where it  was.\" The Huns certainly made a Job of blowing it up.    </p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300056\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 56]<br> \r\n Easter Sunday  The cemetery is a very interesting place.  Fritz went to some trouble in planting flowers &amp; making the graves look nice.  They also had some very nice stones to some of the Graves; especially the officers.  They had one of our airmen buried with some of their men &amp; his name was painted on the stone in English.  There is a very fine statue that Fritz erected in memory of their men who fell in the taking &amp; holding of Bapaume.
