  
 September 1918. Friday 20 
 Bty Pos.Rgt of Bernes and ahead of Villeret. Weather wet right through the day. Ordered to new Bty position beneath the wrecked village of Villeret, ahead of the old Green Line. Made a scratch dugout but during a Fritzer duty shoot, we had a few whiz bangs near the phone. Fritzer night bomber came down in flames whilst we were on the line. Spent a very unpleasant night in our makeshift dugout.
