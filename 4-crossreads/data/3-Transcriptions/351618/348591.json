<p>last night. The news today told that our infantry were advancing to take Hill 961 [Might actually be Hill 971 as 961 not referred to by Bean in the Official History]. The casualties on our side are expected to be very [heavy] and from an account I heard up to 2PM there were quite 2000 killed and wounded. Of course it is almost impossible to estimate the enemy's losses but we are told that they are terribly heavy. As we attacked we suffered the disadvantage naturally. To-day owing to the death of our Sergt Major one of the sergeants was appointed temporarily to the vacancy and as he was himself and as he was himself holding the Quarter Sergeant's position our Captain asked me to take over these duties temporarily. I consented to do so and I am now the 7th Battery's Quarter master's Sergeant and have many duties to carry out including the victualling and clothing of all our men here. It calls for a good deal of risk in going about in</p>
