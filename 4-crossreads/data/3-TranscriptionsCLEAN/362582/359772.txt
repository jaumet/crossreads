  
 see you some day & tell you all about me. Hope my different friends are not troubling you, if so write & let me know. Mind you keep on the telephone & pay for it out of my money. I cam manage very well with my pay, hope to be able to save a little soon. Trust you are not feeling the hard times too much. We have just heard good news. The French & British have advanced 12 miles in France, hope it is true. I'm sending a few photos with Sister Ralston, keep them until I return & I can explain them. Think I have told you all the news & my arm is very tired - Fondest love & kisses to you all & hope you are all well. From your loving sister Edith.
