<p>move last night at 11.30 the O.C. just arriving back from the A.D.M.S. Breakfast 7 A.M. to take over A.D.S. on main St. Quentin Rd at 10 P.M. Went up by car about 9 oclock to see what dressings &amp; things were there as a guide for my indent. Found very little but a lot of German stuff as the place was once his dressing station, it being originally one of ours. The best stuff had already been taken but I found German A.T.S. bandages, paper &amp; cotton, &amp; various drugs. The place was in a fearful state, the 1st Field Amb which we relieved having been too busy to do much. On way back called at the M.D.S. at Morcourt &amp; saw a lot of old pals the 1st also running it. During afternoon went into Depot at Daours &amp; obtained a small quantity of drugs etc getting back to the A.D.S. about 4 P.M. Rain during the day. Had word during the night that the stunt we expected was off. One of our balloons &amp; one of Fritzer's brought down during the day. News very good in paper, we still advancing, 1700 prisoners &amp; a</p>
