<p>France<br/>24th April 1916</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>Its quite a novelty to sit down &amp; write a letter in a dugout again, it reminds me of good old times. I'm writing this simply &amp; solely to acknowledge receipt of articles enumbered in rear of the left flank of this paper, &amp; to express my appreciation of them, &amp; not to take the place of next mail's letter.</p>
<p>We're having quite a glorious time, if it wasn't for the careless way in which the German throw things all over the landscape it would be perfect. What I'm going to tell you now, I actually saw &amp; heard. There was a small group of men standing together when an enemy missile came &amp; buried two of them. The fool of the party immediately passed the word for stretcher bearers, &amp; was promptly sat on by a muffled voice &ndash; "Stretcher bearers be d---d, come &amp; dig us out before another gets us."</p>
<p>Since I've spent a few wet cold nights in the trenches, I know more about the Kaiser than I ever dreamed of knowing before.</p>
<p>Give my love to all.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son</p>
<p>Arthur</p>
