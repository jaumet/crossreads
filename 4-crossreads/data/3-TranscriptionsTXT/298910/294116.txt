 No Artillery firing only machine guns &amp; rifles &ndash; very quiet behind the lines just as tho no war at all were on. Started evacuating from Bapaume to 6th Fld Amb at Pozieres by motor car service. A Zepplein reported brought down by gun fire at daylight near Amiens. 2 others escaped &ndash; heard they made a raid on Kent, England. 
 Monday  19/3/17 
 Cold &amp; strong wind blowing &ndash; but fine. Went for a cruise about over the country that we have just gained. Perhaps no pen will ever tell of the hardships &ndash; of the tenacity of the dash &ndash; of the mud &ndash; of the filth of the last trench, before Fritz pushed off &ndash; what a Hell the last No Mans Land is &ndash; Germans &amp; Australians lay there in hundreds &ndash; saw a Captain hung up on the entanglements &ndash; also a Lance Corporal who had died but not without his victim, who lay alongside him &ndash; Many souvenirs in the nature of Photos, post cards, etc were offering but as the weather had a bad effect on that class of staff, I preferred to leave it all alone.
