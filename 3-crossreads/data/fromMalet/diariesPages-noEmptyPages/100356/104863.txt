Up at 6 straightened up the stores none of which are being removed to camp as we move out again tomorrow.
Burrells horse died during the night worst luck; made acquaintance with the Canal this morning practically lived in it all day, visited Asia adding another continent to her list, troopers mercantile ships have been passing through all days; the military activity is very great, communications is by numerous pontoon bridges between the two capitals, and railways run everywhere, the navy patrol the ditch night day with monitors and large motor boats, stores are being unloaded from dozens of barges, anything from Railway engines to bully beef.
Heard that we move out at 4 tomorrow afternoon, a large train load of reinforcements passed through here tonight.

Revielle as usual
We set some drum nets in the canal last night this morning got a couple of eels out of them during the day got 6 more which we had for tea, they made a welcome break in the menu. Nothing much doing through the day so filled in the time swimming got frightfully burnt, troops have been coming going all day both by rail transport. We are to move out a 3 am in the morning by road for Hill 70 about 6 or 7 miles from here, WT chaps are to march, we tried to arrange rail transport for them but it was too late to be of any use, aeroplanes, large naval motor boats are here in swarms are doing extensive patrol work. French transport went through with Japs on board. Also 5 large steamers.
