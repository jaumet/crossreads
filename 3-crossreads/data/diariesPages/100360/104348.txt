Wed. Feb. 28 Busy day of course, because our Concert is coming off tonight. MacKinlay took 400 Blankets to be fumigated & another 300 were dumped inside my store just as I was getting ready to go out. The Show went off very fine. Crowded House

Thur. Mar. 1st We repeated our Show at the Church Army Hut & it was even a greater success than last night. "Oris" was brilliant & kept the crowd in roars of laughter.
