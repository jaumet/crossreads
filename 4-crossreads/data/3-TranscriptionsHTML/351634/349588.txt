We are at our destination don't know what time we are going ashore but the Choon has gone along side the Quay I don't think we will be long now dinner time and not in yet pilot came aboard at 3 pm Heaving up anchor going in alongside and going ashore 5 pm. We did not get into train till 8 pm. On our way to Cairo Well its dark now but the Arabs are selling chocolates and eggee cook. This is a very rough road to travel on. Later on We are at Ishmaelia. This is now midnight so will have to start another day Shall try a get some sleep before getting out.<br/>(Wednesday 24th)<br/>There was not much choice to get to sleep as the sleeping room is very limited we were rudely awakened up out of a doze by a lot of shouting so had to get out. It was pretty cool for Egypt as we all sought our overcoats. Arrived at Cairo at 4.30 am and waited for daylight to move off to our camp. Moved off 6 am and marched to Ab.... Camp was pretty tired. There were not enough tents for us so had to wait till our officers took it in their heads to get a hustle We did not get into tents till 6 pm Am too tired to go any where to night.<br/>(Thursday 25th)<br/>Woke up early and had a look around. Everything is sand and Tents. Our first march on the desert to day and the sand makes it heavy travelling. Mac and I are going to Heliopolis about a mile across the desert. Heliopolis is a new place lots of fine buildings and wide streets all places are built on the French system even the Trams run the same as on the continent. We had a good feed in the Red cross resturant. The one big place here built for a hotel they never got a licence for it. They are using it for a hospital. And it will be called the Australian no I hospital when the lads start fighting Money changers are in the streets and we all changed our English money into<br/>Egyptian money. It consists of Piastres and M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got back to camp<br/>early as we are going to Cairo to morrow. Well I am going to turn in good night.</p>
