1916   SATURDAY 27   MAY
No sun yet, but there was no wind today which was something to be thankful for. The 27th Battery put 4 teams against the 35th Bat. 9th Brigade Queensland and we each won two pulls. In the afternoon there was boxing tournaments in the afternoon. Just 3 round "no decision" bouts; but there were some tip top goes. Its Linda's birthday to day - her 21st. I would give anything to be with her for the day, but hope to be there next year, although I think I will be lucky to be home for her 23rd.
