<p>Dearest Eddy,<br/>We had a fine time in Colombo [crossed out by Censor]. So sorry I could not send you a card from there but I had been sea-sick, felt too tired to write. Hope you are all well   &amp;  happy. I shall send you some more cards later on. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. From Auntie Ede.</p>
