<p>is still firing along the beach where our boys are landing.</p>
<p>The "Bacchante" and the "Triumph" have just gone in close, one on each side of the ridge behind which this gun is sheltered &amp; are pouring shells up the Valley on to it.</p>
<p>A mine sweeper just brought a horse barge alongside of us &amp; one of the crew has a phonograph playing "My little grey home in the west"</p>
<p>Where we are now lying shells were falling thick an hour ago &amp; that one gun is still firing, some of the shots falling a few hundred yards away. Our Warships are still endeavouring to silence it.  I took a photograph of a Destroyer, with as a background the destroyed fort. Also took one of the fort with the Bacchante &amp; Queen shelling it. The name of the point where the fort was is Gaba Tepe. They are still banging away so I must go &amp; have another look.</p>
<p>8.50 a.m.  The Ships are just firing an occasional shot now, but the rifle &amp; machine gun fire on shore is just terrific &amp; continuous.</p>
<p>9 a.m.  The firing now seems to have ceased &amp; the Major in Command (while I write the firing starts again in dead earnest), was just saying that the Australian 9th 10th 11th &amp; 12th Battalions have taken an important hill.</p>
<p>Good old Australia &ndash; Jove just listen to that firing.  Let us hope our casualties are few.</p>
