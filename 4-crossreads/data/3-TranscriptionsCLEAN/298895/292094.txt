"Pushevillers"  Here we loaded up the train with the aid of the Infantry, all our wagons tentage etc going on & had a supper of biscuits & bully & tea about 10.30 P.M.  We then boarded  the train which consisted of trucks, everyone being in a happy frame of mind, singing & cracking jokes.  We lay down in our overcoats & although the truck had been lately inhabited by horses I slept right through the night.Tuesday 31st.
