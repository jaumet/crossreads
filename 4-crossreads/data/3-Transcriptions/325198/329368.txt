<p>18 Sept, 1916<br/>Bir El Hassaniya<br/>Back in camp again.  We were on the post until a bout dinner time yesterday, then our mob began to drop back, &amp; we fell back to the main body &amp; were flank guard going back.  They reckoned that if they had liked to press the attack the possie was ours but there was not much chance of holding it.  A Troop got back to where the 3rd Bde was &amp; here we were able to get a quart of tea made, &amp; water our nags, it was a pleasant surprise.  The old horse must have been feeling rotten but he came back with a bow in his neck &amp; a tight rein on the bit, hes game.  We messed about a hod for about an hour before settling down for the night, &amp; swear, &ndash; it was murder, we got fixed up about 10 o'clock then I had to draw some rations for the troop.  12.0 I got in bed, 2.0 up again &amp; then we got back here.  Its good to be back again.  Ive had a snooze, &amp; some tea, the horse a drink &amp; a feed  The boys are all resting strenuously.  Gosh how tired we all were this morning</p>
