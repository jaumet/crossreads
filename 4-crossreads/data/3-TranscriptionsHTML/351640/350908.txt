<p>30-6-15. 10-30 p.m.  And there arrived to day as a surprise packet ten letters, the latest date on any being 17th Febry. 1915.   From whence have they come?  Echo answers, whence?.   The only post-marks on the envelopes were Sydney   Feby. 15-3 to 15-.   No doubt they have been stowed carefully away, lest they might get lost in transit, some genius manipulating the envelopes after the style of the embryo field-marshals who are so plentiful in all directions, in and out of uniform, in these parts and mayhap in others.  What ringing his neck would get if only some of us could get a hand upon him.  With the letters that come here I am very particular because I remember how anxious I am about the fate of letters that have been written to me.  Some of my men have the tired feeling which might overcome them were my voice not constantly keeping them up to the collar.  I hope for letters bearing recent dates to come to hand during this week.  In the morning I shall have enquiries made from Gezeirah, and if the response be in the affirmative the car will call during the morning.</p>
<p>Caggie dear:  In yours of 5-2-15, you acknowledge receipt of mine from Aden.  Nan was with you and Joe in the mountains.   The garden must have looked first rate at its best.

I may write him a short note some day.</p>
<p>17-2-15.    Letters from Alexandria had reached you.   Glad you liked them too.   Sorry I did not get the regiment to which Dot's young man belongs earlier, as I should have written to him.  If he were here now I should look him up.  When at Mena I could not do so fearing to be away.   A card written in Tasmania by Matron O'Connor was with your letters to day.</p>
<p>Joseph dear:<br/>Your first bears date 2nd Feby. 1915.  Cramond.   'Tis said out loud in these parts that President Wilson and the Kaiser still play speaks, also that the war goes merrilly on.   What think you?</p>
<p>Your second:  17th Febry. 15.   I am quite all right as far as every thing is concerned.  Jerome is in good fettle, much better here than he was at Mena;  every one was half starved there;  and discontent reigned suppreme.   You were good to write to me so early in the morning.   Thank you my dear.  Many thanks for the copy of Clarrie Bridges letter, it was thoughtful of you to make the copy and not to send the original.  I shall write Clarrie telling that his letter has reached me after a long</p>
