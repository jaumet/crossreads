  
 23rd   Good news from Palestine this morning & once again the "Aussies" are in the limelight theres scarcely a day passes without them being mentioned somewhere or other. Got a letter from Len today saying that he would probably be going home to "Aussie" by the end of the month, he's lucky enough for anything & all I hope is that he gets away, I am making every effort now to get back to the Batt. for I would get mine right off.  Went over to the OTB. this  morning  evening & while there a big argument rose as to when certain units were entitled to put their chevrons up it ended in a bet & I am holding the money & also wrote to Horsferry Rd to have it settled. 24th.   Bright & lovely morning but the afternoon has been a failure
