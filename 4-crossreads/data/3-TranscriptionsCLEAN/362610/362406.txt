  
 Sunday 9 July 1916 Another Sunday very unlike a Sabbath. There have been very many such since I joined the A.I.F. Was up at 4 o'clock getting the men out & having the place cleaned up : breakfast at 1/4 to 7 in order to get the mess utensils away & fell in at 9 o'clock, moving off at 9.30. It turned out to be a most beautiful morning & day, & had we not been so heavily loaded up would have had a most delightful march from our billets outside Sailly in a general northerly direction to billets outside Oudesteen. We had the band, & of course as "A" Co. marched in front of the other companies we got the full benefit of the music which helped the march wonderfully. The roads lead through fields in which lovely crops of oats & wheat were nearing maturity, looking very pretty with the scarlet poppies & yellow mustard scattered through them. Nearing the railway line we came to a field of hops in which the vines had reached the tops of their wires, & thence onward this crop was not uncommon. Passed a number of people returning from church. Reached our destination beyond Oudesteen about midday but had to bivouac in a field until the battalion in occupation moved out. Rested during the afternoon. At night slept between sheets, a most delicious sensation. Most hospitable people at the farm.
