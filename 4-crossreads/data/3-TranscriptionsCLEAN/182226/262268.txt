Have been crook today.
Expected an attack at night. We have no supports at all & only 4 men to each post in the firing line, we would have had a bad time if they had given it a fly. As it was they opened up an exceptionally heavy rifle & machine gun fire which had no effect except making us a bit more watchful.
