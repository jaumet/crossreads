  
 little or no difference. 7th Colonel Monaison delivered the address to the Battalion today apropos the Conscription referendum- no one seems in favour of it and I don't think the [indecipherable]rates will carry much weight in putting it through. During his address the Colonel said" think of these slackers home in Australia! They are not helping us a bit. Instead they are stealing your job and mine" and somebody way back in D coy shouted "yes selling matches your B-." Col Morrison wasn't very well liked Ha Ha 18th left Haute Allaines
