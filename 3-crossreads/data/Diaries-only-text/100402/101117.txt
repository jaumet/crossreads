Bayonvillers. On Amiens- St. Quentin Nesle Rd.
Friday 9 August
Move again from Allonville to Corby, M.D.S. on the Somme, in which we had a swim. This place is just behind Villers Brettoneux just to right and about five kilos ahead. Again to-night we moved further out across the country over which our troops advanced to an A.D.S. at Bay on villers. Heavens our troops have advanced even now though five miles over the old German line, we are yet miles behind. Our marching to-day has been about fifteen miles to-night Fritz is bombing caught some chaps nearby. No shell fire much, but a number of casualties. Meet Roy Jamieson. All Divisions are in this thousands of prisoners have been taken. The advance is about ten miles on this part, through villages of Warfuses, Bayonvillers Harbonierre which of course have been smashed about.
Saturday 10 August
Early this morning we moved up to Brigade H.Q. just behind a C.C.S. once used by us taken by Fritz in his advance on March 21st. It is now in our hands again standing. It is just near Rosieres taken by the Canadians yesterday. The front line is just over the ridge ahead of us, about  mile on. Aerial activity is great, two planes probably Boshe, being brought down in flames this afternoon. I should say we are well over eight miles from our old front line. Fritz is now shelling locally fairly consistently. Harbonierre is a village we passed through to-day not badly damaged.
