<p>Bovington Camp.<br/>Dorset.<br/>Oct. 26th 1916</p>
<p>My Dear Mother.</p>
<p>I have written to Father a day ago giving the news, what there is of it, but have just heard that a mail goes tonight so write and include some photos. I'm very disappointed in them, but I didn't know the camera. Its getting cold &amp; we are all sitting round the small stove in the hut doing a perish. I have a chest cold but not much. Spence is in the Hospital with Pneumonia &amp; Clayton is down with malaria. We don't seem to be going to France for some time. We are moving to Wareham in Dorset next week. Always address my letters "abroad", not to any particular camp. The old villages in Dorset are charming, but it rains so often we don't like to go out much. Well mother I hope you are feeling fit &amp; taking things as easy as you can give my love to all</p>
<p>Your loving Son</p>
