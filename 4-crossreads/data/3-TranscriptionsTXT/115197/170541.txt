 to that sound which:- 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Growing louder, shriller, clearer, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proclaims the heavy shell as it draws nearer.&quot; 
 This huge wave merely proves to be the first of many which sweep our decks throughout the day. 
 Night approaches, but the anger of the sea does not abate.&nbsp; Strange though it may seem, it is the same vast stretch of water. 
 &quot;That running by the Castle of Old Windsor, reflects mirror-like the trees that line the river&#39;s banks.
