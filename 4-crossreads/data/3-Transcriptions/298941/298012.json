<p>Sunday 21 April<br/>Dog tired last night, but toothache kept me awake a long time.<br/>Lovely Sunday morning, clear &amp; cool. A band is playing somewhere, &amp;amp a few men from 9th Batt  headquarters are drilling on the other side of the pond at the back of this barn. At present our breakfast is being cooked.<br/>Heavy bombardment last night, but the German push rumours did not materialize.</p>
