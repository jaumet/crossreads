My diary from 17th Oct 1915
Sunday 17 ? Anzac 1st A.L.H.
C. P. by Capt Green, fine attendance, day bleak wet. Furious naval bombardment at The Narrows judging by report of big guns. Wrote home to Mother and enclosed poem. St Luke's day, on which Chaplain prays for Drs med orderlies.
Monday 18 Feeling a bit off indigestion had a good rest during the day. Good news from France Russia but ominous concerning the Balkans. This is the period that the Turks have for a four days religious feast and we are fearing an attack so the trenches are doubly manned batmen sanitary cooks all go in to make up extra strength.
Tuesday 19 Last night the 3rd L.H. Regs patrol was due home at 2.30 am but had not put an appearance in up till 10 am an officer and a man went out to look for them fearing they had been ambushed. The man returned wounded in the neck the officer is still missing. The patrol was found later, they had been lost and nearly ambushed. Sir Ian Hamilton is leaving this Force, being succeeded by Sir C C Munro. He has written a fine thanking farewell to all men serving under him. 
Rec mail today dated 7th Sept including parcels papers but more letters to come. One of my parcels contained a Balaclava a welcome gift.
