Sunday Sep 24We are having sports on the grounds to day & the weather has fined up for the occasion. They start at 1 oclock & there many events such as throwing the cricket ball, kicking the fball, foot, obsticle & relay races & all brought of with great dispatch. No time wasted as in Australian sports so the time does not drag.
The new OC had charge & had a good chance to show off his smartness. Then we also had a dress parade. Review order.

2 German Fokkers sailed overhead on observation but got a very warm reception being peppered by Antiaircraft guns.
