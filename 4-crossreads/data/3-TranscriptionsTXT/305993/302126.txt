 9.11.18 At 3 a.m. the Canberra was ordered to Alexandria for docking &amp; parted.  Two destroyers proceeding with her as escorts, the Hope &amp; Swan.  After the Canberra left we increased speed to 12&frac12; knots so as to be in Port Said at daylight Sunday Nov. 10.1918, at 11 a.m. we received orders by wireless to proceed to Alexandria.  So at 11.15 a.m. we altered our course for Alexandria we then being 60 South of Create Island.  We put up our speed to 16&frac12; knots so as to be in Alexandria at 11 p.m. tonight.  News by wireless that all arrangements are made at Alexandria so as to meet us &amp; guide us through the nets &amp; mine field.  Passed a hulk full of cargo towed by a armed tug bound for some of the Greek Islands.  Also a cargo convoy zig zagging escorted by sloops of war.  We are probably going to Alexandria to be refitted for more accomodation  for our colored crew as they compose of 2&frac12; times the number of whites that we formally carried &amp; have now about 360 of a crew.  At 9 p.m. 19 miles off the Entrance of Alexandria.  We stopped &amp; took soundings &amp; found we were 4 miles off the mine field.  Very heavy rain &amp; very thick &amp; dark.  The destroyers used their search light as signal but no answer from the shore.  So turned out to sea &amp; steamed 11&frac12; knots zig zagging until daylight as no guide ship could be seen &amp; it was too much of a risk to run for the mine field entrance without Lights as a Guide.
