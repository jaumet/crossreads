<p>that is one complete regiment &amp; out of the 28,000 we alone, wear the plumes &amp; are quite distinguished &amp; looked up to by the other mobs. The Y.M.C.A follow us wherever we go, (that is the [indecipherable] hence this paper etc, &amp; writing tent tables etc.</p>
<p>We are getting 20 per cent leave here for the Regiment, i.e. leave comes round about once every 6 night to each man, so he can go into Cairo. The money here took a bit of mastering but we know it now. It is milliems, &amp; piastres.</p>
<p>A piastre is worth 2&frac12;d English money. We get paid in Egyptian money while we're here. I'm wondering always how you are getting on in the little home of yourn. I suppose you've written but your letters hav'nt come yet as they will have to be re-addresses a lot. I ran against Bunny Richard in Alexandria &amp; he told me about poor old Gus Adams It.0 was hard luck. Harry Butler is here but I hav'nt seen him yet. Well Mum, Nance &amp; "Johnnie" I'll stop now &amp; write again soon, &amp; send photo.</p>
<p>Best love darlings &amp; write as soon as you get this letter. I hope you get it before New Year. Wait till "Johnnie" Site Pot comes home with his &pound;100 or so, then we'll have a time. God bless you darlings</p>
<p>John</p>
