<p>number of shells were sent over to find the trench positions.  and there were, also mortars &amp; bombs.<br/>May 23<br/>Our relief arrived promptly at 10.30; and we dropped back to support trenches, in which our positions were simply portion of the trenches roofed with boards etc.  Just before we went a severe dose of gas was given to Fritz.<br/>May 24<br/>An attack on our line is expected.  Supports were heavily shelled; and, when the heavy shelling was over, Lt Wilkinson <strike>who</strike> was wounded by a chance burst of shrapnel.  Usual fatigues.<br/>May 25<br/>Very heavy shelling in the morning, during which the fire scorched the whole neighbourhood.  Phil Knight is again in charge of the platoon.  Shrapnel wounded another man - <strike>Beesly</strike> Beesley &ndash; while he was standing in the trench.  More sickness, though it didn't keep me off fatigues.  Action appears to benefit me; it is lying in the trench that hurts.<br/>May 26<br/>The boys in the line repelled an attack easily.  We "stood to" but were not wanted<br/>May 27<br/>Fritz makes every fatigue a nightmare by sniping reserve lines with machine guns. He seems to have all our tracks well marked.  On a front line fatigue nine out of sixteen of us were hit and getting the wounded out was strenuous.</p>
