<p>January 1917<br/>17th    My first day out of bed to-day.  I have been allowed only to stay in the ward as the weather has been very bad lately &amp; is snowing now.<br/>18th   I was shifted into another ward to-day and have been allowed full diet-(I have been on light diet since I have been in here consisting of milk &amp; blanchmange &amp; occasionaly a little bread)   It is still snowing &amp; is now about 6" thick on the ground.<br/>20th   I met S.M. Mason of the 1st Div. Supply Column &amp; have been put on the list for a transfer into that unit.</p>
