<p>"Mines", Sydney.<br/>12 April, 1915</p>
<p>Dear Alan,<br/>We got postcards from Colombo, &amp; Hazel duly received your pretty present of bracelet, &amp; c, which was obtained from the P.O. without any difficulty or payment. I needn't say how much your little deed of kindness was appreciated.</p>
<p>We are waiting now for your first letter from Egypt, &amp; wondering when you &amp; Reg will meet, but I understand some of the camps are miles apart, &amp; there may not be direct tram between Gozeli &amp; Cheops. Take care of yourself &amp; &ndash; re the dust &ndash; open your mouth as little as possible &amp; breath through the nose; which also applies to the cold air at night following on a hot day. I am not sending papers now, as they are evidently obtainable on the spot.</p>
<p>Mills dropt in again a few nights ago &amp; had a quiet evening. It was very wet, but we all had a good old talk. He was most anxious to be off, anywhere away from the monotony of Liverpool. But we think he probably has his wish by this time, as on Saturday morning last</p>
