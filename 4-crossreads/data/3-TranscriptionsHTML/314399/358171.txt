<p>Monday 23 June 1919<br/>Cold &amp; windy today. We got the 9 am boat. Janet &amp; Violet came down to see us off. Got the train to Glasgow. Arthur met us there &amp; after taking our luggage to Queen St Station we went out to Alice's for lunch. Saw them all. Broke the news &amp; they were all pleased. Came to Edinburgh &amp; Janet went to visit pals whilst I went to Corstorphine. Told Auntie &amp; she was pleased. Saw Adolph again. He annoys me. I put up with him tho. Met Janet at Frasers. We told them &amp; poor Janet got a lecture. Had a huge rush for our train but got a whole compartment to ourselves whilst the rest of the train was packed.  A guard even locked the door for us. Had a bonny sleep.</p>
