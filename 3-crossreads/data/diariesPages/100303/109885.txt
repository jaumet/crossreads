 Each farmhouse as a rule is closely circled by its kitchen garden and a few flowers also lend to the ornamentation of the place. On the way today we passed a good many fields of that twining wreath of the Bacchantes ? hops. Well cared for and trained up their poles, these hops look very well in the sunlight. The Flemish aspect is given to the landscape by real old Dutch windmills ? not very many but old ones. The farmhouses are close together because a living can be made in this fertile country off a very few acres. This population leads to a frequency of villages all local architecture being dominated by the church. Very clean places these French villages. 
We reached Rouge Croix and went into billets at a fine farmhouse. An idea of the size of the barns can be gathered when it is noted that we accomodated 450 men in those here. The haymaking is now in progress and on the march we passed many workers in all sorts of quaint garbs, returning from the fields. There are plenty of estaminets hereabouts so tonight the lads will make merry with great wealth of liquid refreshment. The officers are all in a loft. Looking from the door of it a spreading vista of lovely blowing crops and lovely little farms meets the eye. The elm seems to be the principal tree. Just a little further on down this road is a small village which has a church in the centre. 
Heard tonight that Bird has lost his leg, poor chap. My Sergeants are a fine lot and a very happy family, Yeadon, Groves, Watkins, Nicholson, Thurlow, Glasscock, Bodinnar Trevena. Mounted are Jock Munro Crane and Stone is away. Went to bed early but very much to my disgust, was called by an orderly to see the C.O. at 11 p.m. Swore roundly and had just turned in again when orders for the march arrived and necessitated keeping awake. Slept in a bare floor in one blanket and got very cold by morning. Itch also very persistent about dawn and does not seem to get any better.
