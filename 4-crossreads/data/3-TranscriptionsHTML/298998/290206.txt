<p>in progress. During the operations the two nurses laugh and joke, whilst amusing themselves tying pieces of cat gut on the unfortunates, toes or fingers. This unwomanly horseplay clearly shows their inhuman, cruel and feelingless nature. I am position most men who have experienced Hun brutality, will agree with me in saying that the women are more inhuman than the men. The above is quite common here. Men are so accustomed to it, that they laugh at one if one ventures to speak of it.</p>
<p>29th-30th. Usual ordeal. 30th. Transferred to No. 7 barrack, situated in a block of ten huts, similar to huts in British training camps.</p>
