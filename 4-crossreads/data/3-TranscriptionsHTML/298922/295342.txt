<p>I got the Goggles please thank <strike>JOE</strike>, posted notes yesterday. Papers Australasian Nov. 25 &amp; Local Papers also came today many thanks. Got a Septic Gland in my neck now like a hungry jaw bullock but will soon be O.K.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through]  The wife is making great preparations for Australia her Mother is giving her a lot of Home advice etc. I tell her don't bring too much as I'm sure she will be happy, having many friends among all classes.</p>
<p>So many of our Ranks have Septic Sores like Barcoo Rot. I suppose it is the want of Vegetables. We had the same at times away in the Back country but not so bad as this.</p>
