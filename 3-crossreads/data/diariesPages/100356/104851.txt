Revielle as per usual.
Went up like a lamb to the slaughter this morning had a pretty gruelling time, the injections settled me for I couldn't stand the stuff I went clean out to it a couple of times consequently he only drew three I have to go again on Wednesday. Felt pretty ill all day, I was foolish to go so soon after the inoculation I guess I wont be caught the next time.
Started the Pitch last night secured a good spot to play on if only the niggers keep off it.
Horses went out as usual Norm took out Pards lunch for I couldn't hold a bar let alone see the road.
Wrote letters then turned in early 8 pm.
