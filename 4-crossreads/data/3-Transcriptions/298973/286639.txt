<p>Well, how is everyone? No doubt things are going on much the same as before I left. It's a failing with people who leave home for while to think that things change, isn't it? Jim and I are O.K., very much so. Both of us are feeling very fit indeed. All the letters I have written to mother, and the postcards to the rest of the family, have given little bits of news, but I intend this letter to be a kind of record of the doings of our unit. Most of the chaps keep a diary, but I think an account written in letter style would be better. Of course, as it is to be a kind of record for myself afterwards, I intend to stick strictly to dates, so that you will have to forgive some of these precise details.<br/>To commence at the beginning. At about <strike>2</strike> 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday 14th July 1915, we arrive at the Quay, ready to embark on the Troopship "Orsova," A.67. A number of friends were here congregated, mixed with the great crowd who had assembled to see the boat leave the wharf. We halted for a short time, just enough to have a few words with our friends, and then through the gates, up the gangway, and down to our quarters on the 3rd class deck. Here we stayed for about an hour. When the boat commenced to move slowly from the wharf we were allowed on decks. At the same time, too, the gates of the wharf were opened and the crowd simply poured through.</p>
<p>Everyone was greatly excited, and jolted and hustled along the wharf to find their particular friend on the boat. A crowd of people down to say farewell to Jim soon located us, and, as I knew them all, I didn't in the least feel lonely. Then the streamers were thrown, in hundreds and hundreds. It's a pretty habit, this streamer throwing, and as it stretches and runs out it gives you a funny feeling to be holding the ship end of it. It must have been a great sight from the wharf; you will have to ask Alan about that, but from the ship it was simply splendid .The cheering as the boat drew out was magnificent, both from the boat</p>
