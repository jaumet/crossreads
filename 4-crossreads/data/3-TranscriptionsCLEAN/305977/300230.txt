 Friday 25th Put in some pretty hard pick & shovel work at the new communication trenches. 
 Saturday 26th Had a fairly easy day only 4 hrs on the pick & shovel. 
 Sunday 27th Was on water fatigue.  It is a fairly strenuous job this hot weather as we have a full mile to go for it & a good portion of the track is through sand.  Got letters from mother & cousin Meg, also from Frank & Doug. 
 Monday 28th Very hot day. We had to stand to arms at 12 o'clock.  About 12.30 portion of our Brigade attacked the Turks on the right & occupied the Balkan Gun Pits.  It was fairly lively.  The 5th had a good few casualties mostly wounded slightly.  However
