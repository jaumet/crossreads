 Dar Dad, Mum & George, 
 Sunday once again but no news to give you.  Ellis & I walked down the Town last night but it was too dark to see the sights.  The shops are fine & the windows exceptionally well dressed.  The Town is not over clean & very smelly in parts.  Sanitation is not very much bothered about & the lavatories etc. are quite open & absolutely no privacy.  I did not intend to go out to-night but one of the R.A.M.C. Sergeants wanted a companion to go down the town, so we both took the Slide Car, which runs from the Top of the Hill to the bottom & up again [see image for drawing] like a huge lift & after an Hour's walk through the Town we hopped in a car & came back again.  We have taken over our Section from the R.A.M.C. & we have now to settle down to hard work.  All the shops are open To-day.  You can buy anything from a shirt to a motor-car.
