<p>On the way back we climbed a hill &amp; through one gap in the trees, seated on chalk, we saw a lovely view of the Somme valley, oddly reminiscent of the Richmond Hill view. Instead of Windsor Castle there was the ugly battered twin towered Corbie church, &amp; instead of the plain Thames waterway, the broken Somme. The trees were there in abundance, but white trenches unexpectedly appearing on the bare slopes around were hard to account for in the comparison.</p>
<p>I wonder if Fritz will see this part of the Somme valley again.</p>
