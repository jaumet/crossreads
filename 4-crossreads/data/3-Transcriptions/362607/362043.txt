<p>Dear George,<br/>This is London's Lake in Hyde Park. I went all around here one Sunday morning. Rotten Row lies to the left &amp; runs parallel for a while. There is a swimming match held here on Xmas Day. It was November when I was there &amp; there was no boating at that time. All the Ducks &amp; swans etc are tame &amp; people bring crumbs with them to feed the birds. It is great fun watching them scramble. There are several anti aircraft stations in the Park now, I saw the famous Indian General Sir Pertal Singh galloping up &amp; down "the  Row. He is passionately fond of little children &amp; was constantly pulling up &amp; chatting with one or the other. He has 3 rows of Colours. Well George I've given all the news to Dad &amp; Mum &amp; as 'Lights out' has gone I'll have to duck into bed. Ellis is already half asleep. Give Regards to Otto &amp; all the neighbours to Mr Frost &amp; all at Brookvale . Also to Mrs Love &amp; all the Club Boys. Do you still learn the Clarinet or have you given it up. Love From  Harry x</p>
