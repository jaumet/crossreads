Well to cut a long story short Stacky's name did not come out of the hat, and had to be among the few that went off as a sort of advance party, which was on December 16th, a couple of days before the last lot left. Before we left thousands had already gone away, and although we were not the last, we were among them. We went aboard the "Princess Eva", and arrived at Lemnos the next day. I have told you in previous letters of our doings at Lemnos also of my stay in the Hospital. On January 1st, 1916, I was in hospital and on January 3rd, we embarked on "Maniton" for Egypt. left Mudros Bay on January 6th, with two cruisers as escorts owing to the presence of submarines. When we arrived at Alexandria on Jan 8th I saw an Englishman's yacht, and she reminded me of the "Mawhiti". We disembarked on Sunday Jan 9th, and arrived at Tel-el-Kebir at 9 p.m. Marsh was another of the volunteers whose name did not come out of the hat.</p>
