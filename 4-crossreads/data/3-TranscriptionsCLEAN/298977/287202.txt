  
 2. 
 Suppose by this you are all recovering from the effects of Xmas.  I am afraid ours is going to be rather peculiar this year. 
 How is the Wool going?  I'd be interested to see result of some of the sales. 
 My partner is just beginning to sing again so I'll have to give in. 
 Best wishes to everybody in the Office, and love to All at home. 
 Your affectionate Son, Pte. 1280 Roy Richards.
