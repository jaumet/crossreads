<p>1918<br/>June<br/>had left us with Brain fever, caused as immortalized by the Battn Bard. (Tune Paddy McGurk's Goat)<br/>"Way down at Corbie, a place that's on the Somme<br/>The Captain went delirious. His name was Capt Thom.<br/>He raved and he roared about a lot of coots<br/>T'was all through old Shepherd, who wouldn't remove his boots".<br/>Sgt Shepherd did not take his boots off for a week or so, when in front of Corbie owing to his idea of being ready for a big Hun push. Capt Barber ("Achi") took charge of our Company. A favorite song at this time was &ndash;<br/>"In the evening, by the moonlight<br/>You can hear those darkies singing<br/>In the evening, by the moonlight<br/>You can hear those banjos ringing<br/>And the old folk they enjoyed it as they sit all night   &amp; listen<br/>To the music of those banjos in the moonlight.<br/>Chorus: Dancing in the moonlight, moonlight, moonlight<br/>Dancing in the moonlight, all night long."<br/>Darkie Stanton was singing this one moonlight might capering around outside the tent about 2 am, when old Achi arose in great wrath and told him off.
