At 6.30 I returned to the house where I had left Mademoiselle &amp; she harassed the horse &amp; drove me back as far as St. Gratien.    There I helped her unload the sugar etc. that she had bought &amp; then walked home the rest of the way after having squeezed her little nut-brown hand, and called forth a twinkle from the deeps of her blue eyes.</p>
<p>On the way back I got very hot &amp; thirsty, but all the shops had closed &amp; so I took the bull by the horns &amp; asked an old gentleman, who was having an airing outside his homestead, for a drink.   He took me in &amp; sat me at a large table where the farm hands were having dinner (9.30) and put a glass &amp; a jug of good cider before me.   I drank all I wanted, said "bon soir", "au revoir" etc. &amp;</p>
