<p>Thur. Feb. 27.<br/>The weather is simply perfect. Last night I slept on the roof of the Hosp. It has an awning over it &amp; is quite like sleeping in a Tent. The sea is almost as smooth as glass, &amp; one has to look at the water rushing by to be convinced that we are moving at all.<br/>We passed a couple of boats today, but they were too far away to see what they were. The diggers are busy polishing boots &amp; seeing to their uniforms, as there is a faint chance of us being allowed ashore.<br/>Friday. Feb.28<br/>It was very sultry last night &amp; and I woke up this morning feeling anyhow, altho' I slept on deck. We passed the island of Minnesoy about 9 a.m. about which is a Joke "Why is Minnesoy" "Because Suez."<br/>Pay is on this morning &amp; I'm wondering how much I shall get.<br/><u>Later</u> I went along to the Pay office &amp; drew the magnificent sum of 7/- again. This doesn't look too promising for my trip ashore when we reach Columbo, anyhow I have a pound, &amp; a promise of a 10 hr Loan, so that will have to do me.<br/>So long as I have sufficient to purchase a few souvenirs to take home to B.E. I don't mind.</p>
