<p>27/12/18 Gourdinne<br/>Piercingly cold day. Did a short round of the billets and heavily strafed a lot of people being in an ill humour. Our cleanliness and general sanitation is bad in the extreme. From today I fancy that it will be very much better. Afternoon was too cold for sports so spent it indoors reading. Orchestra played at mess in the evening.</p>
<p>28/12/18<br/>Steady rain falling all day. Made an inspection of the lines of "A" Coy and of HQ. this morning. The General, Staff &amp; Colonel James came to our mess dinner at 6.30. it went off very well except that some of the youths might have got merry a bit later! Plenty of speeches and there were a few under the table. My groom ? of the night of General's dinner was Col James!</p>
