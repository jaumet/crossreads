21-2-17time tonight. At 2 oclock I called at the Field Ambulance & got my teeth & was back in camp at Bayud at 4 P.M. The sand flies are very bad between here & Abd but nothing like they were last summer; A high sand ridge is close by the camp & along the top old machine gun positions are plentiful with heaps of empty shells & a few hundred yards East of the Camp dead camels & ponies & some graves show the guns of the 3rd L.H. Brigade did good work on Aug 9th last year when we were attacking Bir-El-Abd. Captain Harris told me tonight that he met Jessie at the 14th a few days ago; Major Lawrie & Lieut McDoodle  came today to pay the Regt a visit.
