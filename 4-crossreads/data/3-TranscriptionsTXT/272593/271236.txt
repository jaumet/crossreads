 There is still very heavy artillery firing up the lines, &amp; I hear tonight that our 4 th Div. captured 1100 prisoners the Guards are supporting them. They are paying the boys tonight so I expect there will be plenty of drunks knocking about by bed time 11 th.  Early this morning the whole Coy. were called out on fatigue. I had 40 men &amp; 4 NCOs in my party, our work was digging incinerators &amp; building bunks in the billets. We are living pretty high in the "Mess"   roast beef &amp; potatoes green peas &amp; etc followed by a fruit pie or something similar &amp; porridge &amp; steak for breakfast &amp; a good tea at night We are losing Freddie Turner today &amp; we are all sorry in one way
