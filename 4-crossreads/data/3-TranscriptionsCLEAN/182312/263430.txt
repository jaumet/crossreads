 entitled to all this fuss being made of them?  Men who have been 
 to both campaigns will tell you that they get more strafe here in 
 one day than they got in Gallipoli in a month, but that the 
 conditions of living in France are a picnic compared to what they 
 had to put up with on the Peninsular.  Undoubtedly they had to 
 put up with hardships and they bore them well, but are these 
 hardships to be compared with what Townsends men had to contend 
 with at Kut, or the forces at Salonica, or the men who endeavoured 
 to relieve Townsend?  I believe in kudos being handed out to men 
 when they deserve it, provided a correct standard of comparison 
 has been maintained, but I contend that in our case this has not 
 been done otherwise we should not be receiving the major portion 
 of the lime light which we certainly appear to be getting, now.
