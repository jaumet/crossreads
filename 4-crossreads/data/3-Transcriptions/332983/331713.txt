<p>Anzac, Compiled from the names Australia, New Zealand, Army, Corps. Taking the first letter from each word. We arrived there without accident We stopped there only a few hours and then went to Cape Helles and landed. I forgot to mention that a section of our Battery attempted to land at Gaba Tepe. I never heard or saw so many bullets in my life, As one of the lads remarked if another bullet was fired it would jam and form a sheet of lead. The   <strike>Conol</strike> Colonel and Head Quarter Staff, Doctor, Adjutant, and Vet officer were aboard The war ships were firing when we attempted to land, They were covering our landing. We stopped about 200 yds from the shore while the C.O. and staff went ashore. The naval landing officer said land 200 yds further down, as we were about to do so one of our staff officers Major Anderson shouted out What are you doing here go back. The Doctor (Capt Howes) almost got wounded, he was wearing his haversack a bullet went through it and a tin of bully beef, a very narrow escape. When we got to Gallipoli Peninsula, we got the order that 47 horses and all the vehicles were to land. I was told that a shoeing smith and myself would go with the horses</p>
