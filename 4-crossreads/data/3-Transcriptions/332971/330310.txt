<p>The same Hotel for the night that we had previously lunch at &ndash; And the Proprietor before admitting them asks them so stand aside and within hearing rang up the Police &amp; asked if Australians were Aliens.</p>
<p>24th  We leave bonnie Scotland at 10am &amp; at 5.30 Mr Bulby meets me at Manchester.  It is so nice during Mr &amp; Mrs Bulby again.  Sunday was an awfully nice day.  I go to Church twice.  I love going to Church, but this has been the first time for 5 Months and then to [indecipherable] to Mr B was a treat indeed.  In the afternoon he &amp; I sat before the fire and talked of S.A. &amp; the friends there of 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Next morning Mrs B &amp; I go for a walk to see an old Elizabethan farmhouse 'Hough End Hall' and a we approach it the lady of the house is showing a visitor out &amp; Mrs B immediately introduces us both &amp; as I am an Aus &ndash; Sister wonders if she would be kind enough to let me see inside.  She does &amp; it's very quaint with its massive oak doors &ndash; its tiny diamond window panes &amp; the [indecipherable] old side board in the dining room.  Mr Bulby is anxious that I should something of Manchester, so in the afternoon we set off together &ndash; first to his Club.  The Art Gallery &amp; we seem to just puddle in and out of those streets with their small uneven stones that makes a new comer's feet very tired.  I am shown a building built in the time of Queen Anne &amp; Ye olde Fyshing Shoppe 300 years old.  We sit in the Cathedral for a few minutes &ndash; visit a beautiful Library built in Gothic Style by the widow of John Ryland the Manchester Millionaire.  Pass by some Old Merchants buildings of Mr Bulby's there is a mile square of them all stores with Cotton.</p>
