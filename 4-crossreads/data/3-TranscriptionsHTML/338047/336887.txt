<p>1918<br/>Nov 3<br/>caught the 9.30 pm train to London by the North British Line. After settling down into the carriage &ndash; the Canadian came to see me off &ndash; I thought I had made a mistake in the class, things were so luxurious, but it was 3rd class all right.<br/>Nov 4<br/>I landed in London next morning 4th Nov, at Euston, I think, and after breakfast, had another look around the town. I went out to see Miss Violette during the afternoon. She was at home this time. She was pleased to see me. at night I went to "The Maid of the Mountains".<br/>Nov 5<br/>Wandered around London again. Saw "Soldier Boy" in the afternoon. Late in the afternoon, when it was getting dark I went to Horseferry Road to get my pack and equipment. I now knew London so well that I took a short cut through St James park and got so mixed up that it took me about half an hour to find myself again. I had made the slight error of trying to find Horseferry Rd on the wrong side of Victoria</p>
