<p>XXXXX<br/>Darling Eddy,</p>
<p>I hope you will like the hat I'm sending you by Sister Craig -   &amp;  that it will fit  you alright. I'm going to Alexandria to-day for a week or so, for a holiday. Hope you are all well. Tell Auntie Belle I have just received Parcel also from Mrs Balfour. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. From Auntie Eadle.</p>
