open, flat ground. We advanced about another 500 yards passed these field guns then halted. That was our objective for the day. There we dug in. Later a hot meal was brought up and also some rum. Then we had a bit of a spell and smoke and souvenirs were inspected exchanged. Very few spoke about the War. Other things seemed more important. The chief topic was how to get the souvenirs to Blighty without carrying them about for months.Altogether my battalion in this attack captured 6 field guns, 7 trench mortars, 64 machine guns over 450 prisoners apart from those who were killed, which numbered quite a few also. This was not bad considering that the number of prisoners captured numbered many more than the number of Australians who were in the attacking party.Although the actual attack was over, the worst trouble for the soldier, individually, had not yet come- enemy shelling.The best part of that day was spent consolidating our positions preparing for counter attacks. Fresh supplies of rifle machine gun ammunition and Mills bombs were brought up to our outposts, which we had dug that morning. After we had camouflaged our newly dug "holes" we set too and cleaned rifles machine guns etc. so that every thing would be in good working order should a counter attack be made. None however was made on us, he was evidently well satisfied with the doing he received that day.As we expected, later, he started shelling us. Enemy 'planes had been about through the day and obtained as much information as possible as to our positions
