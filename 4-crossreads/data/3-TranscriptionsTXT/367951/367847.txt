Dear Beat & FamilyJust a few lines to say i arrived home safe on Monday night. Their was four soldiers got in at Sydney and we broke every window in the carrage and when we got to Liviepool their had been another big riot broke everything in the pubs and in the shops and knocked the police to pieces. The reason i did not write before because i was waiting for the pay to day wednesday 15 day I met Mr Kearsly in newcastle and explained about your back money so you will get it any day. This is a beter camp than the other will give you more news next time my arm is shaking to much and paining we got inockulated again to day from Tom
