 Darling Mither, 
 It is easily three weeks since I had word from you, and I was very pleased to receive a small bundle as we hiy&nbsp;this spot yesterday morning. &nbsp;I was pleased to note that you were all in good health. &nbsp; Poor old Dad, I see, has&nbsp;had a severe shaking with pneumonia, but I was very pleased to see that he was on the mend in the dry air of Coonamble. 
 We came on here yesterday morning. &nbsp;We had been having a fairly easy time at Bohain altho&#39; the irregularity of the arrival of the train had to be reckoned with. &nbsp;Our French friends were sorry to part with us. &nbsp;There was a very good nightly show run by the 6th Tommy Division which was as good as is knocking around. 
 This place has been well out of the zone of the fighting, but even so it is well knocked about, and one can see the results of our bombs. &nbsp;All these towns about here are all well knocked about especially those of any military importance. &nbsp;They are all very dull, for it will take a long time for them to resume their ordinary course of things.
