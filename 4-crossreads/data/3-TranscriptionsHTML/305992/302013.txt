<p>June 22 Sat.<br/>Speaking to the officers of the transport Canberra re the Leasowe Castle the night she was torpedoed. The Leasowe being in the front line of formation the Canberra in the 2nd 800 yards behind her. After the Leasowe was hit she stopped. The Canberra came up &amp; heard voices shouting in the water &amp; found several soldiers hanging on to a raft in fact they passed them within a few feet. But the Canberra could not stop as it was against all orders. So signalled the nearest destroyer. They saw the raft before they realized that the Leasowe had been torpedoed. So it proves that some of the troops were either blown over the side when the torpedoe hit or they must have jumped overboard immediately.</p>
