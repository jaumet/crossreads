Wednesday 21st March cold trying to snow, on bearing duty. We go for walks in Bapaume. Thursday showery sun warm then heavy falls of snowy hailstones which melt on reaching the ground.
Friday warm sun but windy. Saturday 24th warm but windy, where exposed we went through the Cemetery the Germans have buried their dead in it, also the French British who died after capture, it is a nice little cemetery. We are still "bearing". Fritz has wantonly destroyed everything he could lay hands on, cut fruit trees down also other trees all left lying about, he left nothing practically of value. I went to see the Catherdral (in ruins) in the basement are hundreds of skulls (old) Fritz had ransacked the whole building. Sunday lovely and warm still bearing , but we have had nothing to do this last few days so we went for a walk. Made
