  
 130 "roaring forties" & we struck boisterous weather for a week including a Snow Storm. Had to be screwed down so things weren't too comfortable. 
 Plenty of entertainment on board orchestra & local concert talent also a miniature Picture Show which drew large "houses" & the remarks from the Diggers was always the Star turn. 
 Spent 2 1/2 days in Cape Town & saw the place- very nice too. Secured a car one day & drove round Table Mountain a gorgeous trip. Plenty of Fruit 
 Touched Albany- more fruit. Touched Adelaide- more fruit & said goodbye to our S.A. pals. Great excitement on the Wharf.
