41A Division of Grenadier Guards went through to-day, they looked fine.
26/8/16. Left Canaples for Rubempre at 10 am per Motor Lorry. No billet there for us so had to turn to & build one with a large tarpaulin. It turned out very cosy I slept on the table.
27/8/16 Sunday.Rained nearly all day, called to see the petite fille of the Estaminet. Went down for the mail after dinner & was lucky in getting 6 letters & a parcel containing cake & sweets. Spent the evening singing hymns it was great.
28/8/16.Left Rubempre early & are now quartered in our old billet at Senlis.
