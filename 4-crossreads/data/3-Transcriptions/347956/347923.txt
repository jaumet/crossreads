<p>oclock (noon)  After dinner we took our horses to the sick lines &amp; had them clipped.  a gang of "niggers are on to clip them (about 20 or 30 of them) &amp; they are "quick &amp; dirty" knocking the hair off them, one nigger clips a horse in about an hour, Idleboy objected to the niggers more than he did to the clippers, &amp; this afternoon it rained for a wonder &amp; we had a very nice fall there must have been 10 points altogether;  Stan dealt his horse away for a mare of Major Granvilles, I believe "Cob" is to be used as a pack horse &amp; he is a good horse</p>
