<p>The road was practically non-existent &amp; horses &amp; men were having great difficulty scrambling over bare rocks, slippery with rain &amp; mud &amp; also in keeping touch, as it was pitch dark, &amp; the rain bitterly cold, &amp; to make matters worse a thick mist had risen. At midnight on the 24th [March] the Bgde bivouacked at Wadi Lasbur &amp; remained there until the following evening. It rained steadily all day &amp; anywhere off the roads was a sea of water, &amp; the horses bogged to the girths away from the roads. Horse rations had run out and we had to draw a ration of Doura from some of the Camel Corps that arrived the same day. At Dark the Regt marched on Ain-es-Sir "C" Squad being in advance &amp; at midnight passed through the Circassian town of Naaur, although the place seemed full of men with every appearance of being soldiers, there was no opposition. The rain which had ceased for a time now came on again &amp; it rained steadily all night. It was bitterly cold &amp; progress extremely slow.</p>
