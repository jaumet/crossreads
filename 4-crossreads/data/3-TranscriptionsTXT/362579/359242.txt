Last night I stayed on duty late &ndash; the Night-Staff had their Xmas dinner and concert. I got back to Hospice about 11.30 p.m. One of the Officers escorted me safely   &amp;  we had a car, so you see we are well cared for. The other Sisters (29th) came back about 11.45 p.m., so we had a little supper in bed-room, saw the Old Year out   &amp;  the New Year in.
