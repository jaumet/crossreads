Have given your best wishes to all old hands &amp; they all - too many to mention individually &ndash; send best wishes to you. I will now give a little news of the old unit from the time you left as t may be interesting to you. left Soyecourt (where you left us) on 24/9/18 &amp; camped in Bois De Boire &ndash; near Tincourt same night. Next day was attached to 27th American Div which had 33rd American Div on its right &amp; prepared for an attack on the Hindenburg Line the Americans going first &amp; the 3rd &amp; 5th Aussies leapfrogging through them. The attack came off on 29th Sept &amp; the Americans got through alright but forgot to wipe up result many Huns in behind Americans who were badly organized. This [indecipherable] things [indecipherable] in a mess &amp; held up everything for a while but the 3rd Div got to work &amp; cut their way through to the Americans &amp; it was some fight not one German being taken prisoner. On 29th we moved to Saulcourt Woods the Artillery continuing to cover a front near Bellicourt  &amp; after some hard fighting got through to Busigny successfully. The old Unit had some casualties during the stunts. Left Saulcourt on 7th Oct &amp; proceeded to Hargicourt from there worked up to Busigny &amp; as the same lot of Americans had failed in an attack the Unit got into a very heavy barrage loosing a few animals &amp; one wagon but by good luck no personnel &ndash; my little black Jenny was hit at this place &amp; I have not seen her since. I was on leave at this period. Joined unit at Busigny left that place on <strike>29.10.</strike> 10/11/18 for Le Cateau.
