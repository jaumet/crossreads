<p>21/1/18 Boulogne<br/>Had breakfast about 9 and then strolled down on the pier and located the leave boat. A fine cold morning. Cleared out at 10 a.m. and embarked on the boat meeting Fairweather among the crowd. The men were packed on one end of the boat and the officers on the deck. Dropping out of the harbour a better idea of Boulogne could be obtained &ndash; all the houses covering the cliff sides and looking grey &amp; old.  We had a quiet but cold passage having several other ships in our convoy and being escorted by torpedo boat destroyers. Later an airship appeared &ndash; an awkward fish shaped object but it manoeuvred very neatly and came down very close to the surface of the water. There was a heavy head wind too but it did not seem to affect it. We made Folkestone about 2 pm and found Pullmans awaiting us dined on the train. The English war bread is very good and palatable. A pleasant &amp; quick journey.</p>
