Raining steadily this morning & early morning parades had to be cancelled, "what luck." Had to make out a fresh "Guard Report" there were, a number of mistakes in the one I handed in to B.O.R. last night, they are very complicated & there is quite a lot of writing & figuring in making them out, this was the first one I had ever made out, they are only used on Regimental Guards & such like work, I never saw one while I was in France the Sergt. wants a clerk when he has got these cursed things to make up
