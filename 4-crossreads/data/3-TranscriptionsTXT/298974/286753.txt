 2 This is why. Lyn Hanson happened to mention in one letter that Alan was leaving by the "Argylshire". As we drew into Suez there was a big Shire boat at anchor there &amp; we all remarked on it. After reading the letter of course I naturally wanted to tear off to her. But it was nearly dust &amp; no boats are allowed to move about after dark here, so it was imposs. The next morning I obtained an hours leave together with Mybur Docker &amp; Max Allworth, both of whom had brothers on her. But, before we had set out, Docker's brother came about &amp; told us all the men had left for Cairo. You can imagine my bitter disappointment I never felt so done out of anything in my life. And there was no further leave to be granted so I could not go ashore &amp; verify it even. 
 But this caps everything. To night, 24 hours afterwards, one of the postmen who had been ashore, put a scribbled note  from Alan  into my hand. It was from Alan. Of course I wondered. But isn't it the limit. He had seen our boat come in and had recognised her but being then on Orderly Room work he was absolutely unable to get off. Then, he did not go to Cairo the next day, but being up to his neck in work, try as he could he could not get  off  over. And here was I, half a mile away, resigned to the fact that he was in Cairo. He, knowing I was on board and yet unable to get across that half mile! He scribbled the note today, a few seconds before setting out for Cairo. We leave tomorrow for Colombo.
