<p>a lighthouse (showing three flashes).  Wednesday weather dull &amp; threatening, we had a marching order parade this morning.  Thursday weather fine but hot, we were paid this morning, steamers pass fairly often now, this last three days, Friday we are in sight of land on both sides now, having passed Mt Sinia this morning, weather perfect.</p>
