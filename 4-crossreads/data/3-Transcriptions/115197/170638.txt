<p>Tropical weather does not appeal to the men after leaving the pleasant clime of England.&nbsp; A growing friendship gives much enjoyment and relieves the days of monotony.</p>
<p>Dolphins &amp; porpoises racing with the boat and leaping from the water and flying fishes skimming above the waves provide a little diversion.</p>
<p>Morning parades &amp; inspection</p>
