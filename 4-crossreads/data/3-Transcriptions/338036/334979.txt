<p>Saturday 24th<br/>In morning I took a run down to see Bert Forrest again &amp; was more successful.  He is looking OK &amp; is pretty busy just now in arranging certain functions.  In the afternoon witnessed the Rugby Match between our Ambulance &amp; the 5th whilst resulted in a draw 3 all.  Brown scored for us.  It was one of the most evenly contested games I have seen &ndash; the Fifths forwards being particularly heavy fast &amp; strong.  Our backs played well also the forwards with one or two exceptions.  In the backs Wagstaff played safe at full back.  Swinnerton Brown Burdon Williams all distinguished themselves whilst Zocchi mc Bean Campbell Astbury were pick of forwards.
