Faulkner seems to have been a devout Roman Catholic and describes his attendance at services both within the camp and in nearby towns or convents. 
 Throughout the diary there are detailed references to scenery, weather conditions, inhabitants and towns, and also observations on the differences between various sections of the Australian forces (mostly Field Ambulance, Light Horse, Flying Corps) and between Australian and English 'Tommies'. There are also several mentions of delays in getting mail and in being paid.
