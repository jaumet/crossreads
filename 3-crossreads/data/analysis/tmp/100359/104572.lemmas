 ton of interest news , but when we come to write we ve forgotten half of it . Had a good time in town tonight and got surpris news and when we return to camp . Order to pack up and be readi to move off earli n the morn . Saturday 8th Poor old Sanitari Polic "fall in " for more hard work , clean up the camp befor we leav , Mac I got quit a decent sweat up . We left Morbeegu about 10 . The townspeopl gave us a good send off , and I 'm sure they were sorri to see us go , as the 8th Brig . had spent a lot of money in the place . We pass through some veri pretti countri and a number of small villag . We had a spell for dinner at about 2 in a town , and here we had the sight of our live , so far , are aeroplan duel , but unfortun , both ?plane went out of sight , and we did not see the finish . We were all jolli glad when we reach Estair , where we billet for the night in a warehous , in one of the main street . It was a great relief to get our pack off , as they got mighti heavi , after travel a few mile . After tea we had a wash , and took a stroll around the town which is of consider size . We look through the cathedr , which is veri ancient and contain some beauti wood carv and veri fine stain glass window . There are some fine big shop here , and some of them did good busi . We turn into bunk at about 9.30 and slept sound till about 7 next morn . Sunday 9th Left Estair about it , just as the peopl were go to Church . It is hard to believ that we are so near the fire line . As peopl in these town seem quit normal , they go to Church and drink beer just as though noth of import was on at all .
