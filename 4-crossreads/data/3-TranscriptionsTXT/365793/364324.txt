Aug 12 Slept well forrard, on deck last night & feel much fresher. Only had 2 blankets but didn't feel at all cold. No job so far, altho' many of the boys are M'ps, orderlies etc. A Sg't was looking for a Typist, but I knew "nothing"! Supply of silver on board is very poor! Concert after tea on the main deck. A couple of the boys sang well, the pianist was good & the ships Surgeon played his piccolo to some purpose; but the Colonel was "awfi guied" & when he was loudly encored he failed to tumble, & gave us another heartrender. The cigar, the sea & the setting sun were The best part of it
