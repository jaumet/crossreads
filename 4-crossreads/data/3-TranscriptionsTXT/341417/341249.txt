I have had a new job the last few times our Division has been in the line &amp; it is my most responsible one to date. Also the most trying one on my constitution. At present I feel a wee bit run down owing to last time being too enthusiastic in the manual part of the job.  Hope to tell you more later. 
 This is a country of mud in the Winter. You can never imagine it. Twice I have been bogged &amp; had to leave my thigh rubber boots behind so as to get pulled out. There are shell holes everywhere &amp; in more places that not, they overlap each other.

 I must be careful not to let such a gap occur in my correspondence again. Will now conclude with Best Wishes to You All Yours Faithfully Clem Walsh
