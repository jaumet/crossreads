  
 July 26, 27 my coat on, when lo and behold - three staunch Australians stood before me - and they brought me safely to your lines". 
 Parcelled for posting - to Mrs. H., Gellert, Waugh and two Sheldonian books.  To T.B.C. Lady Gregories "Book fo Saints and Wonders" return. 
 July 27 284. Coffee in the farmhouse five minutes ago compensated for a horrible day. 
 In the kitchen no lighting but the stove, and the blue light of the night through the tiny-paned window:  two old men, madame, and her mother, each in their corner, all silent.  Madame poured coffe out, and sank back in the chair:  still silence, and I forgot the day's disappointments and became one with the quiet.  Then a blundering voice outside, and a demand for "Coffee Madame?"  The usual flat platitudes, then he left and quietness came again. 
 Leaving Madame gave me the "good oil" - the French are coming here, we are shortly leaving. 
 July 28, 29 285. From Davis & Oriole, Masefield's "Gallipoli" and Houseman's "Green Arras":  also a bill.  In the evening to the Billet by Hondeg.:  then back and a listening to two thickset lads of Wales arguing and "Tearing" one another over the cleaning of their harness, when they last came out of the line:  the bout started on one of them telling me of their ins and outs of the lines.  So to the farmhouse:  Coffee and quiet.  Then I am in my own dream room:  ivory, yellowed walls, and cobalt-black curtains, and books, books, and books. 
 Bobby sent up from the Amb. a copy of Conrad's "Typhoon" and Lethaby's "Architecture". 
 Tonight a small notebook of Construction notes commenced. 
 In the Aisne Marne war, the French cavalry are in, and ground is still being won. 
 July 29 286. Midday.  A pale sun without rays and a leaden haze of pale light.  The pool:  the pool. 
 287. Andy C. reading a new Bulletin.  I asked what was in the "Red Page": "A book of Hardy's". "What do they say about it ?" "Oh, considering his age, they say its pretty good!"
