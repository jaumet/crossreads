Just as you are getting it cold there occasionally now so we are getting it hot though only a few odd very hot days, the real heat is yet to come I think. Well dear ones I am going to close this now to be sure of its catching the mail & if there should be any news later I will post on the chance of it reaching you for if I do somehow manage to catch the Medina this will be the last mail until I come myself, & of course I will wire you when I get to Freemantle.  I mentioned to you didn't I that I shall be travelling through Cook's.  I have a sort of feeling that I'll be home soon, I don't know: it will be beautiful to see you all again, just heavenly & I mean it, for this sort of life is as nearly the extreme opposite as I have yet had in my short pampered life though I know I might come miles nearer to it yet.  And after all I have a good comfortable home here & a better one over there, and all the money I need, & all my dear ones alive & well & am alive & well myself- but it is mounting up so, I had better stop. Very very much love to you both & thanks for your dear interesting letters, & love to nice Jobber too, Your very loving daughter Olive.
