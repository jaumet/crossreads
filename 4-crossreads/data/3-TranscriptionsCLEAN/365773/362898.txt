This is a group or pierrot troupe organised by our O.C. Major Rowlands who is sitting in centre of bottom row. While we were in our last rest billetts, they gave a show every night for 11 nights, it was a grand thing for the men & it was surprising the talent we raked up.The chap on the left flank is a Scotty and sings Lauders songs to perfection, his kilt, improvised from our O.C.'s rug.The chap in dark costume in front row Sgt Major Callaway has a rattling good voice & managed the affair. They were called the "Don Troupe" being out of D Coy.
