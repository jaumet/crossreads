  
 to the ship about 1 P.M. leaving a good number ashore who broke away.  The town is a fine one of good buildings & wide streets considering the native element being so prominent.   At first we strolled along being accosted at every step by native to buy tobacco & curios being the most mentioned.  We reached the post office & wrote several post cards home being attended to by a very civil attendant who procured pens & bought our stamps etc  We then took Rickshaws to the Galle Face Hotel a palatial establishment on the ocean Beach when I got outside a large bottle of English Beer  Then were taken through the Malay quarter back to the town centre.  Entering a shop with the idea of buying something small I finished up by buying 2 dressing jackets & a silk scarf for my mother sister and sister-in-law respectively. We had a great go in our prices ending up by tossing up over a disputed shilling at which I won.  Cost me 26/- in all and 1/1 postage. From here we took a Rickshaw to the native quarter & passed through the markets, getting a man to describe the different fruits & vegetables & showing  us how to chew Betel nut.  We bought Plantains & Pineapples to value of 3/- having beaten them down in price somewhat.  Returning we had dinner at the Bristol Hotel
