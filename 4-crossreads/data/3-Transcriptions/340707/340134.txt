<p>As I must wait 4 days to report back on Thursday for my orders. I then try to collect the allowance payable last march &amp; I am told that it has been posted to my unit. When I tell them I shall never see the unit again they consent to enter the amount in my pay book.</p>
<p>I then visit Harrowby &amp; Lady Francis strafes me for not going to Mrs Wilkinson.</p>
<p>I visit the Daily News &ndash; a daily &amp; see all through the printing works from the reproduction of photographs with their dots to the machine which prints &amp; rolls &amp; turns out 20,000 copies in 19 minutes &ndash; This is a double machine.</p>
