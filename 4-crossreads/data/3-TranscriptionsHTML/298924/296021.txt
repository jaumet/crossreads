<p>Saturday 8 February 1919<br/>Gen. Cox replies to my application to travel with my wife &ndash; "NO".  This officer "is required to look after his Squadron!!!", so that blows out that.<br/>Divisional sports again dismounted &ndash; a surfeit of demands for prize money from Officers who supply the windfall for all this sport.<br/>Am afraid poor old Day will find this hard to read but it is not laziness on my part &ndash; stationery too hard to get &amp; to carry &amp; I am so used to my Diary I "carry on".</p>
