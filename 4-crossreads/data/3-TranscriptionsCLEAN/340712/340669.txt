  
 Sunday I was able to eat a little and keep It, but felt very bad up to Thursday night     and after that wonderful pipe of tobacco I began to get right,and have eaten heartily ever since. On Saturday morning, the 29th ulto., we lost sight of land and did not pick it up again until Wed.morning. The coast of W.A. looked beautiful as the sun caught the brown pink slopes of the hills. Wed., by the way, has been the only cloudless day since we left Australia. We have seen the spoutings of whales, some flying fish, but the Albatross have stayed in the Southern Ocean-&#151;likewise the     . On Saturday we all had to undergo inoculation for Enteric- and are to have another injection in a week's time. The actual injection is a trifling thing, but within a few hours the arm swells and grows stiff and painful with rising temperature&#151;and for many it spells headache and dullness for a day or so. For myself&#151;and the others are about the same-&#151;the pain gradually spreads up the arm and down the side of the body. The swelling is still there now in the arm, and it is still painful to move or to the touch. Two fellows fainted (mostly fright I think) under the injection. ZEITOUN, 7th March,1916.

We are moving to Tel-el-Kebir tomorrow (we only got word this afternoon) to join our Brigade. It is 50 to 60 miles
