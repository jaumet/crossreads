<p>Monday 31 December 1917<br/>The last day of this so far most adventurous year of my quiet life.  May the next see peace in this sad old world is my prayer!<br/>On duty 'till 5 p.m. &amp; had some good talks to interesting pts. &ndash; one, Ward, described the river Amazon, fastest current of any river, 5 knots per hour, narrow as "Connaught" ward in places yet a 12,000 ton boat may get up, has seen a cargo of 5000 tons Brazilian nuts shipped away from the port.  Chief exports are coffee, rubber, &amp; nuts.<br/>At 5.18 p.m. motored to Mena House with S. Watson &amp; McCain, then under the shadow of the old Pyramids with a lovely little wind blowing had our palms read, then dinner &amp; so home.  Fortune in my face &amp; <u>very good</u>, wherever I go, good, marry in 7 months, going further on in 9 days, 4 days trip, etc.  Back at 27th G.H. 8 p.m. &amp; so closes 1917.  May '18 bring Peace.</p>
