<p>Thursday 19 June 1919<br/>Intended going to Loch Lomond but it is far too wet. Forgot to close my window in the night &amp; all my clothes got soaked. Rain cleared in the afternoon &amp; Violet, Janet &amp; I cycled to Dunoon. Had an ice &amp; bought some cakes &amp; then came home. Went to Blairmore &amp; saw the village maid (she isn't all there).</p>
<p>Friday 20 June 1919<br/>Fine for a while so we started for Loch Lomond. Had to change boats at Kilcraggen &amp; then to a train at Craigendoran We missed the train at 11 am &amp; had to wait till 1.30 pm. So went into Helensburg &amp; had lunch. got the train at Craigendoran at 1.30 &amp; went to Arrochar &amp; from there walked to Tarbett. The train trip was goodo. Beautiful scenery. Came right along two Lochs. Loch Loy &amp; Gare Loch. Missed the boat at Tarbett so went for a walk along the banks of Loch Lomond. Very nice indeed. Got the train back &amp; had to wait 1 &frac12; hours at Criagendoran again. got a boat home tho. Had a most enjoyable day. Do me everytime. It rained very heavily all the morning but was nice and warm after lunch.</p>
