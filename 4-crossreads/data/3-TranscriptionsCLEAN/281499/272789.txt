men into position & started them off they worked real well & by 9.30 had a trench nearly finished, about 7.30 Mr Lancer left & so I was in charge of the whole bunch, we dug up several big shells including 5.9's & "rum jars"  Just before 10 oclock B. Coy's bomber's went over & bombed the Germans in their trenches, & then D.A & C. followed in turn at different hours during the night, they were all very successful & entered the German trenches in spite of their opposition, one of our Coy chaps had a rather trifling experience during the bombing uproar, he along with the others hopped into the Hun's trenches & proceeded to lay about him with his bombs when they were heavily attacked on both flanks by German bombers so they all clambered out on top where
