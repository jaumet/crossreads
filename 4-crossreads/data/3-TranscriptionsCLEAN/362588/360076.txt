Dear Judge,
Very many thanks for your letter.  It was most good of you to write and letters are such a Godsend to us here.  You must please excuse the scrap of paper - but notepaper is very scarce here now.  I am afraid there is no chance of intercepting your letter to MacLaurin.  I have only recently returned from Hospital.  MacLaurin was killed on April 27 & his letters are not now delivered here.
We are all very sick here at the way you are being deluded with the casualty lists in Australia.  The fighting commenced at dawn on April 15 & in the first 2 days the Australian & N.Z. casualties were in the neighbourhood of 5000 - & by May 10 - 8000 - yet according to the Sydney files just to hand of May 15, you have been informed of some 1800.
Personally I only had 36 hours of it, & during that time managed to stop a shrapnel bullet on the top of the head (only a graze) - the nose of a shrapnel shell on my jaw & a bullet in the side, which luckily went through, & my lungs healed up in 3 days.  The number of fine men who have gone is pitiable.  The first boatload ashore of the 1st Brigade contained the following Officers, MacLaurin, Onslow Thompson, Irvine, Smith, Anderson, Massie, King & self.  The first four named are dead, King & self wounded, Anderson & Massie have not yet been plugged.  MacLaurin was shot in the head by a sniper - he lived a little over an hour, but never regained consciousness.  My Colonel, Irvine & Smith were shot dead.  And so it is right through the Division.  My Battalion has had 20 casualties among the officers, & we have been one of the lucky ones.
