<p>weeks ago, &amp; knew the way to take my company guides. It was 5 miles when we got there, the captain of the company  our lot take up, who of course, had already been up to see the line he was to take over, was surprised we had come so far back, said he expected we'd guide his platoons up from the cross-roads. Of course, the coots who sent us down don't care if we have to do the trip down, back &amp; down again (15 miles). We got down to the 50th about 6 p.m., they gave us some tea, &amp; about 10p.m their battalion moved on up. I went with the platoon who will relieve the lot I'm with in the line. There were other guides at the crossroads, &amp; the new lot got to the line, &amp; took over from us without mishap. It is just as well the enemy don't know when a relief is taking place in this game, or his shells would do some harm. Our company didn't have the same fortune going out, &amp; there's no doubt this war is an awful business. We left by platoons, ours had a rough spin going down to the rear, don't know whether the Boche had an idea of what was on, or was just shelling the rear as per usual, but some shells hit the road in front of us. We made off to the left, &amp; others fell</p>
