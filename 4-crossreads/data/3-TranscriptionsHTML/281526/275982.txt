<p>23/11/17 Kemmell Huts near Locre<br/>Finer, with a sun of no power or warmth. Men on baths &amp;c during the morning. Went round about endeavouring to get the use of some fields for sport &amp; training but had little luck. Many of the people are in the direst poverty and cannot speak French at all. After lunch rode up over the Kemmell Ridge to the village &ndash; a very pretty ride. From the top of the ridge there is a fine view for miles a great sight first of all of crowded Camps and transport lines. Then a zone of gun flashes beyond that the trenches. A flat dreary zone. The Messines ridge is plain from here. A.J.Smith came into to tea. Inspected the rifle range &amp; platoon there. At 6 o'c a Gotha came over &amp; dropped about 7 bombs which landed very close &ndash; one within 50 yards. Some splinters round but no damage fortunately. Mounted L.G.s but they can do no good. "B" Coy had a fine company euchre party &amp; singsong tonight finishing with refreshments. All in good fettle.</p>
