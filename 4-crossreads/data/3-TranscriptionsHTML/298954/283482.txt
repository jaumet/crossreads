<p>1917<br/>Sat. June 16th<br/>The "Wairuna" &amp; "Wolf" <strike>were steaming</strike> steamed out in company from the island at abt 3 pm.  The two vessels had stopped and the "Wairuna" was about to be sunk by bombs when a sail was sighted off the port bow.  We prisoners were hustled below from the poop deck &ndash; not before the sailing-ship was clearly visible from the deck.</p>
<p>We were locked in the hold and the raider put on full speed.   A stopping shot  was soon after fired from the bow, a second and third followed.   The raider then stopped and the launch could be heard being hoisted over the side.</p>
<p>Later we caught a glimpse of the latest capture lying off our port beam, a pretty four-masted American schooner.</p>
<p>Her captain, Trudgett, a Nova Scotian, came on board later.</p>
