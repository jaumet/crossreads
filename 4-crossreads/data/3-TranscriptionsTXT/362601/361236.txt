F. Rainbows & rain storms all around the ship.
I read an Author's Daughter in the morning. I write & read all afternoon but I am in a very lonely mood. I go to Lecture on the early History of the Phillistines in Segts mess with Jack Cramer at night. Come down afterwards & write before I go to bed. I have a great test of will & win.

F.Lovely morning. Rain for a time. I watch tug o' war. Try to print Photos. Write after dinner & listen to Lecture on Jerusalem. We sight land as I'm writing to Auntie Annie at 4.30 pm. Boys are very excited. I make a good tea but get very thirsty afterwards. I play cards until Debate on State V private ownership. I go out & pinch mungaree, & eat & promenade. Go to bed 9.30 pm.
