<p>from a packed mass of people which was startling.</p>
<p>I had no idea that so many people existed in Scotland &ndash; (to say nothing of Lieth) - &amp; the huge crowds lining the flag&ndash;draped streets absolutely mobbed us.   I found myself holding a huge box of chocolates which a woman of 40 or so presented with a kiss, &amp; bundles of cigarettes, paper streamers, toy sirens, "ticklers" were all over me.   The women hugged us almost off the lorry, men shook our fists (my hands were both red-raw when we got to the station), a cinema man rushed his camera along to get Teds expression of idiotic ecstasy, &amp; when we finally got into the special train at the station a mob of dear, delightful lassies (porterisses, W.A.A.C.s etc. all got into the carriages &amp; mugged us tell we left.   It was an overpowering welcome &ndash; so unexpected, to warm, and so "real" that it dazed me, quite.</p>
<p>My brief recollection of Scotland, and my very first landing on British soil are too pleasant to be ever forgotten.</p>
