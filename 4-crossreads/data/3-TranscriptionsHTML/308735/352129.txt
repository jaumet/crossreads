<p>After we had unloaded the wagon we played cards until &frac12; Past 2, waiting for the wagon to come back again but it didn't arrive.</p>
<p>Wednesday July 17th<br/>Up at 8 a.m. and got some breakfast ready.  9.30 had a shoot, one of our planes brought down a Fritz balloon in flames.  10.30 Fritz put over some "toot Sweet" stuff, too close to be comfortable.  After dinner went down for a swim in the Lagoon in Heeily.</p>
<p>Thursday July 18th<br/>Had been raining heavy during night.  Another one of Fritz's balloons brought down.  Rained heavy during afternoon, cleared off at night.</p>
<p>Friday July 19th<br/>Our planes worried Fritz all day flying up and down his lines.  They brought down three more of Jerry's balloons (seem to be making a practice of it).  One of Fritz's planes made an attempt to bring one of our balloons down, but came a severe gutzer.</p>
<p>Saturday July 20th<br/>A party came up to relieve us off the guns, got back to the wagon lines just in time to miss dinner.  Made our happy home in a bonza room of a caf&eacute; in Franvilliers.</p>
<p>Sunday July 21st<br/>Started my new job on the feed heap, have 24 Horses and donks to look after and see that they get fed, or in other words I am the "Donks mess orderly".  Put in the afternoon writing letters.</p>
