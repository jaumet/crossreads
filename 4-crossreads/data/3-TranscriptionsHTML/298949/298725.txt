<p>I wher in recipt of a pass, wich usually showed at the gate.  One morning in company of another Germ. Officer named Kahlbaum we left the compound and showed our passes at the gate.  Being about &frac12; a mile away from the camp, and owing the trees and sandhills intervening wher unable to be seen from there.  We heard than a shot fired.  As this wher of daily occurence neither of us toke any notice.  Later Mr Kahlbaum and me separated.  Than I heard another shot fired close by.  Immidiatly after I heard a third shot, and owing the bullet wisling very close pass me, I turned.  I saw the Military guard about 300 yds distant, with one Man, on his Knees taking aim at me with his Rifle.  I walked towards the guard.  The Man in a kneeling position got up and all returned in the direction of the Camp, without waiting for me.  Later I wher joyned again by Kahlbaum.  On our arrival Mr Kahlbaum lodged a complain on our behalf to an Officer getting the reply.  He would see to it.  I never had recieved instructions that I was not.</p>
