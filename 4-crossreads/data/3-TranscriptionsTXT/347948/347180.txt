Parody.Boys of Carmichaels Band
At your request I'll do my bestTo slander all the boysTis partly true and yet forsoothTo tell it often annoysLes Bowra might resort to fightYou know how quick he flaresAnd only Bill can keep him stillThere's nobody else that dares
Boys of Carmichael's BandWhile one of us can standHarmer, Mendel, Snow & DaveWill fight as one on the land or on the waveAnd even Dope will have to leave his clueAnd Scott to Longueville say goodbyeSail away to France to make the Germans danceTo the tune of the Rifle Band
Charlie make a hasty breakTo overlook the shopHarry play his trichord
