and matters of interior economy. Then spent the rest of a blustery afternoon sitting by a fire and reading and writing. After mess walked along dark slushy lanes to 22nd H.Q. and mess and there saw Matthews and others and had a yarn.

He was deeply shocked to find that we had bought 5-5/. worth for issue to leave men. Returned to Bde H.Q. about 10 pm and dealt with a few matters before turning in. A wet cold and windy night ? not much good to the unfortunate people in the trenches.
