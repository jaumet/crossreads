Sunday 7 July
As quiet last night to-day as it was yesterday but cases came through, one buried by our 9.45 mortar falling short, another M.G. bullet. The American left us to-day.
To be relieved to-night.
Monday 8 July
Relieved last night and now at H.Q. Lakreule front where I went for a long walk through Hazebrouck Wallon Cappel. The dog's desease prevalent among the soldiers is also among the civilians many of them are down with it.
