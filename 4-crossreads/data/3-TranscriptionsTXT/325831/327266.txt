3.Well, after I came out (the very next day in fact) General Birdwood came & personally thanked me & sent me off straightaway to England for six days rest. Since I have returned I held a Parade of the whole Brigade & thanked them. They were not all there of course, for many are still lying cold & stark close to the trenches they so gallantly charged, without thought of danger; it was enough for them that I wished it, there was no question, no hanging back. They played their hand & although they went under, they won.
On 31st Dec I am going to the command of a Division with a step in rank & although I am going on & I deeply appreciate the trust that is reposed in me in placing me in command of 20,000 men of all arms on active service, & further, that I realise I am attaining the acme of my military ambition in rising from Bugler in 1874 to Major General commanding a Division in the Field in the greatest War in history, I shall part with very great regret from the Brigade which has always done so well. Well, enough of War. I am sorry when in London I did not call on your cousin Campbell Williams. I only got your letter containing his address on my return to France, but I promise to look him up when I go again.
I send my kindest regards to your wife, Miss Baass, Rita, Miss Foster & to Mr McNamara. Remember me also to the President & Members of the Board & all my brother & sister officers there, to my dear friends Mr Keele & Mr Garrard. Tell them, although strenuously engaged here, I do not forget the good old days in Sydney & their kindness to me. I am sorry that so many connected in one way & another with the Board have gone under here & yet I am not sorry, for after all they were only a bit ahead of their time & it was well worth it & they died game & would do the same again.
The saddle you gave me is worth its weight in gold & every time I climb into it I think of my dear old pal, Harry Williams, & that means a lot to me.
Au revoir, Harry old boy. Good luck & God bless you all.
Your sincere pal
Billie Holmes.
