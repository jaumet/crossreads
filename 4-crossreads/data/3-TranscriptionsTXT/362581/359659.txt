 My darling little Eddy, 
 It will Gun's birthday in the morning. How I wish I was with you. Anyhow I shall think of you   &amp;  picture the morning greeting to dear Grandma. Hope to be with you next time. 
 We have travelled some this   week   &amp;  seen most beautiful country. The crops are really excellent about here   &amp;  cannot imagine it is a war country. Of course it is very quiet here after our last place. 
 the only thing that reminds me of war here is the Troops marching through,   &amp;  the guns being out onto trains.  Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. From Auntie Eadle.
