<p>Anzac<br/>14/12/15<br/>stock of salmon and tinned fruit to get through (Arab chanty:-"Ah lah dis! <u>Chorus</u> Yallah Yallah).</p>
<p>Erected entanglements today right across gully and also laid a rope of barbed wire among undergrowth  keeping it about 2ft 6ins high. In Pedler's dugout after evening stand to arms like  a big cellar 15ft underground. As soon as darkness came, trawlers and other craft some apparently a fair size stood right in under the cliff and the continuous rattle of winches told a story of busy loading. Beachy Bill plugging all the time with well aimed shells, the sound of the gun can be heard very plainly today followed by the scream of the shell and then its explosion. Two fixed lights for naval shooting, shining very brightly from Walkers Ridge. Turkish patrol suspected in front so sent a rocket up at 2030. Except for the usual snipers our patrols encountered, everything seems quiet between the trenches in "No Mans Land". It certainly was rattling and bombing hard on the left during the darkness. Fatigues working all night, tamping &amp;c.</p>
<p>15/12/15<br/>A cold windy morning. When day broke the sun came out and made the white caps of the rough sea look very pretty. Two large white hospital ships close inshore, the cargo boats going to Suvla during the day. Brigade Major and Staff  Captain in, talking and we are thinking of our second line of defence and its problems of ammunition supply &amp;c. Surplus jam tin bombs ready to be dumped in  a choice spot where  no one would undergo the unpleasant job of fishing them out. Very heavy rumbling cannonade the other side of the peninsula. No 75's  today. "Dinkum oil" received and 1600 and I volunteered for the job of being the last to leave this position when they do go. Stores &amp;</p>
