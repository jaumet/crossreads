<p>Being without news from you and our children is my great trouble.</p>
<p>Hardships dont matter much.<br/>Have chapters to write to you and dear Mother soon as spare time comes<br/>Now none of you must be anxious about me for my eleventh hour luck is still a mercy which a good providence extends.<br/>Many soldiers have strong faith in simple charms they carry and by them they come through. Mine is one which cannot be lost &ndash; the presence of my Mother and sometimes dreams of my Father and of Norman<br/>I send to Bert &amp; his wife the most kindly wishes for a happy peaceful life. Tell our dear children and dear Mother I will be home soon as duty allows</p>
