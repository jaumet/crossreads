<p>(3)<br/>Enlistment.</p>
<p>On 6th May 1916 I signed the enlistment papers (after having been previously rejected in 1915) and on 20th June went by train from Byron Bay (where I was then working) to Lismore for medical examination.  On this occasion Dr Bignell passed me without even examining me, as he could see that I was eager to enlist and men were badly needed.  On 14th July I again went to Lismore and was sworn in.  Resigned my position in N.C. Co-Op Coy Ltd Byron Bay and was given various farewells and presentations by my friends.  Then went home to South Grafton and spent a few days with my parents and afterwards went by steamer to Sydney and down to Jervis Bay Lighthouse for a week to spend a holiday with the Lighthouse keeper and his family.  Afterwards took steamer from Sydney to Byron Bay and then train to Brisbane.</p>
<p>In Camp</p>
<p>I reported at the Drill Hall Brisbane and next day (10th August 1916) went by train from Brisbane to Enoggera and marched into camp at Fraser's Paddock.  About sixty of us marched in that morning &ndash; dressed in our civilian clothes and carrying our ports &amp;c.  We were greeted from the men in camp as we marched in, with various welcomes, such as "you'll be sorry you joined the army" &amp;c.  I didn't know anyone but soon made friendships, some of which will remain for life.  Our civilian clothes were taken from us and we were each issued with a suit of blue dungarees, flannels, blutcher boots, white hat, two blankets, and knife, fork, spoon, plate and mug.  We were then portioned out into tents (twelve in each) and our names entered down, each of us losing our identity and in future being known as a number.  I was "J" 16242 of "A" Company.  We were given our first inoculation and then allowed to roam about the camps for two days.  The various camps (Fraser's paddock, Bell's paddock, and Rifle Range) were well laid out.  Huts to sleep in were under construction, which eventually did away with the tents and we had large sheds (holding 300 or more) in which to have our meals.  There were good recreation huts in which were pianos, billiard tables &amp;c (managed by the Y.M.C.A., Salvation Army and Church of England).  A White City was constructed for the troops' amusements.  It had a picture show (free) boxing hall, resturants &amp;c.  Concert parties came out almost every night from Brisbane and we used frequently to get leave to visit Brisbane.  After three days in camp I was appointed a clerk at the Quarter Master's store, which of course exempted me from guard and drilling.  I spent three weeks here (during which time I got vaccinated) and I took sick and was removed to Hospital where I remained a fortnight and was then sent to the Convalescent Hospital &ndash; "Staghorn" &ndash; on the beach at Southport, to recuperate.  Returned back to hospital again and was discharged and sent back to camp on 12th October.  On 20th October my brother Charlie entered camp and I was glad to see him.  I was then given final leave and left for Grafton, arriving there on 3rd November and returning to camp again on 13th</p>
