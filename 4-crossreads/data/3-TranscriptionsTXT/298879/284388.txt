June 1915Wednesday 9Fine. Had a good night's rest last night without being disturbed except having to stand to arms from 3 to 4 A.M. the usual thing. We are very inactive so far as fighting goes and I am wondering what it is to end up with. Back to fire trench again tonight.
Thursday 10Fine.  We exchanged shots a treat with the Turks last night. They have a very formidable barb-wire fence in front of part of their trench.Left fire trench again this evening. Our guns kicking up a row again. Brown's Battery especially. This life is getting very monotonous.
