 28-4-16 Fri 28th We received a pay again today &amp; the two-up school was in full swing before the paying was finished;  An order was issued to each village (48 of them) last night to supply 50 men from each to build roads &amp; bridges across the Canal for the troops 4 miles this side of Ezbet-Sit-Houm, as the country the troops are camped on now at Ezbet will be flooded in a month or so;  The troops at Ezbet-Sit-Houm were told that they will be here for a considerable time, &amp; there is some talk of a road &amp; line being made out into the desert, where the Armoured Cars now are stationed; 
 Bassan came down here for a ride today;  Went in for a dip after tea &amp; played cards as usual till bed time
