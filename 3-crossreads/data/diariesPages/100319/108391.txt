much and the companies were led to so many yards of muddy trench and that is where the chaps had to sleep. So they all dug little places and could lie down. Old Tom Burrage came up with his transport later and before the night is out we hope to have the boys blankets up. My H.Q. is quite a wonderful place deep down concreted and has a trapdoor connecting it with further chambers of concrete below. A fear that perhaps it is mined assails me!! The men's blankets came up about 11 p.m. and saved them from having a wretchedly cold night although it was bad enough. We had a quiet night except for a few stray shells. On our direct right the cathedral at St Quentin can be seen though the rest of the city is hidden by the hills. Great rumours of Lille falling etc.
