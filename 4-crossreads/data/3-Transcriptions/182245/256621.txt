<p>16 MONDAY</p>
<p>Fine all day but came on to</p>
<p>rain in evening. We left</p>
<p>Steenwerck about 9 AM &amp;</p>
<p>passed through Bailleul</p>
<p>Strazeele &amp; Hazebruck</p>
<p>&amp; arrived at Wallen [Chapelle?]</p>
<p>about 3.30 pm &amp; picketed</p>
<p>the horses in open. We</p>
<p>slept in a barn again on</p>
<p>straw. We see signs of</p>
<p>spring all along the</p>
<p>road but its still very cold.</p>
