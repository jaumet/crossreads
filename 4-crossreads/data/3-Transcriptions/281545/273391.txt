<p>before &amp; had all the Roof blown in &amp; one side blown out, there were nobody inside at the time.   After making a good run I arrived in Peselhoek for Dinner.   My luck was in as they were having a splendid Dinner which I soon obtained some.  On handing in a plate &amp; mess tin I received some Roast Beef &amp; Potatoes also Plum Pudding &amp; Rum Sauce which was just A.1. I thoroughly enjoyed it &amp; after a little while I made my way into Poperinghe.  As there were no Motor Wagons going in I had to walk the 1 &frac12; miles &amp; arrived there at 8 Pm.   I went along to my Belgian Friends to wish them A Happy New Year &amp; found them all well, the Young Lady there made me a splendid Cup of Coffee &amp; I was invited to stop &amp; have Tea with them.  After having a chat with the young Lady &amp; her brother Tea was served at 4 Pm, I had some boiled Pork &amp; Bread &amp; Butter &amp; some Belgian Milk Bread which was very nice also instead of Cocoa I had two cups of Chocolate. I take off my hat to the Belgian &amp; French People for their Cooking, the Chocolate was delicious &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My chum came in after me &amp; arrived at the house at 4-30 Pm &amp; he also was invited to Tea which he enjoyed, we both remained</p>
