<p>sail in the morning and so on</p>
<p>March 23rd at 7 A.M. we arrived off San Juan and patrolled in the vicinity all day, we were not able to see much as we were a good way off, only a very hilly island it appeared to be similar to the others.</p>
<p>March 24th at 2.30 A.M. USS. Evelyn came out from San Juan, and we intercepted her and we then learned that German steamer was still in port, but that she attempted to leave a couple of day previously minus her clearance papers, and was in consequence prevented from doing so by port authorities</p>
<p>March 26th  at 2.30 A.M. we departed, as we then were informed that the Authorities were taking necessary action against the German captain of the S.S. Odenwold (the vessel in question) for attempting to break out of harbour, whilst a American gunboat took over patrolling duties from us, and so we shaped our course for southern islands for a change<br/>At 3 P.M. after cruising around Dutch island <strike>we entered St Thomas harbour</strike></p>
