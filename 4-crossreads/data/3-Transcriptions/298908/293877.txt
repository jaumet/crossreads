<p>relief to get hold of a book that's well in credit.<br/>A few of us got a bit of a shock after coming off parade today, just before they dismissed us the Sgt. Major called out a few names to fall out &amp; report to the Orderly Room &amp; among them was mine so up we goes.  It turns out to be the report of us catching the wrong train at Paddington 5 weeks ago when the "Jacks" took our names.  We should have travelled by the 6 p.m. instead of the 12 p.m., however the case was very simple because the authorities down this end failed to warn us so old Woods could do nothing else but dismiss us, but just fancy the mongrels sending that charge in after all that time &amp; on such a paltry charge but what else can one expect of the wasters.  These are generally the sort of things the "Jacks" go in for, if they caught the real wasters in our Army they would not be too</p>
