<p>9 February, 1916<br/>We left early &amp; I had a lively ride home as the mare knew that she was homeward bound &amp; was anxious to get on, we had several little quarrels on the way &amp; I think we were about even on it. We got paid during the afternoon &amp; as there was a pass to spare I took advantage of it &amp; went into Cairo.  I received some letters before going in &amp; some more when I got back &ndash; nearly all the boys were full on it &amp; when I got back there was trouble brewing. One of the pickquet got drunk &amp; was put in the gaurd tent &amp; the Corporal of the pickquet was also put under arrest &ndash; They are treating old Beuzeville rotten, they had one Corporal to many in the Squadron &amp; told him that his promotion was not confirmed so he had to revert to the ranks &amp; Corp Cameron came into the troop.</p>
