<p>a French Madamoiselle (or Madame).  I won't promise she'll be fair or even young but she will be a good cook.</p>
<p>Or shall I just kidnap one &amp; bring her out without marrying her.  I don't mean to be shocking.  But they are as a rule, most divine cooks.</p>
<p>I'm glad you heard from Jock Ellis.  I haven't seen him yet.  Haven't seen the Macnamara boys or Duncan or anyone except old Joe Ruby &amp; I hear that since then he's been to Hospital.</p>
<p>I am being yelled for so must flee.  My love to Mac &amp; the dear old boss &amp; Graham &amp; your very precious self.  Please don't be too reckless even if things are dull &amp; slow at times.</p>
<p>Yours ever<br/>Jim Wilkie</p>
