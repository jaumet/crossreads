<p>Gallipolli<br/>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sept 1915<br/>My dear Sister,<br/>This one as you will see by the above is from the "disturbance". I arrived back four days ago &amp; things are very much changed since I made my debut, then it was the landing &amp; fight where you could without cover communication &amp; other conveniences necessary for successful warfare, now we are consolidated having fine trenches support trenches etc. good roads up from the beach, in fact everything 18 carat. The trench we are in at present the boys captured a month ago from "Johnny T" the name the Turk goes by here. As you will notice by the envelope we are put on our honour not to write anything else but personal matters, so I will have to cease from writing in the foregoing strain.<br/>We are fairly comfortable here the food isnt bad &amp; we get good tea, in the cooking line every man is his own chef as far as sidelines like bacon eggs &amp; an occassional steak are concerned we get bacon every day &amp; the latter two sometimes, the last time we had eggs the ration</p>
