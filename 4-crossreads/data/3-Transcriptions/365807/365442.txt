<p>Third spasm</p>
<p>11.6.17</p>
<p>Had a most interesting day. Lunched with Miss Sinclair, who, if possible, is    <strike>Scotched</strike>  Scotcher than ever - &amp; talk!  though my speech is rather unformed just at present, you wouldn't have noticed it.</p>
<p>During the afternoon, an officer who received ten pieces of the shell that got me dropped in to enquire about my health. We discussed some of the things  I was trying to tell him in the trench, which didn't appear to me at the time to be quite plain. These affairs are awfully funny to live over again, though uncomfortable in the initial reading.</p>
<p>I called on Maj &amp; Mrs Skirving who were out, so had to cadge tea from Miss Bowen whom I am telling mother all about.</p>
<p>Love to all &amp; kindest regards to Mr O'Reilly<br/>Your loving son<br/>Keith<br/>P.S. Your cable arrived on my birthday</p>
