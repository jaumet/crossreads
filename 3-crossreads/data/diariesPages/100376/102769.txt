the Germans broke through and we had to go back to a place called Hondeghem. A fortnight in Hondeghem we had to make a very hurried retreat to a place called Blendecques. Three months in Blendecques we went back to our old place at Hondeghem ? From there we were shifting to St. Venant when we got the order that 1914 men are to go back to Australia on leave.
