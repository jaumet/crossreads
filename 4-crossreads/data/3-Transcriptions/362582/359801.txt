<p>a Kimono for you three &amp; a shawl for mother, which I intended bringing home but must send them now. Hope you will like them. Three or four of us are going out to afternoon tea to Fred's camp this week. I'm enclosing a few snapshots, taken by on of Fred's Officers out at the camp before they went away. Matron is the very tall one. I shall write their names on the back. I think you may be interested to see my photos, so am sending them to you. When I return I shall get a book to put them in, so mind you take care of them. I must try and get some little novelty for Eddy but it is very hard to buy things for a boy. I'm enclosing a couple of silk handkerchiefs, most brilliant colouring worked on them, given to me by two of my poor wounded soldier boys. Tell Eddy I shall tell him all about Donkeys when I return, it is very hard to make them go</p>
