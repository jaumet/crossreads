 Capt Hale, Please let me know if I will be able to procure a new Garland Mortar as the one we have does not throw the Garland bombs the distance which it should. The Corporal in Charge has reported to me that in making up the Garland Bombs he has to use 7 Drams of powder for a charge in place of the 5 drams (the recognised quantity of powder).  Therefore we require extra powder to provide sufficient charges for the number of bombs in stock.
