beach a large number of bathing boxes & machines are being used to accommodate patients and I'm sure they "wouldn't leave their little wooden huts for anyone".Sund 23rd July (10pm) :-Yesterday evening I went for a walk over to Wimille 11/2  kilometres from Wimereux railway station & a very pretty walk too along a narrow white road bordered by green fields & rural cottages, past pretty meadows, over a bridge, along a fine avenue  flanked by tall trees into the quiet village. Here I bought some postcards of Wimille & la vallee from my hunchback friend and then retraced my steps. From the bridge over the Wimereux where it passes through Wimille I stood for a few minutes to watch 2 enthusiastic fishermen (English officers) with rod & line playing for trout & other fish.
