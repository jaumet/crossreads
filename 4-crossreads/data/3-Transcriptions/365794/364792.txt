<p>Saturday 12th '18 [October]<br/>Off duty 2-5.  "Floo" has me in its grip &amp; I am only struggling on to try to dodge the Sick room if possible.  Pts. are very ill with it &amp; sisters going down daily &ndash; 56 pts., 2 sisters &amp; 1 orderly in this stuffy ward &amp; with another heat spasm when it seemed almost gone, is proving too much for us in D. i.  One pt. "Welsh Band" boy died suddenly 4 a.m. with pleurisy &amp; heart.<br/>Ward very heavy.</p>
<p>Sunday, 13th<br/>Matron presented me with a "day off" so I lie &amp; suffer by myself all day.  T. 101.6, head splitting, breakfast brought but V.A.D. omits to report me to Home sister so I lie until 4 p.m. then get cup tea, then alas! 9 p.m. transferred to "Sick Sisters", 4 women already there!!!</p>
