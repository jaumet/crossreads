 Beautiful &amp; sunny. Left Hazebruck 
 about 7 AM &amp; came through 
 Baileull &amp; Steenwerck to our 
 waggon lines near Steenwerck 
 They are good stables but rotten 
 billets. I took the gun up to 
 our new position halfway 
 between Fleurbaix &amp; Chappelle 
 Armenti&egrave;res. Its not a bad 
 posie but might be better.
