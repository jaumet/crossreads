<p>I was glad to get your nice little letter today with Mums, &amp; to hear you had been so nice down at Cronulla, &amp; helped the people while Mum went home. These houses have roofs made of straw, &amp; aren't they done nicely? Good night with lots of love &amp; kisses from Dad<br/>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
