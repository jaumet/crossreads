morning by a French Gamekeeper. As soon as the crews arrived two of our fellows Austin another, Ridley, went out with Rifles but could not find the Froggy. If they did I firmly believe they woud have shot him dead. Steve has been buried a Cross is being made for him. I am still roosting in my Bunk. Cannot put my foot to the ground.

My Foot is still bad, but I can hobble around with a stick. I was called up for orderly room to-day informed that I would have to go to Hospital as we are going to move in two or three days I will not be able to march. I said nothing but intend to hang out until I am kicked out.

There is a "Purphy" floating about to the effect that the 1st 4th Divisions are out on strike. The yarn runs that after they arrived about Strasbourg they were put on Salvaging Barbed Wire. They soon got sick of that knocked off saying they had captured enough prisoners to do all that. For punishment they were sent on a 12 miles route march. After reaching their destination they were ordered to march back but refused: finally motor lorries were sent out to bring them back.

The ancle is still very weak but I managed to walk half way to St. Ouen yesterday.
With reference to the above mentioned "Purfy" I don't believe the 1st 4th Divs. reached Strasbourg at all.
