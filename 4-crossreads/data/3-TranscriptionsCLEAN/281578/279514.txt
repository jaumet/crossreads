7 from Elsie, & 1 each from Will, Nin & Mone. They were full of interesting news, & it took me nearly till midnight to digest them. The chaps around me are snoring, bar a happy party who are talking & laughing, happy & half shick after partaking of much vin banc. Friday 24 May I was told to attend at a N.C.O's class today, it lasts 6 days. There are 16 corporals at it. The 4 of us from D Coy reported at B.O.R., & were told to go to the hangars to the battalion parade ground. Over we went to the hangars in the green field, & the 14th Bn were there, no sign of our lot; we looked round, sat down, then returned to the village, & found our battalion were in a field on the other side. It was a glorious site, the clover was thick with flowers, & red poppies grew amongst the green grass, & lovely green trees waved in the breeze. I had to smile when we turned up at the school, they started on left & right turn, & sloping arms by numbers. A Lt is in charge. Some of the chaps have been in the trenches a long time & are pretty rotten on their detail, but I've had so much of this stuff, I know it off by heart. It rained & we didn't go out in the afternoon. After tea
