<p>put in about 6 hrs in the train.</p>
<p>As usual arrangements were defective but finally things got settled &amp; had a good night's rest</p>
<p>Tuesday 26th<br/>Revielle at 6.15 (what a change from 5 am) &amp; fooled about all day on fatigues &amp; getting camp in decent order. Continually tired today the last few days tearing around evidently requiring a little rest.</p>
<p>Wednesday 27th<br/>Mess orderly today but for a change was rather busy. Had a little time off to write. Rather wet day though the King inspected the 3rd Divisional and other Australian &amp; New Zealand men. There were 45,000 men inspected I believe &amp; there was a fine parade</p>
<p>Thursday 28th<br/>General fatigues clearing up again and nothing worth noting with exception of it being a fine day. Rumours re 4 days leave &amp; a move to France are becoming current. Writing in evening &amp; posted mail</p>
<p>Friday 29th<br/>Made a mounted number &amp; had to work at stables This is slightly promising but evolves extra work. On horse picket at night but had easy time</p>
<p>Saturday 30<br/>Owing to being on horse picket I was not on first parade. Rest of the day holiday owing to sports. Walked to camp of German prisoners &amp; saw them building a road</p>
