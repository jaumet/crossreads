<p>We saw the Old Bailey and spent the morning looking round.<br/>At dinner time I was given an invitation to a tea party at a rich lady's flat at Kensington.<br/>I took a taxi for which the lady paid and got very well treated.  The best of cakes etc <br/>cigarettes were in abundance, and 2 professional entertainers were engaged so that we <br/>had a grand time.  Among the guests was a lieutenant who had just won the Military <br/>Cross and everybody of course had much pleasure</p>
