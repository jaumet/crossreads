Very amusing to hear our veterans pulling their legs. They anticipate a rest but I doubt whether 130 will make very much difference as tunnelling is progressing apace and over 1500 bags of spoil removed daily. Went down to secret post in "D" Co overlooking German officers and searched the place with telescope but could detect no movements of any sort. Returned to lunch. Went down to secret post in "A" Co with Drummond Curnow and had telescope over the whole place. Saw a few Turks working and marvelled exceedingly at the strength and amount of labour expended in their trenches, probably a lot of the work is done by civilian gangs of Armenians under taskmasters. 
Received Kitchener's message. My advice is "dig". Went on to Lone Pine trenches saw Capt Parkes and Frawley. Good deal of head cover. In one place they are directly opposite to 22nd trenches and it was novel to see our own trenches just as the Turks see them. They are marvellously neat and clean looking compared with their irregular lines but this very regularity has its serious drawbacks.
Artillery started 75's flying round passed through several posts wrecked with shrapnel so took shelter underground in tunnel until bombardment ceased. Going back found reinforcements wondering what sort of a place this was with so much ironmongery hurtling about. Saw Foote in 23rd lines. Glorious sunset
