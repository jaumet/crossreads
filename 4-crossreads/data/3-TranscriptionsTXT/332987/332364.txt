 [Transcriber's note:  This is the fifth and final diary of Farrier Sergeant Thomas Edward Goodwin.  He continues his descriptions of the action around him and is also interested in news that comes from other areas.  He is in hospital with pneumonia in March, spends some time in Boulogne convalescing and then is back in the action at Borre.  His unit moves fairly regularly but is generally in the Somme area.  In his description of the shelling and bombardments taking place he describes it as "simply Hell let loose".  On 22 September 1918 he is advised to proceed the next day to Australia on leave and following a train journey of 8 days he arrives at Taranto, Italy to board the Ormonde and proceed to Kantarah and eventually on to Suez.  On 10 October he boards the Port Sydney and arrives back in Sydney on 4 December 1918.]
