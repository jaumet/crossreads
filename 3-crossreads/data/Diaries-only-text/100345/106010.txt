some more Lithgowites in the new "Reinfs.": the shell fire lately has been terrific: relieved by the 45th about 6 pm went back to sausage gully: Fritz put over some gas other shells we were glad to move off again: our Coy has suffered: four left in our section only about 70 of us who went in are left in our Coy altough a lot are only slightly wounded: Alf was wounded today so that only leaves McCrop, Reg, self out of our "mob": marched towards Albert bivouaked: towards midnight as we were nicely asleep a few shells came over landed close then a "rush"came a shell landed right in the midst of us: our four "bearers"had a stretcher for our pillow it was not two yards from the edge of the shell hole while dozens (including F Poole) were just as close: we were covered with dirt (another miracle) no one was wounded although one poor beggar had his head blown off : we then went into a trench close by cuddled together till morning: a good few shells came over but none got into the trench: Fritz must only have been firing at random: a couple of horses next to our lines were also killed:
