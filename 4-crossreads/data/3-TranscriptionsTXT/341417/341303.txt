 Fear of God, Endurance of Earthly Hardships, opens the Hearts of the Wicked and gives Knowledge to all. R.T.W. May be you think I am getting a bit of a psalm singer more-or less, but I cannot help being a little insane, at times I consider the Fijian has more brains and common-sense in his simple life than my civilised educated Fast life.

 I remain Your Affectionate Brother R. T. Wharton.
