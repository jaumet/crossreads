<p>I noticed a rather remarkable thing on parade this morning it was in connection with the band, every morning without fail while we are waiting to move off from the parade ground the men are constantly kicking up a row sparring, sitting down, or talking like old women in fact doing everything that they should not do &amp; its impossible to keep them quiet, but this morning whether by accident or design I know not the band stopped quite close to us &amp; played some very nice tunes &amp; all the time the music was on they stood as quiet as the oldest &amp; most disciplined soldiers could have, I could not help remembering that old couplet, "Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast" for here was a very good case in point.<br/>This afternoon all the Sgts &amp; W.O.s</p>
