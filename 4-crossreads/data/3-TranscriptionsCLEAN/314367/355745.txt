  
 The Maringa is also in & will carry troops so you see our small world is in a ferment of excitement - It's a man's world & a man's life - Shouting - sweating - swearing men shifting camp & all in the cheeriest of moods - Still there is a cloud - that raising the price of drinking in Sydney - that's one below the belt both Tommy & the Bluejacket are agreed upon - We shall have a tremendous lot of hard work before we get away but Rabaul "aint the blanky Garden of Eden" as one hand remarked = 
 Thursday - Feb 4-15  Out at sea - Patrol duty - Went out at 4.30 am - Back in 24 hours - It's 2.30 pm & I've been at work since 8.30 - clearing up patients, getting things in order - We have shifted some 40 men to the Una & every damned ullage the Una had is aboard us - One blanky ruffian said he'd come to be 'tuk' to Sydney medically - He's doing full duty in the stoke hole & will stop till he drops - They've struck the wrong ship if they fancy they're fooling round in a motor car - Sitting back & enjoying the scenery - If I say they're fit for work they've got to or go to prison - Splendid - when half the blighters are Sydneys loafers & larrikins - Mr Bumpus says 'As a variety show it beats the 'White City' easy'.
