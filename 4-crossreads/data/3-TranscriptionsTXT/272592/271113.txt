Platoon & 8 from A Coy. with the usual military style they directed us wrongly & I had some difficulty in finding the right place however after a lot of enquiries I reached it at last, the yard is a big one & has sawmills & etc. going a lot of Belgians are employed in it, the party was split up into sections for the various jobs they were wanted for such as removing stakes, timber, unloading G.S. waggon
