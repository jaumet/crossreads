  
 142 am Captain of the day but try to get leave for France & at leave office find an old Cpl of the Fieldmarshall & everything is fixed up but I must call for pass to morrow. 
 11-5-19 (Sun) Collect pass - big robberies of officers gear discovered this morning. My hat was stolen & then replaced. Otherwise I am intact. I pick up my pass & sail off with Thompson by afternoon train arriving in London at 7.45 pm after waiting nearly 2 hours at Westbury. 
 At Carlton Gardens find that leave officer has moved & we inquire at Regent Palace. These have no rooms for 3 mos but send us to a place Park House 16 & 17 Bayswater Tce, overlooking the Kensington Gardens & kept by an Austrian (once) named Hardy 
 The search for this place involves some effort as houses here are divided into sections & each section is numbered on its own. So that numbers may be running down & suddenly you get a heavy throwback & as usual London people are too stupid to explain anything & police we could not find. People are too respectable here perhaps. We find light refreshments nearby & then to bed. 
 12-5-19 (Mon) As we are both going to France we set off for Horseferry road for our passports
