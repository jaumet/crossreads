F.Major has liver & makes all the others buzz around. Go to Boo-Keeping. Sleep downstairs on the floor. I go in Crib Tourney & miss first round we fasten Ports as Gale is expected. We are warned to parade come on deferred pay.
Sit in Oper Theatre & read M's letters. I am very much overcome.

Go to bed on seat & pack myself in like a parcel about midnight. Arise at 6 am & have K bustle. Music makes me very thoughtful about my chere solin. Lecture on deciduous fruits.
