  Wednesday 16 May 1917.  &nbsp;  
 Still at sea and still no sight of land. Spent a better day &amp; feeling almost right again.&nbsp; 
 Everyone still a little more brighter. Wrote 1 letter in afternoon and with ship rolling &nbsp;heavily upsetting plates. knives forks from shelves. 
 Wind not so strong &amp; sea not&nbsp; quite &nbsp;so rough. 
 We are now over&nbsp; 500 miles from&nbsp; land&nbsp; usual route &nbsp;down in the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot; Very rough weather indeed. Are well out of sight of any shipping of any description along Sth coast of Australia
