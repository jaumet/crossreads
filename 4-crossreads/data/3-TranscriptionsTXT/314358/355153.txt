 April 1917 Note for Sheila The butterfly I sent with Corfe Caslte book for mother was the first I saw this spring. 
 I was on the ancient Roman wall of earth which surrounds Wareham one day and saw Brimstone settle on the tangle of a hedge at foot of the wall. Down I went and made poor Brimstone a prisoner, but I didn't like the job at all. It seemed rather cruel. 
 Her whiskers were both fine at first but one is now broken. 
 There is a splendid book in this institute on Butterflies and the colored plates in it are the best I have seen. 
 I enclose extract about the Brimstone sent to you. 
 Keep on with your nature studies you and Ernie 
 Love to you all
