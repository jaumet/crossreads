<p>Thursday</p>
<p>Light rain this morning breaks up parade. Do nothing much all morning. Fatigue work in aft. Tony falls into creek. Joy unbounded. After tea write to Miss Barbara &amp; send postcard to Cis. Also wrote to Edie Watts.<br/>Take our usual stroll round beach.  Weather somewhat cold. Sergt. Barr reads us extracts from an officer at the Front to his people. Very fine literature &amp; full of human feeling.  Barr a good reader.</p>
