concentration of ordnance ammunition dumps. If the weather will but hold favorable we should be able to deliver a crushing blow, as there is no limit to guns or ammunition. All are keenly anxious and alert for the coming battle. I reached the 54th Battery of 8 in Howitzers, Major Macdonald, took a series of pictures of his battery. [No 14] One realises the impossibility of rapid advance, [No 49] even should be able to break through the Bosh lines: for the weight of these titanic weapons makes them so cumbrous as to be practically regarded as fixtures. 
Whilst I was overlooking the battery a number of the enemy Gotha machines came over on the scout we immediately opened fire with our anti-aircraft guns. As far as I could see they escaped, the sky being very cloudy so that they were able to play hide seek amongst the clouds. Aerial activity again this evening.
