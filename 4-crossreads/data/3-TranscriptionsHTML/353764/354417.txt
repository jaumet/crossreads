<p>we have taken over horses &amp; Waggons &amp; are now going to start Hard work.<br/>Have heard that we move again to France in a fortnights time</p>
<p>4.3.16. Saturday<br/>Had a hard days work in the Transport line.  Sending out Waggons at all manner of times.  I have now got a good convoy on an all night trip to Mahdi.<br/>We are pretty well settled now, but only for a short time.  They are trying to equip the Company as fast as possible so as to get it away &amp; I have great hopes of going into France with a Commission which will be OK for me.<br/>We have a lively lot of Horses, as good as can be had &amp; I hope we take them away with us.</p>
<p>5.3.16 Sunday<br/>Plenty of work to do.  The men who were not on transport went to Church Service, but I was not able to get away.<br/>Jack found me <strike>yeste</strike> to-day after tramping miles &amp; it was funny to listen to some of his expressions.<br/>I went up the Town with a few of the Sergeants to the Empire Club, which is run</p>
