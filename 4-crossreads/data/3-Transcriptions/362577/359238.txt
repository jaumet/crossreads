<p>three weeks ago.  It was only four days but made a nice break.  Jack &amp; I had a day in London, saw as much as could be seen in the time, went to "High Jinks" at the Adelphi, then he went to Kent &amp; I went up to Southwold on the East Coast and stayed with relations, the first of the English ones I've met.  They all live too far from camp to visit in an ordinary weekend.  After Winchester we do find Lark Hill a hole.  In Winchester we had a home to go to and that makes an enormous difference.  Last Saturday Jack &amp; I spent the afternoon in Salisbury, took a few snaps, had a good wander round and at night went to "Potash and Perlmutter" which at times was very funny.  Aeroplanes are very thick here.  One dare devil loops the loop continually over our camp.  He does circus tricks nearly every night.  They seem very safe.  Well must get into the blankets in preparation for Georgie to-morrow.</p>
