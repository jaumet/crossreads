enough for me to get home to my Dear people, No mistake this is the place that makes you think of homeI am sorry you had no luck at the races. Wanted me there. I was thinking of them on the days they were run.Envelopes are scarce so am enclosing notes to Waugh & McKinnon. See they get them.I suppose everything is pretty hard in Sydney. Never mind lets hope is will soon end. We will do our best & I can tell you they don't like us to mix it.Give my kind regards to all friends & say I will meet them at my welcome home.Hoping you are all well & Cheer up the old Tom is doing well With all my love & kissesYour loving SonTom.
