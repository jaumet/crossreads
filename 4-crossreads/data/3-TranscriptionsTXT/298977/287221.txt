 France, 11th April 1916. 
 My dear Mother, 
 We are now on the way to the trenches again, having just finished a March of nearly 40 miles.  It took us two days to do it, but we rather enjoyed it as we had a good reception at the numerous Villages we passed through.  The only trouble was the hard roads which played up with our feet, as we had done no March ing for some time and what we had done was on the Desert. 
 Have not got the same mixed feelings about going into Action here as I had when we landed on Gallipoli.  From all accounts the life is very much easier than over there, and one thing at any rate we will get here which was unknown on the Peninsular, that is a spell out of the trenches after a certain time in.  From all accounts too our little section of the Army has a very easy time. 
 Hope I get a chance to get to England.  Suppose we will get leave after a time.  Harry and I intend going together if we can.  He has a lot of relations over there and we are looking forward to a good time. 
 Received a Newspaper Cutting from Father in the mail we had at the last billet, but no letters from home.  The boys over here are absolutely disgusted with the way the fellows are behaving in Sydney.  I pity them when they get over here if they ever intend coming. 
 Had two letters from Ruby in Brisbane in this mail.  Hope the trip did her good.  Also a note from Os in Egypt. 
 Hope all are O.K. at home and round about. 
 Love from Your loving Son, Roy.
