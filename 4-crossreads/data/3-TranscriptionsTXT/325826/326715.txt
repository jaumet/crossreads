5.  been held and it was a great success.  I don't know who is loaning them the church, but it is rather beautiful inside & there is quite a fine pipe-organ in it and it was really a treat to have some decent Sunday music again.  Of course the service was started really for soldiers and I suppose there were not more than a dozen civilians present, and about a hundred & fifty soldiers.  It made quite a fine congregation & the whole service had a nice tone about it, Mr Stirling is a beautiful spirited man & I thought the same of Mr Grieves in the morning too.  Just loved all three services that I was at to-day, though to-night's seemed the most homey perhaps.     I was just trying to settle down for the evening without hating my own presence too much when a delightful surprise arrived in the shape of my sweetheart; he had gone without mess so as to come & I could have yelled with joy at sight of him.  I managed to get some dinner for him for it was not quite our dinner hour when he arrived, so all was well & we had a lovely little time together.  The last tram to Ras-el-tin leaves at 9.30 so he left in time to catch that.Even if I had to go back to Australia to-morrow it would have been worth the money & the trip to have seen this much of him.  You may have me come wandering back soon after all.  There is a good deal of talk of sending back officers' wives but whether it will come to the point we do not know yet.  I shall come back cheerfully if that is the verdict.          We just heard the news to-day of the sinking of the Persia: so terrible it all is though we get very few details.  The papers are very meagre.
