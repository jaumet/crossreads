He took it to his tent and asked the chap "Snow" what to do with it: Snow didn"t know and Nick wasn"t certain if it was to be used dissolved on a wash or taken internally: he decided on the last &ndash; and swallowed it. This was about 11.30 pm. 
 "You ---- fool!" says Snow, "do you know what you"ve done &ndash; you"ve swallowed poison!" Nick made one long dive to the nearest doctor"s tent. Since then he"s supposed to have sworn off women &ndash; he"ll have his work cut out &ndash; if he goes many times to Marseille.

 10. Roachie has been disillusioned; one evening he "hooked" a girl in the village who proved herself square:  the next evening again she proved herself as Marguerite and Roachie began to laud her virtue over the camp: the third evening was exciting but after it he was more full than ever over having been the only man in the unit to meet a square girl.
