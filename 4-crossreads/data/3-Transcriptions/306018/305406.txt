<p>February. March 1917<br/>Wednesday 28th<br/>Had another easy day. Got several papers.  Wrote letters 1 to Doug &amp; one home.  The Rail head is out here now.  They are laying about 1 mile per day so we expect to be on the move forward very soon again.</p>
<p>Thursday March 1st<br/>Went over to the Regiment &amp; got paid  The YMCA have  started a canteen, but it is nearly 2 miles from our camp.</p>
<p>Friday 2nd<br/>The Brigade went out early &amp; occupied Khan Yunis without opposition.  They got a few prisoners.  The enemy only fired a couple of big shells which seemed to come from a long distance  This Sheikh Zowaiid is a big camp now &amp; the railway is being pushed on at great speed.</p>
<p>Saturday 3rd<br/>Went over to the canteen to get some things.  There was an enormous crowd of troops there lined up &amp; it seemed hopeless.  However a 5PT tip to the Tommy military policeman fixed things up &amp; we didn't have much of a wait.  There was a splendid surf &amp; in the afternoon we went in.  The water was great.  Had a good gallop along the beach afterwards.</p>
