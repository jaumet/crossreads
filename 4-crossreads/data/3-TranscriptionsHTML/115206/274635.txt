<p>March 1918</p>
<p>Messines<br/>Really, a fairly busy day, aeriel activity having first place, and artillery next. Seemed as if Fritz was preparing for a little stunt &ndash; poor old Fritz what a shock he will get. <br/>Knipe &ndash; alias Lightning arrived at P-t with Percy Grayling to relieve Garfott, yesterday. <br/>Big fatigue party working about the line, they seem pretty busy. Shells fell in several co-ordinated spots fairly handy, one did a little damage. Paid Geo Baker and Mick a visit during evening.</p>
