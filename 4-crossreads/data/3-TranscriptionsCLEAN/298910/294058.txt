fell in on top of them, all were bruised, but no bones broken - Next morning they had the dug out fixed up again & with a big notice "Do drop in Dug Out" - Went for a walk as it was quiet into the Town of "Fleurbaix", nearly every building is more or less wrecked must have been some very heavy street fighting as a lot of houses are barricaded & loopholed for the machine Guns. The Church was intact till the first week of August, it is now like most of the other just a mass of debris - I got some of the glass from behind the altar as a Souvenir.

Nice day - Len Gurner was trying to make small chips with his pen knife to make a fire for breakfast & he cut the top of his finger clean off. I very fortunately stopped the bleeding almost immediately, he went in to see a doctor later & it started bleeding again, so much so that the artery had to be tied - Have Len on light duties - Very quiet.
