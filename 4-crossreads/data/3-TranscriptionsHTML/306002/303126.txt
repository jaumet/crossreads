<p>30.4.15<br/>Fri. 30th.  Dismounted parade all day &amp; were signalling to B Sqd. had a fairly easy time of it.  I see by tonights paper that there was great rejoicing in Australasia when they heard of the work done at the Dardanelles, these papers publish no news of any consequence.</p>
<p>Tonight at the Y.M.C.A. Col. Merrington said that our casualties was 2,500 &amp; 600 killed.  I put the night in writing.  I believe my name came out in orders tonight as Corporal of C Sqd. signallers.</p>
