  
 I am pleased that you still get the journals from parliament house.   Bother forgot to turn off the red tape.  This an easy typewriter to work? I must buy one like to it some day. 
 The GErmans -  they do not deserve one capital letter much less two to their name - have had no respect for holy shrines or anything else during their progress through Belgium and France, when the reckoning comes these things will be remembered.  Glad that you thought the troops to look better than their predecessors, they are all wanted here very badly at the present moment.  The war is becoming more wonderful each day.   Now that Italy has come in on our side the task for the enemy will be greater for the rest of the struggle. 
 The casualty list from the Dardanelles grows each day.  A man who has just come here to day told me that Harry Clayton was doing work in the firing zone for some days relieving a Captain Tebbutt? he was safe when the soldier left some ten days back.  That is good.   If I gather more information about him I shall write it out for you.  There may be lots of opportunities for me to see fighting yet, I hope to do so before I return, but at present my duties keep me here, where there is plenty for me to do, one batch of patients coming tomorrow number fifty, there will be others of whom I have had no advice.  On Saturday I may send a large number back to Australia on the Kyarra. 
 Mr. Vallon's brother was amongst those who have had bad luck, he has a large number of colleagues not in France alone.  Sir William Manning, and John Wheeler were well known to me.   R.I.P. 
 Glad that you thought that I looked happy in the photo, I tried to put on my best smile that it might please you, the later one I think to be an improvement on the first, but no further copies are to be had of it owing to some difficulty about the plates, further enquiries will be made about it within a day or two. 
 The letter from Shepheards hotel was written while waiting for some one.  Oh yes Jerome looks after me carefully, he becomes anxious if anything goes wrong with me, we are both happy here ? he I fancy was not perfectly secure in his mind with that bounder Martin, no decent man could be.  From all accounts business matters with you must be slack, but all will be right in time.  With the war and the dry weather and so many men away from the country how could they be otherwise.  I always thought that Jack Meyers had an idea that the Meagher speech was a fair effort for an amateur.  If my dear Father had made me a barrister my success had perhaps been greater than it has been yet am I content and if you be made happy I desire no more.
