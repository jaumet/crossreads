24/2/18 Boulogne
Breakfasted with Colonel Duggan about 9 .15 and were waited on 
by French Girls who are not half as nice or attentive as the WAACs. Indeed this club is far below the standard as the one round near the Church. Walked across the bridge and along the Quay where fishing boats laden with their catch were pulling in. the fish were being scooped up from the holds in baskets and packed into boxes with ice. A curious crowd watching. Some tough old salts among these fishermen. Wearing beards and sou? westers they might have stepped out of some picture. Covered with fishscales. Up the street where most of the shops were open and had a haircut.
