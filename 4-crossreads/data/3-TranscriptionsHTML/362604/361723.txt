<p>Dear George,</p>
<p>I haven't enough news to write to all of you this week so I'll answer your letter.  We have had a whole week of rain &amp; dull miserable weather but I went to Salisbury as usual &amp; was lucky enough to have got through each time without a shower at all.  Ellis &amp; Dave have just gone out for a run on the Bike, it having turned out a lovely day.  I had cramps in the Stomach all the way Home last night &amp; it was a bit of a strain riding, but I did the 12&frac12; miles under the Hour on a wet road.  I don't know how you could do 10 3/5 for the 100.  I'll bet Elby your scratch man can't do that unless He is a bit of a marvel.  You'll have to run dead for a good while until</p>
