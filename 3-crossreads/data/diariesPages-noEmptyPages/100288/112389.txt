our faces with handkerchiefs as we were unable to stand sand beating against us. Wind dropped late in the day. Very glad to get our tent pitched a biscuit to eat at 4.30 pm. Turned in about 9 pm.

Arose 7 AM. Camp now 11 miles from canal, situated between Bitter Lakes TIMSAH Lake. One loaf between 12 of us for dinner, rather short rations. Commenced another dugout during afternoon, to act as a dressing station. Shower of rain at night, rather unusual
