<p>12th July Wednesday 1916 Romani.</p>
<p>Another "stunt" the troops are going out at 3.30 pm and for once I am not going. My finger is in bandages and up to now the thorn has not been removed perhaps it means an operation If thats so I shall also undergo an operation for piles at the same time Very hot during the early morning but later the sea breezes come along Our horses are getting dog poor now and Bones are sticking out everywhere. The men are worked off their feet and are suffering principally from loss of sleep. We are going from daylight (before daylight in fact.) because our day starts at 3.AM. when we stand to arms and until 8 oclock at night and then about 200 men are<strike>then</strike> for outpost duty and about 20 of them for stable picket. Too solid altogether. The writing is bad but my finger is sore and I cannot hold the pen properly.</p>
