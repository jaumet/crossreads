 Parade 8.&nbsp; Find only three men of our section are on the draft.&nbsp; Rest came a thud, as all my pals, with the exception of two or three, have gone.&nbsp; Feel very down in the mouth at the prospects of being separated from my chums on the other side.&nbsp; Put on fatigues all day at Forresters Hall washing up and cleaning out the place, with its usual once-a-week thoroughness.&nbsp; After tea rang Mrs Linley and then said Au Revoir to the boys who were going away to-night.&nbsp; Had toothache all day and decided to visit Dentist on the morrow.&nbsp; Returned to billet and spent evening, in spite of jawache, reading.&nbsp; Went bed at 9.30 and had very little, if any, sleep all night.

 Parade 8.&nbsp; Church farm till 10.30 when toothache got too bad to stand.&nbsp; Saw Sgt. Hadley and got his permiss-ion and Majoy Gregson&#39;s to go to see the Dentist.&nbsp; Did so and he drew the tooth as being useless.&nbsp; It might have been to him.&nbsp; It had begun to abcess and my face was very sore.&nbsp; I longed for sympathy from somebody, but there was none to be had and, after having a cup of tea at the billet for my lunch, I again set out for the old Church grounds, well guarded against any risk of catching cold in my face.&nbsp; After answering my name at the parade, Sgt Nobes told me to go home.&nbsp; I returned to billet, shaved, washed my mouth out with Peroxide and then crawled into bed and had a sleep.&nbsp; I felt much relieved and better when I awakened.&nbsp; Sat by the fire till tea time.&nbsp; Had tea.&nbsp; Rang up Mrs Linley and returned to billet to spend evening there reading and writing.&nbsp; Feel as well to-night as I did ill this morning.&nbsp; That was d --  crook.
