<p>ground, which bears a cross to a lieutenant &amp; 32 men of the Gordon Highlanders, "<strike>buried</strike> died June 1916 buried July 1917 by the Irish Fusiliers".  Still, even in the areas which have long been supposed to be cleared of the unburied there are still some who have been overlooked.</p>
<p>I was searching for wood in what remains of the trenches <strike>before after</strike> above Irish House &ndash; they are so battered that in places, the hollows are in front or behind the trenches, which are filled up, &amp; the barbed wire is battered down, or covered with upheaved soil &ndash; I dragged some old <strike>remants</strike> remnants of sacking from what I thought might be posts among amongst some wire &amp; found a skeleton, of what by his clothes was a Tommy.  He must have fallen in an attack, against the wire, which he seemed to have grasped.  I hunted up a padre, &amp; told him about it, so that he could arrange for the burial.</p>
<p>One of our men who is going on Blighty leave is taking this to post, with some M.S.S.  I am having trouble with the O.C. of this Company over my writings and have written to the Censor <strike>through</strike> to whom I am going to send my stuff direct for him to Censor.</p>
