Swiftly and dauntlessly
Soaring and climbing
Capably, vauntlessly
Treading the air
Up where the clouds abound
Mound upon snowy mound
Drawing their robes around
Hiding her there.

A Hymn
1
Jehovah, with a lavish hand
Hath made the world so fair
How blind indeed the eye which fails
To find His imprint there.
2
Each flower that on her slender stalk
Uplifts her starry face
Shows in her own sweet loveliness
The wonders of His Grace
3
The dews, the rains the seas, the skies
The humblest life that Creeps
Proclaims His presence in the World
Who slumbers not or sleeps
4
No life ere fails no sparrow falls
Without He knows and cares
