<p>Signals (continued)<br/>And he knows from a hundred signals, the buzzing call of his own.<br/>The breaks and the vibrant stresses &ndash;<br/>The Z and the G and the S's,<br/>That call his hand to the answering key and his mouth to the microphone.</p>
<p>For always the laid guns fret<br/>On the words that his mouth shall utter,<br/>When rifle and maxim stutter,<br/>And the rockets volley to starward from the spurting parapet;<br/>And always his ear must hark<br/>to the voices out of the dark &ndash;<br/>For the whisper over the wire<br/>From the bombed and the battered trenches,<br/>Where the wounded moan on the mire &ndash;<br/>For a sign to waken the thunder<br/>which shatters the night asunder<br/>With the flash of the leaping muzzles and the beat of battery fire.</p>
