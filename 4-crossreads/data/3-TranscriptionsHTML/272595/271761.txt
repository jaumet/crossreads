<p>I said to him hold on a minute but he did not understand what I meant so I let him go, on arrival on the parade ground the RS.M came round for my numbers of course I couldn&#39;t give him any but referred him to the officer in question so over he went but he knew nothing about &amp; seemed very surprised when I told him that he had no more right to march those men off than a private did &amp; if this sort of thing was going to go on they could get some one else to do the job, I was going to have the parade until they were handed over or not at all, however he backed down &amp; said it was a mistake &amp; it wouldn&#39;t occur again that&#39;s the way to hop on to these jokers they wonder where it comes from at times &amp; it does the world of good</p>
