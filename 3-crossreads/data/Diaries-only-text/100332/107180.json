Iron with knots of wood placed here there with twigs sticking out around the top all these knots have holes bored through the centre to see through on the inside of them is oblong shutters 3? x 4, which slide back forward. The entrance is at the back facing the Yser Canal, it is only a small opening where you crawl inside you climb up several steps to the lookouts. The inside is lined with Iron about ? thick, in front of these openings or lookouts are several wooden shelves for the Officer to take notes on. The lookouts all face Pilkien Ridge as I was inside I got a splendid view of the country up to the ridge, I am given to understand this was one of our Artillery Posts used before the Big Push on July 31st 1917. there were another post which was used but had be blown up by one of Fritzs shells. One evening last week I was attached to a Troop Train up at Wieltje awaiting the arrival of Troops from the line we had to wait a couple of hours so I decided to go down the Tunnel, which is on the Canal side of the Ridge, close to Wieltje Cabin, this Tunnel was built mined by our Tunneling Crop right ahead under Fritzs lines was to have been blown up if necessary for our Advance but after our Terrific Bombardment
