 17/1/16 After lunch heard a noise of band playing and so on and a queer procession passed. A native band playing in all discords a thing something like or supposed to be Australia will be there. Followed a gharry with an Australian soldier and some women in it then more natives and then another gharry full of fat native women. I believe it was a marriage, some fool marrying a native. Some have also married French girls, as a rule flossies, who never miss pay day and scooping the soldiers allotment. 
 Settled bill for Dr &amp; self amounting to 1258 piastres of which my share was 500. tips no small item &ndash; even bath was put on bill. Caught train at 1800, dining car and table d'hote very up to date. Reached camp at 2130. new tent up &amp; so to bed. 
 18/1/16 Stayed in off morning parade but at 1100 went field firing with battalion in desert. Passed over pontoon bridge through fields covered with a white deposit like salt brought out by the irrigation. Shooting fair, machine guns firing on our right sending spurts of sand up. Coming back Conways horse lay down and started to roll much to mens amusement. Every time they halted would be cries of "bis!" &ndash; the order of a camel to kneel. In evening unpacked leather box and went through my belongings. 
 19/1/16 A quiet day with a half holiday in the afternoon. Rumoured we leave on Sunday, clothes commencing to arrive now for refitting men. Officers mess in full swing. A good many men A.W.L. and I don't blame them altogether seeing they have earned a rest.
