Sept. 16.On account of the battalion's weakness, "A" and "D" Companies amalgamated, forming four platoons and "B" "C" each formed three platoons. This made in all 10 platoon instead of 16 which we had always had, previous to this. We were at this time well under full half full battalion strength which is considerably weak for a battalion to be. However the grit was still in it and that was the main thing. In this way the battalion was reorganised.Sept 17.On the afternoon of the next day, 17th Sept., rather unexpected news was given to us. That night we were to move up and another attack was to be made the next morning. These attacks were rather frequent but we were advancing and winning, which was something to know.Maps and airial photos of the ground, over which we were to advance, were distributed among the N.C.Os. and showed to the men. An account and instructions of the procedure of the attack were given. After that we all had a good look at the maps photos and we then knew as much of the country as it was possible for us to know. This idea of absolutely conviding in the troops, which was adopted towards the latter end of the War, proved to be a very good thing because every individual soldier knew approximately what to do and where to go without having to always depend on officers or N.C.Os.After having tea that afternoon we st set too and got things ready. Ammunition, bombs, sandbags, etc. were issued out and we put our equipment together.
