<p>1 February, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>I have been off duty for four days now but I feel much better this evening &amp; will be able to go on Parade to morrow alright.  I believe [that?] on Sunday there was a bit of a riot in Cairo amongst the natives &amp; couple of thousand of them paraded in front of the Sultan's Palace &amp; made some sort of disturbance. some Egyptian Cavalry were called out &amp; they charged the mob.  Several were killed &amp; about 16 wounded</p>
<p>This afternoon Harold [Seabrand?] had a fall off his horse while leading three others, - he had a lucky escape, being dragged a few yards by the stirrup, - one of the horses grazed his forehead with its foot.  Last night all the boys stayed in &amp; were in bed before seven oclock.  They were all about knocked up for want of rest with running into Cairo every night.</p>
