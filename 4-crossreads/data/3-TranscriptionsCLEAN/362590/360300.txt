Since writing to you last on 28th December I have received your two letters of the 23rd & 29th November. As I explained in my last letter things now seem to be running fairly smoothly. I cabled my people on the 7th inst that my commission in the Manchesters had been gazetted, & I suppose they told you of same: The gazette notice was on the 28th Dec.
Since the beginning of the year, with the exception of a week's spell on sick leave, I have been here at the School of Instruction learning some of the intricacies of infantry work. The main difficulty was the drill, which is quite different from the mounted work which I have been accustomed to do. I am glad to be able to say that I have job get into any head now - at least sufficiently to pass the oral exams in squad, platoon & company drill.
The week's sick leave was due to a bad throat which started just before I came up here, and, during the first day or two in the relaxing climate of this very low-lying & flat district, developed sufficiently to become a nuisance. I spent the week down at Bournemouth with some relatives, returned to Cambridge on 13th, & have now practically got rid of the thing.
When in London on the 12th I called again at the W.O. & saw the man who "wields the willow" in the Flying Corps: told him that the course here would end about the end of the month & received an assurance from him that I would receive instructions to proceed to a flying school about that time.
