<p>November 1916</p>
<p>14th  (Continued)  prisoners have been taken but a lot of our boys have been killed and wounded.<br/>I saw a lot of wounded men being taken back by the ammunition train this afternoon to the base hospital.<br/>15th   We are still on the drain, but have been unable to get our men from 7th Brigade as they are going into the line tonight.  Yesterday morning another attack was delivered by our boys.  They gained their objective &amp; are holding it, &amp; have captured over 300 prisoners.<br/>To-day has been very cold &amp; foggy with a "bighting" north wind.  A large mail came in to-night &amp; I got 15 letters out of it.</p>
