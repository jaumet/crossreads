<p>Friday 28 April 1916<br/>Passed Wilson's Promentary about nine o'clock.  Nice calm day, a person can't eat enough &amp; it is good tucker too on board here.<br/>Rained slightly in evening.  Very cold at night.</p>
<p>Saturday 29 April 1916<br/>Heavy swell again today;  most of the chaps sea sick, I was only slightly upset once.<br/>Two of us had twenty horses to attend to, and that on a 4000 ton boat too.  It is very calm for the bight but the boat is rolling very much.  Suppose the boys are leaving home for school again tonight.</p>
