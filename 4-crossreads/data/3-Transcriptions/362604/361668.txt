<p>It was my own pleasure playing for that Dance in Salisbury.  It was just great fun to me after being so long away from the Piano.  I have just returned from Bulford Village Church.  It was just a nice little walk down there &amp; back again.  I received a letter from Billy Allison yesterday.  He is still at Fovant on the other side of Salisbury.  He wrote to tell me that Stan Hodge has died of wounds.</p>
