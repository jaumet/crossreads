<p>loves me.  Nobody cares &ndash; so come to my old friends &ndash; don't think I'm down in the dumps &ndash; its only the tremendous heat &ndash; one simply has no energy, honestly we haven't ceased <u>sweating</u> since 3 days out from Australia.<br/>We anchored at Aden at 8am &amp; to my surprise found the scenery very picturesque &ndash; so unlike anything we had yet seen.  The huge brown barron hills without the sign of vegetation &amp; at their base the buildings of various sizes in white red &amp; grey.  I badly wanted to use my camera but in going up found a notice to say &ndash; Snapshots strictly forbidden.  I suppose on account of it being a garrison Town &amp; the war boats about.  A French boat laden with Troops for the Dardanelles was there &amp; we cheered them off at noon &ndash; then at 2pm we were cheered off by other boats.  It was lovely to<strike> hear</strike>see The Allies flags flying from them as we wended our way on.  Some passengers went ashore &amp; motored out to the wells but I was afraid of the heat.  Fancy it only rains at Aden about every 20 years.<br/>It's come at last Two notices up.  The Egyptian Staff &amp; the R.A.M.C. girls to disembark at Suez on Monday.  We will miss them.  So far no news of our fate.</p>
