<p>22-4-19 (Tues)<br/>This morning all officers assembled at HQ &amp; Colonel Farrell outlined a scheme for celebrating Anzac Day. There was to be a dance for Officers with Australian sisters from Abbeville a dance for the men &amp; sports all the afternoon.</p>
<p>After leaving here I have to turn out the Sgt mess in compliance with the Maires request as the old couple 73 &amp; 80 years of age are too old to be put out of the even tenour of their way.</p>
<p>Then Col Heron appears on scene &amp; is taking over on Thursday.</p>
<p>All the afternoon I spend looking for the dentiste but am unsuccessful.</p>
<p>23-4-19 (Wed)<br/>All this morning when I should be interviewing the dentist I am engaged in putting up a big tent on the hill to be used as a dancing place though how successfully I dont know as the floor is very rough &amp; the girls are hard to find so many troops of different units have been merely passing through the village that the inhabitants are beginning to think that it is hardly worth while to fraternise &amp; so the men are not as happy here</p>
