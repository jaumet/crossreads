<p>6.9.15<br/>Mon 6th<br/>Every available man was on another fatigue party last night &amp; orders came through yesterday saying the fatigue parties have to go out every night; we were told we would only be at this post for 3 days when we came but it has lengthened now &amp; we are to remain a fortnight. Stan went to Anzac this morning to have one of his teeth filled &amp; arrived back at dinner time after being told to call back next week as the dentist had no stuff to kill the nerve. We have been trying to get half a case of eggs through Monk one of our Red Cross men but so far have not succeeded. Col. Meredith has been behaving like a gentleman here &amp; we all have a much better opinion of him here than we had in Egypt &amp; everyone agrees he will not be found wanting if we have any more charging to do, he seems to be always smiling &amp; happy &amp; is proud as punch of the old boys.</p>
