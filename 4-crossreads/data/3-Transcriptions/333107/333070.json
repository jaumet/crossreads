<p>Sat Aug 24<br/>Loafed around Camp, did some washing. After Tea Harling and I went to the Picture Show at the Y.M. and the Display by a Team of Gymnasts, both of which were very good.</p>
<p>Sunday 25th<br/>Warned to be ready to leave Camp with a draft. We fell in at 2.15, just too late to get any of the Comfort Fund Cigarettes. Marched to Le Havre Station. On our way in, our party (about 40 strong, B1 and Postal) halted for a spell in a quiet street. A French officer accompanied by a Lady and a little Girl, pulled up near us. The officer got out of the Car and went into a House. Then the little Girl came along, and in a very nice manner shook hands with every man in the Party, including the officer. It was quite a pleasant little episode, and she was a very sweet piccaninny.</p>
<p>We were issued with Rations, and stacked in cattle trucks "36-40 Hommes or 8 cheval". We got aboard the trucks about 5.30, but did not leave Le Havre station till 8. The floor was covered with about an inch of cement, and we were packed like sardines. Whenever anyone moved, the cement flew about and started us all sneezing.</p>
<p>Mon Aug 26<br/>Managed to get a few mins broken sleep last night, but woke up this morning feeling very stiff and sore.</p>
<p>Our train was not an express by any means, and we were quite surprised to reach Amiens about 9.30. Fritz certainly has made a mess of the city and its surroundings but what struck me as very remarkable, he does not appear to have smashed any Bridges. Poor old Amiens, it quite upset me to see it knocked about so badly, as I spent many pleasant hours there.</p>
<p>We reached Corbie about 11, and here we disembarked. The Town is in ruins, ans everywhere we saw signs of the recent</p>
