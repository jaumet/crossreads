It has failed owing to things that need not have been.  Everyone knows to-day that lack of men was the first reason and now it is lack of ----- but perhaps I had better just say someone blundered.I think it was Nelson who said "Five minutes is the difference between victory and defeat" and this Suvla Bay affair has been a fair illustration.  The losses for our Brigade during this fighting have been 1350 up to the present.  Among that number there are some who will have their last resting-place here.  Are we to leave them in their graves a monument to our defeat from this Moslem throng?
