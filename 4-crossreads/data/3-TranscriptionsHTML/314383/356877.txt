<p>May 26<br/>Push off for Kasvin.  This time we have camels for transport.  They give us a beautiful time both in loading up &amp; on the road where loads were continually falling off.  Our march was to be one of 16 miles to some wells, but on arrival were empty which meant we had to push on 6 miles to the next water.  Feeling a bit done up on the metallic Russian Road.</p>
