<p>December Friday 1915<br/>A good many would be thinking of the homeland today &amp; you will be thinking of us &ndash; I did not expect to be in such comfort I can assure you &ndash;<br/>I was amused at <strike>Mother's</strike> label on my papers, "<u>See that these are delivered"</u>, certainly it seemed effective as they were the first I had received. Sun came out for a few hours today &amp; the sea is calm again.<br/>We miss the big shells &amp; Mauser bullets, &amp; the smell of the corpses in No-man's land in front always strongest at dawn &ndash;<br/>But the Chloride of Lime is still with us in the troop decks now mixed with steamer smells.</p>
