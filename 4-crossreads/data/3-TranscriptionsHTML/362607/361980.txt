<p>Dear Dad,<br/>This is the view of the Alter &amp; Bell Tower in a Church very near Salisbury. You note the Bell Ropes. The Bell-ringers stand at each corner &amp; ring out the Chimes. Note the Lovely carving. The high pew on the right too. There are about 8 or 9 all in a row behind that. No one not even the Parson can see if they are occupied or not. I sat in the first one with my Friend but not at Service. The Books of Common Prayer which are in use in this church were printed in 1801. They are old &amp; worn looking with those peculiar brown binding that we have on one of our old Books. The Church is only about 500 years old. Quite a modern affair.  Love Harry</p>
