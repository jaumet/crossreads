<p>sent here &ndash; everything is so full of interest and the drives are beautiful, mostly avenues of huge trees with autumn foliage. The coloring in this country is marvelous. To-morrow is Sunday &amp; I've promised Matron to get up &amp; go to Communion with her so must stop now. I hope you are all well &amp; happy and that things are going smoothly. If Belle has time, I think I would like to know, what my banking account is now, &amp; tell them to write often. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. From, your loving sister, Edith</p>
