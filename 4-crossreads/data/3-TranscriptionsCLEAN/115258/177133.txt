  
 She was looking very tired as she had been on night duty for three months - but is back on the day duty again now. I also met Colin. He has been on leave here too and is staying at this place but is going back in a couple of days. Also saw Jim Ayre; he is staying at Rossmore House and Bill West who is at the Cadet School. I must knock off now. Will hav Christmas at Luxor tomorrow with luck. A Merry Christmas to Mother Hal & Fred & yourself and Miss Anderson and love to all. I am Your loving son Robert C. Wilson
