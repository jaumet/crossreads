 1917 FEBRUARY 
 19 MONDAY 
 Fine &amp; warm but dull. Cleaning 
 harness all day, &amp; I got my 
 lot all clean. We had our 
 blankets taken away &amp; cleaned 
 &amp; brought back. I got a 
 letter from Mother, and a 
 parcel with only one boot in 
 it. The other must have fallen 
 out &amp; got lost. They were 
 rottenly packed anyway. 
 got a parcel from Auntie 
 Florence.
