<p>"Australians"</p>
<p>Written by Miss Ethel Campbell (of Durban) after hearing a wealthy Durban Merchant speak disparagingly of Ausies.</p>
<p>We are not cotton spinners all, but some love England &amp; her honor yet</p>
<p>We stand on the shores of Durban<br/>And watch the transports go<br/>To England from Australia<br/>Hurrying to &amp; fro,<br/>Bearing the men of a Nation<br/>Who are heroes to the core &ndash;<br/>To stand or fall by the Motherland,<br/>And they are sending thousands more.<br/>We've watched the ships returning<br/>With the cripple &amp; the maim<br/>With limbs that trail &amp; falter</p>
