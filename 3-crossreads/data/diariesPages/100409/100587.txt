Bouquet Canyon to Fairmont reservoir, where we stopped 3 or 4 hours on a job. Then went to some cottonwood sandhills 12 miles away and back to Fairmont, then on to Mojave where we are stopping overnight with a Mr and Mrs Walsh. 
Had nice dinner there at 6.30 pm. Had lunch at Fairmont with Mr and Mrs Lowe. Lowe is Canadian born and also when there met an Australian named Florence, from Unley ? Adelaide. At times did 45 miles per hour on the desert, very seldom travelled under 30 miles. Enjoyed trip immensely, feeling real good.
