 Thursday 23rd Nov 15 Heavens!  What Seas - They kept us awake all night.  The Boat would pitch until you thought she could not right herself & then roll back again & all the time your heart would be in your mouth. At mid-day they abated somewhat, but with the close of day the storm is increasing in fury. Imagine waves 40 or 50 ft high & you can picture what it is like.  They seem to rise & strike the ship, which appeared to roll aside just as they are about to strike.  All the Boat is practically sick, with but few exceptions.  It is laughable to see the different expressions on the faces.  All looking very dejected & miserable. So far, apart from feeling a little squarmish, I have kept up to it & am feeling quite proud. We struck the S. Australian Coast at 12.45 pm to day, but have left it again, as we understand the Boat is not going to call at Adelaide.
