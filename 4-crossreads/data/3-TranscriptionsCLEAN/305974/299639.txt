  
 17 Thursday We have been divide since we arrived he one lot going to the 1st division & the other lot going to the 2nd division.  I am in the 2nd division.  The camp seems to be a dusty place. There is every convenience & the food seems to be rather good.  Medical inspection held in the morning.  Rained very hard in the afternoon. Went on swimming parade in the afternoon to the sea about 5 miles away had a good swim no breakers though. 
 18 Friday We don't do any drill here.  Rained during the early hrs in the morning. Fell in 7.45 am to go to what is known as the "bull ring".  It is about 3 miles away.  We went through a course of bomb throwing.  a lecture & practice with the Poisonous gas helmets, a lecture regarding the first field dressings.  We then went through the real gas, also the tear chemical, the latter is a chemical used to prevent you seeing, it also plays up on your eyes, it smells like pineapple, &  is rather nice smelling. 
 19 Saturday After a lot of fooling about we got paid.  I drew 30frs or  1-1-6.  We also received an issue of tobacco, we could either have a 4 oz tin or 4 packs of cigarettes, I gave my cigarettes away.  Went down to the siding & saw some troops go into the line.  Went for a walk in the evening.
