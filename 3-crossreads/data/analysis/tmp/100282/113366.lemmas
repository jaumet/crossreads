 was cold we were wet but you would never think that this would have such an effect . I wo n't tell you what happen at the 300 better left unsaid , the languag was strong , veri , whi the worst shot who ever held a rifl could have beaten us hollow , we were the pick shot of the Coy . " Lord help the worst" , well I laugh laugh till I near cri when each man shoot was signal back to us , the blank look of constern amaz that gradual spread over their face , when they found their score total about 4 or 5 , sometim a "washout" , it seem so imposs ridicul that all these crack shot could get no more than these paltri score I think I enjoy myself as much as I possibl could , the situat was so funni . The weather was about the onli possibl explan , for it was treacher at ani rate I shall never forget this day as long as ever I live , the day when C Coy crack shot went shoot .
