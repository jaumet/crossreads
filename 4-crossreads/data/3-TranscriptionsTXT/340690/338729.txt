12.8.18Fine.  Nothing doing.  Read & general clean up.  Quiet.  Papers and letters.  Passed time and bed at dark.  Scarcity of matches & tobacco & all canteen goods.  Framerville heavily bombarded and also batteries round Vauvillers.

15.8.18Got ready for moving.  Fine & hot.  Dugout built last night and more comfortable.  Counter attacked this morning & badly knocked back.  Leaving at 2.30 & rumours of only out for a few days and going near river to practice pontooning.  Left about 3 after waiting for wagons to take blankets.  No. 2 went alone and marched to Villers Brettonneux.  Very hot & dusty.  Waited there till pontoons found and then loaded up.  Very warm and marched to Dump at Wiencourt at horse lines and had to dig in for night.  Very hot and spent before dark digging in and had a wash, a talk with some Americans and made some tea before going to bed on own.  Some planes over but some way from us and not very exciting.

16.8.18Up at 6 and had to hurry to be ready.  Started about 8.30.  No. 2 going ahead separately to Villers Bretonneux to load pontoons.  Very
