<p>Balloch is on the shores of Loch Lomond.  The trip takes 2&frac12; hours and is right along the <br/>River Clyde all the way.  There are a lot of Ship building yards where among other ships <br/>in building is a light Cruiser to do 45 miles an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/>I got out to Balloch about dinner-time and strolled through Loch Lomond Park and <br/>passed Balloch Castle, an old place in a very good state of repair, and stood on a hill.  <br/>Loch Lomond</p>
