 absurd compliments or you will not believe in them.  Seems to me, you must have had ingrowing rectitude in your staid letter, when you spoke of my letters as being beastly lectures.  Now, you'll please believe I've attemped to make them light, chatty &amp; interesting &ndash; even so far as adding a dash of colour once in a while. 
 But I'm taking the criticism to heart hence this effort. 
 Also there are a few more remarks of yours and questions to be dealt with.  (I find it satisfactory to tabulate these and number them, which makes it easier for you, there is less chance of omission.  Ed.) 
 A.   Personal Items  (1)  Glad you liked Dorothy Field.  I got her letter &ndash; under protest you'd made her write it:  I was pleased to get it &amp; answered 1/1x/16. (2)  Give my love to old John &ndash; wish I'd seen the 300 rams he sold, but will see them next year. (3)  Often see Mel Body (Bundemar):  in London, I mean where he uses rooms at same place. (4)  Your remark "Frank L. is thinner, this 6 o'clock closing is severely censured:  wait till you see how fat I've got on temperance. (5)  Who is Ethel of the Short Hair.  (She sounds alright.)

 My rank in the Army is Lieutenant, where it will stick &ndash; doubly so as promotion is very slow in Regulars for us Tempory Soldiers.
