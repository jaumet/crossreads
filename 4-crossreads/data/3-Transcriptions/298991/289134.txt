<p>Sunday January 14th 1917<br/>We were rather late with breakfast, as we had porridge to make instead of sop. Church service was held in the Y.M.C.A. Tent. I could not go as I had to work. Everything is exceptionally quiet bar for an occasional shell the Germans put over.</p>
<p>Monday January 15th 1917<br/>A very frosty morning. Exceptionally quiet everywhere. I don't believe I have heard a gun go off yet this morning. The chilblains on my toes are aching very much. Fritz put a few shells very close during the night. The Corporal Cook has been transferred to day work &amp; a private put in his place. Very Frosty night.</p>
<p>Tuesday January 16th<br/>Everything frozen this morning. Didn't have much sleep during the day as fellows I met in England came to see me. Very quiet all day. Fritz put over his usual shells. There are a good few patients go through here, also a fair number of sick ones. Started snowing in the early part of the night. Very cold.</p>
<p>Wednesday January 17th<br/>Still snowing it is about eight inches deep now. The sight around here now is absolutely beautiful. There is plenty of snowballing going on, also building of snow men &amp; huge snow balls. There has been a good few battles fought today between the different units that are here. Went to the dentist to have my teeth fixed up (want filling) but as I would be deprived of my daily sleep by waiting too long. I abandoned the idea &amp; went to bed about 11 am. Fritz put some shells very close to my dug out. It was very pretty, watching them burst in the snow.</p>
