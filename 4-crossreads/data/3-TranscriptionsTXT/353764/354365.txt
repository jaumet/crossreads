25.12.15Christmas DayI again obtained leave & made another inspection of Cairo, including Zeetoun, Old Cairo, including Heliopolis Wazro & some more the names of which I forget.The people were dressed fit to kill & were all driving about in their (Garshee's) Carriage & pair.  All lovely Arab Horses.  That is of course the wealthy people.  I had dinner at "Saults" American Marble Bar & then toured round the Drives & Avenues in a Parshee.
The fellows are still pouring in from Gallipoli & are making things hot in Cairo.  They are camping at the Aerodrome Camp Heliopolis where we are.  You should see them, all in rags, with long beards, & practically alive with vermin.They are very downhearted about leaving the place & do not want to go to the front again, but of course they will have to.To-day we heard a bit of bad news, it was to the effect that one of our Companys were ambushed & annihilated.
