Becourt Wood31/1/17 Snow fell again during the night and covered the ground an extra inch deep. Court martialled 6 men on varying charges during the day - some good chaps and some very bad. Awarded stiff sentences in each case. In the huts company commanders gave lectures on attack methods from the interesting book received lately. At lunch time went over and saw General Gellibrand who is just back from hospital and it was good to see him again. Fixed up several matters regarding officers and heard his project regarding the command of the regiment. Had Cull & Cawthorne in to tea and afterwards walked out to an old German trench with strong wire around it. The snow was crisp under foot and movement showed up against it very distinctly. The raiders worked well and swiftly and all the men showed great keenness the stretcher bearers carrying away "dead" and others marching off the "prisoners". Noticed a few faults and criticised them before the men moved in. good fires in huts tonight. Cox, the little runner, had some good furphies. One he had gathered while washing his feet and the other was &aacute;ll round the Tommies cookers"
