<p>Re McCrae, have not yet met but have heard of him he is well. Am glad Jack is with you. Have not seen Nowell lately. Am getting fitter but the weather here is like Brisbane Heat so moist.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]<br/>Thankful you all keeping fit. Dolly's affair not settled yet as to INCOME, but I believe it will be considerable. Also got letters from Kamteen, Walgett, Goolquintle, Frank Lavender, Jack Mathews &amp; others, Mrs. Ferrar. Am feeling a bit fitter but no real energy for anything.</p>
<p>Spend the day up &amp; down the Beach on the top of a tram - where the air is good.</p>
