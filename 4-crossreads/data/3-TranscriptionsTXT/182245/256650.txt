 MAY 1917 
 15 TUESDAY 
 F,ine but very cold in evening 
 We packed up &amp; moved off 
 at 10.30 AM &amp; arrived at our 
 new quarters about midday. The 
 horselines are in the open &amp; I 
 have rigged up a bit of a fly 
 &amp; half a dozen of us camp there. 
 Took ammunition up at night 
 Altogether it is not a bad 
 joint &amp; we have been in 
 a jolly side worse. 
 I saw a lot of the preparations 
 made for the push shortly for 
 Messines &amp; they are marvellous. 
 Every tree hides a gun of some 
 sort &amp; the place is a network 
 of light railways 
 I got a parcel of socks ect from
