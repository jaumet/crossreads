27/1/17.
Stayed in camp preparing for the line; until this evening when we moved up here to supports and took over from the East Kent Regiment. It was a good quiet releif. Had to wear sand bags on our feet to prevent slipping on the frozen ground. Have a neat little "possie" here.
29/1/17.
Having a quiet time here. Absolutely nothing doing this ground is a vast improvement on the mud; it is hard as steel. Stayed under shelter all day for the wind is nippy. Am wearing full winter kit; Woollen Cap and muffler, sheep skin vest; Greatcoat and a blanket wrapped round, my hands in sheepskin mitts. The name of this possie is "Yarra Trench". There was a fair fall of snow this evening.
