Last night some of the Canteen Proprietors had some bad luck. 2 fellows sleeping next to me had some very nice present given to them ??.. This morning it was read out in Div. Orders about the excellent turn out of the 8th F. Amb. The 30th Batt. was also mentioned. Everyone is very much disappointed about having to remain in Egypt. The crowd went for Route march, with packs up S.P. very busy making grease traps and improvements to latrines. 
Thursday 8th 
This morning the "Egyptian Mail" published news of Lord Kitcheners? death, and is of course the chief topic of conversation. I went into Nefiche and had a look round the village. It is a very squalid looking hole and all the natives are very dirty. Everyone of them has something for sale, cigarettes, tinned fruit cocoanuts etc., for which they ask exorbitant prices. There is a guard of West Indian Troops on the bridge and they stopped us from going into the village proper. After lunch we held a meeting to appoint a committee to arrange tings for the Divisonal Sports to be held next Tuesday, so the Lord only knows when we are going to leave Egypt.

Saturday 10th
Brigade Sports. The winners to compete in the Div. Sports next Tuesday. The ground was laid out in first class style and we had the 4th Battalion Bands playing so there was plenty of Music, considering there were 4 thousand men to choose from the winners had to be pretty good. Sgt. Hefferman came 2nd in the High Jump, 5ft which is good, as they had to jump off loose sand, and had no training Wise Mac, gun Section pulled off the 100 yds. Sgt Woodward, Transport B Section came 3rd in 220 "Horry" Playford gained the first prize for the best turned out limber and pair of Horses or mules, so the 8th F. Amb. did pretty well, considering.
