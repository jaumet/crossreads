  
 "swish - swish" of the punkas, created an impression that will last possibly for a lifetime. Wed 3rd : At last ! At last! We are to leave here on Saturday for HOME. The "Matunga" was followed on Monday night by the "Eastern" and the Administration has decided to send the Naval Contingent back in her. We will embark on Friday & everything should be ready for our departure the following day. The duties of the Executive Officer will be legion for a day or two, but think of the ultimate result! Things can happen here in spite of what I wrote a day or two ago. This morning we had quite an exciting hour or two. Word was received at Headquarters that the Benzine Store was on fire. The fire-bell was rung and the men went to their stations. Nothing could be done, however, as the only means of extinction were fire buckets & with 12 or 13 drums of naphtha & about 40 cases of kerosene it would have been madness to attempt it. We satisfied ourselves therefore with standing by the Post Office ready to quench any outbreak at that quarter. The P.O. is the nearest building to the store, which was in realty a large tent. As it happened it was fortunate that it was so, as the sparks from a wooden structure would have been a serious menace to the surrounding buildings.
