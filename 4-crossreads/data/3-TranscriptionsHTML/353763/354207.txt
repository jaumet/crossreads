<p>These straw &ndash; conically pointed huts are of course the typical house of these natives tho well known but it was interesting to see them all the same  -  The huts were neat &amp; clean &amp; the compound quite clean  -  The German curator I expect sees to all that  -  We've had also a peep at his house &ndash; from the exterior &ndash; just at the back was a colony of those handsome but very noisy birds &ndash; the metallic starlings  -  They were nesting &amp; parliament was sitting  -  They were all speakers &amp; all made the utmost use of their privilege of saying a few words to the rest  -  I saw no listeners  -  Their nests are large &amp; crowded together at the end of the branches  -  Now &amp; again the weight is too much &amp; down comes branch nests eggs &amp; young birds  -  A tit bit for snakes carnivores &amp; accipitrines  -</p>
<p>Another thing interested me &ndash; in a bee hive hut open all round   -  <strike>and that</strike>were meteorological instruments &ndash; bulbs &amp; thermometers &ndash; dry &amp; wet  -  A rain guage stood outside in good position  -  Yes there was a good German brain</p>
