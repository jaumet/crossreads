Very easy to get twisted on a dark night- "Senusseis" are mounted on Camels & they make no sound on the Desert with their big soft padded feet. Posted some Postcards in book form yesterday   Recd.- letter Mother & Day December 19- written as we were leaving ANZAC    Many of the lost men From Anzac missed getting their Billies  I am seeing what can be done as many surplus are in Egypt-
