<p>hang on with till Horsferry Rd. opened which was not until 11 or thereabouts.  A bed was out of the question for the funds wouldn't stand it, so to put the time in till breakfast we had a hot bath &amp; I shaved &amp; cleaned my boots.  After these operations we went into the reading room &amp; slept in an easy chair till 8 oclock.  We then spent the remainder of our wealth purchasing our breakfast.  This left us entirely broke &amp; with not a bean in the world.  To kill time until the Pay office opened we went for a stroll up Holborn Way &amp; up there I met Sampson one of our old Coy. officers, we had a good yarn about the Battn. &amp; etc., &amp; then Mac &amp; I struck out for Oxford Street &amp; then down to Victoria &amp; arrived in due course at Horsferry Rd. where we were politely told that we could draw no money.  A pretty situation &amp; one we were not going to accept lying down so Mac &amp; I finds an officer &amp; we put our case before</p>
