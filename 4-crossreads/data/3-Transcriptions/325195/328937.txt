<p>14.9.15<br/>Tues 14th<br/>We are having very dull, cloudy weather at present but the rain seems to be hanging off well &amp; the nights are quite chilly &amp; even a little on the cool side during the day time: We had a pay day to-day, I drew &pound; 2.0.0 &amp; sent &pound;1.0.0 to Edie for goods we want. One of our aeroplanes flew over us at dinner time &amp; headed South at top pace, another aeroplane was visible a long way to the South &amp; it was generally thought to be a German &amp;were in hopes of seeing a duel but they were soon both lost to sight, our aeroplane soon returned  so probably there was nothing doing. Our Dr has a bomb mania &amp; is always experimenting with them, to-day he has been particularly lively, exploded one in the Latrines to kill the flies, &amp; several in the incinerator, it appears to amuse him as much as crackers do schoolkids. Eveyone here considers him a bit mad.</p>
