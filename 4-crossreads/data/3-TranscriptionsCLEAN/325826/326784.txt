  
 4.  There is another delivery about 10 o'clock to-night & I shall leave this open just in case there may be a letter from Rid or Le by it that has been delayed, though even if there is it will be only a tiny scrap I can add for I must post this to-night- the pillar-box is only across the road fortunately.     It is eight o'clock now & there is a huge hot dinner to toy with, isn't it mad.  One night we were given ice-cream for dessert!  By the way Mother dearie, I thought of this this-afternoon.  If you hear of me coming sailing homewards & you want any curtains for my room, please use some of tassely ones that were in that box of linen stuff, I fully intended them to be used, also anything else that there may be of any use.          How is my "blue" corner in the garden Father?  Later.  The last delivery has been made & there is nothing else dear people mine so I will close this & post. Very very much love from Your loving daughter Olive.
