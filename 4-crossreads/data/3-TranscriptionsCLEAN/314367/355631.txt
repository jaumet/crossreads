past me - It was Chinese - Naked as an infant - agile as an eel - he more than held his own, swimming, diving collecting fish from the bottom China was easily among the first & how he loved it - He grinned, he chattered - His whole nature bubbled over - He was the primitive hunter once again - In addition to our mob this shot awoke a native village just on the shore line & down came every male inhabitant - Shouting, gesticulating - yelling - Hand over hand they came to us - Many carried fish spears - Boys galore - All talking at once & collecting the fish - Some bit the fish in the head if he wd not keep still - We got 43 - fine fish that shot & no fish was under 3 lbs - A splendid lot - Then inboard & China was again the philosophical engineer -
