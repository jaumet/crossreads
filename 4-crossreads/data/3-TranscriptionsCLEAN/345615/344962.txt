unloading forage, biscuits barbed wire, firewood & the thousand & one things required by an army - one can't realize that we in hostile territory it is all so peaceful & the whining of some a stray dog out in the hills only seems to emphazise the quietness
Dec 21/15Went to 'bed' last night impressed with the peacefulness of the scene & the first thing my Sergeant said this morning when he awoke was "did you hear the bullets last night"?
They had been "zipping" past the tent & awoke him up but I sleep slept through it & heard nothing - a sniper had evidently got down past
