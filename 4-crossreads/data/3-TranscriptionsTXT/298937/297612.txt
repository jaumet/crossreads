Within a mile of the Cinema is the graveyard where many heroes of that battle of Tel El-Kebir (the site of which is about 3 miles away) which was fought when this place was just desert & oases, by lie buried.There seems to be a great movement of troops.Train after train goes by every evening, with Australians, Tommies, guns, horses & waggons.
