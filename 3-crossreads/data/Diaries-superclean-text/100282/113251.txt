I'll bet all I got that Stevens comes a gutser over Whittle, for ever there was a good soldier, well Jack is he has a DCM. a V.C. they speak for themselves, Whittle is a Tasmanian belongs to the 12th Battn. After this little affair we marched away full marching order, out to the "Bullring", all the day was spent in putting us through gas we were all heartily sick tired of the whole concern by the time we finished which was not until 4.30. in the afternoon.
28th Len I went to the fight last night at the "Dell" as they call it, it is a very nice little place a natural stadium shaped like a saucer. Some of the fights were good, but not up to the Lark Hill standard. This morning we had a kit inspection by the C.O. at 9.30 we marched off nearly 300 all told this practically skins the Camp out for there is scarce a man left.
