  
 Saturday 15 July 1916 A grey morning but a perfect afternoon. After breakfast reported to Brigade Major for gas duties & was at brigade all the morning wading through literature to find out what is required, while the company went for a route march. Not much doing in the afternoon, the O.C. keeping the men together & giving them a talk about the probable developments & what will be expected of them. Lieut. Cullenward went into hospital. A visitor in the person of Pte. Nicol Graham, 3rd Bn. of Chatswood came to see me during the afternoon. Austn. mail received.
