Dear Mrs. Jack,
Things have been in such a dizzy whirl lately that I've lost count of how when I wrote last & what I told you.
Did I tell you that we went to Aerodrome Camp (near Heliopolis) when we first arrived.  We only had a few days there & then moved to Toma near Maadi on the other side of Cairo.  I was one of the advance party which went to get the camp ready.  We left Christmas Eve & had a weary trip & it rained too.  We arrived at Toma late & tired & just turned in as we were.
Christmas Day we spent erecting tents &c. & our dinner consisted of dry biscuit, bully beef & tea.  I thought of you all & wished myself with you.  We got off at 3.30 p.m. & I went in to Cairo, met my brother & had dinner & a long yarn.
