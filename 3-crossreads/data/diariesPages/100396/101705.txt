if I can't get into the force (I am frightened of my teeth could kick myself all round this island for not getting them done up when Once I had the chance) I'll work my passage to the old land and if I fail here again I will have to own myself beaten it will be bad luck. I am quite serious. With the great horrible living picture still in progress, illustrative of how, the best made plans sometimes go sideways. I suppose I ought not to be more than very disappointed if I cant go and join the furious picnic, but I am going to have good try not looking back.
Now I expect there will be some good advice brewing for me in anticipation of my arrival in town I don't want it unless theres money in it. Mr Jim Black issued some good advice to Wallaby shooters who had lots of skins and no money it was of course not meant entirely for us. the advice was to go and look for work. he has never had to work in his life (not really, Jim Black is a fine chap so anybody about here will tell you. he has been what you might call considerate to us. these land holders rather like to see the poor old Wallabys get shot at. this station has been worked short handed ever since we have been here. Chas bumped a chap in Yetman the other day.
