<p>June 7th (Thursday) (12)<br/>Things very quiet, usual light diets continue &amp; more food now we two are on our own. Karl our orderly bought us some Treacle as we do not get an issue of Jam or Honey now. I sleep for an hour after 8 am &amp; again for 2 or 3 hours after lunch, it passes away a lot of our weary time. Filled cheque form in for &pound;5</p>
<p>June 8th<br/>Good sleep. Good meals today potatoes every second day now. Leg dresses today, am feeling splendid &amp; getting fat. Some delicious rhubarb tart tonight from Karl. Mushrooms for dinner.</p>
<p>June 9th<br/>Good sleep. Had my "iron leg" taken off all day today &amp; put on at night, also succeeded in walking 5 yards, but felt very weak &amp; queer. Wound is just about healed. Terrific storm tonight worst Ive experienced.</p>
<p>June 10th (Sunday)<br/>Splendid sleep. Good meal today. Wrote letter to Home &amp; P.cs to Kate &amp; Fanny. Iron splint off again today &amp; I walked with aid of crutches 20 yds. Sister Martha brought us some books to read also a<strike>n</strike> German arithmetic for me.</p>
<p>June 11th<br/>Good sleep. Our supply of treacle that Karl smuggled in for us &ndash; exhausted today. The Hospital issues of marmalade or Honey has ceased for several days now &ndash; Dry bread is greatly relished &ndash; Leg dressed today it is practically healed. Iron leg taken off for good. Leg is very thin. Had some cherries &amp; strawberries today.</p>
<p>June 12th<br/>Slept well. Cold compress on my foot. It has healed up completely leaving a  big scab. Glorious plate of strawberries today also bag of cherries. Poor meals today meatless day. Feeling well, I have a little walk every day, on crutches, but not for long owing to great rush of blood to leg. Am very weak. Will not be able to put my left foot to ground for a long time.</p>
<p>June 13th<br/>Good sleep. Two English officers in next room to us come in of an evening &ndash; have a yarn to us both.</p>
