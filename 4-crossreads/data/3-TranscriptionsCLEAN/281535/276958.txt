14/5/19HavreHot summery day. The men were reissued with clothing etc and in the afternoon went to a Repatriation lecture. I took a book and walked after lunch up a hillside into a wood of beech and oak through which the warm sun filtered in a score of colours. Lay down here and tried to read. To avoid going to sleep returned to camp and came near to sweltering in a small Armstrong hut there. After mess with Elwood I took a walk along the valley passing through several pretty peaceful little villages and walking along quiet pleasant lanes and roads. It was nearly dark when I again reached camp and before turning  in watched the drifting traffic of men returning home from the estaminets and places of revelry.
