<p>noticed a very fine Library &ndash; all the works were in French &ndash; Encyclopedias etc, all badly knocked about. Our Division and Amb are proud of the fact that they were the first to enter Bapaume &amp; La Fransloy. Kept fairly busy &ndash; hardly any sleep for about 50 hours.</p>
<p>Tuesday  20/3/17</p>
<p>Very windy &amp; cold &ndash; snowed a little, also a light rain fell. Dr. Hughes M.O. to the 59th Batt. Killed by shrapnel. He was a great favourite &amp; a real white man. Our Division still out in skirmishing order &ndash; several sharp encounters with patrols of mostly snipers &ndash; a few wounded Fritzs came through. Light Horse &amp; the Indians had isolated engagements with Uhlans. Got official news that the French on our right have made much progress also. Most of the wounded have only bullet wounds.</p>
<p>Wednesday  21/3/17</p>
<p>Raw sort of day &ndash; but fine. Division are out 8 miles from Bapaume at one point, the Boys rushed a village in daylight &amp; got it, fairly large number of wounded coming thro &ndash; but Fritz got particular amusement.</p>
