 x   Friday 18th Oct. 
 Yesterday afternoon the Colonel held a parade at 2 p.m. when he gave the unit (or such of them as were there) a talk upon the Education movement, prefaced by the reading of some notes which I had prepared. Then the chaps filled in forms which I had ready for them, &amp; all was finished. 
 These forms have mostly been collected, &amp; the information tabulated, so that we have a pretty comprehensive idea of the various demands which the men of the unit need filling. We have sorted them all out into professions &amp; trades, &amp; now we are going to commence fresh subjects where instructors can be found, or where simple discussions would help matters at first.
