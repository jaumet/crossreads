<p>Sun Aug 4  Anniversary Day</p>
<p>This is the Fourth Anniversary of the War, and certainly it is the most cheerful one. The War news never looked better. There are Special Services being held in all the Churches. Crowds of visitors came to Town last night and the Beach and prom are simply crowded.</p>
<p>Comm Letter 33 to B.E.</p>
<p>Mon Aug 5<br/>There is a rumour going round the Camp that D17 had been sunk, but there id nothing official. Finished Letter 33 to M.S. and wrote to Arthur.</p>
<p>Went to a dance in "Arcadia". It was a Long Night, from 8 till 12, but we had to "clear out" at 11. There was a jolly nice crowd there, and one couldn't help having a good time.</p>
<p>Tues Aug 6<br/>Oh Lord: What a thud.</p>
<p>All the B2A's had to go on a special Parade this morning. There were about 30 of us and some staff officer picked out 10 of us to go on Postal duty to France. I don't know what B.E. will say about it. They say we are going to Le Havre, but I don't think anyone is sure about it. Col. Astbury has been away on Leave for 4 days, but is expected back tonight. Went into Town for a stroll but came back early.</p>
<p>Wed Aug 7<br/>Fossicked around all day trying to get news about this Postal Job, but no one seems to know anything about it or when we are likely to be going. Met Bill Western in Town, and we went for a stroll along the Beach and saw the fishermen putting out their nets.</p>
