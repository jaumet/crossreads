7-12-1916No rain, terrebly cold.  The usual performance last night.  Shelled just on right of our lines.  Today at diffrent times he shelled our old position, killed two engineers, and a number of horses.  A pair of horses in a small arms wagon bolted.  Think of horses bolting in this mud.  Three more of our horses destroyed, and four more sent to mobile.
