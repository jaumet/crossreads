<p>Saturday 10 May 1919<br/>Met Dad &amp; we wandered around. Got my glasses. Had lunch at <strike>Molarin</strike> Molinari's. Took Janet &amp; Marie to see Bill. He had had a relapse &amp; wasn't looking a bit well. Had tea at the flat &amp; then took them to see  Joy Bells. It is goodo too. Brought Dad Hunter home to supper. Got a taxi to go home &amp; it got a puncture. Waited for him to fix it. Left Dad at Edgeware Rd &amp; walked the rest. Got home at 2 am. Saw Miss Gillard at Marie's place.</p>
<p>Sunday 11  May 1913<br/>Lovely day again. Took blankets out to Marie. Janet had not gone back to the hospital so saw her. Left the flat &amp; got Bill's clothing (washing) &amp; then came straight back to the flat. Pritchard came &amp; brought a pal. Gave his pal a reference. Then had afty tea &amp; wrote a couple of  letters &amp; then rushed out to the hospital to  Janet. Helped Matron count the takings from the Jumble sale. Had supper out there. Got home about 11.30 pm. Quite early for me.</p>
