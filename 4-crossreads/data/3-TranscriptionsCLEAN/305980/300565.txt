  
 touch with the enemy, waiting for the infantry to come up & straighten our line again.  At midnight we returned to Sharieh station & found some fodder for horses, their first feed for 30 hrs.  All we got here was raisins from an enemy bakery, all bread & other eatables had been taken before our arrival.  Saddled up all night standing by. 
 8:  Moved off at 4 a.m. with 1st regt. on reconnaissance duty to Khirbet Barata, where we found water for our horses, their first drink since noon on the 6th.  We had to water whilst under fire; having two men hit & four horses wounded.  Had slight action, without casualties, till our own planes bombed the 3rd regt., wounding eight.  At 4 p.m. we moved to [indecipherable] ; where the yeomanry had made a fine charge, 600 prisoners, 5 howitzers & their water works falling into their hands.  We reached there at dusk & had one killed & 2 wounded by a sniper who was hiding in the trees.  Our boys wanted to bayonet him, but Major Hudson would not allow it.  Stayed for the night.  Got three biscuits & a tin of bully here, the first issue since the 5th & ate it all in one meal.
