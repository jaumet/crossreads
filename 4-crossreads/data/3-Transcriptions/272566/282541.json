<p>Friday 6 April</p>
<p>Slept in a ward last night.  The remainder of the bearers came down by road carrying everything, and arrived here soon after midday.  I have been busy throughout the day in patching up two little brick huts which a few of us intend occupying.  After tea Connell &amp; I strolled into Albert.  This town is gradually being inhabited by civilians again.  Fritz flies over every clear night and drops bombs.  He got 13 staff officers recently.  Met Bill Bailey again in Albert.  The men who remained in camp while we were in the line have arranged a dinner to welcome the bearers back.  This is to take place tomorrow night.  The French people at the farm have been busy killing &amp; dressing a pig for the occasion.</p>
