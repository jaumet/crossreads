<p>morning, returning to London by the first train on that day.  Edie is returning to France next Friday.</p>
<p>I shall be in Paris during Holy week and Easter Sunday.  All my expenses are to be paid &ndash; so it is alright for me.  Trust you and the family are keeping well.  No need to worry about Edie's health.  It has been a wonderful and a fine experience for her.  Worse luck I have to return soon &ndash; leaving here on May 15.  If I were single I would stop here for 3 years.  So Annie has lost her husband!  Means another job for me later on.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to you all &ndash; not forgetting <u>Eddie</u></p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Edmund.</p>
