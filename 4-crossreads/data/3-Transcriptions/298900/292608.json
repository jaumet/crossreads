<p>street for afternoon tea which we sat over yarning for a long time.   At 6.30 P.M. we met M.L. &amp; D.W.A. &amp; went along to "The Rendezvous" for dinner which was first rate.   We then went along to see "Arlette" at The Shaftesbury.   It was about the best of its kind I had seen having good music &amp; plenty of fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Coyne &amp; Winifred Barnes the leaders.   Then tube to Nottinghill Gate, supper at Bustos and taxi back to Hotel.  Nearly repeated my previous mistake of losing one glove, but this time went back &amp; found it, the last time I did this it cost me 10/6 for a new pair.    Ramsay could not book a room at the Hotel, so we slept together in my single bed, some squeeze but we managed.   We had breakfast together next morning.</p>
<p>Wednesday 9th Jan<br/>    Decided to have a quiet evening so arranged a day for that purpose.   Saw Ramsay off first &amp;</p>
