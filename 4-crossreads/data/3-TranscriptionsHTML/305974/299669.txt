<p>30 Thursday<br/>My word the Australian Comfort funds are doing great work here, something to eat, <strike>or</strike> smokes &amp; a cup of coffee are obtainable all hours of the day.  Fritz put over a few big shells about 300 yds from here every day, one of his shells killed a German prisoner yesterday.  As we were working all last night, we hadn't to work today.  Fritz put over a good few shells tonight, there were 2 Tommies killed &amp; 2 wounded also 2 of our horses killed.  Some were very close to our tent.</p>
<p>1 December Friday<br/>It was very foggy all day.  Fritz is still shelling all round us, he done some damage to the artillery about here, both killing &amp; wounding some of the artillery men.  My word it is very cold.  Working on the road all day, we scrape the mud off &amp; put down chalk rock, all seem to buck into the work well, as it is the only means of getting warm.  Posted 8 letters this evening.  Was paid &pound; 2.17.4 being a double pay.</p>
<p>2 Saturday<br/>There was a very heavy frost this morning.  Detailed for stretcher bearer from here to where the patients are entrained. We had rather a quiet time though, most of the patients were either sick or had trench feet.  Received a Parcel (Xmas) from home &amp; one from Mrs Daisly. pcl from home well got up. not so cold tonight.</p>
<p>3 Sunday<br/>As we were working last night we now have today off.  Everything very quiet.</p>
