  
 Saturday 10 May 1919 Met Dad & we wandered around. Got my glasses. Had lunch at  Molarin  Molinari's. Took Janet & Marie to see Bill. He had had a relapse & wasn't looking a bit well. Had tea at the flat & then took them to see  Joy Bells. It is goodo too. Brought Dad Hunter home to supper. Got a taxi to go home & it got a puncture. Waited for him to fix it. Left Dad at Edgeware Rd & walked the rest. Got home at 2 am. Saw Miss Gillard at Marie's place. 
 Sunday 11  May 1913 Lovely day again. Took blankets out to Marie. Janet had not gone back to the hospital so saw her. Left the flat & got Bill's clothing (washing) & then came straight back to the flat. Pritchard came & brought a pal. Gave his pal a reference. Then had afty tea & wrote a couple of  letters & then rushed out to the hospital to  Janet. Helped Matron count the takings from the Jumble sale. Had supper out there. Got home about 11.30 pm. Quite early for me.
