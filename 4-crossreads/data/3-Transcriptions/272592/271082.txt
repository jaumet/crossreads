<p>There is a rumour going round this morning to the effect that all those who took part in the Landing Lone Pine &amp; Evacuation are to have a distinctive mark on their colors some say the letter A. let into the colours both Len &amp; I would be among the few to be honored.</p>
<p>Our artillery has been going hammer &amp; tongs most of the day tearing it into old Fritz's trenches &amp; positions</p>
