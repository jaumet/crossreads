Dear Mrs. Babs John Robertson
I am clean once more, shower, clean of tooth & limb, with a feeling of repletion & chock full of bonhommie & kindliness towards my fellow man, the day is warm the sun reminding me of an Australian spring day, mellow in its warmth, recussitating in its effect on all men especially the Australians who in spirits have jumped almost to par from a very low ebb, if we could only get a little more sunshine & less rain how happy we all should be, but tomorrow I have no doubt will be again bleak & grey, rain & depressing - still we take what the Gods give us & try to be thankful.
This is really an extra special edition, really if I write so often you will begin to think yourself rushed & close up into your shell par consequence, n'est ce pas? but this is our Christmas mail & I want in this note to send you all sorts of good wishes for Xmas & the New Year, with plenteous seasons
