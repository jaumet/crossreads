29 August 1918 ThursdayTell Kathleen I have not forgotten her Beads but could not get any last time in Cairo.Went to our Dental Corps & had a tooth filled.  Heat, flies, dust, helped no doubt to make it more unpleasant but it is a godsend in the Field.  Coming out a fusilade was opened by some INDIANS, I began to get the "wind up but discovered they were firing at a goat that had got away on the Hills.
