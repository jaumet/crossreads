<p>Nov  16</p>
<p>Mon 16th<br/>Had three or four brats of various descriptions along side to-day, &amp; Lieu. Butter from the Clan MacCorquodale came on board I believe he is going the rest of the journey with us, he told us that one of the Clan's crew went mad on the journey &amp; one of the lads had the misfortune to have a leg broke &amp; another broke his toe, all the rest are quite well, they have lost 13 horses up to date, we have lost 11 one died here yesterday.<br/>There is no doubt this is a lovely picture with all the New Zealand ships in at the wharves &amp; a couple of warships amongst them, &amp; the colors of the buildings &amp; the green trees surrounding them seem to harmonize perfectly<br/>(On the bridge from 4 till 6 P.M.)  I have been expecting some letters here but have not got any word of mail so far</p>
