<p>Friday 14 February 1919<br/>Rafa<br/>41 today &amp; feel every year of it &ndash; but I've not altogether wasted my life.<br/>Cold better but so many men being in one Camp, not too healthy.<br/>Nothing new re sailing &ndash; may go end of this month.  Dolly will not be <u>with me</u>, but another boat.  Sorry but can't be helped.  Love to all, your son.</p>
