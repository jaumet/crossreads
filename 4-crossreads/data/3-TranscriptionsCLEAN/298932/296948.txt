All night long I have been listening to the fierce bombardment Tuesday 4 A glorious day with a lull on the battle front not a sound to be heard, excepting a tune "Dixie", from the band Wednesday 5 Basking in the sun with a stook of hay for a pillow, my thoughts are good and my mind content Thursday 6 They are fighting like hell, the big guns are roaring unceasingly "Ah" it is cruel.
