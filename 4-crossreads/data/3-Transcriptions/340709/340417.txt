<p>last night with the remainder of the Madang Garrison. I went aboard this morning &amp; had a chat all round. The men of the Naval Guard, Alexis, went to Sydney per the "Eastern". I am sorry they have gone; after having been with them for so long I would have liked to return with them. It is likely that the "Sian" party will leave today by the "Maninda" while I remain to take up garrison work for a month or so, then home.<br/>Closing diary to catch mail.</p>
