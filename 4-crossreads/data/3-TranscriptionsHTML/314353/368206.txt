<p>October 19<br/>like this".</p>
<p>Now John, do be faithful to us, why are you keeping back such a lot &ndash; tell us what you had told to Doug, that 'he quietly left the table &ndash; and remained away a quarter of an hour &ndash; in his office, quite alone'.  And, you 'were alone with him for some time before lunch', and you tell us 'we understand each other'.</p>
<p>JOHN!  DID HE TELL YOU?<br/>Why must you "<u>not</u> tell us", "the date at which, and the circumstances in which, in the opinion of Sir Douglas Haig, the war will end" &ndash; and did he really pass around the vegetables just like any footman or waiter:"?  How sweet of him!....  What a day you had John, lunching at Headquarters, and a day in the Trenches.</p>
<p>"Ah! but it was worth while" you say, "to have seen the boys fighting:  to have sat with them, and shared their steak and chips in the dug-outs".</p>
<p>And the nasty Allemande sniped at you&hellip;</p>
<p>"Then, after we had left the trenches and were crossing some open ground, we got a signalled message to the effect that an observation baloon of the enemy had spotted us, and we were directed to separate and lie down.  But, except for one abortive shell &ndash; which dropped very wide of us &ndash; nothing happened, and we continued our journey until we got into some natural cover.</p>
<p>But dear John, let me whisper it from the light point of the tip of my pen, is this true, 'The war is won', is it?  John, who told you?</p>
<p>71.<br/>A rainy cold dull day&hellip; and a heavy bombardment this morning and now.. the Boche has hardly counterattacked.. No word of its effects yet here.</p>
<p>72.  October 20<br/>This morning early a long and terrible bombardment.. shells going over us to Poperinghe&hellip; and a raid somewhere near Pop. that dropped bombs of some terrible size.</p>
<p>The morning fatigue again to horse lines, and an early finish.  Then with Ridge to Y.M.C.A. Hut, a letter written to Bet, dated yesterday, &amp; tea and biscuits.  Back to huts, the section had been paid..Dinner&hellip;  Paid then with the Transport:  drew 40 F. &ndash; which will make me overdrawn at the end of the month, and posted to T.B.C. 30 F. &ndash; and reminded them of "Certain Noh Plays of Japan".</p>
