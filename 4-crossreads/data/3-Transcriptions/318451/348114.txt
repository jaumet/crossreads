<p>couple of weeks &amp; consequently the trees are all out in leaf &amp; flowers blooming beautifully.</p>
<p>Thursday &amp; Friday<br/>Nothing much of importance.</p>
<p>Saturday 12<br/>There has been a fair amount of aerial activity today though the visibility is not very good.  We brought down a German plane this morning.</p>
<p>Sunday 13<br/>My service this morning was not a great success (7-12).  I had another service with the Engineers this evening at six oclock &amp; though small it was a very nice service.<br/>This week I have not kept a daily diary but there has been little of special interest.  Twice in succession the Bosh raided the 34th &amp; both times was unsuccessful.  There were several casualties in the 34th but very slight on the whole.  There has been the usual artillery duels.  On Saturday</p>
