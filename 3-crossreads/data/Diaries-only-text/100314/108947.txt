18/3/18 Red Lodge
About the warmest and mostly sultry day we have had this season so far. Visited the Military Cemetery close here and saw the graves of the men and officer (Robbins) killed during the last tour of duty. With Dooley walked down to the Catacombs and then went up on top of the Hill 63 from which is a splendid view. There was a good deal of smoke about which prevented Lille being seen. After lunch went down to Bde H.Q. and had a yarn with the B M S.C. Then met Brazenor James ? the latter is one of the very best and I like him very much. Put Cpl Blatchford in charge of our Battalion Paper. All the machinery is now lying at the Transport Lines. A very close evening. The enemy putting over some high bursting shrapnel high bursting and doing no damage.
