The Little flower that was in your letter, I got just after Easter Monday in a ruined garden. there were a few violets there but they would not press. also Daffodils, we did not hunt Fritz out of that village, one of the other lots had that job. a little before we went up to that part, I like your verses that you sent and I am putting them with my collection, I had several rather pretty poems that I culled from home papers, but I managed to lose them, sometime ago. Then I had to start afresh, Some of M. , verses are very pretty, I had some of them, in the book. Sometime when you write would you send me your Lines, "Children of Empire", Bett would copy it out, now I must close as there is no more news. heaps of Love to all, at Ben Eden St. also to Uncle Billy Aunt C. when you see them, also Hilda the Youngsters,
Heaps of Love for Yourself from
Your Loving son Chas.
