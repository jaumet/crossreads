  
 On my return I met men who had been to tennis & to cricket & to that awful form of amusement & waste of time & temper - talking to young women & their mamas  -  I suppose its all right but I cant stand that in a new land with a wealth of natural objects all around me - many of the men loaf up to the Pacific hotel have drinks or aft tea & sit & smoke till its time to return to the ship & they think that jolly & quite enough exercise  -  Well give me the strenuous battler at tennis or cricket - the man who does somewhat & the woman who enthuses & tries to do & always succeeds too in doing things  -  Well - well  -  There's no venomous snakes in Fiji I am told & that shows perhaps why 'ricky ticky' has his attentions so directed to birds  -  Do you remember  our  1st Cup at Flemington  -  I do - well - Chambers was there - as jolly as theyre made  -  Judge Molesworth gave a lunch & we had a ripping day  -  It's a long while ago is it not?
