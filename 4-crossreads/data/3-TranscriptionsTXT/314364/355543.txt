 Thur. Feb.6.  Liver &amp; Bacon for Breakfast. Not Bad at all. Kept busy all day carrying Blankets mattresses etc. to the different decks from the Ship's Store. Everything is brand new. The women came aboard again &amp; continued their scrubbing, so our ship ought to be clean by the time they have finished scrubbing. It poured in rain all day. We had an invitation to look over the "Lion" but were kept so busy all day that we didn't have the chance of doing so.  Plymouth is the home of the Warships. No matter where one looks he can see a warship of some sort, from the tiny submarine classes to the Dreadnought. After Tea I went into Plymouth again with Cpl. Reed &amp; and Gilbert. It poured in rain and we were wet through by the time we reached Town.  We went to a Picture Show for a while, but it wasn't up to much, so we returned Home about 8.30 &amp; went to Bed. Fri. Feb.7. This morning we carried all the cutlery &amp; gear from the Store to the various Decks. It kept us busy till Dinner Time. Thirty nurses came aboard last night. 10 of 'em are for Duty, the remainder are returning Home as passengers. About 1 p.m. the first train Load of Diggers arrived, &amp; we were kept busy showing them to their various Decks. The first train Load came from Sutton Veny. By 4.30 they were all aboard &amp; wandering around the Boat in all directions. We expect to sail at about 10 a.m. tomorrow. Rex, one of the chaps out of my Hut (85) at Littlemore was among the crowd who came from Weymouth. Three unlucky chaps got sent back to their Camp, as we had no record of them on the Boat Papers.
