<p>Suez Canal Zone<br/>1/3/16<br/>Dies irae! Round about early in the morning but coming on very warm did not stay out long. Great engineering and manoeuvring regarding our supersession by Kennedy. With C.O. went across to Hogs Back to meet General Godley. He was too late to get across, so we rode back with the Brigadier &amp; Bde Major. After lunch the Brigade came down (Gellibrand) and talked and after more talk and trouble I find I am to stay here. Dies irae.</p>
<p>2/3/16<br/>Pedler appointed to the pioneer company so I took over command of "C" Coy. A filthy windy day the sand getting in everywhere and stinging the legs and face. The Punchbowl sand hill is a most remarkable formation. On the side from which the prevailing wind comes there is a gradual rise of fine loose sand, the reverse side of hill is an almost sheer descent into a crater fully 100 feet deep. This precipitousness is to be seen on all these sand hills. In the wind this morning the sand was flying off like smoke, the hill having the appearance of a volcano. The work consisted of visual training and judging distance with such of the Coy as were not on outpost. The afternoon was cruel, the sand filling the mens pouches and equipment. It was almost impossible to see more than a hundred yards or two ahead at times.</p>
<p>25 jack tars arrived here at midday and we are accomodating them in our lines, the midshipmen went to BdeHQ. Mackay on his route march found the remains of an old Turkish camp, a relic of last year's invasion. The ground strewn with ammunition boxes &amp; clips and twisted ironwork. We commence musketry tomorrow the outposts being withdrawn for that purpose and all firing to be done from the trenches. Our rifles are being changed for those taking Mark VII ammunition and bayonets also being changed. Divn. H.Q. memo says on account of early departure for Europe we are to get rid of all undesireables. Had afternoon with two A.M.C majors on a tour of inspection. A filthy day.</p>
