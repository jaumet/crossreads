  
 Aerial Torpedo had struck the Building it made a very large hole, as the Two Top Floors had not been wrecked the Torpedo must have come down on a slant forced its way through the 3rd Floor & exploded in the Basement blowing up everything, Icould see the remains of Bent up Beds & clothes mixed up with the Stones & Bricks & the Staircase all twisted up. This Building is not used now as a Hospital & is empty, after a couple of Drinks at the Estam I returned to Camp & turned in.
