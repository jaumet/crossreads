<p>1917 MAY</p>
<p>8 TUESDAY</p>
<p>Raining all morning but cleared</p>
<p>up in afternoon. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>all morning &amp; I went to</p>
<p>Stenwerck for a bath in afternoon</p>
<p>Got another letter from Linda.</p>
<p>There was a battery turn out</p>
<p>at night but I did not have to go.</p>
<p>We heard that Russia had</p>
<p>declared a separate peace</p>
<p>with Germany, which is the</p>
<p>worst piece of news since</p>
<p>the war began. I hope its not</p>
<p>true, &amp; can hardly believe</p>
<p>Russia would be such a cow.</p>
<p>Lord it will mean another</p>
<p>five years war, &amp; the best</p>
<p>part of a man&#39;s life in this</p>
<p>Godforsaken place. Anyway</p>
<p>we have got to win &amp; by</p>
<p>Jove we will.</p>
