<p>Railway station.  When we got into the city some of us went to a buffett for soldiers run by the visiting troops Entertainment Committee and had a good time   We had a fine lunch also bed and a fine concert at night. In the afternoon we took a tram to Camp's Bay from Adderley St. via Sea Point. We loitered there a little while and returned to town via the Kloof Nek,  Kloof Road and Kloof street to our starting point. The tour took over 2 hours in the electric tram, &amp; the natives claim that it is one of the finest rides in the world.</p>
<p>The tram line to the camp winds around the side of the  Mount called 'Lions Head' 2180 ft. and a fine view of the sea is to be had as the tram winds the side of the mount &amp; winds along the side of steep declivities &amp; again descends to near the sea level. The return journey through Kloof Nek circules the mount Lions Head &amp; passes between it &amp; Table Mount up and down steep declivities clothed with trees, prominent among which are the Silver leaves, which are protected &amp; thense to the city. We were shown through the city electric light works, which contain some of the latest machinery, including mechanically stoked boilers.</p>
