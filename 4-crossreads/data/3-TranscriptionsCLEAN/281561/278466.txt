The town was giving a welcome to the boys at Mitchell Park this afternoon; I did not go but "clicked" with a party called Norwoods, and we went motoring along the Maritzburg Road. Spent the evening at their home. A very pleasant evening. Returned to camp. 25/4/18. Spent another day in town yesterday it was good Oh! Reveille at 5.A.M. this morning; got fixed up and went on the train, and was down at the wharf at 9.A.M. Embarked on the Ex-German East African Liner; "Field Marschal", and at midday we went out into the stream. This ship was sunk by the Huns to block the channel of the Fugi River somewhere in East Africa; but was raised by the British and refitted here.
