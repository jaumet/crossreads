22 August 1918 ThursdayPut 80 men into trenches again where Germans attacked us last & moved Camp up the Wadi.  Dust worse than ever, but certainly cooler.We are staffing the B.W.I.   I don't suppose you know who they are but cannot write it plainer.  Posted notes yesterday hope they arrive & ate your PLUM PUDDING on arriving into our new Bivouac area-  I have now done 4 years of war = 2 years S.A. makes 6 years active service.  I suppose the world will owe us at least a living if we come out & are willing to work.
