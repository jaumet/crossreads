<p>Saturday 17th<br/>A very quiet night quite cold. Have given our packs in to be stored. It does not lighten my load much as I find I need my bed shet Greatcoat &amp; waterproof to keep any way warm most nights. Was put on makeing a bank around our horse lines to save them from bomb splinters. Every thing must live below ground level or have a bank around it here. Salvaged some iron &amp; made our humpie much warmer &amp; more rain proof</p>
