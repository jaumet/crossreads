<p>On board the R.M.S. "Orontes"<br/>9th July</p>
<p>My dear Ferguson</p>
<p>Thanks for yr. v. kind letter.  It gave me great pleasure &ndash; for I look on you as one of the really inner circle of friends of my heart.</p>
<p>If I get off now, or go to Egypt later I'll hunt up yr. boy as a matter of course.  Unless Evil befall the [indecipherable] now I'll [indecipherable] and go on straight to England.  The ship is a good one but 111 nurses and 26 Doctors are perils beyond those of the sea [?].  Most of us a v seasick &ndash; (a S.W. gale and a head sea).  All good wishes.</p>
<p>Yrs. v sincerely<br/>R.S.S. [R Scot Skirving]<br/>I also am ready to feed the fishes - [indecipherable] have done so &ndash; but not audibly thank goodness.</p>
