Palace on the banks of the ancient River Nile gossip says was built by one of the Khevides for an English girl who came as a governess to an English family in Cairo.  Later it became a tourist hotel & it was indeed a charming spot for our wounded menfolk to rest in & recover from their wounds.  And it was when the men reached hospital - whether wounded or ill - that our main Red Cross work reached them.  The Military Authorities had their work cut out supplying men food & munitions to the front.  Thus only for the women quietly but thoroughly working working at home, the Drs. & nurses would have found it impossible to  administer to the wants of our men as they did.  For the Red Cross Society & all those working for it supplied not only sheets & blankets & all kinds of bedding, but also tooth brushes & soap, pyjamas & shirts, books, fruit, motor rides, games, foods, lounge suits, slippers, hats, chairs
