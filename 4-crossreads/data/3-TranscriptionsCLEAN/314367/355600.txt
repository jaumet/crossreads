  
 Saturday Dec 12-14  It's Saturday aftn about 2.30 - Forward the deck is covered with sleeping men - lying asleep on the decking - One man alone is reading - He's a cook - Another is using a sewing machine & using it handily - Curious to see such a home loving machine just below a 12 pounder & alongside a Maxim - We are all anxious to hear about the last fight of the Scharnhorst & Gneisenau & who took part in it & we keep the wireless man on duty with his ear pads on to catch the aerial messages - Probably we shant get anything - Our last two messages were between Brisbane & Noumea & in French - The word 'coule' bothered us but it means sunk - "Un exadre Anglais coule Scharnhorst - Gneisu Dresden aux les isles  Falkland et pourinet Leipzig et Nurnberg". That was our text - It's a lovely day - No prayers, no quarters - We  holy stone - the decks instead & then wash down - Clean up for inspection & prayers on Sunday. Most of the officers are asleep - I've lent 'Bernhardi' to one & marked the naval chapters for him - Gradually I'm understanding the navy & naval things.
