<p>treat me too well.</p>
<p>We have just past the Island of Milos where the Venus of Milo was unearthed, and my great regret is that we do not go ashore at any of these wonderful Islands, bar Lemnos.</p>
<p>Should there be any difficulty in re separation allowance, see High Commissioner's Secretary Box, not half a bad chap &amp; refer him to letter which I wrote him in Paris Jan. 20th page (1) one of this book.  To quote the passage which is important I said, "&pound;1-0-0 per diem:  I suggest that you might arrange that she receives this allottment fortnightly, that is &pound;14-0-0 every two weeks.  This arrangement to come into force on or about 1st March and onwards by fortnightly <u>regular</u> payments.</p>
<p>We should reach Mudros Harbour in Lemnos tomorrow evening where I will post this &amp; also letter written before reaching Crete.</p>
<p>From Lemnos I hope to give you further news.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
