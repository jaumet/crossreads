 The weather has cooled off considerably now, so I am taking to open air treatment of sleeping out on deck, If the weather continues to keep fine I will be nice and comfortable, or if we run into a Storm or it comes on to rain I will get wet, because I am right up on the Forecastle-Deck in the nose of the boat. It is much cooler up on deck than it is down below also the air is much more fresh. 
 The Ship is getting very light now and has risen 5 ft higher out of the water than when we left Liverpool. 
 At Liverpool the ship was drawing 29 feet of water, now she is only drawing 24feet. This is caused by the large amount of coal and water we have used since we left, The slight sea that is now running is quite enough to make her pitch and roll about a good deal.
