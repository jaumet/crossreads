February, 1915Thursday 18No word from Mr J.A. Campbell so take it he intends to ignore my letter reTestimonial. The verses Mother sent me I am keeping at the end of this book. They are very beautiful & I know them nearly by heart.Did a Division day today & I did first day as Adjutant assistant - I am afraid I shall NOT be very popular, as it means I am promoted over other Lieutenants in the RegimentThe dust is terrible here, just as like a drought stricken country, & when the Column moves off nothing can be seen.
