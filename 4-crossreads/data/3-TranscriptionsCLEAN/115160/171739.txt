 These Divisional Baths are godsends.  You can get a complete change of underclothing there. Hot water is always on tap in sprays. You can't go there any old time, but there are bath parades.  It is amusing to see the thousands of pairs of socks of all sizes, colours, @c, shirts @c hung out to dry. The labour is generally by Belgian or French peasant folk.
