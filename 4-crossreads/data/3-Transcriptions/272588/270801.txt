<p>Thursday 14 November<br/>At Busigny enjoying glorious weather &amp; not much work. A big Aust. mail in to-day.</p>
<p>Friday 15 November<br/>Still at Bussigny. We are liable to move at any time to the Frontier, but I think that we will have to go on foot. We are having glorious weather &amp; the moonlit nights are no longer feared for fear of visits of enemy 'planes. We saw a very fine show to-night, the "Pedlars" &amp; it is the best we have seen in France.</p>
