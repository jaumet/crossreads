 Christmas Dinner at the Chateau d'Rose at Armentieres  While we were out on the 23rd November we celebrated the first anniversary of our arrival in France; we were in hutments, chose a big hut for Officers' Mess, hired a funny old piano from a nearby Estaminet, and had a special dinner and evening and with song and story passed a memorable night into the "Book of Memories." 
    I'm feeling quite fit and as I'm getting more exercise even the rheumatism has left me pretty much alone, and I'm like a giant refreshed or a young lamb skipping for joy or some other silly thing. 
    Our Batmen have just brought in a coke fire in a brazier made from an oil drum, so all the world is bright and gay for we are delightfully warm.  Birdy is writing too, so there are no interruptions.  "Elections" in a couple of days time, or rather the Referenda; of course officially I cannot do anything to influence the voting, but personally I am doing what I can to stem the "No" idea which is I feel, very strong.  I've ordered a copy of the A.I.F.Christmas Book to be sent to you direct from the publisher as soon as it is ready, it will be a fine Christmas Card, please accept with all the Best Wishes for Christmas and the New Year, 
 From 
 Yours Sincerely, 
 HAROLD.
