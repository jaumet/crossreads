 1916   TUESDAY 4   JULY 
 A warm day. I was a mess orderly, Bill Hunter was sick so did not come on with me. The Swiftsure had some life boat practise & lowered a boat in morning & picked it up steaming along. We had a couple of alarms during day. The latest roumer is that we get a couple of destroyers each tomorrow & each go like hell on her own.
