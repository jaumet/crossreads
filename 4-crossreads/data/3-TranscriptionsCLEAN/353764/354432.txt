  
 the Heliopolis building Syndicate.  Fancy one man owning a City, it sounds like a fairy tale, yet such is true & the magnificence of the buildings would take ones breath away. I was going to pay a visit Uncle Charlie to-night but feel too tired to do so. Have heard that 2nd Australian Div has now landed in Syria. 
 27.3.16 Monday Went over to say good bye to Uncle Charlie.  He catches 11 am train to Alexandria & embarks for Marseilles next Sunday.  He is naturally overjoyed at leaving here, but he has need to be, as he has now been here 14 months. One of the Australian Divisions have now landed in France without mishap. It looks as though I am again doomed to disappointment as a W.O. from the Canal has arrived here for our Unit. My officers are fighting the case however & I may win in the long run. 
 28.3.16 Tuesday The heat to-day has been terrific & the Flies & perfect
