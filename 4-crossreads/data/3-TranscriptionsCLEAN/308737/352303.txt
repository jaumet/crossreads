hunting for a decent flat & very tiresome, but you'll be settled down in it, you three, by the time you get this. I hope you are all quite well again, when Nance wrote she had a slight attack of influ & Joan was getting was getting a return of her appendicitis pain. Also glad Sam came to see you Chas & I thought he would come eventually. I'm farther away from Charlie now, so cant see him so often I have'nt seen him for nearly a fortnight. But he's going to send his batman round with something sometimes & also drop in himself & see me if he's got time.
Aunt Lucy has sent he & I parcels. He got his a good time ago but mine has'nt arrived yet. Still this coming mail might bring forth ye booty.Well Mum darling I'll finish & write to Gran & Jane etc, Drop a line again as soon as you can
Au revoiryour loving boyJohnTWO 'EARTS
