Another big lot of wounded admitted today.<br/>Thursday 19th.<br/>Another miserable day this is a great country for quick changes<br/>Friday 20th<br/>My hopes are dashed again   The C men were evacuated to England today &amp; I am still left   The sore part is they are from 14th to 24th Reinfts that went so it does'nt seem fair</p>
