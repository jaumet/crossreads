 friend befor . And so I 'm wait . We spend our time between a littl drill , wander about amongst the pretti Dorset villag , and chat with the great lad from the Somm . The weather tho ? is treacher , and unpleas cold , and we often get caught in shower , mile from home . yesterday four of us went to a villag known as Bere Regi . It was an eye open to us . The field for most of the 4 mile along the charm lane , were laid out like chess board , divid into squar rectangl by briar hedg , and interspers with grassi meadow clump of elm oak . The road was hedg on each side , the briar sickl near form a canopi overhead . It was exquisit . Pretti dainti Dorset I shall rememb you all my life . We cross a littl bridg , under which ran a pure crystal clear stream , with wave water grass and small dart minnow , and turn into the main street of the villag . There was a smithi 's shop with a fine old anvil and a roof which was exquisit in need of repair . Sever heavi wagon wait outsid , their pole and har on the road , their master and dear old hors insid the shop , do their slow old busi . Great slow old hors just as human as their quaint old peasant master . These old chap were actual in smock coat and heavi old clog-lik boot , just a pictur I have often seen on canva , but never hope to see in realiti . The great beast seem to understand perfect the dialect of the men , which I must admit , was more than I could do . Judg by their surpris we were the first Australian that they had seen . The villag contain 50 or 60 small hous which line this road a cross street . There were two small inn , The Squir Alms , and a refresh room for cyclist . All so charm out of date . The ale in the inn was delici too . No wonder the yokel live to such an age amid these peac surround
