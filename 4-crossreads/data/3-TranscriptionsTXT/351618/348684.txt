Boys gathering snow in cups to melt it down for boiling purposes as the supply of water was extremely short & we were on half rations. With the boisterous weather nothing could be landed on the beach. The Turks shelled us to-day and a number of our lads were wounded & killed up on Lone Pine quarter.
Tuesday 30th NovTo-day the sun shone brightly & the scene was lovely. The snow dazzled & sparkled like diamonds under its feet. Of course by now most of it was hard & frozen into icles. It was lovely to get the heatening of the rays of the sun.
