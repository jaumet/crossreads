<p>you to keep for me, two little silk handkerchiefs for Eddy (given by wounded soldiers too). A lucky pig, &amp;  a native dagger, with arabic writing on the blade, for Eddy from Auntie Eddle.<br/>I have a few more things to send, so shall pack them up next, shall write  &amp; let you know what I'm sending.<br/>Had a letter from Fred yesterday saying he had received a cable telling of poor Ray Grist's death. He is coming in to-morrow to take us out to afternoon tea. When we move to another part of the world, I shall cable. Hope you are all friendly with Lucy again.<br/>Fondest love &amp; heaps of kisses.                                                                                                                                                                                         From.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           your loving daughter.
