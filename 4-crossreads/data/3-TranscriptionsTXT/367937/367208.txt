Ras-el-tin1st JulyMy dear MotherHave just heard that there is an Australian mail going in a few minutes.  I sent you a registered parcel yesterday; when you receive it open it & fumigate it well before touching it.The table cloth is for you, the links for Father and the studs for Aunt Katie & the boys if you think they can be devided.I am afraid that the things are not much but I could not see anything more useful so sent these along.  If the set of studs should not be broken give them to one boy & I'll send the others something else later on.I have 24 views of lovely Alexandria; will send them next mail: will send the films to the boys.  Hope you got the other photos I sent.Am having a jolly good time here.  Will write to you next week.  Hope you get the parcel & like the things.  There is nothing to pay on it - it goes duty free.Love to Father & the boys.  Suppose they are home now on holidays.Don't forget to fumigate the parcel.  The cloth is hand worked & guaranteed to wash.Your loving sonRob.
