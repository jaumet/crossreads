<p>We have been warned that the Germans are going to release gas, the wind is favourable.  I hope it doesn't come off.  It is frightful stuff.</p>
<p>Sunday Jan. 28th<br/>I have no service this morning so had a lazy morning.  My parade was at 2 oclock &amp; it was very successful in point of numbers.  I had the greater part of the Batt. present with Communion at the close.  Went to Y.M.C.A. at night.  Just as we were going to the Hall a heavy bombardment started.  We were making a raid &amp; for an hour &amp; a half it was frightful.  I cannot say much about the result of it.  Some of our party met with disaster at the enemy's uncut wire.  There was a fairly heavy death roll &amp; some casualties also.</p>
<p>Monday<br/>Went down to Houplines to Cocoa stall.  It was fairly quiet but later on in the day the Hun put over several shells on</p>
