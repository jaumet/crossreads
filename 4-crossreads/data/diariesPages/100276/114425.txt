our Hqr's the dugouts here are built under the railway line are not much good for they are so crowded I had charge of a party of 18 men to night had to take them to an altogether new position, so the Captain called me in to his dugout showed me the map of the sector, it was a fair way off behind "Zillebeke" up towards the 2nd Bn. the name of the joint was Rudkin House but save the mark there's not 2 bricks left standing.
On the way up I was not quite sure of the way so I called in to the 2nd Bn Hqrs to enquire, I was shown in to where the officers were having their mess, the Colonel told me I was on the right track
