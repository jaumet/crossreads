<p>rumour that Fritz has fallen back on our right, but he is still there on our front.<br/>Sunken Road May 19th 17<br/>Returned to this road last night. Had a very exciting time leaving the house, all afternoon he put large shells all round, we had to keep to the cellars. When leaving we waited until one shell burst then hurried out, we only got about 30 yards when another one came, it was just as well that we hurried, once we left the house behind, it was quiet enough. It is quieter here now than before, since he failed in his attack the other day he withdrew some of his batteries.<br/>Last night I spent over ten hours on the phone in the for-ward road, it was quiet, quite different to the exciting time that I had the last night I spent there. This afternoon our corporal ([indecipherable] Ryal) got wounded, not serious though, one in the head &amp; body, it was from a small shell that landed in our road.<br/>The day the sky has been full of aeroplanes, a couple were brought down.<br/> May 23 Noreuil<br/>We returned to the village last night, I came in earlier than the others, had a very quiet trip in. Since last writing, I spent two days in the cutting, on the phone, 12 hours each</p>
