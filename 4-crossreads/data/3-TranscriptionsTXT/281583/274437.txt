 Imagine our plight! 150 odd lorries to unload up to our knees in mud, &amp; shells exploding all round. Nor was this all, at about 1am in the morning the fog &amp; mist lifted &amp; over came some German planes. They dropped some bombs on us but did no damage until they were driven off by gunfire &amp; a few of our planes, By this time we were just about dropping but sticking to our guns &amp; with a final burst we succeeded in completing our task by 3 am. We then turned in until 8am &amp; after a snack, re commenced our days duties. We finished up by 12 noon &amp; the supply train having come in proceeded to unload it which we finished by 2 pm &amp; then utterly worn out we dropped onto our beds &amp; slept until 6pm. At the present time 7pm one of the fiercest bombardments I have ever heard is in progress &amp; the atmosphere is just reeking with gun powder which makes one sick. 
 Rumours have reached us of the fall of Peronne to the French. Monasti to the Servians &amp; Lemberg to the Russians. I hope these are true.
