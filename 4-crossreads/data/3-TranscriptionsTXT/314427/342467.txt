Thursday Feb.20.1919.   (102)Second day of leave. Belfast.The boat arrived at the warf in Belfast about 6.30. We went over to a free buffet run by the ladies of Ulster and had some breakfast. Then I went to the "Service Club" and stowed my kit there with the intention of having a look around Belfast.The big strike in the shipping yards of Belfast ended today and the men started work this morning. I followed the big stream of workers to Harland and Wolff's yards and as no admittance was available today I went over to Workman's Clark & Co. Ltds yards where the men had started work & I was admitted.I went through the machine shop & where large machines were punching drilling and shearing ships plates. Then through the smith's shops where pipes, & irons were being bent, shaped & fitted for ships. There was an oxygen - aceteyline flash at work welding joints bends & angles on pipes for various sizes. It was very quick & effective.I returned by tram to the service club in Waring St.
