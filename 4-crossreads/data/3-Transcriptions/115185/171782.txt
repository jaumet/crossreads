<p>ever enjoy any trip as they always take you away from those you love or at least some of them.<br/>I long to know where you are settled. I hope at the flat and with Mrs Ed to do the work for you.<br/>As soon as I get to London I shall go to see Grandmother &amp; Jocelyn &amp; Rosamond &ndash; who may meet the ship &ndash; and then to Mr Colville to pay in money. I shall have &amp;pound 14 to pay in which will leave me &amp;pound 6. for the expenses on the voyage at Colombo etc and the tips &ndash; and immediate expenses in train fares etc in London. I get my mess allowance to the good on the ship.<br/>I wish you dear Dad would let me know how I stand with regards to you and what Mr Swifts account is. Then I shall know what to do and how extravagant I may be &ndash;</p>
