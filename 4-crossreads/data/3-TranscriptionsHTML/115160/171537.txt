<p>I suppose as you receive this, you will be pretty near Christmas. &nbsp;Well, this Christmas will have a happier outlook for the peoples of the Allies, if the war is not over indeed by then.</p>
<p>Being away from the rest of the crowd, I have not had any mail whatever since I&#39;ve been on this stunt. Nor at the postal arrangements on this job of the best. &nbsp;So I will close up for the present &amp; will drop a few lines as soon as I can. &nbsp;I hope you are in the best of nick and the warm weather much more pleasant for you. &nbsp;I am well and the fiddle is in good going order. &nbsp;The weather is not too cold but some more rain has made it awfully sloppy again.</p>
<p>Gee there are plenty of souvenirs about here that would be handy to some, but regulations forbid and they are left to the tender mercies of whoever comes along. &nbsp;It&#39;s heartrending to see so much waste of goods, but it&#39;s all in this horrible game of war.</p>
<p>Fondest love, Mither, and to Dad Bess &amp; Lock.</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
<p>James</p>
