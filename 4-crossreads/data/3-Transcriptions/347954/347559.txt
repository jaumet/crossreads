<p>swimming from Watson's Pier, in Anzac Cove were not so fortunate;  as a shell fell among them, killing &amp; maiming some half dozen.  A young medico from Dunaedoo [Dunedoo?] had both his legs blown off &amp; another was similarly placed, only higher up.</p>
<p>Fishing is one of the chief items indulged by the troops.  Owing to snipers getting busy among the beach dawdlers, lines &amp; nets have been discarded &amp; in lieu of them hand grenades are used.  You watch a shoal of fish approach &amp; when they get in fairly close to shore, "whiz" "bang", &amp; when the water gets quiet you swim out &amp; pick up your fish.  Fish-ball, pancake, &amp; rice for breakker is fairly decent, even if a little out of ordinary.</p>
<p>Tis a long time since last I entered in my memoirs &amp; to a sunbaked youth sitting in a square hole month after month even writing becomes distasteful.  It is now 115 days since I landed on this lump of land &amp; about five months since we left civilization behind.  Swimming &amp; bed are the only joys of life we taste &amp; they are at times dangerous owing to heavy guns &amp; the constant danger of gases.  We all have respirators, both mask &amp; hood, so we are well provided</p>
