You could see the exact spot where the hyrogliphic cutters downed tools and a little further on where the artist stopped drawing them. He had been painting them most acuritly in black, for the stone cutters, and where he left off you could still see the rough outlines he had put in red just to give him an<s>d</s> idea where to go. I wonder if they had strikes in those days? I was hoping to see the tomb of Rameses II but our guide said the water had got into it one flood time and the limes stone through which it was cut all fell in, but of course the mummy had been taken out before that and is now up in Cairo museum. I have been up there and called on him since coming back from his country residence and on old Seti I as well. After &quot;finishing&quot; the tombs we climbed over the hill and down into the next valley where lunch awaited us. A lovely view of Egypt (or rather a bit of it) can be obtained from the top of this hill. Just at the foot of it is desert and old ruins here and there, further out are villages, sugar crops and canals, then the Nile with palm trees and the ruins of Luxor and Karnak on its bank <s>more</s>&nbsp;and then green fields which fade out</p>
