bags of potatoes which have been smelling terribly, they done alright out of it judging by the number of mandarins they produced after coming up.
23rd. Passed this morning a group of rough rugged & rocky islands called the 12 Apostles, surf was breaking in great white clouds around their bases the waves lashed to fury by a gale of 60 miles an hour easily   you can scarce stand on deck & spray is being dashed all over the deck   showers baths are to be had for nothing   this don't trouble us for it is a blessing in disguise as it helps to cool us, I am getting sunburnt badly & my legs are like fire,   this is quite a change
Passed another large island on the starboard this afternoon the Island of Perim I think it is, Lloyds bought it so they say & erected a lighthouse to prevent so many wrecks
