<p>to change Engines, at 10.45 we were off again and all hands settled down for some sleep, as we were in the rear coach next to the Break van, at every Station we could hear the Rear Chef calling out the Stations, so we were contented to wait until we arrived at our destination, "Quend" at 12-45, we were soon out and on our way, walking very brisk as it was very cold and windy, we arrived at Camp at 1-15 am and made straight for the Cookhouse and had a Mug of Hot Tea and some Toast, afterwards I obtained my Blankets from a chum in the Signal Cabin and made a Bed up on the floor and was soon down to it, sleeping very sound until 8am when I was up and had Breakfast and handed in my Pass. I then took my Blankets over to my hut and soon was comfortable again. As I was very tired and weary I spent the day laying down and resting. <br/> <strike>Tuesday</strike> Wednesday I worked for 4 hrs Shed Driving.<br/>Thursday 27th As we had a travelling Dentist and his staff</p>
