Thursday March 15thThings are very quiet. Fellows in this unit seem very anxious to transfer to the field, some are even transferring to a fighting unit. Occassionaly you can hear the firing of guns here, mostly they come from the sea.
Friday March 16thThere are a good few permanent Base men employed here, fellows who have been wounded one, two, & three times, & are now unfit for further active service. My half day off. Went down to Boulogne with a cobber here, had quite an enjoyable time.
Saturday March 17thRather a very nice day. The weather has been fairly clear this last few days, although this is supposed to be the month for very windy weather, & rain next month, something to look forward to aye! Was put on shack orderly this morning. There are two appointed each morning, & each sweeps half the hut. I swept my half & the other fellow forgot his, so both of us were to go up before the Colonel this evening, but he (the Colonel) was not in, so it was adjourned till 9 am tomorrow.
Sunday March 18thThere are very good shower baths here, it is splendid to be able to get a bath as often as you like. Still keeping very windy & cold. Went up before a Captain re yesterdays business & of course all we got was a bit of a lecture. Scrubbed out the hut this morning, as everyone gave a hand, we soon had it finished.
