<p>15th of December</p>
<p>Today being Sunday the usual services were held. The old parson dwelt strongly on bad language &amp; a few of the worst words in particular which he urged all to cut out before landing in Australia &amp; he is quite right , there was also a lecture on the Queensland Repatriation scheme I intended to hear this but was so interested in "Nicholas Nickelby" &amp; too comfortably perched up "forrard" on big coils of rope that I totally forgot the whole thing, it has been a beautiful day but a little on the cool side.</p>
<p>This evening a few of our lads went down below to give the engines a go &amp; to such good purpose did they work that in 2 hours the old ship covered 30 miles a record</p>
