<p>yards wide and 350 yards deep is cleaned up, the barrage settles down in a protective box, clear of our flanks and rear and protecting our parties fron counter-attack.&nbsp; Here comes a captured machine-gun, there is a searchlight, the first ever captured, now a few prisoners come from far back. A loud roar as one party explodes a drum of minen-werfer, smaller detonations where doors and dugouts are blown in often entombing those inside, Bosche who refuse our invitation to &quot;Come out.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Bosche surrender, a few put up a plucky fight, but they learn the quality of the Australian bayonet.&nbsp; Enemy material everywhere is destroyed, fires are started here and there and the raiders revel in an orgy of destruction, deter-mined that this sector shall be so utterly wrecked that many months must pass before it can be reorganized and re-equipped.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Hundreds of bombs, scores of rifles, dozens of sniper plates, too heavy to carry away, were hurled over the parapet and splashed into the waterlogged borrow-ditch, lost for ever to the German army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile the barrage continues in its protective fire forming a box at our rear and flanks, it is a sight for admiration, and it is to be remembered; our gunners demon-strated their marvellous efficiency and the raiders were loud in their praise, why one of them said &quot;You could have toasted bread at it, the barrage line was so straight.&quot;&nbsp; Truly a risky experiment, but nevertheless high praise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One small counter-attack is made, it is half-hearted</p>
