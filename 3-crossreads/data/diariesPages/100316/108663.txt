17/5/18 Montigny Doullens
Up and away on horseback before 9 am. It turned out a hot summers day and before evening I had ridden 54 kilometres. Passed through Mollieres and Bois and Villers Bocage. The latter place full of Zouaves? a motley looking crowd but famed as fine fighters. Rode on to Talmas and from there along the fine Route Nationale to Bayeux. At this place there is a fine modern Church in a commanding position. Reached Doullens about noon. The town is prettily placed in a valley and nearly hidden by trees. The bastions and ramparts of the old Citadel are the first sight of the town. Rode down the street and put up my horse. Had a wash and brush up at a miserable Rest House place and then paid 8 francs for a poor dinner and some vin ordinaire. Had as table companion a Canadian doctor who was an interesting talker and told me that their men are splendid (like ours) and very fed up with the English (like ours). Did some shopping in the newspaper shops and everywhere was greeted with smiles. There were not many Australians about mostly Tommies of different units and French people. All the newsagents now stock cheap translations of very risqu French novels and these sell like hot cakes. The town of Doullens in a nice place but really too small to be very good.
