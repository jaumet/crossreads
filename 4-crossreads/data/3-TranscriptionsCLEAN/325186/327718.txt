  
 was beautiful  We passed Malta on Jan 16th about 11 am  On 17th a strong wind rose & the sea turned a bit rough & consequently a few were sea-sick again  We dropped anchor at Port Said about 11am on Sunday 19th Jan  The day was very nice & we soon had plenty of boats alongside  A bit of fun was caused by a few potatoes being thrown at the natives  Two chaps were taken ashore to Hospital in a motor launch  The water barges soon pulled alongside & started to fill up the ship's tanks  About 10.30 pm on Sunday 19th we started through the Canal   We had four natives on board & we had a fair bit of fun
