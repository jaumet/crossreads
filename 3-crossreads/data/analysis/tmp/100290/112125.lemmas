 30 Decemb 1916 Saturday Easi night , few casualti Noth do special . Sunday Dec. 31 The last day of the old year . Go on duti at 8 p.m. We see the old year out new year in in rather pensiv mood . Gather round a smokey brazier . At midnight we drink each other health in Port whack up a coupl of Xmas parcel . Continu duti till morn . No fusilad of shell to welcom in the New Year . Just the usual desultori fire
