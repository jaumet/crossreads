<p>driven out again leaving two dead in the trenches &amp; while returning were badly cut up crossing no mans land.  They got a machine gun &amp; one or two prisoners so they say.  We had 11 killed &amp; 25 wounded some were gassed.  This is the first real daylight attack we have had.  Our artillery they say was good.  McCook &amp; I went down to Houplines at 10 oclock tonight to make cocoa for the men who were working in the trenches &amp; we stayed there till 4 oclock in the morning. The men greatly appreciated a cup of cocoa at that hour.  It was a perishing night.  The ground was frozen hard.  On the way we called at the A. Dressing Station &amp; saw a few wounded.  Mr Carmichael was on the table when we got there.  He was badly knocked about but had no bones broken.  His face was badly scratched &amp; his eyes were very sore.  Evidently he was buried for a while.  They say he stuck to his post splendidly &amp; rumours</p>
