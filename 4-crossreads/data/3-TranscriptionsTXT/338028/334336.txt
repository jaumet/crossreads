At Stand to-arms the picked men paraded before the adjt and he said that he was going to Brigade to find out whether the 6th L.H. were sending any men or not, if they do only three of us will go.
Went before Major Moray to be remanded until to-morrow. R.S.M. doing dirty zealous work as his application was turned down. However we are not frightened of the change but if the old Major gets the wrong view of the case it may effect my commission.
The 2nd Brigade went out on a stint but missed their objective but they killed 4 Turks and took prisoners.
