<p>14 January 1918 Monday.<br/>Much Wine is distilled here &amp; Oranges are cheap &amp; plentiful   The Jews sell us eggs, &amp; Bread &amp; Cake sweetened with honey- Many Vineyards &amp; plantations of Gum Trees &amp; Poplars.  Naval Guns bombarded Turks all last night, the Enemy only destroyed bridges &amp; works of military value &amp; left all their Camp sites in a very sanitary condition, we have captured a lot of Waggons, ammunition &amp; Stores- but wood is still the great difficulty- At night Jackals come from the Judean Hills &amp; make cries like a pack of Dingoes</p>
