France26/6/18My Dear Sis,Have just received your letter of 22nd April. Have had letters from everybody this mail you say Lol is a bit fatter, another says she seems a bit taller a third says if anything she has grown better looking so am I to believe all or none. Heard all about the wedding I think they did the right thing in letting her get married for her people used to worry over her a lot. Of course I am not saying whether there was reason to worry or not but I think I knew Bob as well as any one what I know I know "nuff sed". I have received the four photos you have
