<p>Fine but cold. Out signalling all day &amp; had a lamp parade at night. On the guns for an hour in the afternoon but did nothing. We got our [Yancoos?] out &amp; sent some away. I got a letter from mother &amp; one from Alan with my photos taken in Rotten Row. Heard that [Ooll?] Buckland had been killed in Egypt am sorry as he was a white man &amp; a better mate no man ever had.</p>
