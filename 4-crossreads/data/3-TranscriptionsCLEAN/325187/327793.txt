I am having some quaint experiences in the Bedouin Houses, where we patrol & each place kills a Cock & we eat it almost hot, all with our fingers, & seated on the ground.Our Guide the Marmoor every night says tres fatigue, they are very poor horsemen-The AMP Society would raise my premium if they knew the filthy cups of coffee we are forced to drink for fear of offending the friendlies.
