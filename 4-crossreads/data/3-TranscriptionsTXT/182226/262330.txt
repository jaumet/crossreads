Tried to see the paymaster about getting some extra money & found him a very hard man to see. Had to give it up till next week.
Some of the prices in Malta are worth noting. Shave 1d., 100 good cigarettes 1/-, a decent cigar 1d., Haircut 2d., beer 21/2 pint. It is a big contrast to Egypt. Have felt pretty crook today.
The meal hours are breakfast 7.30, Dinner 12.45, Tea 4 p.m. We have out tea just about the time that people at home are having afternoon tea in their drawing room.
The meal consists of bread & butter & has to last 151/2 hours. Just think of it.
