  
 there are no police round and boats are able to come right along side and talk to us. A police boat came for a few minutes this afternoon and tried to punt boats but the mob booed them off and pelted them with potatoes & they soon left; Yes Loyal McNally is on this boat. I was speaking to him to-day. We are having a great lot of fruit sent to us, which is very nice, we got very good tucker on board though, and they say tucker in Q is worth writing home about. please thank Father for his letter. "Home this week! What Oh!" Love to Father, Hal & Fred. 
 Your loving Son Rob.
