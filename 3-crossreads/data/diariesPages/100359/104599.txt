Peter and Billsy May and I adjourned there and had some refreshment and a good old yarn about things in general. Peter's crowd have been in the trenches "on and off" ever since our big "strafe" so they have a good dose. The 15th got orders to send out all their available bearers last night, so there must be something doing, and no doubt we shall get a call before long.
Monday 28th
Nothing exciting happened last night. This morning some Red X comforts came in. Busy preparing for our concert. Got another letter from Lill. and 5 snaps also one from Aunt Nell. The concert came off at 7 was quite a success. The star item was a sketch got up by Blanton and a party burlesquing our Officers and N.C.O's on Parade. My name was on the programme to sing, but (fortunately for the audience) I was a long way down and it was "Lights out" before I was called on. 
Tuesday 29th
Pouring with rain. I've got a rotten cold and I feel anything but happy. The guns are booking away merrily and must be giving Fritz a rough time. The comforts were issued this morning and we had quite a "blow out" for dinner. Tinned fruit, Pork and Beans etc., Our incinerator is doing good work, it was mentioned in "Blanton's sketch" last night and caused a deal of amusement. Sergt.Van went away today, but left his batman behind. Poor Jemmy stayed home to-night and wrote to Nell, and Aunt Nell and started an Epistle to D.O.L.
Wednesday 30th

Last night was a very restless one caused by the unwelcome attentions of "big Game" Gave my blankets and clothes a good dose of "insecticide which I hope will quieten ?em.
