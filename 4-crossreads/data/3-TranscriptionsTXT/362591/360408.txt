 months away.  With the actual flying I have so far found no very great difficulty.  It is certainly a strain the whole time but one can become accustomed to that  in time  by degrees.  It will probably take me longer than other fellows on account of my absurdly sensitive temperament.  In the meantime if I get a chance of going to France for observation work I shall probably postpone the "piloting" for the present.  I have a great desire to be in France this summer. 
 Am down in London on a couple of days leave.  Today the streets are crowded along a certain route marked out for the procession for the Anzac Day celebrations.  I had quite a job getting across the Strand from Trafalgar Square.  This afternoon W.M. Hughes will address a gathering at His Majesty's Theatre.  All the seats were booked up some days ago.  It will be interesting to hear how the day was marked in the Commonwealth. 
 Spring, tho' deferred, is doing its best to make the country more worth living in.  Today there is sunshine in London and I anticipate a run out to Richmond Park this afternoon.  Hyde Park &amp; Kensington Gardens are becoming more interesting and more appreciated from week to week. 
 I sent out a couple of roughish photographs to Dorothy by last "Suez" mail.  They were taken in a hurry but are not particularly bad.  If you should prefer one of them very much to the other I can let you have another copy. 
 I hope Keith's pathway has at last become more smooth.  He certainly has had a sickening number of schools of instruction. 
 Possibly now that the Australians are in France I may get a chance of seeing Arthur or Caesar or some of the others on leave in London.  I look forward to doing so. 
 With kind regards to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; yourself Yours very sincerely L.O'G. Whitfeld
