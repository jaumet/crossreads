some people even stop smoking or "look out for trains" just to show they are thoroughly conversant with the customs of the Country.  But I digress I was talking of the desert.  Well having had all the romance of the desert killed in its infancy before my eyes, I have started reading up the history of the place and find that several famous men were here some thousands of years before I saw it myself.  I suppose this is really so although one must read the works of these ancient historians with a certain amount of doubt as they are said to have possessed very fervid imaginations.  This of course is also hearsay.Initials.
