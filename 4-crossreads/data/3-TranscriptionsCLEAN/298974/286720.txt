  
 Off Malta 
 26th Sept. 
 Dear Mother 
 We are lying off Malta where we will take on another 180 wounded Australians. Some of the chaps are terribly mutilated. This whole business in the Dardenelles will become more serious every day. We work 24 hours per day now. We are all well. Will arrive in England about Oct 2nd
