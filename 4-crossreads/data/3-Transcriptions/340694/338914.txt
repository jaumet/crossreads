<p>29<br/>We didn't leave until 7 am but it was a beautiful crisp morning &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed the trip. I was the only one beside the driver J Lean so I perched up in the front seat &amp; let the sharp morning air whistle past my ears. The country looked beautiful as we whizzed through. We went to a place called Raincheval passed Talmas Naours etc. Arrived back here about 9-30. We sliced off some meat &amp; had a good breakfast which we cooked ourselves.</p>
<p>This afternoon I rode up to see Eric Clarke &amp; had a cup of coffee with him at an Estaminet near by. The weather continues to hold good. Have been issued with a water-proof cape &amp; short British Warm.</p>
