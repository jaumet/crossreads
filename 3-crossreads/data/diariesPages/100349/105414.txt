3/4/17.
Marched out of Ribemont, 12 miles or so to Montanban Camp. Road very slushy, cold and wet. The signs show that our guns are hard on the heels of the Germans, who are retiring beyond Bapaume.
4/4/17.
Moved on again today across the old front line; at a point known as "Millers Son" on the right of Guedecourt. This ground that was once so active is now a lifeless waste strewn with all manner of the wreckage of war. The mud was very bad and there was snow and sleet all the way. Covered about 10 miles and camped in the ruins of a place that a shattered signboard tells me is called Fremicourt. A good deal of Hun "frightfulness" is noticeable here. poisoned wells, orchards cut down churches blown up, etc.
