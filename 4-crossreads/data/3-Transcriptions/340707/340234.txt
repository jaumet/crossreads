<p>10-9-19<br/>Visit Ministre &amp; after met Mdlle [Marga] &amp; we sit &amp; talk in garden near Palais</p>
<p>About sundown the trees the leaves of which are already beginning to take their autumn tints a wonderful nuance of colour aided by a mist which in reality is only a shadow effect. At each instant the colour seems to change but only in shades. I shall for the future always have deciduous trees in my chateau grounds.</p>
<p>12-9-19<br/>At atelier of Mdlle Brisson with Mdlle Marga &amp; after that to Luxembourg on far side near Rue Guynemer with Chopin monument near. The long lanes never straight in this part of garden <strike>all</strike> overshadowed walks &amp; patches of bright flowers far surpass any garden I have seen &amp; leave a memory of beauty that [indecipherable] will always be present</p>
<p>16-9-19<br/>Fountainbleau &ndash; rise 6.30 &amp; take our dinner provided by Brise a fowl a bottle of wine, fancy biscuits &amp; cake &amp; fruit, not bad for a rural dinner in the forest.</p>
<p>We reach station &amp; instead of going to town &amp; chateau strike off in opposite direction the only ones to do so &amp; as always untrodden paths are pleasantest we find a treasure trove</p>
