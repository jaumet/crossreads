 Tuesday 30 April 1918 H.A.P. with Addie, in air 3 h. 5 m. Patrolled over the L.H. [Light Horse] as they attacked Es Salt.  No Huns came over. Addie was lying in his tent when a B.F. taking off crashes into it, was lucky to escape with his life, goes to hospital with a bust knee cap. 
 Wednesday 1 May 1918 2 B.F.s missing today, no news so far. Went to see Addie in hospital at Ludd. Awfully sorry to loose my pilot for a time as Addie is unbeatable in the air and we know one another so well.
