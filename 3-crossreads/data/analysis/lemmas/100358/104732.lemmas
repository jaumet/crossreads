 yesterday in which a tear gas shell had been explod , just to get us use to the smell sensat . It is essenti that a sentri should not give a gas alarm when it is onli a tear shell , so they teach us the differ with the real good . The trench was a windi one , about 20 yard long , and 7 feet deep , so that we could not just close our eye and run through it . My word it irrit your eye aw . The tear come in bucket full , and you are certain useless , when amongst it . It sting bad and make you cough . I thought I just could n't stand it , it was quit demoralis , and felt as if I would have to leap out of the trench . Of cours this is what Fritz want . You are greet with a rattl from the machin gun . I had to keep open my eye to see my way , and each time I did it , the sting pain was just as much as you could stand . But I got through alright , and there are no after effect at all . I ll bet I know tear gas wherev I meet it . We were also march through an asphyxi gas chamber , fill with the poison Chlorin Phosgen . This is main to test give confid in your gas helmet , which of cours was worn , and veri care adjust . One sniff of this aw stuff is suffici to knock you out , and 2 would kill you . So now we are "fit " . This mean we go up to the line in the cours of the next few day . Our issu will be supplement by a box respir , leather jacket woollen glove , and a shrapnel helmet . Then for it . I have spent sever even down in the town of Etapl , and one even at Paris-plag , a seasid resort near by . Our leav is onli from 4 pm . till 8 pm . so we cant go far . Etapl is a funni jumbl up old place , noth modern about it at all . The street are cobbl narrow . I can see now , how much
