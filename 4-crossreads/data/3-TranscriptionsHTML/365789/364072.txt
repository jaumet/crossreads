<p>2nd April, a squadron of the Gloucestershire Hussars under Lieut.-Colonel Yorke, with a detachment of Bikanir Camel Corps, reconnoitred Bir el Abd, some 15 miles east of Qatia, met with no resistance, and burnt some tents and stores belonging to the enemy.  On the following day, Bir Mageibra, 10 miles south-east of Qatia, was reconnoitred by the Worcestershire Yeomanry.  On the 6th April Brigadier-General E. A. Wiggin, commanding the 5th Mounted Brigade, took command of the Qatia District, and was made responsible direct to the head-quarters of No. 3 Section.</p>
<p>On 9th April, a further reconnaissance of Bir el Abd was undertaken by a squadron of Worcestershire Yeomanry.  This time a strong party of enemy were found in possession of a ridge north-east of Bir el Abd.  A sharp skirmish ensued when the Yeomanry attacked, and the enemy was driven eastwards from his position, but, owing to the heaviness of the sand, it was impossible for our cavalry to keep up the attack, and, after easily fending off an attempt at a flank attack, they withdrew unmolested.  On 12th April, on orders being received for General Horne to proceed to France, Major-General the Hon. H. A. Lawrence took over the command of No. 3 Section.</p>
<p>By the 21st April, the railway towards Qatia had reached a point upon which a serious advance to hold the whole district could be based, as soon as the necessary dispositions could be made.  On the 23rd, however, the enemy attempted to forestall any such advance by making a sudden raid in force upon Qatia.  This operation, though comparatively small forces were engaged, produced the severest fighting yet experienced by the force under my command.</p>
<p>8. On 21st April, the 5th Mounted Brigade were disposed as follows:&ndash; The Worcestershire Yeomanry at Qatia, the Warwickshire Yeomanry, less one squadron, at Hamisah, 3 miles S.S.W. of Qatia, and Brigade Head-quarters and the Gloucestershire Yeomanry at Romani, 6 miles N.W. of Qatia  General Wiggin, commanding the Brigade, had received orders to dispose his Brigade in the Qatia District in such a manner as to protect all railway, topographical and water survey parties, with special attention to the exploitation of the water supply; also to observe the route eastwards towards Bir el Abd, but not to take any serious offensive measures without further orders.  It had also been impressed on General Wiggin by the General Officer Commanding No. 3 Section that, since it would take two days to reinforce him with infantry, he was, in the event of a heavy attack, to manoeuvre back upon Dueidar, 13 miles from Qantara, on the Qatia road, or upon the railhead near El Arais, some 7 miles N.W. of Qatia.  On the evening of the 21st one squadron of Worcestershire Yeomanry moved into bivouac at Oghratina, 7 miles E.N.E. of Qatia, to cover an R.E. party detailed to prepare wells.  On the 22nd another squadron of Worcestershire Yeomanry proceeded to Oghratina, being replaced in Qatia by a squadron of Gloucestershire Yeomanry, pending the arrival of one regiment of the Anzac Mounted Division, which had been ordered up from Salhia so as to reach Qatia on the 24th.  The remainder of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade was marching to arrive at Qantara on the 23rd.</p>
<p>In Qatia the squadron of Gloucestershire Yeomanry was covered by good trenches for some 50 or 60 men, and a number of smaller shelters afforded good covers.  Their horses were picketed close to their camp.</p>
<p>The Officer Commanding the two squadrons of Worcestershire Yeomanry at Oghratina had been told to push on entrenchment as far as possible, and it was General Wiggin's intention that these squadrons, if attacked in force, should retire on Qatia, and thence, if necessary, on Romani, with their left flank covered by the Gloucestershire Yeomanry and their right by the Warwickshire Yeomanry from Hamisah.</p>
