Went out in search of wire this morning in the direction of Hod-el-Enna got more than we could reel up, any amount of loot but couldn't carry it so will go over when next stunt is over got back to find only half an hour to saddle up get out in which I managed to do the 2nd Brigade accompanied us presented a grand sight both Hal I are mentioned in dispatches so now perhaps we have made good. The NZ's entered Oghratina this morning now the Turks are in force at the Abd they received 1700 reinforcements yesterday its rumored that two divisions have come down from El Arish perhaps but I don't think so.
