Then also when Rid left Wal was still here & though unsettled it was still probable he might have been here for months.  But all that has changed and here the weeks are coming and going, slowly certainly, but still mounting up all the same, and as it has turned out it would perhaps have been wisest if I had returned home immediately after the boys went- still one could not tell and everything is uncertain in these days. This morning was the usual time for the regular English mail and I was a bit disappointed that there was nothing from any of the boys.  I expect their mails are being heavily censored or else held back, but perhaps some have gone through to you, I do hope so. I wonder how they have been spending their Easter time all in their different camps, and you too in your Cairnleith Camp?  Mine were quite simple, the afternoons  of S  and evenings till dinner time of Saturday & Sunday & Monday at the Y.M. Soldiers' Cafe, I was thankful to be of real use, for the holidays brought an extra number.  Sunday morning of course, I was at church & it was a nice little service with sacrament afterwards. The Friday was the happiest day perhaps with all my letters and then I spent the whole afternoon from about half past two till 6 o'clock writing to Wal and Rid and just as I had finished Charlie Westbrook came in to say good-bye
