Paris
5/3/17
Into a hot bath by 8 o'c and had again a breakfast of coffee and rolls while dressing. French butter being unsalted, the salt canister forms a necessary part of the breakfast equipment. Had a haircut in the hotel saloon and left some razors to be done up. For about 12 fcs. the barber wanted to sell a very poor strop. The streets were a little wet from the nights rain. Made for the Place de Concord and walked through the Jardin des Tiuleries ? fine open space but the trees being leafless the beauty of it was of a severe kind. Walked right through to the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel which of course is not in the same place as the arch on the Avenue de Champs Elysees. A little further on is a statue to Gambetta with wreaths upon it. 
The Louvre was now looming into sight and it is the grandest place stretching on both sides. Being Monday it was closed but from a workman I understood that it was closed until April owing to the shortage of coal for heating purposes. There is a large courtyard and thoroughfare right through to the Church of St German l?Auxerrois which has very old carved work and statues on its front
