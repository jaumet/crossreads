<p>[Saturday 21 October 1916]</p>
<p>Went to Arnside Cottage &amp; to see Doll's Grandmother an old woman of 80.<br/>You will be glad to hear that Father &amp; Mother are now friends again &amp; Dollys marriage has brought them together.<br/>Laura is at Walsall but comes down to the Boarding House on Tuesday.<br/>Australian Headquarters are in a low part of London down a dirty bye street filled with Costers barrows etc, not an elevating quarter to employ girls in.</p>
