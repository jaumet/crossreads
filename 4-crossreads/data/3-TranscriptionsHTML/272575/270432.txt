<p>France 23.3.17.<br/>Dear Mother<br/>Last week I received another packet of mail from Aus. some letters from yourself and Bett. one from John and also some from M  So far I have not been near the line since I rejoined,   We were up within sound of the guns for awhile but they moved out some distance after friend fritz who it seems has suddenly made up his mind to move to a quieter place or perhaps a stronger.  The latter I fancy is correct anyway he is moving at present we are away back having a rest for how long I dont know.   it's a rest from the guns that's all.   we have same old Parades etc to do and they are growing very stale, but I have been luckier than some for I have missed them for nearly seven months, now I have to start again.   Since rejoining I have met some of my old mates that I never expected to see again and I have also found out that reports that I heard of others were incorrect .   I think that I told you once in</p>
