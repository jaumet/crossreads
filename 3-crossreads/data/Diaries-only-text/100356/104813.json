It's the first time a motor has made an appearance down there the consternation caused was tremendous, he got back just after lunch after having a good ride, my horse is getting along OK again now thanks to my massaging, I fixed my scrap up for tomorrow we ride into Cairo if we have any luck, so I turned in early.
