<p>I suppose.  One shell landed within about 100 yards of where we were standing but did not explode.  It was illustrative however of what might happen at any minute anywhere in this region.</p>
<p>Sunday 6th August<br/>A very quiet day in most respects but plenty of shelling going on.  Saw a couple of German planes over, a rare sight these days.  Went to service in the Y.M.C.A. at night &amp; listened to a very good address.  A. Section bearers relieved C. Section at the trenches.</p>
<p>Monday 7th<br/>Things very quiet.  Had a run to a reinforcement camp in the morning for a sick parade managed a few letters in the afternoon &amp; also received some.</p>
<p>Tuesday 8th<br/>Orderly Sergeant   So had the ordinary camp duties to attend to.  Built a pit for the motors during the afternoon at which I had to work myself in the end so as to have it the way I wanted it.  German planes more venturesome than usual a few coming over but very high up.  At times one cannot distinguish them, only see our shrapnel</p>
