Monday 29 April
We went up to the next post this evening for rations found the place simply pock marked with new shell holes, one direct on the farm house, causing two casualties to our chaps, poor "Comme ca" Clifford killed Crocker wounded.
We have had no carries for the last 24 hours. Suckow too was wounded in Strazeele losing his arm.
Tuesday 30 April
Early this morning Fritz obtained another direct hit on our house but everyone was in bed no one hurt. Otherwise everything has been quiet to-day. We were relieved to-night reported to Caestre, where we were received by a hail of 5.9's from Fritz. Move on again to H.Q. outside Hazebrouck.
