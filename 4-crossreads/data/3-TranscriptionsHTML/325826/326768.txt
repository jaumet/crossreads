<p>2.  My silence in news from Rid was broken sooner than I feared it might be.  I had a letter and sort of general description dated 3rd March, on Saturday last (15th.) &amp; the general one I posted on straight to Melbourne after I had taken a copy.  It probably would not catch last mail &amp; will only go by the same one as this and when they have read it at Box Hill they will post it on to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had had a most wonderful enchanting journey across France and could not speak too highly of the scenery and the welcome of the French people.  They were 54 hours in the train but enjoyed it all most thoroughly.  A piece of the letter had been hacked out by the Censor I suppose he mentioned their destination; however I knew by other means that it was Havre.<br/>Then with gratitude I received a short letter letter this morning dated 5th inst. and from the same place.  He could not give much news but they had packed up ready for another move bound whither they could not take much and he thought that it was the final move for some time.  That is almost a fortnight ago and I wonder where they are now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course everyone assures me that he is not in the danger zone at the Front and that I need not be afraid of anything happening to him, but you know what an anxious heart is at any time &amp; it will suggest things unasked, and of your own anxious wait I get a glimpse when I think of voyaging back for a month without any news, and possibly another fortnight after that.  Still it is a case of hanging onto the no news as good news I suppose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so good to know of Walter being in England, &amp; I think Leo still at Marseilles because I heard this morning<br/>at Headquarters that there is a big base there.</p>
