<p>with a pack up &amp; is too mad-headed to ride;  Stan rode his new mount to-day &amp; is well satisfied with her;  received a letter from "Brooklyn" also one from home this morning; played a game of billiards after tea &amp; found the tent that the tables are in leaked &amp; the four tables were quite wet in patches, apparently the billiard room is a dry weather one, the Frenchmen who run the show must be making a small fortune, as the tables are booked up about 6 oclock for the evening   they charge 1/- per half hour &amp; they only allow one game per night, to give all a show</p>
