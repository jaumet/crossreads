righ.  Wen When we got through or nealy through the canal, we came to our next port of call and that was Port Said, where we stayed for about 2 days out of which we took coal and stores on board.  We were not allowed ashore at this place.  The port itself is a much bigger shipping port than Sydney, at this time it was full of shipping of all sorts, including hospital Ship's which are very pretty when lit up at night.  I did not see much of the town itself, but what I did see, it seemed a fairly big place.  After getting away from Port Said we had to go into the Mediterranean Sea which at that time was swarming with submarines, so we had to wear our life belts every where we went.
