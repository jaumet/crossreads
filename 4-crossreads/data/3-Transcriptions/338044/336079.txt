<p>1915</p>
<p>29 Sept 1915: Last night at Liverpool Camp. The scene is a lasting one. Mothers, relations, wives, &amp;  friends are here in hundreds. Scenes of last farewells can hardly be described. Special guard on the bridge to Prevent the Reinforcements who are leaving to-morrow from going to town  Huge bonfires everywhere. Rioting Prevails. The canteens are sacked and cookhouses destroyed. No sleep for most of the "boys".</p>
<p>At the gate numbers are disappointed because the soldiers are not allowed to the station for a last good-bye.</p>
