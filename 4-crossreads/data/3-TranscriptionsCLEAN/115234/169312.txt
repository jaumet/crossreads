 Am resuming where I left off a couple of days ago  Reported back to the Batt.  The Quack (Doctor) sent for me.  He is a boxing enthus-iast.  I had to give him a full, true & particular history of our fistic doings  The hand which I injured while boxing for the Championship at Desvres is coming against me
