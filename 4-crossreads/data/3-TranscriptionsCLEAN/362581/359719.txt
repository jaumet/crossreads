My dearest Mother,
I have just heard that a mail closes this afternoon, so have a few minutes to scribble a note to you all. I was so delighted at receiving your letter yesterday but it made me very homesick. Anyhow I think it best to wait a while before volunteering for Australia.
I'm very well now   &  feeling very fit - have been on duty a month now. Am very happy in the ward   &  things in general a peaceful. Should just love to have a peep at you all and the garden. Hope you all have A happy Xmas   &  A Prosperous   &  peaceful New Year. From Your loving baby Edith.
