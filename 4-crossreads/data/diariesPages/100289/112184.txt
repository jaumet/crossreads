Slept in an old house on a stone slab floor, very poor night; pulled out at 4.30 Am to move off early, but owing to other arrangements being made failed to move away as expected. Raining very hard, place in an awful state. Each man issued with his own daily ration to cook; prepared quite a good meal ? grilled steak stewed apples, from an orchard close by.
