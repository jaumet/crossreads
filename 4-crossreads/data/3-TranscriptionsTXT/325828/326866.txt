with one blanket under me & the other for a pillow.  I have no trouble about sleeping & generally don't wake till 7 o'clock.  We got into Freemantle on Thursday Morning 18th &#64; 6 a.m.  We tied up out in the stream so as to allow colliers on both sides of vesselAt first we were told we wouldn't be allowed to land but the coal lumpers refused to work unless the men were allowed ashore so that General Leave was given.  We got ashore about 10' oclock & with Keith Drew made straight for the Post Office where I sent you a wire.  Freemantle is a quiet, old fashioned sort of a place, & I am sorry I didn't follow the example of a good many others & take a run up to Perth about 30 minutes in the train.  The trains & trams amused me with very narrow gauge only about 3 ft. 6.Freemantle Railway Station is more like our Darling Harbour Statn.  Trams are driven electrically but all hand-power brakes-no air-brakes.  I took 3 or 4 photos in Freemantle.  Have taken about 20 photos since I left but haven't developed any yet.  We stayed at Freemantle about 16 19 hours, & got away about 1.a.m Friday 19th.Since we left Australia we have struck exceptionally fine & calm weather, at times the water being just like a sheet of blue glass absolutely without a swell even on it.  For 2 days we had it like that & everyone was remarking on it.  The only waves were those made by the ship herself.  We have had several Fire Alarms (5 long blasts on ship's siren) & everyone bustles to their different stations.  We all have our turns at Ward Orderlies, & also as Mess Orderlies so we are kept going
