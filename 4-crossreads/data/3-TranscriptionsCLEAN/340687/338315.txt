  
 January, 1917. Thursday 11 At 8.30 Corp Thompkins told me to take his place at Flers dump. (I was asleep at the time) and should have arr at 9 but arr at 10.10 for which Bolton had to report to Bgde Party of 20 men and carried out to dump near dugouts on trucks as well as unloaded pontoons. Special train at 3 arrived at 4 and took a load up. Infantry very hard to handle. Very strenuous day and finished at 6. Snowing all morning and very cold. Went to bed after reading chronicles but slept badly.
