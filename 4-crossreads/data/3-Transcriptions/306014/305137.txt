<p>the budding trees close to hand and the bare branches of the old firs silhouetted on the horizon, only needed the beautiful little village brook to complete the ideal picture. Such was the scene of our banqueting-house; such were the touches of nature's hand that thrilled us with sober &amp; sombre delight. A "superb intoxication" is what Wilde would call such joys, and the expression seems to be superbly apt.</p>
<p>April 14</p>
<p>The 19th Reinforcements of our Battn. Arrived last night. They are finding the place a bit cool as yet, and are getting about in their overcoats. We don't wear such encumbrances, even at night.</p>
<p>Usual route march this morning. After dinner we again walked to Devizes across the artillery ranges and on the way managed to get a few shell caps. If anyone finds these in our possession we will be liable to prosecution, but that is nothing under the circumstances.</p>
