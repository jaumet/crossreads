<p>C/o D. M. S.<br/>Cairo<br/>Egypt<br/>28 Septbr 1915.</p>
<p>My dear Girls:</p>
<p>A letter was posted to you this morning with my benedictions that it may reach you in good time and bring to you happy thoughts about me. The enclosures too may amuse and instruct.</p>
<p>Two parcels &amp; illustrated papers were addressed to Mollie.</p>
<p>This afternoon there came to me letters from you Joseph dear, two one dated 15.8.15 the other 17-8-15 the former written at Neutral Bay the latter at Macquarie Street, from Mr. Moroney, Dr Patar &amp; MacNamara. How depressed friend Bob appears to be. His written words point that way to me. Are his spoken words indicative of the same condition? Sorry if he is commencing to take a gloomy view of life, such makes the game uncomfortable for oneself and those about him. MacNamara had not received the power of attorney, you must have it long ere this as the package was registered to you.<br/>Word is to hand just now of the sinking of the Runic with much loss of life, we hope that it is not true.<br/>Forgot above to mention a letter from Mrs Rouse, I sent her a set of pictures from Matarieh, on receipt she at once looked up the 2nd chapter of St Matthew, &amp; as a consequence she was able to write a very interesting and intelligent letter in reply. She has ideas of the best, <strike>and</strike> writes and speaks well, her mind is filled with interesting records of Newcastle and New South Wales. Her teachers placed upon the remembering tablets of her young brain impressions of the highest class, they still dominate her thoughts, and always give cause to me for wondering who it was that should be given the credit for the good work. I like the old lady better every time I meet her.</p>
