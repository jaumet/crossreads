6/2/18 Velinghem
the 23rd Battalion yesterday a man was checking the aim of another with an aiming disc and a live round somehow got into the rifle, killing the man with the disc. He was buried with full Military honours this afternoon by Padre Campbell. Rode down to see Col James 24th Bn. at his billet at Lottinghen ? only a short ride and had a long yarn with him there. Also had tea with him and other officers at their billet. James then walked back to Bde H.Q. and we enjoyed a good long yarn about affairs in general. Following on the matters of P.V. Martin's promises to the General yesterday it is interesting to note that he was today in a neighbouring village and has ceased playing the game already. Each battalion has a motor lorry attached to it for leave
