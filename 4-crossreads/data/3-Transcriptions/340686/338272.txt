<p>evening working it was quite pleasant with a fair amount of moon but the usual amount of shells fell. Came home and got some rum and tea before turning in.</p>
<p>31-11-16<br/>Usual regime and got up late and cleaned up as usual and get out at 4-30 via [Waterlot] Farm Delville Wood &ndash; past a broken up tank then a battery on to the job. Cloudy and it rained three times while we were working. Worked hard and got down to 8 ft. Shelling all round pretty severe. Came home about 10-30 and all along the duckwalks shells had fallen with great accuracy and torn it up in many places. Passed Delville and just before</p>
