There was rain today, and we marched through it to Herissart, where we went into billets. It is a fair sized place this with a canteen. We are permitted to write letters so will probably stay here a few days. Our boys seem to be popular with the garrulous old froggie that owns this joint. He showed us with much gesture with a rifle he borrowed; how he killed a Garman in 1870. One of the other fellows rode a colt he said was a bit of a buckjumper; and he was amazed to see the Aussie ride it barebacked. Captain Harris's nerves are still bad, and he does not seem well, so the colonel has sent him to a job in the D.A.C. or something.
