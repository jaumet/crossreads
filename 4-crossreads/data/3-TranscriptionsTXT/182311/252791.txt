 I&#39;m one of the two officers in charge of the Lewis Gun training and we are getting very good resuts for the men are most interested. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; We are talking nowadays of the Christmas mail and in case I don&#39;t get a letter away next week I&#39;ll just wish you a Happy Christmas and Peace and Brightness in the New Year. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; With love, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.
