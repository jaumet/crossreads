July 9256.This afternoon at 4 over to the farmhouse for Coffee, in the Kitchen Madame and her man seated unconscious of all but their own selves:  reading awhile Waugh's book of verse, looking up, the man was dozing to sleep, and the woman, leaning listlessly back in an old wicker chair, her right arm holding her head, and the light from the window behind her throwing her face to the shadow made a sad picture.
But on Friday Beer will arrive from Dunkerque, and Madame will be happy again.
Rain again after a morning of wounderful clearness and colour:  early not a cloud in the skies blue and the sun's shadows sharp and cool.
It is a year today since Father died.
Night.A long walk to La Kreule alone, all the way through the wet fields:  for a while leaving D.H.Q. rain, then a clearing of the skies to pale gleaming satin blue with silver cloud lines.  Mail there, Davidson's "Ballads, & Songs".
Buire?
