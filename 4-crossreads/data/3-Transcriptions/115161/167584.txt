<p>attend Brown&#39;s feet and Brown, Jones&#39;s. The only prevention from this terrible complaint was rubbing to produce circulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We are thoroughly drilled in the use and fixing of the gas mask (box respirator).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Water is laid on in this camp, but of course the pipes are frozen, and we suffer a great deal from the cold. We have &quot;braziers&quot; in the huts (any old tin through which we make holes) so we go out looking for bits of wood, result is that we succeed in creating such smoke inside the huts that we prefer the bitter cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At about noon on the 8th. January &#39;16 we march on to our next camp, with the inevitable load. My heels are very sore, but manage to limp along, boots like boards. I find myself continuously laughing at my own misery. It seems so funny that I, - yes! I - should be going through all this. A few shells fall in our vicinity as we pass through &quot;Pommiers Redout&quot;, some of our big guns are here, also a supply&nbsp;&quot;dump&quot;. We continue on and eventually at dusk arrive at &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>BAZENTINE-les-GRAND</u>.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; All round is desolation and destruction, beyond description. Here one realises for the first time what war &nbsp;means, buildings all levelled to the ground, trees reduced to short stumps, telegraph poles likewise. The whole surrounding earth has the appearance of a rough sea, so &quot;ploughed&quot; up has it become from continual shelling.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The camp is good, the huts large and not stuffy, (no far from it) the places where window have been are now fixed up with hessian, which admits plenty of fresh air. The floors wet and muddy from the continuous ingress and egress of the troops.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We are now only about&nbsp;four&nbsp;miles from the front line. Manage to sleep well, having become accustomed to the continuous noise of the guns.</p>
