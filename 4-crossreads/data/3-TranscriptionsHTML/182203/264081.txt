Sept. 3rd 1916.<br/>My dearest Moth. &amp; Sisters,<br/>To-day is Sunday and the anniversary of our dear Father's death, what a blessing he did not live to see his own loved country in such sorrow. It is really very sad to see this wonderful country shaded in gloom.<br/>The climate is the opposite to the Egyptian &amp; has rained nearly every day since we arrived, although we have managed to get out every day.<br/>Am not settled in a position yet, it is rumoured that the remainder of us (ten) are going to France. I should much prefer to stay here but must do as I'm told.<br/>I'm really feeling very miserable to-day at not hearing from my beloved. Have only heard that he had "Malaria" &amp; in Hosp. in Ypres on July 12th , cannot find out anything else. Poor old chap.</p>
