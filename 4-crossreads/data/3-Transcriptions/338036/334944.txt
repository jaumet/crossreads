<p>Friday 31st<br/>Still raining</p>
<p>September<br/>Saturday 1st<br/>morning &ndash; not raining but cloudy.  9th Brigade Sports today at a village nearby.  Saw tug of war in which the rope was broken.  About midday it began to rain &amp; continued for rest of day.</p>
<p>Sunday 2nd<br/>Signs of clearing.  At night it was clear &amp; signs of aeroplanes could be heard.  Anti aircraft guns could also be distinguished.  Walk to village of Thiembronne in afternoon.</p>
<p>Monday 3rd<br/>Spent all the morning washing waggons for transport and got a wetting.  To day was an excellent clear day with good sun &ndash; the first for over a week.  At night to Thiembronne &amp; met Freddy Clark on return journey.  Am very dissatisfied at treatment by certain L/C in our section &ndash; Witt.  Quite unreasonable to expect men to work under him.  Same applies to other NCOs &amp; also WO.  At night it was excellent clear sky &amp; bright full moon.  Fritz came over bombing &amp; the sound of his engine could be distinctly heard.  Flashes of shrapnel could be seen also.</p>
