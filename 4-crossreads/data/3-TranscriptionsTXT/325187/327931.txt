[Friday 7 July 1916]
My groom went away Sick & he wrote me from Port Said thanking me for sending his Kit Bag, & he said he hoped the Horses were not falling away, he dreamt he was playing with the Cob please tell H.L.A. both going strong also Gunshot. [Following paragraph crossed out]I hope  Charlie wont be like so many other Australians who having made their fortune in their country (& from which many of them continue to draw their income) abandon it for ever, don't talk about it & abandon all affection for the land of their births- We find many such in English regiments- & they always make sure not to be mistaken for Australians, while we would not swap our Felt Hats for all the Helmets-
