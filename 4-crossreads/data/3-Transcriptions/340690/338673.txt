<p>well intrenched and fortified.  Back in time for tea after a visit to 10th canteen and after tea Sidman and I went down to pictures but didn't go in as too much of a crowd.  Bremner told us not to go up on ration cart and to plead that trial didn't come off till afternoon.  After a short stroll and a coffee went to bed.  Bremner gave alarming casualties which were wrong of last night.  Fine.</p>
<p>19.3.18<br/>Got up about 7.30 and after breakfast left our blankets for limber and set out at 9.  Raining during night and very wet and some rain going up.  Arrived about 10 and after dinner had to go on guard at 2.  Usual thing Nelson, Collings and Downey who got badly drunk in evening and mixed with mud.  Had to put Hinds (gas picket) to call the cooks.  Fairly quiet all day &amp; misty.</p>
<p>20.3.18<br/>Stayed late in bed and had to get up at 10 as Colonel expected.  Nothing happened &amp; I read a good deal.  Off at two.  Still wet &amp; miserable but in afternoon slight sunshine.  To go out to-night at 11.45.  Played bridge in evening.  Went out with Clow and Hosking and got a party of 10.  Worked improving two dugouts and vetting in M.G. post.</p>
<p>21.3.18<br/>Fine.  Slept in till about 3 and had breakfast and didn't worry about dinner.  Cleaned up and left at 7 with Clow &amp; Hosking.</p>
