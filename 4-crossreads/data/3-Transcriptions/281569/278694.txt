Things exceptionally quiet today. The Russians seem to be still pushing ahead &amp; gaining more ground &amp; prisoners portion of the Austrian army has been cut off in Flanders, our fellows are doing well &amp; continue to capture prisoners &amp; positions.</p>
<p>30 June, 1916 Friday</p>
<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>The 2nd Bde went out on the stunt today, they are making for Bir-el-Abd &amp; more to the left again the plane has been reporting men &amp; camels there continually for the last few days so the 2nd are going to fix matters.</p>
<p>No mail on the skyline yet, its 8 wks now since one came to light so there ought to be a batch in any day now.</p>
<p>All hands have been going to bed early lately on account of our last stunt we can't seem to get over it &amp; catch up with the sleep.</p>
