<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are 3 or 4 haystacks- the result of the last year's harvest<br/>I have seen a good bit of the district during the past week, &amp; some of the very picturesque views that open up of the countryside are truly beautiful.<br/>Voting took place today on the Conscription Referendum; personally I should like to see Conscription come into force, &amp; of course voted accordingly; there is something to be said for both sides of the <strike>country</strike> question, but I think the pros outweigh the cons.<br/>I am keeping in splendid health, &amp; so far have been quite free from colds, &amp; coughs, I am thankful to say.  I was noticing the other day that the hole in the drum of the ear that Dr. Verge attended to about 6 months before I enlisted has closed right up.  Whether it has grown together or whether is has filled up with wax I can't say but I never have any trouble with it.  I haven't seen anything of Walter for close on a month now, but heard a few days ago he was O.K.<br/>Must close now with love to all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
