<p>[Friday January 14 1916]</p>
<p>Marched out at 6 A.M. for <strike>"Barrage"</strike> where we had camped before last April the prettiest spot in Egypt.  A 25 mile Trek made some of the horses sore &amp; tired  Fully equipped in full marching order is very different to riding in a stripped saddle minus   Rifle ammunition etc :- One troop has hurried on to Patrol a fresh water Canal feeding Alexandria from the Senuses who are gathering in numbers with some guns captured from the Italians on our West.<br/>Camel Corps is travelling with us &amp; horses never seem to get used to Camels</p>
