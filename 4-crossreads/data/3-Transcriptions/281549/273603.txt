<p>Military Policeman was killed in the village of Codford a little while ago, so these Picquets are held in camp to prevent any reoccurance &amp; restore order if any disturbance occurs in future.</p>
<p>On Sunday 24th Dec. I went to the village of Stocton &amp; one or two other places. The village church at Stocton was built in the year 1300. Inside the building is a list of the different Rectors names dating back to the year 1300</p>
<p>Some of the ancient inhabitants of the village are buried in the church, The vaults of some are let into the wall &amp; others are buried under the floor. A church in the village adjoining Stocton is a very old building being built in the year 1624. Some of the Tombstones are very old . some are dated in 17th century &amp; others are in the 18th &amp; 19th centuary.. some are even as recent as 1906 &amp; 10. I walked slowly back to camp arriving in time for tea. At night I wrote a few letters. Monday December the 25th. Christmas-day</p>
