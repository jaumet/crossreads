Next morning we fell in for parade was marched out into the desert had to start squad section drill all over again. Our parade ground was the battle field of the "Soudan War" the Arab trenches still to be seen there. They are not like the trenches of to-day for instead of being dug into the ground they are built up about eight feet high on top of the surface.
