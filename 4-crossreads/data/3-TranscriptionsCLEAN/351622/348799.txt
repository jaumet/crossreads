21 March TuesAttended sick parade 6.45 am. Ken & I are in the dispensary to-day & have some fun diagnosing the different cases finally finishing up with No 9's. Boat drill again today & also a big bath going & Orders say everyone is compelled to have a bath. Sea getting rough.
22 March 1916 WedA very quiet day in fact after I had done the dressings I turned in for the day. At night saw Ronnie & he procured me a couple of bottles of whisky & Bell, Sid Bragg & Arthur Preston polished them off in the orderley room. Passed Toulon about 8 pm. Arrived off Marseilles not long after. As I was just dozing off to sleep I could hear the anchor.
