<p>We have had some wonderful characters in the regiment, most of them have left since Gallipoli. A few come to mind "Tucker" Vienna Killed at Pozieres The Old Grey Mare (Cunningham) Prisoner in Germany Bennett (Crippled) who lost his voice Geordie ONeill still here in Transport Sergt Pennie badly smashed up Old Pat Hannaberry Senile decay :Squeaker" Dyson. Malsworthy Smith &ndash; "Allinga -  man to dig in!"  T. Rout now back in Australia.<br/>Battn. passing another. Tired men coming out of the trenches:- "What mob are yer?" [indecipherable] "Mob er goats"  "Crise, I knows that without telling!"</p>
