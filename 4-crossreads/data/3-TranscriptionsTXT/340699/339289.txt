 doubtful if there is much use in telling the authorities that for ascertaining the best methods of making models, I am in a position to consult men who know more about it than anyone else, because they don't know these men: I might just as well be reciting fictitious names. It happens that  Sir Harris Conway  C's right hand man is a friend of strike>Fullwoods  F and  Oswald Birley  B an old acquaintance of mine and a friend of  Alan  A's while  Poole &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P who is at Hyde Park is well known to me.

Arrived there I met the two officers in charge of the camp, one of whom I'd met before. They gave me a right royal welcome and immediately made most considerate arrangements for my stay. I did a couple of sketches of two favorite horses which found favour and promised to do them later
