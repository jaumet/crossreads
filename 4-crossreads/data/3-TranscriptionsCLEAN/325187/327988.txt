  
 [Saturday 2 September 1916] 
 Still Calm but cold this morning & a fog but feel better ere long.  I shall be hungry for some sun, I wish I had been sent to Australia now, but the better place takes too long- away from Regiment. Majority of men wonderfully better, & more cheerful. Sea is now a dirty green not the blue of Mediterranean & all the Boats we pass are very plainly branded all along their sides so no mistake can be made re neutrality. Crossing the Bay of Biscay now & a heavy swell on. We get the daily War News by wireless, nothing since Roumania came in, of importance, but we are only told what is good for us.
