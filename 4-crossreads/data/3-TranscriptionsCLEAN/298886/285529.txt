  
 a good swim in the Canal and about 30 of us got our names taken for bathing oh what a shame! We are to be punished for trying to keep ourselves clean when we have got the chance we may not have a chance in a couple of days. The natives are disporting themselves in the water and its quite clean but Someone says we mus'nt & so we must'nt but we will nevertheless The major who caught all us criminals reminded me of some prim and particular old school marm who has suddenly discovered all her class of young ladies  openly swimming! 
 17th MAY Wednesday 1916. 
 Hot winds blowing off the desert. Went out from Camp and took shelter under the green trees on Canal bank. 
 Didn't go swimming in the prohibited water today! But had a good swim in the Suez Canal instead. Quite legal! Large P&O Liner came past when we were in the water. loaded with Japanese troops and some English nurses bound for that unknown destination - Somewhere!
