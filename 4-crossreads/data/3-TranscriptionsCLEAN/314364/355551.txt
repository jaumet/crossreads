Tues. Feb.17 (cont.)We are steaming very slowly along the Canal.  The water is very calm & one would hardly think the ship was moving at all as she is so steady.Wed. Feb. 19.Woke up this morning to find the ship slowing down, as we were nearing Port Zufic. There were a number of other vessels anchored in the Harbor. We were not near enough to shore to see what was going on; so our stay was not very interesting. I washed a pair of slacks last night & put them out to dry on the roof of the Isolation Hospital. They were dry in about a couple of hours. If I am allowed to keep all the clothes I've got, I shall have quite a fair outfit. We had quite a good Dinner today Roast Lamb & vegetables.We took in quite a big consignment of Red X stuff, which ought to last us till we get to Freemantle. About 3 p.m. about 100 Light Horsemen came aboard. Most of them wore feathers in their Hats which gave them quite a "jaunty" appearance.
