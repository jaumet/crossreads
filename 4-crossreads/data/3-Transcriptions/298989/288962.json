<p>23/1/16<br/>Church parade last parade by Capt Bennett who returns per "Kanowna". Men put on style and marched in to band is splendid style. Big orderly room and the acid was put on some, - decent chaps who took leave when none was granted. One must be hard and make no excuses. Delightful the way they carry their cigarettes behind their ears. The lines full of washing some of our Reinforcement officers came down for the day, - theirs is an unhappy lot they are unwanted.</p>
<p>Fixing up the 8 &frac12;d ration allowance, put Bazeley on the job and had a little fun with the QM's Dept. More letters tonight. All the machine gunners in their tents and being Sunday tonight singing hymns in most dolorous tones. Group of sinners passing threw gravel on the tents and yelled out. "Shut up you bas - !" Received a bill from St Elmo hospital Malta for one handkerchief cost 3 1/2d. British red tape. Received orders for embarkation or rather entrainment to Ismailia.</p>
<p>24/1/16<br/>A day of bustle and stir. Struck all tents at 1100 and got them and all the baggage away. Piled arms and stacked accoutrements and cleaned the place up. Bivouacked all the men expected to move off anytime but we left them in a delightful state of uncertainty. The poor soldier is not told much! Lighted fires and all sat round their camp fires singing and yarning. Cold night for sleeping on hard ground but slept in tent myself. Camel corps men left us today some good chaps there. Experience some  &ndash;  300!</p>
