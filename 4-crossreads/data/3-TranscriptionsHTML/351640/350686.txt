<p>well mannered in all the affairs of life military and civil.  Were one to search round mongst all the people of my acquaintance no more vulgar savage, unconcerned about any but himself whether on duty or off, could not be discovered.  Selfish to a degree, his eyes glisten when food comes, as much as to say: how much of this for me.  Oh 'twas amusing to listen to him &amp; some other uninstructed savages talk about discipline.</p>
<p>In much better physical condition for two days, the amount of food consumed &amp; utilised by my interior has surprised me.  Good.  Should my internal organs perform their duties satisfactorily, flesh may grow upon me again.  'Tis nuisance not to be keeping in first class fettle.</p>
<p>Will letters come to me this week?  I hope so.  If they do not!  Well!  If they do not!  I shall still hope on.</p>

<p>30-3-15. 12-40 p.m. &ndash; Word this morning that another mail has arrived from Australia.  Wonder are there letters for me.  I hope not, because this but leads to disappointment.  However in this world one never knows when he may meet with fortunes smiles.  Happy thought struck me this morning.  Send the girls a cable for Easter, yet if sent as a week end wire you will not receive it till the Tuesday after the Sunday.  Shall think about the matter.  If the decision is in the affirmative you will have proof long before this reaches Australia, not before it is posted.</p>
