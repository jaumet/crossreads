<p>The Bedouins are reaping their corn all along the flat country of the Jordan valley or plain and Boaz &amp; Ruth are scattered all over the landscape also donkeys, arab horses, camels &ndash; pictures by the mile, but the everlasting sense of duty forbids &amp; I stick to "military interest".</p>
<p>My fellows of the War Records Unit are quite jolly &amp; my two troopers look after me well, so everything in the garden is lovely except flies, mosquitoes &amp; sandflies.</p>
<p>We move on to Jisr Benat Yakub a crossing of the Jordan about 20 miles above the Sea of Gallilee day after tomorrow &amp; then on to Damascus, Amman, Salt &ndash; and home!  Can't believe it but queer things happen &amp; I may yet live to show you how to drive tacks into linoleum but it must be in my shack in the bush.</p>
