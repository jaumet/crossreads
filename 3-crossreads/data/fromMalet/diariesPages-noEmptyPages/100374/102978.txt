The swallows are flying about here these last few days.

The foliage of the trees are beautiful. The fruit trees and hedges are beginning to blossom.

May 5th. Sat.
A Taube dropped four bombs near La Gorgue.

May 8th. Tues.
Walked along the canal banks and then round by La Gorgue. The banks of the canal are simply alive with small frogs. Every few steps one took there would be half a dozen little yellow coloured frogs plonk into the water

Our artillery seem to be simply pouring shells into the enemy. Our present staff of officers do not seem to realize what the work of a C.C.S. is. They are trying to fix them (the patients) up as if they are in a General Hospital. This entails a great deal more labour on the already overworked staff. One would not mind if it were necessary, but it is not necessary.

May 10th. Thursday.

Have got orders to pack up the C.C.S. We are going to take over another college at Bailleul and run it as a C.C.S.

Had another trip round by Croix du Bec, Bec-a-Mor, Sailly. Saw some of the damage that Fritz had done a few days previously. Three women were killed in one house.

Bill D. our driver is a very good fellow but he is a bit reckless in driving.
