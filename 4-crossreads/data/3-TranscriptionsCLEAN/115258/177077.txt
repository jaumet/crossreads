  
 I am glad Father has been able to put me in for that Warrobil block and hope we will be successful in securing it. It ought to make first rate stud sheep paddocks as long as the seasons are not too wet. If Fred is not working too hard, tell him to practise up his semaphore a bit - it will be handy when the boats are coming in. If he feals up to learning morse, its a great deal harder than semaphore, but takes a bit of learning at the start. Those parcels have not come along yet, but I'm expecting them any day now. The samples of Corriedale wool Father sent me have been much admired. I'm looking forward to hearing of the big price the wool has brought this year. Am just off over with Griffiths, Meadows, & Harold to the Red Cross room to get buckseech afternoon tea. We have been discussing lately what sort of tucker we are going to have when we get home; they all talk about their roast lamb and mint sauce etc but I say any old thing will do me as long as I can have a second help of any thing for two and a half years - you always get your issue here
