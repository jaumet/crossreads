<p>extremely light in this position so far. We are not in the front line though. We are in supports to the 55th Bn. Had a welcome little mail yesterday including a couple of letters from England. War news has been very scarce lately. We hear practically nothing unless we happen to be able to buy an English newspaper.</p>
<p>We are a little to the left of our last position on the somme. We are between Les Beufs on our right and Flers on our left. Delville Wood is directly behind us. It must have been a Devil of a Wood right enough. Large trees are blown to smithereens &amp; the ground is ploughed up yard by yard.</p>
