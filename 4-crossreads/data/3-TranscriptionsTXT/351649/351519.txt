My dear John &amp; Babs
Just a line to tell you I am strong in mind again &amp; regret that I could not see anybody on the day you wanted to come down, it was weakness not unkindness on my part.  All the time he was at the war there were many times at night when thinking of him I could hardly keep the throat lump down &amp; at last the dreaded day came, it was a nightmare to me to write to him even.  I would not go unburdening myself to you two only you've been good friends to Jock, Kathrine &amp; me &amp; I'll come &amp; see you as soon as I can &amp; laugh &amp; talk but never mention him to me till I tell you are to &amp; I am safe to do so.
As I say I am all right now but Saturday &amp; Sunday were bad for me &amp; all the Ellis family.  I have no right to monopolise all grief to myself, my poor old delicate Father has lost a son he was only my brother.  I'll guarantee my father will stand up to it &amp; lead by his example the Ellis family &amp; I am sure if Jock only knew it it would meet with his satisfaction.
You might think me nasty in asking you not to mention Jock to me for a while.  I tell you what it is.  When I go to Hay
