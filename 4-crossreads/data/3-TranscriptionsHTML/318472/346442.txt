<p>5 August 1918<br/>Monday<br/>Bank Holiday<br/>Reported carrier D17 torpedoed a few lives lost. Arrived Sierra Leone about 7.30 A.M. &amp; left about 5 P.M. about 10 fairly large boats lying at anchor &amp; an old Battle Ship. The place does not appear to be very large but it is rather picturesque &amp; pretty. High ridgged hills rise almost from the water &amp; houses can be seen away up on slopes. There is a fair sized English Garrison The growth of course appears to be semi tropical. Natives rowed the canoes across with bananas oranges &ndash; mangroves etc</p>
<p>1918 August 6<br/>Tuesday<br/>Cloudy with occasionally heavy rain &amp; wind All awnings taken down in anticipation of a gale tonight [indecipherable] rising and a fairly heavy sea running.</p>
