  
 be lying dead or dying.  I looked round at the crowd and they all appeared to be not in the least perturbed, while I felt myself turn pale, and my flesh all went "goosey".  I thought that either these people were absurdly brave, or that they failed to realise the awfulness of their position.  I waited breathless for the explosion, and the final scene, but to my astonishment nothing further happened, except that the whole crowd of us still moved upwards, but not with the suddenness that I had anticipated.  Eventually the upward movement ceased and the people started walking again.  I stayed behind to find that the cause of all my excitement and foolishness was nothing more than a huge "lift" for the conveyance of the passengers, to save them walking up the stairs.

 I went one day to have a good look over St. Pauls Cathedral, went in the main entrance, had a look round, listened to the service and came out by another door, and had to enquire my way back to my starting point.

 You can get some lovely trips on the busses into the country, to Reigate or Dorking, and many other places, so one Sunday morning having nothing to do, and feeling that I should like a blow in the country got up a bit earlier than usual, as I had heard that the busses were always "packed" on these country trips.  I saw a bus marked "Shoreditch" and was lucky enough to secure a top seat.  Paid my fare and settled myself down for a good blow of fresh air.  After travelling for about an hour, through nothing but dusty and dirty streets of the "slummiest"part of London, the bus "pulled up" in the vicinity of London Bridge, I being the only passenger left.  The conductor told me that this was the terminus.  I told him that I thought he was wrong and that as his bus was "labelled" Shoreditch, I expected him to convey me there, especially as I also had a ticket for that place.  He simply said "This is Shoreditch!".  I got off that bus and had to wait about half an hour in the heat and dust for another to take me back. 
 What a waste of time.  What a fool I had been not to have found
