<p>we shall never go into action again for I think Peace will be soon here. But one never knows what is going to happen, however I hope I will soon be paying you a visit so that sounds rather nice dont you think so Miss King. I had a most enjoyable time in England so I must settle down until I get home to dear Sunny New South.</p>
<p>We are just beginning to get the cold weather here so it is to be hoped we will not have to remain here for the finish of it.</p>
<p>Well Miss King I have no more news at present so will close with Best Wishes. Yours Sincerely<br/>Sergeant R. Otto<br/>2nd Btn. France</p>
<p>[Written at the top of the page:]<br/>I've not received the decoration yet but hope to any day now.</p>
