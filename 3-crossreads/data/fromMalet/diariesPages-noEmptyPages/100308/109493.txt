Another warm sunny day with a cool breeze. More detailed Brigade orders arrived for the stunt and we held a conference of company commanders to finally talk over things. The R.S.M., platoon sergeants and one private per platoon went on ahead to where Stewart had been last night to break up the dumps and get their contents ready distributed so they can be easily picked up. Later the patrols went up to get out at dark and gain command of No Mans Land. The markers for the jumping off tape are to go up with Hamilton later in the day. Rations were cut up and issued to individuals so every man is complete in himself with what he requires. I take Hunt and 4 runners to 185th Bde H.Q at L?homme Mort for liaison. The doctor picks up 24 extra ambulance bearers on the way up. Orders lay down that no Huns are to be brought in until our own chaps are attended to. Prisoners will carry wounded men back
