having the cleanest & best deck. The kitchens & bakery are swarming with the prettiest little cockroaches you could imagine - sometimes they serve them up with the soup, but not very often - at least I have only found them once or twice.
Today is Saturday & I have just come in from watching a boxing tournament. Some of the fights were very sanguinary & as the boat is rolling & pitching a good deal very funny to watch. Just as one would step back to evade the other, the boat would give a lurch & hurl him backwards against the ropes with his opponent, a whirlwind of blood & hair & flying gloves on top of him - much to the delight of the onlookers who would cheer & yell for their favourite till the final decision gave him the palm or the push.
Except for a few little entertainments such as this, we work & talk day after day exactly the same as we did the day before. This tournament will give us something fresh to talk about.
Heaps of love & remember me to father, Dorothy & Catherine.
Your loving son
Keith
P.S. I have just been in to see Jack. He is quite well & is coming out to-morrow, & wishes to be remembered to you.  K.
