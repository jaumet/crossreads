This might be the Englishmans idea of showing what his manners are to Australians for some knew Isaackson but I am inclined to think it is just their natural character &amp; lack of courtesy &amp; knowledge of the elementery rules of politness so unnecessary to selfish natures.</p>

<p>3-4-19 (Thur)<br/>Attended a Masonic meeting in Room 13 Hotel du Nord. Method of examination is slipshop &amp; embarassing. Richards is with me but Isaackson has gone to Paris. Dined with Richards &amp; then went to Brasserie de l'Opera when he left me &amp; I came home.</p>
<p>4-4-19 (Frid)<br/>This will be almost our last night in camp as school ends tomorrow though passed will not be ready till 7th so we have decided to have a dinner I have invited Isaackson &amp; we arrive</p>
