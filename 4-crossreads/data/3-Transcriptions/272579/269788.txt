<p>17th August to 5th September 1917 <br/>At Harborne Hall getting on the road to fitness again. Had a good time here, and was sorry to leave.</p>
<p>5th September 1917<br/>Transferred to Dartford Hospital in Kent. 17 miles from London. Pretty rough after Harborne.</p>
<p>14th September 1917<br/>Left Dartford for Weymouth Con. Depot.</p>
<p>24th September 1917<br/>Left Weymouth this morning for Park House Salisbury Plain as a case for Australia. Hope to be on a boat very soon unless I come the proverbial "Girtzer"</p>
<p>29th September 1917<br/>Still on this famous Plain. Have come this "Girtzer" in as much as my medical papers are missing, and so far see myself being left behind with a few others here. I hope anyhow to be lucky enough for them to turn up before the boat sails.</p>
<p>1st October 1917<br/>Papers turned up today. May have the luck to be with the boys after all.</p>
<p>2nd October 1917<br/>Name came out on the boat roll today.</p>
