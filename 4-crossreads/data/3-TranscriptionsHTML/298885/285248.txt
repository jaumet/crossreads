<p>Aug 23rd &ndash; 18<br/>This morning I set out to fulfil my promised visit to Mrs Armstrong and arrived at West bay (Dorset) about 5PM. Here are beautiful surroundings and right on the sea shore.</p>
<p>It is here that I fully realise the truth of clean sheets and fresh air. It is hard to say how I fully appreciate it after leaving the war zone with all its dust, evil smells and shattered villiages.</p>
<p>Aug 27th &ndash; 18<br/>Today I returned to London feeling entirely refreshed</p>
