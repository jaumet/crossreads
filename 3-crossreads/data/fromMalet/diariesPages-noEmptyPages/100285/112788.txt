for the afternoon I am making one of a party which are going out driving round the Island
I am no less than 9 days behind so I am just going to scribble on from memory without dates that's the worst of leave one has never time to keep his diary up for he is going all the time.
well I suppose I must start where I left off the drive I think it was, we were driven round some of the beauty spots of the Isle no doubt they were lovely real old country lanes every thing smothered with flowers, I have never seen such a variety before in my life, we were out 8 hours during which time we visited Castletown an ancient quaint old place with a very old prison
