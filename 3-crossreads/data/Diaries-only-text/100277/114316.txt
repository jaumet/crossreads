after the heavy march, but the morning was a beauty, sun shining brightly birds singing, ducks, fowls, cows pigs all kicking up a noise outside it reminded me of the old farming days what a country of contrasts, the firing line, then the lovely country behind.
We had a parade at 9 oclock, it was for the voting on the Conscription question we had everything ready in fact all the A's some of the B. had already voted, I was just about to record mine, when a "runner" came through from Hqrs to say that the voting was postponed till the 19th or 20th, so that settled the thing, we then took our platoons list of "shortages" again I would not like to say how many times we have got to take these before we get the articles.
