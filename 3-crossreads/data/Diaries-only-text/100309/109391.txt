11/6/17 Paris
end of the room is a big black oblong framed with gold and looking very blank. Our guide told us that Christ was meant to fill this but is left blank just to show how the French had completely wiped God out. The ceiling was most splendid here. Our guide left us here and we walked up through Les Halles along to the Grand Magasin de Louvre. Passing through here the perfumes were overpowering and erotic. The French devote great portion of their minds to sensuality ? my own room has a porcelain fitting with selz wash after connexion and Holmes has the same. Back to hotel by tube and saw Ella dining with her mother tte-a-tte. After lunch I met Monsieur Comshe deputy Roumanian parliament, avocat, and director of the National Bank and also met a few others. Talking to them I faltered on in dreadful French only to find them later using good English.
