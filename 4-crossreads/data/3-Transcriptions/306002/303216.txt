<p>2.7.15<br/>Fri. 2nd.  A sap is being put up through our dug-outs, we sig's have had nothing to do to-day, as Nelson has failed to secure a buzzer or Heliographs to practise with.  This afternoon a New Zealander dropped his rifle by accident, it went off &amp; the bullet went through his knee.  This morning we had some excitement as a kite was up from one of the boats observing.  A parachute was either freed or broke away &amp; came sailing down &amp; fell between our trenches &amp; the Turks, at least it appeared to be, some papers also flew out of it, just before it came to the ground, some falling in our lines &amp; some in the Turks.  The Artillery has been fairly busy on both sides to-day &amp; a howitzer firing from towards the beach &amp; dropping shells on the left of Popes Hill is doing considerable damage to the Turks.  Calthorpe was wounded by an 8.2 ins. shell on the face this evening.  Went for a swim again to-day.</p>
