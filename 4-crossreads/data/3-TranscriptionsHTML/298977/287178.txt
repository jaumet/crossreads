<p>At Sea.</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>A notice came out to-day that there is a probability of dropping a mail shortly, so I am writing this in rather a hurry.  There is very little further news to tell you, as ship life is very much the same.  I do not know whether you received my previous two letters or not, as I heard a rumour that neither mails had been dropped, so you will very probably get all three together.</p>
<p>Since writing last, I have joined the Machine Gun Section, which is a jolly sight more interesting than the ordinary Coy Drill, of course I have a lot to learn and am a long way behind the rest of the Section, who had been through their course at Liverpool, but I have a good chance here of picking it up.  I have for a long time been wanting to get in and naturally I jumped at the chance.  There has been some ----- practice on board which has been very interesting to watch.</p>
<p>I am feeling very well indeed and must be putting on a lot of weight, though it has been very hot lately.  I am not allowed to say anything as to where we are, and where we are going but to tell you the truth I don't know myself, there are so many conflicting rumours going about.</p>
<p>There has been some very good Concerts on board and boxing contests and there is generally plenty to do to keep going.  The life on board has certainly not started to get monotonous, in fact I can hardly find time to do my washing.  Have taken to sleeping out on deck of a night, down below being too hot.  The only trouble is that we have to get up at 5 o'clock to allow the decks to be swept, but by the time one has a bath or shower it is generally parade time.</p>
<p>I suppose Father is away on his trip by now.  I only hope it is doing him as much good as this one is doing me.</p>
<p>The sea is like a mill pond to-day, and it is over a week since we saw land.  Of course you know Harry is in the Section with me.  He wishes to be remembered to you all.  He is putting on weight every day.  There are also some very decent fellows in the Section.  Have mutual acquaintances with 3 or 4 of them.</p>
<p>Will of course write again as soon as there is a chance of dropping a mail.  Hope you and Ruby are well and are not worrying at all.</p>
<p>Love to all<br/>From<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Pte 1280 Roy Richards</p>
<p>Don't forget to add the Machine Gun Section to your next address.  All the rest of it must still go in.</p>
