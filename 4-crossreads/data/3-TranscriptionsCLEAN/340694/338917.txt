  
 32 28/7/16. Left Canaples & cycled to  Reprem  Rubempre & are quartered in a very nice cottage with a beautiful garden. Had a very good trip through secured a new bike the night before I left, it is a beauty. We had to walk up one long hill near Talmas. It was fully a mile in length & very steep but the view from the top was great. There are two very pretty curly headed kiddies here & a very nice young lady but I don't think we'll be here long. Are following up the "Great Push" & will be in it before long by all accounts. 
 30/7/16 Sunday & a beautiful day. Last night I went for a spin
