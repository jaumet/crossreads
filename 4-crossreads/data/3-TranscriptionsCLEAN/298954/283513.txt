  
 Tue.   21 Aug. Ill last night.  Violent pains.   A dose of opium (tincture) which I got from Fritz of the hospital in the early morning was almost as welcome as a release-order.   Went into hospital this morning.   The hospital (including a small operating room and a dispensary) is on the main deck under the bridge.   4 swinging cots and 3 bunks in the main room;  another small room with four bunks is just across the passage.    It  is a fearful place;  all artificial light;  (the only bunk which gets any daylight is the one squeezed away in the top corner.)   The orderlies are incompetent, careless, and slovenly.   Wolf the Omart is a very decent chap but he is quite incompetent. 
 Rees is in the next bed, "lead-swinging"
