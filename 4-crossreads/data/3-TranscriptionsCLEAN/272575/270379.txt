  
 to every girl in sight, which waving was vigorously responded to.   at last the train arrived, and we embarked, then waited again untill they had everything ready then twas goodbye Tidworth, but our troubles were not over.   Something went amiss up about the middle of the train, and when we arrived at Andover some of the men had to get out, then we were shunted into a loop out of the way and a man arrived with some tools, to fix the train up.   Some of the comments were humourous but I cannot repeat them here.   one man asked if a piece of string would  be of any use to tie it up.   there was something wrong with a coupling I fancy and there were many other things said about the train, that did not amuse the Rly officials who heard them.   They took the damaged carriage off and then away we went en Route once more for Wool.   at last we arrived got off the train, hungry and tired, it was 3 P.M. and we had not had any dinner, that did not matter as we were only convalescent, not fighting soldiers.   we formed up and set out for camp. arrived there and after some time some light refreshment was served out very light any way a loaf of bread between 4 men and a tin of Salmon between 6.   that nice old Salmon that is as dry as Sawdust.   I wouldnt like to move camp too often here.   The Department save too much on the meals that we dont get.   Coming down from Tidworth I saw some fine old Pheasants in the fields along the line, it must be fine sport Shooting them, they seem allmost as quiet as ordinary Poultry.   They were feeding amongst the stubble, and in some of the Ploughed fields, I also saw a few Partridge feeding in the stubble fields beside the line.  I will write some more tomorrow it is late so I will say Goodnight
