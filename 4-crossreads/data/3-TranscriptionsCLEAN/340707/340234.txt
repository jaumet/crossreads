  
 10-9-19 Visit Ministre & after met Mdlle [Marga] & we sit & talk in garden near Palais 
 About sundown the trees the leaves of which are already beginning to take their autumn tints a wonderful nuance of colour aided by a mist which in reality is only a shadow effect. At each instant the colour seems to change but only in shades. I shall for the future always have deciduous trees in my chateau grounds. 
 12-9-19 At atelier of Mdlle Brisson with Mdlle Marga & after that to Luxembourg on far side near Rue Guynemer with Chopin monument near. The long lanes never straight in this part of garden  all  overshadowed walks & patches of bright flowers far surpass any garden I have seen & leave a memory of beauty that [indecipherable] will always be present 
 16-9-19 Fountainbleau - rise 6.30 & take our dinner provided by Brise a fowl a bottle of wine, fancy biscuits & cake & fruit, not bad for a rural dinner in the forest. 
 We reach station & instead of going to town & chateau strike off in opposite direction the only ones to do so & as always untrodden paths are pleasantest we find a treasure trove
