 Thur. Ap. 25  -  Anzac Day 
 Glorious sunshining day. 
 Had good dinner and some were supplied with Beer. I had none, but as it was heavily watered, did not miss much. 
 George Lawson, Tich and I attended the Sports in the afternoon. Two Bands were there and a good number of Ladies. 
 After Tea went into Warminster to the Pictures.
