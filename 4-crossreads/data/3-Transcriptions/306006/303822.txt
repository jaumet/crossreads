<p>13-4-17<br/>villages &amp; dotted all over the country are orchards with green apricots, peaches &amp; figs but we are a little too early; all the orchards in villages have a hedge of prickly Pear which would take a good deal of negotiating &amp; it is these orchards behind prickly pear the Turks have their positions in Gaza<br/>I'd sooner face barbed wire; 6 of our planes bombed Gaza about mid day today. They are paying off an old debt of the 12th when 2 Taubes bombed our hangars at Rafa, our planes drop a ton of bombs for every one we receive; Patrols from both sides patrol to Shellal &amp; Beersheeba but no troops stationed at either place</p>
