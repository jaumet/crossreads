<p>July 4 a beautiful avenue of fine old oaks, beeches &amp; elms. Met 2 girls on the way home ?</p>
<p>5 The Lt. took us for a walk this morning , just a nice short one; we fell out had a smoke &amp; a yarn, returned to the parade ground &amp; then dismissed. Did a little fatigue, &amp; after lunch went to Weymouth &amp; was fitted out with an artificial eye. It's a little lighter than the other one but looks OK. Fred &amp; I went for another walk along the avenue</p>
<p>6 Putting in for 10 days leave today &amp;</p>
