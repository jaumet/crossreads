OCTOBER   TUESDAY 31   1916
Fairly fine. Got up to Edinburgh about 9 AM & had a bath & breakfast at the Caledonian Hotel & got a room there. Went out & saw mother afterwards & gave her a great surprise. We went round town afterwards & got some Xmas presents. Went out to Tarnhouse in the afternoon & saw Alan. I came in with him in the sidecar & we got a box & all went to see the "Scarlet Pimpernel" in the evening. It was good. Went out to Redford Barracks & saw Alan Keith Moses & Bill Tucker. Keith came to the theatre with us.
