<p>are on a special job which promises to last for about another week we are well away from the disturbing  beastly artillery and are enjoying ourselves really well. I manage sometimes to find time for a glorious ride through the surrounding country. It is all very pretty and interesting. Some towns fairly close to the line are quite intact, other are horribly "bent". By the way have you seen Bruce Bairnsfather's "Fragments of France" and "More Fragments" You cannot imagine how deliciously true to life they are.</p>
<p>J.W.S.Lucas is billeted within about half a mile of me. He is very well but thinks he is entitled to some leave to Australia. Of course he won't get it. I have had three or four good long yarns with him. He is very interesting and is as keen on his work as ever. Pitt is here with me and is well<br/>The Bn is still in a good quiet sector and having a fairly easy time but may move at any moment.</p>
<p>Best Love to Mrs. Ferguson and Dorothy<br/>Affectionately Yours  Caesar</p>
