<p>Letterhead as before.<br/>5.  I did a loaf about on Sunday all day.   Of course every night we had plenty of music &amp; on Sunday afternoon we never left the Piano.<br/>On Monday my last day of leave in the Island Marie &amp; I took our Dinner down to Jurby Beach.  We had one of those fitted-Baskets (picnic Baskets) which I carried on the handlebars of the Bike.  We could see Peel quite plainly from where I was sitting.  Marie &amp; I strolled along the Beach about a mile &amp; back again &amp; we had not long finished dinner when Auntie &amp; Uncle rode down.  We went for a long walk along the Beach in the other direction then &amp; saw where the Cliffs are gradually falling away into the sea.  Nearly every week there is a big slide somewhere along this part, this western side of the Island.  We took our time cycling Home as Auntie is not as fast as we younger ones.  It was only about 3 &frac12; miles ride.  Next morning I left at 6.15 am Marie &amp; Auntie driving down to the Station with me.  I had not slept since 3.30. am but I did not feel drowsy.  I arrived in Douglas O.K. &amp; in passing up Athol Street I ran my hand along the whole length of the old School Wall in Athol Street just above the Railway Station.  We left Douglas at 9 a.m.</p>
