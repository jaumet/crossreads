 FEB. &nbsp; SATURDAY 26 &nbsp; 1916 
 Fine &amp; cooler. I was on Cook&#39;s fatigue all morning and got leave till 6 pm but did not go back till late. Had dinner with Spes Wharton at Petty&#39;s and Came on over to Lisheen. Had a yarn with Linda on tennis court. She said &quot;that anything she asked me to do was not worth doing&quot;. Altho&#39; in a few things that may appear to be the case on the surface, I think that she knows it is not really the case. I often could have done things in town but I came over here instead, so in a way I am in the wrong. Anyway it hurt, whether I am right or wrong.
