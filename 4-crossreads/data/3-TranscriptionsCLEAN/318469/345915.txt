25thLeft Queen about 1.30 am with Destroyer towing.  Landed 4.30 amid a perfect Hell of lead fired when we were about 100 yds away & we charged through until we were only 10 yds away from Enemy.  Infantry charged magnificently & drove the Turks back over 1 mile before midday.  Shrapnel on landing & heavy firing continued all day but the operations were carried out splendidly.  The Turks position should have been almost impregnable. Our Infantry work was wonderful & drove everything before it.  Our casualties for day said to be about 2 Bttlns.  Our Coy lost 4 killed and about 4 wounded.
26thOur Forces continue to have good success.  Losses not so heavy as expected.  The bombardments of the Enemy's position by our boats was enormous & tremendous amount of firing being done & keeping the Enemy's reinforcements back British troops coming up behind Enemy.
