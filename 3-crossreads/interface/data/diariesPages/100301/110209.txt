when daylight came, right opposite where the shell burst was a shell hole a man was lying in it. I went had a look at him it was one of my own company, stone dead I found out afterwards that he had been having a sleep further up the trench when the Huns started to open out he said he would move to safer quarters he must have been passing just at the moment when the shell got the other two men.
We got a Priest at 9 am buried him further up the valleys where a lot of Australians had been buried. Corporal Charles Dent was his name the night before he had been showing me the Photos of his wife daughter, so when I went to collect my things close to where the shell had burst I was dumbfounded to find my waterproof sheet, riddled with holes a piece of shrapnel right through my Haversack into a tin of bully beef through the other side spoon fork broke into all my biscuits broken up.
so you can imagine what a narrow escape I had as I would have been lying there if the Corporal had not been going on duty offered me his place in the dug-out.
We went back by easy stages to Warloy again we were put in billets fitted out again also got more reinforcements which we need badly after such a lot of men gone west wounded. Our turn came round again to go into the line again this time we went into the trenches in the supports, where we did fatigue work, also small parties were sent up to clear away where the trenches had been blown
