<p>21 &ndash; E deM<br/>thing worth looking after and are treated accordingly.<br/>Wednesday, no more shore leave, broke a paltry oar or two and on account of that we are compelled to sweat ourselves on board without a chance of getting off again for a swim. The other crowd of course were ashore as usual all day having a dam good time. The irony of it is the other ships boats &amp; men are off just the same.<br/>The man Dow whom I mentioned before deserted on Wednesday &amp; was bought back again by the police from shore today. He refused to be taken under arrest as he considered himself as a civilian, but that did not prevent him from being bundled into the boob. I suppose his next ode will be to the injustice meted out to him, or about his prison cells etc.<br/>Relieved the lookout a midnight, a nice cool breeze blowing, it is a fine and safe harbour owing to the breakwater and being otherwise land locked. No danger of dragging anchor, never mind what direction the wind</p>
