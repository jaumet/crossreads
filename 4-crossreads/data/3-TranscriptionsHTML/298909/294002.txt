<p>23/6/16  Friday</p>
<p>Heavy wind blowing &amp; sea very choppy, so far feel pretty good &ndash; very tired all day, slept forard last night on deck &amp; only had a single blanket, nearly perished &amp; had very little sleep. A lot of the boys down to it. Quite close to us is a French Destroyer &amp; a Japanese Cruiser so we are in good company. Have on board 4 men from Warships to work the guns we carry aft<strike>er</strike> &ndash; The old Royal George is going some, but she is zig zaging a long way out of her course &ndash; we are manouevring the Islands of Crete, as it is a bit hazy, we cant see much on land.</p>
<p>I suppose we have on Board 2,000 Troops, &amp; General [blank]&amp; all the Doctors of the 14 &amp; 15th Field Ambulances. Had some lessons in French &ndash; also Boat drill &ndash; A man has got to get in position for the night before dark, or you cannot get about, it is very awkward without lights. A Boat which turned out to be tramp steamer approached too near us &amp; was immediately challenged by our guns so they are not risking anything in this zone.</p>
