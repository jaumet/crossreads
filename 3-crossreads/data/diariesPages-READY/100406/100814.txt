Gallery. In outside appearance it simply cannot compare with the Cathedral at Amiens. The lofty nave and Gorgeous Altar of Amiens Cathedral also appeal to me, but owing to the different styles it is hardly fair to compare the nave and external aspect of the two. The mosiac work in the interior is very beautiful. The Great Altar also give an impression of purity richness. I think St. Pauls must have been a Catholic Church once.
I had a hurried look through the Natural History Museum at South Kensington afterward. I only went there to see the famous Piltdown Skull. I seen a very ancient one but am not sure that it was the one I was looking for. Attend a Fancy Dress Ball at Battersea Town Hall in the evening had a good time. It is very funny to see the Londoners piloting their country relations about during the Holidays. There are always a few admiring the Horse Gaurds. Londoners tell one that neither the man or the Horse moves while on Post but that is all Bosh.
