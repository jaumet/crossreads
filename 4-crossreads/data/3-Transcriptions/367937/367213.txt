<p>passage cut out of sand stone and showed us the the family tombs of the Romans; we could not understand how they worked it as the tombs were only pidgeon holes cut in the side of the passage however after a lot of trouble  the guide explained to us that they were cremated and only the jars of their ashes were put here.<br/>I am very lucky having such nice chaps as Rostron &amp; Nelson to go about with and also Tim Alworth is here so I am well off for mates.<br/>You ought to have got my letters from Port Suez by this; I hope to get a great mail when I get back to camp again.<br/>That letter you wrote to me to Egypt (no. 1) had half a page on the back of it with nothing on it; please don't let that occur again!!<br/>We are issued with a green envelope here every week and they are not censored by officers who know us, however there is nothing in your letters that I mind them seeing and so unless I write and extra long letter to you or have any private business to tell I'll keep the green envelopes for writting to the girls! Hey?<br/>Will you send me a list of people who got my photos please, I am rather interrested about it.  Did Kitty get hers?  I guess poor Olives is right out of it &ndash; hope nobody cuts me out while I am away.  Love to Father. Wonder whether he is in Sydney now? Good bye Mother dear<br/>Your loving son<br/>Rob.</p>
