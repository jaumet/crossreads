<p>27th Jan (Thursday)<br/>Raining &amp; bitterly cold. Trouble at canteen &ndash; About 500 men were waiting to be served when they discovered that officers' batmen were going in through the back door with special orders from officers. This upset the spirits of the crowd so a party of burly chaps from the Peninsular headed by Roy Hoffman from Brighton made a raid on the batmen and cleared off with the goods. Two Aeroplanes sighted. Last of our outposts in from Hockley's Hollow. There are now 14 men in our tent so things are in a bit of muddle</p>
