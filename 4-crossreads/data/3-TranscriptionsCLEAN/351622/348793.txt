9 March 1916 ThurCalled to see Jim Fay last night & also Jack Kater. Reinforcements arrive. Dug a new cess pit the best part of the day. During the march yesterday we halted & rested at the A.S.C. where I weighed myself to the surprise of putting on a stone & a half since I joined the army.
10 March 1916 FriPractising getting kit's ready all the morning. Aeroplanes here are very common. You see them overhead all day. Spent the afternoon on the water-waggon so never had a thirst up. Met Lieut McK. Paid again this afternoon so the old water proof sheet candle & pack of cards will be in full swing to night.
