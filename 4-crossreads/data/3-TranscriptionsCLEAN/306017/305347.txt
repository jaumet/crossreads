June - July 1916the same night.  It is a nice little camp in an oasis.  There is a big change noticeable.  Railway in full swing & many more camps.  I got some mail including letters from cousin Carrie & Meg, also letters from Carrie mother & Doug. & numerous papers.  During my absence the Regt had 3 or 4 trips into the desert & got into touch with the Turks capturing some camels & killing & wounding a few Turks.  They also dug some wells at Oghratina which will make these stunts much easier.  There is a fair bit of aerial activity & our machines try & engage the enemys planes as often as possible.
The horses are looking fairly well.  The months spell at Hill 70 did them a lot of good but they felt the first big reconnaissance to the East of Bir el Abd  about 30 miles each way 60 miles altogether in the 2 days.  Many of them had sore backs.  On the 19th the 6th & 7th LH & the Wellington Mounted Rifles
