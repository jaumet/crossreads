  
 then walked to Ludgate Circus in order to buy some books having lunch on my way in Fleet st., a good meal with a bottle of wine & coffee to finish up.   Then met D.W.A. & went along to Burlington House to see The Imperial War exhibition.   It had just been opened and was first rate being a collection trophies, guns, planes, helmets notices etc and a large number of photos.   An Australian section was very interesting, the photos being familiar.   One huge photo showed the Australian band 18' x 10' marching in Bapaume.   There was also a section showing the work of Munitions.   We then had tea at The Popular Piccadilly Circus proceeding next to The Leicester Galleries where there was an exhibition of drawings by Will Dyson.  Several I recognised especially one of the Gas Centre I controlled on the Menin Road.   It was a splendid drawing, absolutely true to life & brought the same scene back vividly to my memory.   Went out to NottingHill
