  
 Monday 30th July 1917 Dickebusch Cleaning harness. Guns very quiet in the early part of the evening. Now and again our camp would get a shake as a 13.2 naval was fired. Stunt started about midnight. In an instant the air and earth shook and the whole horizon blazed as our 100s of guns broke at once. The horizon was rimmed with flickering flare of every tint of yellow down to the dull red glow of burning oil with the shock and clamour of the guns of the guns it was thrilling beyond words.
