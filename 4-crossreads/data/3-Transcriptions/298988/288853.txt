<p>of them, got cut up early this morning &amp; there are a lot of wounded from both sides on the beach. Unfortunately, the Officers of our men, had a terribly hard job to keep our fellows back &amp; they fired early this morning, whilst still in the boats, without instructions.</p>
<p>The Ships here now include the London, Queen Elizabeth, Majestic, Prince of Wales, The Queen, Bacchante &amp; a few Destroyers.</p>
<p>12.10 p.m.<br/>A report just came off that there are only one or two of our chaps killed but a goodly number of wounded. One of the horse punts were sunk just as it was leaving the beach after landing its load. No one was killed, but the few sailors in it got a ducking.  Shrapnel shell caused it.</p>
<p>1.30 p.m.  Have landed the balance of A Section of the Mountain Battery, &amp; have been instructed to get out to an anchorage off Imbros Island which is a Greek possession 10 miles further away.</p>
<p>I have been wishing we would remain where we were, as it was a bonzer view although we were not altogether "free from danger".</p>
<p>Latest reports state that our boys are doing grand &amp; have captured several Turks &amp; 2 German Officers,  Our landing is one of four which took place simultaneously &amp; I believe the idea is to converge on one point &amp; endeavour at the same time to cut the enemy off.  Besides these landings there were several "feint" attempts</p>
