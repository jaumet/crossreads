Spent half the night enjoying our contents of the parcels from home, some of the cake was spoilt but everything else was OK, Alec sent a parcel to all of the old boys good oh too they all appreciated it very much, no parcel from the girl came to hand though guess its alright though.Exercising as usual Mel went down to Teiria today had a good trip. I renovated my scrap cleaned her up. Mail was sorted today I got two ? one from Nora the other from Nell. Nora's was to the point asking me what I had done with Vere's diary, Victorian mail is expected in tonight so hope there's a further addition to my list of letters bed at 9.30, Mustard went to town bought three violins oh! for some music after this.

Revielle as usual.
Went for the usual ride in the morning had one gallop which came off successfully for Len, stayed in in the afternoon as Hal had a friend coming up to see him, I went up to meet the train but found that there had been a break down on the line he would probably arrive about 6 or 7 oclock. All sorts of rumors are afloat as to when the Bediouins are coming it is said that they are in touch constantly at Waddi Natrun that the whole force is returning from Mersa Matruh are credited with the skill of being able to give us a good go. Wrote letters home Nell then retired after accounting for more of our gift stuff.
