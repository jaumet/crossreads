<p>unforseen happens.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Frank Bailey, my old cobber that was wounded at Hill 60, he is at Weymouth waiting for a boat back home, said he will always have a stiff leg, still he is lucky to be clear of the whole game.  I am going to write to him &amp; tell him to go &amp; see you when he gets back if he has time, he will be able to tell you what things are like over here &amp; he is a good straight chap so make him welcome if he does come along.</p>
<p>We have still been having good weather although the last four days it has turned a bit showery</p>
