 Memories of Egypt 
 Egypt depends entirely on the Nile for its water supply, and there is exactly two points of rain recorded in Cairo for the whole year.  Cultivated  area  land meets the eye everywhere especially running alongside the railway and the sweet water canals.  The land is very fertile from the rich mud which is left behind from the annual overflow of the Nile.  All the watering is managed by a system of irrigation. 
  Such  Australians will never forget the land of rock and sun with its endless sandy deserts and the ever penetrating sun above. 
 Memories of the wonderful pyramids, the beautiful mosques, and the innumerable antiquities of that most interesting country will ever remain fixed in our minds.
