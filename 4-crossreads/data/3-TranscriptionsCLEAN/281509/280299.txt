Tattoo this morning for all who was absent from parade last evening about 150 guilty. Some were fined 10/- including self. Bob Tony & self go off to town on leave & call at Comforts Depot & receive handkerchiefs & fly nets.Then we go round to Woolloomooloo  Bay & view the Armadale. No one preventing us we go on board & see what we have to make our home on for 38 days. Ye Gods! What a tub & dirty. I go home with Bob to tea & stay the night whilst Tony goes to Neutral Bay. We go to pictures at the Junction after tea.
