<p>Justicia, 33,000 tons off Ireland.</p>
<p>Saturday 27th July<br/>Very quiet.  Had a visit from the 12th Fld Amb who are taking over.  The line is being strengthened as we have handed over a piece to the Tommies.</p>
<p>Sunday 28th July<br/>Everything normal until midday when we had word through of a stunt to come off in the morning.  By night we had everything ready, extra blankets &amp; stretchers sent forward besides dressings etc necessary.<br/>Also another surprise that the Tommies are taking over from us so that we have either been fooled or else events have transpired which call for the alteration.  Personally I think 'twas intentional as secrecy is tried hard for nowadays.  I expect that we will be relieved on Wednesday but the Colonel himself didn't know.  'Tis very hard to keep things secret &amp; from being talked about as the men can now judge</p>
