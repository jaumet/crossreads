<p>Dear Miss King</p>
<p>Am dropping you a few lines letting you know that I have commenced my long journey for home.</p>
<p>I left my Battalion on the 13th of Feb. for a demobilisation camp at Le Havre and expect to be leaving any day for England. I expect to be in England some time before I embark for dear old Aussie but nevertheless I will soon be home. We were very unfortunate not going to Germany, but I think the authorities were wise in not sending us.</p>
<p>I hope you are in the best of health after all the good work you have been doing for the last 4 years and I sincerely hope I return and find you all well and contented.</p>
<p>Best Wishes<br/>Yours Sincerely.<br/>Sgt. R. Otto. 2nd Battalion AIF.</p>
