 Sunday 21 April Dog tired last night, but toothache kept me awake a long time. Lovely Sunday morning, clear &amp; cool. A band is playing somewhere, &amp;amp a few men from 9th Batt  headquarters are drilling on the other side of the pond at the back of this barn. At present our breakfast is being cooked. Heavy bombardment last night, but the German push rumours did not materialize.
