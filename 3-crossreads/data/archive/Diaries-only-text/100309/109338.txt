14/5/17 Mametz
Heard today that we are moving back to Achieux for further rest. Work this morning was specialist training mostly. About 80 bombers and 90 Lewis gunners at work. Inspected the huts and found things fairly good as Thwaites is an able orderly officer. If not well watched a great deal of waste occurs here where so much canteen stuff can be bought to supplement the ration. Pork or beans and bully beef are very dead stock. Reviewed our new reinforcements and find them quite a good stamp. Weather continues very warm and thundery. After lunch saw N.C.O's class at work and stayed with them until 4.00. just as we were forming up heavy rain came up and drenched us before we traversed the few hundred yards back to camp. Some German prisoners working round here and if carrying anything they salute by a sharp turn of the head smartly. Bazely was in after mess to say goodbye before going on leave ? a dear little chap.
