<p>16/4/18 &ndash; Lavieville<br/>no one was at all the worse.  Walked up forward to Pioneer Trench, passing through a moderate barrage and met Rodda and Sparrow discussing several matters of carrying &amp;c.  Our guns knocked down this afternoon the celebrated Falling Virgin of Albert commonly known as Mademoiselle or Fanny Durack.

Grey wounded.</p>
