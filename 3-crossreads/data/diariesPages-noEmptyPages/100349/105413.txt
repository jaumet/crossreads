Rain stopped Parade this evening. Two deserters from this Battalion who were sentenced to be shot were liberated today. Was offered a "bar" as a tempory Acting Unpaid, wouldn't take it for various reasons. It is bad enough to be a senior Private and have to do their work, without being entitled to the abuse.
