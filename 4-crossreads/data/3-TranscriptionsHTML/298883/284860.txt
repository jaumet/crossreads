<p>Mess tonight in the old style, though the welcome was a dry one, which was just as well perhaps.</p>
<p>25th<br/>The 53rd Bn. held their Bn. Sports today.</p>
<p>Our boys still on strike.</p>
<p>26th<br/>This morning I watched the boys of the 54th that is the strikers as they might be termed hold a battalion parade under the command of a full blown private and they behaved splendidly.  Bde sports were held this <strike> evening</strike> afternoon and went off O.K.  I was assistant starter and bawler out until my throat got sore when <strike>the</strike> Major Lucas took on the job.  A <strike>n</strike> despatch came along about 5.30 p.m.</p>
