<p>joke</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The infantry (those chaps who walk and fight on foot) no longer call us the Light Horse Brigade. They call us the Lost Horse Brigade. (This is infantry humour).</p>
<p>There is one joke here that is too good to keep. The Indians say: &quot;When the shrapnel shells burst overhead, the English run to the dug-outs, the Indians pray to Allah, but the Australians just look around and exclaim &quot;where the hell did that come from?&quot;</p>
<p>Another alleged joke. A <u>bread</u> ration was issued a few days ago instead of the inevitable biscuit ration. One trooper half in fun exclaimed: &quot;Well, they might have given us butter with it.&quot; &quot;Butter&quot; cried his mate in astonishment, &quot;Why, you&#39;ll be wanting flowers on your grave next.&quot; ..</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got some rather good jokes, but I&#39;ll have to keep them till I get home.</p>
<p>Good bye- every-bodys. I&#39;ve got to go ashore soon. Had a ripping day. (I&#39;m too lucky Jean).</p>
<p>Love of love and tons of luck,</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>OL.</p>
