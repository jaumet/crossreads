 My dearest Moth.   &  Sisters, 
 Have not received any Aust. Mail this week, but suppose shall get it in due time. 
 Well, we have been very bush packing - all our patients have gone   &   Tents down, the place looks miserable but for a change are not rushing it. Waiting now for moving orders, which may come through any moment now.
