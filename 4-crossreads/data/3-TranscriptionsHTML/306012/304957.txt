When it got too dark to see any longer we lay down on the floor of the truck for a bit of a snooze &ndash; as far as our cramped condition would allow.  At 1.30 a.m. we were aroused and detrained in the drizzling rain at Harfleur.  From here it was only a short march to the Aust. Gen. Base Depot at Rouelles, our destination.  It appears that no-one knew we were coming and no accomodation was ready for us.  Two of us managed to find a temporary home on the stage of the big Y.M.C.A. theatre in the camp.  Next morning I was able to see how beautifully situated the camp was.

Everyone was moving about fairly early after a chilly but calm night and the Isle of Wight passed about 7 a.m.  Two hours later on a fine morning we brought up at the docks and disembarked, to march straight on to the railway platform.  A very pretty little part of the country was then traversed in the train when we travelled through Andover Junction &amp; Ludgershall to Tidworth &ndash; the big Australian camp centre.  Here there was a big mob of Australians from the English front, W.A.A.C.S., nurses, Y.M.C.A.-ites, civilians, etc. etc. to greet the heros from the war, a brass band blared something or other and there was a general</p>
