7/12/17 Hazebrouck St Omer. Mt. Kemmelland St. Omer. Just outside the latter is an old donjon tower like the Tower Jean d'Arc at Rouen. The fine old town lies sprawling on the flats.  We went right through to the poor village of Leulinghem and there saw plenty of bombarding by flying pigs &c. hundreds of officers were collected here. Lunched in St. Omer and did some shopping having a fair run back and then walking out from Locre in the dark. Found plenty of work awaiting me and reams of papers. "A" Coy had their dinner tonight and it went off well. This was Xmas dinner in case we die in the line then.8/12/17 Marched out at 10 am to Bde. Sports where there was a successful day's events. The weather was not bad. Lunched at the 23rd. Battalion & obtained the second highest number of points in the day. Attended "B" Coy's dinner in the evening - a great and sumptuous "feed" not to say "gorge".
