<p>especially at Wellington.  Miss Bert not being here this time as we met here both trips before.  If you are writing him tell him of my rise he will be glad to hear it as we were talking about it last trip when I saw him.  Mr Anderson the 2nd steward was telling me just now that he heard the Atua was to be here on Tuesday.  I hope so would like to see him.  Harry Lauder is a great attraction just now.  His photo is posted up every where they say the Ladies are copying him in hats.  They are all wearing Lauder hats.  Well Father there is nothing to tell.  Won't be long before we are in Sydney again now.</p>
<p>Tell Miss Smith I haven't secured any P. Cards for her yet but am on the look out for some.  Love<br/>From your sincere son<br/>Clyde</p>
