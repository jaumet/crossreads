<p>are few bands about, The City of London has a brass band and another corps has drum and fife, it livens things up a little. I expected that we would be in Alexandria by now, but I think they have forgotten all about us. A few promotions acting ranks are out. Far Sgt Quelch to be acting Far Major promoted by the Vet. No such rank in the Artillery. Capt Thompson to be Major of the 2nd Bty, Major Rabbett to be O.C. Howitzer Bty, Capt Callaghan and Lieut Selmes all 2nd Bty to go with him.<br/>1/11/1915<br/>A light shower last night, and then a gale, very rough night. A bit colder than usual this morning. The Asiatic guns were peppering one of our submarines going along the coast. They fired about 100 shots at it and a destroyer, some shots close but no hits. A few shells on the beach, hit a mule and it went sky high. The 6th Bty wagon line moved over near our lines. Terrific row between Vet and Farrier Sgt. The Farrier reported him to H.Q. and his O.C. It is almost impossible</p>
