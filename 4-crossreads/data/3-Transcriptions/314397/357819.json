<p>Went to MER  &amp; to EU. Mer on the sea much like le Treport &amp; is very nice. EU is a big place &amp; very clean. Had a look at the big church there &amp; just after coming out from it Dinney Shearer came along on a charabanc, so went back to Le Treport with him. He &amp; I went up to the 2nd General Hospital &amp; had a talk to two or three wounded Aussie officers there. Rained all day &amp; spoilt a good night away. Left there about 7.30 &amp; missed rain all the way. Gee we were lucky tho.</p>
<p>Monday. 9.9.18.<br/>Rained all day. In the morning we had lectures &amp; in the afternoon we just had time to do an exercise &amp; then more rain &amp; lectures. Boxing postponed on a/c of rain.</p>
<p>Tuesday 10.9.18<br/>Orderly officer today &ndash; nothing much extra to do. Have to attend the course all day. Had lectures all the morning on a/c of the rain but in the afternoon went to the range shooting. Got 14 out of 20.</p>
