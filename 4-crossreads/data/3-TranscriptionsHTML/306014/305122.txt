<p>an apple had been stowed away in my pocket for company. After being treated so well by strangers who knew me not, I felt exceeding happy &amp; with a light heart &amp; with a song on my lips &ndash; metaphorically of course &ndash; I picked my way through the darkness. The road was very dark &amp; lonely; there is not a single house near it for about nine miles. At first the stars did make a feeble effort to twinkle down on me but soon the lowering clouds turned black &amp; darkened the heavens, the wind began to blow &amp; to get cold &amp; biting &amp; then a little later the rain came down &amp; tried its best to find its way down my neck. This part of the scene was acted twice on the way but nevertheless I arrived home safe &amp; sound at 3.15, next morning &amp; after making my bed in the dark, found "peace in sleep".</p>
