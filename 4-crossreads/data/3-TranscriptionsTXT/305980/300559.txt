 October 
 1:  Inspected by Gen. Allenby.  All men of our unit who were not supplied with decent clothing not allowed on parade.  Some of our boys have been going about with the knees out of their breeches for weeks &amp; good boots seem to be a luxury.  I only had shorts on, as it is over a month since my breeches had to be thrown away, being threadbare.  The state of things regarding food &amp; clothing is scandalous &amp; a disgrace to the heads.  We feed ourselves on our 2/- per day pay, as we get enough for only one decent meal as our 24 hrs. rations. 
 3:  Left "Kilo 9" at 8 a.m. again camping on the beach at Raffa, to spell our horses, who are on fearfully scanty issue of feed &amp; the recent heavy stunting has knocked many of the poor animals out. 
 7:Mail today, first we have had for nine weeks.  Taube brought down at Kebir, both occupants being uninjured &amp; machine captured by light horsemen intact. 
 10:  More cleaning up; but our boys were not too particular with it this time; and we have had a good spell so far.  Food is much better now after all our complaining.  Decent concert by 2nd Bde. in Y.M.C.A.: rained heavily all night.
