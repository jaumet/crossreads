<p>[Press cutting]<br/>Newington's War Record</p>
<p>The honour roll of Newington College contains 430 names of those who have actually enlisted.  Four more have gone to England to serve as munition workers, and 18 have been engaged on home service, making a total so far as can be ascertained, of 452.  Thirty-five have died either in action or as a result of wounds, one has been drowned, four are missing, and one is known to be a prisoner of war.</p>
<p>Among the dead are several of exceptional promise.  Major Campbell was killed early in the war.  Major Moffat Reid was a gallant Light Horse officer.  Captain D.S. Freeman was a mining engineer.  Captain H.K. Moek, Captain Jekyll, Sergt. Murray, Corp. Holliday were, as boys, at the top of the school, and had distinguished school careers, while Lieut. V.S. Warry, Sergt. Lovett, Trooper Jeffrey, and Trooper Pountney were distinguished athletes.  Seventeen have been mentioned in despatches.  Of these, two have won the D.S.O., seven the Military Cross, three the D.C.M., two the M.M.  It is noteworthy that the two with the D.S.O., Colonel Mackay and Captain Petersen, were amongst the most dashing footballers of their day.  The same remark applies to the M.Cs., Captain Millner, Captain J. McDonald, Lieuts. H. Moffatt, C.R. Wise, and O.H. Woodward.</p>
<p>The contribution of doctors has been large, and of these two, Captain T.E. Parker and Captain H.J. Orr have been mentioned in despatches.  Fine service has been rendered by all, while Major W.M.A. Fletcher is reported to have had an extraordinary popularity in the hospital where he has served.  Several have served as chaplains &ndash; Revs. E.M. Boyer, D.D. Hunter, A. Meek, V.W. Thompson (naval), and W.C. Francis.  Lieutenant C.K. Nelson, who enlisted in England, was one of the most distinguished schoolboys and University students of his time;  in spite of wounds he still serves.  In the early stages of the war many enlisted in the Light Horse.  Latterly the Artillery has claimed some of the best, no one of these being better known than Gunner J.M. Taylor, whose exploits with the bat for his school, and then for the State, were the talk of his time.</p>
<p>Amongst those engaged in service at home are some leading surgeons, including Sir Herbert Maitland, Dr. Perkins, Dr. George Abbott, and Dr. C.H. Lawes, for a long time P.M.O. in military camps.  The headmaster, Rev. C.J. Prescott, has been acting senior chaplain for his Church almost from the beginning of the war.  The work of Mr. H.E. Budden, as War Chest Commissioner, is so well known to the public that it needs no mention here.</p>
<p>It is interesting to take up old photographs of teams or of prefects to see how in many cases there is scarcely one that has not enlisted;  and those who have not are in many instances medical students, who will enlist as soon as they are qualified as practitioners.  One of these groups contains nine boys.  Of these three have been killed, three are now serving, and one is a medical student.  Of the 1915 cricket eleven two are still at school and two at the University;  the rest have enlisted.  Of the 1912 premier football fifteen three have been killed, one is in the Medical School, and the rest are serving.  The centre forward of the 1917 team has just enlisted, while the vast majority of the later prefects and scholarship holders have answered the call.</p>
