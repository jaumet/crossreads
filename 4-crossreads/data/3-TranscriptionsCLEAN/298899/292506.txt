being a very hot morning only having10 gas cases through I helped with evacuations and unloading etc. Our gunfire on the quiet side. As I write this about 9 p.m. he has started again to put over some heavy stuff which is falling unpleasantly close. I still have to marvel at the way men can carry on under these conditions After a while the majority produce a kind of indifference to it all & move about freely while the shells are falling & see their comrades horribly mutilated in front of them. Some of the ambulance tyres show where they have been running through blood & yet it makes no difference, the majority just carry on. Our Colonel was wounded today & Major Metcalf & several of our bearers & a couple more killed, so many in fact that I have lost count.
Wednesday 26th Sept. 1917 A very heavy day for all hands. Our artillery opened up at 5.45 A.M. & our fellows went over. Shortly after 8 the wounded began to come in
