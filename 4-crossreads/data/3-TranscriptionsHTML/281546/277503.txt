<p>Boys and Girls have very little schooling and can hardly write their own name. <br/>Easter Saturday April 19th  As I  recorded in my Diary my first trip driving on Active Service. I was nearly forgetting my last, this trip was on last Monday with the Ration Train from the Depot "Pende" to Conchil le Temple and back along to Dowleger and return, I signed on at 7.30 am and prepared Engine 1803,W.D.2.8-0 with Fireman Whittingham and at 9am left Conchil with the first lot of Rations, The weather was very rough, Blowing very hard and very cold, my mate <strike>prepared</strike> obtained a small Tarpaulin and hung it on the back of the Cab and tied it down, we soon  arrived at Conchil running Engine First and at 9.30 we started on our journey back, as we were now running Tender First, we soon felt the force of the Wind, we could hear the Coal being blown against the Tarpaulin and when one looked out, you would get hit in the face with flying</p>
