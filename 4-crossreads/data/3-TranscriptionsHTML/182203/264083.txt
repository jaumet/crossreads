<p>her I'm in England. Have not looked up any of Mr Copp's relations yet but shall do so if remaining many more days here.<br/>Well, we've had a busy week. Getting our clothes fixed up &ndash; everywhere we go seem to have some alteration in our cape, cloaks etc. or hats &ndash; Now we have to wear shoulder straps with our stars &ndash; so we are some <u>swank</u>. I have bought a <u>bonzer "Soth Wester"</u> coat    &amp; hat for the rain. We are allowed to wear them, also strong boots &amp;  goloshoes .. fortunately my warm singlets are in good order &amp; stockings, which I could not wear in Egypt, also warm nighties.<br/>I can see my money going fast, need umbrellas &amp; all sorts of different  clothing so don't be surprised if I have to cable for money. Am alright so far. Travelling about is rather expensive    &amp;  we are about <strike>indecipherable</strike> 1 hr 30 mins. out of London, so often have to take our meals out because trains &amp; tubes do not fit in.</p>
