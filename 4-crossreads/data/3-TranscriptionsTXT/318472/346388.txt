12 June 1918WednesdayLeft Hurdcott about 8. a.m. & arrived at Brightlingsea about 5. P.M. After much changing about on the railway. Having nice fine weather The country about here does not appear to be so nice & fertile as in Wilts.
1918 June 13ThursdayDoing nothing in particular today. Met a lot of old boys in this Depot. In the evening there was a concert given by some London party. Only just fair Brightlingsea appears a nice little Village - probably about 5,000 inhabitants & boasts a small - very small - shipbuilding yard.
