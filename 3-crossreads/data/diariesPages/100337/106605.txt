our party.

There was seven battalions in the attack altogether, but the 13th 14th 15th & 16th Battallions which comprise the 4th Australian Infantry Brigade suffered the heaviest casualties. The section that the attack was made on, was the â€œHindenberg Line" between Reincourt & Bullecourt.

I estimate the casualties at 2,000 Killed & 14 hundred Prisoners, The Majority of wounded were amongst the Prisoners taken.

This attack was always known as the Bullecourt blunder amongst the men. But with good management it would have come off alright & not one twentieth of the casualties would have occurred.

The reason why the Tanks failed us, was through the lack of artillery support. The Tanks given a proper chance are the best wepons that have been used in this war to work with the Infantry.
