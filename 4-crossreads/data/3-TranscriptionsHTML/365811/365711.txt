<p>14.2.18</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I have nothing fresh to tell you since my last letter we are still in this very happy home with a great many creature comforts and very little attention from the Bosche.</p>
<p>I have just completed a shift from 1.30 &ndash; 4.30 AM &amp; am just being relieved. I have managed to clean up most of my letter writing troubles, the only interruptions being from a horror of horrors known as the field telephone. These are generally in code &amp; take some little time to decode. Apart from them the night is as silent as can be. This place is the quietest I have been on &amp; will suit me admirably until the cessation.</p>
<p>I shall now go and pull my relief out of his warm bed.</p>
<p>Am very fit<br/>Best Love<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C R Lucas</p>
