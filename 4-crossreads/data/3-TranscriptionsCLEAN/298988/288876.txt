  
 The Turks losses at Cape Helies have been very heavy, exceeding ours it is said.  They do not bury their dead & this has to be done by our men.  The poor Marines, who were landed by the Navy, during their lone hand attempt were horribly tortured. 
 May 5th 7 a.m. Our usual morning shells have just fallen.  It is most remarkable this, because it only happens every morning early & then we get no more all day.  The enemy must bring up a gun somewhere, during the night, fire a few shots & then get it away before they are discovered.  So far they have only hit 2 Transports, the Arcadian & the Remembrance, two men being killed & 2 wounded on the latter, whilst one was wounded on the former.  There have been a lot of narrow escapes amongst us though. 
 Noon.  The Sudmark a German ship captured in Alexandria & belonging to the same Company as this one & now being used as a Transport is alongside of us getting water.  She has Australian Army Service Corps on board.  They were very glad to get alongside of us too as they have had nothing to smoke & very little to eat, except bully & biscuits, for a fortnight.  We however are on that ourselves, so cant do much in the eating line for them, but can appease their nicotine famine.  Suppose we will all muddle through somehow.
