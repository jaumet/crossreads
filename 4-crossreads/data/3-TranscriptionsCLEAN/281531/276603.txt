  
 10/8/18 Framerville our Band gave a programme. The first band to reach this far forward. Put in the afternoon on odds and ends & eventually met the General who told me that the 5 & 7th Bdes attack tonight and that the 24 & 23rd move forward. I move up tomorrow night & relieve in the newly captured positions. Rested the men and then got them to bomb proof their places - a wise move as we were raided later by planes. Saw two very dead Huns today near a couple of bivouacs. The flies off their wounds were getting on the bread & jam of some Billjims who were unconcernedly munching near by. Sutherland is with us tonight here and Harry Thewlis returned from his school today. Harricks is dopey.
