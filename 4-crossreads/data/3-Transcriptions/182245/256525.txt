<p>Fine, but cold. Grooming horses</p>
<p>all the morning &amp; in the afternoon</p>
<p>we had to harness up &amp; swap</p>
<p>all our black horses harness &amp;</p>
<p>everything to the 118<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery</p>
<p>for their grey horses &amp; dirty old</p>
<p>harness. We got a very bad</p>
<p>deal, but it was orders &amp; had</p>
<p>to be done. Saw an observation</p>
<p>balloon brought down in</p>
<p>flames. They are having a</p>
<p>hell of a &quot;strafe&quot; today &amp; after</p>
<p>dark the sky was just lit</p>
<p>up with flashes of guns.</p>
