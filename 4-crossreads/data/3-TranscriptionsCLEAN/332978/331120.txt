 Recd tobacco parcel today, also PC from Berlin Red Cross [indecipherable] a reply to my letter of 31/7/17. They have Sgt Wynne on Record as a Prisoner of War, & as soon as He is drafted to a camp, I will be advised. He apparently is working behind the line somewhere in France. Lt Gowing is not - recorded as a prisoner of war. I now fear the result.

 Cap Robinson & Lt Berline are in trouble. A German Cpl reported to the Commdt here that Robinson & Berline, offered him 200 to give them the Key of the front door, so as to enable them to escape; When called before the Commdt this mng they denied having done such a thing. The Commdt explained if they admitted that they said such a thing in a Joke He would overlook the matter. They still denied so the Commdt has referred them to Higher Authority. It is believed that this is being done as a reprisal because 2 German officers have just been awarded 9 mths imprisonent for a similar offence.
