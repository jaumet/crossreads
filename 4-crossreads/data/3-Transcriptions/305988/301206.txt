<p>four days, then "C" Coy relieved us &amp; we came back to a place called Stinking Farm, at the back of Messines ridge, from where we did fatigues every night up to the front line. On the 31st we were relieved by the Gloucesters &amp; came back to Neuve Eglise. Now starts the "hurry up" business.</p>
<p>April 1st we left, per motor lorry, for Meteren, on the 3rd we left Meteren at 2 a.m, marched six kilometres to Caestre, entrained there at 6 a.m, and arrived at Amiens at 10 p.m. We worked all that night, unloading our artillery, and after having breakfast, this is on the fourth, we marched eight kilometres to Allonville, arriving there at 1 o'clock. At 2 o'clock we got orders to prepare for the line. They brought motors round which took us forward to a place called Bussy-le-Daours. The 19th had jumped our claim there, so we had to march to Daours. We were just settled down nice &amp; comfortable, when, at 11 p.m, fresh movement orders came out &amp; we had to move up.</p>
