 March, 1916 Monday 6 First thing we had to sort the mob out, officers, then N.C.O's. &amp; then all the men in their various units I got another class of N.C.O's. &amp; my own gun. Several units brought Vickers guns about 6 in all. 
 Tuesday 7 Carry on the good work having a fairly good mob including a Cpl from the Royal Flying Corp. Going to the store tonight I met another one of my old Platoon now a Sergt in the present 13th Btn. We are all wearing shorts again  days very hot.
