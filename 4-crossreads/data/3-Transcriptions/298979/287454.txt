<p>reason why at least 3 times the present supply could not be issued.</p>
<p>Why do you make such a statement! says the Captain. Why! I happen to be on the Water Guard here &amp; private [dash] of my own Section is on the Water Guard at the base just a few miles away. &amp; as he accompanies the Camel train with the "phantassies" containing our water each day, he informed me the Head Quarters Staff &amp; the Company in reserve has so much water that they were able, by making holes in the sand near the tank &amp; placing a tarpaulin thereon, to have a luxurious bath &amp; to wash all their Clothes in plenty of water &amp; yet even then some was running to waste.</p>
<p>It was half an hour after this conversation that the O/C mounted his mule &amp; rode to Headquarters &amp; demanded the increase which was at once granted. The private was allowed to go to his Lines still a private but two of his section were picked out to become Lance Corporals whether they liked it or not.</p>
<p>The day after the extra supply of water was obtained the O/C had the whole Company marched down to the water tanks at the base (in two separate parties) to have a bath &amp; also to wash clothes. And such advantage was taken by the men that they washed every article even what they were then wearing &amp; as the O/C had allowed them to return to Camp in their own time they presented quite a unique sight for most of the men were only wearing a hat, a pair of boots &amp; a shirt carrying in their hands all their wet Clothes.</p>
<p>At a distance the looked "alright". Like a Company of highlanders in a summer "dress" but of course the men were returning in parties at their leisure &amp; not in any formation</p>
<p>Nothing more came of this conversation till the Company had reached Moasker on its way to Alexandria to embark for France when the O/C summoned all</p>
