<p>Fine. Travelling in the train</p>
<p>till 2pm. We got out at a place</p>
<p>called Bailleul (about 10 miles</p>
<p>from Armentiers) and went</p>
<p>out to a farm about 7 miles</p>
<p>out &amp; picketed the horses &amp; the</p>
<p>men slept in the barns. I was</p>
<p>on horse picket all night.</p>
<p>Well I dont want to spend next</p>
<p>New Years day like this. .</p>
<p>We can hear the guns going</p>
<p>all day &amp; night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aye free, aff han&#39;, your story tell</p>
<p>When wi&#39; a bosom crony;</p>
<p>But still keep something to yoursel</p>
<p>Ye scarcely tell to ony.</p>
<p>Conceal yoursel as week&#39;s Ye can</p>
<p>Frae critical dissection;</p>
<p>But keek thro&#39; ev&#39;ry othe right man</p>
<p>Wi&#39; sharpened sly inspection.</p>
