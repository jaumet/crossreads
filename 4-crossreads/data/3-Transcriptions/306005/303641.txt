<p>12-12-16<br/>Tue 12th<br/>Another enemy 'plane came over today &amp; dropped three bombs at the 3rd L. H. Bde who are camped at Malha two did no damage, the third fell on a horse &amp; killed him but fortunately it failed to explode otherwise it may have done a good deal of damage. Frost, Lindsell &amp; Browne went to some ancient Roman ruins on the Coast today to get some photos &amp; say they are well worth going to see; Last night I received orders to try &amp; get in communications with Div. Head Qrs at Mazar this morning while trying to raise them we struck a sig station who gave their call as LF, as that is the 6th Regt call I</p>
