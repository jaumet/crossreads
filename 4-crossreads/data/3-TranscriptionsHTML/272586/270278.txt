<p>My Dear Mother<br/>Your letter of the 14 feb reached me here OK I have sent several letters lately &amp; two parcels both of which I registered one contains a couple of trinkets of no value, it is addressed to BMI the other is a rawhide whip, I can spell the other word but you will know what I mean  I had a letter from Mr Allnutt also, which I was pleased to have although I don't feel like answering it, perhaps I may there is so little to write about unless one is flying round the country on every leave day &amp; sunday  this takes cash which I am glad I have not got.</p>
