<p>My dear Mrs. Bilney<br/>Please accept our sympathy with you in your loss. I know how sore your heart will be but its a grand &amp; glorious death for a brave man to die in the way in which your nephew did, of course I know that it must have been an awful shock to you &amp; his poor little wife, but I hope you will soon be able to look calmly on it.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Mrs. Simms today &ndash; She tells me you ae having very good turnouts still. I am real glad to hear it &amp; only hope they will continue, for I am very sure it will all be wanted. The war news is a little better this last few days what a pity its not all over, its been such a long weary heart breaking business.</p>
<p>We are getting very rough cold &amp; wet weather, will be very glad when it</p>
