31/8/15
A fairly good roll has made a good many sick. Beautiful blue skies and a cool breeze. Boat drill 11 am with all hands standing at stations. We need more practice in this as too many did not know where to go. Remember a funny event at Heliopolis as we were leaving. As head of column passed the Market a native woman came towards us with her head down pushing a cart of sukkar melons. As soon as she saw us she gave an agonised shriek and fled down a side street as hard as she could. Experience teaches these folk to take no risks when a tired or thirsty crowd like ours is on the march. We have a crowd of English officers aboard and some got very boozed at the bar tonight and retired helpless.
