<p>of patients here. I had sent my  <u>cable</u> or should have said I had seen the dear boy. <br/>He is doing splendidly but will take a long time to be quite well again. He was shot through his R.  <strike>chower</strike> lower cheek, splintered the jaw bone a little then it passed through to the other side  He can talk alright  &amp; is able to eat food now. The poor kiddie was awfully delighted to see me    &amp;  got a great surprise.      <br/>He is liked very much &amp; seems to be very happy. I see him every &ndash; day. He is walking about a little now. Am in a fearful hurry. Fondest love  &amp; kisses to you all  &amp; love to my friends  &amp; I am is perfect health. Hope you are all well &amp; happy.
