<p>Fine &amp; fairly warm. Well the inspection came off &amp; we put up another show. Campbell being absent made things worse. Went through the riding school in the afternoon &amp; it was on a par with most of the other things in the military&nbsp;&mdash; a farce. Got the long looked for letter from Linda with the &quot;wee confession&quot; in it. It could not have come on a better day, as I wanted something to cheer me up as I was fed up with the whole show after the exhibition we put up today. Oh Lord what wouldn&#39;t I give to be out with her for some time again. Heard that M<sup>rs</sup>&nbsp;Clyde was coming over to see Clyde when he came on leave.</p>
