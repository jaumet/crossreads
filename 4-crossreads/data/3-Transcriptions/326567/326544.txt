<p>&amp; away into the Marquis or Huts. Having received a Receipt for my Patient, I came back to Camp feeling tired &amp; turned in at 11.30 Pm &amp; slept like a Top.<br/>Tuesday 20/8/17<br/>As we had fine weather for the past day or two the Aerial work by our aeroplanes was very interesting, all day long you could hear &amp; see our Boys flying in amongst the clouds &amp; now &amp; again in the distance hear their Machine Guns fireing. After Dinner I witnessed an Aerial Fight very high up, you could see two machines skirmishing about, one would climb up high &amp; the other following &amp; you could hear the Rat Tat, Tat, of their Machine Guns, all of a sudden one dropped down turning side to side &amp; the other following &amp; then came the chase up again as they were rising along came 4 more of our Machines &amp; the one who was leading of the two climbing slewed off &amp; was lost in a big cloud</p>
