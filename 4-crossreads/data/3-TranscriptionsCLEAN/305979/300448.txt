This part of the work is rather menial and in fact one has often to sink his own wishes and to be the servant of all sorts of men  but while at work to-day I thought of One who although the Son of the Almighty, came as a minister to many and even on one occasion, as Mrs. Browning points out , washed his disciples' feet.This thought was a great consolation to me in my vocation as private in the Infantry & I thought of Ken & imagined that perhaps, after all, this saying is true, " the last shall be first".
