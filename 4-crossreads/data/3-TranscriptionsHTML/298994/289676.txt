<p>Its slush up to the eyebrows, you get it in your ears<br/>But into it, you've got to go, without a sign of fear<br/>And when you've had a bath of slush, you just set to and groom<br/>And get cleaned up for next parade, or else it's orderly room</p>
<p>Week in, week out, from morn to night, with full pack and a rifle<br/>Like Jack and Jill, you climb the hills, of course that's just a trifle<br/>"slope arms" "Fix bayonets" then "Present", they fairly put you through it<br/>And as your stagger to your hut, the Sergeant shouts, "Jump to it"!</p>
