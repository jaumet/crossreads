  
 1919 May 29 usefulness, & others have been added.  Many now famous names were pointed out to us.  We went into the Quad again in time to hear roll call.  Each master called the roll of his own particular class.  Boat racing was going on so we made our way to the river.  The river being comparatively narrow here, the boats "bump" each other instead of passing.  There was a track alongside of the river, & as soon as the race started a crowd of yelling boys tore along the track, mostly running, but a few, with megaphones, on bikes.  We were sitting on the grass not expecting this rush & had to get out of the way in a hurry.  I forgot to mention that we picked up some Canadian nurses at the    hospital  Castle & they accompanied us.  After the racing was over, we went back over the bridge & caught the train back to London. [Photograph of Eton College]
