  
 Our boys still doing well. 
 a/d H.Q. 5th F.A. Brigade A.I.F. France. 
 Field 30 August 1916 
 Dear Mrs. John, 
 Am afraid I've been some time writing you, up till just lately I've felt anyhow & simply couldn't rake up any energy at all & if I had to do something well I just used to do it & then flop on my back gracefully & gratefully directly it was finished & proceed to do absolutely nothing.  I did feel rotten & the weather was rotten & flies were rotten & everything.  However that's all over, I've been shifted back to my old beloved Brigade, not in the old Battery but in the Head Quarters this time.  And I'm Brigade clerk & promoted to Corporal & Acting Sergeant & a very important bloke so I'm doing well in my slow old way.  I didn't do any engineering either, the people here asked for me & although the D.A.C. folk didn't seem inclined to let me go well they just had to.  Thank Gawd. 
 The weather is still particularly vile & the conditions of living aren't too good still, I'm not growling at all.  We live in dugouts.
