May, 1917. Rogation Sunday. Sunday 13Day cloudy & sultry & heavy shower in morning. Up at 7 and after breakfast did drill order at 8 and no other parades for the day. Some more mail. Amused myself reading in afternoon and evening and bed late about 11. Rained during night and roof leaked and got wet a bit.
