<p>7/2/16<br/>"Tucker" Vienna, cooks fatigueman has a Rosella cardboard parrot cut out of an advertisement and has this thing nailed to a perch and a cage round it. The thing looks splendidly life-like in its Egyptian wicker prison. The same "Tucker" after our return from the trenches used to hold new reinforcements spellbound with tales of how he killed hundreds of Turks &amp; sucked their blood!</p>
<p>Early morning parade at 0630 semaphore. Morning 0830 acted as umpire in "C" Coys attack up to stage of fire fight for superiority. Afternoon 1300 "D" Coy attacked against "C" in defence covering fire signals broke down. A day in the saddle. Brigade Major &amp; Brigadier out. Our parade hours are now 0630 &ndash; 0700, 0830 &ndash; 1100, 1300 &ndash; 1530. Engineers revetting trenches we dug with hurdles and matting. Dugouts constructed of wood and sandbags proof only against shrapnel. Sand very difficult to work in having no standing power of its own. Great rumours roundabout the splitting up of each Battalion into two. Colonel Norris took over command today.</p>
<p>The camps of the remaining battalions of the brigade are all in view from here and their camel trains and so on are always across. The native camel drivers vocabulary seems limited to very few words which our fellows soon master, the stock words of the gayhouses of the Wazir pass current in the conversation. The sight of long strings of silhouetted camels against the skyline and the sea of sand all around has a fascination. The moonlight of the desert is wonderful but is surpassed by the blackness of Egyptian night. The stars seem to show doubly bright when the black Egyptian night falls, no wonder the ancient dwellers of the desert were such astronomers. The Great Bear, The North Star, and Orions belt, Mars with its red glow are all familiar.</p>
<p>All our outposts are to be relieved at 0430 before dawn in future and stand to arms as per FSRegs. At 1200 the boom of a heavy gun was heard. Aeroplane reconnoitring in front today and volplaning over the camp. Sir Archibald Murray went along our line today with a bodyguard of Bengal Lancers.</p>
