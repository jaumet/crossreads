If I return
"Ill do so so . . . if I return"
Everyday remark everyday. 
If I return and sit at last
Beside dome hearth fire safe sound
Perhaps Ill send some tales around
About our doings of the Past.
Of stairs that twist from musty lanes
Weird dens of sin with latticed doors
Fierce gasping fights in corridors
Slave market walls with rusty stains 
Peach coloured dawns with opal mists
The snaky camel train that steals
Past oxen plodding round the wheels
Gold bangles loading womens wrists
The flash of anklets thro the dust
Veiled women round the village well
(What dark eyes say no tongue may tell
Of Hate of hate, of [indecipherable]
Grey ships in rows on azure seas
Where fish like silver parrots fly
Strange lights that blink wink die 
The roll of gun fire down the breeze
Peaked islands from the sea that start
And curved white sails that dot the blue
Tired little birds of alien hue
That rest awhile and then depart
A hundred breeds of men that meet
And strive with tales in broken speech
Sad tales of homes far out of reach
Barbaric music weird sweet
