<p>Capt Stucky left here for Egypt this morning; We are enjoying nice warm weather again now; The Turks fired up some Parachute rockets (4 white 2 green &amp; one red) from "Lone Pine" &amp; the "NEK" at 4 oclock this afternoon, apparently as a signal, to some other part of their lines; but nothing followed, &amp; we cannot understand why they were fired; Squelch started cooking for CSqd today</p>
<p>3.12.15<br/>Fri 3rd<br/>Rum is now being issued daily; Today it is drizzling again, &amp; promises to be a rather cool night; We have been getting an issue of flour daily, but I manage to keep ours down by making puftaloons, &amp; scons; have been nliving well for some time, &amp; getting a double chin in consequence;</p>
