 We got word this morning that embarkation would be delayed for several days yet, but nevertheless, preparations for leaving camp were immediately begun.  Kit bags were branded, all boots were hobnailed and a hair-cut all round was ordered. 
 A pair of clippers were issued to each company and soon, the camp lines began to get very hairy.  Fair golden curls, jet black, silky locks (all allowed to flourish for the purpose of attracting the attention of the Cairo damsels) had to be parted from their proud and loving owners.  Everyone had a close crop, and we began to assume the appearance of convicts - and soldiers, real active service soldiers. 
 During the day, the men listened to short lecturettes, given by their respective platoon commanders, on subjects of great importance on an active service campaign.  Such subjects as Camp Sanitation, Duties of an Outpost, Conservation of Water, Care of Arms, were dealt with, and I think the Colonel will find that they are more profitable than is Squad Drill.
