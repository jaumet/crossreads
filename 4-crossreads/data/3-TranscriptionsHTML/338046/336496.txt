<p>1917<br/>March<br/>Westminster Abbey near the tomb of Queen Elizabeth.   An interesting circumstance connected with the Jewel Room is that Henry VI had a chapel fitted in one of the windows, and this is the place where he was praying when he was murdered by Richard.<br/>In the White Tower, so called, because 300 years or so ago, it used to be white, is a small cell where Guy Fawkes was imprisoned for 50 days before being hanged drawn, and quartered etc.   The cell is about 4 feet square and they used to chain him up as well, so the 50 days could not have passed too pleasantly.  This tower is full of armor, old guns, mortars, and rifles from the 15th century downwards.<br/>I was also shown the executioners axes and the chopping block and also the open space where the executions took place.   Another interesting feature of the Tower is a piece of an old Roman wall inside the battlements.  There were also two old birds</p>
