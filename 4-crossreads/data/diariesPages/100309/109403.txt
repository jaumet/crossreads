14/6/17 Paris

Drove back to the Opera again and visited Lloyds Bank for some change. Returned to Hotel and met Ella and we went to Les invalides.

Entering we found all the place closed as usual, but an old man had permission to take officers their friends round. However, having seen it all before, we contented ourselves with a view of all the captured trophies in the courtyard ranging from field and machine guns to aeroplanes. Returned to hotel most of the way on foot owing to the difficulty of getting taxis ? the drivers
