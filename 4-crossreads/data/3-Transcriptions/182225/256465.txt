<p>DEC.&nbsp;&nbsp; TUESDAY 12&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Cold but fine. Out exercising horses in the morning with Lieut Raymond, &amp; I cleaned my harness up in the afternoon. I went into Salisbury for tea to see mother &amp; spent the evening with her at the County Hotel. She is looking much better, &amp; is going back to London tomorrow &amp; coming on to Amesbury in a day or two.</p>
