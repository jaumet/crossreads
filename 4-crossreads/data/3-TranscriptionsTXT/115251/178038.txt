Captain Anderson,Master,S.S. "Messina",Rabaul.
Sir,It was my intention on arrival at Rabaul with the German Prisoners from Nauru, to have transferred the latter to the S.S. "Matunga" for transport to Sydney, so that your Ship might return direct to Nauru to load phosphate for the Pacific Phosphate Company, but unfortunately the "Matunga" sailed from here on the 11th instant.
As there will be no opportunity of sending the Prisoners now on board your Ship to Australia  for at least 3 weeks, and I consider it highly undesirable that they should be taken on shore here, I have to request you to put to sea at 4-0 p.m. to-day, and proceed direct to Sydney and convey the Prisoners to that Port under a Military Guard that will be placed on board.
I have the honor to be,Sir,Your obedient servant,
Colonel.Administrator.
