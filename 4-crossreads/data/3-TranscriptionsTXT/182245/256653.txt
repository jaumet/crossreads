 1917 MAY 
 18 FRIDAY 
 Fine &amp; fairly warm. Out exercising 
 horses in morning &amp; cleaning 
 harness in afternoon Fritz 
 sent a few big shells ( 
 probably 10 inch) very near 
 our waggon lines &amp; in 
 evening he came over &amp; 
 tried to get the ballon 
 practically over our heads 
 but he missed it first 
 go &amp; did not try again. I got 
 a letter from mother. 
 We had a turn out about 
 1 AM &amp; did not get back till 
 about six oclock.
