16 MONDAY
Fine all day but came on to
rain in evening. We left
Steenwerck about 9 AM &
passed through Bailleul
Strazeele & Hazebruck
& arrived at Wallen [Chapelle?]
about 3.30 pm & picketed
the horses in open. We
slept in a barn again on
straw. We see signs of
spring all along the
road but its still very cold.
