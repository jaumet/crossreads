France 12.7.18.
My Dear Mother, Time still flies on, and still there seems to be no change though there may be one at any time, we are still keeping our side up, and doing our share, and often I fancy someone else's but that does not matter, why worry, Outside there is a potato patch, that supplies the hungry soldiers with new Potatoes, they are very nice and we cook them in our trench .. perhaps the censor would consider that last bit of information as useful to the enemy, I dont,! a little further away there is a patch of peas and the pods thereon are in many cases well filled with young green peas, a luxury not to be missed by soldiers, who have for so long been told "Thou shall not Salvage the Frenchmans Spuds, when he is not looking, or his peas at any time,"
You see now we are in the evacuated area, and some of these crops must be saved, we are saving the spuds. some of the wheat oats etc may be saved later on. I hope so anyway dont be surprised at some later date
