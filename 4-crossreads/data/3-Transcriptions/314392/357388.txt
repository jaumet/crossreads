<p>near Amiens for a spell. Weather is fine and we are taking things easy.<br/>Sept 12th Left Longeau for line and say it is much further away now than what it was where we pulled out for we went through many villages before we reached our ultimate destination at Vraegnes. At Bouverecourt we had a funny experience - we pulled in for the night to an old dump that had been used by the Yarlies. We had all been warned about traps and mines and were all on the "qui vive".<br/>One chap went looking for a decent dug out</p>
