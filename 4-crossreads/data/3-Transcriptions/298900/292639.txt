The object of the lecture was to explain the food question to troops, so as to dispel any doubts &amp; fears as to whether the people at home were suffering from want or were likely to be.   It appears that British troops have been much perturbed over the subject &amp; the Government have sent out lecturers with the idea of explaining things &amp; so improving their morale.    Dr Cameron of Glasgow was the lecturer &amp; he gave a pretty graphic description of what has been done &amp; is to be done to grapple with the subject.   Much of it was familiar but certain figures he gave were new.   Causes of deficiency of food caused by (1) France have a shortage of 50% (2) &amp; Italy 1/5 &amp; (3) sinkings by U Boats.   Since Feb 1917 we had 1302</p>
