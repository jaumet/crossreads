<p>III<br/>I suppose &amp; Sis will be leaving for England if they stick to the original programme. At present I do not see that I have much chance of falling in with them. Hope their venture is going to turn out well.<br/>I have not seen anything of Rex Robert or Olding for some time. They are in a different part of the country from where I am, but the last I heard was they were all well.<br/>No more news at present. Mum's letter which you mentioned has not turned up yet so I will wait a day or so before writing her to see if it comes along. With fondest love to yourself Mother &amp; Pat<br/>I am, Your affectat Son<br/>Terence<br/>P.S. Struan Robertson was over to see me last night. He has had a pretty rough time but is O.K. Asks to be remembered to you all TWG</p>
