<p>JUNE &nbsp; MONDAY 5 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>It came up very windy and a roughish sea. We left Durban at 8 AM and after dropping the pilot turned south. They say we call in at Capetown &nbsp;anyway I hope we do. There were a few girls down to see us off but not many &nbsp;It got very windy &amp; some fair waves towards afternoon &nbsp;One broke the bridge in bow of the ship and washed the big rope down. Not many sick but a few went out to it. It was pretty choppy about mid-day, the bridge in front of the ship got broken again in evening &nbsp;We can see lava most of way round I hear.</p>
