10th. After a very pleasant journey through the Mediterranean we arrived at Port Said at 3 p.m. this afternoon immediately began to coal.
The "Karagola" about one hour ahead of us.
11th. All day coaling at Port Said where we have held aquatic sports.
This evening at 6 p.m. we moved are now in the Canal, with "Karagola" some two miles astern.
Port Said is not very impressive deriving its importance solely from the fact that is the N. Canal terminus.
