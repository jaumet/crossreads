Pal of Mine ? continued
A rough hewn bit of limestone on the spot where Ginger lies
Bears a proper soldiers tribute ? "a brave man never dies"
 I hear the sentnel saying when the judgment story's told
All's Well Pass little comrade to your dugout made of gold
Where the wailing croon of Shrapnel plays a requiem o?er you head
In the slime of muddy Flanders where the bravest's fought bled
I'll go looking for you Ginger when I've crossed lifes firing line
 wether hell or heaven may I meet you Pal o mine.
