<p>November 7</p>
<p>pain is hidden.</p>
<p>Snowy was one of the Pozieres reinforcements, and his nature was great:  always his manner was charming, and he'll be missed as Dick Seymour, Ernie Brown, Paddy, and Norm Reed and the others.  "Requiescat in Pace."  And Heinz, always by himself, satisfied compleately to remain unnoticed, but always friendly and good natured.  He joined us at Factory Corner last January&hellip; Leask and Ray and Dick Hagger joined with him&hellip;all are out of the Ambulance&hellip; two killed in action, Leask at Bullecourt, and two P.B. .. Requiescat.  (Hagger rejoined Boss St. Julien.)</p>
<p>This afternoon with Frank D. down to the M.D.S. for mail, issued there with gloves, cardigans and cap comforters.  No mail.</p>
<p>By the side of the orderly room rested four crosses and a six-pointed star, in the graves of the men killed in the second part of this stunting.</p>
<p>Early this morning came the word of the capture of 3000 Boche by the Canadians, a 5.9 battery and Passchendaele villiage.</p>
<p>November 7, 8<br/>Night Duty:  not a single cloud in a cold starr'd sky.</p>
<p>One of the 2nd Field drivers in the dugout tonight just before coming on duty- I called "digger"!  He turned around with, "I'm not a digger &ndash; I'm in the Orderley Room!"  I've just finished making a sketch of it, and will send it along to the Anzac Bulletin.  The drawing of Digger is not bad &ndash; neither is the Box Hut background, but the "I say Digger" is rather clumsily crowded on to the addressed&hellip;however.  Finished, to post tomorrow letters of Oct. 28, 30, 31, Nov. 2 &amp; 7 enclosing Aunt Louie's letter of Pool at Devonshire Lane drawing and Stuart's reply from the Bulletin.</p>
<p>112.  November 8<br/>5 a.m.  To midnight quiet and no planes over:  then the moon rose.  Bombing's been mostly across over the Vlamerhinge road and rail.  Scattered vague shelling hereabouts:  so far no casualties.  A half hour ago the guns started a high chorusing, but are now easing off. .. There'll have been Hell's Delight by the newly captured part of the Passchendaele Ridge and villiage since midnight &ndash; from aerial torpedos &amp; bombs.  The holding will be worse than the taking.</p>
