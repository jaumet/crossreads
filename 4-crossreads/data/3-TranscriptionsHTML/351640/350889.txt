<p>Russians be smashed by German Bill, 'twill go hard with our armies in the north of France during the coming months of the summer.   Many of the English soldiers coming here are mere boys, some look as if with Mother is the place for them, I had to tell one laddie that to day, I was sorry for him but he was so upset at nothing.<br/>The photograph and the Tidy arrived from Buddie, she was thoughtful to send them, the photo is now beside me.   I often in the day take your pictures from my pocket and have a chat with the faces.   Thanks for the prayers my dear, I am sure that they are effective on my behalf   You have seen Dr. Kennedy long ere this, I hope that he was stronger on his arrival in Sydney, he looked wretched when leaving Mena.</p>
<p>Kitty dear:   I judge from the context that your letter was written some time in the middle of May.   Dear M. M. Bertrand is worried about me, please thank her for taking so much interest in me and my doings, she is a dear old girl, who has always been kind to me, and to you four girls.   You will need to be your own doctors soon, surely none more will be taken from your side of the world, there are enough of us here at the present moment.  The boys from the fifth field ambulance seem to be great friends to you, if they come my way I shall ask for personal news of all.  You must have been a great help to Mrs Parsons on Belgian day.</p>
<p>This morning at Mass I looked out for Major Norris but I saw no one known to me.</p>
