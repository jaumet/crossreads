He has been with his battery in the severest affairs of this war &amp; at last an unfortunate shell fell where he was standing last Friday week 5th inst. a piece caught him across the upper thigh &amp; lower abdomen &amp; though he lived in hospital till next day, it was too severe &amp; he died.  I will endeavour to send you a small &amp; very rough sketch of the spot &ndash; an annex to the French Cemetery at Warloy, where he lies.  He with two others killed by the same shell are buried together &amp; one fine painted wooden cross marks the graves.  They are surrounded by white posts which are joined by fine black chains.</p>

But should I not be able to later on. If you write to the following address you will, I'm assured receive every courtesy in reply.<br/>"The Cure"<br/>Warloy, Baillon<br/>Somme,<br/>France<br/>I interviewed the Cure myself &amp; he assured me nothing could be done at present, but after the war, he or his successors would be happy to do anything they can for you.  I ascertained that Terence's personal effects are being sent on to you.<br/>It was a great shock to me Uncle, especially as within a day or so I had got within</p>
