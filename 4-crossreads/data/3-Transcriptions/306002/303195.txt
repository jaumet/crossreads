<p>18.6.15<br/>Friday 18th.  While we were having breakfast this morning shrapnel began to fall too handy to be comfortable, two of our men &amp; several Queenslanders being hit.  At 8 oclock I had to take a sapping party to the Supply Depot, we were working till 10 o'clock &amp; then a Jack Johnson fell within a yard of a heap of boxes packed 10 ft. high.  It made a very large hole &amp; a few of the boxes fell off the top &amp; cheeses were rolling in all directions, we were covered in dirt from it, but no one hurt.  A few minutes later another fell a few yards further away from us &amp; the Engineering Officer told us to get away till the shelling ceased, we got away alright &amp; did not go near them again so we got off with only two hours work to-day.  No jam again to-day we have only had one tin of jam between the 3 of us during the last 5 days.  Warships busy at times to-day.</p>
