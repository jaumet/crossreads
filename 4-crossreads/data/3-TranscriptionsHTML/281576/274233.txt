I got my picture taken &amp; they promised to send them on in 3 weeks time.  20 Fs for a dozen.  Snowy Atherton, Nigger Bowden, Bluey Stanton &amp; Bricky Mason  were with me.  We visited the Cathedral &amp; spent some time viewing the wonderful carvings.  Most of the best work is covered by sandbags.  The weeping Angel is a very fine piece of work.  It is a copy of the original in Rheims Cathedral, which was destroyed.</p>
