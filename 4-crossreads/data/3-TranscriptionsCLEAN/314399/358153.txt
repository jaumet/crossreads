Thursday 5 June 1919Garage all day. Bill came home with me & we went to Marie's for tea. Stayed there till 9. Came home & wrote & read. Also did a bit of packing.
Friday 6 June 1919Packed. Squared up. Took my trunk & valise to Pritchard Place. Went to Horseferry Rd for 1/2 fare vouchers. Got 3rd class voucher & ticket. The old lady gave me a sponge cake for the train. Went early to the train & got a corner seat. Had 2 naval boys & 3 ladies in the compartment. Wasn't comfy tho. Thought I'd be found out. Wasn't tho & arrived Glasgow OK.
