 Monday March 31.1919.  141A fine day. There was a kit inspection this afternoon by an officer for all men in this company on the roll of the Shropshire. We were also removed to Huts 10 and 13, for Revellie is at 4 O'Clock and we are to catch the boat train for Avenport near Bristol where the Shropshire is berthed. The train leave Weymouth about a quarter to 8. [Shorthand transcribed as follows]  I wrote a short letter to my wife this evening, letter 165.  [end of shorthand] I was at a picture show in the Gym. tonight with Sargeant Hammett but it was a tame affair & we did not stay for the finish but went to the N.A.C.B. canteen and had a feed.
