 Very hot all day &ndash; Went for a route march &ndash; across the desert a bit. 
 Went into Cairo at night &amp; met two fellows from Enoggera &ndash; fly flats &ndash; they were going to show us Cairo, which they did with a vengeance, we finished up lost in a blind alley &amp; in a very poor delapidated quarter. All soldiers have to be out of Cairo by 9-15 pm &ndash; this made us late &ndash; so much so that we had to take tram out to Helliopolis &amp; walk across the sand &ndash; got home by 10 pm.
