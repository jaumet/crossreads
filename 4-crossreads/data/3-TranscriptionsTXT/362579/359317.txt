 two Sisters who got the R.R.R. of the old C.C.S.    we were attached .  We (Dot   &amp;  I) got back in time to go on duty at 10 p.m. Had a great dinner   &amp;  it was very jolly, though a    Hen affair  . 
 Shall write a longer letter when I receive any from home. It is a beastly night &ndash; lightening   &amp;  thunder. 
 Must stop now. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all 
 XO  From   XX X Yours lovingly O Edith XOXOXOXOX
