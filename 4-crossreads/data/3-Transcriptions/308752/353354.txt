<p>July 26th 1916.<br/>A very quiet day, slept nearly all morning.  A number of men killed during the night in the different battalions.  No casualties in the battalion that our party is attached to.</p>
<p>July 27th.<br/>A terrible roar of guns all through the night, but luckily no casualties. My fourth parcel arrived from home. It came just at the right moment. All the boys in the dug-out appreciated the contents. The towel, soap &amp; handkerchiefs I wanted badly as I have been out here for 5 days without a decent wash. We had 1 towel amongst 3 men &amp; it was almost as black as the ace of spades.</p>
<p>July 28th.<br/>A beautiful day it is cruel to think that men are trying to kill each other amidst all natures beauty. The blue sky &amp; all the country looking at its best. For the last two hours I have been sitting at the door of our dug-out watching our British Aeroplanes dodging about. Some of the Airman are very daring &amp; fly right over the German lines. They are being continually bombarded from enemies guns &amp; many of them have very narrow escapes. It is very exciting to watch these planes manouvreing amidst shot &amp; shell but it would be terrible sight to see one brought down. This is our 8th day in the Angels Dug-out, &amp; our packs have not arrived yet, no chance for a change of under-clothes. At 2 a.m. this morning we were awakened by the guard for a gas alarm. But thank God it did not prove to be true. We all wore our Gas Helmets for about 15 minutes. I am told that a few sniffs of this poisonous gas will kill &amp; man. 7 p.m. 8 British Aeroplanes have just flow over the German lines, it was a wonderful sight. They were being continually bombarded, but they managed to escape disaster, as far as we could see.</p>
