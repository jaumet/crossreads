 JULY &nbsp; MONDAY 31 &nbsp; 1916 
 Fine &amp; hot. We had some battery standing gun drill in morning, with coats representing the different stations. The headquarters were signalling all day with flags &amp; heliograph. I had a wire from Mother to say she was coming down to Salisbury today. 
 The 27 th &nbsp;Battery went on duty at Six oclock tonight, but as luck would have it I did not get on any duty.
