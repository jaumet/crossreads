<p>Thursday 13.1.16 (22)<br/>We had no High Jinks today. The Colonel would not allow it. We had to be content with seeing Neptune confided to the deep with muffled drums &amp; the "Last Post" on the bugles at 7 pm.</p>
<p>I have not had any special duty to do for about 3 or 4 days. I suppose I will cop out to-morrow. We had a lecture this afternoon &amp; I could not keep awake. I was sitting right in front &amp; went to sleep twice &amp; Ellis had to wake me up.</p>
<p>Had first lesson at Roller-Bandaging last night. I am learning every thing</p>
