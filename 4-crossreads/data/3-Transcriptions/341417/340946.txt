<p>fighting very soon. It seems a shame that the Huns have pushed us back (I don't mean the Australians) for we fought very hard since we have been in France for the country Fritz has taken off us now, but at the same time we have not been defeated, for as the Huns did not get their objective (Amiens &amp; Hazebrouck) they have come a terrible thud.</p>
<p>When we left the some [Somme] for were we are now we met Fritz in fact run into him and after the first bit of a scrap he got the shock of his life to find the Ack I F (AIF) opposing him and it was finish advance for him. The French cannot say enough for us and they praise us up as we have never been praised before.</p>
