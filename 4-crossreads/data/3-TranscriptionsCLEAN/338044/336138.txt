 Last night we had tea with Madame Alice &  the girls &  some music    &  entertainment afterwards. It was indeed a pleasant change. 
 Dec 27th Monday Again night duty from 12 midnight to 7 am. As the weather is very cold it is not only unpleasant but miserable trying to work all night wrapped up in our greatcoats. 
 Dec 28th to Dec 30th Plenty of work & no amusement. Nothing but sleep & work so not very interesting.
