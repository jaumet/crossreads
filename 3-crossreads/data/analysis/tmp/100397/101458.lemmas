 I may be here for a coupl of month and I may be here for 12 . I dont think that I will though , not if I can help it . I cannot tell you anyth about the town we are in camp a coupl of mile out and so far I have seen veri littl of the town as it was late when we arriv there and we were just shove into car and rush off to this place . Tonight I think we will be take a walk in there this even to have a look round . There perhap I will be abl to find someth to write about at present all I know is that we can see the ocean out at the back there from the hill we can get anoth glimps of it from out in front so I guess this place is on a sort of peninsula . I was sorri to leav Stoke as I was veri comfort there , and I like the sister . I did not get an opportun to go over the Stoke and Hanley potteri I would like to have seen them befor I left
