Tuesday afternoonSept 15  - 1914We are face to face this aft with a terrible tragedy - the loss of AE1 & all her crew - 3 fine officers - Besant - Scarlett & Moore & 27 Stokers  -  What happened we don't know  -  The Submarines were to patrol turn & turn about & about at 7 am yesterday morning AE1 went out  -  Scarlett was forward on the tiny bridge  -  Besant was aft  -  I saw them go out  =  They patrolled along with the Destroyer - Parramatta  -  All went as per usual, nothing to be seen, all well  -  The Destroyer last saw AE1 about 2-30 pm in St George channel  -  Both were returning  -  The Destroyer went to Herbertshoe (note correct spelling) & naturally concluded AE1 came up harbor to us  -  She was due about 7 pm  -  We had dinner & told the stewards to keep things hot for them  -  About 8 pm inquiries began to be made & Stoker was sent for to the flag ship  -  A wireless went out to the Parramatta & she told all she knew  -  Anxiety deepened but we knew that 30 picked men - as good men as any in the fleet - all volunteers - might have had some break down or what not  -  At 12 we all turned in  -  At day light we were up but there was no news  -  The destroyers - 3 in number - had been out all night sweeping the seas with their search lights & now it is 3 pm & not a word has been
