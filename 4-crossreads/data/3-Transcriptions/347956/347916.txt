<p>as being out of action; I believe the advance guard of the 3rd Contingent arrived here this afternoon, had a sore throat from arguing the point when I went to sleep at 9 oclock</p>
<p>Wed 10th<br/>Woke this morning feeling rather well &amp; have been on light duties;  C Sqd has gone out to the range again for musketry &amp; I put a good part of the morning in washing up  The Sq. signallers did not go to the range; Were supposed to be paid to-day but it was postponed; the dust has been horrible today &amp; I retired to bed early</p>
