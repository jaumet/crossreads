place, and I will be satisfied if I am brought back to it one of these days.
25/10/17.
We are getting on with our railway. Fritz still objects strongly and tears up whole lengths of it. A big squadron of "Gothas" escorted by fighting machines came over this morning and keyed us up with bombs. This form of attack takes some getting used to and when I hear the engines of a "Gotha", I expierence that sensation known as "wind-up." They come nearly every night and bomb all round our camp. They hit it the night before last and a lot of chaps were killed. Went to work very early this morning so dodged the most of the daily "strafe". Went to the D.A.C. lines and ate Arch Mc out of house and home again.
