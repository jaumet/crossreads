  
 April, 20 74.  1 a.m. Quiet, but for planes over, all [at ?] supper sudden pause for close listening, then more Moet. 
 To rejoin our section this morning:  whether this means going back to reserve, or to the new A.D.S., no-one knows. 
 Caestre, New A.D.S. 
 75. Arrived here about 2 p.m., in time for an hour's shelling, the same sensitive shells of Borre - of terrific explosion, and velocity.  Les, Buck and self to the joint cellar, before leaving, and a bringing back of about 24 bottles of Moet and Leon Chandon, and after tea here, I to the Church in the village, there in the Cure's garden a grouting of a great bundle of spring onions.  Out again, a finding of a great champagne dump - of Carte d'Or and a dozen other brands, and Prunellas and Liquers.  So an orgie of a minor character. 
 A. on Night Duty, self with Dresser of Walking Wounded.  Narnsby and self just back from the village proper, after a grouting of three chickens from a ruined wrecked farmhouse, for breakfast tomorrow morning.  While in the hen-house the second barrage of the evening over.  Champagne, Carte D'Or and Prunella a most delightful cocktail. 
 Mail today, a parcel from Mother - sox & shaving soap and ordinary, and a note, 
 "Did I ever tell you Angus and Robertson's rang up and asked your address, as you had ordered some books:  well I told them not to send them, as you had applied to come home, but now I'll go in and tell them to send them on." 
 So there's the possibility of an early receiving of Adams' Plays and some other decent Australian stuff.  And from the Commonwealth Bank a notification of money being received. 
 Posted to Beaumonts order of 4/6 for "Oracle of Colour" and J. Freeman's new Morland Press book.  Also a letter written to Commonwealth Bank. 
 April 21 76.  10.20 p.m. Last night by the line of the Gods moderately quiet, early a terrible opening up of our guns.  We have heard nothing of its meaning.
