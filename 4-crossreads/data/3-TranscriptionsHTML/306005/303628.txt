<p>2-12-16<br/>Sat 2nd<br/>At 8.30 this morning a dozen Australian belonging to the Camel Corps passed this camp escorting one Bedouin on a camel &amp; several on foot, making for Head Qrs at Mazar. This morning I sent Les Olson <strike>to bring out</strike> to Mazar to bring along 8 miles of wire &amp; a bundle of flag poles sent on by train, he arrived back with the poles but said there is no wire there, so that means a trip for me tomorrow. Lt. Garbett &amp; Maj. Irwin went out today (East) &amp; were within 12 miles of El Arish &amp; could see the spire in El Arish. A Turkish <strike>Outpost</strike> patrol went within half a mile of them &amp; quite close to one of our Outposts who have received orders not to fire on them, we believe there are about 8,000</p>
