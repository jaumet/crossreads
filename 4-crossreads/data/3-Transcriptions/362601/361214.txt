<p>1700 letters up till leaving England.</p>
<p>4 June, Wednesday</p>
<p>F.<br/>Lovely day &amp; a little ground swell. We stop to take in Mine-destoyers. We have an inspection like a sea-serpent. Boat drill but I don't go on. We are very busy upstairs. I come downstairs very tired &amp; go straight to bed.</p>
<p>5 June, Thursday</p>
<p>F.<br/>Sea choppy but we make good headway with sea behind us. Pass 2 ships about 10 am, my afternoon off. I go below to read &amp; write. I develop awful headache &amp; nothing will relieve it so I go to bed all afternoon &amp; evening.</p>
