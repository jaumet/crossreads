APRIL 1917
19 THURSDAY
Fine, but dull & cloudy all
day. Cleaning harness ect in
morning & at dinner time
we were told we were moving
again. We packed up & moved
off from Quesques about 3 pm
& went about six kilometers
on through Selles to a place
called Brunembert where we
picketed our horses under
cover in an old brick kiln
Its not a bad joint but not
as good as some I have been
in. I was on picket at
night.
