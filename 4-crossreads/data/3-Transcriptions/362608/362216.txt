<p>I must say it came as an awful shock to us as we were quite sure we would be able to get away. So my dear people I ask you with all my heart not to worry and we shall come home to you all as soon as possible. God knows we have been parted many lonely months but happy days will soon come. Mother dear I ask you to comfort my little girlie and comfort her till I come home. Now I shall say au revoir with fondest love to all at home, and God bless you all bye bye till next week<br/>Believe me<br/>Your loving Son and Brother<br/> Ellis</p>
