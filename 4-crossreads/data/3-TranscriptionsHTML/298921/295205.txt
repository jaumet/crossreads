<p>August, 1915<br/>Sunday 22<br/>I have tried to keep going in a normal way &amp; forget the scenes &amp; mates I have lost &ndash; It would not do to brood there is much to be done yet.<br/>I can hear Church being held &ndash;<br/>This is funny Wm Gunners son from Walgett sent an admission card to my old camp for me to come &amp; see him, he is in the 6 L.H. wounded &amp; in next corridor but did not know I also was wounded &amp; in the same Hospital.</p>
