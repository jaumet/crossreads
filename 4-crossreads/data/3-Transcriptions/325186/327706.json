<p>Nieppe for one night. From Nieppe we went to De-Seule camp for three days then off we went again to Erquinghem  We billeted in an old factory that had been used as baths for the troops. The 33rd &ndash; 35th &amp; 36th went into the line at Armentiers but the 34th were in support of them &amp; we were out every night putting up wire. We were in these billets for Xmas and had a pretty good Xmas dinner. There was plenty of snow and ice about at this time  After doing these wiring parties for ten days we went back to De-Suele Camp for one night and from there we moved out to Meteren on 2nd January 1918  At Meteren we had about the best billets that we had been in up</p>
