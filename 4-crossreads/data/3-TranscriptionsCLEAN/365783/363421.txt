Both these gems are for you - also the brass replica of Cleopatra's needle which I purchased in the Mouski the main street in the bazaar district of Cairo.   There are also two cushion covers one for each of the girlies, a small brass tray for Trix and a native head wrapper for Amy.   There are also for the children beads galore collections of stamps & coins & a piece of the Xmas cake from the Kyarra.I think it would be just as well to sterilize the whole darned lot - boiling wouldn't hurt any of the precious things.   I also sent a book of Luxor views & copies of the first half dozen photos I took with the new camera.I will be sending more photos probably by next mail.  I rarely see Fred he is the man what does the disinfecting, he looks much cleaner since he has been on this job - perhaps he occasionally goes through the disinfecter himself.   He is also very fat & comfortable looking - too much manual labour I fear is his trouble.   And now I must end up with heaps & heaps of love to all the dear ones & not a little to your own dear selfYr Loving husbandWill.PS.  Many happy returns of the 10th for Peter.   God Bless him.  W.H.R.
