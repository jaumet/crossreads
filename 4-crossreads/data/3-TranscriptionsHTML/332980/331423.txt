<p>After a Chat for an half an hour I left &amp; took a walk through the Shunting Yards, through Les Fontinettes &amp; followed the main line right around to Calais Ville so as to get a good insight to all the Signals &amp; points enroute, then back home again at the usual time. I continued going backwards &amp; forwards until Friday 19th when on Saturday I broke my journey at Audruicq &amp; paid by chum a visit &amp; had Dinner with him &amp; spent the Afternoon visiting friends in the Camp &amp; after Tea my chum took me for a stroll out to visit some French People about 1&frac12; miles away, after a chat with his friends we went along a Canal to the Locks where a large number of Barges were being brought down containing Wounded Horses, at these locks the Barges are lowerd down about 4 ft, before the Gates of the lock are opened a slide at the bottom is drawn up &amp; the Water rushes in &amp; fills the Basin up to the level of the Water behind &amp; then the Gates are opened &amp; in goes a Barge drawn by two Horses when the Gates are closed <strike>&amp; are opened at the other</p>
