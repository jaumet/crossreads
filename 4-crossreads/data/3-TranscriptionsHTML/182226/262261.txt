<p>Saturday 28 August, 1915</p>
<p>We are holding &quot;Courtneys Post&quot; near the extreme right of the Australian position. There are Turkish trenches on every side of us. It makes you a bit shaky for a while to hear bullets thudding into the sandbags a couple of feet from your head or shells shrieking over the hill into Popes Post 200 yards away.</p>
<p>The Indians out here are very cool customers. It is&nbsp;great see them plodding along with the mules taking no more notice of the bullets than if they were flies.</p>
<p>This place is a regular network of trenches, you could easily lose yourself in them. They are 8 feet deep in the front line &amp; they need to be for they are being fired into day &amp; night.</p>
<p>Had a swim at Hell Spit this afternoon. Expected to be shelled any minute but was determined to have a dip.</p>
