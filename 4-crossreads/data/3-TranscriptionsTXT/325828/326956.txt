 a day's sickness since I've been in France. The weather here has been very variable.  We are still getting a good deal of wet sloppy stuff &amp; I think sometimes it is far preferable to the thick clouds of dust &amp; muck we are at present experiencing. I saw Wal for about 10 minutes about a fortnight ago for about &frac12; an hour &amp; he was looking very well &amp; said he felt tip-top.  I have been very anxious about him since his company has been in Action the last 3 days &amp; can find out nothing, so must hope that no news is good news, as he has made arrangements that Rid &amp; I should be advised at once if he gets knocked or wounded. In case you should not receive letters from me for some time I will always  send  endeavour to send a Field Service Card to let you know I am O.K.  There is some talk about blocking us from writing any more  letters  from the line here &amp; if that the rumour is true we will only be allowed to send the F.S. Card. I trust you are all keeping well, &amp; that Ol has practically settled down again now.
