26/1/16Course almost due W so any chance of going other than towards Aden seems improbable. Put on fatigue work today & expected in fact the sergeant thought I was, cleaning out the scuppers & drains, washhouses & the showers etc. His mistake because Hop & I were up in our old place near the spuds. Hooper & Dad Perry get 7 day's fatigue for pinching ashore at Colombo - lucky. Eric swears that  if ever his children play at soldiers he will crack them with a shovel, before they get any silly ideas. Dad Perry & Gertie Hooper get 7 days fatigue for staying ashore all night at Colombo.
27/1/16Gertie Hooper goes on sick parade  to avoid fatigue. Dad scrubs the tables. Since leaving Colombo the canteen prices have risen considerably. Little limes, a fruit as big as a walnut & like a very small lemon, were bought in Colombo for 1/3 per hundred. At the canteen they cost sixpence per dozen - good profit.
