<p>7/9/15 Ian Hamilton's despatch before first landing headed "Soldiers of France &amp; of the King!" Attack ordered "on a position vaunted by the enemy as impregnable"</p>
<p>Great expression here is "dinkum oil". People in trenches wanting to ascertain facts send down to Battn H.Q. and ask "Is there any "dinkum oil" today?"  A good many shells alround but not much damage. <br/>I slept all day. Bed 9.30.</p>
<p><u>8/9/15</u> Up 4am. Cold. 6th moving out Back to bed at 5 and slept till 8. Lovely day, sunny and perfect view from rear of trenches over the sea. The fleet there lying peacefully at anchor. Some shrapnel bursting pretty close. A fairly quiet day. 6th moved out and I took over administration here. Very busy with orders. Bde HQ arrived &amp; commenced to organise. General Walker in &amp; Col. Forsyth later. Made arrangements to sandbag up corpses before wet weather starts washaways. Several boots sticking out of side of hill, attached to dead mens feet. Our chaps take boots off &amp; wear them themselves if they are a good pair. Unfortunately in pulling them off they often get the foot too! Arranged to tuck all these in &amp; sandbag them up. Bed <strike>19</strike>  2100 &ndash; not in trenches today. Plenty of bullets passing over</p>
