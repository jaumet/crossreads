<p>4.  there may be chance to get them later on.<br/><u>Pension York</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received quite an enthusiastic welcome back here and a little after arrival had a telegram from Rid at Tel-el-Keber just saying "Splendid.  Love;" it was to relieve my mind about the conditions there for I know how horrid some of the officers were to him at first in the Hospital &amp; how keen some O.Cs are to show the Chaplains they are not wanted.  It seems to be all right though the telegram was quite a surprise.<br/>I sent the cable to you to-day that we made up in Wal's tent yesterday.<br/>Must close this now dear People.  Very much love to you all, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your loving daughter<br/>Olive.<br/>P.S.  Please Father will you take a note of the fact that Wal paid me back &amp;pound5 last week; I don't want it but he wanted to get rid of it evidently.  O.L.O.</p>
