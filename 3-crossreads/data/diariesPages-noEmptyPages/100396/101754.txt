tomorrow is a holiday but I will not be able to take advantage of it it's a great pity as I have about 200 PT to bust up. I don't want any of this wretched money on my hands when we leave here I think it would be very hard to pass in any other part of the world. I am sending a booklet of photos supposed to be you won't be able to make out anything of them I paid 6 P.T. for it in a rather dim light am not pleased with it. I must close now with love to all keeping plenty for yourself
from your loving son

Am sorry I have become so popular most of us feel like idiots for being here at all, however things may liven up when we get to the firing line.
