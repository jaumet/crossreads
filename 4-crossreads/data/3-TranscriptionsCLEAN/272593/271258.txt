  
 Len went round to the aeroplane school yesterday all N.C.O.s from Corporals up have to attend now I believe & quite right for it is a fine thing to know about. Yesterday afternoon the result of a Court Martial of one of our Sergts for drunkeness was read out, the way they do these things is like this   the whole Battalion are formed up on three sides, then the offender is marched in & his crime, & verdict is read out by the C.O. in this case the Sergt was reduced to a Corporal   they do this on the ground, the Drum Major steps forward & with a sharp pair of scissors or knife cuts a stripe off in front of all the men   the prisoner is then marched off the ground & the parade dismisses but what a fool a man looks
