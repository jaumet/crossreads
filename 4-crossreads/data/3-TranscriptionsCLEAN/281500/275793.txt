that I thought I would put it in here "Imbros"Oh misty isle of ImbrosEncircled by blue seasArched over by an azure skyOn thee a weary man might lieO Gentle Isle of ImbrosA man might take his ease.
Oh misty Isle of ImbrosWe look across the blue Sick men who have not ease not restTurn wearily towards the westOh sunset isle of ImbrosWe turn and look to you.
Oh misty isle of ImbrosWe know that we must stayFor us, for us is no releaseSave only death or wounds or peaceOh phantom isle of ImbrosA thousand miles away."Anzac"
