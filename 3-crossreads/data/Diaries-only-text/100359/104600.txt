Thursday 31st
Rain cleared and a fine sunshiny day, but plenty of clouds still hanging around. This being the last day of the month the question on everybody's lips is "are we going to be paid" Good news in the paper. Roumania is giving Austria some "hurry up" so surely will soon end now. The Sanitary Police are busy paving the yard with old tins, which will make it nice and sloppy during the wet weather.
Friday September 1st
Building new Latrines. Pay day. Drew 20 f. Plenty of aeroplanes buzzing around, so Fritz is being kept on the move. Bill "Lanc" and a number of our big fellows are doing Police Work in the town. Things very quiet.
 
Saturday 2nd
Added a little more to my "weekly" epistle to M.S. Finished the Latrines. After tea we adjourned to "The dive" but found it occupied by a mob of clearing hospital fellows whose language and general behaviour was very unbecoming so we "cleared out" and went to some place in the main street. There was a Piano and Frank Newton soon had the ball rolling. Tommy Ross and Nick Coxon obliged with songs, as also did Bob Roberts an Artillery chap was there making a nuisance of himself . "Trev" our "Roan Colt" got up and was rendering "the Wattle around the Litchenburg" in his best manner. Our Artill. Friend again interjected and on Coxon remonstrating he became very abusive and talked fight. In the end Nick cracked him a beauty in the eye, and our evening's amusement came to rather an abrupt termination.
Sunday 3rd
20 battle-planes flew over this morning, so something must be doing and the big guns are banging away merrily. Finished my weekly letter to L.A. also wrote Mother.
Monday 4th
Making fire buckets and paving the yard with empty tins. Raining like fun. Yesterday
