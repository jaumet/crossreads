However, for some reason, none chose to fall amongst our small group, and after about half an hour it died down.  We all felt relieved, and kept a sharp look out, but Fritz did not follow up.  On reporting "all correct"  to the 2nd Battalion on our right later on, we learnt that they had suffered some casualties.  There were some nasty wounds and a few deaths, but the outpost occupied by the 3rd Btn, were very lucky.

One pair two [took] an hour and a half to go about 3 hundred yards.  It sounds incredible, but it is a fact.  They sank each step above the knees in the dreadful mud.  Be it said to
