Dear Sir,
I am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd Sept. & I will gladly give you the particulars you ask for:No. 6119 Pvte. Warren Hutchings1st Field Ambulance1st Aust. DivisionA.A.M.C. A.I.E.F.
I have other splendid letters written by the same person but they contain "personal touches". So I wrote & asked him to write me a letter minus any "personal touches" & I would give it to The Mitchell Library. This he did & sent the letter to England to be posted, & now you have it.
I amYours TrulyDorothy Sawell.
