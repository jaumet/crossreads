<p>of  Sir Harry Rawson, you will remember him, Governor of NSW a few years back; and we had quite a long chat about Australia, She says Sir Harry is never tired of talking of the Australians, and the good time he spent there.  I am sending a little group on a couple of cards we had taken a few days ago, a couple of ladies, or rather four, gave us a strawberry tea, and we were snapped in the act. They are quite decent people, live in the town, their only brother is at present acting under the name of George Rosebury at one of the Melbourne theatres. The other boy in the photo is a chap called Hays, from Victoria, he is a jolly decent fellow, and we mostly knock about together.  I have had several other photos taken, and will send them along as soon as I get them.</p>
<p>Best love to all at home,<br/>With fondest love from,<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Gordon</p>
