<p>Aug 30 friends were preparing to entertain us. And now they <u>are</u> doing it in right royal style, after providing a ripping spread. It's one of the best Concerts ive had the pleasure of seeing. Singing, dancing, piano &ndash; selections, &amp; you bet the boys enjoyed it. Talk about cheer &ndash; they nearly cheered the roof off, and the chap in charge (the boss cocky) bearded the old Col &amp; secured an extension of leave until after 9 pm And tomorrow they are going to take us for a trip to the Bay. Arrived on board about 9.30</p>
