December
weather being too tough and foggy to venture out with safety.
On Christmas day we weighted anchor and were on our way at 9.30am. The water was full of floating contact mines, Some of them were passed very close. They are I should think about seven feet in diameter and are painted black, they have a lot of large spikes projecting out from their sides. The Captain and crew were firing at them with rifles to try and explode or sink them, They did not succeed in hitting any which no doubt was just as well for us.
At 3pm the Destroyer Radient (F56) left us and steamed away at full speed.
We are now well out of the German mine area, so have no fear of accident from that quarter.
