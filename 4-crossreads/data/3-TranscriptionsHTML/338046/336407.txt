<p>Paddy Hayes (cobber of King's) had not been in the Army before but tried to imagine that he had.  He knew more about Gallipoli than many a man who had been there.   When the gambling got slack, the firm of King and Hayes started a laundry.  Some of the customers got their washing back, some didnt, (things will blow overboard at times).    There was one ingenious way of washing clothes, practised I believe by men on sailing ships.  You tie your clothes into a strong bundle and hang them on a rope in the water.  In about an hour pull them up, and if they are not missing they will be quite clean.   This scheme also has the effect of wearing anything flimsy into shreds.</p>
