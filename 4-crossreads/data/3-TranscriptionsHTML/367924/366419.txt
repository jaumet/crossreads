<p>Out in the Desert<br/>9-6-1917</p>
<p>Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines in answer to your welcome letters. I am in the best of health and trust you are all the same. I recieved two parcels the other day, that makes the fourth one I have got from you thanks for sending the Eumenthols also the buiscuits I think they were the best I ever tasted, they was made with plenty of butter in them I should think, they did not last long as there was five of us to divide them amoungst, the handkerchiefs where in them alright.</p>
<p>A pair of sox is all you need send me now &amp; again in the clothing line. Everything is very dear at the canteens out here, we spend all the money we get in buying tinned fruit &amp; milk. Do not bother to send many parcels, as the cost of sending them must be heavy.</p>
<p>Well I am very pleased to hear that Nell was happy when she was over there, Nell wrote and said she was sorry to go away and that Alie liked being there, poor little kid would enjoy being there I will bet. Do you know you should get letters from me every time an Egyptain mail comes as I write every week.</p>
<p>Well we have shifted back from the front line for a months spell, we are in reserve for ten days, then we go back to the Beach for two or three weeks if we are lucky, after that I expect we will be moving about a good lot. It is terribly dusty where we are at the present time, I will be very pleased when we get back to the beach for a spell. We do some long hours &amp; rides at times, twenty four hour stunts are common things here.</p>
<p>There is no doubt the Light Horse must have the turks thinking, his taubs see in camp alright at sundown, then he wakes up in the morning and perhaps twenty miles away at that, and there we are, all in position right in front of him and then</p>
