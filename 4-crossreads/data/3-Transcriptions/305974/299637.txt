<p>10 Thursday<br/>A very cloudy morning.  A good few of the boys got drunk last night, as they reckon to celebrate our departure to France.  They all seem to be merry even this morning  Got issued with four different articles in the morning to complete my kit. Of course same as usual we were humbugged about a lot before finally receiving what we wanted.  Went for a bit of a march in the afternoon, also in the evening.</p>
<p>11 Friday<br/>Route marches seems to be the principal object of the draft now.  We go about half a mile away &amp; then amuse ourselves until it is time to go back.  We are still uncertain as to when we are to go away.  After coming back from a walk in the evening I developed a spool, They didn't turn out too good.  It still keeps dry.</p>
<p>12 Saturday<br/>Stopped from the 9.30 am parade to help clean up the hut, we finished about 10.30 am, I then did some printing (the photos I developed last night)  They came out fairly good except the one of myself &amp; Riley.  Slept nearly all the afternoon &amp; went for a walk in the evening.</p>
<p>13 Sunday<br/>Of course went <strike> for a </strike> on church parade in the morning, but the Parson didn't turn up.  We sang a few hymns &amp; then came back.  Slept during the afternoon, &amp; went out in the evening.</p>
