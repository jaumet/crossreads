<p>My Dear Sis,<br/>I received your parcel today for which I am very thankful. Of course I had not given up hope of receiving it but we always consider ourselves very lucky if we do get them. Had I got it yesterday I would have saved a shilling as I only bought this pad yesterday. My word I did enjoy a good old smoke (and so did my boss) it made me think of Auburn again &amp; of some of the happy hours you, Vol, Lol &amp; I spent together. Everything was OK except the figs &amp; they were a "dud". The weevils got into them. Only one cigar was broken &amp; yet the tin of cocoa came the proverbial "guttsa" i.e. was dented in a bit, &amp; a bit mixed up with the other goods, but anyway Sis I am real pleased  &amp; thankful at receiving them. The nuts were just lovely. Did Noni put them in? I suppose she will be running down to meet her uncle when he returns. I do wish I was there</p>
