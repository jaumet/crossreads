much obliged.  I love your yarns also the Boss', I fairly yelled at his letter.
Of course I think you should hang on to him & keep him out there, really this business would drive him dilly, I mean the military methods &c.  As things are its much better for him to be running Tog & Telleraga & growing wool &c. than getting his soul case worried out here.  And the climate is awful.  I shall be that glad to get back to Australia.  I just shrieked over your account of the Blind Man's Buff & Miss Royds.  I'd love to have been there although I really think I'm getting too ancient for such pranks.
You would love our Colonel, he's all right, quite young & very smart.  Well I must flee.  I saw Flossie Heller the other day, oh he's a fast young dog.  I saw Duncan in the distance too, he looks so well & the men adore him.  Tell Mac & The Boss I'll write soon.
Much love to all,Wilkie
