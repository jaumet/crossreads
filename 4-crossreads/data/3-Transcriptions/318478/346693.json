<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>I sent in this mornings letter to Kilid Bahr &amp; hope the best.</p>
<p>This afternoon I walked over to Anzac Beach with young Lieut. Balfour, Capt. Bean's offsider, a very nice chap &amp; on the way we came across the remains of what must have been just about the quickest attack on Lone Pine that ever was;<br/>[Drawing]<br/>at one spot the relics lie close up against Jacko's forward line, but so close together that one cannot understand the onward rush.</p>
<p>I did a sketch of the 'Sphinx' from near the landing but a very dull afternoon flattened the interesting modelling clean out and left little else than <strike>I</strike> fine sky line &amp; flat tone against a grey sky.</p>
<p>Tomorrow <strike>the 15th</strike> we cover <strike>the</strike> the most interesting ground on block the day after I cut loose &amp; choose my subject<br/>[Drawing]</p>
