 138 It seems with the Beer Canteen opposite, that a few of our chaps consider it essential that they should, on pay nights, get stone drunk.  The horrible stuff they serve and the work they"ve got to do makes their beans beastly ridiculous.  To get drunk on liquors, wine and shandies, in good company, is pardonable and amusing.  A table outside the Egyptian Bar entering the Classic Wassah, hurriedly served drinks, and the wonderful crowd makes an atmosphere particularly appropriate for slow dull eyed drinking.  The first time I met Ron and his friend in Cairo, God alone knows how we got home, but after leaving them, driving home to Ghezireh in the gharry I distinctly remember stopping him several times to tell him. 
 The Moving Finger writes, etc., and that I"d fled him down the Nights and down the days, etc.  It was the first time I was blind drunk and the whole process I thoroughly enjoyed. 
 139  Aug. 17 Things between the sisters and the chaps seem now to be rapidly approaching a head.  For too long they"ve had entirely their own way, and been supported every time by the Col.  The amusing part is that in half the wards the work they do is of no medical value at all, and all the surgical wards at any rate could be,  and  much better and easier worked without them. 
 Haynet"s at last settled &ndash; harsh, and for gross neglect of duty she"s been suspended, and if there"s any general inquiry she won"t be the only one. 
 One funny change has come in.  Sister &ndash; reported Milford for drinking the patient"s ale &ndash; she promptly reported him for continually drinking the patient"s soda water.  What a life. 
 140  Aug. 19 Tonight I went into Jonas"s tent to ask him about this religious festival of tomorrow they"ve been mentioning in orders.  I got the information I was after, and a yarn started:  I asked Jonas what he"d thought of Thurston"s Traffic.  The book seems now to have passed round the reading crowd and the opinions have been rather different but all agreeing that it was "realistic" (sometimes called "jolly hot").  While J. was about half way through it about a week ago, I"d asked him what he thought of it, and he"d replied, 'A book for little dirty minds!"  Now after he"s finished the book, his criticism is the same as mine, well written, and thought out, splendid in the descriptive opening &ndash; like in a small way Hardy"s "Egdon Heath" &ndash; but spoilt by its ultra realism.  Instead of being satisfied with calling a spade a spade, he calls it a bloody shovel.  It was the problematic side of the book though that I"d wanted J"s opinion on &ndash; and in getting it, he paid me the most appreciated compliment I"ve ever received.  According to J. nobody in the corps, with the exception of 1 &ndash; perhaps, myself, and he, could appreciate the subtle point of the problem &ndash; and as it happened, we both again accepted it in the same light, that Nance"s sacrifice, her degradation and her faithfulness, were her crucifixion, and her salvation.  As a problem book it is a very distinct problem. 
 141 Half way through the last the lights were switched off from Headquarters while the searchlights hunted zepps.  Worse luck they didn"t catch any.  The rays are worked like the cogs of two wheels running together.
