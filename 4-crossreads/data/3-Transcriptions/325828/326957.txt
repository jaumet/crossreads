<p>I am enclosing a short note to her &amp; am sending her two X Xs which I hope she will receive alright<br/>By the same mail I received a letter from Mother dated 14/5/1916.  Thank you Mumie dear for your lovely note &amp; news contained in it.<br/>I saw Rid about 10 days ago- one Saturday evening.  He was going to hold a service in the village the next day, but the next day we were hard at it on the move.  Marvellous?  9 times out of 10 that we move it is on Sunday.<br/>Must close now with best love to you all at home.<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
