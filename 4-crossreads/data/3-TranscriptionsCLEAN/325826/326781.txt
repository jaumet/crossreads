  
 Pension Wales.     R. 30.5.16 Cairo. April 26th. 1916. My very dear Father & Mother, I am writing this rather late for the mail & am not certain that it will catch it, but I have just had a note from Wal by this evening's mail and am anxious to let you know of it in case letters from him to you are not going through As it has already once passed the Censor I can see no harm in posting it on to you as it is.  Perhaps you can guess why he calls me Florrie though I cannot explain all about it just now, will do so when I come home, if ever I manage to get things fixed up so that I can come home.     I am puzzled about his movements, and am beginning to wonder what that cable from London meant and whether he has not been there at all but entrusted it to someone to send from there, there being no other way of sending one.  Of course his letter here is dated 9th April, and the cable was sent from London on 12th so perhaps they simply were moved across the Channel after he wrote.  About the address he gives at the top I do not know what to say or whether it is any use using it.  I tried to find out at Headquarters here the other day what was the correct address, but it is a hopeless business for one told me one thing & another another, though I am inclined to follow the one who told me just to put the Battalion &c. and A.I.F., leaving it to be forwarded; one told me to put Intermediate Base Depot & another not.  It is a mad place to my humble judgment that Headquarters.  This morning
