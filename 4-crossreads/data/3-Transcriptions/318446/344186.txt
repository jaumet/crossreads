<p>El Arish, 22nd Dec.<br/>This camp is too good to last as usual.  There is a move or a stunt or something tonight.<br/>It is a weary world.</p>
<p>"Mag Dabeh", 23rd Dec.<br/>We left camp at six p.m. last night for a stunt to beyond Magdaba straight down the Wadi El Arish.<br/>We arrived there at daybreak having travelled all night as usual &amp; found the turks a few miles further on.<br/>Engaged them &amp; the left flank gave away at once &amp; we have chased them away out of sight.  But on the right flank they are still holding us.  It is now 1 p.m. &amp; so we have not much time before we shall have to go.  The whole division is out &amp; a battery 18 pdr. &amp; the C. Corps &amp; a mountain battery.  The horses have had no water since we started.</p>
