  
 Sunday 3 March Dull with drizzling rain.  We went to A.D.S. to-day at Woormezeele to work on completing dugouts.  Very little is left of the village & some graves about mention Oct. 1914, 1st Battle of Ypres.  I walked up to St. Eloi, of which nothing is left.  The country is rather hilly & our people hold most of the high ground. Artillery lively in the afternoon but no casualties came through. 
 Monday 4 March Another visit to A.D.S. on fatigue work on dugout, placing concrete slabs on the top.
