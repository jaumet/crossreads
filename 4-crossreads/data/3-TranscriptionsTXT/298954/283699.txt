I passed the night in fits and starts on the wooden parcel-rack.     At Stralsund at midnight we got hot coffee, bread, & sausage, crossing the Straits on the train-ferry immediately afterwards.
Mon 25th Nov.6 am. found us pulling into the quaint station of Sassnitz, the Baltic in front of us in the grey dawn &  the lights of a trim passenger ship blinking by the quay.
A stately big Danish woman in a most becoming Red Cross costume was at the gangway - I would have loved to have hugged her, the smiling angel!   Then an awful rumour spread along the crowded train - the vessel was only prepared for less than 1000 prisoners & at any rate 200 must remain in Sassnitz for 2 days.    And the rumour was true, but those in our compartment were among the fortunate who boarded the beautifully appointed "Kong Haakon" & luxuriated in the little cabins, with such spotless linen.   And the breakfast in the saloon, plain, good, Danish dairy food;  eggs butter milk etc. served by efficient stewards - 'twas ecstasy.
