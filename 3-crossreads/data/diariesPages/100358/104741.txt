which commenced the Somme offensive, and which resulted in the Huns being driven from 3 superb lines of defense, between Becordel to Mametz Wood ? Contal-Maison, Fricourt etc., was undoubtedly a more costly and more important event. To look over it now leaves us "stunned" . It is too huge to grasp. Even the individual man present throughout the fortnight could not comprehend the gigantic scale of all branches of these operations. It was a masterpiece of organisation at Headquarters, and a triumph over our previous shortage of munitions.
