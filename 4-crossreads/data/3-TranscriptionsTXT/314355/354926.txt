XV Corps. No. 128/28.G.
Major-General T.W. Glasgow, CB. CMG. DSO.Commanding 1st Australian Division,
Before your magnificient Division leaves my Corps, I wish to thank you and all ranks under your command for the exceptional services rendered during the past four months.
Joining this Corps on April 12th during the Battle of the Lys, the Division selected and prepared a position to defend the Hazebrouck Front, and a few days later repulsed two heavy attacks with severe losses to the enemy.  This action brought the enemys advance to a standstill.
Since then, the Division has held the most important sector of this front continuously, and by skilful raiding and minor operations has advanced the line over a mile on a front of 5,000 yards, capturing just short of 1,000 prisoners, and causing such damage to the troops of the enemy that nine Divisions have been replaced.
The complete success of all minor operations;  the skill displayed by the patrols by day as well as by night;  the gallantry and determination of the troops;  and their high state of training and discipline have excited the admiration and emulation of all, and I desire that you will convey to all ranks my high appreciation of their fine work and my regret that the Division is leaving my Command.
(sgd) Beauvoir de Lisle.Lieutenant-General,Commanding XV Corps.
