<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>Here it is Saturday night 9.15pm.  I have just returned from the Y.W.C.A. where I have been playing for a Dance.  The musician did not turn up so I was the only one that could play.  We go to a Dance every Tuesday &amp; Saturday &amp; a musical Evening every Sunday.  It is good pastime &amp; there are some nice People &amp; altogether we spend some good evenings.  I went with my Salisbury Friends the Edmonds to a Social &amp; Dance last Tuesday &amp; I played quite a number of Dances there.  I was feeling lively which is a rare state for me so I hopped in &amp; kept the ball rolling as most of the people were on the dull side.  Of course I stayed over night &amp; slept well although I had a feather bed.  I am writing in Dick's flat &amp; using His paper etc.  He is away up at the mess &amp; will be down shortly.  He is going away shortly up to London in connection with His profession.  We will miss Him rather much for He has grown into a very dear Pal.  He will be away about 3 months &amp; will then be due for return to Aussie.  We have had an awful spell of clear icy frosty weather &amp; in consequence the Hospital is in an awful mess.  More than &frac12; the pipes have burst &amp; of course the Latrines can get no water &amp; everything was frozen up until yesterday when the rain came.  I much prefer the wet sloppy weather for one can get warm then.  I am all alone now as Ellis has gone to London on Duty.</p>
