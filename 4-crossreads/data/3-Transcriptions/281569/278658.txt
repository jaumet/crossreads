<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>My old horse is feeling no ill-effects from her gallop &amp; if anything did her good, news came to hand that we could get rid of 42 horses today to the second Regt so all the morning was put in picking them out &amp; sorting the harness to go with them, my old Lem has to go worse luck &amp; many of the other old horses.</p>
<p>Our brigade took over from the Tommies today &amp; now our general commands the whole of the district &amp; consequently moved up into the building occupied by the HQ's previously.</p>
<p>Tommy motor cyclist reported for acting the nanny up the town last night &amp; Capt Weir was accordingly sent down to interview us but no such luck for him.</p>
<p>Day has been again very windy &amp; dusty &amp; plenty of heat. Bed at 9.10.</p>
