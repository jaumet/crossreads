<p>Wednesday 8 August 1917</p>
<p>Alexandria.<br/>Arrived 1.30 p.m. or 13.30 as we write it &ndash; sent to No. 10 Convalescent Hospital, a fine building taken over from a HUN, cotton Merchant facing the sea, in nice grounds. Here I expect to stay one week then back to Palestine.</p>
<p>Am feeling fitter but very slack.</p>
<p>A mixture of Tommy Officers &amp; Australians are here, they do not always blend well. But Scotties &amp; Colonials do - <strike>it is the younger English pups speak so disparagingly of our folk &ndash; However!!!  A lot of them bring it on themselves.</strike></p>
