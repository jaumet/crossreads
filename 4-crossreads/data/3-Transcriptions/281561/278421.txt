<p>17/8/17<br/>Went to the Bank and drew some money this morning &ndash; Was fooled around for an hour. Fitted myself out in wonderful holiday attire. Went for a tour of the sights Westminister Abbey is the most wonderful piece of work. Then I presented myself at Manchester Street.  Spent the night in town. Oh! This is a lovely city.<br/>19/8/17<br/>Yesterday I went to Kensington in the morning, to see Holman Hunts collection of pictures. I catch on fine with these people even if I never heard of them before. They seem to like to have a tame Australian; and so intelligent too! It appears to me that this comfortable class of English people; thought the Australians were a savage tribe; were very fierce amd cantankerous; and wore bones in their noses. There is no need to tell them yarns drawn from my imagination.</p>
