  
 you can get any amount of them, but I expect this state of affairs won't last long. 
 29th.  On the same job again today only the parties are all split up.  We had a few anxious moments last night old Fritz dropped heavy shells all round us & the clods fell like rain on our slender little humpy, we were expecting every shell to land right on us, but they knocked off in time.  A man would be dead stiff to stop a shell right back here, but you never know when one will blot you out for he drops them at random day & night & they are likely to catch some one. 
 It rained a fair bit last night & melted all the frozen ground, the consequence is, that today everything is soft & muck once more, & King mud reigns supreme.
