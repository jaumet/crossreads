30.4.15Fri. 30th.  Dismounted parade all day & were signalling to B Sqd. had a fairly easy time of it.  I see by tonights paper that there was great rejoicing in Australasia when they heard of the work done at the Dardanelles, these papers publish no news of any consequence.
Tonight at the Y.M.C.A. Col. Merrington said that our casualties was 2,500 & 600 killed.  I put the night in writing.  I believe my name came out in orders tonight as Corporal of C Sqd. signallers.
