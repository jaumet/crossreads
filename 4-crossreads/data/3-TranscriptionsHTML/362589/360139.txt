<p>Dear Judge,</p>
<p>So very many thanks for your two letters &ndash; all the more welcome as they arrived when I was in Hospital.<br/>As you know by now we had a very big fight, &amp; the first Brigade had to attack some Turkish trenches known as Lonesome Pine, took it all right, but our casualties of necessity were heavy. I got a <strike>H</strike> crack on the knee &ndash; very slight &ndash; it was more the concussion of the shell bursting that bust my knee up. I also got dysentery rather badly &ndash; this was just before the attack, &amp; after the show</p>
