 Today I see in the paper that a fresh clamour for conscription is rising in Australia, and that Hughes may support it because the Russian situation has introduced a new &amp; unexpected factor into the general situation. The feeling is due, (so states the cable) to a  "vigorous speech from Sir Wm. Irvine." I wonder if , &amp; how soon the movement will come to a head. 
 Lying in bed with a knee which renders one useless and practically helpless, you can imagine with what mixed feelings I read of the successful attack on and capture of the Messines ridge,    behind which I have been stationed ever since I came to France.   For months I had been waiting for this "show" and knew it would come about May or June, and was looking forward to it  and to the part we would play in it. Then at the critical moment I was not there. It was very disappointing. 
 My present slow rate of progress makes me wonder when I shall be really fit for work again. I have become pretty thin especially about the legs, but I would soon build that up if the rheumatism would only go right out of the knee. My worst enemies at present seem to be the occasional thunderstorms which act as "set-backs" and hindrances to my recovery. Consequently they are not popular with me. Otherwise I am well and doing an enormous amount of reading &ndash; all novels but of the better class. 
 I must stop &amp; hurry this off to catch the afternoon mail. 
 With affectionate regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; yourself Yours v. sincerely L: O'C: Whitfield
