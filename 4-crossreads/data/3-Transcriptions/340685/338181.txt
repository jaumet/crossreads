<p>with another chap sitting on my boots. Needless to say I slept little and the coal smuts covered us from foot to head and we saw again nothing of the country. Fairly cold towards morning but the overcoat made everything alright.<br/>10.5.16 Woke up at dawn just as we were entering the outskirts of Alexandria which is swampy with shallow lakes whereon fishermen in flat bottomed boats were fishing by the score. The land grew a high sort of reed very like sorghum and Alexandria itself from what we could see of it is a very big place. The train took right to the wharf where our steamer lay and after a short delay we went on board the "Caledonia". She is about 12,000 two funnelled fast and a very excellent boat taken all round and has a twelve pounder aft for submarines in the Mediterranean. The second and third saloons are used as troop decks and the officers quarters are really fine. Arrive about 6.30 (120 miles) and we have on board all sorts of troops and things are very crowded in the mess rooms. I was hard at work all the morning organising the messes and everything was in a horrible muddle through the inadvertence of an officer. However things are nearly right now. We left dock at about 4 and are now waiting outside to depart and I am going straight to bed as I am dead tired and have slung my hammock on the next to top covered deck and is  very fine position. Our little O.C. (of the infantry) is a very nice little fellow &ndash; quiet and tries hard to do all in his power for his men.<br/>11.5.16 Stayed out in the stream all day yesterday and left this morning at about 7. Later on we learned there was a <strike>subsam</strike> submarine just outside but we happily missed it. We wear lifebelts continuously except at night when we use them as pillows and all lights and matches struck are strictly forbidden even pipes and cigarettes alight are not allowed after sundown. our course is a zigzag one and we are always changing thus making it difficult to get our position. The boat Caledonia Anchor line about 12000 is a beauty and can rise to 20 knots usual steaming being 16</p>
