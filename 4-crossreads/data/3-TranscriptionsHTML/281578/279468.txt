As usual there is a very fine church in this village. It rained tonight, &amp; came through our roof in places. Just a few yards outside are some big guns, 60 pounders. Lor', when one fires, it makes our building shake, &amp; if you happen to be doing anything, your arm jumps &amp; you nearly drop whatever is in your hand, &amp; the roar is deafening. Couldn't sleep much at night, had a nice comfortable bed on straw with blanket, greatcoat &amp; waterproof sheet, but the big gun was blazing every now &amp; again, &amp; making a fearful row. Sunday 28 April Had a nice quiet day, one parade to inspect arms &amp;c. It is dull &amp; cold after a very wet night, &amp; altogether too cold to go into the river for a clean up, worse luck. They are great gamblers in this company, always playing two-up, &amp;c.  331/3 &percnt; (one third) of the Bn. stay out every time we go into the line, those who are left out are envied (in spite of newspaper rot to the contrary) &amp; those who go in hope</p>
