<p>France.<br/>6th June 1916.</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>I received three parcels yesterday, so things are looking up.  One was the Vest, which is more than handy just now, as I am without an Overcoat.  The next one was from Ruby with a couple of pairs of socks, writing pad etc., and the other one as far as I can make out, as there was no note with it, was from Mrs. Moore.  Please thank her very much for me, it was very good of her to send it.</p>
<p>Things are as per usual here.  The fine weather has broken and we have had a spell of rain and cold, but it looks as if it is going to clear off again.</p>
<p>There was a mail in some days ago, but a very unsatisfactory one.  I had a letter from Father, but it was the only one from home.</p>
<p>We have been kept going some lately and I have no time to sit down and try and think out a letter just at present, but will write again in a few days time.</p>
<p>Am still O.K. and going strong.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to everyone round about and love to all at home.</p>
<p>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
