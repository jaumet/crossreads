 Frid. 16-6-'16. 1.30 p.m. Got rid of our blankets when we heard of the 12 mile march ahead of us &ndash; Mac's put on seat of Motor Transport the other given to Kiddies working on Rlys. These Kiddies &amp; women work in father's &amp; hubby's place. Allotment only = 1 Franc per diem. I pity them. Frid. 16-6-'16. Marched to Sailly. Billetted in Farm house for the night. Noted Sailly Church destroyed by shells. Germans were here a year ago &amp; had machine guns on top of steeple. Our sleeping quarters were on straw in the Pens. Quite a homely scene. Discovered &amp; took Mac along to see Misther Murphy.
