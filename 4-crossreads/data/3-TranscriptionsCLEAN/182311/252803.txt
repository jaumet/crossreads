The wonderful monuments & Arches, Admiralty Arch, Marble Arch, the monument, Trafalgar Square with its Lions, its tall column surmounted by Nelsons Statue. The effigies of Statesmen & Soldier in all the parks & reserves were productive of great satisfaction but also the picture galleries were closed & their valuable pictures, their "Moner Elizas" were safe in underground vaults quite away from possible damage by Zeppelins bombs.
   London by night is a city of darkness, streets lamps are shaded, all blinds are drawn, lights on vehicles are reduced to the smallest possible glare, & even ^the trains have all blinds drawn.
   Last night when I left London 'twas enveloped in a real London fog, this further emphasised the effect of the reduced lighting & one had to cross roads, feeling the way from island to island & chancing accidents, small boys with lanterns were everywhere earning coppers, but their value lay not in the light they carried but in their knowledge of the locality.
