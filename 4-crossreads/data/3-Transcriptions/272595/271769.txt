<p>Put in for a pass yesterday, expect I wont get it for I believe all leave is knocked on the head till the 4th of Oct. on account of the railway strike.<br/>Charlie Tonkin one of my old platoon Cpls came across from the OTB. to see me tonight he got hit a few days after me &amp; has just come from Hurdcott.  I was pleased to see him for he is a very decent chap, we went for a stroll together &amp; had a yarn over old times.  Has been raining on &amp; off the whole afternoon &amp; it looks very showery tonight<br/>The Railway strike ended today but unfortunately all leave has been cancelled till the 4th to get the lines in running order again, this has been a very unpopular strike among the people for they went out on strike against even their own</p>
