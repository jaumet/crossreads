Tuesday 5 Sept. 1916Up at 3.30 a.m. & went round part of the line with the General. It was beautifully starlight & the early morning fine but everything underfoot was fearfully wet. An interesting walk round, landing us back at H.Q. a little after 8 o'c. Rain commenced soon afterwards & continued more or less constantly throughout the day. Was able to remain under cover attending to gas alarms &c.A real tragedy happened in the 2nd Bn. through a "minnie" landing in a Co. H.Q. dug-out & killing Capts. Murray & Chant, Lieuts. Callaway & Dabbs & 2 4th Bn. officers, together with several N.C.O.s & men. At night Padres MacAuliffe & McKenzie conducted the burial service in the darkness - a weird experience.
