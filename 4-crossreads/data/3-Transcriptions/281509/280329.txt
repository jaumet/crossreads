<p>16 April 1916<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>A day of note. We sight land at 9 a.m. great excitement on board. Quite a pleasant change from the endless sea.  Cape Guardafin rises 200 feet up from the sea with a background of high mountains 3,000 ft altitude. Rough inhospitable coast passed 3 native sampans fishing smacks.</p>
