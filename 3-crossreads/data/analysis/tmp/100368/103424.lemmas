 the out come . Monday Sept 27th Left Camp 7.45 a.m. Took tram to the harbor at Alex--, and board the " S.S. Inkosi " for transport no one knew where . The " Inkosi " has a tonnag of 6000 ton . The harbour look well with the larg number of ship therein . There were there all kind of ship , larg and small , conspicu amongst them was the Hospit ship with their green band on a white ground and larg red cross in the centr . The " Siang Choon " and the " Shropshir " were lie by our side . The troop on board the " Inkosi " consist of British and Australian most reinforc , men who had left their unit sick or wound and were now return back to their battalion recov in health again . We cast anchor at 6.45 p.m. and as we pass the entranc to the harbour our pilot left us and went out to a boat which was there readi to receiv him . We have been all issu with life belt and appoint to the various small boat which we are to use in case of accid or in be torpedo . A necessari precaut . Tue 28th Sept. Sea has been veri calm . It was amus to see us stand in a queue wait our turn to wash ourselv . A beauti moonlight night . Said to be in the danger zone . Great precaut are be taken as regard light out on the ship . Thur 30 Sept. Said to be in this vicin that the " Royal Edward " was sunk . Land to be seen on both side of us . We seem to be take a peculiar rout . The reason is obvious . Had a veri restless night . The destroy "Skirmish " and also a French destroy mark " C2 " are circl around us . It is pretti to see the grace movement of the littl battleship , it is inde most wonder how they do it . The land seen from here is of a mountain natur and wind mill are to be seen on the high hill which prove , though the place look barren and bare to us there must inevit be mani peopl inhabit these part . A sail ship is make headway in front of us . It seem to be suspect of someth for the French destroy is make circl round and round it . The sail ship has stop , also the destroy . We anxious wait and watch to see what was go to happen . Everyth seem all right for the destroy made off leav us far behind . Oct 1st Frid . We reach Lemno Island this morn about 9.30 . As we enter the harbour there were numer contriv put there for guard the enter . Onli a small entranc was open to allow ship to pass through . A boom of chain and buoy stretch from both side which made passag almost imposs but by the small entranc left open . The harbour is veri larg and veri deep . Larg number of ship of all descript were lie anchor in the harbour . Small sail boat larg hospit ship , destroy and huge warship were all there . As we got further up the bay we becam more and more surround by land . Here and there we could see the white outlin of small villag against the darker background of the bare , barren hill . On the top of these rug hill we could see the outlin of numer windmil . These windmil were of a differ construct from what we had seen and imagin windmil to be . The wing of the mill were the same but the construct of the mill was like a haystack and they were built of stone . Amongst the few villag that one could see , there was one which seem to be larger and more outstand from the other . This prove to be the town of Mudro . Oct 2nd Sat . Heard one of the warship Band play which sound veri well across the water in the bay . Oct 3rd Sun . The scene is veri peac this morn . Hard to believ that we are onli 40 mile away from the scene of fight . This voyag over in the " Inkosi " has been a sarvat voyag inde . Even to buy anyth out of the canteen an exorbit price is charg for it . Went aboard the small steamer " Partridg " . It is be load with ammunit and is also crowd with troop . As we were go down the bay we pass a number of " Alli " warship . No cheer are allow to be given . The sailor stand at attent and flag signal are sent up . An airship is sail through the air abov us . The " Partridg " is a veri fast boat and cut through the water veri rapid . The night has got veri misti and veri cold and we huddl ourselv to-geth , to save ourselv from the cold , bite wind , as much as possibl . As we near Gallipoli we saw a flash light on Cape Hella . As we near the shore the sound of incess rifl fire and the sound of bullet drop into the water gave one definit notic that we had reach the scene of action . As we were leav the barg to go ashor a few bullet fell on to it , wound one of our number in the arm . He had just been return from hospit have alreadi been wound . To the right of us lay a battleship , from which a magnific searchlight was show on to the shore . The sound of a tremend report of a larg gun fire startl us and one could clear see by mean of the searchlight , the smoke rise at the spot the shell had burst . It seem as if these shell were travel along the searchlight . A larg number of shell were sent over and look at it from where we were one wonder how anyth or anyon could live there . There were a few red light on the high ridg abov , the signific of which I do not at present know . We land near the C.C.S. and go into their shelter the first thing I saw was a man with part of his head blown off and yet he was still aliv . We slept on the beach all night . Oct 4th Mon . Made my way to the reinforc camp in Shrapnel Gulli . Just after breakfast when we had fallen in on parad along with other reinforc the Turk began to shell us and drop shell fast and furious on the ridg abov the gulli . What a scatter there was . We all made for place of safeti just like rabbit when they have been startl make for their burrow , we made for hole in the earth for the same reason . We were not fortun in our choic of place . Five of us crowd under a narrow ledg . This was our first experi of be under shell fire . They whizz over our head , burst all around us and we spent an anxious hour , trembl at everi shell that burst as they threw earth , stone and metal in everi direct . Howev , at the end of an hour bombard the shell ceas , none of us have been hit much to our relief . After the bombard a " Taub " made his appear in the air presum to see what damag the shell had done . Not wish to experi the same again , as we had gone through this morn we set to work to make a proper dug-out . At night we got order that we had to return to Mudro . Our dug-out was too small for four of us and we spent a veri uncomfort night there . There was continu rifl fire , the whole night long . The familiar Egyptian that we had seen so much of in Egypt was to be seen here also , do labour work . Oct 5th Tue . Pack up and went aboard the SS El Kahira . Three of our boy refus to return with us . Arrive at Mudro in the afternoon . Had to walk three mile to the A.D. Camp . Oct 6th Wed . Had to sleep out in the open . Food is veri , veri scarc here . We were all put on fatigu duti carri stone . The ground here is veri stoni . The hill are of a volcan natur . Had a walk through one of the Greek villag about here . The hous are veri irregular built . Not much format about them . Women are to be seen spin wool by hand . Quit a contrast to this , at one hous sit outsid an old ladi was sit spin by hand while insid the doorway a young girl was stitch some garment with an up-to-d " Singer " sew machin . Inside most of the hous they look veri clean and tidi . Oct 7th Thursday . Unload store in the forenoon . Went into anoth camp away in anoth part of the island . Met Rentoul Middleton , Adam and Hart . Spent an interest time relat our experi sinc we had part . Saw the villag weav cloth by a hand loom . We also saw them winnow grain . The grain that they grow here is dark colour and the bread is likewis of a dark colour , bake in the form of a larg scone . This bread is so scarc there be so mani troop here , the price of it is exhorbit , even then , it is so run upon that we ca n't get ani . This , coupl with the fact that our ration are veri , veri poor , and short , make thing miser on this bare , barren island . The water here has to be drawn from the well and that is veri scarc also . The villag are veri much annoy at us take their water . Oct 8th Frid . There is a camp of Scottish troop here , henc the sound of the bagpip which we hear . All the time we have been in this detail camp we have had to sleep out in the open . Not have ani cover at all , we are veri wet from the mist which gather dure the night . We fix up a bivouac , Davi and I , to tri and obviat this . Dure the night such a terrif storm took place our bivouac was blown away . The rain came down in torrent , the wind blew a hurrican , and the lightn flash , light up the dark continu . There were one or two biscuit and other tin dump near by and in the dark we could not see what was come our way . One could hear the nois of tin be blown rapid forward in our direct , by the wind , and I expect everi minut to get a knock on the head by one of them , the dark , between the sudden and short interv of light caus by the lightn , was so intens . Oct 10th Sunday . Church parad earli this morn . The ring of church bell in the littl Greek villag was veri pleasant . The morn was bright and beauti and the island seme so veri peac . Oct 11th Mon .

Oct 14th Rifl fire is kept up continu dure the night time and dure the day it is more or less continu but not so heavi . Enjoy this open-air life veri much . Food is pretti good and enough of it . We are situat in a deep gulli , with almost perpendicular hill partial cover with shrubberi on either side . Oct 14th Thur . Have to cook most of our food ourselv . We have improv a few use thing such as stove etc . for this purpos . Machin gun fire veri activ last night .

There we saw on the ridg not veri far away , the Turk front line of trench . It was a veri stiff climb up the mule path to Walker Ridg . Anzac with it dug-out look like the burrow of rabbit on a larg scale . We came down by anoth path which was exceed narrow and it not be a regular path , it was exceed steep and one had veri great difficulti in keep their feet . To make a slip would have meant tumbl down into the gulli far beneath . On our way we descend into a camp of Indian who were busi there cook their own particular food . A pretti scene down in this gulli was two kid along with their mother . See this transfer one 's mind eye back to scene of farm life and of home . In the afternoon we were all sent down to the beach to be attach to No 1 A.C.C.S. On reach the No 1 A.C.C.S. we got five bell tent to fix up , well under the ridg . These we were to occupi for the time be . We had just finish fix up these tent and had gone round to the cookhous for our tea . On return with our ration we had just settl down to partak of our tea when a shell burst on the ridg direct abov us . This caus a great stir amongst us and we all immedi tumbl out of the tent door and made for shelter behind the cookhous which was built of sand bag . After a time when we thought that the shell had ceas we return to our tent . Apart from the excit of the moment the thing that troubl me most was the loss of my hot cup of tea . In the hurri exit from the tent my mess tin had been upset and not a drop of tea was left . The even was chilli and cold and the cup of hot tea was realli necessari inde . Oct 16th Sat . Terrif bombard took place dure the night by our own warship from the sea . Be new to this kind of thing it was a sourc of great alarm amongst us . The twenti attach men were put on dig our two huge dug-out , one for an Operat Theatr and anoth larger one to be use as a dispensari . In the even when it was begin to get veri dark D and myself took a walk along the beach toward Anzac Cove .

There they were wait to be laod up with store to be taken up the steep inclin to the troop in the trench dure the night time . Along the water edg were a number of skeleton of boat which had appar been destroy at one time or other and then been thrown up on the beach .

Got a day off to dig a dug-out for ourselv . Beauti moonlight night . A terrif wind blow which necessit the fix of the tent repeat . In some part here there is onli about a thousand yard between our front-lin of trench and the sea . This make one think that it would not take much of a push to sweep us into the sea . There is not much chanc of buy mani luxuri here . Oct 20th Wed Put the finish touch to the o.t . and d . They look veri well now be line with linen sheet and the o.t . has got a concret floor . Learn afterward that what was to be the dispensari is now to be the offic mess . The name dispensari is onli a blind . One of the mani dodg one find in the armi . Oct 22nd Fri . Had to wheel a number of patient along the beach from the old station to the new one . This we found pretti difficult work owe to the congest of traffic and the broken up way that we had to go along .

The pier was five or six hundr yard from the C.C.S. and it was no joke carri some of the big , heavi men along the broken up path to these barg . Even when one felt in good condit the work was heavi enough . After finish this work I saw the M.O. and he gave me some aspirin and I was sent to bed . Oct 26th Tue . Stretcher bear to dress tent . Oct 27th Wed . Load up the barg with wound . A terrif storm rage on the sea . The barg took four hour to cover the distanc of a mile and a half to the hospit ship . When it was fix up along side of the hospit ship the strain was so much that the cabl snap and they had to bring the load barg back to the pier again over the stormi water . They were eight hour in cover the short distanc and it was inde a terribl experi for those men on board . Added to their wound or sick they had the aw condit of sea sick to put up with . The chap who came over here reckon that they are be unfair dealt with by the N.C.O.s of this unit . In this I agre with them . The sunset here are most beauti . Oct 28th Thur .

Our dug-out was place well up on the hill and one found themselv put to a great deal of exert to get there . Cudgel our brain for a name for our dug-out we at length decid to call it " Excelsior " rememb Longfellow poem of that name and take into consider where it was made and under what circumst we had made it this name was veri appropri . Not feel too well these last few day . Oct 31st Sunday . Found a bullet at the entranc to our dug-out . Egyptian Labour Corp out on strike . The shell appar is too much for them . A parti of them had found a bomb . Think that this bomb would make a good light in the dark of their home they had endeavour to light it with disastr result . Two of them were kill and a few other were wound . Moral: - " Do n't tamper with thing you know noth about " . Nov 1st Sea has been veri rough . The wave are dash over the pier . These two pier are our most import point . If we lose them or they are damag in ani way , thing will be veri crook for all on Anzac. On to them all our ammunit store etc are load and should these pier be wash away our difficulti are go to be great increas . Look at the posit here one feel that we are onli hang on by a thread . The littl tug the " Gabe " which has given me mani pleasant moment watch as she sail about like a duck in a pond is no more . Dure the recent storm she got strand . One felt that they had lost a friend in lose littl " Gabe" . Nov 2nd Tue . Sea veri calm . Evacuat earli this morn . Mellow autumn is at hand . Even a wintri touch is in the air , enhanc by the appear and chirp of littl robin red breast . I took some interest in this littl bird as it flit about the scrub on the hillsid . There were so few bird to be seen here . Point the littl bird out to anoth chap I had no sooner done so than he made a dive for a stone and threw it at the bird . Here was I mental pictur a littl pleasur in see littl robin red breast , and the other , he seem to see noth els but to throw a stone at it . A contrast in the point of view of look at one and the same thing , by differ individu . Nov 3rd Wed . Sea calm . Sun hot dure the day . No 1 Stationari Hospit arriv dure the night time . One of the member got knock by a bullet in the eye as he was come ashor . No 1 Stationari are put up a hospit just below us . Owing to the sun be so hot and the entic appear of the calm blue sea a number of men took it into their head to have a dip in the brini . They had not long enter when Johnni Turk must have seen them , for he drop a few shrapnel peril near . Luckili none of the men were injur and discret be the better part of valour they took warn and got out of it in doubl quick time . Carri Capt Carlisl down to the barg on a stretcher . He has append and is be hurri across to the hospit ship to be oper upon . Look away in the Suvla Bay direct one saw what appear to be a terrif explos as if a mine had been blown up .

About a mile or so , away to the right of us is No 16 C.C.S. British , Shell a be drop about them five at a time . I reckon that hundr must have drop in and around them dure this afternoon . It was a magnific spectacl . The report of the gun as they fire , the louder report as they explod and the thirti or forti feet of earth as they burst made a magnific spectacl look from the point where I was stand . But what of the men who were in amongst it all ? There feel can be much better imagin than describ . The head quarter at this part were also destroy . The patient in No 16 C.C.S. were transfer to us as their station was destroy by this afternoon 's sport . A number were kill and mani wound . Nov 12th Fri . Receiv a few luxuri from the Aust- War Comfort Fund . Amongst these luxuri was a tin of insect powder . What would n't we do to get rid of " Chat " ? Inocul against cholera . Nov 13th Sat Away out on the sea we saw a "destroy " and about two o'clock a launch left it side and made for the pier on North Beach . A number of offic disembark from the launch and climb up the steep inclin toward Walker Ridg . About three o'clock we heard the sound of lusti cheer and then we learn that Lord Kitchen was pay us a visit . He walk with quick spright step . I was work away and onli saw him from a distanc . He spoke a few word to the group of men who were gather round him and then amidst lusti cheer he made his departur again in the launch . The red cap , rainbow breast offic salut him as he left the pier . From where I was these offic look like wax figur or doll , pull the string and the figur move sort of busi . The abov account for the activ of the "big head " earlier in the morn when we were evacu our patient . Instead of thing work smooth as they usual did everyth went wrong owe to the interfer of these so-cal "brain " of the armi . Nov 14th Sun .

To while the time away one found pleasur in memor matter which one happen to read , poem etc . Nov 25th Thur . This is my first anniversari of Active Servic . Shell are drop too near my my dugout for my like . One drop almost on to it this even . B and I were sit write letter when sudden , there was a heavi thud , the earth shook and someth heavi fell on our roof and the light almost blew out . It gave us a start , and expect that anoth would come short , which it did we made down the hill to the cookhous where there was a light and where there was a fair amount of safeti . A few more shell were sent over and then we made our way back to our dugout again there to sleep over our previous night 's experi . The shell which are be sent over in our direct now must be from Howitz as they seem to get right into the gulli . Nov 26th Fri . We had a heavi shower of rain this afternoon . At night time the rain came down in torrent . The lighten flash and light up the whole place . The thunder roll as I had never heard it roll befor . This was such a night as I never can forget . The storm last the whole night long . Nov 27th Sat . By morn , the storm abat but it is exceed cold . Away over on the right the Turk is pour shrapnel over . The air is cover with puff of smoke and tongu of flame . By some mean or other B. my dug-out mate has got into his possess a number of paper cover novel , and our even are be pleasant spent read them . " The Cage " by Harold Begbi , " Kate Carnegi " by Ian Maclaren , " Scottish Life and Charact " by Dean Ramsey , are some of the titl of these book . Nov 28th Sun . On put our head out of the dug-out this morn we learn whi , that it had been so cold all night . Snow had fallen dure the night and the ground all around was cover with a white coat . The snow continu to fall all day . It was veri nice to see but one felt bitter cold with it all . Our duti to-day consist of clear the snow of the roof of the tent by mean of long pole and brush . The snow had settl on the roof so thick , that it was weigh the roof down consider . This was rather a cold job but enter into the fun of the thing and see the humor side of these condit we had veri good sport with it all . Some of the Aussi who had never seen snow in their live befor were veri excit at the experi . The " Beetl " the barg which we use to load up our wound to be taken over to the hospit ship has got strand on the rock of Imbros . Now , we have to load the patient on to small boat and they are be pull over by a motor launch . This is a veri much slower process than load up a barg . A descript of the insid of our dug-out as it is now may be veri interest . There are three of us in this "hole " in the earth . Three of the side are built up with sand bag fill with earth . As we were onli allow twenti five bag to make our dug-out , and to build our took a few hundr , where we got the addit bag I am not go to say . As possess is nine-tenth of the law , that , in time of war was to us suffici . We fix up three stretcher on box and made comfort bed . A box fix up in the centr act as a tabl and anoth box fix up at the side took the place in our home of a cupboard . In it we kept a few book and our eat utensil . We cut hole in the wall of our dugout and fit biscuit tin therein we kept some food safe from the interfer of vermin , ant , rat etc . We got some old canva and line our wall as best we could to keep back the fall earth . On this canva we stuck P.P.C. pictur cut from newspap etc . The three differ tempera of the occup of this mansion ? Were shown in the choic of the wall decor . B. had his part of the wall cover with photo of famous actor , D had his part cover with humor draw from Punch and other comic newspap which we manag to get the hold of , while M 's particular frame of mind was appeal to by place cut , poetri , etc from newspap on the wall . From the manner in which our home was decor we found no end of mental recreat which pass mani weari hour away . Over the roof of the dug-out were place two tarpaulin , one which we were allow and anoth which we had not been allow but still we got , it , needless to say how . In order that too mani question should not be ask us regard where we had got the surplus sandbag we cover the side of the dug-out with scrub . Of an even we had quit a number of visit from other chap who could not rest themselv in their own dug-out . Sit there , yarn amongst the thick smoke from tobacco , there be no outlet for it , we spent mani a pleasant even in this way . " W" came into our dugout this morn and made the remark that he had never seen snow befor and that he was not enamour of the experi of winter time in this part of the globe . We were put on fatigu duti this forenoon brush the snow from off the tent . Rather a cold job it was too . In the afternoon all work in the station was stop . B. who had to go round to various Battalion Headquart with the few effect belong to men who had die of wound in the C.C.S. and he ask us to come with him which we did . To get to the H.Q.s we had to climb up high hill and go down into deep gulli . The wet weather made this kind of walk veri difficult inde . At time we were knee deep in mud . We were right in the trench and had also to pass by danger open corner . Owing to the dul of the weather , thing , this afternoon were veri quiet and we got round and back to the C.C.S. without mishap , feel tire out but warm with the exert . Mon . Nov 29th Advantag has apprent been taken of the dull weather by the Turk to shift his gun into new posit . This morn we were subject to a veri heavi bombard of high explos . They land into place where no shell had drop befor sinc we came here . We evacu all the patient from the hospit into the sap and the huge dug-out which had been made for emerg . This gave a littl safeti . One unfortun chap had just got into a sap when a shell burst besid him caus an ugli gash in his thigh . He was in hospit suffer from jaundic and I am sure between the two his chanc of surviv are veri poor . One of the shell went right through the oper tent but fortun for some , it did not explod . Had it explod a few of the occup of the tent would not have live to tell the tale . Read Ian Maclaren 's " Kate Carnegi " in which I found the proverb which I thought veri funni and yet veri true: - Scat and bite Mak ? Scot fouk 's ?oong Nov 30th As I was lie on the stretcher in our dug-out a bullet pass through the tarpaulin just abov me and struck the tin box near the roof . We receiv a larg number of casualti to-day . As two battalion were chang over the Turk got wind of it and shell right on to them . Owing to the evacu of wound be carri out in small boat , the station is so slowli evacu that our station has becom full up owe to the overflow . The first day that we land in Shrapnel Gulli we saw an Indian who was go about cut the soldier hair . To-day we learn that he had been arrest and shot as a spi . Dec 1st Wed .

Saw a veri touch part to-day . A larg number of Maltes are do labour work here . One of their number was go aboard the barg appar be evacu sick .

Dec 8th Wed . We evacu our patient dure the night . This is a pretti difficult job as there is no light bar one right on the point of the pier . Howev we have carri stretcher this few hundr yard so often that we seem to know everi step of the way , even in the pitch dark . Dec 8th Wed . Hospit again bombard with howitz . One of the shell went right through our oper tent but did not explod . They would not have been left to tell the tale . It is marvel that onli one person has been wound in these now frequent bombard of the C.C.S. L.R. and G.P. dug the unexplod shell out of the earth in do so they had to dig about four feet down for it . Dec 9th Beauti weather at present . No hospit ship in sight .

It had no sooner done so than over pour shell after shell . Time and again we thought she was hit the shell drop all around . We were interest spectat of this incid and it was like watch an excit footbal match . Everi minut we expect to see a shell drop right on to it . Although this incid onli last a few minut at least fifti shell must have been fire at it . All the time the shell was go on we could see the sailor work for dear life rais the anchor , and we heav a sigh of relief to see the anchor rais and the tug steam away into safeti . Dec 10th Frid . Our C.C.S. is fill up so rapid with sick now , that we anxious look for the hospit ship to come in . A shell land right on to the gun on the ridg abov us kill and wound all the gun crew . Warship bombard the Turkish posit veri heavili this forenoon . Even although these warship were three mile away the situat of the shot be fire seem to shake the who peninsular . One wonder how anyon or anyth could live after such a bombard as we have wit to-day . Dec 11th Sat . Stationari hospit got order to pull down and quit . This seem veri strang as they have been six week in put up their hospit and have done no hospit work whatev . Kept busi cart wood from the store up to the station .

In spite of the fact that there is such crowd , there is practic no nois . Mani rumour are afloat . Some say we are clear out but " I hae my doot " . What is the mean of this I cannot tell , but it is a bit upset . The prevail belief is that we are go to evacu this posit , and that our C.C.S. is to be the last Medic Unit to leav . Kept busi build a Shrapnel Shelter in case we got shell . The staion is now be kept empti of patient , they are be evacu almost as soon as they come in to the C.C.S. Pack my kit bag with onli the essenti thing to take away if rumour should be true . Dec 13th Mon Feel amongst us veri uneasi . The beach is veri quiet this morn . Remind me of earli on Sunday morn at home .

The Armi Ordnanc Store were open to all this forenoon and one could help themselv to all kind of new cloth . What is the use of it all to us . We can onli take what we can comfort carri and that is not much . It look now as if one will be lucki to get away with a whole skin .
