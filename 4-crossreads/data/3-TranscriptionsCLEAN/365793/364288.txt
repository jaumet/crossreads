  
 July 4 a beautiful avenue of fine old oaks, beeches & elms. Met 2 girls on the way home ? 
 5 The Lt. took us for a walk this morning , just a nice short one; we fell out had a smoke & a yarn, returned to the parade ground & then dismissed. Did a little fatigue, & after lunch went to Weymouth & was fitted out with an artificial eye. It's a little lighter than the other one but looks OK. Fred & I went for another walk along the avenue 
 6 Putting in for 10 days leave today &
