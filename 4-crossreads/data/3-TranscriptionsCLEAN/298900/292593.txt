  
 Thursday 20th December    I start this book, the 6th since enlistment in the midst of winter whilst out in rest in Cormont a quiet village of about 300 inhabitants almost 15 miles from Boulogne.   The war situation is stern, the enemy being strengthened by Russian withdrawal so that more of the burden is falling on Great Britain.   Americas advent is very welcome at this stage.   I expect to go to England on leave any day now being 3rd on the list & may be fortunate enough to be there for both Christmas & new year.   The weather is now cold, the frost remaining on the trees all day making a very pretty sight.   Had a busy time supplying the brigade with drugs otherwise nothing doing. 
 Friday 21st Dec    Nothing of importance doing & nothing new in the papers.   Went for a long walk during the afternoon to chase away some cobwebs. 
 Saturday 22nd Dec   Very anxious about my leave but do not expect to get it now until after Xmas;  I hope not as I do
