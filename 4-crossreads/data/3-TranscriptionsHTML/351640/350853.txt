<p>within few minutes pulled up &amp; I alighted at the entrance to the hotel.  I soon found Sister Draper and a friend. How do you do?   Glad to meet you in this land of Egypt!   What sort of voyage did you have and so on?  "Voyage! Do not mention it.   We came round the North of Australia.  The coolest part of the whole journey was in the Red Sea.  Near Colombo &amp; Aden we were nearly all killed with the heat.  The ship travelled 5 miles one day.   The firemen would not work.  Each 24 hours brought its troubles one way and another.   The same Captain and Chief Officer as when you were on board."</p>
<p>Sister Draper said:&ndash; "I called to see your daughters before leaving about the 13th of April.   They sent all sorts of sweet messages for you.  Desired me to say that they are all in the best of health and spirits.  I was also to give to you this small parcel.   And how have you been Colonel.   Looking much thinner than when we spoke together last.  Looking hard though.  We brought with us nurses from Victoria and New Zealand.   The ordinary episodes midst the women on board.  On the whole they were a good lot.  We learned before leaving that Col. Fiaschi is coming in charge of No. 3 General Hospital from Australia."<br/>Over some ginger ale &amp; lemonade we said much else about you, Sydney Macquarie Street, and of mutual acquaintances.</p>
<p>The Box: It had two one penny stamps on one side.  How so when it was delivered by hand from Australia to Egypt, Australian stamps of new design, &amp; each was obliterated with a postmark?   Must have been the stamps for an earlier delivery through the post.  My address and "Flowers only "on the box &amp; on a loose label.   Strange on the back of the label is a postmark "Sydney 23rd Feby 1915."   How so?   Must have been piece of an old label, used when the box was sent through the post.   Is't correct?</p>
