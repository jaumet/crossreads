detrained at Cassels at 2 P.M. Marched about 7 kilos along that curse of Flanders; a cobbled road, to billets near Ebblingham. Very stiff from being cramped in the trucks. A comfortable, fat land this, where I have been before. 
29/7/17.
Heavy storm this morning no Church Parade. Wrote letters. Billeted in a brick barn, a thing a man never sees in the Somme region where even the dwelling places are built of mud and straw plastered on sticks. Rare enough here too, so we appreciate it. Was paid yesterday.
August 1st. 1917.
Has rained for several days. Stayed in billets and wrote letters. Beer and eats are obtainable at this form so every thing is right.
