Sing me to sleep where the bullets fallLet me forget the War and allDamp is my dug out & Cold is my feetNothing but biscuits & bully to eatSing me to sleep where the bombs explodeAnd Shrapnel bursts are A La Mode.Over the sandbags helmets you findCorpses in front of you corpses behind
RefrainFar Far from Turkey I long to beWhere Turkish Snipers cant pot at meThink of me crouching where the worms creepWaiting for someone to sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep in some old shedWhere the fleas are jumping around my headStretched out upon my water proofDodging the rain drops through the roofSing me to sleep where the camp fires gleamFull of stale bread and "Cafe a L'eauSomebodies  Dreaming of home & nights in the WestSomebodies hob nail boots on my chest
RefrainFar from Gallipoli I long to beSights of old Sydney I'd rather seeThink of me crouching where the worms creepWaiting for someone to Sing me to sleepV E
