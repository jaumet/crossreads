<p>About 12 o'clock midday, we were standing about 2 miles out from Fremantle. The C.O. of the transport organised a concert on board in the evening. We spent a very pleasant evening; the lights of Fremantle showing up very finely.</p>
<p>News was quickly circulated, that we were going to visit Perth. That proved to be the case!</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, 29th October 1916, about 11.30. a.m, we were taken ashore in small steamers, to the quay at Fremantle. From Fremantle, we were carried by train to Perth, a distance of about 12 miles. The carriages were of a most antique type, but who cared!</p>
<p>We reached Perth about 12.15. p.m. We were now free to spend the time sight seeing. A friend and myself had dinner in Barrack St, Perth. We had a good look round the city, and its suburbs.</p>
