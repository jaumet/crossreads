<p>Dear Beat &amp; Family<br/>Just a line to say i am tip top i have not had five minutes sickness since i left . I have just come back from Cairo there are some prety sights there are some of the largest buildings i ever saw they are up as high as you like to look. Beat i got into some trouble last weak but i got out of it without a stain on my character i was sitting on the tram and one of the niggers said he would sell four oranges for one Piastre so i handed him the money and he only gave me three and made off but i jumped through the window and caught him and i hit him under the Jaw laid him out and when he came around they found his jaw was broke so the military police wanted to know what happened so i told them what happened and i had to give them my number and was paraded before the Kearnel next morning and got out of it. Beat i only wish i had a letter from you i get down hearted as i dont know how you are or the children or wheather you are receiving your money regular or not i would love to know if you have shifted or not you can tell Jess it is no use me writing to Billy because if you are still in Greta Jess will see all your letters you two Kecklers</p>
