<p>Monday 20 September, 1915</p>
<p>Crook again. Had to go down &amp; bring about 40 lbs of meat up the hill. This finished me.</p>
<p>Two men killed &amp; 6 wounded by one of our own bombs.</p>
<p>Things were very quiet, it has been a lovely warm day &amp; a bright moonlight night.</p>
<p>One of our destroyers lay out in the moonlight, right close to the shore, trying to tempt Beachy Bill to have a shot. As soon as he had he would have been blown sky high by a monitor carrying a 14&quot; gun &amp; lying right out to sea waiting to locate it by the flash but Mr Turk is too shrewd to fire at night &amp; give the position away.</p>
