<p>V<br/>in Cornwall on leave &ndash; Another officer of the 11th Bde was here, in fact two whom I knew very well.  Norman Bellamy &amp; Allan Gray, both of Cowra NSW.  They are going back to Aust permanently unfit &amp; they will be going to see you.  They are both rattling good chaps and Gray was in my Battery for some time.<br/>The 37th Battery is very much denuded since this last push, Capt (now temp Major) "Johnnie" Walker being the only remaining officer.<br/>Will write again in a few days when I may have an idea of the length of my sojourn here.<br/>With fondest love<br/>I am your affect Son<br/>Terence W. Garling</p>
