16.2.16 WednesdayFinished up at the Range to-day & through a mistake made on the mounds I & all the markers were nearly shot down.  The men started volley firing without orders from 500 yards range, before we were ready & we could only sit down & huddle up to the wall of the Trench until we got a spell so as to get our Flag & wave it.ome shots went through the framework & twisted Iron Bolts about, just as if they were paper.  I am saving one which was burst away about 1 ft from where I was.  However I managed to get the flag up & demanded an explanation which I have since received.The old Jack is coming down again to-night & his quaint sayings are quite refreshing to my ears.  I am trying to arrange for a day off so as to take him about a little.Will finish this now so as to write a further paragraph in your letter.
