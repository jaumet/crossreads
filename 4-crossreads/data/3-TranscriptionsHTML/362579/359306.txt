<p>My dearest Mother   &amp; Sisters</p>
<p>No letters this week from Aust. it seems ages since I last heard from home. Suppose shall have to wait patiently now. Anyhow no news is good-news.</p>
<p>The weather is delightful   &amp; everything is much brighter. I'm on Night-duty   &amp;  rather enjoying it, the work is very light   &amp;  the nights go by very quickly.</p>
<p>Our Sister-in-charge (Miss O'Dwyer) has been honoured with the R.R.C. (Royal Red Cross)</p>
