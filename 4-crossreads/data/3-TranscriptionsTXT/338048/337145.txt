 Tuesday 26th Revielle at 6.15 (what a change from 5 am) &amp; fooled about all day on fatigues &amp; getting camp in decent order. Continually tired today the last few days tearing around evidently requiring a little rest. 
 Wednesday 27th Mess orderly today but for a change was rather busy. Had a little time off to write. Rather wet day though the King inspected the 3rd Divisional and other Australian &amp; New Zealand men. There were 45,000 men inspected I believe &amp; there was a fine parade 
 Thursday 28th General fatigues clearing up again and nothing worth noting with exception of it being a fine day. Rumours re 4 days leave &amp; a move to France are becoming current. Writing in evening &amp; posted mail

 Saturday 30 Owing to being on horse picket I was not on first parade. Rest of the day holiday owing to sports. Walked to camp of German prisoners &amp; saw them building a road
