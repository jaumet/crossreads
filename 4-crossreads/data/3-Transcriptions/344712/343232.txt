<p>We left Sydney on the 26th of June 1915, arriving at Port Melbourne 2 days later at 4 p.m. when after taking on board more troops we re-sailed at 6 p.m.  After leaving that Port the only land visible to the eye of Australia was Cape Leuwin.  Nothing of note occurred crossing the Indian Ocean in fairly fine weather.  Crossing the Gulf of Aden land was sighted at times, and we passed some steamers of different types.  On entering the Red Sea the heat was terrific, and we had a close view of the Soudan and African Coast.  The sunsets in this sea, are the most beautiful I have seen, one being in particular worthy of mention.</p>
