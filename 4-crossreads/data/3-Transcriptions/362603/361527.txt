<p>2.  Ellis has gone off to Salisbury on the Bike.  He has to go on Duty to a neighbouring camp To-morrow so that He will not be Home to-night.  Ellis Dave &amp; I went to the theatre one night &amp; saw "Gipsy Love" played.  We get grand shows now.  The theatre is run by the Army &amp; they get the best Artists available.  We are having nearly all the good Comic opera's this Season.  How is the fruit this year.  I have had some lovely English fruit in Salisbury.  Pears Peaches &amp; apples &amp; also plums &amp; Tomatoes.  All English grown &amp; real good.  Blackberries are just beginning to ripen.  I anticipate some good feeds of them.<br/>Well Dad, I have to save some news for Mum &amp; George, so will say au revoir this time<br/>Your Loving Son<br/>Harry.</p>
