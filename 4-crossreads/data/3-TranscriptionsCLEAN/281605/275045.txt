  
 I had a week to wait for the 1 board & marked B.2 which meant a trip to England but had a wait of another week. I received orders on the 16.9.18 that I was to proceed on the long looked for journey & left camp at 2PM on that date by motor & was taken to the wharf at Le Havre. We embarked at 7PM on the Monas[t?] Queen & sailed at 11PM & after an all night voyage landed at Southampton at 8.30AM next morning. We then had to march to the Railway station & given three hours leave & it was great to feel the English air once more. We left by train at Midday & detrained at Weymouth where motors awaited us & was taken to Westham camp & fixed up for the night. Next morning I had to go before the doctor & was classified C11 & the same on the next day  & was drafted to No 4 Coy. I was finally boarded
