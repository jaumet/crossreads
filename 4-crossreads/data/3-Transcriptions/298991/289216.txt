<p>Saturday Sept 22nd<br/>Was paid thirty shillings today, &amp; my word I needed it too, as I was on my last penny. Went down to Portland this afternoon, it is a very quiet town though.</p>
<p>Sunday Sept 23rd<br/>We are having fine weather now. Was detailed for fatigue this morning but when we got on the job, we were not needed so we went for a walk round the rampart. There is some very pretty scenery around here. One very interesting part, was a seaplane rising &amp; alighting on the water. Went out &amp; got a few blackberries this afternoon, they weren't up to much though.</p>
<p>Monday Sept 24th<br/>A beautiful day. A boat roll of about 500 was called out today. I was not on it. Another one is expected out on Wednesday next. It was "L" boat roll, so I could not expect to be on it. I am expecting to be on "J".</p>
