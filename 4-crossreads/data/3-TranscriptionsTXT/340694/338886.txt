 We left Polygon Camp Abassia last Tuesday &amp; arrived here early Wednesday morning with difficulties facing us from the jump. The sand here is very fine &amp; the wagons sank nearly box deep in it. Extra horses had to be pitched on &amp; then numerous spells were necessary before the hard road was reached. The lead horses were then taken out &amp; returned to the Station
