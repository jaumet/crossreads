<p>Sunday 25th<br/>The Baloon moved on this morning.  D Co had another rough night. A prisoner was given to us to look after yesterday. It is a funnie old turn out. Of course there is no where to keep prisoners. And the only Sentry posted by day is up the hill at Headquarters &amp; the prisoner pokes about down here. He is a quiet little chap &amp; I think would be hard to chase away. He had to sleep in our Dugout &amp; it was rather overfilled but not uncumfortable I don't mean a Hun Prisoner  Returned in evening &amp; went back to Co</p>
<p>Monday 26th<br/>There were no empty dugouts so scratched a hole for my self in the Hill.</p>
