<p>My Battalion was in Poppy Valley which is open to view &amp; fire from Gabe Tepe for its whole length. On the afternoon of the day we left, (luckily they were not shelling us at the time &ndash; thought they used to strafe us with shrapnel at odd frequent &amp; uncertain intervals) turned left up a communication</p>
<p>3.<br/>trench &ndash; on entering which they were lost to view &ndash; into the Fire Trench &ndash; back down another communication Trench which when crossing Poppy Valley was sunk &amp; screened by bushes so that we could not be seen &ndash; out &amp; back into the Valley again at the point of commencement (as they say in a Conveyance). Each time we dropped or added 2 or 3 men, so that all friend Abdul saw was 3 or 4 squads of men about 25 strong each, going up to reinforce the Firing Line.</p>
<p>We left that night. We also left some farewell notes "Good-bye Abdul &ndash; meet you again some day". "You fought fair sorry we have to go" etc. We also left some gifts in the shape of booby-trap-bombs.</p>
