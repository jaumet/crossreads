Wednesday
Up at 8 a.m. breakfast, stand to all your meals. Wonderful what one can put up with. what he will eat when hungry. Still rain more mud. Do a little fatigue dinner consolidate our dugout. Line up at canteen in valley for hour for bottle sauce chocolates. mud. Transport difficulties. Tea scrap. Camp fire humping of logs. Song Hymns round fire before turning in.
