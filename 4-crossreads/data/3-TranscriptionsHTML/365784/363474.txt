<p>2.<br/>saying that they would be glad if they could put up a married couple for the time stated &amp; would they call the next after-noon &amp; take them away. They wrote back saying they would call at 2 sharp. Mr &amp; Mrs Turpin left home about 12 &amp; arrived at the Office to time. &ndash; The secretary was very sorry but Monsieur &amp; Madame had not yet arrived &ndash; would Mr &amp; Mrs Turpin kindly wait. They waited till about 3.30 &amp; then went out to get some tea &amp; said they'd return at 4. They did so &amp; shortly after enter the poor homeless poverty stricken Belgians. The man spoke English well, Madame only spoke French. Mr Turpin welcomed them, introduced his wife &amp;  suggested the two ladies should go off right away, while he &amp; the Belgian went for their luggage which was at their hotel. The man was immaculately dressed, like wise Madame who also wore most beautiful diamonds &ndash; he said "WE will get a taxi &amp; all go out together" Mr Turpin said "oh we can get a motor bus for 3d &amp; tram for 2d &amp; its really an hour &amp; a half's run so why waste money on a taxi, - surely you  &amp; I can carry the few clothes you'll need for four weeks".</p>
<p>At that Monsieur Belgique nearly exploded &ndash; he turned on the Secretary &amp; said "I told you I expected to be put up for the duration of the war &amp; this gentleman says for three weeks" &amp; then turned to Mt Turpin said "I expect to be housed till the war is over &amp; if you are not prepared to take us for that time, we would sooner stay at our Hotel" mentioning some fairly swagger Hotel &amp; went on to say that they had 20 trunks of personal effects as well as other boxes &amp; luggage &amp; altogether this  poor (?) refugee was most annoyed &amp; Mt Turpin said that as he was well enough off to stay at that hotel he had better continue doing so, &amp; the Belgians left in great dudgeon.</p>
<p>Then the Turpins said to the Secretary "have you no poor Belgian, some who if we dont take them will be homeless". He came back presently &amp; said "we want a home for a family of seven, but they won't be separated" so the Turpins said their home could'nt contain 7 extra &amp; the secretary said he was sorry, but apparantly he had no others needing help &amp; the left arriving back at Finchley about 7 pm, tired out &amp; feeling that they had had quite enough of Belgians.</p>
<p>Then I heard of some who were taken in by a family at Liverpool, &amp; after they had been there about 11 weeks butter went up, so these people bought salted butter for themselves, &amp; the Belgian family who had meals with them had to eat it too, &amp; the Belgians wrote to the London Headquarters, &amp; complained, &amp; when the English people found what they had done they wrote &amp; said they would'nt help them any longer &amp; they did'nt, &amp; on every hand in England are well authenticated cases like this &ndash; great strong able-bodied Belgians expecting to be kept &ndash; refusing to make their own beds or help wash up &amp; grumbling &amp; growling all the time &ndash; their habits are bestial &ndash; failing a handkerchief they use the curtains &amp; have other equally disgusting habits, &amp; I suppose in every hotel &amp; boarding-house in London &amp; fairly well off Belgians who don't give a penny to any charity fund &amp; don't do a hands turn for their own people. "We saved England" &ndash; let England keep us" is their whine.</p>
<p>And we Australians over here used to read of the thousands being subscribed by our people for Belgium, we used to gasp &amp; wonder if you were all dotty. What about funds for our own who will come back maimed &amp; crippled ? &ndash; what about money for the families of those who will never return ? &ndash; What about the starving poor in England to-day ?. Everyone we talked to at home took the war seriously &amp; alas too often did we hear the sad tale of "not enough amunition" &ndash; how frequently in letters from the front did we not read "after terrific fighting losses we took such &amp; such trenches, but had to fall back as the enemy's guns got our positions &amp; our artillery was unable to silence them" &amp; those who knew would say "ah, shortage of amunition again." One of my mothers cousins has a son in the artillery &amp; he was at Neuve Chapelle after that engagement, he wrote home &amp; said that if they had sufficient ammunition they could shell the Germans out of Belgium without the loss of another infantry man &amp; he also said they were given 50 rounds of amunition a day whereas the German battery opposite them had often fired 70 rounds before breakfast &ndash; &amp; of course its ancient history now that a lot of the wire entanglements were not shelled at all &amp; our poor men were held up by the cruel wires &amp; picked off like rabbits, not because the artillery failed, but because the amunition gave out.</p>
<p>On every hand in London are organisations for helping the Empire &amp; the supply of helpers is greater than the demand. Nancy Norris wrote to 7 Committees offering her services in any capacity, for any time, as a voluntary helper &amp; all refused as they were surfeited with offers of help.</p>
<p>About 70&percnt; of the men in London were in Khaki &amp; at night the streets were in semi darkness. At Bayswater only one lamp in fact was alight, but up the city there were even fewer lights &ndash; just one dim gas lamp at a street intersection &ndash; no head lights on motors &amp; no big electric lights &ndash; no arc lamps, all shop windows shrouded, &amp; at intervals a band of light crossing the sky &ndash; the search lights on different vantage points looking for the enemy in the air.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace, the Abbey, Parliament House, G. Post Office &amp; other important places looked like huge caged animals, being covered with a sort of scaffolding, with wire netting fixed over it &ndash; to keep bombs off &ndash; &amp; of course at all important buildings the armed guard on duty &ndash; sentries everywhere &amp; thro' it all, the ordinary "business as usual" Londoner carried on his work, as tho' there  were no such thing as Germans &amp; a life &amp; death struggle going on at his very door. &ndash; But the social life had changed &ndash; women who would usually be getting their frocks &amp; frill ready for the season were busy knitting &ndash; working for other.
