<p>38 Redfern Str.<br/>Redfern<br/>Thursday [1890]</p>
<p>Dear Arthur,<br/>It will save me some trouble, if you book me at central office to-morrow. I shall do the coaching business.</p>
<p>Perhaps the accommodation will devise between Murga and Eugowra: you will see both, and devise; and will not be too much allured either by the hotel fittings or natural advantages of scenery of either.</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>A.McManamey.</p>
