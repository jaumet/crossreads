Bde Hqrs in a motor lorry which took us to the sheds, here we hopped out a Scottish flying officer took charge of us took us among the planes, here he explained the working etc of the flares lamps, black white boards also how to send receive, it was a most interesting lecture, the majority of the planes in this aerodrome are monoplanes of the Morane type are French built 
After we had finished most of the boys cleared out went into La Houssaye, I nearly missed the car myself, just caught it in time, we then went into "Pont Novelle" had some dinner in a little caf there, left this place again about 1 oclock had a fairly fast run home
