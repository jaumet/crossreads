<p>these mails going to Davy Jones locker one gets so discouraged, it seems so useless to go pouring out stuff for nothing.  But if you felt like that &amp; didn't write where would we be.  So I go on.  I see you have had strikes &amp; things.  I'm sorry for you.  So much inconvenience &amp; annoyance.  Really one does get impatient &amp; exasperated with the brutes.  I really don't know whats coming to the world.  (Usual cry of the old &amp; out of date.)  I hope you haven't been sending anything lately, there have been some whole mails lost.  This isn't a hint.  Only please don't send any more.  I hate to think of you working away, making your eyes ache &amp; then for it to be all for nowt.  Just write to me <strike>now</strike> when you can &amp; when you feel like it.  I hope you haven't sent the MSC [manuscript ?] of the romance &amp; that it hasn't gone down.  I've felt so bumpy all today, one gets so fed up.  The weather is really pestiferous to a degree, the whole district is a very messy &amp; dirty bog.  It rains every day &amp; every night.</p>
<p>The skeeters are quite prime ones &amp; love me.  I have seen Joe Kirby again, I hear he has been recommended for the Military Cross.  I hope so.</p>
