<p>Kitcheners staff and on the Hampshire when the she went down.  This friend had been wearing Widow's weeds for 6 months/her Husband being reported drowned!  When she received a few lines from him saying "I am well don't worry There are 14 of us here I can say no more good-bye".  There always had seemed to be some mystery attached to LK death.</p>
<p>23rd  The rumours have started again and the latest one is that we are going to France.  If we are needed there well that is all &ndash; that is what we came out for but the effects of it all here satisfy me without getting any nearer &ndash; Naturally its one long long for it to be all over and no one more so than you in Aus who are so far away.</p>
<p>You'll be I am off letter writing &ndash; please forgive this &ndash; the secret of it must be that there is depression in England but things look brighter since Mr Lloyd George came into office.</p>
<p>With ever so much love<br/>Sincerely Yours<br/>Anne Donnell.</p>
<p>PS  Whenever I picture the coming on of the day staff &amp; the going off of the night/morning I cannot help laughing.  Fancy women not being able to walk without falling down &ndash; Such was the fact and some fell down several times -  We weren't prepared to walk on glassy ice &ndash; but twas another experience &amp; tonight they are walking with socks over their boots.  The boys went to parade as usual but fell down in the attempt &ndash; so it was Ma feast parade.</p>
