<p>July 1917<br/>unpleasant enough.  Go for a ride occasionally through &amp; round Ismailia  It is very nice of an afternoon riding through the avenues of trees.  Also visited the town baths.  They consist only of a row of boxes built on a jetty.  Most of the European residents have their private boxes along the front of the lake.  Later in the afternoon it presents quite a continental picture with all the different costumes  There are crowds of Tommies here now  They seem a pretty good lot &amp; have just come from Salonica &amp; are having a few weeks spell here.  The Lake is full of them in the afternoons.  They march down in Battalions,<br/>The aerodrome is alongside our camp.  They get busy very early in the morning &amp; it sounds like 20 chaff cutters going.  An Australian mail, letters &amp; papers arrived during the week   Got 3 letters 2 from home!  Answered them all</p>
<p>Wednesday July 4th to Tuesday 10th<br/>Have sent a number of men out to the Regt during the week.  Numbers of Tommies are still going through here  Went into Ismailia 2 or 3 times &amp; called</p>
