Plenty of them about here & they don't appear in the distance to be smashed but suppose they are. if the huns make a big counter attack tonight into it we go & as the fighting is awful God knows if you will come out of it  alive. The Big guns about 400 yds away are kicking up blazes & the others are like machine guns. 
 Tuesday 8/5/17 Rained all night, slept in tents, woke up this morning swimming for dear life inside as wet as outside So got up & did what we should have done yesterday, dug a trench (fastening the stable door after the horse got out). Owing to the rain there wasn't much doing but the guns are still banging away. Pay. 9/1. 25.3.0. Rained all the morning & of course nothing but mud again. Hot as blazes yesterday, cold to day. off to the line this evening, guns going it
