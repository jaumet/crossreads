March 1918
MessinesReally, a fairly busy day, aeriel activity having first place, and artillery next. Seemed as if Fritz was preparing for a little stunt - poor old Fritz what a shock he will get. Knipe - alias Lightning arrived at P-t with Percy Grayling to relieve Garfott, yesterday. Big fatigue party working about the line, they seem pretty busy. Shells fell in several co-ordinated spots fairly handy, one did a little damage. Paid Geo Baker and Mick a visit during evening.
