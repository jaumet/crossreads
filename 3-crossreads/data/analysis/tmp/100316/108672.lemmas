 Yarn with Colonel Traver for a long time . Heard a furphi that Capt . Hunter had die of his wound . This lack confirm as yet . Thewli came down from the line first and one could see that he was tire out . I sent up a limber to bring out the captur M.g 's . and other trophi . All the chap came down veri late and quit tire out with their experi . Old Habel had a good dinner readi for them and they were soon all chatter about the number of Hun they had kill and all their experi of blood . A frequent remark was on the callous of mani of the men . A rather critic situat was save by Abercrombi and other on the left of A Co where their flank got well up in the air and some faintheart start to go back . A bayonet sent after them persuad them that safeti lay forward prove a good thing . Our star seem to have been Sergeant " Rusti " Ruthven whom I intend to recommend for a V.C. Madden is also said to have done good work . Smith was in charg of a limber full of machin gun which we sent down and we also brought out a minnen werfer gun . Turn in after yarn with Matthew just as day broke
