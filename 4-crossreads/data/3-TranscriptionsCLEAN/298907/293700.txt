  
 sun was to be seen. 
 25th. This afternoon two other chaps & I having an invitation from Mr Jervis who offered to take us round the Park & back home to his place for tea, slipped down to Hagley Road terminus where we were to meet, to tell the truth I did not like the idea of going at first & I wanted to back out, but he seemed so keen on my coming that eventually I went, & I'll say right here that I was never so glad that I went as I was today, they met us sharp for he had brought his daughter a jolly fine girl, & it was no time before she & I tailed off & were yarning like as if we knew one another for years we both had a topic in common namely photography
