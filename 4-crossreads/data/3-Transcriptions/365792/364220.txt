<p>May 15 Walked through lanes &amp; byways down towards the town &amp; then explored St Josephs Cathedral. Sorry I couldn't get up top, but all the same the lower part is beautiful &amp; was well worth any trouble. Round 2 sides of the church &amp; some distance from it runs a wide shady walk hemmed in on both sides by stout brick walls. From the top of the outer wall (which is 5 ft thick in one place) one can look out over the city below. Alongside the wharves were scores of fishing boats, (mostly sailors) &amp; several liners &amp; a Hospital ship. On one part of the wharf was a mine about 3 ft in diameter, which had been raked out of the Channel. Trains &amp; trams were everywhere (almost as common as soldiers). Weighed myself 75 Kilos &amp; then had a look inside the Post office.</p>
<p>16 Woke up during the night to the accompaniment of bombs &ndash; evidently from enemy aircraft. Am not going before todays board</p>
