Mother 2. 9 Letters today Aunt Louie (2), Days &amp; others from England &ndash; Joe.  Went to Bakeries Napoleon used them &amp; before that they were a slave market, there's 5 of those ovens like a row of Shearers Brick ones. 40,000 Loaves daily are turned out we eat Australian frozen mutton &amp; Beef &ndash; The flour comes from America Butter from Australia.
