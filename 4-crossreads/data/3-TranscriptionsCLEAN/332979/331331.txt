  
 for I hour we will have another hour of Daylight. After Breakfast 2 Chums & myself went for a stroll as the morning was beautiful, the Sun was shining & the air cool. I enjoyed a walk along the Wood until Dinner time. After Dinner I took my Chum for a long walk to Headley, as this place to my mind is very interesting I enjoy the walk. My Chum was very much taken up with the Village especially the Old Church which I am informed that the Tower portion is over 400 years old & the Beams supporting the Roof originally came from an old Barn. This Church was burnt down & rebuilt. On coming back I took a short cut which landed into private Property & on apoligising to the Owner
