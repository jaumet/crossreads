<p>16.2.16 Wednesday<br/>Finished up at the Range to-day &amp; through a mistake made on the mounds I &amp; all the markers were nearly shot down.  The men started volley firing without orders from 500 yards range, before we were ready &amp; we could only sit down &amp; huddle up to the wall of the Trench until we got a spell so as to get our Flag &amp; wave it.<br/>ome shots went through the framework &amp; twisted Iron Bolts about, just as if they were paper.  I am saving one which was burst away about 1 ft from where I was.  However I managed to get the flag up &amp; demanded an explanation which I have since received.<br/>The old Jack is coming down again to-night &amp; his quaint sayings are quite refreshing to my ears.  I am trying to arrange for a day off so as to take him about a little.<br/>Will finish this now so as to write a further paragraph in your letter.</p>
<p>17.2.16 Thursday<br/>Went out on a route march to-day &amp; enjoyed it after putting in a week</p>
