<p>My dear Judge,</p>
<p>With any good luck we should manage to spend a fairly decent quiet Christmas well out of the line.  Unless something unexpected happens we should be out in good comfortable billets for a considerable time.  At present we are in a good hutment camp just behind the line training, doing fatigues and "resting".</p>
<p>For the first time since we have been in France we have managed to fix up a decent hut where all the officers can meet together &amp; have a bit of enjoyment.  We have had a good many changes lately and it is a good opportunity to learn to know some of the new fellows coming in.</p>
<p>I am busy arranging for the taking of the Military Service Referendum Vote.  As far as it is possible to judge I think the vote in this division will be a 'Yes'.  It is rather hard to know how far one is entitled to try to influence the men.  Soldiering &amp; politics of course don't mix well together but I think the men are wanting to put the thing through.  The proposal by the government appears to be mild enough anyway.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to Brigade to meet</p>
