9 September 1918 MondayWent Jerusalem to sit on a Board of Enquiry into the loss of 400/-/- Cash stolen from AIF Canteen-Road very dusty & "Jericho Jane" amused herself by firing long range shots with her naval gun into Jericho-  Camping near Railway Station at Reinforcement Camp was like a Miller on arrival from the Dust-  Will be up here for 3 days I expect a nice cool change-
