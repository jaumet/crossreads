At dinner time to-day Major Granville told Sergeant Mack to call for two volunteers to go up the valley between the Turk trenches & our own.  Fletcher & I volunteered, we are to go after dark & do not know yet what we are to go for.  We went into the trenches at 4 o'clock to relieve the men now in 24 hours in the trenches & 24 out is the daily "menu" here.  Soon after going in Maj. Granville & Lieut. Kater came along & gave instructions of what we had to do after dark in Dead Mans Gully, we have to explore it &
