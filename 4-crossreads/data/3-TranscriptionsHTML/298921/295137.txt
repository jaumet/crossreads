<p>June, 1915<br/>Tuesday 15<br/>I note what Joe says about Wangaratta, no doubt he'll get a job some day, J.A.C. has not seen fit to send me any Testimonial to date. Capt Max Henry Vet Officer is in the same Mess as I am here.<br/>This war will not end for some time is the general opinion. The Papers you get do not publish the full list of casualties they nearly all occurred the first fortnight &amp; are being published in instalments for very good reasons no doubt.</p>
