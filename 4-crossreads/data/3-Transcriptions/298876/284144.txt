<p>Friday<br/>3/3/16</p>
<p>Fairly cool day &ndash; Sea just like a pond &ndash; About the only startling thing today was the number of new Mumps patients &ndash; Both Hospitals full up.</p>
<p>One fellow gave us a lot of trouble all night &ndash; right off his head &amp; couldn't take our eye off him.</p>
<p>The Y.M.C.A people have a representative on Board to distribute literature, writing material etc &ndash; also preacher &amp; is very popular. This fact reminds me very forcibly that the Red Cross people ought to take a hint of go thou &amp; do likewise &ndash; I have not one bad thought or word about the Red Cross its ends etc. &ndash; but I do really say the stuff they handle from their own efforts &ndash; gifts &ndash; patriotic &amp; otherwise &amp; more especially as they are so careful as to checking packing etc that their stuff is not distributed as should be to the very best advantage or cases &ndash; very often a lot of their stuff goes into</p>
