<p>Neutrals</p>
<p>When the job seems rough &amp; risky<br/>And you've got no rum or whisky<br/>Keep on smilin', smilin' smilin'<br/>Till you're like a currant Bun<br/>And the Huns they nearly shell yer'<br/>Bloomin Taubes they try &amp; fell yer<br/>Keep on smilin', smilin, smilin<br/>Till you're like a bullocks yoke<br/>Cause the Huns they know were martyrs<br/>Not real soldiers only carters<br/>Bad the 'uns they show real pity<br/>for the purely neutral Bloke</p>
