26/2/18 Selles
Up early and saw A.Co off to the Lottinghen rifle range, Then met the Coy Commanders at my billet at 9 a.m. and discussed the Battalion tactical scheme with them. We rode out to the ground above Quesques ? a pleasant ride and a lovely morning. Went over the ground and allotted the frontages c. We then met the Battalion in column of route with the Band and marched through ESCOUEVILLES out on to the main road to Corlettes. This is a splendid National Road and straight as a die. We went right through the wood before Corletttes and pulled up for lunch on a green field
