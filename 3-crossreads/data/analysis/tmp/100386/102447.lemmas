In the Dardanell campaign the unit was at one time reduc to 44 men through sick and quit a number of them ill . Yet they stuck it and the same amount of Ration were bake each day . When we first commenc oper at Imbros , Water had to be carri half a mile in Camp Kettl and in the dark of night men would get near camp fall in a ditch and have to return .
