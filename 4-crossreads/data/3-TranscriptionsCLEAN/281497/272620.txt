  
 25th The bombardment continued all night & never let up as yet, I had a terrible narrow shave & shock early this morning, myself & Bob Creasy were lying in 2 dugouts almost touching one another I was almost asleap, & was dreaming of home, when all of a sudden a terrific roar & I found myself all dazed lying in the trench a shell had exploded without a lie not 5 ft from my head but just above it, it wounded poor Bob Creasy I bandaged him up he was hit in the head, chest, & nose I think he will get over it alright. 
 I think the shelling is even worse today than yesterday
