Delville Wood & Frontline (N. of Flers) 17/11/16 for me to take command of the 24th Battn with Captain Elwood as Adjutant and move with a full fighting company and 4 Lewis guns to Bde H.Q. there to pick up guides for the front line trenches.  Packed hurriedly a few things and got over to 24th H.Q. and had a bite of tea and set off fully laden at 4 pm when it was growing quite dark.  The men followed behind having been recalled post haste from fatigue work and the poor devils were very tired.  Pushed on through Delville Wood and soon struck the duckboards and reached B.H.Q who are located in a set of very fine 30 feet deep dugouts.  The interior looked like a commercial office with telephonists and others and the General was sitting there in a sheepskin vest and gave me my orders.  With aides went across to B.H.Q and found them similarly located and then commenced to go up to the front line mostly to my surprise by very fine trenches. Usually impassable on account of mud they had frozen hard and the going was quite good. We fell over many times but plugged ahead and soon came to a place where it was necessary to freeze into stillness and from here on we encountered the brave dead lying where they had fallen.  Eventually we plunged into a trench and found the 27th Batt. H.Q not at all a bad dugout and Col. Slane was there.  The digging of a new trench by his men was in progress and I did not take over until this was complete some hours after.  A Corporal shot through the eye was our first wounded and the Engineer officer was next shot through the back.  The enemy are 40 yards from here and their flares fall well over us.  A few shells kept whining overhead but on the whole the show was fairly quiet.  Snatched a little fitful sleep.  Sigs in communication right through to the General.  They are good lads & it's fine work.
