<p>Sunday July 8, 1917. (1070)<br/>I was on picquet this morning from 12 to 3, there was a very heavy &amp; continuous bombardment nearly all night. A storm came on &amp; there was very vivid flashes of lightening around the sky, and in the morning the rain was coming down in torrents &amp; the river Douve running a banker.<br/>I was shepperding horses this morning.

It is reported that Colonel Smith is leaving the Battalion on account of differences with the Brigider , &amp; that the second in command will fill his place.

In fact yesterday &amp; to day there has been a lot of comment on the unusual quietness. I was on 2 picquets last night from 9 to 12 &amp; to night a picquet from 6 to 9.<br/>I put on a pair of shoes on a mule to day, &amp; removed the straw binding that was put on the wheel hubs a few weeks ago.<br/>I was paid 20 francs to night equal to 14/8</p>
