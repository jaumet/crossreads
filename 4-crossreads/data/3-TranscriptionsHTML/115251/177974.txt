<p>The foodstuffs which are on the Steamer under the British Flag, shall be for the Natives of New Mecklenburg, who are in urgent need of it.&nbsp; The Administrator promised that the food would not be kept for the Troops.&nbsp; It is therefore requested that the cargo shall go to the destination in New Mecklenburg without interference.</p>
