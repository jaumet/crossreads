 Rained heavy all night. Got orders to march up the line again at 5 am - only a rumour we are not disappointed, we all would have preferred to have stayed in, than be humbugged so. Took post near firing in a sunken road on the left of Riencourt, about 11 am. Rained off & on. Fritz sniping at us with rifles as we came over, he got in about 7 or 8 shots before we took a tumble, we thought first they were bits of shrapnel.
