 The Campaign in Palestine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C.D.": In what follows I claim no credit for myself in the slightest. I did my "tap," but the glory of the Egyptian campaign is to the regimental officers and men of the mounted troops. Between February, 1916, and March, 1917, these men were hardly ever 48 hours without a scrap of some kind, and sustained 83 per cent. of the casualties. The infantry's work in Egypt has been to guard the Canal: that of the Light Horse has been to drive the Turk across 200 miles of desert. You hear now of the fine railway through Sinai. It is a feat of which we are proud, and so we are of the water-pipe; but neither was possible until the desert for miles ahead was cleared of the Turks. Our boys were the pioneers, and as such were always 10 to 30 miles beyond the railhead. How many realise what that means? Observation posts by day beneath a blistering sun; lonely outposts by night; patrols; constant skirmishing and scouting. Most of the work was done by night, and what the awe of the desert is only those who have experienced it know. Every inch of the way from the Canal to Gaza was first crossed by our Light Horsemen, the Maoriland Mounted Rifles and the British Yeomanry, and never once did they lose a fight or suffer a surprise. But they had to pay the price, and the shortage of the regiments explains why the men have practically never had a spell. In France, too, they have the advantage of a superior air-service, which our boys certainly have not. Our fastest 'planes in June were 90 miles per hour and the enemy's poorest were 120. You don't need to be a military genius to see what that means.
