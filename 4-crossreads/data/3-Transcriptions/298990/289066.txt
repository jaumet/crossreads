<p>Montauban &amp; Longueval 7/11/16  In the early hours searchlights and anti-aircraft guns were extremely active and it was said later that a Zeppelin had passed over.  An incessant cannonade in progress always &ndash; if not on our immediate front then on either flank.  Some very heavy guns spoke at intervals.  Bitterly cold morning and Bazeley and myself lay in blankets talking for a long time until our batmen brought in our dinner.  We got up about 9 and thanked God we were not in the trenches with the rest of the Battalion.  It started to rain about 10.30 and continued steadily after that.  The long strings of mules with packs of rations and ammunition continued to pass as usual the drivers muffled up and miserably soaked to the skin.  Sledges were in use across the mud flats instead of limbers.  Lines of mules in a transport line opposite this tent &ndash; standing dejectedly in the cold and slush.  The guns take no holiday on account of wet but fire as usual thus adding to the discomfort of Fritz.  He does not send back 1/6th of the shells we fire at him and in this respect operations here differ from those at Pozieres.  Our tent commenced dripping having become quite saturated.  "God help the poor devils in the trenches!"  From here I can send telephone messages right through to the CO.  Delville Wood has great festoons of wire from tree to tree and in places posts carry dozens of artillery wires.  Many are old broken ones.  All across country wires (mostly D's) lie on the surface and trip one up if not heedful of them.  Hogarth and others reported back in the afternoon and set off for the trenches.  Heavy continuous rain set in.  With a brazier we managed to get comfortable.  Hunt returned from A1lbert with no better results than two French newspapers.  In spite of the tempestuous elements our gun fire showed no slackening.  No shells near us here.</p>
