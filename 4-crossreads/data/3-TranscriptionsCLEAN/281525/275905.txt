There were crowds towards the Bois walking up and down - the gayest dresses and uniforms. Nursemaids with kids, soldiers and officers of all the nations airmen and naval officers. Each with his lady - an animated spectacle. In spite of a chilly fog the ladies wear open necked dresses. Dogs clad in boots and rugs - ridiculous. Returned to hotel about midday and then went up to the Cafe de la Paix for lunch afterwards to the Opera Comique. "Amoreux de Catherine" preceded the "Roi de Yys" the music and acting in the latter very fine and much better than "Werther". The excessive politeness of the French is very noticeable at a place like this - the bowing and apologies. The claque or paid applauders was very noticeable at the Folies
