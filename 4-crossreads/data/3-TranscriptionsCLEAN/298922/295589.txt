  
 Friday 5th October 1917 
 Still on board, a week today - but we hope to disembark at noon - travelling is not easy in War time  & the      YELLOW JACK makes it more difficult.  
 5 miles by Tug to a Rest Camp then we carried our own luggage to the train with rations & water. Got off at 8 p.m. 5 Officers in a compartment. I slept on the floor. All along Adriatic Coast the same foliage as Peninsular viz., Olives, etc. Women on duty at Cross roads & in the fields.
