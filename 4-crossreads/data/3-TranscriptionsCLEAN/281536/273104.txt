For the men the same as well as cards and the band playing. Quite a number of the officers are off color with bad throats. Long grey rolling seas in the evening and sometimes a school of bonitos. Bed 8 pm. 
 23/7/19 A dull windy cool day. Rose at noon. a bunch of fine bad characters have meeting place outside my cabin window and sitting on the deck regale me with their crimson language - unconscious of being heard. There are useful titbits of news gleaned this way. Dancing on the promenade deck until 9.
