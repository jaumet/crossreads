Theirs an immortal fame,The deathless name of AnzacThat thrills from Pole to Pole,The remnants of the heroesOn the long & glorious Roll.And now in their tens of hundredsCome the men to fill their ranks,And what can we do to show themOur love, our pride, & our thanks?We can't do much (I own it),But give them a passing cheer,While the real Elite beat a shocked retreatWhy, they saw one drinking beerOh God, Could we show these misersThe path that the Anzacs went,Could they rest in their beds at night time?Or sleep in their damd contemp?Could they talk with a sneer of AustralianWhen one or two get drunkI'd rather a drunk Australian
