 Aout 4 Nos 2 &amp; 4 Sec. had route march in morning through Blaringham &amp; Ebblinghem &ndash; about 9 miles. 
 Aout 5 No. 2 Sec. Duty sec. today &amp; most of us got leave to St Omer. I am writing in the garden or park there now &amp; listening to a Welsh band. Gardens appear to be very nice &amp; there &amp; there appear to be a heterogenious crowd gathered. Military &amp; civilian Australians including nurses making things look quite gay with their red capes. There also are French English &amp; Portuguese soldiers &amp; other varieties &ndash; officers of apparently all nationalities &amp; rank. To my way of thinking the best of all are the Australians &amp; Jocks. The Australian nurses are very plain of feature but they are a little bit of  home . The Welsh band's mostly  music  but not very enjoyable. Had tea &amp; returned back to billet arriving about 9p.m.
