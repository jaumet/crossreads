 While were fighting for the nation, in our Present situation, Weve example in the good old common mud, For it sticks with desperation, and makes quite a decoration Till a soldier man looks something like a spud When you meet an old relation, and he starts the conversation, It's the same - unless you nip it in the bud - For we curse the whole creation for its slimy old foundation, Drives a man to Aviation - does the mud - When with frantic jubilation, we shall hail the fermentation Of the war, then e'en forgetting.
