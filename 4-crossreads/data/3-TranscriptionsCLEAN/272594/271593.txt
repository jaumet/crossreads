Orderly Sergt up to me to give me the tip to have my lines clear for old Pearce was blowing them all up, so he is trying to square  me, but he & I will never agree & if he gets snaky again I will ask to be paraded to the Colonel & state my grievances to him & ask to be relieved of my duties  I'm full up of being bounced about by these men who have never seen a shot fired in anger.
