Albert has been fine place but owing to being under enemy shell fire so long it has been knocked about considerably but not beyond repair. It has a fine railway service & the most noticeable thing at present is the catheral spire with its overhanging monument which lies at a degrees of 120 & leans right out across the main road. There are at present a few civilians but it is used a lot by the military.

Bapaume has been a fine big place but like all other French towns & villages its buildings are jammed up close together. Now it is one big heap of debris owing to the willful distruction of the huns before their evacuation. Since the British military authorities have occupied it they have had it cleaned up the & all the roads & thoroughfares repaired & put into good working order.
