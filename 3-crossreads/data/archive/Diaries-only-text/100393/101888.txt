Nothing in particular happened that night except that five of us about 2 A.M. started back to get rations and got lost. Took us until daylight to find our way back to the front line again and without the rations. Someone else had, however, brought them up. Some breakfast had been brought up about 6 A.M. We eat it and the carriers went back again to Company H/Qrs. Then
Sept 11.
about 7 A.M. "A" and "D" Companies made a very game advance. They were very few men. It was broad daylight, open flat ground. They had very little artillery with them. 
They advanced about 1000 yards and met very strong opposition.
Soon after their advance the Germans made a heavy bombardment on us which lasted about 3 hours heavily kept going not so heavily until about midday. It inflicted a lot of casualties and some very good men were killed here. He The Germans were not to get off scot free however for the next night. 
Sept 12
"B" and "C" Companies went out took the 1000 yards with very little opposition. Each platoon had covering patrols. I was one of the patrolling party and we had very little trouble. Pioneers came up and dug in for us and the next morning found us a good way ahead of our position the previous of day.

Things were now fairly quite quiet and the next night we were relieved by the 7th Aust. Battn.
