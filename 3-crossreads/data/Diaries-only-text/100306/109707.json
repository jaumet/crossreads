Shelter Wood Camp X21d7.4
14/2/17 Slept in until after noon. Dressed and had lunch and spent rest of the day quietly. At 4 p.m. inspected our 110 new reinforcements and made a short speech to them. General was in for a talk later.
15/2/17 Spent quietly in camp, the men all going down to the baths and cleaning up generally. Some Taubes over during the morning and from our anti-aircraft guns some dud shells fell close round the camp. In the evening walked up with the doctor to the baths. Noticed odd graves everywhere with their little wooden crosses. What a vast army of scattered dead.
16/2/17 In camp. All men on parades drill and specialist training and I put the acid on quite a number of people from Coy. Commanders down. Big ammunition dump blew up at 5 a.m. and explosions kept occurring frequently. Otherwise a quiet day. To a man who failed to rub his feet properly got bad feet I awarded 28 days F.P. No 2 and reduced his Corporal to the ranks. Concert in evening.
