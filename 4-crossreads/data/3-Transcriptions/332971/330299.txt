<p>15th  The unexpected has happened.  As I am about to return the Night Super comes in &ndash; hands me a warrant for London and tells me that Matron has given me my holidays from tomorrow but I may, if I like, travel today &amp; try &amp; catch up the party.  Truly I feel my star is in the ascendant.  I am sorry to leave my friend Sister Davis &ndash; who is experiencing the very trying stage of patiently waiting.  She is to be married as soon as her lover gets his leave but that uncertainty combined with the irregularity of the mails is very trying.</p>
<p>On reaching the Ivanhoe in London I learn that the girls had left by the early train for Dublin.  The next goes at 8.45pm and means all night travelling but I decide to go by it &amp; in the meantime go to Miss Conyers for a free pass (return) to Belfast.  Being tired for want of sleep I feel somewhat timid about travelling alone but make up my mind that good fortune will be with me &ndash; so it was &ndash; for on entering the 1st class carriage theres the nicest Irish Sister in uniform who is familiar with the journey.  She is going home on short notice to be married ere her lover leaves for France.  I put myself in her trust and sleep soundly until awakened at Holyhead at 2am to Change for the Sea journey &ndash; then mines &amp; sub-marines are soon forgotten in Sleep until daylight when we are at the Emerald Isle.  As we are waiting in the train to take us up to Dublin Sister is anxious that I should see Davy Stephens &ndash; the famous newspaper seller ad the best known man in all Ireland "She says I purchase a book on the life &amp; times of Davy and really it is most interesting.  He is 78 years old now &ndash; And for over 60 years has attended the arrival &amp; departures of the Mail Steamer to &amp; from Kingstown</p>
