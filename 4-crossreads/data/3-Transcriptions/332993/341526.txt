<p>and continued it at intervals throughout the day evidently in search of guns. Some of the shots were quite close to our lines<br/>I saw one of our baloons come down this afternoon. It collapsed and gently fell to the earth. The aviator jumped out in a parachoote. The baloon must have bursed caused either by the valve blown out, or the gas expanding with the heat of the sun, or a bullet or shrapnel striking it.<br/>The Battalion sports were continued this afternoon and the various heats run off.<br/>The Russians have captured 18,000 men, 300 officers, &amp; 29 guns. This is a brilliant victory for General Brusiloff. The French have also great success on a 13 mile front, &amp; the Italians have inflicted reprisals on Trieste. I saw the daily "Sketch" &amp; "Express" today, the price is now 2 1/2d. Enemy U. boats attacked American Transports in the Atlantic without success. At least one U. boat was sunk.<br/>I finished reading a book "Heroes &amp; heroic deeds of the Great War", by Donald A. Mackenzie.</p>
<p>Saturday July 7. 1917 (1069.)<br/>A fine day, cool fresh breeze.<br/>I was on picquet this morning from 3 to 6.a.m. There was a very heavy bombardment last night. This afternoon the Transports had a half holiday &amp; with others I went to Bailleul. It is about 4 miles away and we walked down the railway line and came back in a Transport cart. The town is not as large or so beautiful as Armentieres, nevertheless there are some fine shops &amp; buildings. The night before Fritzs planes dropped a lot of bombs &amp; some fell on a Hospital &amp; killed &amp; wounded a lot of patients &amp; some of the staff. I got post card views of some of the chief sites in the town. Beer is 3 &frac12; first glass. All foods</p>
