<p>Dear Mrs Vernon<br/>Thank you very much for the parcel of summer clothing which came to me quite safely and in good order some few days ago.</p>
<p>They were indeed very welcome and some of the lads who had just come in from hospital were very glad indeed to have some of them.</p>
<p>we are grateful to the 1st A.L.H. Comforts Depot for many things sent on from time to time.</p>
<p>I am  yours sincerely<br/>Walter Long.</p>
