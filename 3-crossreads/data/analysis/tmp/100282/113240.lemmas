 here first . My spell over here has done me the world of good I feel in first class form , though I ca n't say as how I am look forward to the come winter especi Novemb Decemb for they are so wet cold , but who know but that I may get a nice littl Blighti get right out of it . 24th And still here go tomorrow now I believ , if there is anyth I hate it is hang about , like we are do at present . I got quit a littl surpris this morn when I took my old platoon over for the day , when I walk out on to our parad ground all the lad cheer me it was quit genuin , they were glad to have me back after the chap who had been in charg dure my absenc . I had no idea they thought that much of me , for as a rule most chap ca n't stand me at first , they say it take quit a while to understand me
