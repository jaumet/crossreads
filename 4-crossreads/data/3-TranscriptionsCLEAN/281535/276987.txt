  
 3/6/19 London A very busy day. Found in "Times" that a C.M.G had come to me so made for tailors and had it sewn on. Then to the Bank and then down to Buckingham Palace where a crowd had already assembled to see a march past. Saw Queen Mary, the Princes, Queen Alexandra drive up and then the head of the column of troops came in sight having left Hyde Park where the colours had been trooped. The massed bands in full glory looked very fine preceded by their drum majors. The King rode behind them escorted by the Prince of Wales and Duke of Connaught. Sir Douglas Haig came later and got a good reception from the people. The Guards then marched past. Lunched at the old Cock Tavern and went to Horseferry
