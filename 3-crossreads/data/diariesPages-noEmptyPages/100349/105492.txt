Dropped down the stream yesterday and anchored in the sound. We make up a convoy including the "Carriers" BB (Durham Castle) B.2 (Dunvegan Castle) and a Newzealand ship "Remura". There are 16 ships at anchor here. Saw many warships including one of the mysterious "Hush"! ships. Mad March weather, windy and cold. We are very comfortable on this ship, the tucker is exellent. We are waiting to make up a convoy, do not know when we sail.
16/3/18.
We sailed from Plymouth at 4.30 P.M. A convoy of 7 ships, with an escort of 3 cruisers, one American, and many destroyers, one balloon, and a seaplane. A fine sight. A splendid clear fine night we passed Eddystone light at 6 P.M. No lights are visible in the convoy. At last we are really homeward bound.
