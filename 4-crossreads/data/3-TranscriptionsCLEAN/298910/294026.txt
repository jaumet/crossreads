  
 on the Town of La Vinte, where the 59th & our artillery are billeted, it is only 1/4 of a mile in front of us. 3 stretcher Bearer squads from each section moved out to the trenches at V C Cutting. A woman in the Village had collar bone broken by anti air guns & came to our Station to be dressed - Sailly show signs of the Huns unfortunately - A Great number of the inhabitants are still in the Village at their own risk. We took over operations from the 13th F. Ambulance today, they are due at Ypres - Had to tear the Cross & Brassard off our arms - so we have no protection at all. I for one will shoulder a rifle straight away, if the Geneva Convention cannot give better protection. Men are wounded in the trenches here in the morning & at sunset they are on the way to London - Some very stirring air duels immediately near us - Immediately our planes get near their lines for observation purposes they open fire & can safely say they fire hundreds of shells at each plane & there are dozens of planes & yet they say the Germans are short of ammunition, most of the shootings is rotten.
