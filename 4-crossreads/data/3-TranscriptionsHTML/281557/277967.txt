<p>Continued     (4) How I won the V.C.</p>
<p>Just a bayonet stab through the gizzard<br/>&amp; a crack from a bullet ot two.<br/>But I nerved my strength for the conflict<br/>&amp; just as the darkness came down<br/>I was under their parapet resting<br/>&amp; knew I had beaten them brown.<br/>For this was the scheme I had worked on<br/>Twas a little bit mean you will say<br/>But I knew that the turks were half famished<br/>&amp; fought on a biscuit a day.<br/>&amp; the tins of Fray Bento's I carried<br/>I chucked in the trench then &amp; there.<br/>as I heard the poor beggars pounce on it<br/>I knew they were caught in the snare.<br/>Next morning broke calm &amp; peaceful<br/>What a shame that we soldiers must fight<br/>Twas a pitious scene met my vision<br/>with the first rosy quivers of light<br/>When I peeped in the trench not a turk sir<br/>was left of that legion accurst<br/>For they'd whacked the Fray Bento's between them</p>
<p>&amp; each man had perished from thirst.</p>
<p>Thats my tale &amp; if you know our mob sir<br/>You'll know how our Colonel can smile<br/>He said to me Pte Juggin's<br/>You've dished up the beggars in style<br/>Promotion! some say I deserve it.<br/>But thats really nothing to me.<br/>I don't want honour or glory<br/>but thats how I win the V.C.</p>
