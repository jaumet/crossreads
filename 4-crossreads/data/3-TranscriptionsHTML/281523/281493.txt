<p>19/9/17 Ypres<br/>and Miles and a motor lorry.  All the men had gone on ahead so we soon reached camp and slept until 3 00 in the afternoon &ndash; done.  Foyles had bad luck coming out &ndash; 9 killed by a big shell.  Our total casualties for this little trip just about 100.  At 5 left camp again and marched down past Chateau Belge to Canal area and bivouacked among trees.  The 18th Battn was just marching out to the attack loaded up jesting but everyone had a tense haggard look that is customary before a charge takes place.  Our aircraft is wonderfully busy until dark planes of all descriptions flying overhead.</p>
