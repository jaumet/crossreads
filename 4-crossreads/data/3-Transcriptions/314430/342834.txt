<p>one mortally wounded, and seventeen wounded. Two hours later, I was seized with a numbness down the left side, lost the use of my arm, and almost the use of the left leg. Altogether 50 men were evacuated. The medical officer said I had been "shaken up", and sent me out for a week's rest at the Transport lines. I was carried out on an ammunition limber, which rumbled slowly through a <strike>dark</strike> field en route to <strike>La Heussoye</strike> Lahoussoye. On the way up I saw &amp; heard evidences of Hun 'plane busy bombing <strike>our</strike> battery positions. The Hun used to drop <strike>a</strike>brilliant flares from his machine; these would fall half way to earth, and then became as fixed balls of light, and <strike>burned on</strike> hung in the air for a quarter of an hour, thus illuminating a large area of the country beneath. I was jolted severely in the limber, which approached the outskirts of <strike>La H</strike> Lahoussoye about 10. PM, and the first thing I saw, on entering the village, was a huge iron crucifix that loomed up strangely in the darkness. On arrival I was put into a barn and fell asleep on the straw <strike>where</strike> until <strike>I was</strike> disturbed by a Hun plane dropping bombs on the village. The explosions made the night hideous, &amp; <strike>kept</strike> frequently cast lumps of dirt and debris upon the roof of <strike>the barn</strike> my shelter. On the 16th inst I was sent on to <strike>the</strike> hospital where I <strike>made</strike> am at this date.</p>
