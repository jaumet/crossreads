July 4th (Sunday)  Arrived & anchored at Greenhythe in the Thames at 7 a.m.  Went ashore 11 a.m. & got a train to Cannon St Station, London, 16 miles further up the Thames.  Beautiful green fields & hedges all the way along & they looked magnificent it being a nice spring day.  Had lunch in the city & got in the Tube Railway & shifted to somewhere or other, then got on top of several buses & had a look about.  Saw Bow Bells Church, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Commons & Lords & St Paul's Cathedral where the pigeons feed out of your hand.  Also saw the City of Londons only tree, Nelsons Monument in Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace & Cleopatras Needle all the way from Egypt.  Of course also had to go & see Piccadilly & Leicester Square & the Tipperary bar.
July 5th  Today being my birthday anniversary (I suppose it was on that account) I spent it busy with customs people.  A man is very near pested to death with them in this Country.  However I got ashore late in the afternoon & spent it there till midnight
Seem to be able to find my way abut easily & I certainly enjoy getting in amongst the busy traffic, - which those who have been to London before say is impossible almost to navigate yourself through - suppose it is human nature however.  I think that a man would need to become suddenly paralysed to get run over here.
July 6th  Went ashore 2 p.m. with the Captain.  We got a Taxi & drove around the City, through Hyde park & Rotten Row & also saw the smallest house in London, and
