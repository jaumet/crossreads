<p>All hands working laying troughing, putting down horse lines (difficult in the sand) &amp; trying to find Regimental baggage sent by rail.  This is a Godforsaken sandy place, but better than the Peninsular &amp; Soldiers would not be happy if they did not growl<br/>We evidently will have our Base here for some time with trips into the Desert with Camels.<br/>Hardly any trace of yesterdays rain, Sand blowing in Clouds again.<br/>Good for sore eyes, all the Arabs are afflicted with a sort of blight, &amp; the Flies made them look pleasant.</p>
