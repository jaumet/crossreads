<p>Two million Beer Wasps die;<br/>Shackleton has met his fate;<br/>The Bulgars fly on Bikes;<br/>The Kaiser runs a "two-up" school<br/>Dutchmen flood their dykes</p>
<p>The King is now in New South Wales<br/>And says he's gong to stay;<br/>Zeppelins bomb a few more babes;<br/>Yanks are making hay.<br/>And this goes on for ever,<br/>And seldom is it true,<br/>But I know for a blankey cert<br/>That Tomorrow we'll have stew</p>
<p>Many a ship's been lost at sea<br/>For want of a skilfull Master.<br/>Many a Tommy has lost his tart<br/>Cause Anzac's Proved the faster.</p>
