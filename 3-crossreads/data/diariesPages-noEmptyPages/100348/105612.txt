Have an enormous amount of work to do here. They have promised us that this will be our winter quarters; and as the trenches are in a disgusting state we will have to fix them up, in the way we know how. Fritz "strafes" us a good deal with "minnewerfers"; as he calls his large trench mortars. These bombs make a terrific explosion; for they weigh about 100 pounds; I can see them coming too and that makes them hard to get used to.

Went up to the front line trenches this morning and took over. The lines are close here between 30 and 40 yards apart. We are on "Hill 60" there has been terrific fighting here at times. It is very quiet now however.
