  
 and intention in the world, I cannot think it is possible for any man, who is much over fifty, to command a battalion successfully in the warfare we are now having.  I feel sure you will yourself understand this, and will realise that it must be in the general interests of the Service to make way for a younger man, and I only want to let you know how much I sympathise with you in going. 
 Yours very sincerely, 
 W.R. Birdwood
