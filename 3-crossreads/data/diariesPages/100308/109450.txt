the Battalion and gear is expected to come in about noon. The other Battns. parading as usual ? bands playing. Arranged for baths this afternoon 50 men half hourly. In the morning we leave early clearing Pozieres at 9 a.m. marched in about noon and settled everyone down in the huts which had not been properly cleaned by the outgoers. Had a long cold wait before anything eatable appeared and lost touch with O.P. my batman. When he appeared he said he had been having his lunch. Rather amusing! Later he went into Bapaume and did not return until late and then odorous of drink. A dag! Several officers much off color owing to thyphoid inoculation. Heavy snow fell in late afternoon and drifted into a thick carpet covering everything. In the evening C.O. assembled O.Q. Corp for a few remarks on march discipline
Transport. Ours is becoming too slack Evans being fat easygoing. A change there would be good
