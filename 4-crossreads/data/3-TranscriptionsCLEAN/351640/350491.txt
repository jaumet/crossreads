The last ocean liner reaching such climax in her history was the P. & O. mail boat China, Sydney to London, which midst the joyment of a dining crowd raced high on to the land called Perim Island, standing sentinel for the Red Sea at the straits narrow mouth.  Let us pray that no disaster awaits our ship Kyarra, were it otherwise you would be amongst those who shed tears over the this well known waterway. 
 In religions Ceylon is well catered for.  All sections of Christians are represented in Colombo, their God with Christ as his prophet and the Bible as His book is spoken of and disseminated by Catholics to Salvation Army.  The Buddhists spread knowledge of One God, Buddha or Gotamma [Gautama] as his prophet and the books of the Veda as his teaching, originally twelve, six or seven are still extant.  The Mahomedans with One God, Mohammed his prophet, and the Khoran as the holy book wherein is stored up the wisdom upon which has been constructed the preachings of the teachers.  There are many sections of the two latter as of the first named.  When one asks in rambling round - What  are  mean the markings on that man's forehead, or that ones? - reply is made - They serve to show his religions sect.
