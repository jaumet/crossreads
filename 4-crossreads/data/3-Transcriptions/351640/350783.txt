<p>heaps of sunshine into my life, and at many a moment when you little thought.</p>
<p>I wrote that a letter went from me to Mr Franki congratulating the family upon Noel being an M.B. of Sydney University.  Shows what perseverance and a little ability may accomplish.  A good and gentle Mother is always overjoyed at progress by her sons or daughters.</p>
<p>New South Wales is as big as Egypt, and Tamworth is a fair distance from Sydney.  During March there may be high temperatures even in Sydney.</p>
<p>The St Mary's Cathedral wrangle will work out all right.  In the scheme of City improvements the ground near College Street must play an important part.  Before you are very much older Queen's square &amp; its neighbourhood will be greatly altered, &amp; for the better.  The spot deserves proper treatment.  There is always a heap of silly nonsense written and spoken when religious people take the floor.  It is sad to listen to them, but it has been ever thus.  Thank you for sending me the printed letters.</p>
<p>The Moxham baby is of course of the best.  My love to it.  No one here knows that the Dudley hospital has been disbanded, the information to hand is that it is still in existance near Boulogne.  Tabby wrote not a word about Gladys Marks &amp; her Belgian experiences.  Kitty inserted a little in her letter about the lady &amp; her doings.</p>
<p>You for the winter we for the Summer preparing.  Yes the dresses that have come under my notice as pictures look hideous.  Do not adopt them.  Stick to some simple style, even though it be of other days than those coming.  Modesty &amp; neatness in dress become a lady at any age, &amp; bespeak her mental qualifications.<br/>It must be an agreeable change for Doris to come to Sydney from Blackheath.  With the visitors away Cramond must be somewhat lonely for anyone.</p>
