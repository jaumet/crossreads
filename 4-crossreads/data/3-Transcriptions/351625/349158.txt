<p>but I am afraid we will be in France by then.  N.C.O's schools seem to be off for anyone that hasent already been to France.  I have just sent away a whole heap of Christmas cards to all our friends &amp; relations which will do instead of letters which would take such a long time to write &amp; we find it hard to write regularly to everyone.  The strikes seems to be a pretty rotten affair the way they are going in Australia.  I would not be surprised to get back from this war in time to see civil war and I would just like to see half those striking laborites shot down.  It is getting on to bed time now so will close this letter, best love &amp; kisses to all, hoping you all have a Merry Christmas &amp; a Happy New Year.  I remain,</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Douglas</p>
