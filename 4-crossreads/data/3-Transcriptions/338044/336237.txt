<p>10th August:- Thursday<br/>Awoke late (8 am) and after a hurried toilette &amp; breakfast reached Hdqus at 9-10 am. It was rather cold &amp; raining (the first rain I have seen since last Christmas in Egypt). Cleared up later on to a nice day. Lunch at Salvation Army as usual which cost 1fr 25c &amp; a good lunch too. Am feeling very unwell &amp; done up &amp; even worse today. Determine to see the doctor &amp; get a few days off duty. This cold &amp; the continued rough living has pulled me down thoroughly. After tea take a long walk with Sgt Lake around the hill overlooking Rouen commanding a fine view of the town. Some very nice residences &amp; clean streets &amp; the air is beautifully clear. A cup of coffee awaits me at home, &amp; after a chat (in French) to Madame    &amp; Madamoiselle, go to bed rather late</p>
