<p>Harefield Park Hospital<br/>Dec 10th 1916<br/>My Darling Mother</p>
<p>I have been transferred to the above named hosp. a couple of weeks ago and a few days after arrival was boarded for Australia which means that I will be coming home on one of the first hospital ships leaving for down under.   Am feeling pretty good now altho. my shoulder wound is not yet healed the piece of shrapnel went in under the collar bone and came out thro the shoulder blade, fracturing a couple of bones on its way thro.   Until the shoulder heals my right arm from the shoulder to elbow is practically useless.    The wound in my leg was caused by a piece of shell casing, hit me on the back of thigh just above knee &amp; took out a small lump of flesh and injured some of the muscles so that I wont be able to walk for a month or two yet &amp; owing to the wound in my shoulder am unable to use crutches, so I just lay in bed and poke fun at those fellows that have to get about on crutches &amp; they sling off at me for not getting up.</p>
