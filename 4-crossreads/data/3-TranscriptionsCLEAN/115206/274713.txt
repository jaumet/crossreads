 Battery W.L. Weather dull and windy. Wind from N .W. with plenty of bite in it. Fritz put a few into Querrie, Received a letter from Aunt Ellie, an Aunt I did not know I possessed. Gunn down for a run. Knipe still indisposed think he's swinging the lad. Had a run across to Bussy, and interviewed Simonde and Solange. More bombs tonight.
