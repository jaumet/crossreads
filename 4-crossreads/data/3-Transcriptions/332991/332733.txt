<p>Thursday February 22. 1917.<br/>A very dull cloudy day with a light misty rain.  There has been very little bombardment during the past few nights.  The front in this sector is very quiet at present.  With J. H. Mathews and A. Ashley I was putting down duck boards for a path near the stables this morning.  W. H. Handcock is still working in the stables putting in new feed boxes, and general repairs.<br/>About 4 o'clock this evening I with others went with 2 limber wagons for straw to a French farm.  It was in sheaves.  We got 500 kilogs (1/2 a ton) and delivered it in Armentieres at the Head Quarters of the 38. Batt.  It was a cold drive on top of the load. we got back about 8.p.m. and had our tea.  Most of the work was in the dark.</p>
