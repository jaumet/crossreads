  
 Ypres& Ottawa Camp 19/10/16 was an elderly Major accompanied by his H.Q. officers - a decent crowd.  Their M.O. was a Melbourne man Haines by name.  They had an easy time on the Somme this time and we spent a couple of hours exchanging reminiscences of different portions of  the line.  They also know Madame Chavasse of the shop  of Burberry in Armentieres "the Boeuf" and the lady of the John Bull shop.  Some of  these estaminet, girls are known right through the British Army from Ypres to La Basse.  Rain set in and troops continued arriving in the building until in its confines we had about 1600 men.  At 9.45 pm our unit started to move in parties of 50 at 2 minutes intervals -full packs up and all gear.  The square was busy with transport and troops.  Our chaps splashed on through the mud to the rear of the Asylum where all halted.  Mc Lennan had been detailed as entraining officer and had all of our arrangements made.  Presently a dark armoured train glided up and the men made an excellent entrainment.  We set off at a steady pace and the driver pulled up at Vlamertine and we disentrained.  I had a guide waiting here and he guided us to our camp along dark muddy roads.  Coming in we passed some English  Fusiliers and a horse in the [indecipherable].  I had sent Miles on ahead to alert the hosts and we marched straight into allotted billets.  The cookers served up hot tea to every man before turning in.  An excellent night's work and all arrangements worked very smoothly.  Plenty of accommodation and a large mess room. We had supper of cheese and onions.  A great relief to get back to a place where we are out of shell range and can expose lights.  The grass [indecipherable] in the huts is very boggy and [indecipherable].  The men were very funny mimicking the [indecipherable] they have been with today.
