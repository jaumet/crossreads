  
 Signals - Gilbert Frankau 
 The hot wax drips from the flares On the scrawled pink forms that litter The bench where he sits:  the glitter Of stars is framed by the sandbags atop of the dugout stairs And the lagging watch hands creep And his cloaked mates murmur in sleep - Forms he can wake with a dick - And he hears as he plays with the pressel switch, the strapped receiver click, On his ear that listens, listens, And the candle-flicker glistens On the rounded brass of the switchboard, where the red wires cluster thick. 
 Wires from the earth, from the air; Wires that whisper and chatter At night when the trench-rats patter And nibble among the rations, and scatter back to their lair; Wires that are never at rest, For the linesmen tap them and test, And ever they tremble with tone.
