<p>Thursday 30-11-16<br/>Fritz sent a shell over yesterday &amp; killed an unfortunate German prisoner,  Bad luck.<br/>Our Reos [reinforcements] are rather amusing they start chatting [searching for lice] directly they arrive &amp; when they catch one or two, exult considering they are already old Soldiers.  We had a Bath today.  Nos. 1 &amp; 2 Platoons went out to Flers working on dug outs.</p>
<p>Monday 4-12-16<br/>Fritz caught an Engineers dug out a couple of days ago &amp; Killed 9 out of 11.  A fine day to day</p>
<p>Wednesday  6-12-16<br/>He Blew 4 Tommies to pieces &amp; wounded 7 others in one dug out yesterday.  I won't chronicle any more of these items.  We only get about 9 Hrs day light now.  The Gaurds Brigade only stayed here 4 or 5 days when they came in.  Done one Stunt &amp; Hopped out again.  Lucky Beggars.</p>
