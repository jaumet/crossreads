  
 The same day as I was relieved from the Line a Military Funeral was held for Jim Powel.  As I was down with Influenza I could not attend, & I was rather glad that this was so as I did not with to be at the sad ceremony. 
 16th May - 28th May 1918. During the next ten days I had rather a good time at Hd Qrtrs, not much work to do, & plenty of time to do it in. The weather lately has been improving, & the days are getting hot. Plenty of swimming has been indulged in, which was most enjoyable. To be relieved from the Line during this hot weather & being able to have plenty of bathing is very refreshing. A couple of good concerts were held during the week & the Stadium was well patronised. The country surrounding the Factory is now beginning to look very fine, fields are in good condition.  It seems a pity that amid such beautiful surroundings & seeing nature in all its beauty that not very far away a terrible struggle is proceeding & the country is being destroyed in a barbarians manner. On the 23rd inst., it was twelve months since the Ambulance was relieved at Bullecourt, & were billetted at Bapaume. Fritz by the way is now in these places. 
 On the 26th inst. my pal Eric Herford left the Unit, he obtained a job at the A.D.M.S.' Office, Divisional Hd. Qrtrs. Gradually the old hands are disappearing from the Unit & I do not like to see it I can assure you. 
 27th May 1918. Another one of my pals sent away to hospital to-day.   Will Macdonald, was badly burnt with gas & was evacuated immediately. I went out to take his place, this time on the C Section sector.
