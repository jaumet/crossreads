Married in Garrison Church at No. 14 A.G.H.  Her letter to us was fine.  My dear "Children" & signed Mollie Germain, her last signature on our noticeboard under that name. Went No. 14 5.30 p.m. all friends out.  Now this place is my home as it were & I feel it so and have settled down into it all.  The bugle calls, weird voices of the natives, long lines of tents & everywhere men, men are becoming part of my daily life & it is hard to imagine myself back at "Wilga".  Such lovely nights if only one had someone to go out with.
