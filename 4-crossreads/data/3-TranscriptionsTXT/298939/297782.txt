 Monday 4th May 1917 Commenced duty week yesterday, &amp; I, being in the tent division, am on the observation Hosp. It is a good job There are three of us with a Lance Corp who is an oldish steady old chap, who knows his work fairly well, but is not very quick.  He is a nice chap. The other two are young &amp; very straight kind of chaps &amp; full of life. Went to Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon &amp; saw aunts &amp; uncles.
