<p>At Sea<br/>Today</p>
<p>My dear mother,</p>
<p>Letter writing was never my strong point, but when there is nothing to say &amp; when even if there was something to sat, a rigid censorship would prevent me from saying it, the task becomes impossible.</p>
<p>We are all well except Jack Mant who has a touch of some sort of fever &amp; is just recovering from the effects of it. Judging by the amount of food &amp; chocolates he puts away I should say that he has quite recovered, but he has been in bed for some days &amp; is still a bit weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was captain of the day, &amp; had to accompany the ship's captain &amp; O.C. Troops on their inspection of the troop-decks, &amp; quarters. Everything is clean as a new pin for this inspection, &amp; the tin plates knives &amp; forks are polished up till you can see your face in them. The cyclists were complimented on always</p>
