<p>10th July<br/>was surprised to hear that H was going into camp let me know if possible what Batt. he goes into.   I think all letters have reached me now coming to hand fairly regularly now.   Chas G</p>
<p>I have received your letter with extracts from Alans diary Mother, Dear also the parcel, it arrived a few days ago.   The Chocolate are appreciated,although we can get lots of it here, we have a job to get the plain Choc. other sweets I seldom worry about.   there are a few delicacies that we go in for when we get a chance, preserved fruit is our favourite, but it is fairly dear 21d per tin Cocoa, etc. now the cherries are ripe and allthough they are dear, we buy whenever we get a chance,   A hat full costs 10d, one Franc this is not very much when we have plenty to spend.   some of the boys waste their money gambling for pennies and drinking French beer Vin etc. most of the drinks manufactured over here are, worse than our worst.   the french beer sold in some places is more like sour tea favoured with vinegar than anything else, "I have seen a good beer drinker taste it then set his glass down and walk away disgusted, he could not swallow the stuff   Their wines are not much better, no doubt better quality would be obtainable in Gay Paree or any of the larger cities but in those places we will never be.   There are few things to buy in most of the villages.  I got some good Cigars in one place, they were a welcome change after smoking light tobacco's of different brands and quality for some time, I dont care much for the english brands of Tobacco that we get but I am getting used to it.   I have some good old Australian Plug that I keep and use some now and again to mix with the lighter brands &ndash;</p>
