<p>26/12/17 Ploegsteert &amp; Kortepyp<br/>Took a C.T. at Mud Corner and went up to St. Yves. The trench here runs round what was the post office of the place and some people live under it! Watched the scene from here and then returned to Hyde Park Corner. From here we caught a motor lorry back as far as the old windmill. Spent the rest of the afternoon &amp; drafted the operation order. After mess sent for all the officers and gave them some rules about how to do fatigue &ndash; check tools &amp;c. Cawthorne received word he is for the Indian Army &ndash; a serious loss to me. This now makes three &ndash; Bunning, Cawthorne and Alderson. Little Sutherland will make an Adjutant some day but there is a good deal of weakness among the other material. A bright cold night with the moonlight glinting on the snow and the stars just like silver winking out of the blue. Cannonade on the front.</p>
