<p>9th April 1915. [I think this date should be May 1915 &ndash; see the previous date on page 148, and refers to events a year earlier when embarking for Gallipoli]</p>
<p>Came down from Cairo this morning. we entrained at Pont de Khouhba Railway Station some distance out from Cairo. Travelling in the train was a squeeze I well remember. I took off my heavy pack and accoutrements and got down under the seats how I got in I cant now imagine but I squeezed in there somehow and had a fairly good sleep. Arrived at Alexandria at about 7. A.M. got out of the train and had a long wait during which time I went in search of something to eat. which I found at a coffee stall along the dock it was managed by some English ladies belonging to the Y.W.C.A. They did us very well everything good and cheap. About 9.30 AM. stacked our leggings in a heap on the wharf and got issued with a pair of Infantry pants and putties. I had just got my gold wrist watch repaired a day or so before leaving Cairo. I went in swimming in the sea had a good time, came out and stood on my clothes to keep my feet out of the sand and naturally stood, full weight  on my precious watch with the result that I smashed the glass and hey presto finish watch! I brought back that watch to Cairo</p>
