The Temple of the Sphinx.
I went to the temple of the Sphinx: it was with emotion that I surveyed the marvellous collonade of granite pillars, the alabaster pavement, with its niches where once the statues of the great ones stood ? and around me walked and chattered the khaki-clad Australians accepting with characteristic flippancy the whole scene. What a strange contrast in peoples! Could Pharoah walk in this land today, what would he think of us. The men that reared these temples and pyramids were not a flippant race ? they were a race of giants, and their monuments will endure when our race is as the dust of their mouldering temples: The Sphinx will smile inscrutably over Egypt as ever when we are forgotten. The Sphinx is wonderful. Its body and limbs crumbling into dust. Its face with its queer half smile and wide open eyes stares over the lovely land of fertile Egypt to where gold in the setting sun set like a jewel in the green the minaretted town of Cairo drowses in the haze. The great Kaliphs are long dead and dust in their stately tombs ? but the glamour of Egypt is the same to-day as when Cleopatra's barges swept with silken sails over the bluegreen waters of the Nile. Below on the shady roads roves the endless khaki procession of the sons of a new and older world. (Jack Sommers.)
