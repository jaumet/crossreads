<p>9.15 a.m.  We are now sailing along the Solent opposite the Isle of Wight which we can see faintly through the fog.</p>

<p>2.15 p.m.  We are now anchored at the docks Southampton and large numbers of troops are marching on to the wharf.  The Railway S. Western runs right on to the wharf.  I have never seen such beautifully tinted leaves on trees such as you will see on the way up the Solent</p>
