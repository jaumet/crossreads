 Sunday 27 August 1916 A beautiful morning &amp; day with one or two light but sudden showers. This weather is said to be quite typical of this part at this season of the year. Church parade was held at the 4th Bn. but being slightly upset I stayed at home &amp; during the day got some letters written.
