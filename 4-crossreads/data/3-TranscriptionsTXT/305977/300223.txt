June 1915& for hours there was a continuous rumble of heavy guns firing.  It was said to be the big hill stronghold of the Turks the ships were bombarding.  At night about 11pm the Turks on our left fired very heavily.  Our artillery & bomb-guns opened up & there was a terrible roar & rattle for over an hour during which time we stood to arms, but I don't think the Turks made any attacks.
Saturday 5thPut in an easy morning.  It is alright doing your own cooking for a few days.  You can get so much more tea & your bacon & meat hot, whereas in the trenches it is generally pretty cold before it reaches you.  The Turks gave our position a lot of shrapnel all day, but didn't do much damage.  Segt Tresilian got hit, but not badly.  We went into the supports at 6pm, but had a quiet night & a good sleep.
