Saturday : Jan 29th
a fine clear day : cold morning night : revellie 6 am. physical before breakfast : while out on physical drill we doubled over to a camel corps that was passing and it was very interesting thousands of them the natives have complete control over them : they get down up again at a word from the rider : the tin affair on their jaws seemed to me to be a bit on the cruel side ; altogether it was a weird looking mob : done nothing after brekfast ; went to zoo in afternoon had a good trip. It is very big there is a splendid collection of birds animals. There are two pontoons there where the turks attempted to cross the canal last year : they are bullet shot ridden : the kangaroos have all been presented by the Australian "boys". The "Hippo" was a beauty came out of the water at the keeper's bidding also went back again when told. The crocodiles were nasty looking : the giraffes splendid while the monkeys pelicans ran a dead heat for first prize on the humorous side : taken all round it was a good interesting outing : came home finished the evening writing : the tram journey was also interesting : we crossed the nile the bridges were fine of the "swing open" type. In the zoo there is a splendid suspension bridge over the water about fifty yards long it is very pretty : bought some P. Cards at the Zoo
