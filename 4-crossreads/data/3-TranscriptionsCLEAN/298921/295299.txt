The Ghoorkas suffered thro the frost, half the Battalion was frost bitten - The Ghoorkas get on well with our men who try to teach them our ways - Watched them playing CARDS, to shuffle the Pack then throw them into the air & then collect. More letters & Papers today & good news re Russians coming to our help through Roumania. Will post this as one never knows when a boat will be sunk & better chance a little than the lot.
