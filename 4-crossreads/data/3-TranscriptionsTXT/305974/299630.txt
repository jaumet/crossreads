17 MondayWriting for the last couple of day will have to be excused as I had a mishap & cut my 1st finger on my right hand, which causes much inconvenienceThe weather of late has been very cloudy, but today wasn't too bad.  Took some washing to be done, down to the village this afternoon.  Still cleaning up the in the QMS.
18 TuesdayFinished cleaning up at Q.M.Store & my word we were not sorry either, as we tackled a very large job.  Done some printing & fixing during the evening, & developing in the afternoon, received a letter from George Handley making an appointment, but sorry answered it saying I am sorry I couldn't keep it on Wednesday.
19 WednesdayA most beautiful day, it was absolutely the best since I have been in England.  Done some photography during the evening (We had no parade in the afternoon) detailed for duty cleaning up the Y.M.C.A. Hut, which is a very light job & profitable regarding getting considering we were treated to tea & cakes.  The camp seems lonely since the mob went on leave, there being only about 40 men left.
