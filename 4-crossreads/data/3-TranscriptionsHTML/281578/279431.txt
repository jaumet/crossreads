<p>that far with this load up. I&#39;m afraid a few will drop out. Drew some more bully beef &amp; biscuits this morning. At 10 o&#39;clock we fell in with our big load on in the slushy street, &amp; of course stood there for half an hour, that is the killer in the army, the way they mess you about. I took mine off &amp; put it in the footpath. Finally we set off through the slushy streets, lor&#39; talk about an awful load, it nearly cut one&#39;s shoulders in two where the braces are. We went about 3 miles, the last stretch up a hill &amp; many of the boys dropped out by the wayside, but I stuck it. Then we entered a village called Bonne Ville, &amp; we were allotted to different billets in the village. I struck a very decent spot, an old hay shed with straw on the floor, that about 12 of us were put in. The roof has some holes in, but I don&#39;t think it will rain tonight. We dropped our beloved packs on the floor, &amp; walked &quot;up town&quot;, had 2 glasses of vin rouge at a cafe, every place seems to be either a cafe or an estaminet. Came back to our &quot;billet&quot;, &amp;</p>
