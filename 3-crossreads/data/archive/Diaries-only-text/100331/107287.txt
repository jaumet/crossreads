Thursday 15th
Since Monday things on this front were very quiet, the Weather being very bad, Raining it being very misty which prevented Fritz from coming over for Observations, This Morning the Weather cleared it was fine all day hardly a cloud could be seen Fritz was over Observing very early after Dinner Fritz's big Guns started he was sending high Explosives over all the Afternoon first one side of St Jean station Yard then the other, hitting several old deserted Dug Outs, one shell landed amongst a lot of Teuts sending them kits up in the Air, the Men were all away on duty nobody was hurt, one of his shells landed just in front of 4 9 Point 2. Guns close to Admiral Road about 200 yds from the Yard, the Guns had been fireing for a while the shell soon stopped them, at 4 Pm. I was attatched to a Train containing a Working party, waiting for line clear when a Dud landed a few yards away, much to our relief also two Officers on board my Engine, the line was soon clear off we went to Reigersberg
