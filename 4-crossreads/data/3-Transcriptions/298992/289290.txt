<p>I went up and saw Mr Greenwood, and he had about 5 Tons of Copra which I bought at the price telegraphed to me. I also saw Whitten Bros. but they had none on hand at all, either to sell or to ship. Messrs C.R. Baldwin had a small lot of 5 tons which they have shipped to Sydney, and this and B.P's Copra was not taken on board till our return from Yule Island.</p>
<p>We left Moresby at midnight on the 27th Oct, arriving at Yule Island at 7 a.m. next day. A. Gabriel came on board, and I bought 3 Bags Copra from him. The tally of cargo here turned out 2 Cases Kerosene short.</p>
<p>Sister Patricius was a passenger from Yule Island. I was informed that the usual proceeding there<strike>v</strike>was to issue a ticket for people of the Mission who travelled by our steamers, and the Mission would be debited by Head Office for the amount of the passage. Acting on this, I issued a ticket to Sister Patricius, stating on it that the cost would be debited to the Catholic Mission.</p>
