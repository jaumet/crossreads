  
 that night in their ward. I began stammering an apology for not being able to stay but quickly and meekly changed my tune.  31st  I went to  the  see one of the best Musical Comedies in London entitled Yes Uncle  1st  I met Lt Eric Asbridge today at the Club. He is in the Aust. Flying Corps but was formerly in the old 54th Battalion. We went to see Nothing but the Truth at Her Majestys I think it was.  2nd  Being a beautiful morning I went for a bus ride along High Street Kensington. Did a little shopping and went into town again.
