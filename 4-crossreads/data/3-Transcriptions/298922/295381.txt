<p>Saturday 24 February 1917</p>
<p>KANTARA</p>
<p>Left at 5 a.m. BIR EL ABD for ZEITOUN, will be glad for the change after 3 months of Desert. I get 3 weeks then back to the CRUSADE again.</p>
<p>On arrival KANTARA, [the following crossed through] no arrangements had been made for 109 of us, no Transport or Trucks!</p>
<p>Fortunately a REST CAMP run by Mrs. W. CHISHOLM fed all ranks at a nominal cost &ndash; MISS McPHILLAM helps &amp; Australians &amp; N.Z.s all very thankful for the work these Ladies do, for the SOLDIERS &amp; officers. It is indeed practical WAR work of the best kind. STONE Railway Stations are now being built &amp; the old places we knew in their early desert life have much changed.</p>
