<p>Still on outpost. Small scraps occur every day t'wixt Turks&amp; our PATROL &amp; the railway crawls along towards us. I enclose cutting from bulletin. Trooper K is our cook Old Keppie, a splendid chap &amp; a Bushie. I did not know he had literary talent. I don't know what the C.O. thinks about his last statement.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  If old Sam comes thro' D'quin he might be able to get me leave to come home but I'm doubtful. I see the old man went to America.</p>
<p>Jim Ayre has collected a lot of seeds &amp; I'm enclosing some &ndash; hope no noxious weeds among 'em. Just wild flowers from the Holy Land.</p>
