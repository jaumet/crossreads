<p>24/10/15<br/>Up and out in the dark and during stand to worked off a few odd Alexandria jobs for [indecipherable] 3rd Eshelon.  mornings very dark and stood outside Reg. office waiting for it to get light enough to give the carry on.  An impressive sight in trenches to see all the troops lined up to their posts every man standing like a statue armed to the teeth, their bayonets held close in to the side, and absolute silence being insisted on.  A grim sight.  The command "carry on" (given when dawn has brought enough light for us to watch enemy movement) is the signal for the strain to relax &amp; those off duty dismiss &amp; turn in.  A very trying hour standing there these cold mornings.</p>
<p>The light was slow in growing today and I had to wait a long time standing on the pathway before the signallers could forward the order.  In the distance two hospital ships gay with lights &amp; the Red Cross plainly marked in coloured lights.  Dim outlines of other craft just visible.  Some getting away before daylight to avoid being seen.  Anzac might be full of transports during night but before daylight comes they stand out miles to sea  In the foreground and seemingly just beneath feet, deep dark depths in which perhaps an eye of fire or light denotes a dugout  Pluggers Plateau looming up against the skyline &ndash; a rugged silhouette.  Cold wind off the sea</p>
