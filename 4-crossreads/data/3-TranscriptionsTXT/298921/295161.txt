 July, 1915 Friday 9 We are now very short handed 1800 Horses stabled to exercise feed water &amp; groom. Carry on Instruction &amp; find men for Guards etc:- All hands were jubilant at going to be killed &amp; the remainder very full up of the Desert &amp; the Stables. I have a dozen snapshots to send you of Typical scenes &amp; some of Himself. I now have 725 Seyces to help groom &amp; feed &ndash; not knowing much about Horses they get kicked all over the place, they learn quickly. I cannot speak anything but Koppi &amp; Collarendabir, they speak Arabic.
