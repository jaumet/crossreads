<p>The march gave us a splendid opportunity of seeing London when the people are out.</p>
<p>Thousands and thousands were out taking as much interest in the March as well as the Sun.</p>
<p>It was the most interesting and exciting day I have had for some time</p>
<p>The Aussie it is said can, but does not march like barrack-room soldiers, in fact he was never born to be one, but he is always at the right place when wanted and this fact the English people</p>
