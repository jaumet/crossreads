<p>Tuesday 12 August 1919<br/>Very windy all day.  A little rain. Not much tho. Got an officers team of 8 for a tug of war &amp; we pulled 9 others. Was good. Had a bonny concert tonight. Was very good indeed. The concert party gave it. Should pass the equator tomorrow sometime.</p>
<p>Wednesday 13 August 1919<br/>Crossed the line this morning. Colonel caught us playing poker &amp; asked us not to play. We then played sevens &amp; he thinking we were still at poker came over &amp; said 'Gentlemen, I asked you not to play. Am I to call the adjutant' When he saw it was sevens he bolted. Bonny day. My arms &amp; face got horribly sunburnt. Was judge today for 4 fights. They were all good &amp; required just a little bit of thinking out. Didn't give a bad decision at all. Am pleased. Saw the Southern Cross for the first time.</p>
