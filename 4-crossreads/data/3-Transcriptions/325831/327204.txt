<p>At the close of his Lecture the Chaplain volunteered to answer questions, dealing with the War or Army. Many were very funny &ndash; One Australian had seen in an English paper &ndash; where a Mrs Brown of Clapham had been fined "Three pounds" or "Two months in the 2nd Division" &amp; he wanted to know if that meant with "the Dinkums" (the nickname of our Division).</p>
<p>I am expecting my Brother who is coming to see me here, his long delayed leave having come at last. We had three days to-gether at Rouen &ndash; which was our first meeting since we left Egypt nine months before.</p>
<p>I was so glad to meet Lieut Ferguson while on Salisbury Palins &amp; knowing how keen he is, was glad to hear of his appointment.</p>
<p>We will be sorry to lose Genl Holmes from the 5th Brigade. I believe the 18th Colonel who is now Brigadier Genl, now has charge of the 5th Brigade.</p>
<p>I must close now</p>
<p>Yours sincerely etc</p>
