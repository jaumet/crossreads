<p>imagine them just as I saw them last, the brats, growing up are they?  I grudge very much the cut this war's taking out of our lives:  however its got to be done, but I'm looking forward to the end of it.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Mrs. Billy Ellis from New Zealand.  She writes regularly to me:  they were all well at the time.</p>
<p>And now I shall stop for today.  I've given you absolutely all the news I've got and there isn't any more to tell about this side of the world:  we shall be busy for the next couple of days getting into action again, our rest is finished.</p>
<p>Give my love to old John &amp; to Graham &amp; to you.</p>
<p>Cheer ho &amp; every good luck go with you all.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Jock C. Ellis</p>
