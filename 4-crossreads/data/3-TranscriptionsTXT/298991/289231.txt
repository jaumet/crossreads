Friday Oct 26thEvery one is very busy preparing to going ashore. Leave is granted from 9 am till 11 pm. We got punctually off the boat at 9 am & walked up to the centre of Capetown, a distance of about 2 miles. Capetown is a very nice City, with a fairly large population chiefly consists of Dutch & half castes, & I can safely say, that every other nationality is represented, of course, bar those of the enemy.
The streets are nice wide & cleanly kept. There are some very fine buildings here especially the G.P.O. etc. The people seem to be on very good terms with the Australians. My pal & I were rather fortunate. A Lady, by name Mrs Morton invited us out to an Hotel she is staying at. She is a Tasmanian Lady & is down from Johannesburg on a holiday. We had a very pleasant time at the Hotel (boarding only), of course we felt out of place sitting down to a six & eigth course meal, everything was made very homely for us.
Went to Camp Bay in the afternoon, it is about an hour & a half in the tram, very picturesque and a most pleasant ride, supposed to be one of the best in the world. After tea we went to the Tivoli Theatre.
