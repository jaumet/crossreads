there to see you.
I hope that no one at home has had the Influenza badly, thousands of people over here have died from it, so it is not nice.
I have a lot more letters to write now, so must make a start on them. No more now, and don't grow too big before I come back.
lots of love & kisses & hugsfromDadOXOXOXOX
