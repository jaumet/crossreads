 3. A.G.H. Cairo 8 May 1916 
 My own beloved Mother &amp; Father I don't feel like writing tonight, so I am afraid it will be a poor letter. It is very hot and close and I feel sleepy. I am still very busy having a full ward of 80 patients. But am very happy in my work and feel glad that I have plenty to do. I have had great pleasure the last week given me by kind Major Man, who was here for a week awaiting a transport to take him to England. I do hope he will arrive safely. He had not been in Cairo before, and wished me to go sight seeing with him, which I did with Patsy Rhindell and he took us in the most luxurious way, in a car every where and showered kindness on us. I have posted you some snapshots. He took us in a launch on the Nile &ndash; and we landed and boiled a billy and he introduced me to some very interesting men &ndash; one a Major Lassure who is Professor of Chemistry and lectures at St Thomas' Hospital &ndash; is out here in the Artillery &amp; a Major Jones in the Ordinance who may be very useful to us
