<p>Many of these last that were forced to land were damaged by machine gun fire that they could not be repaired before our advance, with the result that, ultimately they also fell into our hands.  The remains of a considerable number of machines that had been burnt at enemy aerodromes just prior to our occupation, were also found.</p>
<p>As illustrati[o]n the great part that 1st Squadron played in these operations, it may be noted here that during the two months immediately preceding the opening of our offensive, every enemy machine accounted for on the whole front went to the credit of this unit. In addition this Squadron was responsible for 11 strategical reconnaissance and photography, carried out numerous attacks on ground targets with bomb and machine gun fire, escorted all bomb raids, and carried out hostile aircraft patrols daily. From the commencement of July until the date of the Armistice with Turkey &ndash; October 31st, 1918 &ndash; the flying hours of the Squadron reached the substantial total of 2,862 &ndash; an average of ob[v]er  700 hours a month. 157 strategical reconnaissances and 77 photographic reconnaissances were carried out, 604 Square miles of enemy territory was photographed, 1,903 plates being exposed and 21,581 prints produced. Bomb raids to the number of 150 were carried out, 45,948- lbs. of bombs were dropped while a total of 241,000 machine gun rounds were fired from our machines.  During the same period the members of this Squadron destroyed 17 enemy machines in aerial combats, and drove 33 down.</p>
<p>When this period opened the Squadron was still located at the RAMLEH aerodrome.</p>
<p>JULY:   The month of July was an active time for the Squadron, the flying hours increasing to 727. In all 37 strategical reconnaissances were carried out including 9 special reconnaissances, in the cours[e] of which a good deal of new ground was covered. On the 6th JAUF ED DERWISH, a station on the HEDJAZ  Railway between KUTRANI and MAAN  was reconnoitred by Lieut. E.F. Kenny (pilot) and Lieut, L.W. Sutherland, M.C.  D.C.M. (observer) involving a flight of about 225 miles. Two days later this station was bombed by machines from R.A.F. Squadrons, escorted by Lieuts. H.A. Blake (pilot) and H.A. Letch (Observer). The latter flew South of JAUF ED DERWISH to reconnoitre the railway to MAAN. On both these occasions the old German aerodrome[e] at BEERSHEBA was used as an advanced landing Ground.</p>
<p>SEMAKH, which is situated at the Southern end of the sea of GALLILEE was visited for the first time on the 21st by Lieut. P.J. McGinness, D.C.M. (pilot) and Lieut. H. Fysh (observer)  A considerable concentration of cavalry was found there, also an aerodrome.  These targets were machine gunned from a few hundred feet, 900 rounds being fired apparently with good effect. The country round AMMAN and DAMIE was reconno[i]tred on 13 occasions, the Western area on 10 occasions, AFULE JENIN and BEISAN were also visited several times.</p>
<p>Photographic reconnaissances to the number of 24 were carried out and 156 square miles of country covered chiefly in the TIREH area, and in the vicinity of WADI ISKANDEHUNEH, 524 plates were exposed and 7,028 prints produced. In addition a number o[f]s aspect photographs were taken.</p>
<p>Members of the Squadron were engaged in the 10 aerial combats in the course of which 5 enemy machines were destroyed and 10 were driven down. 31 attacks on enemy troops were made. Escorts to bombing formations from other Squadrons were provided on 31 occasions, and 140 hostile aircraft patrols were carried out.</p>
<p>On the 3rd. Capt. A.R. Brown (pilot) and Lieut. G. Finlay (observer) while on patrol attacked an enemy two-seater machine near HUWARAH. They drove the enemy machine down to 500 feet over the Turkish lines, but after firing a few bursts at close range they were compelled to break off the engagement owing to heavy machine guns fire from the ground. Their machine was hit in several places.</p>
<p>When the reconnaissance and escort machines &ndash; Pilots;- Capt. R.M. Smith, M.C. and Lieut. C.S. Paul, Observers:- Lieut. W.A. Kirk  and W.J.A. Weir &ndash; were over JENIN aerodrome[e] on the 9th., a motor car was seen moving rapidly amongst the hangars.</p>
