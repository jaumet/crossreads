<p>Dear old Mick,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your letter which I duly received but which I had not time to answer before I left [indecipherable].  I must also thank you for the Varsity results and also for the swastika.  I appreciate it all the more, knowing it to be a gift from our dear little Mater.</p>
<p>Remember me to Decent &amp; Miss Cohen &amp; explain to them the impossibility of me writing to them, but give all my friends my best wishes &amp; ask them to write to me.</p>
<p>Have not received a "Torchbearer" as yet.  Will you also try &amp; get me a "Hermes" &amp; send it along.</p>
<p>Best love to the Jenkos, Greigs &amp; Jones, also to Callie &amp; Nan.  Will write to them as soon as I can.</p>
<p>Ever your affectionate brother<br/>Eric</p>
