<p>visit him. Nothing loath I did as requested. He has a very pretty little house near our billet and a most beautiful garden, which is at present resplendent with dahlias.<br/>The owner is more bovine than leonine.<br/>He is an immense man and extremely fat - in fact the image of fatty Arbuckle of Keystone fame only somewhat fatter. I have never seen anyone resemble that famed picture-commedian more closely. His hand and arm were exceedingly swollen and although the bite was only a small one it had not been cleaned properly and had festered. Nevertheless, both he and his wife ignored the bite, saying that it was nothing, and attributed the swelling to rheumatism. It appears that he frequently suffers similarly from this complaint.</p>
