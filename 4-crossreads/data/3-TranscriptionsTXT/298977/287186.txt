 Pts. 1280 R. Richards M.G.S. 19th Batt. 5th Brig. A.I.E.F. Aerodrome Camp, Heliopolis &ndash; Egypt. 12th August 1915. 
 My dear Mother, 
 Just a few more lines to say that I am still very O.K. and getting very fit.  Getting a bit used to the sand and heat now, though it is terribly hot. 
 There is very little further I can tell you about here.  Have not had a chance to get into Cairo and see any sights as leave was stopped.  There is a Ramadan Festival (a religious ceremony) on now, and as they say the natives feelings are very easily aroused at this time, they stopped us from going in, as they did not want any friction caused. 
 We had a night attack and bivouac one night this week, which was pretty strenuous as far as we were concerned.  We left camp at about 7.30 and Marched into the Desert until about 1 a.m.  We then dug ourselves in, we of course having to dig trenches for the guns.  We were supposed to be taking up a defensive position and our guns were on the left flank of the Company's line of trenches.  We then had to do guard in half hour stretches through the night, and during the remainder got what sleep we could.  We got our packs on again at daybreak, and got back to camp at about 8.30 a.m., just about knocked up.  We have also had a long route March . 
 There are rumours that we are leaving here in a few days now, and I am jolly pleased to say that I think it is pretty true.  We of course have not the least idea as to where we are going, but hope it is the real thing, though, it sounds too good to be true, as we have only been over here such a short time, and there are troops over here who have been over 10 months and have not seen action yet.  Anyhow if it is so I feel very confident that I am coming out all right. 
 I mentioned in my previous post cards that I was sending over a few souvenirs.  I bought a couple pieces of silk for you and Ruby, which I think you will like, but I have not yet had a chance to get them away.  If I don't get them away before we leave I will hang on to them and send them first chance I get. 
 Don't think I can scrape up any more news, but will write again first chance I get. 
 Love to all. From your loving Son Pte 1280 Roy Richards.
