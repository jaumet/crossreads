<p>SOMEWHERE IN HELL,<br/>5th August, 1916.<br/>Just a line. In my last-&#151;a letter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained why<br/>you would not receive any letters for a time. In fact I am not sure when you will get this. But as opportunities come will scribble a few lines. I am still paying with a smile, as I know you^are. By the time this reaches you, you will understand the price that some have paid.<br/>2 6/9/16:<br/>And now for the news. Well, I have just had<br/>my name taken-- and rumour has it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well, more that that or<br/>I should not write is, that I may be coming home shortly.<br/>You see they are expecting the war to finish by next Autumn at the latest, and although I will be able to get about easily in a eouple of months' time I would not be fit for r oughing it for a good while after that. Of course I could do lighter work,but their policy is to give that to the Tommies.<br/>When we were out in the Field it seemed as though settling down to civil life would be an easy thing. But I am afraid it's g&#128;%tlSg to be a bit difficult.<br/>We are much more inclined to be irritable and abrupt, t aciturn and a bit moody. Of course it will wear off, but it will take longer than some think.<br/>Womenfolk seem strange to us&#151;fussy and all that kind of thing. It sounds strange doesn't it? but we didn't like them at first. Then we got a little more used to them---</p>
