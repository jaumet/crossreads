Extract from "Morning Post" Aug. 27 1915

But while the new offensive has not achieved the complete success hoped for, the advantage gained by the increased scope for action offered by the extension of the front must not be overlooked. As the Press Bureau statement issued on Wednesday tersely observed, the ground gained and held is of great value. Nor must the warning contained in the succeeding sentence of the statement be disregarded, that further serious and costly efforts will be needed to secure decisive victory. The Turks, with the help of their German organisers, have developed forces greater than appear to have been anticipated. History is repeating itself in the Dardanelles and driving home the lessons of all our former wars. The General in command has done what he could with the forces at his disposal. His troops have acted up to the finest traditions of the Army. It remains for the nation to provide the means needed, here and elsewhere, to achieve success.
