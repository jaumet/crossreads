All the Staff have to learn buzzer work thoroughly now so we are going to do nothing else at present. Went into Ismailia again today on yesterdays pass with Jack Burke. Had tea at Empire Club and wandered round town for a bit. Went to pictures at night. Russ and Edric were round to see me but I missed them. There is also a letter for me at 15th Fld Amb.
