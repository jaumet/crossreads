<p>diarrhoea. That night acute diarrhoea set in and quickly developed into dysentery. So violent did the attack become that eventually kill or cure methods were resorted to. I got through all right and am now convalescent. I am at present eating bread &amp; milk, <strike>(breakf</strike> omelettes, boiled eggs, fish, chicken &amp; vegetables, with cocoa &amp; egg flips for drink. I am putting on weight but am still pretty weak. I am affected with lassitude at present but always leave a clean plate despite this fact. I am to be invalided home shortly on six months furlough. I have no objections whatever. At first when I began to recover I was perpetually hungry. No sooner I had I finished breakfast than I was waiting for 10.30 to come round round &amp; so on from meal to meal.</p>
