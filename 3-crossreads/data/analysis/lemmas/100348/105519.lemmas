 18/1/16 There was no leav today . Becaus some of the fellow were detain by the polic in the citi last night . I reckon that the " John Hop " made a mark of our fellow becaus they were conspicu with N.S.W. pencil on their hat band . The Governor of Victoria , Sir . A. Stanley came onto the ship and deliv an address . The usual rot about , "hero go to fight . " But they stop their leav becaus they get drunk . Holdsworth came down onto the pier and I was allow to get off the ship to speak to him , and tell him good-by . There was quit a crowd on the pier to tell us good ?bye when the ship left the pier at 6 P.M. and anchor in the channel . We are not like to get into mischief here .
