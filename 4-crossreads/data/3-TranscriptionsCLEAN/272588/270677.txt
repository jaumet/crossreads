  
 Tuesday 19 March Raining all day to-day making things muddy & miserable.  We were relieved this morning & are now back at Voormezeele Advanced Dressing Station. Either last night or the (? night) previous night Fritz dropped a shell in the back store at the M.D.S. at Kemmell, eight miles or so behind the line. Johns was in at the time & apart from almost being hurled out the roof he escaped with a gash in the face & a broken nose. 
 20th March I have just seen a remarkable order issued by the O.C., 3rd Field Ambulance to whom we are attached to the effect that in the event of heavy shelling of the A.D.S. all except on special duty are to evacuate the place & retire to Brasserie for instructions. 
 Wednesday 20 March At Vormeezeele I went for a bath.  Though wet this morning it is now beautifully fine & moonlit.  Apparently this much advertised German offensive is not to be delayed too long but I think the main attack will be delivered against the French. However the artillery activity on this front has shown a marked increase during the last week or so.  He is shelling heavily all the back areas here, Kemmel & as far back as Balliel, Meteren, Strazeele, Hazebrouck, etc. On our part our artillery defence is marked & even behind of our 25" & 12" guns are batteries of 18 pdrs.  Such preparations for a German blow I haven't seen before. Rumour has it that notice has been given to inhabitants of villages near the line to evacuate & also that the M.D.S. at Kemmel should be moved.  I can't say what is in the rumours.  Rumour about spies are also rife.
