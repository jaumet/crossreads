Went to Marseilles. Had a look around. Very clean city particularly after Egypt. All streets paved with stones. Tram fares cheap, 8 miles for one penny: A number of wounded French in the city legs off, maimed and blind, Hundreds wearing decorations. The most decorated people I have ever seen, almost every soldier wears a medal of some sort. A sight that make one think, is the milliners shops absolutely all Crepe, particularly the women hats. Hundreds of women in mourning. Dull weather but fine2-4-1916The rations issued here, are very light
