me.  Mr Saxby's two sons, Eric & Keith are also here in the first Ambulance, & I had a yarn to the elder one on Sunday.If this should reach you & my later one shouldn't, I would like to wish you very many Happy Returns of the Day for the 9th March.  It will probably reach you early, but we can't judge the mails to a Day here.  I hope it will be a Happy Birthday Mother Day, & you can be sure I will be thinking of you an extra lot that day if I am alive.Must close now, With best love to yourself & Father dear, & also Anna.Your loving LeoP.S. You must please excuse the scrawl, but I am writing under peculiar position- sitting on a kit bag in the tent with a candle stuck on a lid of a jam tin for a candlestick.  This is suspended with 3 wires to the tent, & to stop it from swaying about in the wind I have my old boot tied to the bottom of it.  Leo.
