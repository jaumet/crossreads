It was most difficult walking along the frozen road, every now &amp; again some one would topple over:  I came a cropper on several occasions. Our first glimpse of our village did not give us a good impression of our home, a hot drink was available on arriving at our destination,  then all turned in, dog tired &amp; cold.</p>
