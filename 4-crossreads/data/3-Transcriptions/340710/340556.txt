<p>England<br/>Aug 1917.</p>
<p>Mein Leibe Frau,<br/>I now a prisoner am and very happy but wishing to the Front again to go-not.  We every day some kind of fun have and food we all day eat but a little sausage I would like as the skin I   <strike>am</strike> very fond of chewing am.  To morrow of some sports we take but I shall an expectorater be as I too full of food am.<br/>Goodbye till the War over is<br/>Your Hun Selfish<br/>Hans</p>
