have each available for trenches just about 70 men ? except D Co whose casualties have reduced theirs to about 50 odd. After lunch the Artillery car called for me and I met Colonel Cohen and went to Pont Noyelles where were the Colonel and officers of the 108 RFN whose evidence we proceeded to take as a Court of Inquiry. Some of these chaps were very old gunners and had had much active service. From here we drove to Dion to get our shorthand evidence typed and I had afternoon tea with General Phillips having some interesting talk. The car then took us back through Querrieu where a big shell today accounted for 50 men of a Labour company killed and wounded. Noticed a very fashionably dressed man with a tall and very chic lady. These must have been Billjims dressed up I think. Home through La Houssaye to Franvillers . Many camouflaged dumps of shells en route here and some big guns emplaced. Had Mess and then did some writing. Went down to the Battalion office and fixed up a number of matters there. It was a quiet evening on the front. 100 of my men were away digging. Word came back of a German wireless intercepted which said our front line would be strafed between 3 and 5 am. Posted extra sentries and put an extra officer on duty.
