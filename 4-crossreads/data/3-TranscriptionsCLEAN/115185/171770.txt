2/ I was on duty - we leave here today. I don't suppose it matters in telling that for when you get this all importance of the news will be over - I don't suppose that letters to England will be censured.I have seen quite a lot of people - they come on board from time to time. I have not seen Julian as he is at Williams Haven. He was at Herbertshoe when I arrived - I sent him his mothers parcel but he was rushed off as soon as he got back here - I think he got the parcel.Captain Jackson who
