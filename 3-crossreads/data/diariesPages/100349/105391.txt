10/1/17.
It has been announced that this is our official Christmas, stretching over three days yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Was handed a box of stuff from the Comforts fund; there was no other Christmas cheer. Scott, and I decided to get some. Captured a rooster at the back of a farm house plucked and dressed him; took him round the front of the house and asked Madame to cook it. She did not recognise him with his head off; and she cooked him nicely with trimmings; so we dined well on this auspicious day. Explained the extraordinary circumstances to madame and she produced some good "Vin Rouge" which she presented to us as "Un Souvenir". A decent old lady, shall pay her for the poultry when I have some money.
