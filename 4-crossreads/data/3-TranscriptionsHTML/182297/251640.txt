<p>COPY OF MARCONIGRAPH MESSAGE RECEIVED BY S.S. &quot;BENALLA&quot; 10/11/14.</p>
<p>&quot;Sydeny&quot; started at 7 a.m..&nbsp; At 9.30 she had sighted the enemy sailing at full speed. She was able to get within her range in 20 minutes. At the time she signaled that the chase was steering north. At 10.40 the &quot;Sydeny&quot; was engaging the enemy briskly and at 11.10 the latter beached herself to avoid sinking. The foremast and three funnels were down but the flag was still flying. &quot;Sydeny&quot; then went after &quot;Emden&quot;&#39;s collier, took crew off, and sunk her. The &quot;Sydney&quot; again returned to &quot;Emden&quot; who surrendered. The extent of German casualties are not yet known but they were bound to be severe. The &quot;Sydney&quot;s own casualties required hospital treatment which was probably found on direction to land. The &quot;Emden&quot; had time to destroy Wireless Telegraph Station and to cut one of the three cables, the second cable is intact and is probably there. All the instruments had been destroyed except one which had been buried. The W.T. and cable operators deserved much praise for sticking to their posts and sending out distress signals and for saving instruments. &quot;Sydney&quot; will sail for Colombo as soon as she has succeeded in getting the German wounded and prisoners on board. The operations may take 24 hours as they present considerable difficulties.&quot;</p>
