2.  Well about this interview I was going to tell you of.  There is a Y.M.C.A. secretary here, a gentleman of about sixty or sixty five, who came over from Melbourne a few months ago to help voluntarily in the Y.M. work- his name is Peacock and Rid knew him slightly.  He is a much travelled man, & though I sit at a little table of my own, I often overhear his conversation and have thought him to have a very broad-minded clear judgment on most matters.  Well after your cable came & I had thought about it a lot & tried to decide what I ought to do & wished a great many times that I had someone with whom I could talk it over I decided to ask Mr Peacock what he thought of it.  Now I had talked of it anxiously to Rid & Wal before they had left but had not arrived at anything very clear.  Rid had said that he would quite understand if I thought it best to go home & be quite satisfied, though he spoke of England in just the same way & I could not find out any preference on his part, it was ghastly uncertain!  Wal seemed to favour my going on to England most decidedly & thought it would be a mistake to return now, though would not venture any definite advice.On Sunday night after dinner I had a chat with this Mr Peacock that I have told you of.  He said that there was the educational point of view to be considered in the proposal of going to England, and the value it might be to me all my life, but apart from that he could see no good reason why I should go to England now.  Now that is just the very thing that matters least of all to me in these times, I don't feel one atom that I care a straw about travel, in peace times I shouldn't be so devoid of ambition but just now what heart has one to go travelling & especially alone!Now I was never any good at reasoning (Father will remember the sorrow I used to be in over my geometrical theorems) and maybe
