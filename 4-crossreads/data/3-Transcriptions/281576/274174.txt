<p>privates are to Lance Jacks from date &amp; my name was among 'em greatly to my surprise.  Mac Dougall is another L. Cpl.  He only returned from Blighty this morning.  Brought a Parcel back with him &amp; after the show he invited Stan Wright &amp; I to supper, which we greatly enjoyed.</p>
<p>Sun. 14.  Had to get up a bit earlier this morning to prepare for the Road again.  Fell in at 9.30 &amp; were issued with Iron rations also 48 hrs. rations to carry us on our Journey.  Before we left the Col. made a nice little speech wishing us "God speed &amp; a safe return" &amp; the crowd sent us off with 3 hearty cheers.  Les Townshend sung out "3 Cheers for the Roan" which we gave with great gusto.  After about an hour's march through about a foot of snow we boarded the Train at Flesselles Station  The snow fell all night &amp; looked very pretty on the roofs of the Houses &amp; on the trees &amp; was a novel sight to many of the crowd.  We travelled 10 in a Carriage, which made us very crowded.  After about 4 hours run in the train we arrived at Beure where we disembarked &amp; marched through the Town on to Ribemont where we camped in what looks like an old Brewery.<br/>The 14th  F.A. were already there.  We are billeted in a loft, about 20 of us, which is very draughty &amp; cold.  "Mac" shouted a bottle of Champagne to celebrate his promotion.</p>
<p>Mon. 15.  Couldn't sleep last night, as it was so jolly cold.  Wrote France &amp; Mother  Sent France Birthday Card.  No duties.  So after Dinner, Mac, Stan Wright &amp; I walked into Buire about 3 miles away, &amp; had a look round the Town.  There were hundreds of German prisoners working on the Roads.  They all look well fed &amp; are quite cheerful.  We can hear the boom of the Guns again quite distinctly.  Went to Bed early, as there is nothing doing in the village &amp; it's too jolly cold to mess around.  This loft is awfully cold &amp; draughty, &amp; Mac &amp; Wrighty &amp; I huddled together in a heap to try &amp; get warm.</p>
