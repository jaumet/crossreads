<p>of a staff  job down here for a while , instructing again, I don't know whether they will keep me for long or whether I will be going back to join the battalion, but I don't think this will suit me for long, and probably I shall be going back in a few weeks. As soon as I rejoin I am sure of my promotion while over this side I am only a temporary rank again.</p>
<p>It is fairly decent here at &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perham Downs we have very good huts to sleep in and the food is real good; it is wonderful how many of my old battalion mates are over here, I think half the old battalion are poking around the different camps.</p>
<p>Well dear Ida I think I'll sign off for this time, I hear we have another big Australian mail in so probably I shall be lucky again<br/>With best and fondest love to Mother, Father the boys and yourself.<br/>Your loving Bro.<br/>Gordon</p>
