<p>My dearest old Tups,</p>
<p>The Bull Boys are at last in town and not having a bad time of it either. Mike is looking fine and I can tell you we are very pleased to be together.  I arrived here three days ago to report for cricket and obtained six days leave as practise is set down for May 1st. Mick has been staying all along with dear old Charlie Patten and seems to be well dug in. Charlie &amp; Mrs Patten have taken a great fancy for your baby boy who carries on just as he did at home and is just as amusing.  Charlie describes Mike as a "real caution" and he and Mick</p>
