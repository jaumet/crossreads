Fell in at 2 pm  & were inoculated for cholera  &  a lecture followed until 4-30 pm &  were dismissed  Of course we made a rush for Cairo, not troubling about leave pass, going from Hellmick Station - fare 1/2 piastre each way  My first impression of Cairo was very different from what I thought the place to be.
