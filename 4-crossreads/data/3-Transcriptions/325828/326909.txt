<p>nestled at the foot of a big range of mountains.<br/>There were factories, all pouring out their black smoke 3 or 4 big docks, bridges spanning the different arms &amp; further out we sighted a train speeding Northwards.<br/>There was a lot of shipping in the Harbour &amp; it was a very strong contrast to what we have been used to since we landed in Egypt.<br/>We hung on until daylight the next morning, when we cast off &amp; headed for Marseilles.  As soon as we got our we struck a very choppy sea, &amp; I think that almost without exception we were all sea-sick   I know that once or twice as I hung over the rail I thought I would bring my heart up.  We were jolly glad when we ran into M. Harbour about 1 o'clock.<br/>We unloaded the horses that afternoon, &amp; on the Wharf I ran into Rid.  I couldn't stay very long but had a yarn for about 5 minutes.  He was looking well &amp; just as lively as ever.  We stayed in that night &amp; picqueted our horses near by &amp; I had the luck to strike it that night.  Was on from 10 till 2 AM. &amp; following day we moved into camp close by.  I went into Marseilles that night &amp; was very favourably impressed with the city.  The buildings are well put up &amp;</p>
