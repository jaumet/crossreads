<p>Dear Mr. Horan<br/>Just a line to let you know that I am still in England and in the best of health.  I had bad luck not seeing George, he marched out of this Camp the day I marched in so I have not seen him yet.  I will be leaving this Camp for France in two or three days time, so I will give you my new address, 10230 S.W. Dickinson, 5th Divisional Supply Column, France.  I will write and let you know how I am getting on and how I like France.  I hope George and I meet over there.  Sam.</p>
