The throb of the engines has awakened many of the boys early this morning.  Reveille sounded at 6 a.m. but things today are somewhat mixed.  On awaking it was impossible to understand for the moment where they were, or what had happened, but the roll of the ship soon reveals to them that they are at sea, and this is their first morning on the briny.  They hop out, roll blankets and hammocks, dress, and make for the troop deck as soon as they can.  The steamer rolls and pitches, and land is nowhere in sight.  Here and there some of the boys feel unwell, and in a very short time a few will be found leaning on the ship's rail looking dismally at the white foam.  Others are sitting around with a look of utter despair on their faces.  Then an unfamiliar sound from our \"cobbo\" at the rail tells us that he is losing last night's tea.  Others join in and it is not long before many teas are lost forever.  Seasickness has become an epidemic.  Bugle calls are ignored, meals are left untouched, men lay around as it were after a charge.  It is a broken army for the time being, but ere long it will awake to new life and vigor.  Only those who have survived the malady, move around and look after their unfortunate comrades, thus proving their true comradeship.  The \"First post\" is sounded, and the hammocks are again swinging on the hooks, with their precious freight.  Before \"Last Post\" and \"Lights out\" are sounded, the boys are again in dreamland, and their first day at sea ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps many times before \"Reveille\" sounds on the morning of the second day, some of the men have been up at the rail again.  Whether that is the case or not, they make the effort to get up and out of the stuffy mess decks to fresh air above.  The epidemic of seasickness is still rampant, consequently the day passes in a somewhat similar manner to its predecessor.  But can one wonder at it, when the old ship swings to and fro on the rolling billows of the Australian Bight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a5676002\"></a> </p>\n<p>[Page 2]</p>\n<p>Friends and relatives line the streets on either side, or walk along with the men to the station.
