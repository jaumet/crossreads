<p>December 1916<br/>plum duff for a week.  Boxing day was cloudy &amp; cold.  At night there was a thunderstorm &amp; heavy rain.  Nearly everybody got wet as their bivouacs are made more for sun shelter than for rain.  I was lucky having a little old canvas tent which let in a bit of water but nothing much to worry about.</p>
<p>Christmas week was very miserably spent on account of the rain wind &amp; cold.  As soon as the rain dries the sand swirles everywhere with cutting fury  There has been little sun &amp; the horses have been feeling the cold severely.  We got a rum issue on the last day of the year, &amp; the only one we had during the year issued.  An Australian &amp; English mail arrived on New Year's day.  I got 5 letters altogether which is a bit of a record for me  Have been putting in the last few days drawing some maps of the Turco-Egyptian frontier on a smaller scale so that they will carry easier in the pocket.</p>
