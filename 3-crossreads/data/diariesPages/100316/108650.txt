in squashy little caps. One presented arms with funny movements. Rode after the battalion and caught it up. The perch pole of A. Co. cooker had broken and capsized their tea. The cooks refilled out of the River Somme and boiled up a fresh supply. On the pleasant shady banks outside Heilly we spread the men about for rest, the Band played and they had their tea. Met General McNicoll here and had a yarn to him. He has a German messenger dog as a pet. It was captured some weeks ago and has become quite an Australian by now. Rode back to Franvillers . From the high part of the road one can look right into the Boche lines in parts. Corbie lies in a hollow and Villers Brettoneux is on top of a rise. Back in Franvillers I found the Q.M. store and found that we were well located for a mess and for officers quarters. On the premises is a good looking Madame and two girls ? one of 20 and one of 15 ? both rather powdered and I think a little easy of virtue. This remains to be seen. Yarned with Madame and found that she had stayed when the Australians commenced to arrive. She ran the English down to the ground and the girls did so too. No praise is too high for the Australians. In Italy I saw the hatred of England grow and here in France the same feeling seems to be commencing. After mess we yarned until 11 and the Brazenor and myself found a good billet at Rear Bde HQ located in a fine and comfortable 2 ? storey place.
