Friday 7
Route March to Railway Bridge, evidently the natives have not too good an opinion of us. Several women and girls standing in a group yarning and on catching sight of us they grabbed all their fowls and ducks within reach and "got" for their lives. Niggers still hard at work digging pits for guns. 7th Engineers arrive on the scene with their menagerie, 1 kangaroo, 1 possum, 2 dogs and 1 cat. Weather still windy and cold. Cable from Kitchener "Wishing Happy New Year"
Saturday 8
3 warships passed "Glory" Minerva" towards Suez "H.M.S, Jupiter" towards Pt. Said. Saw my first operation Arab with smashed hand. Doctors sewed tendon together. Ticklish job, Anaesthetic made me feel squarmish. Weather brightens up, sun shone all day. 7th Engineeers active, building landing stages, etc. Niggers on strike again for more Rations.

Sunday 9th
Church Parade, Good singing, Russian National Anthem, sounds well when sung by few hundred soldiers. Paid visit to Arab farm, kiddies on catching sight of us flew for their lives, but on seeing us in conversation with the elderly Arab, their pluck returned and they buzzed round us with their eternal cry "Baksheesh" pretty little kids too, Arab shewed us round the farm. Waterwheel (the same style as used two thousand years ago) pulled round by an old cow, blindfold, also plow, drawn by two cows, just a log of wood sharpened one end. Boy made us a present of peanuts. The Arab women no matter how dirty all have their faces veiled.
