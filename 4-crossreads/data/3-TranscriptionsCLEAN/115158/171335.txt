1915
Sept. 29  Sept. 30
September, when we left for Scapa Flow to carry out gunnery & torpedo exercises. There was little fresh at Scapa Flow, with the exception of a few new additions to our already powerful Battle Fleet.  Here we heard that the most successful destroyer of German submarines, was a new type of ship which was allowed to roam the seas at will, to change her flag as convenient, & alter the colour of her funnels, and even change her name as often as she wished.  Also she had hinged sides which could be hinged down to the level of the deck.  Behind these hinged sides were several quick firing guns.  The crew were were dressed after the fashion of a nondescript merchant service crew.  When ordered to stop by a hostile submarine, she would heave to, & when a favourable opportunity presented itself, down would go the sides & every gun would blaze forth, much to Fritz's surprise & disgust.  In this way many German submarines had their career unexpectedly cut short.

After completing our exercises, we left for Cromarty, a journey of only 5 hours, & here we waited for 3 days until it was clear enough to carry out long range firing, in company with the "Queen Elizabeth".

This completed, we left for Rosyth.  A few hours out from Cromarty, 5 strange vessels were sighted
