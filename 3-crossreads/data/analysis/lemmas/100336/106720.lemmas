 We made good progress that night despit the heavi rain and dark . This is where our littl compass came in again . We took a direct cours to where we knew the old raod from Tarsus to Gelebek ran . I had had previous experi on this track dure "mi last escape" . Just after daylight we reach the first of the hill and the rain had stop and it look like clear up for good . About 9 a.m. sun came out so we took our cloth off and hung it on bush to dri . That sun was glorious but what we need now was food , we were raven . Then we start off toward where we knew the track was . We reach this about 1 p.m. We then had about 15 mile to do to Gelebek . We start off along the road pass a few Turk who took veri littl notic of us . We eventu reach Gelebek about 6 p.m. Cullen who had been work under the English Doctor at the Hospit went direct to the Hospit and report to Captain Clifford who said that he had not yet been report as be away . Samson and my self who were work for the German Militari had been miss the day after we had gone . Of cours we were taken befor the German Command who want to know where we had been and whi .

We were allow a littl under half a pound of bread per day , and unless we had a bottl to hold water , we would have to go without a drink for 8 or 9 hour . We were allow out for 5 minut in the morn and 5 minut at night . It did not matter what happen we could not get out at ani other time .
