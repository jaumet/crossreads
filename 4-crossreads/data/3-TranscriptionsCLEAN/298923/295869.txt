  
 22 July 1918 Monday (X to X crossed out) X Recd. Mothers & Joes letters of May 26 & I note all the Contra Temps still Joes cable "sailed" means he has gone.   I am sorry in a way- for your sakes. X Just got marching orders for another Sector nearer the Coast:  move tomorrow X Am afraid Joe will find George Reid a broken REED & a back number in England now as he like old Sir Sam is in his dotage-  Hope Joe managed Mardi wedding cake X
