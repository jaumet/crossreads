<p>Finished the reading of another of George Birmingham's "Lalage's Lovers", a good reading, a book in the manner of Lewis Baumer's drawing the 'Nuts'!  "General John Regan" I read some while ago.</p>

No mail again.  Wrote &ndash; this time for posting &ndash; letter to Mother.</p>
<p>Reading Swinburne's "Eve of Revolution".  Talking to one of the Kookaburras who had come around for dressings, spoke of Frank D. and cartooning.  F. to go around some day after today as its probable some Kookaburra cartoons may appear in one of the early 'Aussy' numbers.</p>

<p>63.<br/>This morning on S. Parade, a lot of Artillery men &ndash; colds:  husky spoken, from gas.  Diagnosed by M.O. as colds on chest!  Talking to one tonight who'd come back for inhalation, find him to be of the company of the Trench Mortars gun the Boche scored a direct hit on the night of the advance of March last.  The two left of the crew, Capt. Drummond and myself dressed at Edwards Post.  Pendlebury died later.</p>
