When I've finished I put on my cap & clear away from the place, up on to the Hills & awa'.  I then forget all worries & come back able to sleep well & in a happy mood.  I have dozens of letters to answer & write but I absolutely cannot do it.  After trying to get leave for a month Dave & I have at last been granted 4 days.
