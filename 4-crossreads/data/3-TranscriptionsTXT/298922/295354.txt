Some Yeomanry relieve us today & we go back to El Arish for a bit of a spell. Fortunately a Camel died so we can offer them some fresh meat!!!
The seasons are reversed here you know this - mid winter now & cold at night but lovely days. Outposts are cold work but we like to think that the Light Horse are always in the front line & have been for 1 year & 9 months, beyond a months spell while I was away in England.
Bedouin implements are even more crude than Egyptians - Harrow - piece of wood with stone pegs - Wooden Plows etc. The well we are using is one of 7 between here & Palestine put down by ? don't know how many years ago.
