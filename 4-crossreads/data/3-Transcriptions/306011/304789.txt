<p>At the rate we are going the war will never be over. The Russians have been forced back, also the Italians and we can't do good in the bad weather on this front. The Germans are without doubt the strongest military power after three years of war and if we want to do any good we shall have to get hold of more modern methods. England still thinks that one Englishman is worth three foreigners and is trying to win on old British tradition &ndash; all this is quite played out.
