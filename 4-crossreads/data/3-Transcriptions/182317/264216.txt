<p>Judges' Chambers, Supreme Court, Sydney. 17 May 1916<br/>My dear lad, You are starting a very great adventure at last, and I wish I knew how to say half the things <strike>I</strike> that are in my heart. You don't need to be told of the love that will follow you round the world &ndash; from Arthur, Father &amp; Sister. It must be a long time before, in the happiest circumstances, we can hope to have you with us again, but there will not be a day of it in which you &amp; Arthur will not be continually in our thoughts. We shall be often</p>
