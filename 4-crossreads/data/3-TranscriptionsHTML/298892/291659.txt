<p>Peace appears to be somewhere in sight now and in all probability I will spend next Xmas at home again.<br/>I can't tell half the items of interest on account of the censor but I will certainly have plenty of interesting things to tell you when I return.<br/>With best love to all at home &amp; next door.<br/>Your loving Son,<br/>Eugene.</p>
