 Beautiful days & cold frosty nights bright starlight & endless desert very like Western NSW in Winter. [Following paragraph is crossed out] Omit :  Received mails more regularly now- letters from Mother  Dec.3 Nyle Ritchie same date , also papersMy address is now Capt. A Squadron,  not  Head Quarters  now  The good folk at home should send NO more Winter clothing or Soks for some time the men have plenty & by the time this is received & answered say 2 months, the Winter will be over & the heat begun again. People have been wonderfully good at sending us Soldiers Comforts
