<p>Bazentin<br/>15/3/17<br/>of La Boisselle &ndash; an enormous hole which penetrates deep into the chalk.  Many must have been killed by this explosion as there are monuments of wood close by to the Colonel and many men of the Tyneside Scottish. The old trenches criss cross hereabouts and there is much barbed wire in the ground.  Accidents due to detonation of duds owing to some blow are common.  A few days ago Evans buried some arms and legs lying hereabouts &ndash; relics of the last fight.</p>
<p>Met Willis and drove up to the QM's store at Bazentin where the railhead is.  Locomotives heavy and light, puffing in the yards and salvage men at work on the dumps.  Met Miles and received bundle of letters and orders to remain with QM.  The poor chaps have had a devil of a time in, 10 days now and no rest and the Bosche fighting his way back.  Corne's body recovered.  Massey missing.  Read and wrote all the afternoon in tent which is comfortable.</p>
