<p>Early on the morning of the 25th we pushed on again and came up with the NZ&#39;s in truck with the Turks, a few miles this side of Ammon so we turned off to the left and got down onto the railway line a bit north of the station. The country out there is rolling stony hills of red soil with pretty steep wadis in places running down to the Wadi Ammon. Just as we got with-in sight of the railway line a turkish convoy of camp <s>b</s>&nbsp;cookeries and bakeries etc was going north along the road; so our MG&#39;s hopped in and shot their horses and captured about 100 turks from whom we got some valuable information. Well! the rest of the afternoon we kept in touch with the Turks - we had no artillery and the turks had one</p>
