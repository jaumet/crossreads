Sunday 19 August
2 runs to Bailleul.  In the 2nd run, at Pradelles 5 kilos from Hazebrouck I smashed into a Flying Corps Cycle & Side Car.  He was on his wrong side of the road & neither of us had lights due to aircraft overhead.  3 bombs were dropped not far from the road I was taking.  My bike had the front wheel badly mangled, the headspring broken & front fork slightly bent.  The other party had their turnout completely wrecked.  I walked to Strazeele, got a lift from this village to Bailleul & delivered my message, then rang up for an ambulance to come up to convey me home.
