<p>* I didn't tell you &ndash; Capt Lloyd was sent back from the ship very ill with Typhoid &ndash; may not get better &ndash; broken hearted at leaving his men - who have been in action since &ndash;<br/>6 &ndash; mournful and very ill &ndash; and has gone to England &ndash; also Major Kent Hughes who is an old friend of Mrs S.S. and whose wife Aunt Lucy introduced me to has gone away with dysentery. A young man called de Crespigny who is the senior Lt Col because he has been in the military so long is A.O.C. He is only 33 and never been out of Australia before, is very knowledgeful and keen about his old family &ndash; has a son of 10 years old &ndash; and rarely smiles. He is looking after captain Lloyd * and I hope will see him through &ndash; tonight the boy is much worse. His pulse is very weak and I'm awfully anxious about him. I have written two letters to his mother for him. The last time I wrote he was slightly better. The 1st Brigade to which he belongs made an attack the other night and they say gained two trenches but were badly cut up. I wonder if Geoffrey Street is alright and Captain Thompson. It's just hear rending &ndash; one feels as if one cant bear any more and yet one has to go on bearing fresh horrors and sadnesses. It is four months since Archie was killed and I came here. It seems like a life time</p>
