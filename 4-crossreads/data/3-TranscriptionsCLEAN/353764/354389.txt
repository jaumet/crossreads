  
 upon arrival here he did not know any of us & was very bad.  We eventually got him back to Hospital where he now is very bad. Heard pretty definitely that we are to go to France in two months time. Only a routine day, never left the lines. 
 28.1.16 To-day proved a very good one in the History of our Company.  We were reviewed at 2.30 pm by Major General Birdwood.  He is indeed a very nice man, & all the troops over here speak very highly of him.  He spoke a few words to me & I shall always remember them. Our fellows received another mail to-day, but as usual none for me. Played Cricket the remainder of the afternoon & this compiled with the fact that we stood at attention for 2 hours, has made me very tired, so intend turning in very early.  I am feeling very rotten on account of not getting any mail, as this is all one has to look forward to over here.
