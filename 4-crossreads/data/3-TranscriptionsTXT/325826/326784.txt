4.  There is another delivery about 10 o'clock to-night &amp; I shall leave this open just in case there may be a letter from Rid or Le by it that has been delayed, though even if there is it will be only a tiny scrap I can add for I must post this to-night- the pillar-box is only across the road fortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is eight o'clock now &amp; there is a huge hot dinner to toy with, isn't it mad.  One night we were given ice-cream for dessert!  By the way Mother dearie, I thought of this this-afternoon.  If you hear of me coming sailing homewards &amp; you want any curtains for my room, please use some of tassely ones that were in that box of linen stuff, I fully intended them to be used, also anything else that there may be of any use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is my "blue" corner in the garden Father?Later. The last delivery has been made &amp; there is nothing else dear people mine so I will close this &amp; post.Very very much love fromYour loving daughterOlive.
