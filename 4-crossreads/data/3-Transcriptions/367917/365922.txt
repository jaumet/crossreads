<p>I have not been through the bazaar here. Silk seems to be the main item in it &ndash; this being one of <u>the</u> silk manufacturing centres. The effect produced is very fine but you never saw such outfits as are used. They mainly consist of bits of string, shoelace, &amp; any old thing tied &amp; pieces together. Yet they work wonderfully quickly &amp; accurately &amp; the material is very good, at least as far as I can judge. The price I fancy is good also but that is only because they know what a poor Silly Crowd we are &amp; want to make as much as possible out of us while we're here.</p>
<p>So far I have not bought anything &ndash; I have to retrieve after my loss of field glasses etc at Damascus. I suppose the first time I get into the bazaar though I shall get fleeced. It is just looking like raining all night so I shall lie me to bed.</p>
<p>My best regards to Mrs Ferguson and yourself from<br/>Yours very Sincerely<br/>R.J. Hunter</p>
