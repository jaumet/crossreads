<p>17th March<br/>St Patricks Day. ABU-TIG.</p>
<p>Camped last night in a large enclosure probably the local market place. The villagers had never seen soldiers before &amp; and their wonder was great Crowds of them hang around and are quickly dispersed by the Egyptian Police but they are like cattle the come back for another look at these strange "Askari" (Soldiers) The are very much interested in all our doings they watch all our movements like so many hawks. although they are very peaceful and harmless but nevertheless they are embarrassing  You tell them "Imshee" (Clear Out) They go away for a few yards and then when more newcomers arrive on the scene they push forward again. These Native police have a very effective way of dealing with them. They simply slog into them &ndash; Age or sex no bar &ndash; with a green hide riding whip They fly in all directions And the loud rustle of those skirts which they all wear make a noise like a flock of birds suddenly flying up</p>
