 My dear Uncle Phil 
 It is with the deepest regret I am now writing to you to give what few details I have been able to gather about poor Laurence's death.  We were attacked on the morning of the 19th inst: by the Turks about 4 a.m. and it was about this time  roughly that Laurence was killed.  I am told that Laurence was - in keeping his men in good spirits and directing their fire - exposing himself and not in the least worrying about any danger.  When daylight came the enemy were able to direct their machine guns on us & it was then I understand Laurence met his death.  I never heard anything about it until the following day, so was awfully cut up at not having a chance of going to the funeral.  I went down and saw his grave & on it was a bunch of wild flowers which the Padre told me had been placed there by the men of his company who I might mention were very fond
