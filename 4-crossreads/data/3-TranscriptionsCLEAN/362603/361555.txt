  
 Bulford 5/12/17 Dear Dad, I am just answering Your 3 letters of 30 Sept 7 & 14th October.  I have written to Mum & it is getting on for 10 p.m. now.  But I don't finish Duty till 11 p.m.  I've just had my Supper of Soup & Toast.  I feel quite O.K.  I have been doing a fair amount of cycling & walking lately & I am feeling fit.  You talk about driving Home in the cool of the evening.  It seems impossible to think of any evening being anything else but cool.  I don't find it necessary to wear woollen underpants over here & sometimes for a fortnight we never have the Thermometer higher than freezing point.  I never got to London, Dad.  I pass through on the way to Douglas but I leave London at 4 pm before the Raiders come over.  It is too cold on the fingers & toes to go to Salisbury on the Bike now.  It may snow too & I don't want to ride Home in the snow.  Salisbury is like Home almost to me.  I know all the shops & I meet dozens of people that I nod to.  If I happen to go in to the Town & not go to my Friends, someone will have seen me & tell them all about where I have been.  It is a fairly big Town too.  I often go for a walk with Mr Edmonds who is my other Salisbury Friend.  He is a very nice man.  It is He who works in the Carpet Factory.  He & His wife can never do enough for Ellis & I & they are only hard working people.  I generally visit both places when I go to Sarum.  I play the piano sometimes but I am sadly in need of regular practice.
