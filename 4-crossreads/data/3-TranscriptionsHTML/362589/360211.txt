<p><u>Lieutenant A. G. Ferguson, 20th Battalion</u></p>
<p>My Dear Judge,</p>
<p>I have just received the following cable from our agents in Cairo - -</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Ferguson, 20th Battalion, convalescent, Alexandria, 5th October".</p>
<p>This caries the news of your son a little beyond what you had already received, but we afraid that it may not perhaps give you the address that you are anxious to obtain. We hope, however, that it may relieve your mind of anxiety about your son, as he is evidently getting on all right.<br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><u>Langeil Evans</u></p>
<p>The Hon. Mr Justice Ferguson,<br/>Judges' Chambers,<br/>Supreme Court,<br/>SYDNEY.</p>
