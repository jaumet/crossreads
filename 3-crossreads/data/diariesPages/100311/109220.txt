10/10/17 Broodseinde
12.10 am. Bunning rang up to say that he had evacuated his places on account of being surrounded. I leave it to his judgment entirely. He says SkeneSmith is dead. Poor young mother and her 3 weeks old baby. Keith Anderson is in a dugout up forward with a bullet in his knee. Dooley probably dead in some shell hole. A merry game! The evening was quiet and gave us an opportunity to re-organize and get the relief in. Probably the enemy all doing the same. All our folk unanimous as to the utter inefficiency of the barrage on this flank. Slept until about 8 a.m. when K Anderson arrived with a bullet right through his leg but still very cheerful. They were cut up by m.g. fire and only about 6 reached their objective which they had later to evacuate. Vickers gun blown to pieces and two Lewis Guns also lost. Men trickling in bullets in heads bodies ? bad for the chaps lying in shell holes.
