Mediterranean Expeditionari Forc in Egypt . ani price from 5 Piastr down for an ordinari cane but if you tell them it is no good , and off 2 Piastr they general accept , if you are not carri a cane each one that you meet follow tri to persuad you to buy one . Our Camp is not as I expect to find it on Sand , it is more like a mixtur of Sand clay and beat down veri hard , the camp is kept " Scrupul " I dont think that is spelt " correct " clean , and in front of each tent the men are build low parapett they just dig out some of the sand clay mixtur of which I spke . and puddl it up then stamp it in between two plank and there you are . when these parrapett are white wash they look nice . some of the tent have design in front of them perhap a shield with number of Batt etc . done with littl round pebbl . some a Rough copi of the Aus . Coat of Arms . they look veri nice , and they men take a lot of interest in their differ design ,
