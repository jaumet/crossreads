nasty fire on us for a while in the evening, one shell lobbed just behind my dugout, & as it only has a sheet of galvanised iron on top, another 5 yards & it would have "been good night nurse". He spread them about too, but nobody was hit. Went out digging as usual, had to deepen a trench, & as we finished & had our work passed, we were allowed to come home in groups of 10 without waiting for the whole company, & my mate & I were back before 1 a.m. Tuesday 11 June Had a sleep till the tea & bacon came up at 3 a.m., & then slept till dinner time. In the afternoon I did a lot of writing, sent the postcards I salvaged to Min, Mone, Elsie, Will & Dorothy, & wrote letters to Bon & Kathleen Tofft. We didn't go out digging tonight. Wedn. 12 June  Breakfast 6 a.m. & we set off with the old pick & shovel once more down the road through a village with everything smashed by shells as usual, & came to our job. We had to dig a trench 6 feet deep to lay a cable in. It was a filthy job, first of all, insects were sucking blood from our arms, & getting in one's eyes & ears, & about 4 or 5 feet down the ground held water & was muck
