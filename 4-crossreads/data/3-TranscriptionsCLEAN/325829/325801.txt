Turkish deserters were continually coming in to camp in small parties, or giving themselves up to our Patrols. 
 On Set 17th Major A.G.Bolingbroke D.S.O. was severely wounded whilst on patrol, one man killed, one man reported missing , one man wounded. These casualties to our patrols were the result of good fire discipline on the part of the enemy.
