8/11/17 Paris
Did not rise until 8.30. There is now hot water every day and all day here. Went by tube, in uniform, to the Gare du Nord and took ticket for Calais tonight. Returned via Gare d?Est and there found a woman run over and the trains dropped. She was tangled up in the machinery but still alive and making much noise. The fire brigade sent a part to get her out. A whitefaced crowd ? but as a Frenchman said to me ?Life is cheap these days". So I left with him and he directed me to a tram that ran me down to the Opera. Bought some papers from the old woman at the corner kiosk of the Bde. des Italiens and then walked down to the A.P.M's office. Took tube at the Tuileries and was back at Alma by 11.30. The Elysee is quite full of people and tres chic. For lunch went up to Cafe de la Paix and had a light meal. Then took tube at the Opera for Chateau Rouge and walked from there ?marching on the map" to the Church
