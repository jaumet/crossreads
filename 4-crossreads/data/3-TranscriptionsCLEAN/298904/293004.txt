  
 There are some very lovely wild flowers growing on the penisular in the Spring time, & there is plenty of wild thyme & margery grows on the ridge's  we used to use the last 2 for seasoning our bully beef rissoles, & they were very nice when fried the only difficulty was getting firwood for there was scarcely a stick there we even used to grub up the roots & burn them. Len had a good job for some time before we left the penisular he was recommended for Battalion sniper, & got it, he had a splendid rifle she was fitted up with telescopic sights by Purdey & Son, in England, he did a bit of damage with her during the short time she was in action
