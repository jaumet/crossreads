<p>Sunday 1 September<br/>Nothing doing here at Morcourt which is now miles from the war.  In fact we can't hear the guns &amp; can only just see the balloons.</p>
<p>Monday 2 September<br/>A walk this afternoon to Proyart from where our division hopped off last stunt.<br/>There are now two C.C.S.'s there now. Saw a number of German guns including three 5.9 navals in position. Changeable weather. On our front Mont St. Quentin &amp; Peronne have been taken.</p>
