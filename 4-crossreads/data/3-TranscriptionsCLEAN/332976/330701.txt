May 1916.Nothing exciting has happened but I have had a good look around & visited Cairo on Saturday 13th & saw the Pyramids & Sphinx.The water at Tel-el-Kibir is not of the best although there is plenty of it & if drunk in excess will cause dysentry.  At Tel-el-Kibir 35,000 troops (Aust & Eng. & N.Z.) were camped most of which were Australians who will leave with us tonight or tomorrow.  At Serapium, on the canal 17,000 (Aust & Eng.) are camped in readiness for an attack.  A few scrapes with the Turks have been had there lately & it is only about 25 miles from where we were.  On the 19th inst. I was appointed on the staff temporily & will continue to draw extra full duty pay.  About the 10th, about 14 of the officers from the School arrived here & take up duties here.
