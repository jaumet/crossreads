"quite at sea" in more ways than one at times almost crouching down to ground with the violent gusts. Lightning showed way to mess and getting inside found the floor of the mess tent a bog. Puttees boots socks wringing wet. Cooks working under great difficulties but all looked forward to at least a good hot cup of tea. Presently a crash denoted the cook's tent blown down and we had a little cold meat. Rum neat was the only available drink so went dry. At 2000 waded up to tent in gully and found tent still standing but floor too wet to sleep on. Got into E.P. tent among crowd of batmen details c with Lieut Terry and slept fairly well considering. Smell of unwashed men very strong ? soldiering indeed gives us some strange bedfellows!

Up at 0700 and down to wharf Boat sailed but only took about 50 cases leaving rest. Saw Capt Stow at Canteen he advised no chance of transport until 1800 so took things easy.
Wearing wet boots puttees and socks no joke. Raining still ? Mon Dieu! was ever such a god forsaken place as Kephalos. Turkish prisoners under guard some tough looking cases too. Funeral of two men killed yesterday in aeroplane accident Walked over to hangars and had good look over the different planes there 
Very simple they look, but the engines are wonderful. Glass floors to observe thro?
