  
 5 March 1918 Tuesday (X to X crossed out) X Arrived last night at No.14 R.F.C. doing Contact Patrols & will have a fly every day for the next 3 days, joining Brigade on the March- R.F.C. Mess very comfortable & a good lot of young bloods. X  Am too old to think of joining the Flying Corps- This aerodrome is at J.S. & I had the pleasure of being up with 6 other machines all nicely loaded with BOMBS for the Turks  on the Jordan    One can judge country well from up above & someday a manager outback will have a look round before breakfast in his monoplane-   All TYPES are here & we are top dog in the air on this front.
