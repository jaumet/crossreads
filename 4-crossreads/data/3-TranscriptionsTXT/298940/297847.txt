Friday 15th Feb. 18On guard last night, but very easy - nothing doing. Actually I spent five minutes on the post, first, joining there at 10 pm (my spell started at 2 AM). I found darkness & mud outside & darkness & chewing horses inside the stable. The first relief had gone off & the second was in bed.     X     x     x     xRose at revile & spent the morning in writing a burlesque and doing some washing. The burlesque is first a short one in preparation for the next concert.
