<p>glad to say that I am feeling tip-to, and now that I shall soon have my commission the life as a soldier will not be quite so hard.  I sent along a cable home, as soon as I landed here a few days ago, just to let you know that I was safe, and also, as I will be in need of some money. I daresay dad, you will think I want a deuce of a lot, well to tell the truth I do need a good bit for a start, you know I have to keep myself in everything, and live as any officer does, all on my usual pay until the completion of the training course, of course then I will get my Officers allowance of a guinea a day, and will soon be able to pull, what money I spend now in training</p>
