<p>Wednesday, 3 March, 1915<br/>Another big divisional sham fight resulting in a win for our brigade, my arm was too sore to allow me to ride so I went out as [indecipherable] on an ambulance waggon, and we were in the one position all day so I coiled up &amp; went to sleep.  My lecture on Henry Lawson and his life was a big success in the Y.M.C.A.  Col. Plane presided and I got a splendid reception from the big audience, as well as lecturing I recited a few of Lawsons poems which were applauded so well that it attracted a large audience.  Col Werrington then asked me to recite my own composition "Thoughts of Home" and the audience then demanded the Emden, which as usual got a splendid reception.</p>
<p>Thursday, 4 March, 1915.<br/>My pony had been bad with colic all night so I was told off to watch him in the morning whilst the others exercised horses.</p>
<p>We have a N.Z dentist with us now and he is doing our work first, I went down to him this morning and had four old stumps out, as they are only liable to ache whilst away on service.</p>
<p>I rode an old spare horse named "stiff-legs" and led another in the p.m and had the roughest ride since I left Australia.  Of all the most useless brutes I have ridden this is easily the worst.  On picquet at night very quiet, lovely moonlight night.</p>
