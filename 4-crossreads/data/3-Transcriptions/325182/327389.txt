<p>Major <strike>Anderson</strike> Lucas from the 56th Bn. has taken charge of our Bn.  Mr. Paliner has been appointed Adjutant.  Major Jack of our Bn. has also been killed which brings the total "losses" in officers up to date to 7.</p>
<p>Col. McConaghy has died from the terrible wounds which he received and was buried this morning in Pusigny.  Capt. Lovatt was buried in Aubigny.  We are too callous these days to be able to realize the extent of our losses.</p>
