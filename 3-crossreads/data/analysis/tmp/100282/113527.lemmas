What a time we had on the way home for just as we were clear Bailleul a fright snowstorm broke it beat in our face the whole way home , we were near frozen to death cover with snow from head to foot , it was easili the coldest drive I ever rememb I do n't want mani more like it took a good hour to get proper thaw warm again . 3rd Still veri cold miser , snow lie all over the ground no sign of the sun , this cold snap will give the veget a bit of a check for encourag by the mild winter , everyth is shoot bud like wild fire , give promis of a veri earli Spring in place the hedg were begin to show a faint ting of green
