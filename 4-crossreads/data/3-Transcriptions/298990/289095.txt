<p>Dernacourt 29/11/16 About 6pm the Staff Captain came round with an invitation to dinner and things at Brigade HQ were being done in fine style.  The General was away but RS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took his place ably supported by Colonels Forbes and Brazenor.  The B.M and the rest of the staff were en force and it was a merry gathering.  Pope [indecipherable] frowned down from the wall on frisky subs and a very decent interpreter while the wine flowed freely.  Champagne and Benedictine were consumed with gusto and many reverend seniors unbent.  Col. Freddy blinked owlishly &amp; Dr [indecipherable] supplied the comic relief.  All carried home a mixed cargo and carefully deposited same on the gardens at billets.</p>
<p>30/11/16  Cold and dull.  Parade drill etc.  German prisoners cage close by.  Had to keep men moving all the time to keep them reasonably warm.  Transport moved.  On parade grounds watching drill it was bitterly cold.  Rifle exercises were splendidly smart and plenty of drill quips.  In the evening Guel's Company ("D") gave a concert in the YMCA hut and it went very well.  Some good talent was brought to light and everything went with a swing after some blindfold boxing bouts had taken place.  Much ragtime and some good songs.  The Australian soldier is a very sentimental bloke and loves to sing ballads of roses on graves death stricken hearts etc.  One chap recited "The Man from Snowy River" very well and Podgy K's  ragtime batman ragged.  A piano had been borrowed and brought down on a handcart. Altogether quite a good turnout and a break in the monotony.  Reaching billets orders for tomorrow's entrainment were waiting.</p>
