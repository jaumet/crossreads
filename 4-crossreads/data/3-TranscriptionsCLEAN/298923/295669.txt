3 January 1918 ThursdayJust before leaving Moascar I wandered into a Kitchener Hut & was surprised to see in large letters presented by Deniliquin & old Ernie Tim Armstrong from Gunbar in charge.  Have asked him to post you a photo of it.  Did I tell you the Arra[indecipherable] has been torpedoed outside Alex  That was the boat I went to Italy on, every boat except the Malta we travelled on is now down.
