<p>Feb 2nd [1917] Our Captain proceeded to the Admiralty so as to make arrangements about leave etc.<br/>Feb 7th  One half of the men proceeded on 21 days leave at 2 P.M. It was evidently plain that we were going to be modernised as rigging of the foremast was soon being dismantled with a view of placing a tripod mast in the ship, and very many other alterations were being made both internally and externally, - full advantage of this refit was being taken both by the men and the ship<br/>March 2nd  at 8 am. the 1st watch returned from their long leave, and the remainder of the men then proceeded on their 21 days leave &ndash; fairly good weather was prevailing and an enjoyable time was looked for &ndash; During the absence of the last named men it was found necessary to prolong our time allowed for refitting indefinitely, consequently each man then on leave received a telegram to extend his leave for an additional 7 days making a total of 28 days<br/>March 31st  The above men returned to the ship</p>
