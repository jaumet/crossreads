I recognize more to day than ever before what a grand thing it is to be English. the drop of French blood in my veins is just about boiling with patriotism at such a pitch needless to say I feel like something chained up, would like to go with the 20,000 lucky ones if they go, but its no use I'm out of it. for the while at least.
Not long ago you were wondering if those gone before were able to look down on the earth and see what was doing.If such is the case. Just imagine what a noble lot of barrackers the British fleet will have surely those noblemen of Devon will fight again, for the grand old empire they helped to build.
I understand why Britain went to war but why Germany did is what I want to know. I don't think it is going to be a walkover for any concerned what a pity it is that the big bear can't get started quicker. I am sure that they would be more at home than they were in Manchuria. I think myself William must have been counting his soldiers and on getting to two and 1/8 millions he must ha become overcome with pride decided to give his mighty armies work. if this is so he deserves to go financially and otherwise broke while I which him no ilwill it would be comforting to me at least to know that his navy was any how save floating.
I don't think I mention in my letter to betty that the seeds came to hand ok are now up. very many thanks on this account.
