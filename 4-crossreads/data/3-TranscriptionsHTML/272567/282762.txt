<p>4/11/18 Yzeux<br/>A day in bed. Bazeley went over to Flesselles to a platoon demonstration with me. The chief excitement was the visit of Brg. John Muirhead of the 6 Field Ambulance who gave me as thorough an overhauling as ever doctor gave patient. He said I want a change and spoke of a touch of anaemia !? Later on he sent up a nursing orderly who brought a Primus and bandages and who is to look after me.</p>
<p>5/11/18 A very wet day. Remained in bed. First visitor was General Robinson who made much  ado about nothing and argued the point. Dr Jno Muirhead came next. Steady dull rain all day.</p>
<p>6/11/18. Wet again. Dr Muirhead &amp; the G. called in the afternoon. 31 21st men who were posted to 5th Bn came back to 24 today and left their Div. Put them all under open arrest. They returned late alright.</p>
