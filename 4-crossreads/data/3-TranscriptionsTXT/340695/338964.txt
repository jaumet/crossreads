 Am receiving a good many Xmas cards but only one of my home parcels have turned up so far. 19-12/16. Freezingly cold; Snow began falling about 3 pm &amp; in no time everywhere was white. It is a grand sight to see the white flakes fluttering to the ground. I stood out in it for quite a time. Hope it snows Xmas day. 25-12-16. Spent a very enjoyable Xmas considering. Had a splendid spread in the officers mess room. Nuts &amp; sweets of every description adorned the oval table. A juicy roast &amp; green peas substituted Turkey finishing up with Plum Pudding jellied blanc mange preserved fruit &amp; cream &amp; had as much as one could eat. I was elected to sit at the head in the arm chair.
