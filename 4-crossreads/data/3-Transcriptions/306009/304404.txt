<p>1915<br/>Aug. 8 Sun.<br/>Visited the Armenian Boy Scouts at their Headquarters in the Armenian School (Kasr-el-Nil) at 2.30 p.m. About 70 boys in 2 Troops (A &amp; B) &amp; very smart.  All orders given in English which is spoken well by the S.M. &amp; his Assistant (the latter speaks 6 languages fluently). These Scouts are distinguishable by violet neckerchiefs &amp; are the best I have yet seen in Cairo. They wear English equipment &amp; work on B.S.A. lines.<br/>Attended Evening Service at All Saints' at which I struck Willie Vane.</p>
