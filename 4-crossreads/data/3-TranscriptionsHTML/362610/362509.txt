<p>Friday 20 October 1916<br/>Fine &amp; beautifully clear. During the morning got some Xmas cards purchased yesterday addressed &amp; by lunch time got packed up, immediately afterwards pushing off on horseback to St. Omer to act as Bde. Entraining Officer. This meant a fair amount of attendance at the station, but with the Bde. H.Q. staff went up to an hotel for dinner &amp; later on fixed up for a room at the Y.M.C.A. where are beds, baths, billiard rooms, reading room, breakfast room, etc. Greatly enjoyed a good hot bath. Had only broken sleep &amp; not too much of that. Again a heavy frost.</p>
