<p>1919<br/>April<br/>&amp; Rachel (two loose women).  Helene had a boy by a German soldier &amp; another baby expected.  Rachel had nothing, but it was not her fault.  They also had two rooms upstairs.  Two of our men undertook to keep Helene &amp; Rachel warm at night, &amp; Don McKinnon &amp; a couple of others slept in the other room.  I don't know where Madame &amp; the child fitted in.  Don was disgusted but could not get away as our billet was full, &amp; apart from their morals they were kind enough, &amp; he did not want to hurt their feelings by leaving them &amp; going elsewhere. Madame Jean Baptiste had the back room &amp; a room upstairs.  She was the exact opposite of the other crowd, &amp; was neat, clean &amp; dressed her children, Robert &amp; the little girl, well.  Marie, a dirty little urchin of about 5, from the front room became attached to me, &amp; used to come in after tea to sing La Madelon.  I don't how she kept warm as she never wore anything but a short dress &amp;</p>
