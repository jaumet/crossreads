<p>not writing this without having given the matter a thought, on the contrary I cannot get it out of my head, &amp; I fully realize what mother's feelings must be;  but surely when she hears that out of the mothers of those I have already mentioned, one, who has only just lately lost her husband, is giving three sons, &amp; another is sending a son to fight her own brother, she will at least reconsider the question.  And then looking at it from the point of view of my future life, I have enough self respect not to wish to be referred to as an officer with a certain amount of experience, who funked it when it came to the point, an officer who evidently joined for the sake of a uniform.  I have also considered how it would affect my professional career, &amp; am quite satisfied that even though I don't go I will be absolutely unable to pass a single exam while the war is on, &amp; when it is over I would probably look on <strike>mysef</strike> myself, &amp; be looked on by my former friends with such contempt, that it would be useless my going on with my course.  The effect it had on me before the December exams was not one fraction of what it is now.  I've been doing good hours, I've written synopsis after synopsis, but the only thing my head will retain is the names of my friends who have gone or are going to the front.  I don't wish to appear selfish &amp; I hope mother won't think I'm ungrateful.  If the appeals for men in Melbourne are anything like they are here I'm sure she will not.  I think this is the first time I've ever mentioned the subject &amp; am only asking for advice.</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Arthur</p>
<p>P.S.  Keith reached home quite well on Monday.</p>
