<p>Friday Apr. 12<br/>Col. Knox went away this morning. Col. Mansbridge appeared in the Blue Tabs of the Commandant, for the first time. He sent the Band in to Warminster station to play "Knoxy" off.</p>
<p>Beautiful spring day.</p>
<p>The Tables in the Dining Room were re-arranged today.</p>
<p>War news not too good.</p>
<p>Fritz has pushed us back to Messines and we have evacuated Armentieres. Estaires is also gone. We were billeted in Estaires for quite a long time, and had some very happy times at "Caf&eacute; Carlos", Frank Newton and "Payney" and a few others.</p>
<p>No bloomin' mail in yet.</p>
<p>Went to Picture Show in Sutton Very. Not much "chop".</p>
<p>Sat Apr. 13th<br/>[Drawing of maid]<br/>Nothing much doing. Had a clean change and Bath, and did my washing.</p>
<p>No mail in yet. I can't understand not getting any Letters as other chaps in the camp have had Letters dated Feb. 20th and my last was Dec. 30th. I'll be mighty glad to get a Letter from B.E., as her Letters are always so cheerful and give a man a bit more interest in Life.</p>
<p>Flanagan went away on Leave yesterday.</p>
