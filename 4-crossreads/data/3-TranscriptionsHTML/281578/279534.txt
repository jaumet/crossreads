<p>nasty fire on us for a while in the evening, one shell lobbed just behind my dugout, &amp; as it only has a sheet of galvanised iron on top, another 5 yards &amp; it would have "been good night nurse". He spread them about too, but nobody was hit. Went out digging as usual, had to deepen a trench, &amp; as we finished &amp; had our work passed, we were allowed to come home in groups of 10 without waiting for the whole company, &amp; my mate &amp; I were back before 1 a.m. Tuesday 11 June Had a sleep till the tea &amp; bacon came up at 3 a.m., &amp; then slept till dinner time. In the afternoon I did a lot of writing, sent the postcards I salvaged to Min, Mone, Elsie, Will &amp; Dorothy, &amp; wrote letters to Bon &amp; Kathleen Tofft. We didn't go out digging tonight. Wedn. 12 June  Breakfast 6 a.m. &amp; we set off with the old pick &amp; shovel once more down the road through a village with everything smashed by shells as usual, &amp; came to our job. We had to dig a trench 6 feet deep to lay a cable in. It was a filthy job, first of all, insects were sucking blood from our arms, &amp; getting in one's eyes &amp; ears, &amp; about 4 or 5 feet down the ground held water &amp; was muck</p>
