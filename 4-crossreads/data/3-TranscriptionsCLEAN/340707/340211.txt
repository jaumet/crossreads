  
 81 We hit the trail for Montmatre & commence a series of wild drivings with a madman at the wheel who can not drive under 30 miles an hour & so never can turn at proper turnings & is so far past when he can pull up that we have no idea of proper turn. 
 We go from Boulevard to [Fortifications] & finally pick up two girls & spend night in Senga - a dancing cabaret & finally dropping girls one an Algerian & the other a Belge but both speaking Russian fluently at their homes promising to meet them at Taverne de Paris Aven. Clichy. 
 Such was history of my birthday. Rather a rapid one
