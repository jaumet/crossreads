 My dear Judge 
 I am fit &amp; well &amp; having quite a good time here at present. I am again acting Second in Command &amp; as such have been left out of the front line. I am well in rear in a good comfortable hut looking after the details of men who do not go into the line. There is a good deal of organisation work to be done but most of it can be done at a table &amp; a good deal of it before I get up in the morning. The cold has not been nearly so severe just lately &amp; the ground thaws every day. 
 Fritz is having a very uncomfortable time down here lately. How we all wish he would turn it in &amp; let us go home. I have been very lucky missing two turns in the line &amp; have seen practically no shelling. A few stray ones come over here occasionally but never seem to hit anything. 
 Sydney seems to have been turned upside
