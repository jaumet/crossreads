distant presence of "Subs" during the passage, but we sighted nothing.A large number of big ships are riding at anchor, and evidently will be part of the convoy of which we are to form a unit. We have no definite sailing time at present, but as an immense quantity of mails have been put on board we expect to be off tomorrow. It amused us greatly to observe the extraordinary patterns and colors painted on the ships hulls to deceive ''Subs''. This weird "camouflaging" gave them the appearance of floating circus craft. It is intended to deceive enemy gunners by creating a false impression as to a vessels size and speed. Personal observation makes one doubt its efficacy, especially if the sun is behind the vessel. One of my cabin companions is a Padre from the Western front, and I have found him an interesting and agreeable companion.
