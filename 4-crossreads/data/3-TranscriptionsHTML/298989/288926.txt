<p>29/12/15<br/>Another fine day. Letters from home and all my usual correspondents. Parcel from Mutual Store sent by the Melbourne office staff. Struck tents for airing purposes at 0900 on a "G" from the buglers and then marched out to parade. N.C.Os class practisng word of command. Place of assembly near a little rough stone cottage and sheep fold. A circular threshing floor about 30 feet across constructed of irregular  stones set on a level.</p>
<p>Not so much shipping in the harbour to our immediate front today. Another small snug harbour just over hill from here crowded with small craft, great hammering and pier building. After lunch we kept up half holiday. A good many of the men setting out for Kastro and Thermos, at the latter place warm baths are to be had at natural shrines. The Brigade Advance party leaves tomorrow for Egypt.</p>
<p>I spent most of the afternoon reading on the rise overlooking the sea. The beach was quite animated, so many men washing themselves and sitting quietly in the sun tracking down creepies. Amused at the scraps of conversation that came floating up &ndash; some of the lads can swear alright. Read Times till 1600 and then returned to camp. Some of the lads found great variety of things in their billies some few discovered f. l's put in by fair hands. The whole camp is overdosed with parcels, food sweets &amp;c and nobody wants them much &ndash; in the trenches we'd have given anything for them. Drummond isolated in hospital.
