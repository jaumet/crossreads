 Platform . The Porter where shout out , " Right Along Pleas " and " stand back" . When a Train came in , a Porter would stand at the Entranc 's and direct the crowd . The Peopl come off first would pass in one direct and then a rush to get on , onli one at a time through the Barrier and when the Train was full , the Gate on the Train would close , a ring of the Bell , and off she went , and the remaind of the crowd would have to wait until the next , be ad to by other . This rush take place everi day , earli morn , Tea Time and after the Show , It took me over an hour to reach Holborn wherea I could have walk the distanc in 20" . After a Wash and Brush Up , I had some Tea and then read the Paper until 7.30 when I went out across the road to the Holborn Theatr to see the second even perform of a Varieti Show . I join the usual Queue and at 8-15 the first hous came out and we went in . It did not take long
