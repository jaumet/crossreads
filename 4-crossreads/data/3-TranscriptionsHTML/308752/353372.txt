<p>I was even too tired to read them. Of course our underclothes are one mass of chats.<br/>27th October, Friday.  A new idea to day, we will work 48 hours stretcher bearing &amp; have 24 hours off, rather to long for me. Fortunately our party did not proceed far, but stopped at the first post for 24 hours, plenty of work, we were nearly frozen during the night. The next 24 hours we worked at another R.A.P. which was about half a mile from our front line. I was the runner for the night, that is when a patient is brought to the R.A.P.
