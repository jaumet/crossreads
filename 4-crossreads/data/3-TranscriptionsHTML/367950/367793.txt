<p>2nd <strike>February</strike>  MARCH 1917 14th A. G. Hospital<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ABBASSIA CAIRO</p>
<p>From previous references in the journal it will be observed that I have or had been having a deal of sickness. I tried to fight against it but the climax came on the 20th January when I was sent away from the Regiment what my complaint was at first I was at a loss to know but it transpired that I was suffering from Neurasthenia and Debility. The neurasthenia predominating I was sent back to the 3rd Field Ambulance one of our advanced hospitals and after being examined by the Medical Officer (Major Cave) I was sent back along the line to the 24th Australian Stationary Hospital at Mahamadya . After staying there 2 days I was sent to the 24th Casualty Clearing Station at Kantara and after 2 doctors there I was sent to the 14th Australian General Hospital at Abbassia near Cairo where I have been ever since.</p>
