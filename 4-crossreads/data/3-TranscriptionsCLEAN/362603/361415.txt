Red Cross letterheadBulford15.4.17Dear Mum,Your letters of the 28.1.17, 4.2.17 11.2.17 & 18.2.17 all to hand & I am just going to try & answer them all.  I can never find enough news in a week to write, so it is generally 10 days interval between my letters.  On Easter Saturday D. E. & I walked to Amesbury to the Pictures & saw a Film for "Australias Honour."  It shewed views of the Harbour & the old Domain & Trams.  It was a great reminder to us but we are pretty hard hearted now, have to be.On Easter Sunday we started the Daylight saving stunt.  It is now quite light at 8 pm.  I often go out for a walk after 7 pm
