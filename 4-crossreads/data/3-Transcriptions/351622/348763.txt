<p>9 January 1916 Sun<br/>Disembarked at 9 a.m. &amp; boarded train for an unknown destination finally arriving after eight hours travelling at Tel-el-Kebir. I might say that we travelled in animal trucks during this long journey. All the boys happy &amp; singing. Scotty gets on his bag-pipes.</p>
<p>10 January 1916 Mon<br/>A most glorious day &amp; we received our big Xmas mail. I received 15 letters. Had no parade before dinner. Broke camp &amp; hunted Vere up. What a meeting it was &amp; how glad I was to see him. Sorry we could not commemorate the meeting with a glass of the best. Getting camp in order in afternoon.</p>
