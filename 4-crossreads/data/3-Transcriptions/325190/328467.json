<p>Friday 2 Nov 17<br/>Still under canvas at Caestre, nothing more to report about our movements.<br/>Chance of pay today.<br/>Yesterday afternoon Gray &amp; I went for a ramble to Mont de Cats, &amp; reached the foot of the mound on which the convent stands.<br/>Met two Tommies who were very pessimistic about our chances of winning.<br/>It strikes me that not only are the [indecipherable] here pessimistic but  a great number of soldiers are too.  The advance of the Germans against Russia &amp; Italy seems to be the cause of that.</p>
