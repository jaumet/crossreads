  
 a lot of correspondence & house work to do.  We have had a spell of wet & windy weather lately but it has been nice since about 10 a.m. & it is a lovely evening.  I should like to go for a walk but I must try to write some letters first. 
 Well, Dad, I am writing to Mum so I'll have to give Her some news.  Kind Regards to Otto & Chris & those whom you meet who are interested also to Mr. A.H. & E.L.J. if they are not too much above it. 
 Fond Love Harry.
