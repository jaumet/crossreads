My Dear Ones,
   Please forgive me, I'm very much afraid that a mail has passed without a line from me, but my excuse must be that I have been so hard at it that have had no time and if I may confess, not the inclination, for the field manoeuvres lately have been of the hardest, lectures have been constant and in my spare (save the mark) time I've acted as secretary to the Battalion Sports Committee, that meant midnight for about nine nights and two Saturday afternoons lost, but the Sports are fixed now I'm happy to say, and that leaves me time to write.
   Another job I've caught is Company Intelligence Officer, most instructive and interesting but just a bit extra work.  However I'm getting into splendid trim, feeling very fit and happy and doing good work, my lads are doing well and at the same time doing me credit and I hear that I'm recommended for my second star, no difference in position or pay, but it gives a fellow seniority and it will be nice to be really a Lieutenant, not a 2nd Lieut. which feels quite a junior rank.
   I'm greatly enjoying my letters, I passed them on to Fairweather and he thinks/they are jolly good.  Unless my homeletters are personal I post them on to Les, he gets them and enjoys them.  I've posted you a p.c. photo of 37 of the lads, they had it all fixed after a church parade
