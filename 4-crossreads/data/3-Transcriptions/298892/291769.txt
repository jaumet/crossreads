<p>somewhere,<br/>7th October 1917</p>
<p>My dear Parents/.<br/>After what we have been through within the last days; the sights we have seen, and the <br/>advance we have assisted in, I consider that there is every prospect of the war being brought to a successful termination by Xmas. One wants to be at the front to properly appreciate the wonderful organisation and system which has been brought to bear in order to ensure our success. In the most recent advance, the Boshe had five Divisions ready to attack in an attempt to recapture some of his lost ground, and it was arranged for an hour later than our own. Our barrage nipped it in the bud and when the Australians advanced they took thousands of these men prisoners. Our Division alone took 3000 men and 20 officers in an advance of a mile.</p>
