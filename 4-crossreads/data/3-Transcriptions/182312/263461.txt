<p>in the munition factories and in a thousand and one callings which she</p>
<p>is temporarily filling whilst husband or father, sweetheart or brother</p>
<p>is at front.&nbsp; Field work in a climate like that of England is by no</p>
<p>means arduous and should prove a congenial occupation.&nbsp; When the rush</p>
<p>sets in at harvest time, the tens of thousands of soldiers always in</p>
<p>training in Britain might well be employed to take the crops in.&nbsp; We</p>
<p>can never hope to become independent of overseas countries with regard</p>
<p>to our food supplies, but we can do a lot to lessen the necessity for</p>
<p>importation and the more we can do the more innocuous will the enemies</p>
<p>blockade become.&nbsp; Germany must be very short of certain foods but she</p>
<p>won&#39;t starve any more than we will.&nbsp; At the same time we have it in</p>
<p>our power to make things very uncomfortable for her by tightening up</p>
<p>our blockade and I think we can leave the present Government to see that this done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Altogether 1917 promises to be the most eventful year of</p>
<p>the war for it will show every participating power on its mettle.&nbsp; Each</p>
<p>power is now feeling the strain and will wage next year&#39;s war on a</p>
<p>highly scientific style both in the field and organization,</p>
<p>scientifically controlled, will prevail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bungle in Roumania will lengthen the duration of the</p>
<p>war but I shall be surprised if what is left of the A.I.F. isn&#39;t back</p>
<p>in Australia by the end of 1918 - and with a look of satisfaction on</p>
<p>its face!</p>
