There has been some great air fights today I saw 3 Huns 1 of ours come down, one fight took place within a few hundred feet of us, they manouvered, ducked banked, sideslipped, till they were both quite close to the ground, then all of a sudden our plane by a clever swoop a pretty turn got over above the Fritz started to pour his gun in to him we could all see the bright red tracer bullets striking the plane as the S.P.A.D. followed him driving him to the ground, when he had him finished he left him flew away up in the air again to join his mates the Hun came down about a mile away. We got news today of the great victory the French have just had over the Huns on the Aisne, beats me how they get so many prisoners guns each time they make a move, but of course they have wonderful shrewd generals they fight well do the French, they are easily our best Allies.
