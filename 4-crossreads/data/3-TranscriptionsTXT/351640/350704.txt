 Mena House The Pyramids Egypt 5 April 1915 
 My dear Girls:/ 
 Were you in Egypt at this moment you would see me, seated at a table in my room, pen in hand allowing a stream of ink to reach white paper, coloured handkerchief on head and sides of face protecting from the lazy flies as much as possible of my  head and  uncovered parts, a French door in front of me closed  as  firmly,  as 'tis possble,  and without an atmosphere grey and opaque with sand particles, as if moisture in the form of a fog obstructed the view, while a strong wind blowing the the surface of the dessert before it makes the leaves of the gum trees whistle with a rushing roaring sound, the doors to bang, and all not firmly fastened light bodies to part from the moorings.  Midst the dust the outlines of the great pyramids stand out as ghosts of their might towering high up from earth to heaven.  It is the Khamsin, a local name for a dust storm which is common in this land and during the months of April and March each year.  The word being the Arabic for fifty, and applied to the unpleasant conditions which are supposed to occur at intervals during fifty days of March and April.  Until I make enquiries from some one who has lived here for an extended period, I shall not be informed as to whether this is a real Khamsin, two earlier dust storms, bad enough many of us thought, were said by old inhabitants to be nothing to bother about, and that visitors had to wait till the real thing came along, if wishing to know what it is like.  You will be advised later.  One in brief span could take within the limits of his body the whole peck of dust which is said to limit the duration of an individuals life. 
 On Saturday I posted letters to You &amp; Mollie, this morning I placed a supplementary one for 219 Macquarie St.
