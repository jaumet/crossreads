 "Fritz" sending some shells around the hillside tonight but we must be at least 6 miles from the line. Received parcel from home but no letters. 
 Fri. Oct. 27th: - Raining again &amp; the wind is bitterly cold. Don't know what they intend doing with us here. "Fritz" putting a few shells over on the camp again without much damage done. 
 Sun. 29th.  Oct: - Left our rain sodden "humpies" on the hillside near Mametz wood &amp; marched in rain &amp; mud to old tumbling down dugouts on the roadside behind Deville Wood &amp;  at the side of the remains of Longueval. The destroyed Sugar refinery is about 800 yds. to our rear &amp; is just one tangled heap of ruined boilers &amp; machinery. Scrap-iron by the ton. Watelow Farm once existed somewhere in this vicinity. To the right lies Ginchy. Artillery is just packed in a row along the road &amp; keeping up an incessant bombardment on Bapaume which is just to be identified by a clump of trees on the ridge on the distant front. We are in reserves here &amp; the mud is the limit. Our "stunt" is postponed &amp;
