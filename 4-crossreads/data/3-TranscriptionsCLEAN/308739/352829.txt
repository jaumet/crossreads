Sunday 10 December 1916Left Kantara with Goods on 8-45 a.m. Train arriving in Camp at 6-30 p.m.  8 pack Horses to meet me at Station.The line is almost blocked with traffic, & there is every indication that a forward move is expected.  The System works wonderfully on this Line, & much credit is due to the Royal Engineers who have supreme control.
Monday 11 December 1916Left again for Port Said to secure Goods for Officers Mess, also try to see Ewart who is now at Mouski Camp.  Failed to see Brother so went on to Pt. Said by 10-30 p.m. Train.  Stayed at De La-Post-Hotel.  The bed was clean but room poorly furnished.
Tuesday 12 December 1916Went to Hardys this morning & arranged for Goods to be sent to Kantara by 1-40 p.m. Train.  Watson Bey, Super. of Traffic stopped train for our benefit.Left Port Said by midday train & stayed night with at Transport Depot.The Lads here are having a Good time, Drunk almost every night & nothing to do.  Scottie Ross is fast going from Bad to Worse & it looks like a number are following Him.
Wednesday 13 December 1916I left Detail Camp, Kantara, with Goods for Bir el Abd arriving at 1 p.m., 8 Camels to meet me & conveyed Goods to Bayud 9 miles.Received Xmas Parcel from Home.Wireless through that peace was declared.I fear this is a rumour.Later  The Enemy are sueing for Peace.
