<p>HQ which is nearer the centre of the city. I met Douglas from Tasmania again last night. He is staying here for his sick leave and I have been advising him to visit Luxor. There is no talk yet of any of us getting home; but I expect we will go with a rush when we do start. You will know more about it in Australia than we do &nbsp;though I suppose. I&#39;m glad to hear Taffy is looking so well, she will want to be in pretty good condition for me to ride when I get back, as I only weigh thirteen stone now! I hope you are not having too dry a summer. Love to Mother, &amp; the boys.</p>
