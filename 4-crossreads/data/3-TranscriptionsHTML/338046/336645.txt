<p>1917<br/>Dec<br/>of them had almost broken their heads on it. I managed fairly well but didn't overdo it, as I had a long way to fall.<br/>All our clothing was in bad condition but Mick Ogle's pants were the limit. He paraded twice to the QM but was turned down, the QM having no stock. At last Capt Thompson, seeing him asked him what the hell he meant, by going around like that. When Mick unfolded his tale, the Captain said "Tear your pants a bit more and take a walk around the town. If you see General Tivey or any of the staff officers, make a point of walking past and saluting them." he had not been out for more than a quarter of an hour when a staff officer bore down on him and took his name and particulars. Next day a special parade was held. We were about turned and our trousers examined. All ragged behinds were marched off for a new pair right away, myself amongst them. there was a fall of snow every few days and after every fall it used to freeze. This made the roads very slippery.</p>
