Brian Mac who looks well & is doing OK work.  I still knock round the country lots (mostly bike these days) & see my numerous friends & acquaintances.  They hail from all over Australia so I'll have to behave myself when I get back.
My dear here's a nice large shell coming, no its a 'dud', thank heaven, not that I'm in any danger but it might have killed someone if it hadn't been.
Have also witnessed a thrilling air episode & yet its a quiet day.
Had a thunderstorm last night, my tent leaked so I had to arise & don a water proof & cover the bed with another & sit & smoke till the storm passed away.  Today I have had a large wash, all my spare clothes & they needed it.  I'd like to wash blankets but its such a job & water scarce & hard to get & a long way to carry it.
