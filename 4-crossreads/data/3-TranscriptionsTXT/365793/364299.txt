July 18 about 3 hrs sleep, & then we were roared on this m'ng for not turning out at 6 oclock. Left for London at 2.20 & arrived at Wimbledon about 7 pm. Managed to find Uncles place after sundry inquiries, Phyl met me at the door.
19 Went to the City with Uncle (who took a day off) & saw St Pauls, Houses of pl't, Westminster Abbey etc. & in fact had a good tour round.There is the quietude of the old world cloisters where ones footsteps echo & reecho along the dim, arched -[in margin] Wimbledon Park
