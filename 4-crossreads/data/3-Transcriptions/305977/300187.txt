<p>a concert at night.  It was especially good.  The Resident of Ma-adi gave it &amp; they had the best talent they could get in Egypt.  Farrier Sergeant Major Knowles of the Westminster Dragoons was especially good.</p>
<p>Saturday 13th  [Mar]</p>
<p>Was mess orderly with Isted.  Didn't have to shun [attenshun] in the morning.  Got time to write a few letters in the morning.  Several of the troop got leave.  Was detailed for picket tonight, so couldn't get any leave myself.</p>
<p>Sunday 14th<br/>Revielle at 6.15am.  Went to church parade in the cinema tent.  There were several residents of Maadi at this service.  Our troop are in-lying picket tonight but I managed to get leave &amp; went with Long to the Citadel &amp; had a good look around.  The Mosque built by Mahomet Ali is a wonderful piece of work.</p>
