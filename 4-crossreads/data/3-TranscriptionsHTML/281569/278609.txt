<p>January 11, 1916 Tuesday</p>
<p>The remounts we brought in yesterday behaved very well during the night. At 9.30 the Brigadier inspected the Brigade &amp; saw that everything was OK for the move this week which had been postponed to Friday. I went into the Savoy with a urgent to Gen Faire re remounts but could get no satisfaction, came out in a hurry &amp; went to the review which was nothing like the ones of old. Mick M has got 6 months furlough to Australia &amp; Steel 12 months in the afternoon I rode one of the remounts he gave me a rough passage what with aeroplanes &amp; eagles, it was none to pleasant for either the horse or I. Stiny, Hal &amp; I went down the town after tea called in at the Studio got our photos, had a feed as per usual &amp; a bath which was highly appreciable. The C.O. rode the Doug into town in the afternoon &amp; succeeded in getting our money much to our gratification, Pay in the morning. Bed 10.30</p>

<p>Nothing of much importance through the day the mounted men had a full marching order parade, I went into Cairo early &amp; did my usual round of visits getting back in time for dinner in the afternoon Charlie &amp; I went for a spin out El Marq way we warmed the bikes up on several occasions &amp; they stood up to it good-oh although perhaps a little too much valve rattle, Hal &amp; I went down the street after tea &amp; called in at the Russian studio, collected photos &amp; said goodbye to Roalic  who has promised to write he also promised to send ouy photos of he &amp; his friend had another bath &amp; got home about 10 tired and ready for bed. Our horses were realloted today &amp; I now have a big upstanding bay mare 16&frac12; hds high the largest &amp; fastest horse in the troop I've named her Lev in remembrance of its late owner.</p>
