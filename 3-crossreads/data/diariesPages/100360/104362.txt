Wed. Ap. 18th Our Concert came off at 7 p.m. The Mess Hut was packed about 600 or 700 there. The lady on the Farm lent Payney some clothes to wear in the Sketch; & she & her little girl Susan came to the Show. They laughed very much & enjoyed themselves, although they wouldnâ€™t understand a word we said. The Anzac Concert Party were there & said it was a very good show.
