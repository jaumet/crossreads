They use about 4000 different colours.  I saw one that had been started before the war.  It was nearly finished.  They also make patches for old torn tapestries.  I got a bit of wool as a souvenir.  (Finish letter)<br/>We then went to the Conciergerie seeing the oldest clock in Paris en route.  Marie Antoinette was imprisoned there, also the Scarlet Pimpernel.  The whole place brought up memories of Baroness  Orczys books.  After tea we went up to Clichy to see a review at the Casino de Paris.  We were very clever at the door.  There was rather a crush at the ticket office &amp; while we were waiting a man came up to us &amp; said "Do you desire tickets"  I said "yes"  He sold us</p>
