<p>married about two weeks ago &amp; was told about 3 weeks afterwards that she had to go back to Australia &amp; to leave the service.  So the couples will have to waite until after the war is over.</p>
<p>It is quite right, because we really belong to our country now.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose everyone makes great mistakes at some time in life.  I've made many, I know to my sorrow.  I do hope you are all well &amp; not having too hot a summer.</p>
<p>If I get a chance I shall send home my brown costume &amp; a few clothes that I cannot wear but that some of you may be able to make good use of.  I must try to find out the best way to send them.</p>
<p>Give my love to all my friends &amp; tell them to write to me some times.</p>
<p>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all &amp; trust that you are not feeling the hardships of war too much.</p>
<p>From,<br/>Your loving sister,<br/>Edith.</p>
