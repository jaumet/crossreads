<p>to mention in this my new address as should you again have time to drop me a line, E. Lucas will tell you it.  You know perhaps that he's to be found at my old office which I'm afraid I'll never be able to settle down to again altho' I'd be very glad to have the opportunity of trying to at present.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>J.W.S. Lucas</p>
<p>I have not forgotten that my profession is law but I've been on many Court Martials and often wonder if I ever knew anything about Law or if &ndash; the latter "if" being the most likely.</p>
