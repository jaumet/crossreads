Lemnos22/12/15for inspection by G.O.C.  In the evening went over to see Col Crouch at his camp near a big tower found him well and happy housed in a stone place.
The men all happy in their tents and singing. The first time for months they have dared to exercise their lungs in song!
"At the halt on the left form platoonAt the halt on the left form platoonIf the odd numbers don't mark time two pacesHow the hell can the boys form platoon?"
Tune:- "Red White & Blue"
Old Brown's cow went &c. Tune:- John Brown
"I want to go home! I want to go homeTune:- Hymn On! Steadily on!
All beards shaved off today and hair cut generally smartening up. Great night of song in the lines.
