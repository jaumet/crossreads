garrison the Corps Line with their right resting on H11. The whole battalion was in position by 12.30 ready to have charged. The only serious defect was that the men's waterbottles were not full and some of them would have gone forward thirsty. A serious defect this. The newer men were without rations in some cases but the old heads had dived in and collared a double load! Experience teaches. Some of the officers were slow in turning out and had some nasty remarks from me. The cool morning air would cool a few fevered brows. The Q.M. did not rise to the occasion and reposed in a circle of stout bottles. All the men considered it as a serious stunt and all their guns were mounted. Some 23rd were billeted in the trench there and came creeping out half asleep asking our chaps "for the oil". It was a very silent night on the front. About 1.30 under orders they returned to camp again and then turned into bed and another spell of sleep.
