 1917 MAY 
 24 THURSDAY 
 Fine. I went up to the battery 
 with a working party all day 
 &amp; was moving amunition 
 all day. Old Fritz sent a few 
 over &amp; we sent about ten 
 times the number back. I 
 walked home in evening. 
 I heard the big stunt was 
 starting a week from today 
 &amp; is to be the biggest of the war 
 &amp; there is to be 9000 guns under 
 the one G.O.C. The Tommies are 
 going over first then 4 th &nbsp;Div 
 then 3 rd &nbsp;Div. That is the 
 roumer &amp; lets see how true 
 it comes out.
