onI glancinge fearfully skyward I note with joy the I see him making straight at us at a low altitude.  I begin I look around for cover but as he gets nearer I note with joy the two rings.  He pauses hovers right over us & then suddenly swoops ahead & as he dives I hear the rat a tat tat tat of his machine gun.  As he disappears over the brow of the hill another takes his place & repeats the performance.  Evidently Jacko is getting [slops ?] somewhere ahead.  We fail to raise the Divn so mount & proceed ahead.  We run into Hquarters on the brow of the next stony hill, a part of one of the Regts are with them. & the remainder are surrounding about 2000 of the enemy in the hollow beneath.  They have good cover & will not surrender & these are what the aero planes are xxxx machine gunning.
