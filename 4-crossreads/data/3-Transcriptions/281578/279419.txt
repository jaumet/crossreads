There were crowds of Australians lined up in fours, &amp; only two small mess tents, they waited patiently for a long time, then pushed in with a crush, most got a drink of tea but very few anything to eat. Luckily I put some things out of Elsie&#39;s parcel last week in my haversack, &amp; I had a tin of salmon for breakfast. We fell in early &amp; marched through the streets of Dover to the wharf. There were a crowd of Pommies there waiting to go across to France. We got on a boat called the King Edward, &amp; 4 of them choc-a-bloc with soldiers, went out through the nets accompanied by destroyers. It was a lovely day &amp; it was no time before we saw the coast of France &amp;</p>
