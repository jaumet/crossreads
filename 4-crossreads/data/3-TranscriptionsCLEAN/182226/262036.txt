 Got some more letters today, I am in luck. 
 The dainties out of the parcels are going fast & are highly appreciated. 
 We do our work on the desert wich is much harder that that round Cairo & all covered with stones. 
 The country here is very flat looking away towards the canal & all hummocky towards the desert. We get it cold here in the morning but it is lovely & warm later on.
