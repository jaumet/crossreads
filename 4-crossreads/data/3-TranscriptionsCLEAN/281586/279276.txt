Said a lad to me "When I came away to the War, my Mother gave me this" showing me an old, warn, Bible.  "And, he continued, with a light laugh, "She believes that I still read it, and that I still pray"  He was then "going the pace"
1Your last fond gift to meAh, then you little knew(As in your hand you heldThe volume old, and gave it to me then, with many prayers That I'd be true)Nor dreamed, such faith was thineThat scarcely would the leavesBe turned, by hand of mine.
2Neglected was your gift,For long, aside it layWhile, you, dear heart believedThe inspired page, to be to meA source of joy and strengthA lambent RayOf light from God's own ThroneAnd so you prayed, and thought my prayersWere mingling with your own.
3And so with measured paceThe days rolled swiftly byAnd each with tales of broken vowsTo tell, and deeper peering inTo sins dark waysTill God, on HighSeemed very far awayAnd judgment stirred no fearsAnd love was stark and gray.
