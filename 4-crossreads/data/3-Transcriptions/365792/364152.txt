<p>14 Plenty of reading matter available, &amp; some buksheesh sox etc. Rather warm today, &amp; plenty of flies &amp; sand-flies. OC has rigged up a few small targets for shooting practice. Naval Launch just pulled up, &amp; officer came ashore, don't know what for. Arms &amp; legs getting browner every day Warm &amp; clear &amp; hardly a ripple on the surface of the Lake, while along the waters edge the rushes &amp; shrubs are reflected as if in a mirror. Swarms of young fish can be seen close inshore &amp; occasionally a big one leaps out of the water. Did some shooting at 100, &amp; 50 yards. All rifles carry high on a/c of using mark 6 bullets in Mark 7</p>
