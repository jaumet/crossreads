shovelling & picking all day long, we will have about 4 days of it & I have got some good blisters already but it gives one muscles all over, it's wonderful what a lot of earth a number of men can shift all working together.  I got payed yesterday 30/- the first for about a month so I can assure you we were glad of it.  We are wearing our colors now, put them up today & they look alright.  I don't know whether I have told you but I weigh 11 stone now & hope to put some more on before long.  When we get leave & go to London we will be able to send you Christmas presents, nic-nacs, etc. but it does not pay to buy too much here as things are so expensive.  Ken is still away quarantined but is having a good time of it with nothing to do all day long.  I forget whether I told you last letter but he is a meningitis carrier, that is he has the germs in his throat & can give them to others but does not develop it himself, there were six of them in our Company so it is lucky nobody has caught it since we arrived here.
