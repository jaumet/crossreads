And of a loving land friendFrom recollection ne'er will fadeThey are cherished to the end.
"My Countree, Australia"
Oh homeland the fairestAnd best land to me,What would I only give to beOnce more again with theeAway across the ocean's boundlessWhite tipped rolling foamTo the land of landsAustralia my beloved home
I seem to see in fanceyThe dear old home that I lovein the trees the birds are singingAs the sun shines bright aboveOn the beach the surf is breakingAnd the wavelets dance with glee
