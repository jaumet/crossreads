<p>1915<br/>Oct. 16 Sat.<br/>Went to the Railway Institute at Septieh after tea &ndash; a club for English railway employees &amp; friends - A rather pleasant evening was brought to an abrupt close by half a dozen <u>drunk Australians</u> of the A.I.F. "kicking up a shindy". A chap feels jolly well ashamed  sometimes to think he belongs to the Australian Forces.<br/>Secured a Trooper's spur as a souvenir.</p>
