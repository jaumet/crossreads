 Fairly hot. Not feeling too good yet. Had an easy job on Guard all day. Had a good dip at night. 
 20/5/16  Saturday 
 Rather cool all day &ndash; at night it must have been down to  70  degrees &ndash; it was too big a difference &amp; nearly all the Camps have colds. All our leather equipment was called in &amp;  weather  web gear issued, also our colours, only for our crosses, it is hard to distinguish us from the Infantry &ndash; Had the day to myself. 
 21/5/16  Sunday 
 First Mass at 4.30 am &ndash; second at 5/30 am. I went to second &ndash; Done very little all day. 
 22/5/16  - Monday 
 Quite a respectable day &ndash; only for the flies &amp; dust. Went down to the Clearing Hospital &amp; rigged up some large Tents. Had a grand swim at sunset, a large Boat passed &amp; threw over some Cigars &amp; plug tobacco, needless to say there was a great scramble in the water.
