<p>June 1915<br/>a fortnight.</p>
<p>Wednesday 9th<br/>Went into support at 6.30am.  We had an uncomfortable time as there was a fair wind blowing &amp; the dust from the parapets was continually showering on us.  <strike>After dinner we went into No 2 sap to relieve B Company.</strike>  We went into the trenches at 6.30pm &amp; had a quiet night.</p>
<p>Thursday 10th<br/>Came out at 6.30am.  Went round to B Cos supports &amp; had a yarn with Alf whose Co we are relieving at 12.30pm.  A &amp; C Troops finished the day &amp; night in the trenches &amp; things were very quiet again.  I had a fairly crook night with diarrhoea &amp; vomiting.</p>
<p>Friday 11th<br/>Went &amp; saw the doctor &amp; got a no 9 pill which is pretty severe.  Got 24 hrs light duty, so didn't have to go into the trenches.  Had a good sleep in the afternoon but at night didn't feel quite well.  The Turks in front of us were very quiet.</p>
