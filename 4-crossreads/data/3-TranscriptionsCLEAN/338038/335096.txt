Why dam'me, even Civilized troops could not have done what they have"Wish I could only write you a detailed account of all we have seen but it must wait for a future occasion.I have almost given up any hope of getting any letters from home. Last I heard was from Father dated 22/3/1915, and I suppose I will be away again from here before the Australian mail arrives on Wednesday.I do hope you are all keeping well. Must close now with fondest love to yourselves and Patfrom Your affectate SonTerence
