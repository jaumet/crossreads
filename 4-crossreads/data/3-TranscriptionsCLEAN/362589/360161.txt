  
 grow in the Laboratory & I arranged to have a marconigram sent on after us with a report. In this way we got a message 800 miles out from Capetown reporting the names of 6 "carriers" who were promptly isolated on the poop deck aft. We had 2 other cases which developed later but anyway by the time we reached England the health of the troops was excellent & I think we were jolly lucky to get off so well. I do not think there is anything in this letter needing censoring. With Kindest remembrances to you & Mrs Ferguson & Dorothy & hoping  to  you are all well, I remain Yours sincerely M M [indecipherable] Sinclair
