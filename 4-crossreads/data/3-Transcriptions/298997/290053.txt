<p>the houses seems to lack the neatness &amp; cleanliness of the towns of more northern France, as the people lack their gaiety.  But these people are mainly old, the young men having gone to fight &amp; the young women work for their country; they have lived under the shadow of the war for years &amp; it is no wonder if they are not joyful.</p>
<p>The Battalion is in billets alongside US - model barns etc belonging to one of the big houses.  I have made myself acquainted again &amp; hope soon to be back.  The battalion expects to have a brisk time; but does not know where it is going, and just at present there is nothing to do at all.  We of the Salvage Corp have what is known as "the petrol tin stunt"; we were told off to scour the country for petrol tins intended to contain water for the front line &ndash; another instance of the shortage of material, &amp; the necessity for filling the gaps caused by the stuff that has fallen into the hands of Fritz. Fatigue parties from the Battalion were put on the same work.  The result was a large stack of tins, although we took our time over obtaining them, &amp; explored the country.  The villages &ndash; of which there are many within easy distance &ndash; have all the same features; a church showing prominently, one, or sometimes two, proud houses, a stagnant, slimy pond</p>
