  
 15 Yes, my old goldfield doctor, important and resplendent in uniform and badges of rank of a Colonel. 
 He was rathered surprised and somewhat alarmed when I stood before him with the necessary salute and a "Good morning doctor" (This was the second time we met in the battlefield, so he knew I was about but hardly expected to see me with a fearful looking face) "Halloah Geoff, you wound?__" At that moment a greater than he alighted from another (and shinier) car than his, - the General of Australian forces in France, - and a conversation was nipped in the bud, for the mere Colonel had to salute the General and otherwise fuss round as is necessary to fulfil military obligations. 
 After that I had no chance of seeing the doctor for he vanished as is customary with the great, but not before he had done his duty in seeing that those lesser than he, were conducting the busy little dressing station on proper lines. 
 No doubt this is but one of many places which has to be regimentally visited by the Colonel doctor
