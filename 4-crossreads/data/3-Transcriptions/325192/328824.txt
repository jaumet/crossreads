With the end of this strike whe had peace in our Camp. Owing the Camp hawing granted permission, by the Comandant to run same on decant &amp; proper lines, by ourself we formed a Committee wich duty it whas, to see justice &amp; fair deal for both sides. This Committee consisted out of 1 Representative for each Company &ndash; or Barrack, whose duty it wher to see to everything needet in his company.
