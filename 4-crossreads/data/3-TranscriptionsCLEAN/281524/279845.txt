Rather futile people in this War. Steenvorde a fair sized place with a rather conspicuous church tower which is not solid but ribbed and can be seen through. The main pave Poperinghe road leads into the closely packed houses of the town. There is the usual square and rotunda. Not many shops. Bought a few odds and ends from a pretty miss but her thoughts were miles away and it was an effort for her to concentrate her mind on toothbrushes and collars. Met General Bob Smith in the street and yarned with him for a while. His stature and general appearance are a great asset to him in a military sense. Rode home again by the winding roads. Over everyone just now there seems to be a feeling of lethargy & fed upness - I know
