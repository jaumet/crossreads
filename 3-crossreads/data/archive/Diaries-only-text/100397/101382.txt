we went out about 7 miles along the Campbelltown road, had tea then took up a position to defend the Sydney water supply from an imaginary enemy, and after sitting in a paddock at the side of the road for some time, set out for camp. we reached camp about 9-45?P.M. well satisfied on Thursday we went out trench digging I was put with two mates in one of the communication trenches of a Redoubt. we had very little to do, and plenty to time to do it in, Our next trench digging expedition will be at night, so we expect to have some fun and perhaps a casualty or two, one man came very close to being one. on Thursday a lad using a pick just behind him, drove the pick through his trousers and just grazed his his hip. We are having a wretched day today windy and dusty, and fairly hot. there are a couple of good fires burning not very far out. I dont know when I will be down in town again. not till next week I think, as I did not get a night off this week
must close now with love to all from your Loving son Chas G. Pryce
