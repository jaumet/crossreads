 devoid of ani ornament . The street are wonder well kept , and scrupul clean . As the resid are surround by high wall , they convey the impress of gaol and fortif . From the main thoroughfar , narrow laneway meander amongst the hous , and as they are near alway desert , give the place an uncanni quiet . One seem to walk amidst the dead ; an effect convey and heighten by the quaint funer headdress worn by the women folk . This curious shroud is of black materi , span over the head , by an invis frame support , and drape like a loos flow cape to the knee . It is unauthent assert to have been worn as a protect from the French soldieri , dure their occup of Malta , but I can confid assert that the women of Malta must have been more beauti then , than now .
