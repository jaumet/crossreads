<p>November 1916<br/>9th   Birthday- I am twenty to-day.  We have been on the construction of the light railway line all day, &amp; this afternoon over 200 sets of rails &amp; three trucks were brought up by the ammunition train.  We have witnessed some fine air duels to-day &amp; Fritz has been rather active with his aircraft   One of his planes flew over us &amp; about 3 miles behind the lines but was at great height.  Our antiaircraft were shooting very badly &amp; he got back in safety.  We have been bombarding Fritz very heavy this afternoon but to-night Fritz sent some of his shells over our way &amp; some were very close to our humpys.</p>
