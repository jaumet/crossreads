<p>had a real happy time. We each had a most beautiful box of sweets at our place at the table. Mine I like better than the others. It was a pretty sight. Could not wear my best Mess-dress (not allowed) but had a clean dress (a pretty grey cotton-crepe) with my best cape, best cap &amp;  little <u>silk</u> stockings &amp; shoes &amp; clean apron. Our men thought we looked charming.<br/>You'll say I'm spoilt &amp; shall not want to be home again but oh, I do get <u>Mummie</u> sick at times. No place like <u>Home</u>  Hope you all had a Happy Day &amp; that the New Year will be full of joy  &amp; happiness for you all. <br/>Fondest love.                                                                                                                                                             From                                                                                                                                                                              yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                           Edith</p>
