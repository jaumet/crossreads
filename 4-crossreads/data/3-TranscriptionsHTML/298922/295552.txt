<p>*GHARRY</p>
<p>Leave Party are back from Port Said. The men were very full up of things going down. <strike>Lectured by so many Officers, so many Orders &amp; OUT OF BOUNDS, etc.</strike> but they enjoyed their spell. As one of them said, "the sight of one pretty woman driving in a *"GHARRY" was worth the trip &amp; Lectures after so long in the Desert.</p>
<p>Inoculated again for Para TYPHOID, CHOLERA etc. I forget how many this is. Thanks for Grazier with RALPH ANDERSON &amp; JOCK ELLIS notices, poor chaps but sooner go out in a fight than by Disease. This is a healthy spot facing into BIVY. I can see TRAWLERS sweeping mines off GAZA. I am only 100 yards from the Sea.</p>
