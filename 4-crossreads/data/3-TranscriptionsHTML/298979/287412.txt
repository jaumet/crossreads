<p>agreed to act as requested. On Christmas morning at 8 oclock, 68 out of the 70 answered the roll, &amp; later a telegram was received from the remaining two explaining the impossibility of reaching Camp on account of a steamer having been delayed.</p>
<p>After an inspection of all the troops in Camp, by the Inspector General of EF, when the suggested alterations were explained, the well conducted D Coy of the 4th Batt to which the before mentioned 70 men belonged, on being marched back to their lines, when called upon to halt, preparatory to their dismissal, in spite of Officers orders continued their march through the other end of their lines, straight past all officers &amp; other Companies head quarters out of Liverpool being joined by others till the Column was at least 600 or 700 strong and before 5.30 there were very few men left in the whole of the Camp.</p>
<p>Some two or three weeks after, the definite instructions were officially issued discussions and murmurs arose everywhere. The main contention of the men was that if men, who in Gallipoli had established such fame that their deeds would be recorded with those of the very finest in the history of the glorious annals of the British Army, had been trained under similar conditions as then existed, such conditions would be quite good enough for those at present in Camp. Discontent &amp; dissatisfaction reigned supreme.</p>
<p>Most of the men at Liverpool Camp had agreed when the <u>usual</u> time came to dismiss, that they should then all sit down &amp; passively object to the extension of drill hours.</p>
<p>However they had no occasion to even do this, for just after breakfast a long column of men, like a huge snake, was making its way towards Liverpool from Casula.</p>
