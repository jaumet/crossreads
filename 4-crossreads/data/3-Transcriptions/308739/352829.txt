<p>Sunday 10 December 1916<br/>Left Kantara with Goods on 8-45 a.m. Train arriving in Camp at 6-30 p.m.  8 pack Horses to meet me at Station.<br/>The line is almost blocked with traffic, &amp; there is every indication that a forward move is expected.  The System works wonderfully on this Line, &amp; much credit is due to the Royal Engineers who have supreme control.</p>
