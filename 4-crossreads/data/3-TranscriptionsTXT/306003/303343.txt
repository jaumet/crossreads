12-5-16woke once during the night, the sun was well up when I awoke this morning;  We arrived at Zag-A-Zig about 7.30 & watered & fed the horses in the trucks;  Some Tommies had tea ready for us on the platform & we had breakfast.  About 9 oclock we continued our journey & arrived at our destination (Kantara) about 11.30 & by 1 oclock we had our horses tethered to oak trees growing along a fresh water canal about a mile from the station;
had rather a good trip since leaving Hassan Pasha & very little messing about;  Anti-Air-Craft guns have been mounted in various positions on tops of houses & heaps of sandbags;  English soldiers are here in thousands & to the south east of us we can hear artillery apparently practising; these sound a long way off;  From here a light railway runs out into the desert 27 miles &
