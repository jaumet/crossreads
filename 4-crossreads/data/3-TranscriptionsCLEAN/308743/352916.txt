Stables at 6[indecipherable] came over this morning and asked the boss would he have any objections to the Reg running a small scheme now at all, only plenty of sig must take place we left 9 oclock for a position to the S of camp but were kicked out because the [indecipherable] were having field practice & we were in the [indecipherable] zone the LH [indecipherable] of A & NZ were working in conjunction & they presented a fine sight when advancing in squadron the work went tip top only not enough of it so we expect to put in more again shortly.  Word came through that the mails were blocked at Said as the gunboats were steaming up & down the canal for the Turks have brought the big pieces up & have dropped a shell or two on the ditch.

3 February 1915Wednesday 25 weeks of soldiering
Stables per usualAfter break the Reg carried out their usual training.  The reinforcements arrived under Harold [indecipherable] The time Hal had in Alexandria wasn't up to much nothing to eat.  All events are stopped in the canal & no mail is expected for a week or more.  Turks are massing in force along the canal & a pitched battle is expected there any day.  The Infantry are a poor lot the officers are a rotten crowd all boys.  The New Zealanders commenced field firing today & quite startled the camp.  By their outburst, the news was received from HQ re our applications, but he wont recommend Toby's Bert's & mine have been sent further.  The other two troops are all mounted on Precisions & are going the same way as ours.  Bed at 10.
