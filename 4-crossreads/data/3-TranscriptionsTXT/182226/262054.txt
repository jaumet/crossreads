 Feeling better today. 
 It gets very monotomous in this hole. We have to drill just for appearances sake &amp; we are all heartly sick of it as the tucker is very scarce &amp; extremely rough. 
 Stew &amp; biscuits being about the most apertising dish we have served up to us &amp; when there is not a sign of vegetable in the stew &amp; the biscuits refuse to submit to mastrication till they have been thoroughly soaked you may guess it is no first class hotel out this way.
