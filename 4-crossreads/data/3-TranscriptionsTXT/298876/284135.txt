also 16 Nurses on board, some of them sick. A contingent Cingalese  is being formed here to proceed to the front. Silks & moonstones seem to be the principal purchases by Europeans. Cigars I have smoked I found just alright can be purchased 3/- per 200 - About 20 men short at night.

All Light Horse men sent ashore as picket gather up deserters, all aboard by 4 pm - the Boob is full awaiting their trial - several men admitted Hospital. D.T.'s - cuts & bruises from rows. I had the chance of going ashore with Major Argyle but felt very sick - sort of Dengue hanging to me for the past week & night work doesn't improve it. None of the men apart from Pickel were allowed ashore. Nigs in galore around the Boat all day' diving & selling stuff - coaling etc.A lot of nigs came aboard yesterday
