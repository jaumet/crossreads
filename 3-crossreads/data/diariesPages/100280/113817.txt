28th There was a very heavy bombardment raging all night so I expect there has been a big smash down the line again. Nothing to report today am on "guard" things are very quiet. On of our fast new triplanes brought a Taube down lovely yesterday, the plane came down in our lines a little scouting plane followed her right down to the ground lit alongside the Taube to take the occupants prisoner I suppose to claim the machine.
