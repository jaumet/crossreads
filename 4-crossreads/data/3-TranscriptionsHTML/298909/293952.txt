<p>13/4/16  Thursday</p>
<p>A charming day &ndash; eh &ndash; About 9 pm last night up comes a sand storm with about 10 drops of rain &ndash; I got up twice &amp; drove in pegs &amp; tightened the ropes to keep the tent over us &ndash; Had about 2 hours sleep.</p>
<p>I will not try to describe a desert sand storm &ndash; but the usual willy Willy's &amp; clouds of dust that generally precede an Australian storm are only a hint in proportion &ndash; Blowing all day you can't see more than 50 yards, excepting for necessary fatigue partys, we couldn't do anything &ndash; I got a dozen volunteers &amp; went over &amp; got 13 bags of mail so hope to get some. The rest of the day confined to tents, with flaps all weighted down to try &amp; keep the sand &amp; dust out. My eyes are just raw &amp; do not feel too good from Inoculation. The water is condemned &amp; are on &frac34; of a pint of tea at meal times only. The Boys</p>
