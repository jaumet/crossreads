  
 Gas attack by our men today they alternated smoke and Gas the resulting bombardment was also worth looking at.  Fritz return bombardment was sufficiently lively to make us quit work.  Our planes had a bit of a brush up with the Taubes & forced one of them to land. 
 Friday 25-Aug-16 On our way to work we met some of the 10/17 they had apparently just come up to the front.  Among others there were C. Gosher  Bluey Fell, Skinner, Hammond.  A big attack was launched in the direction of Thiepval & the resulting Bombardment was something to write home about.  We had to take to the trenches & while there I picked up a diary containing entries extending over about six weeks.  I think the owner was killed because there was an unmistakeable smell about the diary.  I intend to write to one of the addresses mentioned in it & send it on if required.  To return Fritz kept shelling our job the rest of the day & as he had 4 Balloons up he could see everything that we done
