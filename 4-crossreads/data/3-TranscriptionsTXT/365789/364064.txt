 from the battle of the Somme.  I am allowed to tell, for the interest of the whole Empire, and of Australians and Canadians in particular, how it was the Canadians that relieved the Australians on the dreadful crest on which during some periods of the fighting the latter had borne the main brunt of the Somme battle. 
 The later weeks had been lighter.  The centre of interest had shifted further east.  Although the fighting for the ridge in rear of Thiepval was very fierce whenever it did occur, it was not so constant as when the Australians first went for and took the summit at Pozieres.  Only northwards along the ridge by Moquet Farm was there anything like a constant hammering.  At the end of the position the hitting was hard and lively enough to satisfy the greediest.  The last blow which the Australians drove home was delivered with a sledge hammer.  It went home full strength.  It broke the Prussian Guard reserve, and it was followed by the inevitable consequence: Forty-eight-hours &ndash; first wild fighting, then heavy digging, lastly interminable bombardment growing crescendo, battering in trenches and barricades and shell craters until the weary-eyed remnant that held them could scarcely stand for fatigue, and men dropped asleep with 8-in. shells tearing down the sky beside them, and ripping the earth in twain with crash and flash in the night.  The only thing that livened them was the appearance of the German guards on the last grey morning, attacking from one corner of the line in the open, and giving them such shooting as soldiers had at Waterloo.  It was like champagne to the fortunate few against whom the attack was aimed. 
 It was before this that the time had come for the supporting troops to be drafted into the fight.  I shall not forget the first I saw of them.  We were at a certain head-quarters not a thousand miles from the enemy's barrage.  Messages had dribbled through from each part of the attacking line telling exactly where each portion of it had got to; or rather telling where each portion believed it had got to &ndash; as far as it could judge by sticking up its collective head from shell craters and broken down trench walls and staring out over the limitless sea of craters and crabholes which surrounded it.  As the only features in the landscape were a ragged tree stump, and what looked like the remains of a broken fish basket over the horizon, all very distant, and a dozen shell-bursts and the bark of an unseen machine-gun all very close, the determination was apt to be a trifle erratic.  Still, the points were marked down where each handful believed and trusted itself to be.  The next business was to fill up certain gaps.  An order was sent to the supports. 
 They were to send an officer to receive instructions.  He came.  He was a man nearing middle age, erect, tough as wire, with lines in his face such as hard fighting and responsibility leaves on the face of every soldier.  The representative of authority upon the spot &ndash; an Australian who had faced ugly scenes &ndash; explained to him quietly where he wished him to take his men, into such and such a corner by such and such a route.  It meant plunging straight into the thick of the Somme battle with all its unknown horrors &ndash; every one there knew that.  But the newcomer said quietly, "Yes, sir," and climbed up and out into the light. 
 It was not an Australian who spoke.  That "Yes, sir," came unmistakably from the other side of the Pacific.  It was the first of the Canadians upon the Somme battlefield. 
 An hour or so later a young Australian officer, coming up with his men to improve an exposed and isolated trench &ndash; a trench which was out-flanked already, and enfiladed, and in half-a-dozen ways unhealthy &ndash; into a condition to be held against any attacks at all costs, found coming across the open towards his exposed flank a line of stalwart men in kilts.  His men were dead tired, the enemy's shell-fire was constant and heavy; grey heads and helmets constantly seen behind a red mud parapet across a hundred yards of red mud craters proved that the guard reserve was getting ready to counter-attack him.  Every
