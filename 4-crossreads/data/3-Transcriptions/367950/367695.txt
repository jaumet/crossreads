<p>The above rough diagram gives a rough idea of how I got the message through eventually. I tried that phone by all methods known to me how to get a contrary phone to work (and I know a few) but it was no go. And time was pressing. That message should have gone through many minutes ago minutes were by the way of vital importance on that, and the succeeding night when the final Evacuation took place. I tried with the voice but there was so much buzzing and talking going on that it was impossible to get a hearing. As a last resource I decided to try and get through by the "M.H" (1st Regiment) line. I tried with the voice but the 1st Regiment operator was in communication with some one away over at the 5th Brigade miles away, and when he had told me in the most gory and lurid language to get off the blanky line and not interrupt I had no choice but to wait, and the man at the other end was the slowest operator I ever heard taking a message (evidently a Novice). There were frequent interruptions and it went something like this "Yes I got that but what was after that"? "M.H" &ndash; " "At the time stated". The other end &ndash; "At the what"? "MH" &ndash; "At the time", - "Time" no TIME" T-I-M-E"! The other end &ndash; "Oh yes of course "time" "Yes"? M.H. (dictating) "Stated" The other end &ndash;</p>
