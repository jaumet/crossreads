hours newcomers falling into the trap and scouts went around hunting up Sgts and all to try & beat this weight lifter, needless to say each new victim provided mirth especially if they could not see the joke & went "sour."Saturday 14th July  On Thursday this Division was visited by the King.  The sports of last week were repeated for his benefit & were more splendidly managed, he remaining 3/4 of an hour during which time he strolled round the ground & shewed himself to everyone.  Special instructions were given to the men to cheer him well but 'twas a feeble lot of cheering except when he was going away.  He appeared to be much as when I saw him in 1914.  I believe the Queen is over with him but as the papers have not yet announced his visit here I do not know for certain, I do know however She came as far as Boulogne.
