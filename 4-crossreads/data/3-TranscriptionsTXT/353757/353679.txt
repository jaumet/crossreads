 [Transcriber&#39;s note: Private Arthur Reginald Hine enlisted in the 3rd Battalion, 1st Infantry Brigade, A.I.F. on 18 August 1914 when he was nearly 25 years of age. He embarked from Australia on &quot;Euripedes&quot; on 18 October 1914. These letters commence when Private Hine was in camp at Randwick, then from Mena Camp in Cairo, from Lemnos Island, from &quot;a trench&quot; and then from England. His Army records show he was wounded in action in France and was sent to a hospital in England in July 1916. The last letters are written from Keble College, Oxford, where he was attending an officer training course, following which he was promoted to Lieutenant. He embarked for Australia on the &quot;Nestor&quot; on 12 December 1918. Arthur Hine also served in World War II at the age of 55. 
 Voltaire Molesworth (1890-1934) was a journalist &amp; parliamentarian. Between 1914 and 1918 he served as secretary of the Nepean Labor Council while working as a journalist. He was elected a member of the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly for the seat of Cumberland in 1920 but retired in 1925.]

 Dear Vol 
 This camp is the limit; hard work no tucker &amp; bad bed. Wish I was in your back room; I did sleep well there. 
 I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll leave but the sooner the better now. Could any of your newspaper friends do with interesting copy? If so I could send to you &amp; we could go halves. But I suppose you&#39;ll be in parliament in a few weeks &amp; that being so will have no further 
 [See following page for next page of this letter.] 
 to your father, mother &amp; sisters &amp; when you go to parliament remember that those at the front want a bit of that paper &amp; the funds &amp;c. for our wives &amp; families (if any). 
 Yours A. Hine
