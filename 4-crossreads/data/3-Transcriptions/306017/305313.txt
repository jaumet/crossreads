<p>February 1916<br/>about a week.  I went into town on the 1st of Febry &amp; met Cousin Will Douglas who is now in Cairo.  We had tea together.  He is a very quiet chap &amp; talks very little.  He arranged to come out next Sunday &amp; see me.  On Saturday afternoon several of us obtained leave.  It rained all the afternoon &amp; part of the night.  I had tea with Harry Newing &amp; afterwards met some Indian doctors from the Citadel.  We spent a very pleasant evening &amp; I caught the 9.30 pm train back to Maadi.</p>
<p>On Sunday 6th Febry I remained in camp &amp; wrote some letters.  Cousin Will did not turn up.  We all received billies a couple of days ago &amp; found them very acceptable.  Mine was sent by Mr A E Turnbull of Savage Club, Melbourne.  I wrote to him acknowledging the gift.</p>
<p>7th Febry  In the morning we prepared for the inspection of the Brigade by General Ryrie. At 1.30 we fell in &amp; marched out about 2</p>
