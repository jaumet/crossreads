 &nbsp;&nbsp; Then through ancient woods, over pleasant hills, along roads running over green expanses like white ribbons, and fringed with apple trees, already bright with the ripened fruit.&nbsp; Then a long run down into the town, a search for a good hotel and that found, dinner, cigarettes a yarn and bed. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning a visit to the sights, the cathedral and other fine churches, then a walk by the riverside where numbers of ocean-going steamers berth 60 miles from the river mouth.&nbsp; Here too, there is a curious travelling bridge or ferry, suspended over the water and hauled on an iron bridge frame from side to side of the river.&nbsp; At lunch we met a friend of Capt.Furze, an English lady who has spent most of her lifee in this locality, she now spends her mornings nursing in a French Military Hospital, her afternoons handing out coffee at an English Y.M.C.A. Club for Soldiers.&nbsp; She gave much interesting information re. the locality. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch we tired of the town and finding our car started to make the journey home, stopping at a riverside cafe fo tea, and reaching home before dark. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The next trip was a Sunday trip to Trouville, a fashionable resort, its &quot;plage&quot; (beach) about half a mile
