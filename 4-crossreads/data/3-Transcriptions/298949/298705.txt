<p>leg &frac34; of an inch long &amp; a scar on right arm &frac12; inch long.  Grunewald has 2 scars on left side of butthooks.  Peugel &amp; Lange came to me about 5 minutes after the wounds had been inflicted &amp; asked me for cotton.  The wounds wher bleeding very freely, so much so that Peugel pulled off one of his boots &amp; poured the blood out.  He almost feinted.  The scare I have mentioned are old scares.  They are not the result of bayonet wounds inflicted in the Liverpool Camp.  I know, that of my own Knowledge, in adition to these I have mentioned a great number of Men claim, to have been bayoneted too.  Twas in the Theatre on Friday afternoon when roughly 20 Men claimed, they had been bayoneted at Torrens Isl.  At Torrens Isl, when Capt Hawkes was their.  I remember an incedent about a Man named Merke who was living outside the compound.  He was known to be mentally insane.  He is now in a Lunatic Asylum.  I saw him first at the point of the bayonet, being told to go down to the beach &amp; gather Mallee roots.  He went quitly.  He dit not turn around or say anything.  He nevertheless recieved several stabs.  I saw that myself.  I remember when Grunewald was stabed.  I saw him getting chased by a soldier towards the small Compound.  When he came to the gate, he recieved a trust with the bayonet.  I dit not complain about that becourse their was no oportunity from the date of the shed incident &amp; the date of the arrival of Mr Hughes.  When Capt Hawkes was absent from the Isl.</p>
