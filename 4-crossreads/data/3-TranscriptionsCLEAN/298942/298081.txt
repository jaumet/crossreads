  
 tonight, had to be taken by way of fields covered by hedges. 
 Shells round the field tracks showed where  relieving  the direct observation worked. 
 All the way up from the post the man I was relieving was explaining how things stood with us. Unfortunately he was quite explicit that our place gets more than its share of shelling every day. On the other hand  we  they have not had much work, so it has its good points. 
 Passed French dressing station & then came to ours
