<p>hospital here I came away before the attack was over. But have since heard our fellows took the ridge they were after. This is the first spell away from the Batt I have had since joining up havent missed a parade up to getting hurt not a bad run was it.<br/>Well Father there is really nothing more to tell you so shall have to close Will write again in a day or so when I know how the hand is going on. Love to all<br/>your sincere son Clyde</p>
