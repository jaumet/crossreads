8 April, 1916 Saturday
Revielle at 5.15
At 11.30 last night we were awakened by a loud burst of fire at first it seemed as if Mt Senussi had called on us but after a while we heard that it was the Tommy's ammunition that was alight, they lost 5 machine guns 65000 rds of 303 amm, some poor beggars will fall in. 
Sports were held today we got a fair share of the prizes; just after lunch a "Hoah" paid us a visit, all day it had been frightfully hot a change came along at 12 oclock in the shape of one of their notorious winds, it came over in a wall of sand 15 miles wide heaps of wind to push it along, the horses felt it very badly also some of the men, we all came out of it like niggers.
Mail today arrived but again there was nothing for me, have given up expecting letters.
Bed 10.
