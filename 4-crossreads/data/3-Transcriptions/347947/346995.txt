<p>kind to us before the last time we were here before we went to Inverness. we stayed at perth this time till the following Monday 3 days and it was very cold especially on the Sunday before we left. early in the morning looking out of the window up top of the Building were we were staying was surprised to see the tops of the houses white with snow which had fallen during the night. but after we had Breakfast and went out found it inches thick in the streets tops of the motor cars white and everything white with it. as it was my first experience in the snow it was very interesting it continued to snow at intervals all day and walking in it make the feet very cold. on the sunday</p>
