  
 November 1916 3rd.   I have been down in the trenches all day on reconoisance work with Lieut Oliver.  We were in the vicinity of the support trenches but were handicapped greatly by the mud.  Fritz's artillery was very severe there, but his rifle fire is a mere detail as the artillery of both sides is doing most.  Our own artillery was pouring the shells into his lines all day long & our aeroplanes dropped numerous bombs.  The mud in the trenches is the worst thing to contend with & it is with difficulty that the men can move about. Things have been fairly quiet on both sides during the day, but I believe we gave Fritz a bad time yesterday.
