many things which made life bearable, had it not been for the Y.M.C.A. On coming out of the trenches, invariably the first place one sees is probably a dug-out or some shanty, where it is possible to obtain refreshment and cigarettes. You are tired, miserable, dirty and wet, and it is a god-send to be able find a place where you are given something warm. This is what I have seen of the Y.M.C.A.
Then we go into the back areas and we find again the Y.M.C.A. in evidence, "running" a canteen, the prices being much lower than it is possible to obtain the stuff elsewhere. 
You come to London on leave, the same thing happens, you find any amount of Y.M.C.A. huts, where you can obtain beds, and good meals, at a cost far, very far below the ordinary restaurants, and boarding houses. It has been stated to me that they have made a profit on their meals, well that does not worry me, I am not quite such as fool as to pay 3/6 for the same article I can get for 1/5. If they made a profit, more power to them. They had voluntary attendants, I am told. Well that's nothing to do with me.
I say and shall always say that the Y.M.C.A. did more for the comfort and welfare of the digger, in France, Belgium, and England, than any other Institution of it's kind, churches thrown in. Good luck to the Y.M.C.A. and Salvation Army.

One early morning as we waited outside the Y.M.C.A. dug-out, a shell fell practically in the midst of the crowd, a yell for stretcher bearers (a few of these always accompanied a fatigue party) - I always "take my hat off" to a stretcher bearer, for such a combination of bravery and gentleness it is hard to find) which was at once responded to, another shell came perilously close, so, many of us decided that we really didn't want any cocoa that night, & "stood not in the order of our going", but "beat it" for all we were worth.
