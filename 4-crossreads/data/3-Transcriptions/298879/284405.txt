<p>July 1915<br/>Tuesday 13<br/><u>Dusty</u> Hot wind<br/>Nothing of notice to record</p>
<p>Wednesday 14<br/>Still very dusty. Went aboard H.M.S. Venerable with some friends after pinching a boat from the wharf. Had tea on board &amp; was given a few articles by one of the sailors. They are all jolly good sports.</p>
