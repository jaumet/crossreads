 Got back to Bn about 2.30 P.M. found the boys just having dinner. They have not been in the trenches since I left. We are living in huts. The food supply is  ne  not the best by a long shot. My appetite has returned too worse luck. The weather is very cold. 
 27th 
 The boys in the trenches must be having a bad time  in the trenches  now. It is bitterly cold on the feet. It is almost impossible to keep them warm night or day. I expect there will be a lot of poor fellows going away with frost bite or trench foot. Our guns do not cease firing. The germans must be living in a perfect hell.
