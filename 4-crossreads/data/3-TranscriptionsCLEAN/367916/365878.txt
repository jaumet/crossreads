 Dear Mother & Father, Tomorrow I am going back to France. In many way I shall be glad to get back the only trouble is that I don't see what  job I am going to get since there have been many changes over there in my absence. Anyway I have had a splendid time over here and have appreciated the rest and change thoroughly. I am now quite fit and well as ever I was and have no effects of gas whatever. 
 Best love, Your affectionate son, C.R. Lucas
