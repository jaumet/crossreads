<p>the birds-eye view &amp; this morning we had the satisfaction of learning there were more dead &amp; wounded Turks in this Valley than in any part of the section.<br/>I suppose it is only once in a life time one would ever have such a commanding position. A few Turks came up the sand wall we had climbed, any part such as this, one goes down to the knees in the drift. A bank of projecting sand kept them out of sight till they were within 20 yards. Suddenly their heads appeared &amp; the men stood up on top &amp; fired. It was a very lucky Turk if any got back they were only 20 yards away buried up to the knees in the drift sand &amp; pumped after the climb.<br/>We found them trying to push in between our flank &amp; A Sqd so got our men forward another hundred yards. We could catch sight here &amp; there of more men coming up &amp; those in advance were trying to "decay" us. However a couple of volleys into the mob soon altered their minds.<br/>The Turks we had been firing at in the valley had already retired &amp; things were looking rosy. However their machine guns on our right got enfiladed fire on the line &amp; their shells started coming. First a heavy curtain of shrapnel on the lead horses away to the rear</p>
