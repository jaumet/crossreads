<p>April 17th. Mon.<br/>Had leave of duty during the afternoon. Went into the city of Rouen. Taking the tram to Bonsecours we climbed up a sheer precipice in spiral fashion till we reached near a big monument in memory of Joan of Arc. There is a nice old church built there also</p>
<p>One got a magnificent view of the surrounding country as we mounted up the steep incline and from the summit of the hill. The view of the River Sienne, the small islands in the river, the number of bridges which cross the Seine at this part, and the magnificent Cathedral looked splendid indeed. The large number of tall Chimneys gave one the impression that this is an industrial city.</p>
<p>Returning from Bonsecours, I visited the market place in the centre of the city. On a marble slab there is a diagram of the city in the time of Joan of Arc. Another slab fixed into the pavement marks the spot where Joan of Arc was burned.</p>
<p>Wandered about the city for an hour or two enjoying the antiquity of the place, narrow streets, ancient buildings and statues make some parts quaint and interesting. I saw the famous old clock of Rouen.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc is the great favourite in this place. Momentoes of her are to be seen in all the shops, most of them are in the form of little statuettes.</p>
<p>Went back to camp, found when I got there that, a number had been indulging in liquor and were singing songs boisterously.</p>
<p>April 18th. Tues.<br/>Went out with .G. and a few others</p>
