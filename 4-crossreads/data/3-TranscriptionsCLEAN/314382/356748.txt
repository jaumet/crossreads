  
 extent to care for themselves; Accordingly a separate mess room containing 18 tables, adjoining these wards, has been provided, and the labour of bringing meals to the beds has therefore been dispensed with here. In these quarters the bunks are arranged in double decker fashion, but in the remaining 12 wards, swinging cots are installed for it would be awkward to have to attend cot cases in a top bed, especially if dressings are needed. 
 Wards B1 and 2 lie on the promenade deck and occupy the space originally held by the 1st and 2nd class Smoke rooms. They are perhaps the most pleasant aboard and therefore the first mentioned is used by commissioned officers only. Another smaller ward on the same deck, containing 12 beds, accommodates any Warrant-officers, but should there not be a dozen aboard the empty beds are used by any of the other patients. 
 The "E" division contains 6 wards, 1, 2 & 3 being used for medical cases, whilst 4, 5 and 6 have as inmates Surgical cases alone. Of these 6, numbers 3 and 5 are the largest, the latter having two divisions to it, and 3 is perhaps the nicest in appearance, it serving originally as the 1st Saloon dining-room. 
 Opening on to the well deck aft is D1 where the most serious cases are treated, it being in some respects more elaborately appointed than the others.
