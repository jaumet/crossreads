<p>At Place Castellane we soon found ourselves in the midst of a big crowd &amp; in about "two ups" everyone had decorated himself with a French flag &amp; flowers in profusion. A battalion of South African Infantry ( wearing the "tommy" uniform with cap) and a squad of Indian Lancers with fluttering pennants were already there, &amp; soon afterwards a couple of thousand kilted infantry, also belonging to the South African Exped Force, arrived. We started off in the following order: Indian Lancers, Australian Brass Band, Australian &amp; New Zealand Details, Aust. Army Medical Corps, Sth. African Infantry, Sth African Scottish. A few dismounted Indians &amp; French interpreters were also scattered through the column. Before leaving Castellane I really thought myself a veritable flower garden but soon after I felt like  6 flower</p>
