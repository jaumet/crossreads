<p>Friday Sept 14th<br/>Dull, cloudy &amp; promising rain We left Metteren at one oclock &amp; marched about 12 miles to our present camp near Onderom &amp; Orkelush in Belgium The country is very nice. Hop fields are plentiful &amp; the women, girls &amp; boys are very busy picking hops The hops grow on big trellises &amp; run up on wires like vines The wire is fastened by a string to a cross wire about 20 ft. up a knife on a long handle is run along the top wire &amp; cuts the string &amp; the wire falls then the pickers pick the hops they get a penny a kilo = 2 lbs about, rather more. There is no skill required in picking &amp; the children do quite as well as the grown folk &amp; make good money about &pound; 1 per week. The place here is very busy, hundreds of Motor Lorries are parked about and a constant stream of lorries &amp; troops is moving along</p>
