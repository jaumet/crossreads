 Wednesday 10 January 1917 [1918] Such bright sunny days &amp; so lovely to be alive. S. Peile is now in charge of Connaught &amp; although brusque in manner will I think be interested in her pts. and be just. Off 5-8 p.m. &amp; went town &amp; got silver watch for which I paid Pt. 30.  N. Cobcroft visited me 8 p.m., the same old Cobbie as of yore only not so bright &ndash; how life changes us all.
