<p>has been sent to Luna Park, but he looks very well &amp;  his wound is healing nicely. He came to see me yesterday after-noon and looked so nice in his new outfit. I shall be going out with him on Tuesday, if all's well.<br/>Sister Martin has been sent on Transport-duty to Australia. She only got one hour's notice to pack. She left by train for Alexandria on Friday morning feeling very grieved &amp; upset. She lives in <strike>Ke</strike> Redan Street, St. Kilda &amp; is on the 'Phone, so you could ring-up  &amp; she may be able to tell you something of me but I have not seen her much as she has been at Luna Park on night-duty since we landed. Ethel may remember her, we met in Chapel Street. Poor girl, she had been very friendly with Captain Tailton  &amp; he had just been to say good-bye to her Thursday-night because he was leaving for the front Friday-morning.  <br/>I am still in Officers Ward but never know any</p>
