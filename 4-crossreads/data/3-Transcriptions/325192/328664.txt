<p>in Adelaide, South Australia, February 1910. Three days after my return, I married my fianc&eacute;e, an Australian born Lady. I wher employet in South Australia untill 1913 when, I wher called owing my proffession to Broken Hill New South Wales Australia. Being in the employ of the Britishe Mine, on the line of lode, found me their, when the War broke out between England and Germany. Owing me being married to an Australian Lady, the father of two Australian born children, also me arriving hier as a youth, made me think, I had lost my European rights, and so classed myself as an Australian citizen. This wher the reason for me failing to be naturalized, however at the time of me writing this, I am not sorry for me failing to draw my Citizen Papers, beccourse previous to receiving those sayd Papers, the Government under Oath promisses the Personall Rights equall to a British born, however I have seen during my internement that the Government looked upon the Naturalization Papers as "Scrap" only, and interned persons if naturalized or not. On January 8th 1915 I wher called upon by a Constable and ordered to the Police Station under arrest. On our arrival I wher informed, to consider myself in custody as a Prisoner of War. The reason for my arrest as stated wher "failing to report". This acusation wher a false one</p>
