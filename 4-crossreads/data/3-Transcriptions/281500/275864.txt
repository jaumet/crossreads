<p>so you can see "trench feet" is far worse than all the German shells &amp; bullets.  We are carrying our overcoat, watersheet &amp; 1 blanket with us, won't we do a perish, somehow or other I am dreading this trip to the line for what reason I don't know.</p>
<p>All men have to wash their legs &amp; feet this afternoon from the thigh down &amp; then rub "whale oil" in, it should be a good thing, we are taking enough precautions, &amp; besides each platoon is carrying 4 small tins of it with them.  The way they are handling our socks lately is most unsatisfactory, we hand good socks in, &amp; get dirty ones in return &amp; sometimes none at all.  I laid a complaint this morning to Mr. Edgely about the matter.</p>
<p>31st. "Fell in" last night at 3 oclock &amp; as per usual stood about</p>
