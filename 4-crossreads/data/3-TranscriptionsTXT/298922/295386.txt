Am posting you a "VIVE PARISIENNE" paper you will perhaps smile at some of the Broad Jokes but this is the paper the SOLDIERS all buy in France &amp; here &amp; is the best French lesson possible.
Did Patrols today &amp; 2 Lectures on Dismounted Attacks such as through the scrub on Gallipoli &ndash; war news better &ndash; my notes will be useful for future reference.
Went to Remount Depot to see Col. McLeish but he was out. Heliopolis is very deserted now. Glorious weather and neck alright.
