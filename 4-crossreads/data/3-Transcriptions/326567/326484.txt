<p>destroyed &amp; came down in Flames, the same thing happened at 5.45 Pm another Machine came out of the clouds &amp; made for another Balloon &amp; the Observers both got clear of the Balloon. Fritz flew just over the top &amp; dropped something on the top but missed it, he then turned &amp; used his Machine Gun on it &amp; soon it was in Flames, giving off volumes of Smoke, the Guns all around him gave him nothing but he took little heed of them, several of our Machines gave chase but he rose into the clouds &amp; soon was lost to view. This is one of the Experiences I enjoy seeing Fritz with the Guns banging at him although Bullets are flying all around us &amp; pieces of shell from the Explosives, nobody up to date has been hit &amp; having our steel Helmets on, we feel a certain amount of Security. After all the fun was over I went for a stroll along to the Aerodrome &amp; saw some interesting sights, I was shown over a Hanger which contained 4 Machines each one having space for two Men.
