14/7/17 BeaulencourtHad arranged to go to Amiens with the Craig brothers but transport failed us. The morning was devoted to specialist training. I went round with the doctor and did the rounds of the camp finding it good on the whole. Between Villers au Flos and the camp our bombers were operating. No one was in sight but the resounding bangs of the explosions were like the real thing. Some of the men were on rapid wiring. After lunch had a sleep and before tea went down and had a long talk with the General about matters of interior economy. Bridges (the new B.M.) has already arrived and is getting into the running. In the evening went over and saw Colonel Brazenor. The troops very cheerful tonight much singing & joy down the lines. Had a good evening with French text books. Our buglers (Muldoon Cummings & Dalton) played an exquisite "last post". The regiment is going well at present.
