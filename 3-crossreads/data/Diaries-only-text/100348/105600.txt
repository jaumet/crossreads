Commenced our "Rest?" with the usual syllabus of infantry training. Our acting O.C. is not popular, so things are not as pleasant as they might be. It is very pleasant here surrounded by woods and a small river running past.

Have been drilling hard all the week. Went on a long route march today. Old "Digby" came back this morning he looks none the worse for his shell shock. We gave him a cheer for we are all pleased to see him back. There a two very nice old French people in this billet, their daughter is very nice too. I am well in with them, and often take "coffee royal" with them. Was issued with a shirt and received a lot of mail this week.
