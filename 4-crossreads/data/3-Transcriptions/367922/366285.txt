<p>June 3rd 1919.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<br/>In this time of gladness when right has been so gloriously vindicated, our hearts are filled with gratitude and esteem for all who have striven and suffered, especially for all who have lost their own lives or the lives of their dear ones in the great cause.</p>
<p>The sons of the University have had a memorable part in the struggles and achievements of the fighting forces of the Empire and the Commonwealth, and of these your son, Dene Barrett Fry, has made the last sacrifice.</p>
<p>It is fitting that I as Chancellor should tell you on behalf of the Senate how that sacrifice is regarded by the University. The whole society remembers its fallen heroes with pride and admiration, and shares sincerely in the grief of their kinsfolk. With no wish to intrude on your sorrow but in obedience to a sacred claim, I offer this tribute of grateful appreciation to the departed and of respectful sympathy to the bereaved.</p>
<p>However great the blank in your home, may it more and more be brightened by the thought that your son's death and your own suffering have not been in vain and could not have been incurred in a nobler cause.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>W.P. Cullen<br/>Chancellor.</p>
<p>A. Fry, Esq.,<br/>Denegully,<br/>Lindfield.</p>
