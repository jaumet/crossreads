<p>Had the afternoon off duty.  Climbed to the top of the Great Pyramid of Ghiza.  It is said to have been built by King Cheops 5000 years ago.  It was originally 477 ft high but the top part has been taken away which makes it at present 451 ft. high.  Built of limestone it is said to cover a base of 13 acres.  I had an old Egyptian guide.  He held me by the hand and pulled me up step by step.</p>
