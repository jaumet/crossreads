<p>close on three years since I saw him last, so you can imagine the long yarn we had. On the way back to the Aid Post I passed some "Anzacs" dressed up in top hats, going up to the Front Line.

Well to-day was well in the running as at 2 a.m. Fritz started his tricks again. He sent a few gas shells over our vicinity. All at our Post, had gas masks on for one hour &amp; 20 minutes.
