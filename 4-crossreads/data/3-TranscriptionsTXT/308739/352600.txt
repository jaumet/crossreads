 [Transcribers' note:  This is the second diary of Henry Frederick Wallace Tucker. At the beginning of January he is in hospital in Cairo.  He is discharged on 5th January and goes to Maadi Camp where he takes up his duties with Colonel Fuller.  During 1916 he moves between Cairo, Suez, Alexandria and to various places in the Sinai Peninsula.  As well as being with Colonel Fuller, his duties also cover stocking the Officers Mess.  He gives descriptions of the day's activities, lists the various Officers visiting the Camp, describes in detail the surrounding countryside near the Camps and gives information on the fighting taking place.  At the end of the diary he gives his observations on a scouting expedition, Gallipoli and what he knows of the life of an Egyptian Muslim.]
