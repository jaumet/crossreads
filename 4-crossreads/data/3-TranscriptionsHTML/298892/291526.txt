<p>A.M.C.<br/>Rutherford Camp<br/>East Maitland.<br/>Thursday  30 March 1916</p>
<p>Dear father &amp; mother/.<br/>I have been kept extremely busy so that I haven't had any opportunity to drop you a line.<br/>Myself and another orderly were transferred to our present quarters about three weeks ago. On our arrival we found that there was an outbreak of Mumps &amp; Measles in the Camp and about forty patients in the Hospital with no one to look after them except a detail of men from the lines. We had to buckle to right there and then and try and create some order in the hospital and have been going like steam engines ever since.<br/>Ten more men have now been sent up from Liverpool but most of them have had no experience whatever having come straight from the infantry and are worse than useless.<br/>Unfortunately another man died on our hands. He had measles and subsequently contracted septic pneumonia.<br/>We now have 104 men in Hospital and as we have very few conveniences and have to carry our own water a distance of about &frac12; a mile you may judge of how busy we are.<br/>I will write you further shortly.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene.</p>
