<p>Saturday, 13 March, 1915<br/>Cleaned saddlery in the morning and in the afternoon I wrote a lot of letters home &amp; sent a lot of curios, that I excavated home to mother.  That was a party out digging again this afternoon and they got a lot of scarabs and found a skull that had been split clean open by a sword.  The experts say that it was killed in battle.</p>
<p>On picquet at night good fine night horses very quiet.</p>
<p>There was a tradgedy tonight whilst returning from the dance that I always go to at Bulac.  A chap was attacked by Dagos and stabbed to death.  Over twenty have been arrested by the shaurshes (native police).</p>
<p>Sunday, 14 March, 1915<br/>C. P [Church Parade] as usual in the morning but as we are about to depart every man wanted leave and there were horses to be watered fed &amp; rugged up so I had to stop home.  I went into Heliopolis at night after stables met my friends then went home to Shubra [Shubra, a district of Cairo] with them and they gave me a fine reception, as it may be the last time I will see them if we go on Tuesday.  They presented me with a fine box of 100 best Egyptian cigarettes &amp; tobacco pouch unfortunately I returned home late and the O.S. reported me out at roll-call so I have to go to orderly room to-morrow morning.</p>
