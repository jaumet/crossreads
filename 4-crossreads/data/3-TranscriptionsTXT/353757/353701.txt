 This pellet hit my cap badge, cut the chinstrap (which was over the peak) right through &amp; bent the badge double resulting only in a temporary "knocked out" feeling &amp; headache for me.  This might interest you.  At "Lone Pine", about which you'll no doubt have read, I got a bullet at close range through my hat &amp; had my rifle smashed to old iron &amp; matchwood with a shell.  Everyone who lived through those five days (6-11 Augt.) had narrow escapes and many went out for all time.

 A quiet word re Roy Smith.  He was wounded alongside me on the night of land (25 April) &amp; went away to hospital.  He was better in a month &amp; has been enjoying himself in Alexandria ever since.  He hasn't done any scrapping &amp; is not likely to.  Anyway, its like his gory hide to write to the paper &amp; make public an accident to myself which I didn't
