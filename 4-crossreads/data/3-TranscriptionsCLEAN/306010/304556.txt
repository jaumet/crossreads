  
 Jan 12"  (Wednes) Our establishment of Officers has been brought up to date - 2 new Lieut. Colonels & several Majors have been appointed or promoted. Not feeling too good at present - touches of asthma, sore throet & cold in head. Long hours in the Colonel's office and cold, misty damp nights are not too healthy. Jan 20th (Thurs). Feeling pretty fair now but it could be better for me if I could get more exercise in the open. Get up in the morning about 7.15 - just in time to be ready for breakfast at 7.45. Commence work about 8.30. knock off at 12.45 pm for dinner & start again about an hour
