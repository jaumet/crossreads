  
 for every trial, liable to get out of control because of desire to act energetically, impatient in presence of deceit and what may appear to be or is untruthful, unselfish to its own disadvantage, & much else that you, who have had it under observation for many years, know better than does its possessor. 
 Good night.  I shall finish this for posting in the morning.  Good night.  Good night. [A line of Xs and Os.] Caroline [A line of Xs and Os.] Josephine [A line of Xs and Os.] Kathleen. 
 24-4-15 - 3-30 p.m.  This morning I called upon Surgeon General Ford who is the chief in Egypt, had a confidential talk with him about my work & my position here.  I was well pleased at the end of our talk & I would not be surprised if he finds me a new position in the course of an early date.  If he does then Jerrom and I shall leave this rotten show.  My honour & personal reputation are not safe in the weak hands that guide No 2 G. H., and to get away from it will be obeyed by me with the greatest of alacrity & pleasure.  I shall send you a cable announcing my departure should it come about. 
 For the present Goodbye.  God bless all of you.  My best wishes to my friends.  Love to you three & Maria in heaps & kisses in loads.
