My Beloved Mother & Father.I gave the letter I wrote to you to the porter on the train to post. I hope you get it. I was not allowed to tell you that we left from Plymouth. Our train went right down to the dock, and pulled up alongside the ship. Two ships. The first one a german prize in dark grey paint took our 50 staff nurses, and this ship an Aberdeen liner took us the [indecipherable] sisters. Everything was done in orderly fashion, each sister got out of the train
