<p>case of emergency's &amp; if  I can't fix them, then have to rouse up Doctor. Going on tonight with 3 N.S.W. AMC men, think we will get along alright &ndash; got out of sight of land about 10 pm, saw land again about daylight.<br/> Went down to the Cookshop &amp; had a large argument, result can get anything in the eatable line for self &amp; orderlys at midnight &amp; coffee at 6 am.<br/>Very cold all night &ndash; with a fair swell on, have learnt to always give a man a free passage, who is approaching with hand anywhere near his mouth. Still feeling tip top. Have a few cold footers on Board crying to get back to Mother, etc.</p>
