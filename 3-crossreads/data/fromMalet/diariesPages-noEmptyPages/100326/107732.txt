31/8/15 A fairly large roll on and a good many sick. Felt squeamish about bed time and had a great sleep this morning beautiful blue seas and sun with cool breeze. Sharing cabin with Capt Curnow. This boat "Scotian" a fine vessel most comfortable usually on the Canadian run. Boat drill at 11 o'c. All hands standing to their boats. More practice needed as there were too many who did not know where to go. Remember a funny incident marching through Heliopolis. As head of column passed Marche noticed a native woman pushing a cart of sukkar melons. As soon as she saw the soldiers coming she turned round and bolted down side street with her fruit. This happened quite a number of times ? experience teaches them to take no risks with thirsty tired Australians. Small boy singing on Alexandria wharf yesterday to tune of Marsellaise ? words English-Egyptian conveying nothing to the uninitiated. Alexandria harbour full of shipping from all quarters. The chief port for Northern Africa. Before Officers mess Lou P. Hugh B. very p.--d. P. had to retire after a futile effort but B. survived. On boat deck cool breeze so strong as to make walking a difficult process
