 SS Suffolk 24.10.14 Dear Lizzie Just a line to let you know I am having a good trip and not in the least upset by seasickness. As you no doubt know we crossed out on Sunday afternoon. I am sorry I couldn't get over to see you before I left, but the "heads" never even had the decency to give us a few hours to see our people. This is not a bad old boat I believe she is one of the best fitted up of the lot, we are a bit crowded at night in our hammocks. I had the shock of my life last night my hammock came down with me. Our first port of call is to be Albany where we expect to reach tomorrow morning. Ta-ta with fondest love to R&amp;B From yours truly Ken
