<p>15th. Physical jerks again this morning, &amp; I purposely scaled them for I was pretty tired after the picqueting stunt last night. I had a row this morning with one of the most unpopular &amp; rotten good for nothing men as ever breathed Sergt Major Barber of B. Coy. he got the worst of the argument with a vengeance I can tell you.</p>
<p>Received orders to move off at 2 o'clock this afternoon, &amp; I had to report at Battalion Headquarters at 1 o'clock that left me exactly 20 minutes to pack up &amp; eat my dinner so I did not have too much time, however at 1<br/>I reported, &amp; great were the guesse's made as to what</p>
