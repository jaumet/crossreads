<p>22 Aug, 1916<br/>Train Cairo to Alex<br/>Out of quad at last.  Out into the street alive, alive with color &amp; life.  It was a brisk trip in the motor waggon to the station &amp; now we are bowling along on the Train right merrily  What a beaut it is after white wash walls &amp; pyjamas.  On each side extend fields of rich green above it is bright blue.  here &amp; there are drab villages with quiet shades of brown grey &amp; orange only the dome of a mosque showing up with dazzling whiteness in the bright sun shine; patches of date palms with bunches of rich brown &amp; wine colored clusters hanging, &amp; in the field are the people working listlesly.</p>
<p>Along the road we pass some camels moving lazily, an Egyptian on a donkey, looking pompous under his big umbrella,  Above the horizon some clouds as soft looking &amp; white as wool drift ceaslessly along &amp; merge at last into a shimmer among the tree tops.  Egypt! unobstrusive, &amp; quietly [indecipherable] [Line?] your Sphinx, camels, bright star flecked nights, &amp; boundless sandy deserts.</p>
