 Tuesday 23 May 1916 A bright summer's day. Busy getting things packed, going into Etaples to Ordnance &amp; town to make some purchases in the morning. It happened to be market day &amp; the town square presented a very busy scene with sellers of all kinds of wares displaying their goods in temporary booths &amp; on wheelbarrows. Prescott purchased some strawberries at 1f. pr lb. : they looked fairly good but he said they had little flavour.
