7/4/18 ? Albert-Dernacourt Line
between Amiens and Albert. Our cookers are now at Millencourt. Our guard and prisoners are right up in the support trenches. It is a good idea to bring the devils right up forward with us. The weather cleared up later in the day and aircraft were active patrolling up and down the line. Our archies and M.Gs engaged them blazing off much ammunition for nothing. The Boche today has been engaged in blowing to bits the pleasant little villages of Henencourt Millencourt. His artillery has been less active but during the afternoon he got a direct hit right on top of our battalion H.Q.
