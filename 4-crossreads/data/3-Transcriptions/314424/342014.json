<p>Last night was fairly quiet.</p>
<p>Since we came to this camp we have been able to buy fresh cows milk from a Frenchman who passes every morning. He charges 6d a dixie &amp; does a good trade with the troops. I often get some and thoroughly enjoy it. It makes good sap when the bread is steeped in it. We were issued with new shirts &amp; underpants &amp; socks in exchange for dirty ones. Yesterday I did some washing so I have now a clean rig out.</p>
<p>[One line of shorthand &ndash; I wrote to my wife this evening.  Letter 132. 3 pages]</p>
<p>Friday June 14. 1918. 1410<br/>Cold, cloudy &amp; windy.</p>
<p>I finished reading "Chums of the Past Watch" by Harry Campbell, a tale of cadets on board a training ship.</p>
<p>This evening I finished reading a detective story by William Le. Lucre entitled "Inspector Whitlock" Bothe these books are short stories, but very interesting &amp; they fill in the long evenings.<br/>Today has been very quiet.</p>
<p>Saturday June 15. 1918. 1411<br/>A dull cloudy morning but fine. Last night was again quiet.</p>
<p>Jack Boon came back a couple of days ago after being away at the Base in a V.D. hospital. It cost him 18 guineas in loss of pay.</p>
