<p>November 23<br/>only a Picardian peasant &ndash; all her world was in that note &ndash; from some lousy Billet or candle lit dugout. .. I should like to have seen her face&hellip; and his.</p>
<p>A Tram straight away to Wimereux &ndash; and a meeting in the tram of Tom Gale:  he expecting an early return to Australia.  A short year has changed and aged him as ten of old whiles.</p>
<p>Then to the Caf&eacute; &ndash; and an ordering of Cherry Brandies.. then to the Little Caf&eacute; &ndash; for omelette and 'ot Rolls and Coffee &ndash; but 'ot Rolls were of the past six months ago:  so it was bread and butter&hellip;  That cost us 14 F., last year it would have been 8 at the most.  New faces and people at the souvenir shop.&hellip;the dear little woman of the rich talking has gone&hellip;and ugly efficient shopwomen fill her place.</p>
<p>So to the old home,.. and a meeting of old 1st chaps, men looking years younger &amp; well.  [indecipherable] fuller if possible, and Mac., Basil Mac full of light laughing and lounging grace, and a Bath and the seeing again of the old home&hellip;</p>
<p>Jake has been wounded a second time, all the muscle of his left thigh blown away.  This rich lovely bodies beauty broken.. lithe loveliness gone, an offering to bloody horror&hellip;  And I saw the new Jake there&hellip; and there's been tormenting in my mind since, to visualise him, to see and know his beauty&hellip;shorter than Jake, more stockily built, a grace of sensuousness, rather than of litheness and of wood pagan gods&hellip;.</p>
<p>The horrible desire to possess, to absolutely own and know mine, to always have in sight&hellip; to passionately possess&hellip; to utterly destroy in a madness of lust and to entirely absorb till the uttermost beauty is known and realised and is part of self&hellip;  The desire for a beauty that may not be thine&hellip; and that can never in any case be known&hellip;</p>
<p>To Merridens and a buying of Tagore's Stray Birds, of a sketch book and the "Book of Artimis&hellip; a walk around, coffee and cakes, and a Malaga.. so to the tram, to Pont de Brique.,,  Dinner there, and a trip back along misted roads and faint lines of tree silhouettes.</p>
