Thursday 10/5/17
Orders were issued to leave Camp at 5 a.m. on Friday 10/5/17 at Bordon in Hants. Naturally excitement was high amongst the boys at the thought of leaving for France. The day passed of gradually, some writing letters others packing their Kits after Tea we were paraded at 8 p.m to receive our Rations for 24 hours which consisted of 4 Rounds of Bread Meat our Water Bottles full of Tea. After receiving same we were dismissed for the night prepared ourselves for rest but as I anticipated we had very little sleep. The sappers in our hut had previously decided that they were going in for some skylarking with the result that all hands had to join in the fun. As our beds were in two partitions the boys could pull out the front portion double it over the back portion when one was in bed. This skylarking mingled with Singing was kept up till nearly 2 a.m. when they exhausted themselves all hands settled down for 1 hours rest as Reville was sounded at 3 a.m. Breakfast was served at 3.30 am we paraded
