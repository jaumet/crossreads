 1917 APRIL 
 16 MONDAY 
 Fine all day but came on to 
 rain in evening. We left 
 Steenwerck about 9 AM &amp; 
 passed through Bailleul 
 Strazeele &amp; Hazebruck 
 &amp; arrived at Wallen [Chapelle?] 
 about 3.30 pm &amp; picketed 
 the horses in open. We 
 slept in a barn again on 
 straw. We see signs of 
 spring all along the 
 road but its still very cold.
