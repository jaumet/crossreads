<p>11th<br/>Tuesday the 1st &amp; 2nd F. Engineers played the 2nd F. Amb. cricket &amp; lost 114 to 64.  Nothing of importance except wild rumours.</p>

At night there was a concert in the Y.M.C.A. marquee in commemoration of the Anniversary of the day we left Australia, it being just 12 months since we left.  The concert was a good success &amp; the marquee was not nearly large enough to hold the crowds, hundreds sitting outside.</p>

Afterwards we took a walk across the hills &amp; had a good walk.  It is rumoured tonight that the "Australians and Gurkas have taken "Hill 971" &amp; are holding it.  We all hope that the news is correct.</p>
