<p>Rolleston<br/>28.11.16<br/>Dear father,</p>
<p>We received news the other day, of some frightful casualties in the 5th Brigade.  They were evidently shelled in their billets.  Poor old Duffy was killed instantly by a shell falling in his tent.  The first of the Cyclist officers to go out &amp; the best of them.  We were great pals &amp; the news has hit me very hard.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Evan Richards about three weeks after his death.  He spoke of a little guide to Orderly Officers that we had been getting up together before the war, &amp; told me know much he had improved it.  Would you convey my sympathies to Mrs. Richards as I have not her address.  Evan was admired &amp; respected by all the Brigade Officers</p>
