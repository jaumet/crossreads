<p>29th Cold with slight showers of rain. Fritz is still retiring. Our front line is fare beyond Bapaume though I do not know how far. Since the Town Hall was blown up men are afraid (officers incl.) to dwell in the houses of the town. Several explosions took place in the region of Bazentin le Petite during the day.<br/>30th cold with the usual rain. Nothing much doing all day. We are to move out beyond Bapaume very soon. That finishes our dreams for a trip north. Instead we go further into the land of devastation. Raining heavily all night.<br/>31st Still raining heavily. This cleared off during the day</p>
