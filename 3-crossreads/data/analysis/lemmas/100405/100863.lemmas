 Signal ( continu ) And he know from a hundr signal , the buzz call of his own . The break and the vibrant stress ? The Z and the G and the S 's , That call his hand to the answer key and his mouth to the microphon . For alway the laid gun fret On the word that his mouth shall utter , When rifl and maxim stutter , And the rocket volley to starward from the spurt parapet ; And alway his ear must hark to the voic out of the dark ? For the whisper over the wire From the bomb and the batter trench , Where the wound moan on the mire ? For a sign to waken the thunder which shatter the night asund With the flash of the leap muzzl and the beat of batteri fire .
