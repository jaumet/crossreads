<p>I&#39;ll put in a couple of chapters on the uses and abuses of bayonets and telephone wire. A bayonet is used for wood chopping, toasting bread, opening tins and earth pins for telephones. Telephone wire is mainly used for boot laces, trouser buttons and building biveys etc. Am going to call the next chap now Mother and then turn it, will finish &amp; post this tomorrow if possible also one to Father. Good night. Next Day.</p>
<p>I went over and saw Tom Harris this morning and was asking him about the Science course at the Uni. Tom was a med student before he came away. He told me all about it and he said he has a brother-in-law who went through the course and is now O.C. Brisbane Museum. So that ought to just about suit Hal - and the course ought to make him a very wise man. I&#39;m glad he is taking it on. He will have to teach me a lot of things I want to know when I get back, but I guess Fred &amp; I will stick to the Corriedales. Am posting a letter to Father also today. Love to the boys &amp; yourself. I am Your loving son Robert C. Wilson</p>
