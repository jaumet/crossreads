Home sister gives me a cup of tea 6.30 a.m. so suppose am very favored, they are kindness itself but I should like to be on duty as soon as these legs feel strong enough.<br/>2.30 p.m. went to Cairo with S. Watson &amp; shopped till 5 p.m., then Groppi's for tea.  Managed well though our French being nil &amp; no knowledge of current coins the same, shopping is difficult.

Photos piastres 7 for a roll of 10 to be developed.<br/>Home by tram (1/2 piastre for 2 A.A.N.S.).  The women cover their faces but expose their breasts at times.  Quantities of jewellery worn &amp; thick anklets of silver.</p>
