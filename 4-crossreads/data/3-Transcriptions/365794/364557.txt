<p>Tuesday 4 June 1917 [1918]<br/>Sister Leed's "day off" so I run the ward &amp; only difficulty is my not being used to the military papers, transfers, etc. &amp; the M.O. (a lady) is a sad muddler.  Comes 9 a.m., does a little bit, returns 11 a.m., goes, returns 12.40 p.m., leaves 1 p.m., returns 7 p.m. to ? &amp; does 2 atropine tests for ty.  Atropine 1/300 given, pts. reacted slowly (stuff given very old).  One pt., Sheward, result of blood culture positive so transferred to Choubra, other, Beatty, negative.<br/>Off 2-5 p.m., rested.  Oh how good to have pro tem a room to one's self.  Letter with N. Crookey, may sit Sept. '18.</p>
