Wednesday February 14thWe are having a considerable number of changes regarding Officers. Handed gas helmets in for examination. An examination will be held on such every Wednesday afternoon. Had a good few patients through during the day. Wrote three letters during the afternoon. Handed pay books in for new ones to be issued full particulars taken.
Thursday February 15thThis last couple of days there has been a great number of 13th Btn men go through here with scabies. Saw Sid Cooper this evening, he informed me that all the fellows I know came through the stunt alright. He also spoke of the experience he went through. Beautiful day all day, the sun was quite warm for a change.
Friday February 16thOwing to Lance Corporal McGregor (in charge of "receiving point)" being promoted to Waggon Orderly Cpl, & taking over his duties as such, we now have another Lance Cpl in charge. We have a great deal of discipline in this camp now, blankets are to be rolled in a certain way, must be neat & level, then great coat, pack, steel helmet, gas respirator, & equipment must be put in regulation fashion, such to the desire of a well hated Major we have in our unit. Very easy day, had hardly any patients. Mail closed for Australia today. Rained during the afternoon.
Saturday February 17thShowery rain nearly all day. Very foggy this afternoon & evening. Everywhere is very boggy. The Sergeant Cook here is as funny as a circus, if you call him Sergeant upon approaching him for anything, he will give you absolutely anything you require, but! Call him Copey (his name is Copeland) & you will get nothing but a growl, of course I always allude to him as sergeant.
