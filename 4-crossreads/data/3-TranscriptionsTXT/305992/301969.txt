1 pm proceeded in & aided by two tugs the harbor being small & conjested by battleships cruisers & destroyers.2 pm Moored to bouys fore & aft. The Naval people came off & examined the crew of 195 all told. 3 Greek stewards we shipped at Alexandria Egypt last trip on examination here were found to be Turkish subjects with unauthorised passports. These were taken ashore under escort & interned yet these three were shipped through the British Consul at Alexandria, so therefore the British authorities there are to be blamed.The harbor & town is a very picturesque place. Very strongly fortified the old forts being still intact. We are moored 100 yards from the entrance & 50 yards of the mine field that protects same so that we are within a few yards of dozens of submerged mines & booms. In a very dangerous position should we by any chance break away from our moorings.The town contains nice & lovely buildings. Clean & well laid out water fronts & streets but like the French & Italian towns very gay. We are taking in here 400 tons of Welsh coal & have had orders to leave tomorrow for Alexandria.
