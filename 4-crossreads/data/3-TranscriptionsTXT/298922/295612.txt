 Friday 8th November 1917 
 Today I took the Isherwoods to the Australian Club for Lunch &amp; afterwards to the Australia House in the Strand &amp; saw the Lord Mayors Procession, had afternoon tea with the High Commissioner, Andy Fisher!!! in the evening dinner at the Carlton &amp; went to see CHU CHIN CHOW. 
 It worries me spending all this money but it cannot be helped at present. 
 Good news from GAZA in the Papers but ITALY!!!!
