<p>3<br/>scene from my mind. I can't convey it <strike>too</strike> to you, just as I can't the many wonderful sights I have since seen, or the many wonderful things I have since heard. Splendissimus! Splendissimus is the only adjective for it.</p>

<p>A sea trip is always a sea trip, and it has its little ups and downs. Sometimes they are big ups &amp; downs : then things get lively, but when you are travelling non de lux as we are, the minor variety of ups &amp; downs are quite sufficient.

We found New South Wales Infantry, 3 companies of about 180 men each, a number of Queensland A.M.C, probably about 50, and our own unit, No. 1 Australian Hospital Ship, about 88 in all.
