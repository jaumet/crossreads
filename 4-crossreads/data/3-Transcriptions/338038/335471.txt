<p>Egypt &amp; Gallipoli as well as in France.  On every occasion &amp; under all conditions he has proved himself an able soldier and an excellent officer.  His cheerful courage, sustained &amp; inspiring energy has at all times been an example to his brother officers &amp; the men under his command.  I have lost, in him, an experienced Battery Commander &amp; an officer of proved ability, whose personality &amp; service I cannot replace.<br/>He was severely wounded while commanding his battery in the strenuous action on the 5th April 1918, &amp; died very shortly afterwards.  His work throughout that day was but typical of the whole of his service, Devotion to Duty &amp; the most efficient control &amp; direction of his guns to the last, from what I know of him he would have desired no better death.<br/>We have had, I regret to say, many casualties amongst our "Gunners", there is none we shall miss more than your son.<br/>Though we cannot lessen you sorrow, may I again assure, Sir, that you irreparable son is shared by us all.<br/>Believe me.<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>W.L.H. Burgess. Brig. Gen.<br/>Commanding 4th Aust. Div. Artillery</p>
