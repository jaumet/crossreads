And now we are here waiting to sail for Egypt and ever the troops are rolling from Helles- Scotch English and French- all of whom have left many dear pals behind them, those who have gone west, those who doing their long last sentry-go on those blood-stained shores- Gallipoli.  And so a chapter has closed in all our lives and we look out into the dim future- a future potent with interest, full of surprise and certainly full of battle-fields in some country new to us. Perhaps it will be France, we all hope so but certainly it will be the hard cold sands of the desert for more of the galling training which has helped so much during these past months.
