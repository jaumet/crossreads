just now.  They are like yours, a very varied lot.
We have cricket matches & football (going out fast weather too hot) & feats of strength & agility.  I don't take part, I sit & watch & make ribald remarks as per usual.
I have no news at all, things are much quieter here but anyhow you'll know more about it than me.  Nearly all our crowd are out & away, we are the last, the un lucky last.  I shall be thankful & glad to get away & hope we never come back here & so does every one.  We've had rather a rotten time.
Fritz is rather annoying at times, he splashes his little souvenirs round at odd times.  I sometimes lie in bed & listen to them coming over & landing about quite handy.  I don't quite like it.  Still we have astonishing luck & its marvellous how little damage &c. he causes.
You know that picture of Bainsfather, [Bairnsfather] "My dream for years to come", well that's me, only I'm in a tent.
Do you remember Ted Watkins, he seems to know you, he is in the Battery, you'll know which one I mean & I like him.  He's quite well up in books & music & we swap literature.
