<p>France<br/>21st July  1917. (1916?)</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>Am sorry I can't write a longer letter this time, but we are pretty busy.  Was very pleased to hear from yours of the 4th June that you got 3 of my letters.  It was beginning to worry me that none of them had been getting through.  Was also pleased to hear that you heard from the other boys.  Have seen nothing of any of them so far, or Tom Croft either, though fully expect to bump some of them soon.  Am very glad to say that the parcel with the silk underbelows came along.  The only fault I've got with them is that they remind me too much of better days.</p>
<p>Getting pretty used to March ing now &ndash; We are still at it.  The tucker over here is a Paris House dinner as compared to what we had on Gallipoli, so we are in a better condition to be able to stand it.  Thanks for the address of Miss Tolefree.  Hope to be able to use it, but I'm afraid now England is only one of the many dreams we have had shattered.  Hope the other boys have a chance to see something.</p>
<p>Have not seen anything of Charlie W. since we started to walk, but he was thriving the last time I saw him.  This hard living has the curious effect of agreeing with some people you perhaps never thought it would have.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Mr. Croft last mail.  He seems to be pretty pleased now that Tom has joined up.  Tom should go a long way over here considering he started with 2 Stripes.  There's plenty of room for promotion here for anybody that goes looking for it.</p>
<p>Well I think I'd better close and try and get a little sleep.  We don't get too much these days.</p>
<p>Hope all are well at Home,<br/>Love to all,<br/>From<br/>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
