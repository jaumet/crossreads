 Plenty of aerial work this morning Fritz very daringly came very low destroyed one of our balloons. The division is to be relieved tomorrow the rumour is that we go to Belgium. This evening many aerial combats took place in which one Fritz plane was destroyed came down in our lines. Very fine sight.

 March back to Pozieres where we expect to stay a couple of days before we go back further. Tomorrow Anzac Day is to be celebrated we are going to have a ?beano?. Rather a coincidence being at Pozieres. A monument is being erected to the fallen of 1st Aust Division many to separate battalions. 
 Beautiful day.
