<p>November 20<br/>135.<br/>The night of the 18th, read in bed, Masefield's "Good Friday":  rather disappointing &ndash; though the Madman a richly fine character.  Pages 44, 45, &amp; 46 high above the remainder.  More of a dramatic essay than "A play in verse".</p>
<p>The night of the 19, the first play of Tagore's "Sacrifice" collection&hellip;  A Noh play of Nature triumphant&hellip; its rapid ending was a shock, reading I turned the page for its continuing.. then I slept on it&hellip;</p>
<p>To night I'll read 'Sacrifice' again. .. Chastelard I'll put aside for reading when all I have is through.</p>
<p>Today I wrote to T.B.C. for Babfords Building Construction Elementry.  The first chance I see I'll try for a drafting job on staff &ndash; the unit's rotten through and through &ndash; the officers more ridiculous than socialistic amateurs.  Yesterday morning on parade the Colonel shifty and poor, all his statements for a permanent guard etc. being totally ignored by the W.O. &ndash; the only Military man in the whole show:  not that Militarism is necessary, but a certain amount of unit spirit and discipline should somewhere obtain.</p>
<p>November 20<br/>Yesterday's mail, the T.L.S's Nov. 8 and 15, announcement of column 'John YKats' &ndash; 18/-.</p>
<p>This afternoon a kit inspection, general borrowing front and rear lines&hellip; of sox, shirts, etc., a farce ridiculously gone through &ndash; a farce and an indignity.</p>
<p>136.<br/>Billeted in high hilly and deep valley'd country of perfect colours under grey skies&hellip;wide landscape Hardy would write well of.</p>
<p>The Billet a long divided up barn &ndash; one of three forming the side of a great quadrangle, the cottage closing the fourth.  In the square &ndash; all roughly cobbled and unevenly sunken a great mud, manure, straw and filth heap and rising from the centre of it all, a decayed dovecot&hellip;.  our fatigue yesterday and today clearing up where the rotting heap too far trespassed.  A smelly dirty job &ndash; especially for the Aristocrats.</p>
<p>Clarrie, Bill Tell and self, in for Boulogne leave for Thursday&hellip; Ambulance wagon from here:  3 from each section, two transports.</p>
<p>Mail today so far nothing heard of:  box open now for ordinary envelopes.</p>
