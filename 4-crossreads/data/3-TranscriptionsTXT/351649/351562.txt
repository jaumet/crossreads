 imagine them just as I saw them last, the brats, growing up are they?  I grudge very much the cut this war's taking out of our lives:  however its got to be done, but I'm looking forward to the end of it. 
 I had a letter from Mrs. Billy Ellis from New Zealand.  She writes regularly to me:  they were all well at the time. 
 And now I shall stop for today.  I've given you absolutely all the news I've got and there isn't any more to tell about this side of the world:  we shall be busy for the next couple of days getting into action again, our rest is finished. 
 Give my love to old John &amp; to Graham &amp; to you. 
 Cheer ho &amp; every good luck go with you all. 
 Yours sincerely Jock C. Ellis
