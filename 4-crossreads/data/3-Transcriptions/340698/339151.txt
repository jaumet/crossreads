<p>26/10/16<br/>Done all kinds of fatigues last night. The majority of us were carrying sleepers up a hill for the purpose of constructing a road.</p>
<p>29/10/16<br/>Went into line today 2 coys in line and 2 in supports. We expect to do a stunt shortly. Can see the spires of Bapuame from our position. This seems to be a very big move and I hear our objective is Bapuame</p>
