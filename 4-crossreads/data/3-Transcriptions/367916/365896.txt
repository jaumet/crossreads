<p>found out yet whether he is staying here or whether he has gone on to England but I will enquire from the O.C. Aust. Flying Squadron when I see him.</p>
<p>I heard about a week ago some further news about my brother who is in hospital in Birmingham. It seems he has had a double fracture of the L femur &ndash; one in the middle 1/3 &amp; one involving the hip joint. I expect he will finish up with some stiffness &amp; deformity of the leg which will probably mean his being returned to Australia. He is very lucky to have got off so well &amp; I shall be glad to hear that he is being returned.</p>
<p>The Hospital he was in at Etaples was bombed three times while he was there &ndash; over 300 casualties resulted &amp; the buildings considerably damaged. I think that gave the poor chap a good shaking but he wrote quite cheerfully from England.</p>
<p>The news from the Western front seems distinctly good lately. Each success we have sets one wondering if the end is not coming soon but still the show drags on. Still I suppose "Say not the struggle naught availeth etc" is the policy.</p>
<p>I have been up in Jerusalem a couple of times recently. It is getting pretty warm up there now too but the air is much better than here. The train runs up to there now &amp; the place is beginning to show</p>
