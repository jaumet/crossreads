 &quot;Forget It&quot; 
 If you see a tall fellow ahead of a crowd 
 A leader of men marching fearless &amp; proud 
 And you know of a tale whose mere telling aloud 
 Would cause his proud head&nbsp; ^  to &nbsp;in anguish&nbsp;be bowed 
 Its a pretty good plan to forget it. 
 &nbsp; 
 If you know of a thing that would darken the joy 
 Of a man or a woman, a girl or a boy 
 That will wipe out a smile or the least way annoy 
 A fellow or cause any gladness to cloy 
 Its a pretty good plan to forget it. 
 &nbsp; 
 The easiest &amp; best way to expand the chest is to have a large heart in it. 
 &nbsp; 
 Success don&#39;t konsist&nbsp;in never makin&#39;&nbsp;blunders, but in never making the same one twice.&nbsp;&mdash; 
 Josh Billings
