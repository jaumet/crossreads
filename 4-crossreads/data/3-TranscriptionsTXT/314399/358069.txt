Thursday 13 March 1919Rain all the afternoon but was very nice in the morning. Went to Mountivilliers for a stroll. Did quite a lot of renovating in the hut. Played basketball at the gym. Gee I'm soft. Very. Had a talk with [indecipherable], Gray, Laggugreen & Freckleton. They are all down waiting to go home.
Friday 14 March 1919On boat picquet today. Left here at 3 pm & got back at 8 pm. No trouble at all. Saw some of the old [indecipherable] off. Very cold tonight.
