 [Typed letter on Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence, Melbourne letterhead] A.I.F. 122/1/52 No. 94130 November 1916. 
 [Stamped Nov -3 1918] Dear Sir, 
 With reference to your letter of the 24th. ulto., in further reference to the Third Divisional Cyclist Co., I desire to inform you that no information is available in this office regarding the units to which the members of the Company have been transferred but the advices regarding the new organisation indicated that the units had been merged. 
 It is of course quite possible that the members of this Company may, owing to the exigencies of the service, have been transferred to other units in which they may have been urgently required, but the returns of such transfers may not come to hand for some considerable time. 
 Yours faithfully [Signed] T Trumble Wan 
 His Honor Mr. Justice Ferguson Judges' Chambers, Supreme Court Sydney  N.S.W.
