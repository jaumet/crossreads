<p>7<br/>I enter the wood, and wanter some distance in till I find a tree more aged tan the rest, and larger, its rugged butt green with moss.</p>
<p>It seems good to rest upon the sweetness of the fallen needles there with my back against the mossy butt.</p>
<p>Seated in this wood alone I am not lonely</p>
<p>I am strangely befriended by all that is round me.</p>
<p>Almost there is intense silence. A silence which seems to dream</p>
<p>There is stillness</p>
<p>Stillness, which holds, as it were the very breath of movement</p>
<p>Stillness so perfect it pictures silence, and make silence absolute and local</p>
<p>The little which is not of silence is remote</p>
<p>There is no stirring of the air</p>
<p>There is stillness</p>
<p>Profound stillness</p>
