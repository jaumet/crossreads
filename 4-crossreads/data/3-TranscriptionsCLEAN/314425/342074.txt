  
 and the billets that we used to sleep in were wrecked. I hear that 27 were killed and over a hundred wounded all Australians. Before we left Lamotte camp the Transport of the 28 Battalion 2. Division were there waiting to go in. They will have a good place as we made a lot of improvements including a good wall 5 ft high all round the horses and mules to protect them from the bombs and shells. We did not stay at the old camp at Allonville but passed on through 
 the village through the aerodrome and on to a wood were we unlimbered and stayed for the night. I am on 2 picquet tonight 11.30 to 2.a.m. 2 1/2 hours. All the drivers but one are out tonight. They had to return to bring on the officers things and some of the Q.M. stores 
 Thursday June 27. 1918. 1423. A beautiful day. Last night a fleet of enemy planes came over and dropped bombs on adjacent villages. There was a large number of them and a great many bombs were dropped
