 5-12-16 went to Arnussi &amp; found it deserted, the New Zealanders who took over from us left last night. We watered &amp; fed our horses there &amp; arrived back in Camp before sundown &amp; arranged for a half limber to go to Mazar tomorrow to take in some spare Signalling stores I can do without &amp; bring back wire, we are not allowed lights after dark. A Troop of the 2nd Regt with some Engineers go out tonight to Wadi El Arish to tap for water; at Gererat water is 20 ft below the surface &amp; there is a difficulty of getting water at all further out along this flank; the Troop going out tonight are on a risky job as they will be right among the Turkish Outposts &amp; patrols &amp; only a few miles from El Arish itself. An enemy 'plane dropped 3 bombs today on the 2nd L.H. Regt while they were watering but did no damage, she did not go within range of our Anti Air Craft guns at Mazar.
