12/9/17 Campagne
Reveille at 3 am and a breakfast by the light of candles. Batmen and others rushing round packing up. The whole family turned out to see us off and the poor Marie cried but a few kisses fixed her up. Pitch dark morning inclined to rain but afterwards cleared up. An officer of the Gordon Highlanders stayed with us prior to taking over the billets. At a little after 5.30 a.m. the Battalion about 950 moved off leaving a loading party behind to load up our two motor lorries and g.s. wagons. Moved through to Renscure and Ebblinghem. As soon as the light grew, inspected the column and the transport and found all smart and correct except the cookers which, although newly painted, were all cumbered with gear packs etc etc, one lot of cooks having even built a superstructure for their cooker. Ordered the whole lot to be dumped at the first halt and after that the cookers looked well. Pulled up on a paddock at 7.30
