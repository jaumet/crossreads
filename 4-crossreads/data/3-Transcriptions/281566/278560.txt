<p>Thursday 8th June saw us again on the move for the trenches. A soaking steady rain fell as we marched in making the foot-hold on the duck-boards very unclean  &amp;  as usual stirring the unboarded trenches into a gummy slush which adhered to everything it touched. Everything was very quiet. The German lines at this point were from 250 to 450 yards apart  &amp;  grass a yard high mingled with the mangled stumps of trees  &amp;  the wire entanglements in the intervening "No-mans land".</p>
<p>Our artillery on the 9th aggravated Fritz to the extent that he threw over a dozen or so coal-boxes which made an awful noise  &amp;  and scattered a few loose sand-bags but did nothing further. However had he been allowed to persist at the game he may have rendered some of us homeless or at least "dug-out-less" for the night but our light field guns  &amp;  quick firers began to play havoc with his parapets he desisted. As the afternoon cleared off there was considerable aerial activity both our A.A. Guns &amp;  the German's &ndash; but particularly the latter's &ndash; wasting hundreds of shells  &amp;  covering half the sky with a canopy of shell-smoke.<br/>[Two sketches of bullets exploding in the air; bomb exploding on the ground, captioned: A German "Coal-Box"]</p>
