<p>Tuesday July 10th<br/>Word came back that my leave was turned down, so all my made up plans are now squashed. I never said a word either when they put my name up on the "not approved" list, &amp; still believe the proper person never saw it, never mind I will put in again later. Three of us here go down to the Salvation Army or Y.M.C.A hut every evening now &amp; have supper, we are coming out some, I can tell you. I have met a good few fellows I knew in France, over here, most of them have been wounded.</p>
<p>Wednesday July 11th<br/>Today was the first day I have gone for a walk out of camp, it was only then a chap wanted to purchase some goods down at Shipton village, &amp; he persuaded me to go for a walk with him. Everyone who receives over 14 days detention here is sent to Wandsworth, on the Isle of Wight to complete his term.</p>
<p>Thursday July 12th<br/>Pad day, I did not draw any for myself, but drew &pound;2 for a pal who is on leave. We are having lovely weather here now. The Russians on the Eastern Front have appeared to wake up, they have started "pushing".</p>
