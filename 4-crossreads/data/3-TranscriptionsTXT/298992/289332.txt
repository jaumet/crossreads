 H.T, "Seang Bee" A48 Near Colombo 5.3.15 
 Dear Mrs Fry 
 A line to let you know that Alan &amp; myself are in the best of health &amp; spirits. We are today crossing the line &amp; preparations are going ahead for the reception of King Neptune. The sea today is just like glass &amp; the weather beautiful. We expect to arrive at Colombo about Monday &amp; expect to stay there for at least 50 hours. I am of course going ashore although NO leave is to be granted &amp; am arranging for Alan to go with me. "INFLUENCE" again. &ndash; We are running a magazine on board &amp; I am acting in the capacity of Editor. I am having it printed in Colombo &amp; Alan is sure to send you a copy which you will find very amusing. Kindest regards to all 
 Sincerely Yrs. R Thompson
