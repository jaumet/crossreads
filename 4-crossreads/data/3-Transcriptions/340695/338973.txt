<p>The little girl Blanche was a darling about 6 years old, jove we had some games with her. She spoke English very well so did her mother both having spent 18 months in England. The father couldn't speak a word &amp; it was funny to hear the little kid interpreting she was a wonder. Would come in every morning &amp; try to pull us out of bed. She could recite small pieces of poetry in English her favourite was "my letter". She would make us imaginary morning &amp; afternoon tea with her toy set &amp; sometimes would do us a dinner. We taught her how to play grab with the cards &amp; several other games.</p>
