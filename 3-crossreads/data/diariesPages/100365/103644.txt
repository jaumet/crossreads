Neither one or the other understanding each other, however they all know the one word Beer". So they get on alright.The food is becoming a bit monotonous now, as we have been living on Bully Beef Meat vegetable rations for a long while, would all welcome a meal of fresh meat.We have been in the habit of purchasing bread from the French Farms as we pass through you should see the size of the loaves. We call them Cart wheels, each one weighs 9 lbs. However they have stopped this now as the people have to conserve their Flour supply so (finis Bread).
