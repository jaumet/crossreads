<p>Copy sent to Mother<br/>(No 12)<br/>Troopship Kyarra"<br/>Alexandria Egypt<br/>17 Jany. 1915<br/>My dearest old Mrs.,<br/>I think I ended up my last letter telling you of our safe arrival at Colombo on 26th December.   On the 27th most of the officers &amp; nurses went ashore before breakfast &amp; got the early train to Kandy, having breakfast on the train on the way up.   Major Grey &amp; I went ashore after breakfast.  I first went along to Cook's office to find out the times of arrival of the Demosthenes at intermediate ports &ndash; I then went to the telegraph office &amp; cabled to you "Well, cable Colombo your movements"   I left instructions for them to forward any reply to the Kyarra.  We then did the sights of the town in rickshaws.   We first visited the fruit &amp; vegetable markets &amp; here sampled many queer articles of diet.   We then went out to a Buddhist temple &amp; saw a reclining figure of Buddha 18 feet long.  Our [indecipherable] wanted us to take off our boots &amp; enter the holy of holies but we did not think the game was worth the [indecipherable]   We visited quire a number of odd corners in this temple &amp; at each corner was a priest with shaven head &amp; yellow mantle.   They each had something to show us &amp; at the end of the showing the plate was handed round for our offering!   If this pleased them they beamed on us</p>
