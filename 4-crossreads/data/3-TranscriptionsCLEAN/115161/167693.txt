I went through this beautiful city several times, about this period and there was hardly a soul there.  It was a dead city.  No life at all, what people remained were living in cellars or the catacombs.  It was most uncanny.
After about three weeks here we move on to a large village on a hill
GLISY.
the most nerve-racking place I have been to yet.  Shells have not played havoc with this place so far, but we are unpleasantly "near".  To get to this village we had to cross the Somme, by means of a plank road over the lowlying [low lying] portions, and there were many small bridges which were erected for the quick despatch of troops, the larger ones being for transport wagons and other heavy things.  The enemy was continuously shelling and bombing these bridges.  Our position was a pretty rotten one, as our only means of escape if the enemy suddenly advanced - was by these bridges.  We were sandwiched between the enemy and the Somme, the former being only a very short distance away.
A battery of big guns was immediately at the back of this village and a large French gun moved forward and backward continuously on the railway line which was within a few yards of the billet we occupied.  The noise caused by the guns was deafening, and the replies made by the enemy came perilously near to the building we occupied, and nightly "he" would come over bombing the railway bridge - about fifty yards from our domicile - and during the day the shells were pretty continuous.
