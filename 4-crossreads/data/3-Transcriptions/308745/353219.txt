<p>John Pockley<br/>1.12.07 [?]<br/>Night<br/>The night is come, fragrant and pure the air,<br/>Dread mystic silence haunts the deepening gloom,<br/>In deepest shadows ghoulish phantoms crouch,<br/>Tiny bright fireflies glitter here and there.</p>
<p>Man rests, thankful his days work is o'er<br/>Dull, heavy, slumber, weary limbs relaxed,<br/>Care banished to the nowhere land, and toil<br/>Forgotten quite by nature's kindly law.</p>
<p>E'en nature sleeps, no sounds the silence stir<br/>Save the lofty leafy whispers overhead,<br/>The mournful hoot of some far distant owl,<br/>Solitary, amid your gloomy clump of fir</p>
<p>And now above you mass of rugged rock<br/>Glides into view the slowly rising moon,<br/>Majestic, calm, bathing the world in light,<br/>Soft clinging light, which gloomy shadows mock.</p>
<p>Upwards unhindered mounts the pale face moon,<br/>Shedding dim radiance on all sleeping things,<br/>Then slowly downwards slips towards the Earth,<br/>And to the dawn gives room.</p>
