<p>year.<br/>Well Miss King we did not have a very good Christmas as none of our comforts arrived but suppose they will come later. It was a very miserable Xmas but there are better times coming and if we don't have the next one home well I will be very disappointed.</p>
<p>I am expecting something good too come off for us but cannot mention it at present perhaps you know if not will let you know later.</p>
<p>I have not much news to tell you at present so will close wishing you are all well and that you had an enjoyable time at Christmas at Elga.</p>
<p>I will now close with best wishes and kind regards to all at Elga<br/>Yours Sincerely<br/>Robert Otto, 2nd Btn AIF.</p>
