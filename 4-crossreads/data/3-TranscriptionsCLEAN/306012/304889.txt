  
 fine chateau at Les Alencons.  Incidentally we went through Amiens.  And what a change!  No longer is it the busy, prosperous town of yore - a city of the dead.  We traversed street after street entirely deserted save for a few odd British & French military policemen and 2 or 3 old civilians.  The place has been heavily shelled & bombed and numerous houses are in ruins or have been damaged by shellfire.  The Cathedral has not escaped;  a shell having gone through the roof.  The place has quite a depressing effect on one - a great city deserted by its population of many thousands.  Will it follow the fate of Rheims?  I hope not.  About a dozen shells fell in the town this morning, killing a couple of tommies.
