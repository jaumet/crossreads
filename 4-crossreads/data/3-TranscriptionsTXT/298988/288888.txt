Destroyers had arrived & that the submarine had submerged.
There is evidently three subs there.  It's a bit of a record to get three "S.O.S." calls in less than hour from different ships.
Its pleasing to know however that the three ships escaped.
July 3rd  8.30 a.m.  Lands End wireless station just sent a message to say that a steamer in Lat 49N Long 6W was being chased by a submarine & that the ship was now stationery & was being shelled, so suppose it will soon be sunk.  Our press news last night gave the news of six steamers being sunk.  On coming down to breakfast this morning Our Captain said "We are now safe thanks to the gallant Captain.  We of course are also complimenting him on having altered our course.
We also went over close to a Tramp steamer that was making for the submarine area & told him what was going on, so he altered his course & came in with us.  He had no wireless & the Skipper thanked us effusively.
Noon  Passed Beachy Head (Eastbourne).  The white cliffs of ye old England look good too.
4 p.m.  Arrived at Folkstone & am now passing through the entrance left in the submarine net that is stretched across the channel from Dover to Calais 22 miles.
There are about 50 Trawlers & one or two Destroyers patrolling it, in order to drag up the subs as they get caught.  There have been quite a lot too.
