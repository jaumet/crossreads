 within a few yards of the line & even in the line, the Y.M.C.A. has its free coffee stall where troops can always get a cup of tea or cocoa, they are great.   I can  I am afraid this letter is not very newsy but now we cant say anything about our own doings.  It is hard to write a good letter.  Give my love to Aunt & Uncle.
