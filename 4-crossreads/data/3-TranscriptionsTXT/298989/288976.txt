 4/2/16 Another very lazy day. Out at early patrol wandering round. After breakfast heard a burst of rifle fire followed by scattered shots about 2 miles South &ndash; Sou'West. Outpost reported the same thing. Received word Major Norris 7th Dvn Training Camp is to be LtCol and command here. Practised range taking with the mekometer before lunch. Teeth gritting upon the sand in every dish at mess. A cool southerly wind raising fine drifting sand which penetrates everywhere in a fine layer. Last night the sun went down in a kind of fog of sand in suspense in the air. The tops of the sand hills when you get on top seem to be shifting almost bodily &ndash; the sand is never at rest, the particles are always shifting and moving and even on the stillest night if one listens intently a subdued sound like a distant sea can be heard which tells of the ceaseless rolling of this sand ocean. 
 Round "A" Coys forward trenches and the picquet line. The men busy entrenching and the 23rd Batt on the right getting into position. Our No 1 picquet very visible owing to mess tins reflecting the sun over the skyline. From "Nowhere" came 7 camels driven by lean ragged Bedouins wearing the burnous a veiled woman driving a flock of goats and kids and some ragged children acting as goatherds. A few live fowls tied on to the camel's saddles. How do these folk manage to subsist in the desert, where no water is. 
 Our machine gunners &amp; sigs. returned from school some more leave tomorrow. A mail of parcels came in per camel. Presided in evening over meeting of the general Sports Committee and accepted programme of Sports for Sunday week. Estimated firing heard this morning was five miles away &ndash; sound travels on the wind. Quiet camp all go to bed early, in every tent is a little card school playing by candle light. Bird had two men made 1500 piastres at "Heart &amp; Anchor". Who'll have a card", "Come on my lucky lad!"
