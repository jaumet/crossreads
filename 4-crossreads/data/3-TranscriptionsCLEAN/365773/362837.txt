Again I have been neglecting you & again the same old excuse - too busy etc. Had a very decent batch of mail from home a week ago, including several from you & Beres scarf & I thank the dear little kiddie very much indeed for her kind thought of me & convey my fondest love to her.Well my dear I am a busy man nowadays, I rejoined & was at once placed in charge of a Company - am now O.C. A Coy. have four other officers with me & am having a very good run, a Captaincy is looming up on the horizon & will come along with any luck at any old time
