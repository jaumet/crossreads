<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; THURSDAY 6&nbsp;&nbsp; JULY</p>
<p>A nice warm day, but it came onto rain late at night &amp; washed us all down from upstairs&nbsp; A big Greek boat came through our lines early in morning &amp; made off towards the East. We had a full dress parade in the morning and then we had to set to and clean all our gear brass studs ect in afternoon. They say they sighted some destroyers from the bridge about 3 pm and they are keeping just in front of us. Billy Hunter very crook indeed think it is a tutch of malaria. Heard the &quot;Marmora&quot; had been sunk in Bay of Biscay just ahead of us, but it is not comfirmed yet.</p>
