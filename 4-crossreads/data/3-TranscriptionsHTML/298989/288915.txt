<p>Anzac<br/>20/12/15<br/>The proposal to tie bombs &amp;c on to hats and other articles in the trenches so any inquisitive Turks who picked them up, would be blown to pieces was vetoed on the grounds of humanity &ndash; quite wrongly I think as all is fair and we are out to kill.</p>
<p>The evacuation was a thorough success and the enemy completely bluffed. The cost was large. We left behind in Anzac hundreds of good shells, millions of rounds of SAA and thousands of pounds worth of stores. A lot was destroyed by us but they acquired a lot of valuable munitions and provisions. Into our latrine pit we threw 70000 rounds SAA 1500 grenades and bombs. The enemy are welcome to this if they like to clean it. The men punctured all bully tins and cut up their waterproof sheets. In one place they had erected a big board placarded all over with ribald postcards and cartoons of Kaiser Bill and the Sultan and underneath was the legend scrawled in lead pencil. "Abdul: you silly c &ndash; "! And so he was, to be fooled so easily.</p>
<p>All the way down the tracks and gullies were pads of blankets and strips of cloth that had come undone from the mens boots. I worked my moccasins puttee fashion and they wore through the soles before I had started to go down the track. Still dark we clustered on the after deck of a slate coloured steamer about 6000 tons. From Suvla came the sight of a large fire which was their tents burning and stores fired. A lot of transports were standing out from there having taken the troops off. We weighed anchor before dawn and I rolled up in a blanket I had carried over my arm from the trenches and dozed till 0600 when the biting cold woke me. Got up and met Stewart also prowling found saloon crowded with officers and men all filthy dirty lying huddled up on the floor. Had some breakfast and then laid down on a heap</p>
