Billeted in a very large school, which is being used as an advanced dressing station; also supplying men for the trenches.  Town knocked about owing to the continuous bombardment by the enemy. 
 Saturday 23.9.16 Walked to the Northern part of the town while off duty.  Whole of this portion practically deserted.  Streets practically covered with barbed wire & grown over with grass; every indication of heavy street fighting having taken place in this part of the town.
