morning. He boarded her on my behalf & established a naval guard, instructing the Captain not to leave before my arrival. As I could not leave the "Rheno" till she was anchored, however, the Major preceded me. I followed as soon as we had got our cable.The "Gabriel" is comfortably arranged but resembles a Noah's Ark, being exceedingly top-heavy. There were two passengers aboard bound for Hatzfeldt Hafen & one priest on his way to Alexis. These were transferred to the "Witu" during the following forenoon & left for Hatzfeldt, the soldiers on the "Witu" transhipping to the "Gabriel". During the afternoon the "Lili", "Rheno", & "Davapia" came alongside & discharged their cargo & passengers into the "Gabriel" which will now proceed to "Eitape", the remainder of the fleet returning to Alexis & Madang. The "Lili" is to again load up with coal & meet us at Potsdam in a few days. We are now (6 pm) passing through Dallman Hafen & expect to reach Eitape before daylight.While at anchor in Potsdam last night we found a fly in the soup. It happened thus : The number of soldiers aboard the Gabriel is about 60. They were all asleep on the upper deck, the lower deck being set apart for the native crew. I have mentioned that she is top-heavy, & with the extra weight on the upper deck she became very tender. During the night she got a list to port & gradually canted more & more until at last there was a crash in the galley, crockery smashing up galore. The skipper was practically sleeping on his head; I was asleep on the bridge & brought up against binnacle; Capt Morrison found himself halfway through the taffrail, & some of the men found their hammocks swinging over the port bulwarks. The port boat was lowered & the cargo was shifted to starboard & she righted herself. The skipper has announced that the upper deck must be kept clear & that the men must keep below day & night. Verily a fly hath been found in the soup!When O! when, shall we find a craft worth the name?
