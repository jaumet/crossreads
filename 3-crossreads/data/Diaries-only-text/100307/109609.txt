Powdery snow falling before breakfast and the ground white. Rough on the people in the front line trenches particularly in the present pushing. Just at "fall in" a dense snow storm came on and it became quite dark. Parade postponed accordingly for half an hour. The sun then came out and the morning `was not unpleasant despite cold wind. A season of great contrasts is this. There are signs of much combing out in England as Kennedy has now joined up. Rumoured that HJ Smith is also under orders to rejoin. Tonight we have a concert and sports are also under weigh. Training this morning ? drill, general with artillery formations this afternoon. Worked out officers leave roster. How far down my own name now is! News of big stunts plenty of prisoners taken looks like the Big Push commencing. Roar of guns deep sounding at night ? we shall soon be in the merry game again. At 3 pm went down to Bde HQ and the CO. QM came also. Colonel Somerville
