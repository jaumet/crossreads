After lunch the Artillery car called for me and I met Colonel Cohen and went to Pont Noyelles where were the Colonel and officers of the 108 RFN whose evidence we proceeded to take as a Court of Inquiry.   Some of these chaps were very old gunners and had had much active service.   From here we drove to Dion to get our shorthand evidence typed and I had afternoon tea with General Phillips having some interesting talk.   The car then took us back through Querrieu where a big shell today accounted for 50 men of a Labour company killed and wounded.   Noticed a very fashionably dressed man with a tall and very chic lady.   These must have been Billjims dressed up I think.   Home through La Houssaye to Franvillers .   Many camouflaged dumps of shells en route here and some big guns emplaced.   Had Mess and then did some writing.   Went down to the Battalion office and fixed up a number of matters there.   It was a quiet evening on the front.   100 of my men were away digging.   Word came back of a German wireless intercepted which said our front line would be strafed between 3 and 5 am.   Posted extra sentries and put an extra officer on duty.
