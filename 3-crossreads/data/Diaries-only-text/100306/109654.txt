B Camp 11/1/17 Had a cup of soup with Padre Durnford and after seeing Plant returned to Camp once more. Wrote out the necessary orders for tomorrows move. Snow in light powdery flakes and soon whitened the ground. The temperature is moderate ? not so cold as one might expect for snowfall. Our cook goes to hospital today with a perianal abscess. He is always in trouble ? suffers much from bad feet and physical weakness and lost by death his father wife and two children. Seeking consolation of a little French m'selle to whose mother he paid a franc as the price of her seduction, he caught the clap and consequently misses his English leave.! His cup is indeed full. Today he complained to the M.O. of a sore "prostrate"! In his place we are getting another cook who is a good man but just recovering from a love malady he caught at Armentieres. Our venereal friends!!. Stewart went to Albert today to return pay and to get our regimental funds squared. The men are busy doing "tasks", putting in tank guns among other things and do their 6 hours work per diem. These huts are good and warm and very homelike after
