<p>1918<br/>Sun 24th Feb.<br/>Our best meal for many months was at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Beef (yes, Beef!), beetroot, potatoes, and coffee ersatz (that word Ersatz (substitute) was to become well-know to us).</p>
<p>We gorged till we could gorge no more, and then the hungry German sentries came in and devoured the scraps.</p>
<p>Tue. 26th.<br/>Yesterday a procession of doctors dug around all over me, consulted my Doc's report, &amp; mumbled "operation".    Today I moved to the hospital proper.</p>
<p>The hospital is the Festungs-lazarelt, Kiel-Wik, &amp; consists of about 10 separate buildings, each complete and detached, yet all connected up by underground tunnels.</p>
<p>I am in Haus B, ward 25.</p>
<p>The wards are small, comfortable, &amp; beautifully lighted &ndash; a row of big windows stretching right across one wall.</p>
