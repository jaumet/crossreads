waterwheel. At 3o'c inspected the men and horses of the Regimental transport and got a good turnout. The horses are looking well in spite of a reduced ration and our painters were at work on the limbers. In the transports we have a number of elderly men and they are a very happy family. Mostly country chaps they are great stay at homes and amuse themselves in their own little circle. Knowing that they are on a good job they look to their behaviour and we get no orderly room cases from them. After mess held a conference of my O.C. Coys Dooley Kennedy Fulton Mackinnon and discussed generalities. At mess we drank the King and the dinner was excellent. Old Habel Cutler are a good pair.
