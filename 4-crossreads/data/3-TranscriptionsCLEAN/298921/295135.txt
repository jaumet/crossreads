  
 June, 1915 Sunday 13 Returned from Alex:- It is full of French soldiers Blue shirts Red Pants & like a Circus all colored horses. The streets were crowded with Lorrys made out of London Buses! to carry 30 & every hotel full of officers - The bay full of ships & every wharf crowded with Bully Beef & Biscuits 320 casualties out of 1st L.H.B. to date. I expect letters today & will then post.
