 Dear Mother 
 I have just received a large &amp; interesting mail from Australia, seven altogether &amp; a bosca big parcel from Mrs West or St. James Red Cross.  The letters were No. 15 &amp; two (No. 16) sixteens from you, a very nice one from Dora and from Bob Ingram, Aunt Jean &amp; Jean.  We may get some more yet.  Last week I got one from Woody which came through Aunt Greta &amp; therefore got here a few days earlier.  With it came a parcel of a muffler, pair of socks &amp; mittens from Rene.  This is the biggest wait for mail we have had yet, three weeks since the last &amp; only a couple came then so there it is quite 6 weeks since the last good mail.  I suppose the delay was caused by the strike but one does not mind waiting so long as they turn up in the end.
