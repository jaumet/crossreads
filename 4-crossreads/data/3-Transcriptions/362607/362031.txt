<p>17.3.18<br/>Bulford<br/>Dear George,<br/>I have no news to give you at all. This is just a view of old England in Summer Time. It is all bare now but in a month's time all the trees will be in bloom like those in the Picture. It has been hot today &amp; now it is quite cool. In the morning it will be almost freezing. I have been very tired this week on account of having to run a Dance as well as my own work. Mt Office Staff have got to be watched or the whole business will get in a tangle. We are short of staff again &amp; it is hard to run a show when about 6 or 7 men are short. I had a letter from Reg Kierle yesterday. He is tip-top again. The Office cat is sleeping in a box under one of the office tables. He's been out on the loose. We expect an increase of about a dozen. I have not done any cycling lately. I strained my leg playing Hockey. I had to take a bit of a rest. Well I must scribble a line to Dad &amp; write to Jennie &amp; Marie to-night, so wish the Boys health &amp; happiness to all &amp; [indecipherable] Friends. Kindest Regards  Love Harry</p>
