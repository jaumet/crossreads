<p>28th. In the billet where we are resting there are hundreds of bird nests mostly sparrows of course, you should hear them twittering in the early morning, you should see them up by the firing line, they are nesting all over the old ruins of the buildings, regardless of the noise of the guns all round them. they have come to regard it I think as an unusually long thunderstorm, they are another example of the phrophesing experts connected with this war, for I read on several occasions where these knowalls predicted that all the birds would clear out of France, how they are mistaken for that part of France swarms with bird especially larks, its lovely of an early morning to hear them singing</p>
