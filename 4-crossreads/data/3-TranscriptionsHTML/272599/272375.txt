<p>1917 Saturday 14 April</p>
<p>Sanitation duties today.<br/>The 3rd Field are terrors for work we have breakfast immediately after parade, then to work at 8 a.m. till 12 noon. 1.00 pm to 4 &amp; often after tea more jobs.<br/>Tucker is very scarce too the difficulty of getting up sufficient supplies from Albert being the cause.   Bully &amp; biscuits our main stay when everything else fails.<br/>Fritz has an immense cemetry up in the village.   Hundreds being buried there.   He keeps the graves very nicely &amp; each has a large wooden cross, with name, age etc fully printed thereon.   Two graves of "Englanders" well kept too one with 2 wreathes on it.</p>
