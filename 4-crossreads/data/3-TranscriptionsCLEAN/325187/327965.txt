Not so good last night but Sisters gave me a sleeping TOT & put me in a fresh Bed & I soon went off-  This is a big ward & now holds 30 officers   People have brought Flowers & are very good.News in the Paper is good everything is going right & I feel we have won at last, only a matter of time now.The papers now give the ANZACS credit for the recent fight-  We the LH ANZACS did it helped by the Artillery of course.Several officers are insensible all night you can hear them rambling about Mother [indecipherable]
