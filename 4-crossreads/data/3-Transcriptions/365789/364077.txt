<p>G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., C.S.I., and to the Government of Egypt, I owe a deep debt of gratitude for whole-hearted co-operation and help.</p>
<p>I am very greatly indebted to Vice-Admiral Sir R. E. Wemyss, K.C.B., C.M.G., M.V.O., and the naval forces under his command, for constant assistance and active co-operation.</p>
<p>The construction of roads, waterworks, and kindred tasks in connexion with the Canal defences, which I have described to you, owe their accomplishment in a very large measure to the admirable services of Colonel Sir Murdoch Macdonald, K.C.M.G., of the Public Works Department of Egypt.  His wide experience and capacity have been an indispensable asset to me in dealing with these important problems.</p>
<p>I am particularly indebted to the Railway Department, under Colonel Sir George Macauley, K.C.M.G., R. of O., Royal Engineers, for the highly successful manner in which railway communication has been carried on under great difficulties.  The movement of a large number of troops and impedimenta of an army has severely taxed the capacity of the railway, and has put a great strain on its staff.  That it never failed to accomplish what was desired is due to the high efficiency this Department has attained, and to the personal exertions of Colonel Sir George Macauley.</p>
<p>I wish to bring to your notice the very responsible and important duties that have fallen to my Director of Army Signals, Brigadier-General M. G. E. Bowman-Manifold, D.S.O., R.E., and to the admirable way in which he has discharged them.</p>
<p>Military operations on the two fronts have been spread over a very wide front, amounting to close on 1,000 miles in the west and 90 miles in the east.  Prompt and reliable inter-communication has been a matter of vital importance.</p>
<p>In the successful achievement of this, I beg also to bring to your notice the services of the Egyptian Telegraph Department, under Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Liddell, D.S.O., Royal Engineers, and to express my thanks to the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Telephone Company of Egypt, who have given my Director of Army Signals unceasing valuable help.</p>
<p>I beg to bring to notice the valuable services rendered to the Canal defences by the representative and principal officer of the Suez Canal Company, Charles Comte de Serionne, Agent Superieur de la Compagnie du Canal de Suez, and by the staff of that company.</p>
<p>The arduous and important work of the care of the sick and wounded in the hospitals has been considerably lightened by a large amount of voluntary aid.  I wish specially to mention the work of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St John of Jerusalem, Under Sir Courtauld Thomson, C.B.</p>
<p>The nursing services, both English and Australian, have done admirable work, and the voluntary aid of the Sisters of Notre Dame de la Delivrance, working at the Austrian Hospital at Alexandria, have been specially brought to my notice.</p>
<p>I have other names to bring to notice for distinguished and gallant service during the operations under review, and these will form the subject of a separate communication.</p>
<p>I have the honour to be, Sir,<br/>Your most obedient servant,<br/>A.J. Murray, General,<br/>Commander-in-Chief,<br/>Egyptian Expeditionary Force</p>
