<p>25/12/17 Xmas Day Kortepyp. Belgium.<br/>150 men left early on working parties round the reserve lines. The day early was dull but fine. At 9.30 all men left in camp fell in and marched to church parade in the Church Army hut. The Band (which had played carols at reveille) marched us back to camp. At lunch a little snow fell but the outlook cleared until the middle afternoon when a heavy driving snowstorm sprang up &ndash; a remarkable sight. The snow continued intermittently after that &amp; darkness fell on the growing whiteness of snow drift. The men for tea had soup, fish, roast rabbit &amp; beef stuffed &amp; plenty of vegetables, plum pudding with rum sauce, plenty of cigarettes and a Xmas parcel each from the Comforts fund. Also issued a Battalion Xmas Card to each chap. The cooks did good work &amp; everyone enjoyed their dinner. Saw a cook thawing a boxful of rabbits tonight. Henry Crowther rang up and we swopped greetings.</p>
