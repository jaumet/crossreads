 the cable catches the wire by which it is moored & then it is secured. They were not long at the job when they signalled that all was clear. Then the Encounter, passing thro' a channel in the reef, slowly and carefully made her way inside. We could watch her masts over the promontory. Then the Berrima followed & for a few hours we lost sight of them. We remained outside, lying about a mile off shore. They must have done jolly good work, for they signalled they wd. be ready for sea by five p.m. We had hardly expected to get away that day. There was no opposition and the landing was unexpectedly easy; not many Germans were there, and as they had no chance of success, wisely gave in. All the same, had they been minded to resist, they could quite easily have wiped out the picket boats crews at least. Had a machine gun implanted at the entrance among the palm trees, not a man cd. have escaped. It wd. of course have been very bad for the Germans afterwards, &  that is I suppose what made them lie low. We had a quite uneventful journey back to Rabaul where we arrived on Sat Sept 26. Now I am making a mistake, for there  was  an incident. It was on Thursday night in the middle watch when Eumann was C.O.W. otherwise officer of the watch. He saw lights ahead and wasn't there a flap. "Man and arm ship" the bugle sounded. The ship was thoro'ly roused. Mo. Rob came & woke me up saying, "Come on Padre, lights ahead, we're in for it". I hope I wasn't rude but I was very sleepy. I can remember saying "If there are lights, there is no enemy. Go to bed". And with that turned over to sleep and dream. Mo. stayed  up all night. But they were only natives fishing boats burning flares. We had to chaff Eumann about it, tho' he had only done what he had to do. As soon as we got back to Rabaul on Sat, the collier came alongside and we took in about 1000 tons.
