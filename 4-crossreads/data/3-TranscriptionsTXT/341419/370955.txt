 Port Melbourne, 24th Dec. 10 p.m. We had a very anxious time today until Lunch time when the Ship was pronounced clean &amp; was cleared. 
 We arrived at Port Melbourne at about 5 p.m. &amp; the Victorians Disembarked into motor cars &amp; departed amidst much merriment.  There was a band &amp; a Naval guard of honour.  It was quite a funny sight.  Later on the whole of the Ship was given leave.  I did not go as we disembark tomorrow &amp; spend the night in the train &amp; so I don't consider that it is worth while dissipating tonight.  However I took a walk onto the base of the quay &amp; was talking to the Naval guard
