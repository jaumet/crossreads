 My Dear Judge 
 I have just received the news that Arthur has been killed. It is useless for me to try to express my sympathy you know just how I feel for you all. Poor Mrs Ferguson I hope she is strong enough to bear it as bravely as the rest of our wonderful women seem to at home. 
 I am as well as ever, and am enjoying myself in between   [indecipherable] very well. The French people are wonderful. They are perfectly happy in all their troubles & their hospitality is immense. 
 It is great to be mixed up in a stunt like this and to see the way all the wheels work. The amount of movement is more than you can imagine and everything seems to go like clockwork 
 We are constantly on the move from Billet to Billet to   [indecipherable] &  back
