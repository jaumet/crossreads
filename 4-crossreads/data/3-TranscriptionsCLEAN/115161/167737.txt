 Thus ended my military career. 
 For four and a half years I had worn khaki, and my life during the greater portion of that time had been spent amongst men, - men who have won the respect and admiration of the whole world, - men with whom it was an honor to be associated, - men to whom cowardice was a stranger, cruelty foreign and to whom fear was unknown.

 May he ever enjoy what he fought for, - right - freedom - and liberty. 
 May good health - good luck - and prosperity, attend him and his.
