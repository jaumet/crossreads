<p>Fine but cloudy. Lord only knows when we will see the sun again, &amp; we do miss it so, more than anything else in this country I think. Loading ashes all day &amp; bringing them round to the stables. Got two old letters from Linda, &amp; one from father &amp; one from Marj. They tell me I am to be a driver, but bye the Lord I am bucking against that.</p>
