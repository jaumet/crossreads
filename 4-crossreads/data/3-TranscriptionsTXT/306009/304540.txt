 1915 Dec. 24 Fri. Christmas Eve &ndash; Spent the afternoon decorating the Colonel's office &ndash; it looks very smart! Went into Cairo about 5.30 p.m. &amp; about half an hour later rain began to fall &ndash; third time since I came to Cairo. Went to Shepheards' where a Belgian Fete was being held, but arrived too late &amp; found all over Town full of Troops (notwithstanding rain) &amp; some the worse for booze. Rendered first aid to an unconscious chap who had evidently been drugged with native liquor &amp; then handed him over to the Mil. Police. Went back to Gezira acting as escort to English lady who appeared to be a trifle afraid of natives &amp; "excited" soldiers.
