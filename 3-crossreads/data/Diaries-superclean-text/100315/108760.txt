7/4/18 ? Albert-Dernacourt Line
Our people here held the Railway until a few days ago but were pushed back. Out in front of the posts there are many dead. The Huns have been ratting the canteens captured from us. Everyone speaks contemptuously of the Tommies and the way they cleared out in panic from the Boche. There must be many deserters and looting of French villages and drunkenness are rife. So much for the vaunted discipline of the British Army! Our chaps are wonderful and set an example of courage and determination. Everywhere they are enthusiastically hailed by the French inhabitants as the saviours of their country.
