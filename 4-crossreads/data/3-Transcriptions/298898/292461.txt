<p>headquarters etc. all connected up. Had a good look at Flers which was being shelled &amp; the day being fine had a good look at Bapaume a goal of long standing. Shelling was going on all the line both shrapnel &amp; heavy stuff. Great improvements had been made since my last trip, light railways being everywhere &amp; of great value the wounded being sent down by rail saving a very long carry. Had a couple of taubes over during the afternoon but our Chaps seemed to take but little notice of them. Roy C. turned up during the day having come to the 15th a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>Friday 2nd March 1917<br/>Things very quiet altho' indications of a busy time coming. Had several Huns through today, Bavarians &amp; more to come. Weather on the cool side but dry.</p>
