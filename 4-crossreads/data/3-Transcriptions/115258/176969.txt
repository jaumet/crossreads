<p>This may give you some idea of it. You see the wadi is like the deep cutting with great high banks but they keep the water about fifty or a hundred feet above these banks again by cutting drains round the mountains and following the spurs and gullies round. It takes miles and miles of drains but they are able to make it run a good way.</p>
