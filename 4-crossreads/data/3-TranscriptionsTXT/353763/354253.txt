To the Beach in the aftn  -  with liberty men from H.M.A. Submarine AE2 - a great boon to the submarine men  -  They alone of all the fleet allowed on shore  -  They deserved the boon anyway  -  First of all I did a little laundry job - ship prices 4/ a dozen - each piece 4d - therefore a pair of socks 8d !!! Pay don't run to that so I fixed up with a Chinese man my small goods & left the large for the ship's chap - wily white man = Then I blew in at the Carnegie library & inquired about a Flora Vitiensis - Fiji or Viti - Seeman wrote one in 1869 - that's the standard one & I spent an hour examining his colored plates - beautifully done  -  A palm peculiar to Fiji bore the palm Pritchardia pacifica  -  There was also a volume entitled 'The cruise of the Curacoa' before his time (Seeman's) & it figured Flora & Fauna of varied species right thro the Pacific Islands  -  There is no naturalist in Suva I regret to say & of course on the shore
