Having arrived safely at the sap we all felt exceedingly thankful. Somehow I felt very weak in the knees and found difficulty in getting along. Sgt. Davison who was leading the way, commenced to roil about in an uncontrollable manner, and at length broke into a frantic rush, cursing and swearing at the Huns. He was apparently suffering from over strain, and the part of the trench from which we had on the way up thrown out one of our own men just killed, started Davison on his headlong career. He at length fell exhausted in the trench, and recovered sufficiently to be able to walk. His memory had gone, and we had difficulty in getting him along. He recognised me and said Is that you Capt. Fox. I will follow you to death, no one ever yet found Davison a coward". We at length arrived at the junction of the trench and the road, where Davison would persist in sitting down and talking to a man who apparently just died on a stretcher.We here found an infantry man who had lost his way and was demented. We brought him along with us. Davison again started a charge all on his own, charging down the road at full speed, fortunately in the right direction. He came acRoss some Tommy machine gunners whom he started to lash into, fortunately he was unarmed.When the others came up he set upon them as well, and gave one man a vigorous smack in the mouth. I rode ahead on a bicycle and obtained an ambulance wagon to take us all home to the billet. We were all considerably shaken and heartily glad to get back. Davison's memory improved and he asked after Mr Pinder and party.
15th General NAIRNE sent for me, as he was anxious to know how we got on. I did not feel at all well, but shaken up from the day previous. The General was very kind and thoughtful and expressed satisfaction at what had been done. I asked that Sgt. Davison's work receive recognition. I returned to the billet and rested and went to bed early. I learnt that the attack which took place the previous night had failed, owing to the fact that the Germans attacked at the same time. The bombardment which was taking place while we were firing the gun was their preliminary to an attack.
