26  Another "cradle" night, & it was cool too. Plenty of large rats on board. One of them went prospecting in Dad Drury's bag in search of concealed chocolates. No posting on todays Chart, as the 2nd mate has gone crook on us. Gee! You should have been to the Concert tonight. The 2 crookest items were by the heads, & most of the others were so so but all the same I never laughed so much before Unluckily Tom Tit (the Col) & Whistling Rufus (S. Surgeon)
