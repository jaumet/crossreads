<p>towards the end of t his cruel war.</p>
<p>I have had several letters from my pals, in the 5th Div.   &amp;  they had come though safely. None from the boys of 1st   &amp;  2nd Div.. they did wonderfully well but am afraid a number have been killed   &amp;  wounded. Though there has been very few casualties.</p>
<p>I think I told I had a field P.Card from Charlie   &amp;  a letter now.</p>
