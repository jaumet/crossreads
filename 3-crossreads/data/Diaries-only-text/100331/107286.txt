Monday 12th
was very low as it was very foggy, it was hard to see them, when I got line clear I came away to Reigersberg Nth put my two trucks into a Siding picked up my Troop Train when it was loaded away I went at 7.15am up to St Jean put some Men out further along I went put out some more, when the alarm again was sounded up in the Air I could see 5 Taubes hovering about. I did not move my train as it is harder to hit a Standing Train, Men were running for shelter along the main Road a number of Motor Transports halted, I could hear Bombs exploding away in the Fog. The Taubes soon were hunted away by our Machines I then proceeded up to Wieltje Sidi Station detrained the balance of the troops then came back to St Jean Yard was releived at 8.15 am walked back to our Vans had breakfast turned in, as I was very tired, being up since 7 am the previous day.
