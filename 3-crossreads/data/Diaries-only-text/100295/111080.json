named Joyce, from Rushcutters Bay Sydney, to Westhoek. It was very quiet there was no great artillery activity. I noticed all the artillery is ready for another "stunt" they are all registered have great supplies of ammunition on hand. I am getting to know the areas where the Boche are most likely to shell avoid them. It was Joyce's first day on the battlefield his comments dodging when shells came over rather tickled me. I have become a fatalist. I took over 400 feet Cine film of glimpses on the Menin Road. The effects being extremely fine on account of the frightful dust. We appear on the eve of another battle the roads on the way home were just streams of men transports.
