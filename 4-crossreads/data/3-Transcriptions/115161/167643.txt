<p>It is about 9.30 when we are in readiness to again be on the move, so after the roll call and other procedures are gone through, the order is given &quot;form fours&quot;, &quot;quick march&quot;, and we are off again on our way to go through some more experiences.&nbsp; Pass through once more the now well-known village - Vauxl -, on over the same ground which holds such sad memories, through the sunken road where I first became acquainted with &quot;Horatio&quot;, and back to the trenches which a week or so ago we had fought for and won at such a terrible cost.</p>
