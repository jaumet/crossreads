<p>Dear Sec.<br/>I received a parcel which you had been good enough to send along to my troop containing 24 shirts, they could not possibly have reach us in a better time, or place, as most of the men were badly in need of shirts, as where we are it so very difficult to purchase them.</p>
<p>We are having a very easy time just at present, though the conditions which we live under are not the best.</p>
<p>Your truly<br/>G.A. Guthrie. Lieut.<br/>D Troop<br/>B Squad.<br/>1st A.L.H. Reg.</p>
