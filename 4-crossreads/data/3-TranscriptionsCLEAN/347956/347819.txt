cold & wet when revallie went this morning & was not feeling too frisky.  was exercising horses all the morning was feeling rotten at dinner time & went to sleep shortly after with pains in my chest, am afraid I am in for plueresy.Paraded sick after stables & Dr Iodine prescribed 3 tablets & advised me not to eat meat or drink cocoa & to end up he said: - in fact I don't think you can get anything here except tea & bread & it is a fact, we have bully-beef & bread seems to be all that is issued;
one of the mares dropped a foal here & it is being made a pet of;I had a piece of biscuit & a drop of tea about sundown & turned in to bed.  anyone could get leave that wants it & can go to Cairo;  Nelson has gone.  a canteen is on the ground & eggs & steak with a cup of coffee costs 9d but we are only allowed to draw
