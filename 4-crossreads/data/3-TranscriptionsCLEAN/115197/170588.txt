An excellent play with a weak cast and some faulty production.  Stage too small for spectacular effects - Amateur acting - a great last act.
April 16th
Parcels - Letters - Diary - Kings Cross - Drury Lane - "Samson & Delilah".  An Australian in the audience.  A hurried departure, and a night in the corridor
(Edna Thornton, Frederick Blaney)
