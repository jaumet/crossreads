<p>OCTOBER &nbsp; TUESDAY 3 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Raining most of the day. Out with the signallers all day. The battery was on duty. I heard that I was recommended for a commission with Poss Nivison &amp; I dont want the bally star, but I think that its up to me to take it if it comes my way. My idea was to go through this war in the ranks with the men &amp; to get to know them all personally as it may come in very handy in after life. I have refused stripes a couple of times for that reason. Anyway its not official yet, so why worry over it. Got a letter from Linda 20/8/16.</p>
