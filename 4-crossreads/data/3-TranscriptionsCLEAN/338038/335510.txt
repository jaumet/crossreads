 91 North Rd Five Dock 8.8.18 
 Dear Mr Garling Yours of 6th .8.18 to hand.  I am very pleased to state that under my treatment I have improved wonderfully.  So much so that I am looking for an entry into civil life again. First I must explain I am still in the forces & under treatment yet I am like the Scot looking for a new job before I lose the old. I will give you an account as near as possible the battles my late O.C. commanded the battery in. He joined the battery in a position behind "Flers" relieving Capt Shepherd.  We then moved to a place in front of "High Wood" & whilst there the battery along with others was mentioned by General Monash ?  for supporting the 13th Btn in an attack on "stormy trench".
