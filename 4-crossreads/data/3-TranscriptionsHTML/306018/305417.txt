<p>April 1917<br/>Wednesday 11th<br/>The Brigade got back into camp at 3 pm &amp; we soon got the dust off us by a plunge into the sea.  Sharks have been seen &amp; police patrol the beach  Got news of a big British success in France.  An Australian mail also arrived  I got 3 letters dated 25th Febry.  Posted letters to Doug &amp; Roy</p>
<p>Thursday 12th<br/>We got a lecture on the use of gas helmets &amp; it was very interesting  We will have to get a fair bit of drills to make us quick at using them  A Turkish aeroplane dropped a few bombs near the aerodrome, but came under heavy shell fire &amp; nearly got hit  They are getting a great respect for our anti guns &amp; fly at a great height.  Heard that the Scotties captured a Turkish outpost &amp; some machine guns also that a German spy had been captured in our lines dressed as an Australian officer.  He was inspecting gun positions.  Our Brigade brought in 2 Turks &amp; 2 Bedouins today  A watch from home arrived by packet registered post.</p>
<p>Friday 13th<br/>Our guns were more active today.  There was plenty of aerial activity</p>
