 Very Cool - a Bit Rough. It was so quiet you would never dream that over 1500 men are on board. A passing Cruiser at night honoured us with her flashlights. Very pretty looking over the railing at phosphorous - in great quantitys tonight. I notice a lot of stars that I have never seen before & much more brilliant than most of ours. The Southern Cross has disappeared to view.

 Rather warm - a lot calmer - Passed several large Boats. Passed Socotra Islands in the forenoon - Very high & barren. I don't think they are inhabited.
