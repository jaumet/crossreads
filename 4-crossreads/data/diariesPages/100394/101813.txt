I was swimming and sitting on the banks of Lake Timsah alternately most of the morning. Bob and I went over and saw the boys in the 15th Fld. Amb for a while tonight. When I came back I got orders to report to 51st Battery tomorrow. I was given a choice of 4 batteries and accepted this one. all those who were on Anzac had their names taken today for bars. Red and blue for those who were in the

landing and plain blue for those who arrived after. Anzac Day (25th) is a holiday and we are holding sports. The Prince of Wales and all his entourage were round again this morning. I reported to my Battery this afternoon and will start tomorrow. I am in a tent with Bombardier Dunn (a friend of Bobs) a very nice chap out of C.S.R. I am pretty nervous for a start but I daresay I will get along alright after a time. Got 2 champions and a Sunday times a few days ago.

Started in battery this morning. Squad drill for 1 ½ hours before breakfast. Fill in again at 8.30 and got orders to fall out with specialists. I am on the range finding and observing staff and as far as I can see I am going to have an easy time of it. This afternoon I got orders from the Adjutant to report back to the M.O. who arrived this morning and help him ‘til another Corporal arrived. I was very disappointed as I am very keen and every day lost makes it harder for me to make up.

Have been trying to get a dispensary going today and also working my head to get a Corporal in quickly. My officers are O.K. Lieut Prior in charge and Lieut Cullen (second in charge) All the officers in this Brigade are good. Capt Wilkinson is the new M.O. an awfully nice chap Tomorrow is Good Friday and a holiday. I daresay there will be another full dress parade for the Prince of Wales or some such celebrity. It is an awful farce in my opinion. Had a swim in the Canal this morning.
