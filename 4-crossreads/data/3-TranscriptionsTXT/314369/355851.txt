Put in part of the day in going along our firing line   &  having a look at the dead Turks who are lying in heaps in front of our trenches
Heavy thunder storm overtakes us while returning from a sapping job at 8.30 pm   &  wets us   &  our camp while we are away
1915 July 1Thursday
Sun shines brightly again this morning   &  the wet is soon forgotten
Six men wounded while getting water this morning by shrapnell
Sapping again 4 to 8 pm
