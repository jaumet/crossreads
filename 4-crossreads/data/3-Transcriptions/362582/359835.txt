<p>2<br/>building huts for us and have the Electric Light in our Mess Tent. Our Ward Tents are much better arranged &amp; the patients are very contented &amp; happy. I'm very well &amp; got my voice back again. had three days off &amp; put on Wine (Port) also a Tonic, so feeling very fit. We are able to get a little time off-duty each day lately, so that is a grand thing for us. I believe Fred has got his leave at last &amp; gone to Blighty, he will be disappointed at his wife having to remain in America, especially after waiting so long to be able to meet her. it is very hard on the married men, in fact all the men to be so long away from their homes. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all &amp; heaps of luck for the next year. From, yours lovingly, Edith.</p>
