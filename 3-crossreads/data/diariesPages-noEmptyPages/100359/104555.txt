This morning we had a steak for breakfast. At least that is what the cooks called it, and as there was not sufficient to say what it was by taste, we shall have to let it go that we did really have steak for breakfast. Of course we all growled about it, and some of the growls reached the ears of the Orderly Officer who came around to see what was the cause of all the growling, but with the "real thorough-ness" which is peculiar to the "British Army Officer, instead of getting at the seat of the trouble, and letting the owners of the "aforesaid, steak explain things, he inclined his ear to our very able acting Q.M. who propounded a very interesting story, and our gallant orderly officer, went away quite satisfied that the privates would growl even if they had a menu to chose from like patrons of the "Hotel Cecil". This morning I printed a couple of pictures with Payne's outfit. These are the last I'll get as all cameras are called in. "Lizzie" Payne and "Her" partner Miles Sheehan are jolly good camera friends "(I don't think) Miles took Paynes picture, Payne printed a copy this morning and he calls it "The Prince of Wales in Egypt."

More kit inspection we had to give one of our Blankets in to.day so let us hope it wont be cold tonight. Peter came in to see me and we had a good old yarn, Our Incinerator is kept going merrily burning old clothes. We gave the Helmets in and got our felt hats back.

Posted letter No.3 to Lill. I wonder when we shall be able to write again. Soon I hope. Short arm and foot inspection. They took more clothes away from this morning, so now all we have left is what we stand up in. The tents are coming down tomorrow. We are living closer to nature every day.
