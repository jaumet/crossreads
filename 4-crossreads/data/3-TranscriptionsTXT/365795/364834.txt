 A Postscript Tristram James, as this biographical sketch has shown, did not reach Shakespeare's seventh age of man. But the last stage in his official life was reached 50 years and two months after his death. Then, on or about 15 November 1989, the Australian War Graves Service placed a commerative plaque on Wall 27 in Row S in the South Australian Garden of Remembrance11. Its purpose was to commemorate LIEUTENANT-COLONEL TRISTRAM BERNARD WORDSWORTH JAMES, DSO (1883-1939) who was, in the War of 1914-18, a Commanding Officer of the 7th Brigade, A.F.A. of the 3rd Australian Division and who, today, has no known grave.
