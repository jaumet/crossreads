Sunday 13 May 1917.
My 20th birthday. Woke up seasick at 6 am. A cold wind blowing.
Hail & rain storms at intervals.
Everything bleak & desolate. Nothing in sight but water everywhere.
Boat shipping seas. Very rough weather but boat is riding well. Hope I never spend another birthday like this one. Could not stand down below so had to stay above deck.
Everybody crook with one or two exceptions. Waves bigger than I've ever seen before.
Turned in early as I felt very crook.
We have after leaving "the heads" come well down south off Tas. west coast.
Geo. C. looked after me. He was not sea-sick.
