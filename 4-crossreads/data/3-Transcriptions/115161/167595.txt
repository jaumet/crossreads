<p>and asked the officer if he could direct him to his battalion, the officer replied that he was not quite sure, but thought he had better continue on the way he was travelling, for &quot;if you don&#39;t find you battalion, old chap, you will do us a good turn by diverting the attention of the &quot;snipers&quot; from us&quot;. I have often wondered how that chap got on and if he ever found his battalion.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was ever the same, whenever you returned from &quot;leave&quot; it was a case of travel all over the place looking for your unit. No one ever knew just where they were situated, but they nearly always seemed to be &quot;in the line&quot;. then you had to &quot;run the gauntlet&quot; to find them, same as instanced above.</p>

In reply to his question as to my special ailment, I said, &quot;I think my throat is sore, sir&quot;. &quot;But surely you know if your throat is sore or not, don&#39;t you?&quot; I replied, &quot;No sir!&nbsp;I am not</p>
