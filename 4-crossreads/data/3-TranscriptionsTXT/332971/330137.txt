You'll understand now why my promise to you all cannot be kept until I feel free to send it.  We reached Fremantle at 10 a.m. on Monday morning - a glorious day - I was met by my sister's little Isobel and Jack also Miss Noar & little Esmond Hart. We then hurried to my sister's home at Mt. Lawley where she had invited my W.A. friends to have lunch with me. I enjoyed every minute of the time to the full but it was all too short as we were sailing again at 3 p.m. but how happy I was to feel that the old friends of many years were just the same. There was Mr and Mrs Uren whom I knew in S.A. and had often made their home at my home. There was Millie Butcher - my very oldest girlfriend &  her 3 children.  Gertie Wren & her 2 children. Miss Butcher, Miss Hicks & her little charges.  My sister in law From S.A. Mrs Coombs & dear old Hedgie - who rushed in like a whirlwind of love with the loveliest bunch of roses & Carnations. Mr and Mrs [indecipherable]
