<p>December  1918.<br/>Friday 20</p>
<p>At Sea. H.S."Karoola."<br/>Weather very wet but brighter in the afternoon.<br/>Commenced a long letter home which I'm hoping will arrive before I do.<br/>"She" did her 347 miles today which means that we have now 1092  miles to go before we reach Port Said.<br/>I suppose we shall have Xmas Day in or not far from Suez. Played Auction until I felt too bad to do so. Had a relapse of fever which I quite expected.</p>
