 1917 MARCH 
 19 MONDAY 
 A cold rainy day &amp; blowing very 
 hard, especially towards 
 evening. Cleaning harness 
 ect all day. I went up 
 to the horse spraying place 
 at Armenti&egrave;res with a couple 
 of mangy horses to get them 
 sprayed. Heard of Jack 
 Walsh&#39;s death. Fritz scored 
 a direct hit on a Stokes 
 gun that he was working.
