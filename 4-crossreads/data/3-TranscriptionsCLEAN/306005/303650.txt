I believe it was very amusing this morning an English Colonel came over with Cox & wanted 3 Sqdn of Light Horse to protect working parties in from of our lines.Cox blew him up properly & told him a Troop was quite sufficient; He then wanted to have our camp shifted as he said we interfered with the right flank of the 127th Bde & Cox told him to go to Jericho. 
 18-12-16 Mon 18th Jimmy Leask & I decided to go back on to the Coast & have a look at the old Roman ruins today & left here at 8 oclock, had a very interesting trip coming upon an old Bedouin fishing
