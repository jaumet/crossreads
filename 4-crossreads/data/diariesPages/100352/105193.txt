We went for a march to the same place as we went a week ago, so that there is nothing fresh to add.
Tonight there was some excitement. An alligator was sighted by "E" comp at supper time, out in mid-harbour, some extremely fine (?) shooting resulted.

A few dozen more of the same breed were to be seen floating round the wharf
