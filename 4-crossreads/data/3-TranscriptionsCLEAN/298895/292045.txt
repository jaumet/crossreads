  
 Wednesday 11th April Weather cold with plenty of snow.  Had our dinner & concert which had been postponed & which now turned out a huge success.  The Dinner was soup, meat & vegetables, fruit salad custard, pudding, with biscuits chocolates, nuts etc beer & cigars plenty of everything & the best feed I have seen in the army.  Then the concert went very well everyone being in good spirits, the Colonel was in the chair & did very well, altogether the celebration being a huge success.  General Howse  was round today & inspected the whole concern a job he does not waste time about as many do & seemed well satisfied Thursday 12th April. Everyone feeling heady today, not at all brisk.  An easy day at the baths so
