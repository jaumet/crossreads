 Absolutely a nightmare of a carry with everyone slipping &amp; cursing &amp; the patient groaning with pain.  Without exageration the mud is over my leggings.  This afternoon is fine &amp; enemy aeroplanes are very active.  Another carry at 7 pm. to night. Nov 3.  Move back to Longueval for a rest &amp; find the only accommodation taken &amp; we are left in the mud.  From the ridge behind Flers a good view of Baupume &amp; the road to Peronne is to be had.  Also the villages of Les Boeufs, Gaudecourt &amp; another.  Our position was just behind Gaudecourt.  Weather showery.  Examined a tank this morning. Nov 4th.  At Longueval on fatigue work at A.D.S. Nov 5th.  At Longueval.  This morning 1st &amp; 3rd Batts attacked the German positions   The latter were successful but the 1st had to retire with heavy loss.  Details are lacking.  Arthur Fleming was killed collecting &amp; on the road, about 50 yards away a shell burst in a lorry &amp; unfortunately North was amongst the killed, Briggs, Tweddel (?) &amp; Wetzel were wounded, the second very badly. Nov. 6th  Still raining.  This afternoon we among others were sent up the line on fatigue carrying timber &amp; iron.  The work had to be done at night with the result when the material was deposited at its destination we were mud from head to foot.  The whole thing was a great example of gros incompetence which is rife among N.C.Os &amp; officers generally. Nov 7th  Still raining more mud &amp; slush   While on duty last night I saw a most wonderful allumination of the whole western sky accompanied by great clouds of smoke &amp; low explosions.  At the same time search lights were searching the sky.  Aeroplanes were heard &amp; bombs were dropped at many places.  It is said that a big ammunition etc. dump was bombed by Zeppelins. Nov 8th.  Still raining but fine this afternoon. Nov 9th    At the line again to the left of our late position.  A few hundred yards past Flers &amp; within easy distance.
