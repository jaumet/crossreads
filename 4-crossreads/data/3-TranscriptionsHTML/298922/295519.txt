<p>Saturday 28 July 1917</p>
<p>In the Trenches again but at a new Post called Y Redoubt &ndash; this gives the Horses a rest after their past 3 weeks hard riding. I am thankful as I have a Septic Boil which crucifies my leg when I move &amp; means continuous foments daily. I suppose it's the Tucker.</p>
<p>Flies worse here but am glad to get off riding &ndash; while leg bad. The L.H. are a versatile crowd &ndash; can take their turn as Pioneers, Railway construction or Trench digging &ndash; etc:-</p>
<p>Comfort Fund sent the men tinned vegetables &amp; Tobacco much appreciated.</p>
