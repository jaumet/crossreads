the evening. Unaccustomed as I am to horse riding, this evening s excursion was filled with thrills and excitement. The moon was heavily overcast, so that there was practically no light from the heavens. The path was evidently only a goat track, and filled with pitfalls and traps every few yards. Still the horses did remarkably well, and my estimation of them rose enormously.  Even in daylight I should not have dreamt of riding this track, and yet the whole brigade passed along it without mishap. At 11 pm we were at the arranged position, and after tethering out the horses rolled ourselves up in our blankets. The night was bitterly cold, and we missed our "bivvies", orders having been given to travel light, so that every man rode with an absolute minimum of weight. W e arc to leave here at 3.30 am to attack Neby [Nebi] Musa
