 TUESDAY, JULY 29, 1919. 
 Fine. Went over early and down to 
 the O.S.S Co's wharf at Circular Quay 
 The Sonoma berthed about 10 oclock 
 and Alan got off soon after. We 
 all went to the Wentworth. Linda 
 came in to Lunch & all the Allisons. 
 Linda & I got home after. We came 
 in to dinner at Usher's and went 
 on to Harry Lauder. It was not 
 much of a show.
