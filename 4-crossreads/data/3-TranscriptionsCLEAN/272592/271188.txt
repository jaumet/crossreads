  
 little Belgian town waiting for deliverance from the German yoke 
 2nd.   8 hour day in Australia & I can picture the crowds going to the races & etc in our "Sunny land of the South while here we are cooped up in our muddy & cold trenches & rain is falling falling as if it means to flood us out, but never mind its not going to last for ever & theres a "silver lining to every cloud" 
 We got 32 reinforcements for the Coy. last night, & 3 of them were hit on the way to the trenches, for they were unlucky for a machine gun fight was in progress as they were coming up its a wonder more of them were not killed for they rake the tracks they have to come up
