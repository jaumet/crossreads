<p>19.9.16<br/>Tue 19th<br/>We heard today there there were only 1,000 Turks &amp; 40 machine guns at Bir-El-Mazar &amp; as soon as the fighting commenced the Turks commenced to retire to El Arish leaving only 150 men with machine guns to fight a rear guard action, the 2nd Brigade was depending on a Turkish Sergt who volunteered to lead them into the Camp but the Sergt took them the wrong way &amp; had them lost for some time &amp; it was late when they got into action, it is stated that an enquiry is to be held over the attack, the Camel Corps failing to get around the back of the Turks was the principal cause of the attack failing.   The Turks had no Artillery</p>
