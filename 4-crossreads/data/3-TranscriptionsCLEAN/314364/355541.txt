Then at 4 we went [indecipherable] the Q.M. store where I managed to get my Tunic changed for a new one. Also tried to get paid but failed. The Pay Sgt said I would get a Pay on the Boat.  I hope so as I'm broke & a man will want a few shilling, for the Return trip on the Boat. After Tea Sgt Cropley & I went into Weymouth. I met Bill Watson on the way in. He was at "Monte Video" waiting for a Boat. Sgt Cropley & I went to the Jubilee Hall. We paid 1/10 each for a seat but it was a poor show. After that we met Staff Murray & Guy from the Massage [indecipherable] & we all adjourned & had some light refreshment. Meat Pies, Cakes & quite decent tea. Then we walked home. The beds in no 9 Hut are "Down" Beds Down on the Floor. It was very hard after the Spring Beds we had been used to at Littlemore. Turned into my Blankets about 10.Another day nearer B.E.Tues. Feb.4The Serg came round & called us at 5. I was awake when he arrived, not having slept all night. Hopped out of my Blankets & had a wash. Breakfast was on when I returned to the Hut Beautiful Dry Hash. We fell in at 6.30 & were issued with Rations. A chap named Davis & I were told off to stand by the Kits & the remainder marched to Weymouth Station. At 7 a car arrived & took Davis & I &  the Kits to the station. We got there about 9. Went into a Cafe & had a cup of coffee, which warmed us up greatly. The Train left Weymouth  about 8. We changed at Yeovil & TauntonArrived Taunton about 11.10 & left about 1.15. Strolled down town with a number of others. Had a shave & a feed. Arrived Plymouth about 3.15.  It was pouring in rain, & no one was there to meet us or to tell us what to do. We floundered around for about an hour when a motor ferry arrived & at took away our Kits. We went down to the Rocks on the Car (Train) Saw the "N.Zealand" in Dry Dock. Also saw the "Lion" & "Tiger"
