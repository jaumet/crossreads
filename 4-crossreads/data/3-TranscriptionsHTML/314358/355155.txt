<p>Forward we go along the winding way of the road across a meadow-like [feat?] where there are buttercups like little suns and daisies like stars.</p>
<p>A narrow river of running water glistens through the green, twisting and turning many times in its onward course to the sea.</p>
<p>Its clear waters are hastily tumbling forward with just a murmur of merry and gentle laughter as though in sheer gladness that spring with her magic finger-tips has touched the world.</p>
<p>Now a subtle joy has come where the curse of outrageous winter was; and the little stream is full to overflowing with a flood of sparkling glee, speeding on flush with the meadow grass and flashing silver light from its ripples as it goes</p>
<p>The sunny buttercups and starry dasies listen</p>
