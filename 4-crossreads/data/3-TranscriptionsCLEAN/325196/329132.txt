 Capt Harris turned up at the camp this afternoon, also a big gun Egyptian paid the Colonel a visit, he had an Egyptian body guard with him. The natives are digging up old ground (black) & carting it on camels & donkeys to the banks of the Canal where it makes a rich bed to grow crops. The ground they are digging is over old tombs, & some rare, ancient souvenirs can be had for the picking up, coins that must be thousands of years old are quite common also old fashioned lamps made of earth (baked) mummies are also common; The Tommies attached to us are rather good company, & are having a very amusing argument on conscription tonight.
