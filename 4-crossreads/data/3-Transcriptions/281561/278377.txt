<p>this bitter weather, and the rations are very scanty. The enemy shelling was heavy today. Shall be relieved this evening.</p>
<p>8/3/17.<br/>Came right out to Bazentin last night. It was a very long drag and the mud is as bad as ever. After that 6 mile stunt we had a couple of hours rest and marched on to Mametz a few miles away.<br/>10/3/17.<br/>The last few days spent in business as usual. Arch Mclveen dropped in to see me. The sluices of Heaven have been opened again, and rain falls most of the time.</p>
