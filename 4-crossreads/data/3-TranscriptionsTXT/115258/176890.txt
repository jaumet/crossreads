They would still make good fighters, if they were winning, but jolly cruel ones, just like the old Israelites. We saw a sight to day which the old regiment has not seen for a very long time - a car load of nurses from the hospital at Jerusalem going for a Sunday drive down towards Hebron. My word we gave them a cheer as they went past. This is getting quite a civilised front now alright; and its some change after all the desert we have been through.
Next day  Some more mail has come in but no letters from home yet. They seem to have a new system of sorting the mails now, before we gre used to get qall over our mail in one big plomp, now we keep getting two or three letters a day until they all arrive. I believe it is to make transport more even or something, but it is annoying being kept waiting for your letters once you know a mail is really in. I will let this go now and write to Mother as soon as the home letters arrive. Heard in letters to day that Mother and Aunt Fan & Aunt Katie were all in Sydney. So glad to hear Mother is going about so much. Love to Mother & Hal & Fred. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson (over)
