<p>be fairly mobbed.<br/>The answer I "one"<br/>What is it? "Australia"!!<br/>Some of them say two Australia &amp; Tasmania.<br/>But that wont be taken unless there are some Tasmanians around.<br/>We have been a very happy family on board but it will be nice to get on land again and see a bit more of the world.<br/>They have never had service on board since we left; which I think is a pity. but it  however we will be able to have church parade again pretty soon now.<br/>My word you appreciate the home Sundays when you get away like this; you will hear real old bushies here say that; whom you would never think had had a home for years.<br/>I have managed to escape the mumps so far and am feeling jolly fit on the whole but for a few bru bumps which I have received through rolling out of my hammock two nights running. It is a most horrible shock to land wop on the floor when you are sound asleep especially when the hammock is hung from the roof.<br/>Think I will sleep on the floor in future; it is safer when a person is such a wriggler like me.<br/>Kind regards to Dick &amp; Miss Stirling.  Love to Boys.  If we don't get any worse time than we have had on board the "Awful troop ships" this is going to be a picnic.  Must stop now. Good bye Mother dear.  fro Your loving son Rob.</p>
