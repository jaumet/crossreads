 Thursday 2 August 1917 
 Slight Tonsilitis &amp; Bronchitis &amp; with Septic leg I may go Field Hospital for a few days &ndash; nothing serious only usual small worries. Brigadier inspected Horses &amp; told me "he was a bit of a crock himself" so the opinion was I was put on the Train at 4 o'clock &amp; sent to No. 14 Australian General Hospital Cairo . There is nothing much wrong only fed up with Boils &amp; Bronchitis etc.  so will stay in bed for a week or so.  
 Jim Ayre is in the same Hospital &amp; will soon be O.K. I won't be here more than a few days &amp; then will be sent to ALEXANDRIA.
