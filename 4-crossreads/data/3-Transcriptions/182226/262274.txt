<p>Thursday 9 September, 1915</p>
<p>Wrote to Mother, Ada &amp; Gibby.</p>
<p>Mac has been crook all day but thinks he is getting better.</p>
<p>Went down for water &amp; lay about the rest of the day in our dugout, which is a regular little home.</p>
<p>The Turkish guns have been very quiet lately. I think they must have been located. Only one of them has fired at all during the last few days.</p>
