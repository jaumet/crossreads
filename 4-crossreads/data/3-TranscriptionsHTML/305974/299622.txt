<p>19 Monday<br/>Drilling all day.  Rained during the afternoon.  Wrote letters to Doris home, &amp; Olive Turner, also sending some photos.  No 29 hut had their photo taken by Q.M. Sgt.  A few changes occured  in the hut.  News of a great victory pending for over a week for the Russians.</p>
<p>20 Tuesday<br/>No 1 Section detailed for fatigue, I fell into cleaning 3 stoves in the dyspensary.  No1 &amp; 2 section men examined to see if fit for a field ambulance or a hospital.  I managed to get into a field ambulance &amp; expect further arrangements at an early date.  Went to the photographers at Tidworth for photos but found that they weren't finished.  Returned early.</p>
<p>21 Wednesday<br/>Drilling very hard all day. Rather cloudy. Done some printing but am leaving them for fixing until tomorrow.  Got photos from photographers, the Egyptian photos turned out alright.  I am going to try to develop my own Films, I have rigged up a bit of a red lamp &amp; am now hoping for good results.<br/>We see plenty of aeroplanes here during the day, 3 or 4 being visible at one time.</p>
