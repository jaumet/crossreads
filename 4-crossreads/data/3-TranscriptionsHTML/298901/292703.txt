<p>Friday 26th April<br/>A much quieter day, cases coming in very slowly which gave me  time to get everything square which included the burial of 14 men who had died during the last 3 days.  Was much worried by the Padres as to the religion of the men as they wished to officiate only on their own men.  It is not often that they care much about this especially if they have been at the war any length of time.  At No 2 General I know that 3 Padres C of E, RC &amp; Methodist take each days burials in turn &amp; look on the matter as a routine being lucky or otherwise according to the number they strike.<br/>Collected drugs &amp; dressings during the day from Picquigny also a supply of stretchers.  Our crowd(Aussie) received very flattering congratulations from the heads today over the stunt, which from all accounts proved very successful indeed.  Our total put through for the stunt Gas &amp; wounded total about 1300, about half of each, which shows how successful</p>
