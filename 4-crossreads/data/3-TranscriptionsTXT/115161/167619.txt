 which we should start our attack. It would be about two o&#39;clock when we reached this spot. A white tape had been laid a few hours earlier as an indication to our officers that this was the position for the first &quot;wave&quot; to &quot;jump off&quot; from at the time appointed. 
 We were then shown our alotted places, and ordered to lie down, and make no noise. Between each man was a space of about six to eight feet. There were three lines (or waves to give the military term). The second line of men were placed about fifteen feet behind the front line, and took up positions immediately behind the centre of the vacant space of the front line.

After a time our eyes became accustomed to the darkness, and we could manage to discern objects in the near distance, and the general outline of the country over which in a few hours (a very, very few), we (or some of us) would pass.&nbsp; 
 Away on our left front appeared what looked like a village, and clumps of trees, while directly in front was level open country devoid of timber, with the exception of a small bush here and there. We would whisper &quot;good luck&quot; to the fellows round about us. We were all pals now, any little diferences we had had, were forgotten.&nbsp; 
 As before stated, the barrage would&quot;open&quot; at about 5.a.m. and would continue for a certain number of minutes at the same distance, and&nbsp;
