<p>Hut E. 8. Woodcote Convalescent Camp Epsom England 20/10/1915<br/>Dear Mother,<br/>I think there will be a mail leaving tomorrow which this letter should catch.  I expect to got go out on Furlough in about a fortnight. I can walk a bit without even a stick   &amp; broke my record since 7th June by walking about three miles with a stick.  Of course I will go   &amp; see our relations if I get a chance.  We get a free pass to travel anywhere to spend</p>
