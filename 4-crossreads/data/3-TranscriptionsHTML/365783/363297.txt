<p>I haven't seen Fred since yesterday to ask after his throat but he must be all right. I think he is working the cargo this morning. I asked him if he wanted any cash but he said that he was well supplied.<br/>You need not pack away my instruments when you are leaving. I would leave them just as they are. Winter looks after me real well and is a regular trump card &ndash; he says he can wash any of my things as we go along. I am hoping to have him at the front but fancy he will have to rejoin the R.A.M.C.<br/>Best love to the sweetest and best wife, the kiddies &amp; Father &amp; Mother,<br/>Au revoir,<br/>Yr. loving husband.<br/>Will.</p>
