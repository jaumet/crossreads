<p>A choir of stewards under the Purser led the singing, which was hearty: one of our sergeants resided at the organ &amp; carried his job through very well. As many of the troops as there was room for in the saloon were allowed to attend, &amp; seemed to enjoy the service.</p>
<p>Abt 11 o'clock passed a small steamer on the port side, towing 2 barges in the same direction that we are going.</p>
<p>During the rest of the morning &amp; in the afternoon busy writing, but gave up to attend the sing-song of hymns by passengers &amp; men. A perfect day, bright &amp; clear, with a mild breeze: sea exceedingly calm in the earlier part, but with a head wind &amp; some pitching as night approached.</p>
<p>Monday, 24 January 1916</p>
<p>Another fine day, but with a good deal of motion. Land was in sight throughout the day, the coastline appearing rough &amp; rugged, with bare patches of sand here &amp; there, &amp; occasionally rocky islets against which the waves dashed, raising masses of foam.</p>
<p>At dinner at night we had fiddles on the tables, &amp; even then there were several smashes. Parades held as usual: at the forenoon one had rifles &amp; bayonets &amp; taught my platoon how to Fix &amp; Unfix, work they had not had before.</p>
