<p>Another struggle back to green dump at midnight.</p>
<p>24th October (Tuesday)</p>
<p>Raining and dull again today.  Guns still on their dismal boom, ours giving Fritz fully 20 to 1.  Relieved tonight at 11 p.m. after 7 hours work because we have a more strenuous outing tomorrow.  Numbers of our men are now cracking up under the strain.</p>
<p>25th October (Wednesday)</p>
<p>No breakfast.  Called out</p>
