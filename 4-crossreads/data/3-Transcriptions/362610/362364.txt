<p>Sunday 28 May 1916<br/>Again a perfect day. Slept until 9.30 &amp; then had to take the reinforcements to an inspection by Bgdr. Gen. Smyth, who did not show up. Leo came along for awhile in the morning bringing a home letter that had just arrived. After lunch wrote one or two letters &amp; had just lain down &amp; dropped off when Rid came in. Had a great old yarn. He stopped for tea, which we had early on a/c of Capt. Herrod leaving for London, &amp; then as the night fatigue was cancelled at the last minute,  walked out home with Rid, arriving just in time for his 6 o'c service. On a/c of the brigade being on the point of departure for the front line, very few men were available for the service, but I enjoyed it immensely. A calm, perfect evening with a cloudless sky. Rich pasture thickly bespattered with daisies &amp; buttercups growing under the big old pear &amp; cherry trees. Cattle lazily browsing in an adjacent field. Rid seated at his baby organ in front of &frac12; a doz. of us sitting on the grass.<br/>In contrast to it all a captive obsern. balloon high up to the E &amp; presently an aeroplane flying over the lines : later quite a heavy bombardment was opened on it. Had a great little service &amp; then walked along to another billet, but no service was possible, so together we walked home, Rid returning on his bike.</p>
