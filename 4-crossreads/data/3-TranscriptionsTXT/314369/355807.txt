1915 April 4Easter Day
Nothing to do all day with one of my cpls. visit the N.Z. Artillery   &  examine the new Howitzers   &  Field GunsThey are all painted in patches of dark red yellow   &  brown which makes them blend with the ground a lot better than any one color would.A very bad sand storm springs up at dusk
