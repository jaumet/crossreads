I think it would be most appropriate to continue on with my Diary & end the report on the above date, as today is the second anniversary of our departure from sunny N.S.W. That eventful & somewhat sad morning, when we bid farewell on board the Beltana, is ever fresh n my memory. Little did I think then, of what lay before us, the past 24 months seem like a dream at times, & they are indeed very memorable months. Our experiences have been of a very varied character, pleasant & unpleasant (dark days & stirring days) exciting & unexciting. We have travelled many thousands of miles, & my views of the outside world have been considerably broadened & combined with the knowledge gained of conditions prevailing in the countries visited during the past two years has been the best education I have had. Five countries we have visited, Egypt, France, Belgium, England & Scotland, & from all appearances we should visit a few more before returning to Australia. Honestly speaking, I am not keen on travelling to other foreign lands, what we all want is to return to Australia, absolutely the best spot on this earth. In our travels quite a number of nationalities, we have come across, English, Irish, & Scotch troops, Egyptians, Arabs, French, Belgiums, Portusese, Indians West Africans, Americans, Chinese & Germans. A fair collection some of the habits & customs of the above are very peculiar & interesting - especially the Egyptians & Chinese.  We must certainly admit that German is a wonderful nation,  she is practically fighting the world.
This part is sure to upset you but why worry, I cam through alright & am O.K. at present. I think it best to tell of our experience, it is no use "beating about the bush".  Now please do not think that I send these different parts
