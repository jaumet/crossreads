2nd Feb.El ArishThe Turkish 'planes came over the other morning when it was very misty & dropped about 10 bombs - two in the sea.On clear days they usually come over but are kept at a distance by our A.A. guns.  I got a fright last night, I had just blown out the light & turned over when I thought I heard a 'plane coming.  I heard it for about 5 mins. but did not like to say anything for fear that I had what is known here as taubitis.Finally it became unmistakeable & turned out to be one of ours.  Tonight I have got nerves badly as it is a brilliant moonlight night, the moon is practically overhead & altogether an ideal night for them & we were over there last
