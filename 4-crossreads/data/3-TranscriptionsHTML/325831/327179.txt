<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have received your letter in regard to the sole surviving son of Judge Ferguson, now serving with the Australian Imperial Force. In regard to the suggestion that he be withdrawn from the firing line I have represented the case to Colonel Anderson for consideration whether this soldier can be employed on his staff or that of Sir Newton Moore.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>C.F. Pearce.</p>
