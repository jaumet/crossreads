<p>Sketched portion of African Coast in Gulf of Suez. The best attempt I have made yet. Passed about 8 or 9 vessels. We arrived at Suez about 5 p.m. About 20 big vessels in harbour, including 3 cruisers, a couple of converted cruisers, all painted grey. There was also a monitor from Mesopotamia painted yellow---as a match to the sandy banks of the Tigris.</p>
<p>Night very, very cold. Slept on deck.</p>
<p>Saturday, 26th:<br/>Morning bitterly cold. No news yet as to debarkation. Have been off colour all day, listless, depressed. Played cards most of the day. I am sorry the voyage is over---it has been splendid---but we all feel glad that we are getting closer to the "game". Furphies and all manner of <strike>Budgets</strike> rumours numerous and varied. Every few minutes would bring forth some new one---The Captain told the head stoker, or the Colonel's batman</p>
