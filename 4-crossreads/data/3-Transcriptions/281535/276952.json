<p>10/5/19<br/>Marcinelle<br/>A somewhat close summery day. Up at 6 and had breakfast etc. Great preparations among the troops on account of departure. Formed up in the Marcinelle Square and left at 7.30 headed by the band and colours. Many entire families of civilians had turned out to farewell the troops. Arrived at the station our entrainment was completed quietly &amp; without incident. A feature of our departures was the embracing. I kissed Doctor Mathys, the children and his wife. The latterly, in tears, naively said she had much wanted to kiss me the night before. At Cornil I commenced with the little Marie Antoinette and finished with the old Mme and Monsieur. A great crowd at the station. All the men embracing the different families &ndash; many in tears.</p>
