I'm mess caterer & put 8 bottles of Beer in the ice chest & one was stolen inside 12 hours & I talked freely & insisted on the fact that some steward  stole  this (I'm certain) - I've been told that my thoroughness & strictness wont be liked to which I've retorted that when thieves fall out honest men come by their own - That makes 104 bottles  stolen  on the Fantome &  129  stolen on the Eastern - value Eastern bottles 6-17-6 for which  I  have to pay my whack - I'm out - looking for honest men - now for a connected story -
