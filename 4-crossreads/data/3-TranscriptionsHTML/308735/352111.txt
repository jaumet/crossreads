<p>and a change of clothes.  After tea went to Pont Remy by motor and saw the "Smart Set" Concert.  They give a very good show.</p>
<p>Friday June 14th<br/>Went to Dr. about my headaches, he gave me some tablets that made me feel queer.  Got a letter from Rol King.  1.30 Muster parade, all the Batteries had their photos taken, the 41st were first;  had the rest of the afternoon off.  After tea went into Pont Remy by car and back again, saw a queer sight on the road (A french woman [indecipherable]).</p>
<p>Saturday June 15th<br/>6.30 had to go to river and pump water for the horses.  9 a.m. took two horses out to exercise and graze, one of them fell into the swamp and couldn't get out, had to get chains under him and pull him out.  I got covered with mud during the operations.  When I got back I felt I wanted some vaseline.  Had the afternoon off.  After tea went to the final concert of the Smart Set at Pont Remy.  It was a splendid show and have some good talent amongst them, came home by car.  Sewed my colours on tunic.</p>
<p>Sunday June 16th<br/>6.30 had to go to the river again and draw water for the horses.  9.30 a.m. we were dismissed, I then went for a walk through the woods among the ferns and wild flowers.  It made me long to be back home again.  After tea went to picture show at Epange, passed a couple of hours away, even if I did have to sit on the floor.  then came home and wrote letters.</p>
