 We had lunch at Mariette's House, the house where M. Mariette lived while he was  official  director of official excavations in Egypt &amp; then visited the Serapeum or subterranean Tombs of Apis &ndash; hewn in the rock.  Apis the sacred bull of the god Ptah was worshipped in a special temple at Memphis &amp; after death embalmed like a human being &amp; interred with great pomp in the necropolis of Memphis.  Under Ramases II 1291-1225 BC, 67 yrs., sometimes thought to be pharoah of Exodus but no proof, this huge sub-terranean tomb chamber was hewn in the rock &amp; we saw the huge granite sarcophagi wh. formerly contained the Apis mummies.  When discovered in 1851 all the sarcophagi had been emptied except 2 which had escaped the notice of plunderers and were in their original condition although 3700 years had elapsed since they were closed!
