<p>[In a box in the middle of the page a sketch of a Gurkha soldier entitled A Gurkha with the following text]:</p>
<p>On the peninsular the Gurjhas wore light  [indecipherable] uniforms with short trousers and a felt hat similar to our own.  They were well built but small, and were in appearance very much like a Japanese.]</p>
