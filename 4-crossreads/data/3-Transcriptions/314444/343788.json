<p>Gallipoli<br/>Wednesday 6th Oct.</p>
<p>Dear Harry</p>
<p>Im glad to see that you have at last discovered a conscience I thought you were one of those lost soul without any, dont go backsliding but write every mail I have been hoping to see you over here shortly so have not written before my sister told me you were going to inlist.<br/>Never mind Harry this is not much of a place to come to. You ought to see its steep cliffs rising up one behind the other <strike>with</strike> covered with low scrub and deep winding gullies in between, we will never realize the tremenous job those first men tackled in getting here.<br/>We've been here 7 weeks and have made the aquantance of all the Turkish delights. it was'nt long before we knew all about shrapnel, the day after landing we had to sprint across a flat while they pumped it into us, there were no records broken we were carrying to much weight. loaded up like pack horses.<br/>Its something like this. First you hear it frizzling through the air, when everybody dashes for the nearest Dug-out, an explosion, a pretty white cloud in the sky, and lots of lead whizzling all round you.</p>
<p>We will all be expert navvies by the time we get back. Im sure we've used picks &amp; shovels a great deal more than our rifles. and you somehow forget all about the government stoke  when the bullets begin humming around</p>
<p>["Government stroke", Australian slang for the deliberately slow pace of work supposed to be typical of government workers.]</p>
