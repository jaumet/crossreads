Sat 6th Oct (cont.)The "Wolf" was examing a neutral (without revealing her identity) when what was taken to be a British auxiliary cruiser was sighted.
The hatches were closed on us, our one exit was covered with an iron grating which was further held down by huge sacks of dried peas!
There were to be no prisoner-survivors if "Wolf" went to the bottom, that was evident!
The vessel was not an auxiliary, merely the usual armed merchantman.   "Wolf" chased her hard all night, but when morning broke she was too far off to be caught.
She was clearly visible on our port beam - looked like a big Blue Funnel Liner.
When she was out of sight "Wolf" turned on his tracks and made straight for the base.
