We are having our April showers now & all the trees are in bud & the birds singing & whistling like fury.  I have not been away anywhere for some days but I saw Ellis last Tuesday on His way to Glasgow where He was to go aboard ship.
Well, My Dear Ones, it is getting late & I've been bustling around all day, so I'll have a shave & get down to my little bed.
Cheerio, my best love
