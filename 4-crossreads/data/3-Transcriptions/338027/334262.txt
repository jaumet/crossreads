<p>Wednesday, 28 October, 1914<br/>About nine am the N.Z. troops with their convoy were sighted coming into the sound they made an imposing spectacle they anchored in line with us and the cruisers were dodging all over harbour.</p>
<p>At tea time a party of the men came over to us in a boat and exchanged greetings they stated that they have been six weeks on the water and came straight from Hobart on the voyage they lost 3 horses &amp; one man.</p>
<p>Concert at night great success I recited Fuzzy Wuzzy &amp; The Day &amp; was recalled.</p>
<p>Thursday, 29 October, 1914<br/>Still in K Georges Sound, mail arrives for lucky ones nearly every day.</p>
<p>All the fleet here now ready to move off, I think reason of delay is to allow N.Z. troopers to take fresh water.</p>
<p>Had fire &amp; hose drill, I am detailed to No 5 squad amidships on the pump.</p>
<p>Was inoculated for the second time.</p>
<p>Spent a lot of time reading we have a library on board containing some good books.</p>
