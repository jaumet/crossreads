<p>30 Oct, 1916<br/>Hill 70<br/>Slowly pass the days, each like its mate. lifeless things.  The nights are different change less enough, but theres a feeling about that takes them out of the common place.  The boys group in tents &amp; mess rooms, over cups of coaco at the Y.M. or a bottle of beer from the Wet Canteen &amp; talk of all manner of things; they are more cheerful, not such a feeling of bally endlessness about it all as there is of the day.  A bright cresent moon is floating quietly above the western horizon &amp; the clouds about it are streaked with silver while a faint rosiness of the after glow still lingers, the stars are brighter than diamonds &amp; the sky looks like black velvet, the crickets are chiruping &amp; the boys laughing.  At the table at the end of the mess, the boys are playing cards &amp; there is a clink of money as it changes hands &amp; the flip flop of the cards as they are dealt round; some curses &amp; a laugh.  Some one out side, is whistling  Every bodys doing it &amp; a horse blows its nose.</p>
