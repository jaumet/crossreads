 October 16 60. The Literary Supplement, Oct. 11, today&hellip; a dull uninteresting issue.  It announces Frankeau's 'Woman of the Horizon' &ndash; and I'm half for sending for it.  Chatto and Windus announce Charleston's "Short History of England", and the 3rd impression printing of Nichol's "Ardours and Endurances".  Always Chatto and Windus announce their new books more finely than the other publishers. 
 In 'Notes' Blackwells announce the first four volumes of a new library of classics. 'The Sheldonian' series of reprints and renderings of Masterpieces in all Languages&hellip;. a rather full covering and ambitious series&hellip;  The first 4 include three attractive titles, "Songs and Sayings of Walter von de Vogelweide"  Mennesange by Frank Betts (he of that [indecipherable] all 'Iron Age' book of verse), 'Sir Thomas Browne's letter to a Friend' upon the occasion of the death of an intimate friend, "The Funeral Oration of Pericles", trans. by Thomas Hobbs of Malmesbury and Mystical Odes of Jelahadin Rumi trans. by Reginald Hewitt. 
 No prices or dates of publishing are announced, but from now-a-days series they ought to be well and beautifully published.

 62.  October 17 Fatigue this morning &ndash; the building of a mound of earth about the horse lines:  protection against bombs dropp'd.  Again 20 chaps up to Ypres clearing the way for a new light railway.  Today Buckholz, Johnnie and Carty up.  Leaving here at 6 a.m., they arrive back at 8 p.m&hellip; a long day's heavy fatigue.
