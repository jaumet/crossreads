through six inches of snow. We were all glad when we arived to get a feed & get between the blankets. In camp for a few days with nothing much to do. Very cold all the time while there. Went on Embarkation Live i Leave which Lasted four days but never had much enjoyment out of it. for I had to go to Hospital before my time was up. Was there six weeks and had to get a good time getting free theatre
