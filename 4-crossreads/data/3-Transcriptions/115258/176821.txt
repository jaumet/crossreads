<p>the afternoon and this morning I have to go off to some place for a three days school on signalling with aeroplanes, and after that there is talk of another stunt so I have to finish this letter off at once. I am posting home this morning per registered post a big book of views of Jerusalem; I bought it while I was up there and have seen a good many of the places shown in it - will write you a description of them when I go on with my book; also a packet of 10 photos. These photos are taken from a film found in a camera captured from a Turkish officer and the chap who got the camera took it on and took photos with it of Alenby&#39;s entry of Jerusalem. The photos of the turks are supposed to be at Sheria - but I cannot swear to it, although it look like the country there - but thay are dinkum turks alright and of course the Jerusalem ones are correct. Our interpreter&#39;s photo is in one of them near the Jaffa gate and he was telling me all about them. Must stop now Mother. Love to Father&nbsp; the boys &amp; yourself. I am Your loving son, Robert C Wilson</p>
