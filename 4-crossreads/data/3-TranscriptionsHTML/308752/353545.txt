<p>On the 7th. inst, I was told to report to V----- (the village we stopped at on the 28th of last month) for stores.  Enjoyed a fine long spin of about 30 kilos. in an Ambulance car. It was a most interesting trip, &amp; I considered myself very lucky indeed, being chosen for the job. Passed through one of the leading cities of France, but alas it was in a sorry plight.
