 THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; cold. Went down to H.Q. 
 &amp; found my papers were all 
 ready to be signed. I got another 
 week&#39;s leave. Kieth &amp; Barry 
 got word to get everything 
 ready to go in the morning, 
 so they were bustling round 
 all day. I went to the pictures 
 again in the afternoon &amp; stayed 
 at home at night.
