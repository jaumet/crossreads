<p>My little commedian friend, when taking soup raises his right elbow to a level with his shoulder, presents the point of the spoon to his capacious mouth pours in and swallows, the earlier movements resulting in his elbow coming up against my left ear.  At breakfast this morning he surpassed himself in the using of his fingers to remove pieces of material from his mouth to place them on his plate then licking the soiled fingers as a skilled practitioner.  Eat!  Jerusalem Kruseos!  He can eat anything.  Everything at the same time.  In record time.  The Lord must have endowed him with gastric juices capable for breaking up anything.  Mildly I hinted to him a lunch &ndash; "Something at this table is real high!" &ndash; He then appreciated that 'twas the tripe which he was eating.  "This is", remarked he, having eaten half of it he let the waiter take the remainder away and he attacked another plate of something else.  He can eat!  Little fellow as he is.  Yet is he a source of constant amusement and concern to me.  In this much should I be thankful.</p>
<p>As a sequel to the visit by Father Neptune and his wife photographic films hang in all directions throughout the ship.</p>
<p>2 p.m. with us.  You are probably, 6-30 p.m, seated comfortably at your tea.  Hope I that you are enjoying it.  Wonder I are you at home or somewhere distant from No. 219.</p>
<p>My calendars, a Shakespeare &amp; a Ruskin were hung this morning in readiness to be fully exposed for use on New Year's day 1915 A.D.</p>
<p>4-30 p.m.  Merry parties of our people are, at this moment, distributed over the ship, partaking of afternoon tea.  At each gathering there are bedecked cakes &amp; fancy goods of many kinds for consumption, while laughter and wreathed smiles are to be heard &amp; seen on all sides.  Good luck to all.  May they see many Merry Christmases.</p>
