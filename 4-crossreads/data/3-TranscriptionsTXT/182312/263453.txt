have to hurry away at once for a buss or Tube to get into Victoria
Station in time, he produces two other men to help him blow whistles.
They make Portland Place hideous with their whistles and then all three
come and tell me that a taxi (which I have no doubt has been round the
corner all the time) is at the door, having been secured at great
difficulty.  My advice to Hotel visitors is never to leave at seven
in the morning for at that hour you catch the staff "changing over":
there they are, both the night and the day shifts forming a sort of
"arch of palms" on steps.  The girl at the "leave keys here" counter
grins.  How I hate that girl.  I get through with the loss of much
small change, all the while wondering how anybody could possibly say
that the British Nation is not organised.  On the pavement I am
confronted by the "superpalm" in the person of the resplendent
Commissionaire with much gold braid and many medals (the coat with
medals attached I suspect as being supplied by the Hotel).  He has
a huge umbrella in one hand and a mudguard in the other.  Ha, here is
someone at last whom I can out-general for he hasn't got a palm to
spare.  He seems to devine my intention however and in one bound reaches
the door handle of the taxi before me.  I succomb.  "Where to, Sir?"
he asks.  "To Victoria Station and tell him to drive like the devil".
     As I watch that taxi driver's back xxxxxxxxx through
the window I sort of take a liking to him.  He is going to be paid
for DOING something for me.  The idea appeals to me and I give him
an extra shilling or so, instead of the customary tuppence.  "Thank
you Sir", he says, "And I hope you have a comfortable crossing".
Somehow I was glad to receive that old chap's well wishes, they seemed
genuine. 
     The scene at Victoria Station on the departure of the
leave train is one which has over and over again been described in the
