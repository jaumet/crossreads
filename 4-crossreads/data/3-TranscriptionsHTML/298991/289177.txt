<p>Wednesday June 6th<br/>Very quiet all day. Rained fairly heavy last night, but turned out fine today. Doing both physical drill &amp; route march before &amp; after dinner. (Went to a free entertainment at the Pavilion Hall, It was both very good &amp; comical, went for a walk round <strike>Weymouth</strike> Portland harbour, it is very pretty round there.) x.</p>
<p>Thursday June 7th<br/>x Should read today, nothing startling in camp. I don't notice the Adjutant knocking about so much since he was counted out. I heard he is to go back to Australia, then it is only those sort of sooners who can get back so easy.</p>
<p>Friday 8th June</p>
<p>Rather a dull bleak day. Marked from B1 A3 to A3 &amp; transferred to B Group, No 56 hut, I suppose it means I will be back in France very soon now. Put on draft to go to Perham Downs tomorrow morning, in my opinion they are a bit sudden. Went out canoeing in Weymouth harbour, the water was very calm &amp; we had a grand time. Another fellow &amp; myself went out in a double canoe.</p>
<p>Saturday June 9th<br/>A lovely day. Owing to being on draft had to get up at 5.30, &amp; have breakfast at 6 am, but when I went to fall in, the sergeant informed me that I had been cut off, of course I did not mind</p>
