Yet our bill of fare is cut down 100% Being surrounded by ships having been torpedoed & sunk it makes a man think & hardens one's heart. We all feel on board like killing all Germans in cold blood. News through that the Brittish have advanced at the Western front by using some new kind of gas. Also of the Yanks having built very large & extensive factories in Scotland for building airoplanes. New gun layers told off today & naval stokers for our furnaces & signalmen for the navigation bridge. Also bluejackets with loaded rifles & fixed bayonets told off for each boat & raft to prevent the rushing of boats in the event of being torpedoed.
