<p>Wednesday 20 February<br/>"Stiffness".  Very wet day making the football ground at Met&eacute;ren very wet &amp; slippery.  The match against 1st Battn. resulted in a heavy defeat for us 22-nil.  The Battalion play was superior in all respects &amp; the better team won.</p>
<p>Thursday 21 February<br/>Most glorious day.  A Euchre party at night was a success, I winning six games of twelve.</p>
