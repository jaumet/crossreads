  
 out much longer is doubtful, for at times I feel very lonely & you know I am getting on in years. 
 Have been out boating on the reservoir all the afternoon with the girls, she is a fine stretch of water nearly a mile long & 1/2 wide & fringed with trees on 3 sides, at the top end there is a big skating rink which seems to be well patronized, they have nice little boats here seated for 2, you would not have thought there was much the matter with me, had you seen my driving my little skiff through the water, had some fun later on teaching the girl to row but she got on famously & would soon learn to feather her oars like an old boatman we had my camera out & got a few shots on & off the water I don't know what I should do if it
