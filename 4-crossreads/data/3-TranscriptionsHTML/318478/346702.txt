<p>Gallipoli Peninsular<br/>Sunday 23rd Feb. 1919<br/>10 p.m.</p>
<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>I have accomplished the whole day without painting and I feel quite important.  The boys may be interested to learn that I determined early this morning to rest or rather loaf about like a schoolboy on the first day of the holidays without a set programme of enjoyment.  The net result is a strong bench put up in my studio tent, a swell clothes stand &amp; boot shelf in the sleeping marquee, last &amp; not too dusty a very elaborate Jackal trap, so complicated and at the present untried stage so efficient-looking that our Sergeant suggested that notice boards be put up in the surrounding gullies inviting or directing enterprising Jacks to come in &amp; have a treat.</p>
<p>Tim who I hope is quite alright, may be interested in the appended design.  If no luck tonight we intend transplanting * Anemones, Crocus, and other wild flowers to give the trap a homely &amp; encouraging appearance.</p>
