  
 If so we shall do our best to make them strong and hardy again. 
 Acting for the O.C. a piece of bad news has just come to me.  David Storey M.L.A. for Randwick has two sons here, one Jack is a doctor with us, & word has just been brought to me that he is developing pneumonia.  That is sad because most of the deaths here have been a sequel to this inflammation of the lungs.  I hope that he will not have a severe attack. 
 Dr Kennedy is also in hospital.  He has for some weeks looked to be very sick.  On an expedition, such as ours, one is blessed if he is kept in good fettle by the grace of God, & badly served if he is not so favoured.  Think you not so.  My constant prayer is for good health & plenty of strength wherewith to battle. 
 A long enough letter you will think.  Therefore shall it be ended, closed in an envelope & given start to you. 
 To all my friends good luck.  To You lives prosperous long and happy, each moment blessed by God, in simpleness in gentleness & honour and clean mirth. 
 Love in [diagram of Os] & kisses in [diagram of Xs] bales upon bales for each from Your lvgg & & affectionate Father John B Nash
