  
 I had of course yours of 29th May readdressed  on from Sis, but that's all - Its rotten the consistency with which they seem to bag Aust. boats. 
 Will stop now - as I want to get a letter off to Mary & a visit to the wagon lines is pending so must hurry. 
 Love to selves & Pat Your affect son Terence. 
 PS I am sending the Mother a short cable today. Enclosed is a photo of Lt Col & Mrs Williams. I would like it kept for me, as they get spoilt over here TWG
