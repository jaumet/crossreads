  
 Bulford X'mas Night 1917 Dear Dad, Mum & George, Just a few lines on this lovely night to shew that we thought of You all.  It has been a lovely day & is now a perfect moonlight night & not a cloud in the sky.  I had a real good dinner & Ellis is away having His now.  I am going now to Dave after I finish this short note.  I went for a long walk this afternoon & Ellis came part of the way with me.  He won't walk anywhere & I prefer walking the Downs to sitting in my Room.  We had a small present from the Y.M.C.A. & smokes from the Red X.  Marie sent me a box of sweets & I had about 6 or 8 X'mas cards from various English Friends.  I hope that you all had a nice Time we had Roast Duck & plenty of everything so we fared as usual, well. Well, Dad & Mum & George, I've nothing of note to tell You.  We are both well & living as comfy & happy as possible.  We have no end of Friends & cannot want for anything except our Manly Home. Best of Fond Love to You all Be Merry & Bright.  We have to be & are always.  We live to return Home soon & that keeps us Buoyant Yours always Harry
