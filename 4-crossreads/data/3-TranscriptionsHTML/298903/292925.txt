<p>Tuesday 22nd  Finals of boxing championship held during the afternoon whilst at night pictures were shown of Australia.  Sent off a radio-telegram telling them what ship I was on &amp; probable arrival, rather a novelty &amp; only 11d per word.  Everyone is now being medically examined as regards pension rights etc. but most on board are A class.  All the work connected to our discharge is being done on board.  Our pay books have been checked over with records from London and within four days of our landing, these will be paid into any bank named, all money owing to us including deferred pay &amp; the full amount of furlough</p>
