Villers Brettoneaux. Bty PositionEarly during the morning Fritz had a mad minute barrage.Ken Gunn left with Sheedy for L'aison. Fritz fired a large dump of S.A.A. and big stuff quite handy. He also set a few stretches of camouflage a fire near a gun position. Weather fine and looks like holding for awhile. I hope it does. Best luck to the stunt tomorrow.
