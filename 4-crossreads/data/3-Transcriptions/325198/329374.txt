<p>27 Sept, 1916<br/>El Hassaniya<br/>I am having a big loafe to day, just lying in the shade of the old bivvie reading the papers brought by the last mail &amp; smoking cigarettes.  There are several rumours afloat concerning a move for us.  Last night all surplus gear was handed in by the sergeants &amp; all the dismounted men were packed off this morning.  Salhia was favourite last night<br/>for our destination stakes but Johno came back a few minutes ago &amp; he says that we are going to Hill 70 then back to [Duiedah?].  There was also big talk of being equiped &amp; trained for cavalry work. I wonder what it feels like to be swinging on to the end of a sword<br/>It came out in orders a few days ago that there was no truth in the rumour which seemed prevalent that the ALH was to move to France.  Why they should take the trouble to contradict a rumour which has stalked amongst us continually since our arrival in Egypt &ndash; now I cant for a moment imagine its one of the pleasant characteristics of our army.</p>
