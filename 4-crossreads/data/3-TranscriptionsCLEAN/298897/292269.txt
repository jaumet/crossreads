  
 1 A.M. but the night was a mild one so it was not too bad. 
 Tuesday 25th April 1916 
 1st Anniversary of landing at Gallipoli Kept up as a holiday.  Church service held in the morning, the address being an exhortation to the new men to keep fit & emulate the deeds of the 1st Division. Ribbons were issued for the Anzacs to wear.  Red for those at the landing & blue for those who landed after.  The combined colours were rare & personally I felt very proud to be able to show both ribbons during the day.  Then during the afternoon aquatic sports were held, swimming races, diving etc. & some good talent came to light.  I entered in the manacle race (hands tied together) & came third.  The race was very exhausting, especially as I swam on my chest thinking it was compulsory.  The place getters both swam on their backs but I was only beaten for 2nd place by inches.  Three prizes were promised and at the distribution of prizes during the evening my name was called but then the announcer corrected himself & said the third prize had been struck out.  Why this had been done I do
