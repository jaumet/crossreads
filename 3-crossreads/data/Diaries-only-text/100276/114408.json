3rd. We had no less than 3 gas alarms last night, you could hear the horns for miles miles they kick up an awful row, but each one turned out to be a blank.
There is great aerial activity this morning our chaps are busy shooting their anti-aircrafts at them chasing them back over their own lines, old Fritz is spouting up into the clouds hundreds of shells at our battleplanes Tucker is still pretty crook a slice of bread jam for breakfast only no tea so far.
This morning broke nice sunny for a while it was bonzer but it looks very much like rain this afternoon, it is muggy close.
