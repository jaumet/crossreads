  
 Relations with Cpl Merrilees & Major Strachan have a little improved lately. Fancy latter is inclined to have favourites & does not care a rap about the rest as individuals.  If he gets a dislike for a chap he works off his feelings by mean actions. Gertie has developed his eccentric mannerisms & is a little less popular than before  In some ways has improved & in others not Generally less noisy. Means well but fails lamentably.
