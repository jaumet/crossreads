 13/2/16 Slept in until 0730. church parade 0930, fairly small owing to "B" Co being occupied  on defence work. Erected an observation post on Hogs Back, very difficult to work in owing to the loose sand shifting and blowing easily. About lunch a nigger was brought in under arrest from 21st &ndash; found prying round their trenches. He squatted down on the sand and over him was a big sentry with fixed bayonet,  big  hot sun streaming down on the sand and over his little skull cap. All the lads inspecting him, - comments firing, "He's a Joe! The've gotter b&mdash; Abdul". "He is neither a b&mdash; Joe Burke or a b&mdash; Sigheader  - he is a b&mdash;Armenian". "Armenian be b&mdash; he's a treacherous Abdul b&mdash;." Another also brought up for examination very picturesque Arab burnous. 
 After lunch had some boxing and rifle exercise competitions. No. 6 platoon, M. guns, and No. 2 still to go. 16 teams of 12 competed and the interest taken was wonderful, the work very good. 23rd band over. A good afternoon with Brigadier B.M &amp; CO as judges. Men sing to tune of Holy! Holy! Holy! a song 
 "Marching! marching marching Always b&mdash; well marching When we are dead and in our graves We'll b&mdash; well march no more!. 
 Revetting, entanglements and digging are being pushed on with all speed and all hands work hard. Rumoured today the 19th Battn is split into two under the new organization. A number of gift magazines arrived and a great many lined up to the padre's tent for backsheese literature. Our mess very good with Dixon as messman and the waiters from the ranks are all old stewards. Lights out is greeted by the singing of "Good night Abdul" to the tune of "Good night Ladies" we'll meet again soon.
