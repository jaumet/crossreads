23/12/18 Gourdinne
The little Keithlet has done wonders today bargaining in French with farmers and generally fixing things up. The weather extremely cold and showery. Towards the evening we had a fine lot of canteen stuff come in and also drew our Xmas puddings.

A fine day at 10.30 all available men lined up in the square to bid farewell to our 1915 quota of old battlers whom I shook by the hand individually and then the band played ?Auld Lang Syne" after the crowd had given three hearty cheers. In a G.S. wagon our gallant batch then went over to Nallines . Mounted my chestnut and rode over there too meeting General Robertson at BdeH.Q. We then walked down to a ground where most of the Bde was formed up.
