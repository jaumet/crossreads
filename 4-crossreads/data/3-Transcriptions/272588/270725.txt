<p>Wednesday 19 June<br/>To-night a German aviator attempted to bring two of our balloons down but in so trying he met three of our 'planes and was brought down in flames. Still fine weather.</p>
<p>Thursday 20 June<br/>A long walk to-day through Hazebrouck to Sercus, the first walk into civilization I have been for months.  It is quite good to be able to talk to several very nice girls again.</p>
<p>Friday 21 June<br/>Another walk to Sercus through Wallon Cappel, to see dentist who did a filling for me.</p>
