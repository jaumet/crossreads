<p>This letter, referring to his death, is written by Sergeant John William Nunn, No 2756, 3rd Battalion.]<br/>Somewhere in France<br/>12/11/16</p>
<p>My dear Mrs Burrows.</p>
<p>As Sergeant of the platoon of which your husband was a member, I wish on behalf of the men to express their deepest sympathy to you in the loss of your husband.</p>
<p>I wish also to express the deep regret that is felt by all the men of the platoon, at losing a friend, who was both a soldier and a man.</p>
<p>He was a grand soldier and a good comrade. He had greater experience than most of us, as a soldier, and used his experience to help &amp; cheer the younger men with us.</p>
<p>Concerning his death, he was killed almost instantaneous by concushion from a shell which burst where he was lying, so suffered no pain.</p>
<p>Hoping God will help you to endure your loss, and that you will remember he did his best &ndash;  He died for his friends,<br/>I remain<br/>Yours in Sympathy<br/>J. W. Nunn Sgt.</p>
