<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Thursday 2</p>
<p>Work in morning &amp; part of afternoon.</p>
<p>Down in Wassa again with Kennett in evening.  Infinitely more impressive at night time.</p>
<p>Glad of a day or twos easy time.</p>
<p>The climate is not exceptionally hot but enough so.</p>
<p>Not troubled by insects except a few flies which are very persistent.</p>
<p>Not troubled by glare yet &amp; hope not to be.</p>
<p>Natives are extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Some young Egyptian boys are very well looking youngsters.</p>
<p>Cont.</p>
