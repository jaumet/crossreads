Another walk and caught car back to city arriving about 6.30. and went to Anzac Lounge. Met Child Mac &amp; Lynch. Had some cool drinks before leaving Camps Bay and some more at Y.M before meeting others. Then some more fruit and lemonade and down to pier. Spent awhile there and back to boat about 9. On evening of 21 met a chap from Riverton and down to pier with him but soon said goodbye. Still coaling and no sign of going out. To bed after a talk about our experiences and slept well. 
 23.3.19. Sunday. Fine slightly cloudy. Up at 8 and feeling dopily tired all day. Still coaling and finished about 11. Tug moved us out at 11.50 and rather good send off. Good crowd on various piers cheered us and most of ships dipped their flags. Took some time to manoeuvre round and watched on deck and got some more photos. Only had pudding for dinner. Had a game of bridge in morning and played awhile in aftn. and wrote diary rest of time and in evening.
