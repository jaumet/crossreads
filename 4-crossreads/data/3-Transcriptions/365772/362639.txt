<p>to the number you write me. I cannot tell you how pleased I was to get that mail last night it being the first from you since you heard I was wounded, there is a lot of mail somewhere which I will never get, the postal arrangements for the troops is scandalous.<br/>As you will notice by the above address I have again changed my place of abode this is my third "home" since being wounded. Helwan itself is a small town or rather village about 15 miles from Cairo by train up the Nile, it is famous for its sulphur baths &amp; in the season is one of the popular resorts for aristocratic Europe last season before the war the Crown Prince was here. There are 3 big &amp; numerous small hotels here the Government have two of the big ones for convalescent homes for us troops &amp; are capable of keeping about 2000 men here. Of course there are bigger homes than these at Alexandria</p>
