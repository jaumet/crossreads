4/5/18 Querrieu

They seem not at all a bad lot of chaps and comprise a few jockeys who had joined the "Sportmen's Battalion". I addressed them on esprit de corps and they then moved off under their officers and were played along the streets by our band. Returned to my billet and there picked up Murphy and my horse. First drew up a small tactical scheme involving attack and counter attack on some pontoon bridge at Blagny Tronville and sent off some officers to reconnoitre and write the orders. Rode along the road until I struck Smith and all his Lewis gunners. Stayed with them for a while and then continued on through grassy fields to St Gratien, on my left all the time was a splendid forest the Bois de Mai, in which all tones of green blended. Here and there were a few dark trees like pine on St Gratien the 3rd DHQ are located. Passed on to Molliens au Bois and found Capt Davis at his billet there with Kohn Dundas. Our nucleus here have been having rather a bad time for rations. Where the officers are lodged is an old house of the usual style. The people are ?convenable?. There are 3 daughters ? none beautiful. In the mess was an old weaving machine and they explained that the old man was a weaver but lack of supplies prevented him from carrying on. The back garden of this house is beautifully trim and
