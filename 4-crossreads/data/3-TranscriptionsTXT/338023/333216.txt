 [Letter written on paper with Church of England Soldiers' Institute letterhead] 2nd October 1916 
 My Dear Mother 
 Owing to lack of evidence to prove necessity of my going to Sydney, they turned me down quite flatly. I then applied for weekend leave from Friday night to 1 pm to-day but was again out-manoeuvered &ndash; they granted me leave from 6 am Sat to 9 today! - &amp; withheld the pass on Friday night until the Sydney train had gone! 
 I have now applied for leave without pay to go to Sydney &amp; stated, as a reason for wanting to go home, that you are ill &ndash; a semi invalid - &amp; all the rest of it. It's the only chance &amp; I very much want to get over to see you before I go. 
 It would look much more circumstantial,  in the eyes of our heads here, if I had an  urgent  wire to back me up. Ask father to send it , will you? 
 When I have more time I have quite a lot to tell you about the floods. We've been, literally, up to our eyes in flood &ndash; very enjoyable! 
 With much love  Harry 
 Writing to Betty next. If you wire, do so as soon as you get this.
