<p>laughter at a red-nosed comedian who is making the time honoured jokes</p>
<p>about mothers-in-law, Von Tirpitz&#39; whiskers and so forth.&nbsp; These</p>
<p>people have paid up to 12/6 each for their seats and frequently have</p>
<p>to book a week ahead to get them.&nbsp; A new theatre - St. Martins -</p>
<p>opened early in November and the price of front stalls was fixed at a</p>
<p>guinea and this for an ordinary Revue!&nbsp; I wonder if the people will</p>
<p>be fools enough to pay it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My stay in England is at an end and I am off to France</p>
<p>again in the morning.&nbsp; The packing up of my gear takes up all the</p>
<p>afternoon (<u>I must have my last evening free</u>) despite the fact that I</p>
<p>have the assistance of the Hotel valet to fold all my clothes.&nbsp; What</p>
<p>to take with me in my valise and what to leave in London is the</p>
<p>subject of much thought and mind changing, but experience of humping a</p>
<p>lot of useless stuff about France has taught me a lot and finally the</p>
<p>valise is packed with bare necessities and looks about half its former</p>
<p>size.&nbsp; I flatter myself that this is due to having left out a lot of</p>
<p>unnecessary things, but the truth of the matter is that it is mainly</p>
<p>due to having my clothes packed by someone who knows how to do it.</p>
<p>Like most men when left to themselves, my idea of packing is to roll</p>
<p>everything up into a ball, shove them into the valise and then stand</p>
<p>on the result in an effort to make the straps meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knowledge that a visitor is leaving spreads round&nbsp; the</p>
<p>Hotel staff like wild fire.&nbsp; The &quot;Boots&quot; doesn&#39;t leave your footgear</p>
<p>outside that morning but brings them in and makes some remark about it</p>
<p>being a lovely day to travel.&nbsp; The liftman who is to take your</p>
<p>luggage down stairs&nbsp; finds it will need two men, and departs for a</p>
<p>friend.&nbsp; I tell a porter to get a taxi and after impressing me with</p>
<p>the great difficulty of securing a taxi at that hour of the morning,</p>
<p>and thus worry me into going without my breakfast for fear I may</p>
