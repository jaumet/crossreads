4/4/18 - Caestre
gangs of Chinese coolies. Noticed that many gates here are formed by cutting down a tree and lopping its roots. This heavy part hangs over a gate post and balances the gate. Pleasant flat country hereabouts with plenty of cultivation, winding roads and red thatched farm houses. Travelled all night in the usual uncomfortable manner. Trying to snatch a little sleep half sitting, half lying. No gas on in the carriage so we stuck candles all round the doors and windows. Passed Hazebrouck, St. Omer, Calais in daylight and came through Etaples and Boulogne after dark. A journey of 12 hours.
