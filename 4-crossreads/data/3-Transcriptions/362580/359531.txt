<p>My dear old Belle,</p>
<p>We are still in the same spot but very contented.  The weather is beautiful here &amp; the place is a real beauty spot.  We are very sorry that our old Unit has moved on without us but most likely we shall follow shortly.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Dorothy from Alexandria saying Good-bye but did not know where they were bound for.  It was written on 29th March.  So we are separated once more, also Consie Murray.  I'm awfully sorry they are not with us.  It would be too good for Active Service, if we three were together.<br/>I've been on Night-duty a whole week now and am quite surprised at myself sleeping so well, also am feeling splendid.  We have been very busy this week but am a little easier to-night.  Have plenty to do to keep myself from feeling sleepy.  I have not sent the parcels yet, must try &amp; fix them up this week.  Thought I should be bringing them home with me but think now I may not be able</p>
