<p>3.  to the Holiday Resort at Cleethorpe's   It is a grand place with a Pier &amp; a 2 mile Promenade.  We went to a Theatre on two of our Evenings.  At one show one of the Principal Artists was a Pal of Mrs Harbert's Daughter.  I went round to the Stage Door &amp; had a 10 minute chat with Her.  Jennie is a sweet natured girl, different to Marie altogether.  She is worldly while Marie is an Idealist.  She lives with Her Uncle &amp; Father &amp; is practically Housekeeper.  It must be a dreary life.  She has nothing in common with either it seems to me.  Both Her Father &amp; Uncle are good men, but what a life for Jennie.  She has been Housekeeper &amp; Mother to the whole lot of them since</p>
