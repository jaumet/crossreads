  
 estates & forests & farms of Bonnie England. This is indeed a good sight for the eyes. After a plentiful view of scenery I arrive at Liverpool 3-30 pm. A really beautiful day. Liverpool is a big place, but comparatively small after London. Station of arrival - Lime St. My impression of Liverpool is much the same as the impression I create walking along the street. The people here have evidently never seen Australians before; our uniform is so distinctive, especially the hat, that everybody gazes at me & this is decidedly uncomfortable. I took a train to the big landing stage of Ferry Boats & view the docks. This landing stage is a mile in length. Have lunch in a nice restaurant in the main street, take a long tram ride to a suburb, Aigburth, visit the soldier's club where I meet one Mr Hudson, a gentleman of importance in public matters who treats me well. After a decent walk around town, take the 11-10 pm train
