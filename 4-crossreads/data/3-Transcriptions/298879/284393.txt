<p>June 1915<br/>Saturday 19<br/><u>Fine</u> Money scarce otherwise I would be enjoying myself entirely. The paymaster has not turned up so far though.</p>
<p>Sunday 20<br/>Fine. Church parade for the patients. My chum from the 3rd Batt went back to the Peninsular today with many more chaps who have recovered from their illness. Feeling a bit depressed. Expect to be back myself in a couple of days</p>
