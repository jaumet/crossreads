Bert went away on 4 day's Leave and left Yank in charge of the Kitchen. Mrs Draper is going away too and another Lady is taking her Job over. Yank cooked a good dinner at night and things went off very well. To make matters more exciting the Painters are doing the place out and things are upside down.

Mrs Draper went away this morning. She gave me some candles before leaving, so I must be in her good books. Had a Bath in the afternoon.
