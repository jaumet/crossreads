  
 January 1915 at 9.30.  Orders came through to get up steam ready to go at 5.30am tomorrow. 
 Thursday 31st Orders came to stand by at 5.30am & to keep steam up.  Submarine A.E.2 is alongside the flag ship. However we didn't get away till about 9.  Found it quite smooth outside.  We were all glad to get away again.  It was a fine sight to see all the ships 17 in all in 3 lines.  New Years Eve.  Quietest I have ever put in.  Some of the chaps got a bit merry, but don't know where they got the liquor.
