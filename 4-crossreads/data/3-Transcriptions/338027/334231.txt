<p>Thursday, 26 August, 1915<br/>The search party that went out brought five of the men that were cut off, they were the only survivors, their condition was pitiful to all and their story worse to hear, they were brought into our hospital and given cocoa &amp; food, some were even past the hungry stage &amp; only eat rationally, the state of their wounds were awful fly blown &amp; stinking.</p>
<p>Three more reinforcements arrived to-day and best of all two big bags of mail from Aust, this is more acceptable than our night issue of Rum.  According to the Melb. papers there has been a Parliamentary Recruiting campaign &amp; it was a great success Victoria enlisted 11,000 in a month, the sooner they are here the better &amp; give some of the poor Austs a well earned spell.</p>
<p>Friday, 27 August, 1915<br/>I went over to Monash Gully &amp; Quinn's Post where the L.H. Bde are.  I was unduly surprised to hear full extent of 1st L.H. casualties.  About 4 p.m. a violent bombardment started by our navy &amp; artillery when this surged our left flank attacked and the fight continued all night we are waiting for news to come to hand a German Taube flew over us &amp; dropped bombs with little effect not far from us in the N.Z. Aust gully.  There is a paper published here called the Peninsular Press and it gives all the cable &amp; wireless news Germans are still pursuing the Russians, it is rumoured that they are trying to get troops through Bulgaria.</p>
