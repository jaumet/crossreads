If I return and sit at lastBeside some hearth-fire safe and sound,Maybe I'll send some tales aroundAbout our doings of the Past
Of stairs that twist from musty lanesWeird dens of sin with latticed doorsFierce gasping fights in corridorsSlave market walls with rusty stains.
Peach-colored dawns with opal mists,The snaky camel-train that steals,Past oxen plodding round the wheels,Gold bangles loading women's wrists.
The flash of anklets through the dustVeiled women round the village well(What dark eyes say no tongue may tellOf hate of hate, of lust of lust)
A hundred breeds of men that meetAnd strive with tales in broken speech,Sad tales of homes far out of reachBarbaric music weird and sweet
Huge tombs of priests and dust of kingsRising beneath our careless tread,While bristling kites swing overheadA thousand thousand wondrous things
Still heaps beneath the outspread flagThe wolf-like captives pleading eyeThe firing party plodding byQuiet heads beneath a bloody rag
Are heaps of clothes that clutch and sprawlAnd ghastly boys who fight for airOld twisted mouths, wide eyes that stareBlue skies and sunshine over all.
If I return to sit and weaveThese tales and watch the homefire burnWhen I return - if I returnDo you believe that they'll believe.
