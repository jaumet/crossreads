<p>enormous place.  Numbers of large rooms and passageways running deep into the earth, with two outlets is the nearest description.  Shells have apparently failed to pierce the inmost parts.  In here we were crowded out, as the place was full when we arrived.  Worked in two shifts of 6 hours off &amp; 6 hours on, 12 men &amp; an N.C.O. per shift.  When on duty we waited at the Medical Aid passageway, standing up all the time in this foul-aired compartment.</p>
