<p>drizzling rain fell all the time I was on guard, 6 to 8.  But as I stayed in the shed all the time I got practically none of it.  It is a winter day and in marked contrast to the beautiful day of yesterday.<br/>I have not seen any papers yesterday or this morning, &amp; have heard no war news at all.  Yesterday the Germans shell from a long way off one of the 4 observation balloons stationed around here but failed to hit it.  They succeeded in causing it to be drawn down.  As I have nothing to do when I came off guard, I removed my bed from the guard hut to the reinforcements huts, remade it and turned in for a rest if not a sleep.  A new guard was appointed but before they had taken over a detachment of Tommies from England, (conscripts) came into camp and took over all the guard duties of this camp.<br/>This afternoon I had a hot bath at the Divisional baths attached to this camp &ndash; I got my towel changed.  I heard today that the British had another big advance after hard fighting in the region of St. Quentin also that we lost 28 planes.</p>
