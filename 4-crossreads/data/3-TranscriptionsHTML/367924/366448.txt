<p>In Palestine<br/>April 14th 1918</p>
<p>Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines in answer to your welcome letters and was pleased to hear that you are both well as it leaves me at present. There should never be an Egyptean mail come in without some letters in it for you from me as I write regular. Well I was pleased to hear that Nell was over staying with you at last, I am afraid that Nell must be sick of wandering about. I can tell you you that I will be pleased to get home again.</p>
<p>Well I have had my leave at last and I have felt a good deal better for it, but I have a bad head to-day. Port Said is a very dirty place and the most of it is out of bounds to the troops.</p>
<p>I sent you a present from there I hope you will like it it is in with Nell's parcel, so you will have to go over and get it from her when you hear that the parcel arrives, get Nell to show you the vasses I sent her for her Birthday. I would have sent you one like it if I had, had the money as I think they are very nice. I have just bought three little broches I am sending them to you, one is for you, you can have your pick and I want you to give the other two to Nell when you see her. I am sending you a little card that I have just bought.</p>
<p>Well I was pleased to hear that you have got a good man at last, it is to be hoped that he stays there. I am pleased to hear that my horses are looking well</p>
