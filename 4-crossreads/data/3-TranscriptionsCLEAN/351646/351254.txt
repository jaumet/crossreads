The Tin Dish26.10.1914My dear Nell,It is now a long time -- & three mails -- since I have heard from or of your family; I have written you or Guy which I suppose is the same, what little information one is allowed to send these times each mail; I don&acute;t know if you get all my letters; I do know I&acute;m at least one mail adrift which is wandering about the face of the seas in an old tub now some days overdue. Hope the Sauerkrauts haven&acute;t bagged her. Come, now, Madam! I want to hear all about you alls yourselves & your two families & also others that we know in Sydney & how you are all getting on. We get papers & press news by the wireless, so that we know all thats published about the war the other side & a great deal more this. So that home news is all that&acute;s wanted & and that is very welcome. We are still behaving like lunatics in my own estimation; if the Germans believe, like the Indians, that ma people are sacred & must not be touched then we should be quite safe. If we had any likelihood of doing any good one wouldn&acute;t mind what happened, but as the Flagship keeps up a continual shriek on her wireless which is quite sufficient to warn off the Sauerkrauts within 500 miles of us I don&acute;t suppose we&acute;re likely to catch them unawares. She is known among the merchant shipping we meet as the German band. It sickens one to write or talk and every dream of her is nightmare. The penalty for mentioning her &acute;&acute;strategy&#148; at our mess has been fined at drinks all round &#151; & all but Willie has paid it!!We had a chase yesterday after a ship while we were on patrol & she gave us a good run; finally we dropped a proj. very much closer than we intended or than was comfortable &#151; and she hove to one time! she was one of our own of course, it added one more to our many dummy runs. Well, I&acute;d sooner have many dummy runs than miss the chances Big Ben & his satellites don&acute;t think worth while investigating,I expect you wonder at this continuous wail, or perhaps put it down to a constituional inability to be cheerful; if you ever hear the details of our acts of lunacy you will be somewhat annoyed yourself I expect. Not the least &#151; or perhaps it i_s the least, really &#151; annoying part is the compalcency with which that incarnation of self satisfaction &#151; the R.N. incompetent officer, the competent are otherwise -- compalcently attributes it all to the R.A.N. forgetting that we are under the Admiralty & R.N. senior officers. Ah well! the R.A.N. has struggled through many disabilities; it may get a decent chance when the German menace is done away with & the Pacific, as it will becomes one of the Empires biggest stations&#151; Australia, as she must, the Empires Strategic Eastern base. Then we might get live men to run it.By the way, I see the British Govt. has published a &acute;&acute;White Book&#148; embodying all the diplomatic Telegrams received and sent before the War. I believe it is a most interesting sixpenn&acute;orth. Get me one if you are getting any for afterwards.Well I suppose I&acute;d better makee finish. We are not allowed to give any definite information & one can&acute;t write letters without; not under present conditions anyhow as I get
