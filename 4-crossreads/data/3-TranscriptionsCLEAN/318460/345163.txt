Wednesday Wed 6/16letters from Nell & Jack also papers from Syd yesterday  Viv much better got his voice back again.  The Boys are being knocked about in the Trenches. [indecipherable] John had his two feet blown off got his knife out & cut one away  & applied a ligature himself then had to wait hours to be taken out.
Thursday 7/12/16Same old thing, no snow yet but cold enough for it. The Boys come out tomorrow night. Pay 2-0-9. deferred 17-10-0. Up to your waist in mud in the front line, can only go between support & front line at night. Grenadier Guards also 59th AIF marched out leaving wounded in dug outs one of the guards was rescued after 4 days this is dinkum. 59 Pioneers swear it is true they saw them.
Friday 8/12/162nd division has gone out reduced to 1800 how are they going to keep this up. Raining to day, had to shift to dug-outs, beautiful, have to give up our Posies to others coming in why couldnt they take the dug-outs, seeing its only for one night, but this Batallion is run by all the others in the Brigade for instance our Boys have done 8 days in front line & supports right off, no others have done this & its not that they are any more fit.The more I see of the Australians the more I am convinced that they are the most foul mouthed bragging, malingering crowd in this war all they think of is food, women, drink & to see who can curse the worst, my honest opinion is that they are mostly a damn lot of wastrels & cowards always talking of how to get to blighty or home & they expect to beat the huns with this material (I don't think.)  Pay 2-1-9, deferred 17-11-0   got sudden orders to Pack up & go another 2 miles towards the line 3 P.M. we are now at Delville Wood & the guns are going merrily, in dug-outs here about 4 ft high  & 5 ft long. Only here two days I think. Sergt. Livingstone ill again, think he will go to blighty, if so I get his Job, hope so.
Saturday 9/12/16On fatigue, our Boys came out last night & a lovely time they had, getting fixed up in these rat holes mud & slush up to your knees. Our dug out dripping water all night, found myself lying in a Pool of it about 3 am. wonderful how the Rheumatism keeps off.  Bread &night got some Pioneers 3 killed 4 wounded & 3 shell shock.Pay 2-2.9 deferred 17-12-0.Raining & miserable water dripping into the dug out.  Blankets, coat & everything, wet.  Had bread & milk for dinner.
