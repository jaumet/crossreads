<p>Monday, 26 February</p>
<p>Left at midday per motor ambulance for Bernafay Wood, ascertained from Divisional Hd. Quarters the whereabouts of the 56th.  Went there &amp; found that the position has been filled by a man from the Batt.  Good Luck for me because I don't like the idea of going to this unit.<br/>Interviewed the Field Cashier &amp; then returned to our own unit.</p>
