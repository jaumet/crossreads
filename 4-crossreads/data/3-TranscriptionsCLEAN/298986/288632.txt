boats crew for No. 3 life boat.  My job is to hang on to the rope at one end of the boat & lower it when we get wrecked.  Started about 2.30 on the trip that should have a joyful ending.  It was a very interesting harbour with many sorts of ships but did not seem to be a busy place.  The Warspite was berthed beside us with 2 planes for scouting they put a platform out along the big guns for them to get a start off.  All sorts of war
