They have got a nice church here I was in it for a while, it is amusing to watch the French people coming into church, they first all walk up to the "Holy water" then cross themselves when they get opposite the altar, they bend their knee right down, the place was full of little girls most of them were praying a few were saying "confession" in their little boxes.
Any amount of women barbers at work here, it seems funny to watch them Saw Captain Jackson Lieut. Beckett this evening they have just come back from England
On the way down we saw a pretty sight 2 aeroplanes starting off for their flight, they work up a great pace before they leave the ground
