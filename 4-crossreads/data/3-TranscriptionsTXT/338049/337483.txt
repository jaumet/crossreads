wagon & laid line to Bde amidst machine gun fire. Had a lucky escape from Mills bomb which exploded 3 yds in front of me. Horse wounded 2 places, King & Maroney got pieces also. Returned to safe place with all hacks but Maroney got a piece shell in the ear, burst a bit in front & he got another piece in the leg. Waited hours & hours for orders to go forward again but finally ordered home about 5 p.m. Nothing to eat (no breakfast) until 4 p.m.
Advance not too good today mainly on account of Yanks not mopping up & Fritz working through tunnels not mopped up. Hard luck. Wagon did very good - getting very far forward. My horse Maroney evacuated. King back to Roisel for a rest. Camp prepared by Chancellor.
