 24/ Have been yarning to the little crippled priest of Lille  - He killed seven as a Franc-tireur & then escaped through the lines. Things he told me of the occupied country were pretty rotten.                                                                              Made me somehow think of that Calvary at Thiembronne Hill; and that little Prussian officer after all was one of the responsible heads if he was only a kid, Never make a soldier  Haven't got the guts to be a man killer                What a damn funny thing Human nature is after all
