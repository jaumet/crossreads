<p>After the performance we went &amp; had a dinner at "Simpsons" &amp; then down the Strand to Charing Cross tube station we got a proper shock here for the whole street was simply a mass of surging swaying mass of people all struggling to get down to the trains, this is a very busy little spot at any time but I never saw anything like this before you were fairly carried off your feet it's a wonder someone was not crushed to death.  I'm hanged if I know how girls get on for I nearly had my ribs stove in they used to let so many hundreds in at a time &amp; then close the gates till the platforms &amp; subways were clear, eventually we got carried along with the crush &amp; squeezed in to the Inner Circle tube &amp; soon were in Liverpool St. &amp; out home again.</p>
<p>6th.  Got up fairly late this morning on account of it being Sunday in the afternoon I ran back to London &amp; went out to Plumstead</p>
