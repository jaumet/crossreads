Seems extraordinary the time these chaps are kept hanging round base camps but I suppose it's the old story, if a man does his job there & makes himself useful, he will be only parted with by under protest by the commandants of these Camps. Billy Watson was also down here with Les - He looks very well & keen to get his "baptism" over, but he seems changed in some way or other. Not so rollicking as he used to be - 
 I think I told you my majority has now been confirmed, and the cable you got from Ted giving you the news was the one I said I was sending from here - just at the time, cable communication was suspended from here, so I wrote and asked Ted to send it for me -
