<p>our Washing Day. The Boat has square tubs fixed under the Wash Basins, which are lifted up Frame and all &amp; hooked on to a Frame in the Wall &amp; there is about 30 of them so when all are in use things are busy. There were lines supplied <strike>at</strike> right Aft on Top but these were not enough so a lot of us had to use parts of the rigging, also it is necessary to sit &amp; watch ones Clothes while they are drying otherwise they are liable to be Stolen, it was amusing to see all of us sitting down reading &amp; keeping a Watch. I had my all dried about 2 Pm. Had Roast Beef, Potatoes &amp; Peas for Dinner &amp; had a look at the Pillow Fight in the Afternoon which was amusing. A Pole <strike>was</strike> 1 ft</p>
