<p>&#39;Tis indeed a sombre ruin, the place you once called Home</p>
<p>Alas, theres many suchlike on the main road to <u>Bapaume</u></p>
<p>What once was smiling country side is now a blasted plain</p>
<p>Given o&#39;er to Crows &amp; rats &amp; human moles who bring misery in their train</p>
<p>So little [????], a fond adieu, I&#39;ve loitered more than seemly</p>
<p>Some day will come the reckoning &amp; the score will blot out cleanly</p>
<p>Thus moralising do I pass, a soldier from Australia</p>
