 More lectures on how to win the war. Our instructors are men who have been through the MILL in France. It would cost a man about 100/-/- to go through a Cavalry School like this in Australia as  a volunteer yet some Officers waste their time in a drunken stupor. If I could I should like to keep up soldiering "apres la guerre". . This School teaches one all the up to date schemes learnt from sad experience in France & elsewhere.
