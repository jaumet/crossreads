<p>Saturday Nov 17th<br/>Much better today. Cape Otway was sighted just after dinner. Victorians, S.  Australians &amp; Tasmanians are all getting ready to go off tomorrow, We are expecting to be in Melbourne tomorrow morning. It remains a mystery whether we N.S.Welshmen are to go overland from Melbourne, or by boat. Concert held on No 3 hatchway this evening. It was very good, &amp; the bunting was splendid.</p>
<p>Sunday Nov 18th<br/>We went through the Port Phillip Heads about 6 am. Of course everybody was up by that time. Some had been up since 2 am. Great excitement on board. Arrived in Port Melbourne about 8 am. The quarantine Doctor came on board &amp; examined us all. Apparantly we came in a day before our time as the Dr said we were not expected until tomorrow.</p>
<p>All the Victorians, S. Australians &amp; Tasmanians were preparing to go off all the morning. Pulled into the wharf just at dinner time. Great was our surprise when we (N. S. Welshmen &amp; Queenslanders) received half an hours notice to hand in all our thing &amp; be prepared to disembark straight away. I was mess orderly, but we <strike>left</strike>  let all the cleaning up rip when the above order came out.</p>
