<p>Salmon, biscuits, sauce &amp; lollies plus 2 big parcels I received from home. Most of the other things were out of A.M.C. "Comforts".<br/>In the afternoon we had an enjoyable sports meeting followed by a first class banquet. There was a great deal left over &amp; this was given to hospital patients. The day was a wonderful success.</p>
<p>26th April (Wednesday) Hottest day since we arrived here. Put door on cookhouse &amp; attended lecture in morning. Too hot to do anything in the afternoon.</p>
