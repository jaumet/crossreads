Sunday church parade at 11 a.m. went off well the men looking smart. Afterwards had a march past ? they swing past in style to the band's music. Earlier had taken the salute from the Roman Catholics who had been to mass in the local church. Horse was waiting so rode straight up to Bde H.Q. at Wardrecques there meeting all the other Battalion commanders and getting full particulars of F.M. Haigs inspection on Wednesday next. After that we adjourned to a very recherche lunch and what with sherry and bitters, gin and vermouth and liquers one had to go slow to avoid getting inked. Returned to and spent the afternoon in billets our band playing a programme which served to pass the time away. After mess had the O.C. Coys up and passed the orders on to them. Some Australian mail arrived today. Heavy rain set in after dark and will be bad for the crop.
