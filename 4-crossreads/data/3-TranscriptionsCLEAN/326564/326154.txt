  
 things must be very bad in Germany for them to attempt this mad act. I expect they are driven to it & have staked all they have got on this final plunge, no doubt they will make things hum & be very nasty for a while but the issue should never be in doubt, everyone over here have the greatest confidence as to the eventual result of the offensive & its just the very thing that we have been wanting him to do, let him do the bag hopping by all means & when he is sick of it we will take a hand in the fun, he is now having a taste of what we had to put up with all last summer & good luck to him & his storm troops this should be the beginning of the end & France will be a good place to be out of during the next 6 or 8 months for there will be plenty of stouch & etc.
