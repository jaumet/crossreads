the A.D.M.S. staff in Cairo & expected to be made Major.Capt Reiach was out to Mena. Joyce Stobo really did so very well. What clever youngsters they are. I certainly think the Owen girls were not given a fair chance. The trouble was Mr Owen does not seem to think the poor girls matter. Poor Gwen! she is a good child & likes writes often to me. Her letters are just frightful, in Composition etc. The moonstones were for Myfannny.Fancy that silly woman smuggling the dogs on board.Just received a letter from Aunt Mary. Well dear old girl I have no news so au-revoirMuch love to you all.Your loving brotherFred
