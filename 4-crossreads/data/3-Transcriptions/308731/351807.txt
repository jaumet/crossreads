<p>Dear Old Daddy.</p>
<p>I hope you like being there.  I sospose it is not like any of the Australian Hospital's in England.  Now I am over at Aunt Jane.  Mum said to be sure to put care of Aunt Jane.  I hope you will be able to come home soon.  I found that naclace in one of your socks; Frank found that what you did, <strike>and</strike> it is the Rising Sun you did do it so nicely, I think mum said she was going to that one with the Blue.  Much love <strike>fo</strike> from<br/>Ruth Burrowes.<br/>xxx etc. ooo etc.</p>
