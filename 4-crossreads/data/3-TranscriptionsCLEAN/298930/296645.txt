I stood in, but later on, two small blankets were served out.
We were marched every day, Sundays included, to work on barges and sand-hills.   It was our duty to throw sand or gravel from the barge to a platform on a line with the top of the deck, four men were usually placed in the barge to throw the sand on to the first platform, built of planks with a steel plate, and two men would throw it from the platform to the wharf, and the sand shovelled into a small truck by three prisoners who would then convey it to other prisoners about 100 yards away.   Each truck was met by two prisoners who would then throw the sand, after being tipped on to the side of the line, to two other men who had to seeit was kept clear of the line.
