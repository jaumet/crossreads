<p>1917 Monday 26 March</p>
<p>The service of last evening was very simple &amp; sincere. Ptes. Clarke &amp; Crowden conducted &amp; spoke well &amp; feelingly of him whom we all honoured &amp; admired in life &amp; now in death mourned a true &amp; loyal comrade gone from our ken. <br/>Had a short stroll this afternoon gathered a few ivy leaves from the moss covered boles of some shattered trees in Becourt Wood. Cold, rainy &amp; snowing again today.</p>
