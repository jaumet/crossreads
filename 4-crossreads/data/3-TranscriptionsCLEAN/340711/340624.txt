  
 Friday, 14. B. Sub tip top. Though the responsibility is now over, I feel the reaction of the old Sub. However, in a few days I will be fit and the neuralgia will disappear. Stables and exercising horses as usual. Still wet---slush, spongy and sloppy everywhere. Boots wet through. 
 Saturday, 15. Harness cleaning---holiday afternoon. 
 Sunday, 16. Work as usual. Wet as usual. 
 Monday, 17. Wet and sloppy underground and still raining. The humpies are damnably stuffy and evil smelling. Each day in spite of the weather we exercise the horses. I am to take Horse Picquet tonight and sleep in the saddlery barn. It is a cruel night. Hay nets to be untied filled, tied on again and then untied again. 
 Tuesday, 18. Slept well and feeling fit this morning. Left for Brigade Headquarters at 7.30 and arrived there at 8.pm. Had to wait a couple of hours. Went to the La Petite Chaumiere de Lerouge in the evening. 
 Wednesday, 19. Took a wagon out to 18th. Battery in afternoon. Spent evening at La Petite Chaumiere de Lerouge. 
 Thursday, 20. Still wet. Went with Mr Lewis to Bailleul---and managed to do a bit of shopping. He owes me 6 1/2 francs for a lamp for the Officers' Mess. 
 Friday, 21. (Good Friday) No different to any other day as far as our work is concerned.
