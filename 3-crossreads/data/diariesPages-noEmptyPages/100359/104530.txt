To the enlivening strains of the Band the column moved off at about twenty minutes to seven. What a difference the Band makes to a march, the crowd stepped out like veterans and looked fit to march any where, but, oh, what a contrast to our arrival at Moaska, our second stop. Quite a number of men dropped out even in the first mile with sore feet, and generally knocked up and as the day wore on and it got hotter and hotter and the water bottles got empty, they were dropping out by scores and were scattered all over the desert. After each spell the band struckup its liveliest tunes, but music won't heal a man's sore feet, or quench his thirst and they continued to drop out faster and faster. We were sent out in squads again and did the best we could but our supply of water was very limited,, and we could not do much. The horses in the waggons were getting knocked up, too, so the wagon orderlies got orders to carry the mens packs for a mile and then put them off. Talk about being hot, I have experienced some hot days in Australia, but here with the sun beating down on the sand, and the flies biting us, it was enough to make one demented. The spell for dinner was very welcome and our squad just flopped down in the shade of a waggon, with our tongues hanging out. The force had by this time lost about a third of its number. I felt sorry for the poor beggars out there in the desert, with no shade of any description. It was a great relief to take off our clothes and have a rub down with a towel, to get rid of the stale perspiration.
