21.9.15Tues 21stI had a swim this morning while down for water I believe despatch riding along the beach has been given up on account of the number of horses hit & the danger the rider runs The new moon has been showing for several nights now & it is getting bright enough to see the transports by & where the Turks could only fire at the sound a few nights ago they can now see their target they get an occasional mule & sometimes wound an Indian driver ot two; Mills has to go along this road with the Indians every night as interpreter; The nights are getting quite chilly here now but the days are still warm; Nothing doing in the fighting line; Nelson & one of his men are to run out a telephone wire tonight they go out over the parapet with it.
