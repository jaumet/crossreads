<p>that the Military leaders on both sides expect during the Months of may or June to fight battles which will give advantage.   The side that gains it must profit much by the success.  As you know my great respect for the German weight and training, you can easily imagine that my mind is not quite confident as to the result whether it be in France or the Dardanelles.  In this last place, I should not be surprised if the task set our men has not been too great.   However they must ultimately worry through.   This is the British way.  The German way is exactly otherwise, as the Teuton leaves almost nothing to chance having weighed the pros and cons and the side issues that may be to others entirely unexpected.   The Australians at Gallipoli were guilty of all the acts which bespeak the novice, no fear, rapid advance, far beyond the point of controll, shooting bayonetting German or Turk.  No quarter was asked by either side, the bullet and the bayonet were launched on their deadly missions, we know some of the effect upon the Australians, we have been told about what happened to the enemy, but to how great extent he paid his tribute in dead &amp; wounded is indefinite to high degree.</p>
