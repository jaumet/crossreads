<p>Thursday 21 Sept. 1916<br/>Fairly fine but very wet underfoot after last night's rain. In the morning lectured at the 2nd Bn. &amp; after lunch, as there was only  an inspection of the units by General Plummer, went into Poperinghe to the pictures. Missed seeing Leo through being a little later that arranged but saw him afterwards &amp; rode home with him. The pictures were quite a change &amp; I enjoyed them much.</p>
