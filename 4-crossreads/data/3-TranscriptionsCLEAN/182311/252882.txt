curious existence this military one and each chap in the A.I.F. plays many parts in doing his daily work.  Oh yes, and there are baths , just across the road where A.Coy will bathe tomorrow.  Good little baths too, there are showers and though the flow of water is not large one can get clean and also a washed (not clean) set of underclothing, it may be verminous but is usually better than the one handed in, thank goodness I can carry a couple of spare sets and send them back to the French to wash.
   On the 24th I am off to the Tommies again for about a week to assist in the preparation of a raid, rather a compliment eh, to be asked for again and it is nearly twelve months since the last time I was with them.
   Just now I am living at the transport lines and as I had a bit of a cough and was losing my voice, so the dear old Major sent me away from the underground ^for three days hol-iday, no job and no responsibility he told me, and here I am, just on top of that comes the invitation of the Tommies so it never rains but it pours.
   Best wishes from,
 
      HAROLD.
