Sunday when one ought to be well out of the Camp.
These sandbaggers are getting to work round here again, the other night they killed an officer in one of the little quiet roads leading from Warminster to the Camp there have been several more case's of cracked heads, I reckon they should make an example of the first one they catch shoot him publicly before the whole of the Camps make a big event out of it, the rest of them would not be so keen on it then I'll bet.
Got a parcel yesterday from the Wagga Comfort Fund Miss Duke is responsible for this, shes not a bad sort.
9th Been raining fairly heavy on off the whole day, I was to have had a nerve out but my dentist "Charlie Chaplin" as the boys call him had an abscess in his mouth
