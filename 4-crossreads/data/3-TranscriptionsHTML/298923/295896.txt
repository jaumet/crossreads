<p>18 August 1918  Sunday   Enab. (X to X crossed out)<br/>Arrived Enab 12 noon- &amp; camped near Vineyard X hard work to keep men from looting grapes, Melons etc:- one feels knowing what is in front in the Jordan Valley that they should eat all they can but we British are so particular in enemy occupied country- X Bedouins rob us, but we must not even take a bit of wood.  The Camel men complain they find Cavalry life harder, too much going to Water, cannot carry same quantity of Kit &amp; have no "Firewood" supplied by their mount-  You know Camel dung will cook anything.</p>
