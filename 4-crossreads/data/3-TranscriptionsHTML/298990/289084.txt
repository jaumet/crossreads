<p>In Action. Flers 21/11/16  Got a little sleep after 11pm but was not allowed to slumber long without some interruptions.  The situation continued fairly quiet but just before dawn Fritz went quite mad evidently anticipating an attack.  He sent up many signals to his guns and put up a heavy barrage behind us pumping hard also into the unfortunate ridge.  The morning was frosty and the mud positively as tenacious as glue.  Flares fell well over us, one nearly dropped on our dugout here. No more digging was done last night on the little trench commencing last night and I do not propose to start any tonight either in view of our relief.  Rations appear good and all satisfied today.  Am sending Lieut Rigby out in charge of our guides to lead in the new people.  The glimpse got from our trenches towards Bapaume is a very pleasant one &ndash; nice green fields and pastures delight the eye.  Much different to the desolate waste behind us.  Furphey that our heavies have knocked down the clock tower.  Sig jargon.." [indecipherable]emma e.as pip emms 10 words 20th three[indecipherable].  Our bombing post spotted 3 enemy snipers who had crawled out from their trench during the night.  They were only a few yards from our men whose presence they did not realise.  Arranged to let the post withdraw a few yards at dark and then drop some bombs on them.  We heard that Fritz had been seen moving along a road a half mile or so in rear of their trenches.  As a thick fog was on we surmised there would be a fair amount of traffic there and got our batteries on to it.  They will tickle this spot up during today.  Quite a feast this morning &ndash; some petit- beurre biscuits and cold cocoa and the English papers for the 17th.  Not having had clothes off for some days now I feel very crumby.  Another liaison officer arrived to relieve our friend Hart and it amused our Australian "dags" to hear the affectation of their speech.  You can make no greater mistake than to despise a man as a nincompoop for these little national characteristics so different to ours.  Very often</p>
