<p>12/9/17 Steenvoorde <br/>a couple of miles out of the town and just on the border of Belgium.  The mens' feet were inspected by the officers and found clean and fairly free from blisters considering they have marched over 20 miles since breakfast today &ndash; a long way.  They marched excellently full packs up.  My quarters are at a large farmhouse which is also an estaminet and the men sit round the kitchen drinking beer.  We have some good bedrooms and a mess.  The officers mess is temporarily dissolved and company messes are again the rule.  In the household are some buxom mademoiselles who speak Walloon, French and some English.  One brought us black coffee in bowls, beet lump sugar and milk.  We also got some French white tipped sulphur matches rather rare things these days.  On the march assembled the company commanders &amp; handed on all I know about the march tomorrow.  7.00 is supposed to be start time.</p>
