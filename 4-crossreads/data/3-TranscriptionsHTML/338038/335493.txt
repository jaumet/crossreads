<p>Garfield St.<br/>Five Dock<br/>22.5.18</p>
<p>Dear Mr Garling<br/>In your letter of 17.5.18, you asked permission to use my name in connection with the life story of my late O.C.  I have not the slightest objection for I feel sure that nothing too  grand can be said of him.  The Boys at the Battery will miss him as much as a man misses a right arm. I was with the Battery 18 months in France, the 1st Engagement your son took charge in was Bullencourt &amp; this I give you as confidential "that men were very much put out to think the major did not get honoured out of it for he worked unceasingly for over 28 days" yet I suppose we in the ranks must not criticise</p>
