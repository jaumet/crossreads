 France 16 August 
 Dear Mrs. John, 
 Of course I've missed the mail &amp; am dead sorry but I have been so rushed the past few days that I simply haven't been able to settle to write letters.  I simply hate having a big job on my mind &amp; while I hate starting it, I simply can't do anything else except perhaps  nothing . 
 Anyhow now I think I have the main things done &amp; I'm sitting out side my  office  &amp; official residence (built of ammunition boxes &amp; roofed with sort of hessian that lets the rain through in a beautifully fine spray) watching the mules having kicking competitions.  They are brutes of things &amp; I hate them, the row they kick up.  In fact I'm not loving things at all today.  Its one of my very bad days, the weather is being rotten, showery &amp; windy &amp; cold &amp; my papers flutter &amp; the ink pencil runs over the paper &amp; my particular pals have just left &amp; consequently I'm hating things.  The flies are stupid &amp; sticky &amp; will persist in refuging here.  But enough of troubles &amp; worries.  I suppose we should be glad
