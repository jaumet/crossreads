2/12/17 Mt. Kemmell
The first snow of the season was lying on the grass in patches and on the duckboards this morning. The sun was bright but powerless and the wind biting so I ordered greatcoats for church parade conducted by Padre Lamble. He came up to the top of Mt Kemmell with Cawthorne and myself and we could see the Channel plainly but Lille was in mist. The flat country stretching for miles below is covered with camps. The bursts of odd shells could be seen and also the good country in rear of the German lines. How many good men of British German races lie dead in this vast plain. Read wrote all the afternoon getting very black from a smutty brazier. HJSmith was our guest at mess. Afterwards there was a battalion concert run by Pte. Larry Herz with scenery well painted out of salvaged stuff by Merson. An excellent tenor in [indecipherable] of an English labour company.
