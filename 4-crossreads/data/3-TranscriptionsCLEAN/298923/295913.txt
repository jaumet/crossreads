There are Bulbs here that send up strait stalks 6 inches in a single night, growing to a height of 2 to 3 feet then flowering into a white wax string of Bells- very pretty.  Jim Ayre has dug some up to send to Australia. Did I tell you BANANAS grow along the Wadi here & maiden fern? with Snakes & trout in the Water?
