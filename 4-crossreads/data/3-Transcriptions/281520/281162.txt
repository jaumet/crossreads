<p>Tent Camp near Le Barque <br/>21/3/17<br/>Some snow fell during morning. [indecipherable] wind and deep black clouds. <br/>The men at work digging drains running down each line of tents.  Walked with Colonel over to Le Barque enormous quantity of good timber appears to be used by the enemy everywhere.  Many nose caps and dud shells lying about.  Visited the 21st Battn. Crowther seemed cold miserable and upset so sent him down some coal and blankets.  They had very rough experiences and describe the m.g. fire as wonderful.  We seem to have trodden so closely on their heels as to compel them to fight and they gave us all we wanted.  Our men could see them going out in trains.</p>
<p>In camp here today all hands working with a will have effected great improvements.  Deep trenched drains run the whole length and duckboards and timber carried from Le Sars have been laid everywhere.  Most of the tents now have wooden floors, each man doing a bit.  Col. Davis still unwell.  The Dr &amp; myself have decided to once more attempt French together &ndash; another good resolution.  During the evening flares of all kinds were being fired up &amp; bombs let off by 'tags'.</p>
