July 1917of heavy bridge calculated to carry 12 tons with safety.In the afternoon we had played a holiday the 14th F.C. football (Australian Rules) but unfortunately lost.   At about 1 PM to-day the 5th Div. Pioneer Battalion came into Corbie & took up their billets here, probably in order to take a course in Pontoon bridging, which I understand, General Hobbs has advised    Very heavy rain fell during the night accompanied by heavy thunder & lightning.8th   Sunday   After the 9 o'clock parade this morning we were free for the rest of the day.   I had a glorious feed of cherries this afternoon.
