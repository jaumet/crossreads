  
 Fired about 50 shots. Some were dangerously close, others miles off. The detail as regards our moving is out. I was at the Battery yesterday. I am detailed to remain here with 20 men. Only 12 horses to go to Anzac, and they are 1st Battery. Later orders just recieved , postponed indefinately. A despute between the heads. The Division that we are attached to, don't want us to go, but our General wants his division to be altogether, so things are at a standstill. Those three men that left Alexandria and come over here, were made prisoners at large, with defaulters drill and fatigues work. Two hours drill and three hours fatigue work each day, by orders of the C.O. The Prince Louie, French Battleship bombarding the Asiatic coast this evening.
