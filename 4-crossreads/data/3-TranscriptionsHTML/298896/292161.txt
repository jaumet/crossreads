<p>Towards evening had a stroll round a wood close by in which the hun had had a large calibre battery, a fair quantity of ammunition was still lying about.</p>
<p>Monday 9th Sept. Visited the 8th.&amp;did some reading of Charles Lamb essays during the morning. Afternoon walked to "Bouvincourt &amp; Estrees",5 miles walk very interesting, visited enemy dumps, aerodromes etc etc &amp; picked up a couple of souvenirs. Our division moving out today, we will probably go to-morrow, in the meantime we are having a splendid rest. Mail from Aussie in to-day.</p>
<p>Tuesday 10th. Sept. Heavy rain all night. At 9 oclock we marched out in fairly heavy rain to Mesnil near the river about 5K. we were properly wet when we reached our destination. After dinner had orders to dig in so decided to make a dugout large enough for three, the W.o.Sgt of A section &amp; myself. Our first job was to collect iron &amp; materials, a big job as we had to carry it some distance from neighbouring trenches</p>
