<p>Sunday 30th April<br/>At Suez. Caught the 9.30 P.M. Saturday night for Suez in company with Staff Ramsay of the 1st A.S.H. Through being asleep we were carried on to Port Tewfik &amp; had some difficulty in finding a bed for the night.  Hotel Sinai proved full so we found quarters at the Savoy a third rate show charging 20 P.T. for bed &amp; P.T. 8 for breakfast.  We hired a lorry &amp; drove to Suez where I had to locate the grave of a young chap named Jones who died &amp; was buried there.  This done we did the town, a very poor sort of place so returned to Port Tewfik for the afternoon a place of principally European quarters.  Arrived back at Ismailia about 8.30 P.M. &amp; camp an hour later. Managed to take several photos of different things.</p>
