<p>May 1915<br/>Sunday 30<br/>Fine   Cooked some bacon &amp; fried some biscuits and had a good breakfast which we finished up on marmalade, (Pte Jones &amp; I.)<br/>Beautifully calm and peaceful. It seems a pity that war should ever reach these parts. An occasional shot from a sniper reminds us that we are at war. Today ended with our guns bombarding the Turks Trenches forcing them to shift out. The Turks lost heavily.</p>
<p>Monday 31<br/>Fine hot day. Very quiet day. We kept enemy snipers quiet by continuously shooting at his loopholes. Many chaps returned who were wounded the first day (Sun 25th April.)  Our platoon <strike>are</strike> is acting as supports to the firing line to-night.</p>
