  
 October, 1915 Wednesday 20 Left Alex:- at midday in company with another Transport - beautiful, calm As soon as the men were settled I went to writing room & scribbled some letters [indecipherable] them on to the wharf for the People to post I hope they are delivered.  Much "grog" has been drunk by the men & some make [indecipherable] fools of themselves.  Thank goodness I'm off to the front again, instead of  Light Duties  Egypt as so many wounded men get - Good bed - Good Bath - Good Tucker - when will we see such comfort again.
