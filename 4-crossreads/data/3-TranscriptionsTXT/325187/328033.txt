[Tuesday 17 October 1916]
Laura & I went to Walsall to meet Major Brace a friend of Dollys.  Sleeping at the Hotel while I'm away.  Brace is bloated, fat, & drinks too much whisky-   I do not think he will live to be an old man-   Laura is afraid of him.I return tomorrow.Brace is Recruiting Officer here & draws a Major's Pay-  He never mentioned the son in law or anyone, Laura is much happier living by herself in London she is a slave when with him-Young Charlie has made his will.
