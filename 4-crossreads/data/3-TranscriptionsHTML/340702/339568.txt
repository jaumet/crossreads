<p>2/8  The 5th Div have come out for a few days (10). They have been in the line practically continuously since january. Speaking to one of them. He told me of two rather funny incidents. In one case a chap was carrying a bag of flares over in a Stunt when the bag was struck by an Enemy flare <strike>and</strike> which ignited most of the Flares it contained. The Aussie went for his life, looking like a mobile volcano belching out Red, Green &amp; white, Stars everywhere. Every Fritz that was not otherwise engaged, had a shot at him but he got back O.K. I believe it was in the same Stunt that a runner was sent to see if the troops had attained their objective. The runner went to the objective (a certain trench) got up on the parapet &amp; innocently enquired "Any Aussies there"? Bang Whizz. Bang, etc was the answer. The Trench was full of Fritzs. The Runner justified his name then if he never did before &amp; escaped Scatheless</p>
<p>4/8 Sunday  "Smart Set" last night &amp; there met Jacobs who recognised me immediately Although younger than I am His temples are nearly snow white &amp; he looks 25 years older than when I last seen Him about a dozen years ago. On comparing notes we discovered that we were on leave in Paris together. Were at the same theatres on the same night &amp; left Paris on the same day &amp; yet we never met each other. He was with McRae when the latter earned the D.C.M. &amp; says that Mac. fully deserved it for his coolness &amp; courage.</p>
