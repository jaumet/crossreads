Tuesday 25 March 1919Got up today. Too cold in bed.  Leg improving. Got 5 letters & answered them. Went for a stroll (about 150). Very cold today. Voice is still gone. Am going back to my unit in a day or so. Was told today Three new officers have come down here for duty so it relieves us. Do me.
Wednesday 26 March 1919Went to Mountivilliers. Wrote letters & played Gutzers & Rummy. Had an offer today of going to Blighty tomorrow & Aussie on the p.t. Turned it down Cos I want 6 months in Blighty first. Can get Aussie then.  Quite easily.
