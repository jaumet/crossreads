<p>about 8 miles away, near Peronne. Every one was delighted at the thought that we were going to leave Fritz along for a while &amp; have a few days spell. We were taken to a comfortable shanty &amp; had good diggings for the night. We were indeed most fortunate as the poor chaps in the Infantry had to build their own sleeping quarters. A hot meal was obtained about 7 p.m. &amp; "believe me" it was enjoyed.  The atmosphere was rather warm during the evening, at Mr Fritz welcomed the village with a few bombs, luckily no damage was executed in our village.</p>
<p>11th September 1918 - 21st September 1918.<br/>All the bearers, at the different Battalions received orders today, to return to the Ambulances. Naturally this order was appreciated as there is no place like your own Unit &ndash; our <u>Home</u>. After enjoying the luxury of a hot bath &amp; a good hot mea,l our squad started on the road again, &amp; eventually arrived at our Unit at 4 p.m. They were situated in a small wood about 4 kilos away from Les Mesnil, &amp; living in shanties &amp; dugouts. It was rather a pretty little spot, &amp; a few days rest here will be much appreciated by all the members of the Unit. The next couple of days all hands are hard at work, making the camp respectable &amp; comfortable.  You have no idea the state that the enemy leaves the country in, when he retreats &amp;</p>
