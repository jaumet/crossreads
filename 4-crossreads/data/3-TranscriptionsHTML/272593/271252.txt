<p>Today I read an account of the glowing way in which the Australians are being treated in their billets, one article describes us as sitting around huge roaring fires of wood with our clothes pegged out on the walls &amp; the men enjoying themselves with jokes cards &amp; etc, shows what he knows about it &amp; the other average billets we camp in, but I suppose that the public fondly believe it, &amp; reckon we are having a fine time in spite of the winter in France.<br/>This afternoon we all tested our new helmets with real gas,  this is how they test them  first of all the platoon Sergts inspect all their helmets to see that there are no defects in them &amp; the men understand how to breathe properly in them &amp; also that they fit</p>
