<p>3<br/>how we <strike>will</strike> would get on without the sheepskins. I am wondering what has happened to all the parcels you say are coming to me. I have only so far had one parcel from Australia &ndash; a tin of lollies from Margery Anderson. Mrs Magnus says she has sent two, &amp; you say the same. Sed sunt inventi. I'm, longing for some sox, good knitted ones, do send some. Both Jean &amp; Mr &amp; Mrs Anderson have both sent an Xmas fift, and I also got a parcel handed to me in the very trenches</p>
