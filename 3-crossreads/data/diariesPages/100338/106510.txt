one part of it which is about 400 yards long is fit for bathing as the rest of the beach is all shingles.

There is no surf whatever, the water is very smooth when there is no wind blowing it’s almost as smooth as glass.

They have a nice promenade which follows the beach almost all round, It will be very nice to come down here of an evening. I will get some views of the prettiest places for a souvenir.

I also visited Portland harbour which is next to Weymouth but not as pretty, Portland harbour has a large breakwater built across the entrance to break the force of the rough seas, and make it a safe anchorage for the Men-o-war.

At night I went to what is called the stiff’s opera, but is in reality the Y.M.C.A free picture show.
