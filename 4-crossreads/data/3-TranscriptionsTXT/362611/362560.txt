 [University of Sydney Letterhead with official crest in left hand corner] Date, 30/1/1917 Memorandum from the Professor of Agriculture   To  A 1.2.17  JW 
 Dear Mr Waterhouse. 
 I am greatly indebted to you for your letter of even date enclosing 2 type-written accounts of Walter's experiences at Pozieres.  I have read the latter again with the very greatest of interest and admiration for the splendid qualities of your son of whom you must all be so proud. I noticed from the Press that Walter has been wounded but understood from his brothers that the wounds were not serious. It now appears that he was more seriously injured than I had imagined;  but one good result is that he will be out again so soon, when I hope he'll find time to come and see me at the University. 
 I herewith return your son-in-law's letter which is another wonderful record of cheeriness under very trying circumstances. 
 Walter's document is exactly the kind of thing that is wanted for the Union Archives and I propose to hand over one copy to the Editor of these within the next few days unless I hear to the contrary. May I be permitted to share with you a tiny part of the honour of being connected with an officer who has shown such admirable spirit and such magnificent qualities as Walter?  On reading his modestly worded letter I again swelled with pride that I had any connection (however slight) with him at all. 
 Yours sincerely Robt D Watt
