12/2/19 Marcinelle
cooking smells and the usual unwashedness. Wandered round the slippery streets after mess and there were not a great lot of people about. Cinema shows took the attention of a good many.
13/2/19
Another good fine day. Had only a parade for inspection this morning and then let the men break off. Went round all the billets accompanied by the General for part of the distance. On the whole I think that the 23rd are housed the best part of them in an old hospital. After lunch went up the streets of Charleroi and being market day there were good crowds of people about. Little K. Sutherland leaves here today for England.
