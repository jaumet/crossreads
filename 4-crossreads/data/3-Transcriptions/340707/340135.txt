<p>I meet Henstridge who cannot get a machine &amp; as an alternative shows me all the different types of planes Snipe &ndash; Bristol &ndash; Kitten etc. &amp; then as Mayor has gone he gets an Avro out &amp; up we go I am not least frightened of accident to machine for his life is equally as dear to him as mine is to me &amp; he is not going</p>
