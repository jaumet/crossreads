[September 1916]
Sept 23rd Great excitement ion London to night. Zeppelins reported to be hovering over the City. All Trains and Trams running with lights out. City almost in darkness. About 10.15P.M. one of the Searchlights picked up a large Airship, it looked very uncanny glideingthrough space at such a great height, it looked like silver in the rays of thesearchlight. Anti-aircraft guns soon got to work and shells were seen to explode near her, then the Airship went higher up. All searchlight were turned off. The streets were crowded with excited women and children.
(24) About 1.20A.M. the searchlights were busy again, and located another Zeppelin, Bombs being dropped by other Zeppelins in various parts of the City, and what a din they made, several fell near Stratham Station and done considerable damage. The German dropped several Parachute flares to light up parts of the City, no doubt to pick their way out. About 1.30A.M. there was a burst of flame high up in the air away over near Woolwich, it got bigger and bigger until the whole length of the Zeppelin was in flames and was crashing to the earth, one of our aeroplanes had flown over her and destroyed her. There was mad cheering from the people as she came down. It was a grand sight.
(27) A large body of Australian Troops were marched form Perham Downs Camp to Bullford this afternoon, to be inspected by King George, it was a splendid turnout, and the boys looked their very best.
(29) About 20 men, myself included, took our departure form Perham Down this morning for "Aymsbury" about 35 miles off. Were then marched to "Rollestone Camp" about 9 miles further on. We passed by the historic "Stonehenge" a pile of very large slabs which have been there for centuries. As a matter of fact no one seems to know the real history about them. We are having extra rough weather in these parts, it has been raining for several days.
