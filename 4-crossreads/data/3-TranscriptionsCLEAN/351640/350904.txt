 C/o. D. M. S. Cairo Egypt 12th July 1915. 
 My Dear Girls: 
 Under separate registered cover I am sending to you this mail the power of attorney which will give to you all power to deal with any lands that may be in my name.  I read the document this afternoon and it appears to be amply wide in most respects. 
 If Buchanan had attended at once to instructions the necessary papers from him should have been here some weeks back, however the matter has now been fixed up. 
 A letter was posted to you this morning and I hope that it may reach you rapidly and be worth the reading. 
 My hospital has today 470 patients, enough to satisfy any man but a small staff to deal with them. 
 Rumour from the highest quarters says to day here that a big fight is to take place at Galipoli during the next few days, and that preparation is being made in Egypt for the accommodation of several thousands of patients.  Let us hope that the result may be of the best for us.   Personally I am not too sanguine because those who have so far conducted the campaign have underestimated the fighting prowess of the Turk, and now it may be that this fight is but an effort on the part of a general who has failed to redeem his shattered reputation, if such be the case every one will be glad if he meets with success, but if the attack fails he will be deeper in the mire than ever, to defeat so wily and determined a foe as the rank and file of the Turks led by capable German officers will be a difficult proposition, this is the first time for at least one century that the soldiers of the Ottoman empire have had men of knowledge and above corruption to lead them in fair fight in their own or any other country, and no one knows to what extent they may recover their old reputation.   Let us hope that they may receive the thrashing of such kind as has not been known to them during this or any other century. 
 Good night my dears.   God bless you & guard you from all evil both mental and physical.  Some extracts are enclosed.  May still fair thoughts and happy hours attend upon you, while Heaven gives to you many, many merry days.  Heaps of love and loads of kisses from your loving and affectionate father. John B. Nash
