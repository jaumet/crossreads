Here is what I have written in Bert Emmott's autograph album - my first original poem - least of all sonnet: -
"A topic sketch, I know, is what you fainWould have; yet I have thought 'twere better toEvolve some helping thought, to give to you -Clothed in rough chaff, - a simple little grain.On life, the calling which you choose, - or brainOr hand, if you success desire to woo,Demands you pass through tests: heights are tabooUnless the standard of each test you attain
So in the moral side of life you'll findSoul testing opposition, needing strengthTo overcome; after a fight, at lengthYou'll reach a point - to failure half resignedWeakness will whisper to you: "Never mind".Fight on: that foe can ne'er be left behind."
