<p>A cool night bucks one up for the following day.  Only 2 drinks per day for the Horses &amp; 1 gallon per man every drop of water is pumped along a small pipe from Barges on the Canal.  In the Australasian April 1, there are illustrations of plenty of young men at social functions &amp; Button Days etc  Pity the don't exchange their Garden Parties for the Desert &amp; Flies  All our Water for drinking is carried in flat sided Galvanised ironed Tins called Fantassies.  You can imagine how hot they get on the Camels, by midday.</p>
