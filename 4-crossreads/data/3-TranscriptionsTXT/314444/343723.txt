 Dearest Mother &amp; Father, Just a few lines to let you know I am well &amp; feeling tip top. I recieved your letter and the cuttings. I am glad to hear that you are both well. I knew you would miss Dorothy tremendously. Never mind I may be home this Xmas Things are going very well on this front, and the swines are getting more than they want. By jove they gave me a glorious send off at the mess. The best I was ever at. They gave me a fine whisky decanter three bottles in it, one after the style of Jacks, a silver flask &amp; a clock. I have left them with Miss Astin, and if I go under they will be forwarded on to Aunt Florrie, to be sent out to you. I also left with Stans Sister a silver cigarette case, silver fountain pen &amp; a gold wristlet watch. When she comes out you will get them. Miss Astin has been so good to me, I told her to keep the clock. She sends me parcels &amp; papers. Will write soon. Kind regards to all friends, hoping you are both well Love &amp; kisses Your loving Son
