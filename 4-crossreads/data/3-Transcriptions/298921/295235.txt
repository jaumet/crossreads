<p>September, 1915<br/>Tuesday 21<br/>Here are two Yarns from our men &ndash; one was covered by earth from a high explosive shell, which bent his rifle [small sketch] &amp; filled mouth &amp; eyes with sand - <strike>Lomax</strike> by name jumped up, thinking Turks were on Top of him &amp; went to fire his rifle, which of course made his mates scatter because of the Bend in it.!!! Another man borrowed a Chisel from the Machine Gunners to open!! a shell which had not burst !!! (Turks)<br/>The stretcher bearers carried him away minus one arm (the shell did burst) but all that could be heard from the stretcher was "I promised to return the chisel" (just samples of mental aberrations or Hysteria)</p>
