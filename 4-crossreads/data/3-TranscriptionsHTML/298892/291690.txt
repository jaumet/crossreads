<p>Fritz's bullets are copper coated and look very nice polished and the others have all sorts of schemes for making ornaments out of them. Personally I have all I want, that is one of each, rifle and machine gun. Some of the nose caps are rather nice with their different rings of steel and copper and markings for regulating the fuse, but they are too heavy to carry about with one and their weight debars one from posting them. One of Fritz's latest and deadliest bombs known as the pineapple is rather unique. I say bomb but it is really a rifle grenade and is furnished with four fins something like this:- [sketch]  I have secured portion of one but it is also fairly weighty and probably I will have to discard it later on.</p>
