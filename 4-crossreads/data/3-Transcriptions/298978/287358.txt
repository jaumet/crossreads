<p>The Charge of the 4th A.I.Bde at Bloody Angle Anzac May 2 1915</p>
<p>This trench had been giving us considerable trouble owing to its position, commanding as it did, practically the main artery of Anzac, the road  (if such it could be called.) through which our supplies were brought: eventually it became quite impossible to get further stores  through.<br/>The landing of supplies on April 25th had been an infinally more difficult task, it is time, but our ranks had become so decimated, the line so thinly held that we could no longer afford to throw away lives upon what we knew as certain death; it would have still further weakened an already weak front., and give the enemy the chance to break through; give to them the opportunity they had been so ardently awaiting.
