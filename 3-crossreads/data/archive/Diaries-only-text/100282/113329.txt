them, one of them had a piece of shell as big as a pigeons egg graze across his backside cut three nasty gashes in it bruised him terribly, I put iodione all over the wound fixed him up. We had 1 man killed 3 wounded wonderful how there were no more. Coming back I managed to tread up to my waist in water slush a pretty pickle I was in wet for the rest of the day. This was one of the worst little "barrages" of heavy stuff as ever I have seen the casualities we had can be laid at the Transports door.
A funny thing happened at this dressing station a few days ago, they brought a wounded man down when they cut his clothes off to dress the wound, the Dr nearly fainted, for the supposed man was a girl, she had been in one of the Berkshire regiments for nearly a year no one dropped to it what price her for a game kid, I believe she was sent straight on "to Blighty" she deserved it more besides
