5/4/18 ? Bertangles
the Band played. Crowded with troops, part of Corps H.Q. and D.H.Q. are here. Found my billet a nice clean room and talked to Madame who was an old woman, only son killed, and very despondent about the War. The estaminets were open between 12-2 and some men speedily got drunk riotous on the wretched local wine. Beer is unobtainable. Had to put a strong picquet on to quell brawls ? disgraceful. The men are excited at the prospect of hopping over and there is a tense feeling. The wine affects them very much. Saw A.P.M. hope avoid recurrence tonight.
