<p>it was a splendid thing &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed it.  A funny thing happened this evening Miss Nissen introduced me to some of her friends &amp; one of them was the lady whom I had sat next to the first night I had gone to the theatre a Drs. wife Mrs. Palmer she turned out to be we both laughed heartily over it.<br/>All the warships have left the harbour for Heliogoland to take over the remainder of the German fleet, &amp; whats more 4 German subs came in flying the white flag &amp; with open hatches, they could not have been lurking too far from Plymouth Sound.<br/>This morning the Daily Mail printed a lot of the Generals photos who had helped to win the war &amp; they omitted Birdwoods so our hut wired to the Daily Mail wanting to know why this was, we also sent a telegram of congratulations to Birdie.  I wonder if he will reply or not.</p>
