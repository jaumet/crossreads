Continued  (4) How I won the V.C.
Just a bayonet stab through the gizzard
 a crack from a bullet ot two.
But I nerved my strength for the conflict
 just as the darkness came down
I was under their parapet resting
 knew I had beaten them brown.
For this was the scheme I had worked on
Twas a little bit mean you will say
But I knew that the turks were half famished
 fought on a biscuit a day.
 the tins of Fray Bento's I carried
I chucked in the trench then there.
as I heard the poor beggars pounce on it
I knew they were caught in the snare.
Next morning broke calm peaceful
What a shame that we soldiers must fight
Twas a pitious scene met my vision
with the first rosy quivers of light
When I peeped in the trench not a turk sir
was left of that legion accurst
For they?d whacked the Fray Bento's between them
 each man had perished from thirst.
Thats my tale if you know our mob sir
You'll know how our Colonel can smile
He said to me Pte Juggin's
You've dished up the beggars in style
Promotion! some say I deserve it.
But thats really nothing to me.
I don't want honour or glory
but thats how I win the V.C.
