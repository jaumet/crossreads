  
 September 1918. Sunday 8 
 In a reserve position, 4 miles from Peronne. Sunday, a beautiful morning a deadly afternoon. Had an early visit from Fritz, no material damage so far as I have hard. As we are in reserve we have not been firing and that means a spell for everyone.  News to hand shews that the infantry advanced on Vendrelles, after capturing Matevillers and Villerscholles. The former village is fairly close to the Hinderburg Line and three miles from St.Quentin.  I wrote a large number of letters.
