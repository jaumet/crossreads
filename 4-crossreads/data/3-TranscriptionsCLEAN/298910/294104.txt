Not quite so cold - Had a good sleep during the day - Very busy during the night - Fritz put up a very heavy barrage of shrapnel & Gas shells over Needle & Rose trenches - good many 32nd Batt were caught in the Gas - poor devils did suffer - an Officer died from effects during the night. Heavy bombardment all along the line.
Friday  16/2/17
Not quite so cold - a bit of a thaw set in & it is getting a bit muddy. About daylight Fritz managed to bomb one of our ammunition dumps about 2 miles away - such a deafening noise of the shells exploding all day long I have never heard before - the sky was left black with clouds from the bursts - must have been a very big loss. Our planes got busy during the day - saw two Fritzs planes brought down, also two of ours, poor devils were burnt to death. A few more gassed cases came through, only a few wounded.
