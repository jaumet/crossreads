  
 We passed two ships today one of which was challenged by our cruiser, but allowed to go on its way; the other was a well-known American packet boat. 
 Jan. 21. We all attended Church Parade this morning and by way of novelty wore our life-belts there. In the evening we had a sing-song from Alexander's hymn-book until it was too dark to see and then of course the cold drive us down stairs until next morning. We do enjoy singing the old, well-known hymns and sending up our petitions to the throne of grace on behalf of those whom we have left behind in Australia. 
 Jan. 22. On guard again. Alan & I had posts next to one another and so did not mind the job in the slightest, although the night shifts were very cool. 
 Jan. 23. Rough and cold and windy to-day. Boys seem extra noisy & happy. We slept all day, had a cold shower before tea & read etc. in evening.
