He came about 8 p.m., just time to go to sleep. But neither of us cared for sleep that night. We had to discuss all that had happened since we had parted in Cairo nine months before. At times we had been very close, only a few miles apart.</p>
<p>Tom is very keen on his work, &amp; has at last managed to join a gun crew. The 24th Battery had been for three weeks in an advanced position&mdash;only 600 yards from the enemy's line.
