July 17 Contd 27Raining today - It is rumoured that the French officer who escaped from the Hospital has been captured somewhere near the Russian fro[nt.] His food supply must have given out as it was impossible for him to get lost, he having a compass & maps. He is in the prison attached this camp & thro the kindness of the Commdt, who is a jolly decent chap, his french comrades are allowed to send him food.
July 18thVery little sleep. Breakfast 9 am when we had porridge, cocoa & Bread & Jam; Played Gallagher chess again, I being the loser. Good Dinner today, watched a game of bowls today. To French class at 4.30 after tea.
Had my foot bandaged again today. Doctor took 5 names of officers in Hospital today to be exchanged for German officers. Two of the 5 are not minus limbs, so we shall be surprised if an exchange is made for them. The Commandant visited them & told them all that they would be in London very soon - How lucky.
The Doctor thoroughly examined my foot & said I could not be exchanged but my name was taken to be sent to Switzerland (3 of us altogether) I hope this eventuates, it ought to be quite nice there. All this is apparently the outcome of the Conference in the Hague a few days ago, all hands are very excited naturally as 16000 prisoners German & English are to be sent to neutral countries
