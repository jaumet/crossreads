Though fighting's not your special work,We know you're not the sort to shirkA rough & tumble with the Turk.You will not spare 'em,And you will prove that you're as stirkWhere there's a harem.
You'll find promotion rather slowUnless you blow up Jericho,Or do some deed of dering doAnd win the V.C.
If that should happen let us know -Drop us a p.c.At times you may be short of grub,For Palestine is mostly scrub.You'll think of us chaps at The Club,While you're away.Conder will dun you for your sub,We hope you'll pay!Now - whether you be pictures [indecipherable] -Or in the ice-cold ocean swimming -Or killing Turks or kissing womenI know one who's a limbOf Satan - so - in bumper brimmingHere's to Jerusalem!
