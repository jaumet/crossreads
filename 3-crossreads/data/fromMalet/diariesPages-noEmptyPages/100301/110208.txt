I got another chap we lifted him out put him in a shell hole as we worked so we covered him up, such is a soldiers death. we could not leave him uncovered all next day so as day was drawing near, that was the best we could do with him poor chap, to cover him up straight away as he was badly battered about the Head bled a lot that would have caused the nasty big green flies to come feed off him if he remained uncovered.
I met the officer afterwards who came back to us months afterwards when we were at Raineville he shook Hands with me for bringing him in wounded.
We dug dug until I was simply exhausted was glad to get out to Sausage Gully where we were sent what remained of us while there I missed certain death by the kindness of a Corporal out of a Tommy battery who was going on duty offered me his place in his dug-out which I accepted. 
I had previously laid out my oil sheet to lye on put my Haversack down to act as a pillow we were all asleep at 3.30 am in the morning a shell came over close to us killed one chap who was in a dug-out along with another man when the shell burst he cried out we rushed got him into our dug-out he had a big wound between his knee anckle I bound it up as best I could but it was a big wound we only had first aid dressings with us his warm blood was pumping out onto my Hands which made me feel queer, however stretchers came up from the Battery took him off
