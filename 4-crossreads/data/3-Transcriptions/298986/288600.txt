<p>Have sliped considerably about writing this up.  Have had rather less time than usual.  Chief events, Bookkeeping Class 3 days per week Motor class twice.  The B-keeping takes up a good deal of time with home work &amp; notes.  Last Sat. went Chateau Gorshea with the Pardre.  It was a wet afternoon but we had (9 of us) a good walk &amp; saw some of the country.  There is a fine wood at the Chateau</p>
