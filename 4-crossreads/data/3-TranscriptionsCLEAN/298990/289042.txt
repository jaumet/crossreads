  
 Steenvoorde 20/10/16  This morning early was one of the coldest I have ever experienced in my life.  Hunt awakened me from a chilly sleep at 5.30 am.  It was pitch dark and the cold seemed to strike right through blankets and coats.  We fell in at 7.45 and at 8 am we moved off in column of route with our transport wagons in rear.  The day was a fine one and we marched spells of 45 minutes to the hour and 15 minutes rest.  Being in good time we took two hours over our lunch.  There was much traffic on the roads -  artillery amc and many other mobile troops.  At one halt there were a great many German prisoners constructing railway yards.  Hereabouts we noticed some big puffs of shrapnel to our rear and I was a little anxious until the Battalion got out of range.  Two Taubes came over just after one of our airmen had been giving a most daring exhibition of his art in looping the loop, diving and other things.  The "archies" flecked the whole sky but the Taubes escaped.  At Abeele we saw the Corps Commander and just outside the village there is a large aerodrome above which many aeroplanes were flying.  Some of the side slips and dives were most audacious.  One chap came to grief his plane dived into the ground and was wrecked but he escaped alive.  We halted while some of the men released him from his seat.  He said "What has happened, did I hit the ground?"  One of our wags at once replied 'Too b--- true you did old cock".  He was able to walk home.  We passed from France into Belgium hereabouts.  A post marks the boundary.  We now begin to see more decent people and pretty girls.  The women are very industrious in the fields.  The country round this side of that striking landscape Mont des Cats is very beautiful and quite different to the ordinary monotonous scenery.
