January, 1917. Friday 12Arose at 7.20 and arrived at work at 9. Only work to do unload pontoons and carry to dump and inspect advanced dump. Showers of sleet all day and in between brilliant sunshine and clear observation. Home at 4. and after tea, read and wrote this up. Fritz's plane came over and afterwards his land travelled over was shelled. Dugouts to be left to-day and parties to work day shift on the M.G. positions.
