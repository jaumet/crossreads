Tuesday 4 May 1915
"Stand to Arms!"  "Fix Bayonets!"  Then I woke up, not from my disturbed "forty winks" in the narrow trenches, but from my best night's rest for many a long day.  Only in a dream did the harsh words of command ring in my ears, only in a dream did I prepare to rise from my cramped position, and reach out for my rifle.  For I woke up to find myself lying on a soft mattress with three or four blankets over, very warm, very cosy.  Then the events of yesterday dawned on me.  Of course, I had been brought on board the Union Castle liner "Gloucester Castle" by some of the boys from H.M.S. London, I had been hoisted up over the side on a stretcher and made very comfortable.  So here I am, with many others, helpless and wounded but happy.  This fine transport is being fitted out as a hospital ship and for a week or at any rate will be our home.
To-day the rest of the A.M.O. officers and men came on board - a detachment from the West Australian section of No. 2 Stationary Hospital.  Operating Rooms were established in various parts of the ship and they "got busy".  But more and more wounded came and the medical staff vainly endeavoured to cope with the rush.
