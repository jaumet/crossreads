<p>Wednesday 13-12-16<br/>Received word today that Scotty Crichton has died.  On deep dug outs today &amp; yesterday.  We still see Indian Troops about doing fatigues on the Road.</p>
<p>Thursday 14-12-16<br/>The last big batch of Reos are the biggest lot of Brums I have ever seen.  They are going back in Batches every day and about 80&percnt; are on sick parade every morning.</p>
<p>Sunday 17-12-16<br/>Guns are being moved away.  Traffic on the road had also slackened.  The Tram has now moved nearly up to Flers.  Sharkey came back &amp; stayed one day &amp; vamoosed  again his nerves are quite gone.   suffering from itch now (I am) can hardly sleep at night.  I picked up a pair of foul Under pants yesterday that means some dirty washing.</p>
