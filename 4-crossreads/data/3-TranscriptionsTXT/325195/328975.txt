18.10.15Mon 18thA message came through last night saying The Turks fast from the 18th to the 20th & we are to be prepared for a fanatical attack in consequence; Sentries & the patrol have been doubled tonight: I came into the tent to go to bed tonight & found there had been a land slide & there is about a yard of dirt over most of our gear; I generally put in an hour or two after tea playing cards  We were issued with a new blanket each to-day Believed that 3rd LH Patrol was ambushed and captured last Saturday night
