<p>18/10/17 Paris<br />the boulevards eyeing the passers by. Every &quot;mutile&quot; of the war wears to double decoration of Crox de Guerre and Medalle Militaire as some slight compensation for his lost limb. At the theatre there is little doing.

The Paris tube is an excellent institution and so well arranged as to make it nearly impossible for even the foreigner to mistake his train. The first class carriages are painted white and their Tate car like interiors are always full of a good looking and fashionably dressed crowd. The military element predomines in every collection of people. Came home to my hotel the Alma station being 50 yards from its front door. The crises of coal makes these places colder than in times past &amp; hot water is not always on.</p>
