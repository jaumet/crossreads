<p>1919<br/>Jan 16<br/>dame came along selling coffee at one franc a time.  It was a pretty hot price, but she was well patronised.  It took us 5 hours to go from one side of Mons to the other.  Goodness only knows what the delay was.  We were fed up with the sight of the place.  Our train was so long it had an engine back &amp; front.  When at last we got going, a coupling broke in the middle of the train.  Some brainy wit with a red handkerchief waved it to the driver of the front engine who stopped.  The driver of the rear engine came on &amp; banged the rest of the train right into us.  I was sitting in a doorway with my feet hanging out.  The heavy door banged up against my hip,  I though I had some bones broken for the minute.  Some of the boys jumped clear.   Some who were moving about in the truck, fell over, cutting their heads &amp; faces on the sharp ends of biscuit tins.  No one was killed.  The coupling that broke was on the officers carriage.  The carriage was badly damaged at one end &amp; was also off the rails.  Railway</p>
