  
 May, 1915 Wednesday 5 Hospitals all full [indecipherable] Today we got orders for dismounted drill, Horses to be sent afterwards, as no use for mounted men at present at - a good deal of heart burning at losing horses but glad to get into action. Sent all surplus horses to depot - Where we go I cannot tell you, but it is not far away, & when we go will be advised by letter to you.
