 Judge of the Supreme Court, an appointment which was made permanent in 1912. In 1931 I retired on reaching the statutory retiring age of 70. 
 Since then my leisure has been prevented from becoming burdensome by the opportunity that has been given me of doing public work as a Royal Commissioner. I hope it has not been without value to the State. Now, writing  at the age of  in my 77th  year, I look forward to being allowed  year, I am cheered by the knowledge that there is still work which those in authority think I may  I hope to  be allowed to do. 
 So much for the present on  the  purely personal  side of my  matters.
