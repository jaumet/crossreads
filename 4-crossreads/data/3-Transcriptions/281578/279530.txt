An engineer officer pointed out the work, digging a trench 4 feet deep &ndash; it was soft earth , &amp; already half dug, so didn't take long, &amp; we were back in our little "homes" at 1.30 a.m. Even when home is only a dugout, it's the nicest spot there is, just because it is home, &amp; Crain &amp; I are comfortable in our pozzy, with the mattress on the ground, &amp; quilts round the sides, evidently salvaged from the houses in Corbie by previous soldier boys.
