that what was called The Invincible Spanish Armada had been sighted
The naval incidents in this war sufficiently discloses that the Spirit of Drake & of Nelson still permeates the Navy & when ever required the skilful organization the intelligent direction, the indomitable courage, the intrepid recklessness to achieve the alleged impossible, the steady nerve, the indefatiguable determination & persistent tenacity are ready to start into instant action in the customary calm invincible manner.
Both vessels now being all ready for sea were moved to the outer harbor & were merely waiting to receive advice from the Naval patrol "outside" that the "Coast was clear".
During this "wait" one thing that could not help being noticed here, was the splendid type of coastal & fishing "boats", & small sailing vessels frequenting this harbor, all appeared on lines similar to & as well built as yachts, the capabilities of the vessels & the skill of the crews made them appear as if they were.
To one who had taken some little interest in ordinary boat sailing the handling of these little vessels in fair or foul weather claimed unstinted admiration. No question of doubt could arise that their home was the ocean wave.
On Wednesday the 23rd May 1917 the anchors of both vessels were weighed and the "Homeward bound" journey of the "Ayrshire" commenced.
Passing through one of the entrances of a splendidly built breakwater, a stupendous monument of the engineering skill in erecting a defence that successfully resists the unceasing attacks of that tremendous Ocean's roll, to the dipping of flags & the blowing of whistles & horns of quite a large fleet of trading steamers anchored inside, both vessels headed for the open sea.
