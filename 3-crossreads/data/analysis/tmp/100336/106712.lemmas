 a small loaf of bread , no meat , not enough for a grow boy , much less men do hard manual work ( 9 hour a day ) . We turn to at six in the morn , had from 8.30 till 9 for breakfast , but we were issu with noth , we may have a piec of dri bread left from previous night . Side note : our ration here consist of a hard sort of brown pea - not unlik Indian corn - boil with Olive oil . Sometim we got a littl rice lot of water For 3 month at midday even we had a larger kind of black hors bran full of small grub v. hard . These too were boil with oil water . NB The onli meat we ever got was the light , no liver , they sometim crawl which we would n't give to a dog in Aust . Mani time we all long for scrap we had thrown away befor in the good old time . When we found ourselv get weak and run down we began to make complaint about the harsh treatment but it fell on deaf ear . Moreov the German would n't allow the Dutch Ambassador to give us money to buy food . They said if we had money from other sourc we would not work for our food . This was foolish becaus of the high cost of live at Gelebek it cost 1:0:0 per day . Mani , mani night we went to our dug out - no hut or tent were given- hungri and done up . Veri soon 15 out of our 25 had to be carri to the hospit nearbi , too ill and weak to slave ani longer . Note: - There were no shop parti here as we were work right in the villag and could buy whenev we want , but money was the difficulti . A larg number of Russian were driven into Camp soon after and they immedi began to increas their own food allow by steal veri consider and success . They did n't wast time complain but veri soon the German did at the loss of their stuff . The pilfer soon reach such a pitch that the whole lot of us were shift and Turkish soldier put in our place . Two of my pal were sent to the Electric Depart My friend and I went to the River Railway Repair Shop . This chang gave us more liberti of action , so much so , did we appreci the chang that it made us wish for more and we decid to tri and escap again . In pass I might say that the 6 shop in Gelebek were kept so well stock with all sort of thing , stolen by the Turk who took a our place that at last the German made a veri success raid on these shop one day and much loot was recovr . It would have been too much like the devil rebuk sin for the German to punish the Turk for this for the whole was seeth with corrupt . Ani sick prison return out of hospit , alway spoke in the highest favour of the English Doctor there . Captain Clifford I.M.S. Though he was work under German restrict and supervis he- be an expert in Malaria , forc the Author to give better treatment and more food to the patient . His was a fine exampl of bulldog tenac and British pluck for he kept on fight against the power that were . , until he either shame or worri them into give the sick a fight chanc . His unremit care and constant self sacrific was a nobl rebuk to the callous of the German and mani a poor wretch rose up call him " Bless " . The 2 german nurs work with him were so influenc by his splendid exampl that they soon favour the English to the Turk on whose side they were suppos to be a name ="a3901071" >
