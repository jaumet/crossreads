<p>Wednesday 16 February, 1916</p>
<p>It rained a little in the afternoon but it didn&#39;t matter as it was our half holiday.</p>
<p>We had some rather good tucker today, bacon for dinner also a ration of cheese &amp; raisons.</p>
<p>We are very expectant today. We have heard that that a big mail is due tomorrow &amp; that a lot of stores we ordered from the canteen is coming in the morning. To cap it all we have been told that leave for 48 hours to 3 %&nbsp;<s>leave</s>&nbsp;of the man is being granted soon as we are quite excted.</p>
<p>Bob Harris &amp; Andy Luke went to hospital with mumps.</p>
<p>Our canteen stuff arrived tonight. Had a feed on the strength of it.</p>
