February, 1915Wednesday 24Received letter from May today dated 28/12/14, also a letter from Sydney - more talk of moving very soon it is hard to tell whether I go or stay, as the Regiment is full of Officers - but Col [indecipherable] wants me so he says & I know it is true. When we drill in the Desert [indecipherable] boys seem to spring out of the sand at every [indecipherable] "Orangie big one [indecipherable] piastre" or Eggs "cook" two for one (piastre) [indecipherable] cooked eggs - they wear robes of white or [indecipherable] & add color to the landscape.
