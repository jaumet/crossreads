<p>APRIL 1917</p>
<p>3 TUESDAY</p>
<p>It was blowing a blizzard</p>
<p>in the morning &amp; the ground</p>
<p>was white with snow. It</p>
<p>even came up through</p>
<p>cracks in the weather boards</p>
<p>of the hut. The worst morning</p>
<p>I have ever seen. Cleaning up</p>
<p>round stables ect all day.</p>
<p>Some of the gunners came</p>
<p>down from the guns, only</p>
<p>leaving three to a gun</p>
<p>up there.</p>
