<p>Dear Col. Wallack;<br />This will serve to introduce to you, Herr Wilhelm Wostrack, German Resident Commissioner of Nauru, who was taken Prisoner by me along with twenty-five (25) others on 6th instant.</p>
<p>Herr Wostrack has been on parole since leaving Nauru, and I trust, in view of the high office he held and the assistance he has given me, that the same consideration may be extended to him by you on his arrival in Sydney.&nbsp; He is accompanied&nbsp; also by his Wife.</p>
<p>With kindest regards.</p>
<p>Colonel.<br />Administrator.</p>
<p>Colonel E.T. Wallack, C.B.<br />District Commander,<br />Sydney.</p>
