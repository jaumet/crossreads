<p>Friday 27th April 1917<br/>Grooming and harness cleaning.<br/>As one approaches the firing line for the first time, the spectacle is inspiring, thrilling and often nerve-racking. Hundreds of shells from our field batteries and 60 lbders whistle continually overhead on their errands of destruction towards the German lines. The fields everywhere are ploughed up with shell craters. The roads are continually being damaged, billets and farmhouses are in ruins, while working parties of hundreds, and even thousands are constantly repairing the roads. You may walk by a hedge, fence or a thicket and never dream that it masks an entire battery.<br/>We have all grown accustomed to the many disguises such as painting the guns to resemble branches and trunks of trees. Unless one has been in the battle zone it is impossible to realise how cleverly the guns are masked.</p>
