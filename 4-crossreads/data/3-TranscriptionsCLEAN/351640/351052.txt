  
 S.S. El Kahara Mudros Harbour 15-10-15 3 p.m. The same line of steamers as the Ismailia - The Kehdevial S.S. Coy. 
 Dear Girls:/ 
 This morning I was ordered to be read for the pinnace at 2 p.m. At that hour Jerrom and I were ready and on board the small steamer. We were brought across the harbour and with our baggage are now, 3 p.m., on board a steamer named the El Kahara, in which we are soon to leave for Anzac. 
 There is a Dr. Carlisle from Australia, who belongs to a Clearing hospital, and who came from Australia in the Kyarra with me, and a few other officers on board. A number of soldiers are on deck cleaning their rifles and seeing to their packs. The only freight that I noticed on deck are boxes of cartridges. The steamer is something about the size of the Namoi which plys between Newcastle and Sydney. 
 There is a fleet of great war ships anchored round about us, also passenger ships converted into troopers, two yachts of ample size and proportioned beautifully, one is the headquarters of the Red Cross and the second is for the headquarters staff
