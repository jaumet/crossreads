 They ll sweat and toil and curs the while They ll booz and riot , but fight like God And starv and freez and burn , but smile Cut out the wows ! What the odd War 's not a feed of milk and bun ! Its Hell let loos ! and devil work ! So cheer the "bad boy " at the gun But shut the mouth of saint who shirk . Jack Sommer
