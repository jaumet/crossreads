<p>side is frozen solid. There are blocks of ice in the shell holes six feet thick, and everything is as still as the South Pole.<br/>1st February. 1917.<br/>A quiet day and night but it is frightfully cold.

This is a most extraordinary sector, here we stand all night in full view of the Fritz's, yet we dare not shoot at him or he at us. I hope to hear the Bosches sing the Hymn of Hate, before I go away from here.</p>
