<p>January 1918<br/>Tuesday 1</p>
<p>At Beutin<br/>Well I have had a very good time today under the prevailing circumstances.<br/>The weather has been very cold's late, but today the Clerk seems to have made some resolutions, for the New Year, and has certainly given us a glorious day.<br/>I went for a long walk this morning to Beutin, a la Coloterie, a village ten kilos off.<br/>My billet pals two, being Scotchmen have celebrated the festive day rather well.<br/>Our lunch today was cooked by the Madame who owns our billet, and consisted of fowls and potatoes roasted, washed down by coffee</p>
