June 25th 1917This record begins with my appointment to the 1st Bde.After 10 days leave in England I joined up with the 3rd Batt of the 1st Bde. which was resting in reserve at a small village named Buise near Albert.For some weeks the Division has been enjoying a well earned rest after the fierce fighting at Bullecourt but the end of that rest is now approaching.
