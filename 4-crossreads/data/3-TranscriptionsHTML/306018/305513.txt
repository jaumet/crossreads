<p>April 1918<br/>&amp; I enjoyed it very much.  In the last Australian mail I got 3 letters, one from Kate one from home &amp; one from Edna Ferguson.  Havn't had time to reply to any of them yet.</p>
<p>Thursday 18th April<br/>Usual mornings work.  In the afternoon Records Section played AIF H'Qrs cricket &amp; beat them by 50 or 60 runs.  It was a good match.  I went out to Gezira to see it.  Havn't made up my mind yet whether to play this year or not.</p>
