<p>H.M.A.S. Fantome<br/>Dec 7 &ndash; 14</p>
<p>Dear girl<br/>While I think of it &ndash; The 'Lawn King' is a very good brand of mower &ndash; Pay for it out of my Queen St Balance &ndash; It's my little present to the garden &ndash; It was hot yesterday &ndash; I put it in at Roseville with Blackwell &ndash; He's a pleasant fellow &ndash; His wife, a fine girl of just 20 &amp; a boy are all stone deaf &ndash; Enquiries come in &ndash; none of them can hear you unless you speak very loudly &ndash; I saw a man who had just come from England &ndash; He &amp; Lord Chelmsford &amp; the Editor of Pearsons had all tried to get evidence of the maiming of children &ndash; hands cut off &ndash; The Editor he said offered 500 &pound; for any photo of same &ndash; nothing came of it &ndash; They never cd. get hold of anything authentic &ndash;<br/>At 11 pm I was on board the Fantome &ndash; for good &ndash; I slept in board &amp; about 5 am got up &amp; studied the situation &ndash; I have a good cabin &ndash; top side with lots of air &ndash; a fan &ndash; 6 drawers under my bunk &amp; a table. At 9 am we went out for gun &amp; speed trials &ndash; There was a beastly swell outside &amp; dozens were seasick &ndash; There are 109 all told of us &ndash; We got off the 12 pounders &ndash; They are really 5 inch guns or thereabouts &ndash; We go by the diameter of the cartridge so that a 13.5 gun means a charge 13.5 inches in diameter &ndash;<br/>There was a flash &amp; a roar &amp; a hiss in the air &amp; then a spurt of sea water a long way off &ndash;</p>
