Fulton of the 3rd Regiment had a narrow escape at Romani on Thursday last when the Enemy Bombed the Camp.  The Horse he was untying was Blown to pieces, leaving the rope in His hand &amp;amp; a man quite close had His Head severed.  The Enemy dropped 6 Eggs in all, 4 falling wide of the mark &amp;amp; the other two had only a Local effect.  The Taubes 2 in number were estimated to be 4,000 ft. in the air &amp;amp; circled around for about 15 minutes before dropping the bombs.  There was a general stampede of Horses, &amp;amp; to date about 140 animals still missing.  Where the bomb actually fell Horse Flesh &amp;amp; Human Flesh were massed together, a number of men be killed whilst saddling their Horses.<br/>I should think that men <strike>at</strike> without waiting for Orders ought to spring on the Horse without Saddle &amp;amp; Gallop away, at the same time scattering in all directions.</p>
