<p>Friday 25 August 1916<br/>A rather muggy day with one or two showers of rain. During the morning on the go in Gezaincourt &amp; after lunch rode on horseback in to Doullens with Mr. Watson to see about some entraining items. Back by 4 o'clock &amp; at 5 marched out with H.Q. details for Doullens where, after fixing up entrainment we had dinner at one of the hotels, getting back to the troop train about 8 o'clock. The train left Doullens about 9.30 p.m.</p>
