Tuesday 22 May 1917
Lunched at Division Head Quarters. Weather much warmer now but Khamsin has stopped Howling.
Off on the Raid this afternoon a 36 hour stunt to blow up the railway. I cannot go into details but it means fighting our way & 2 nights in the Saddle. I hope I am back to continue my Diary tomorrow or with a nice soft wound en route for Cairo . Allanson is here going strong on Galloper, he often brings me a message from the C.O.
