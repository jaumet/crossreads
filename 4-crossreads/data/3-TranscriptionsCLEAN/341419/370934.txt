 Which they did this afternoon so now there is nothing here to keep us from moving north towards Damascus. 
 Our Forces are reported to be 9 miles from Damascus & expected to be entering tonight.  So we have been in the curious position of carrying on fighting almost 100 miles behind the Front Line. 
 What will happen now I don't know.  Unless the turks can provide & send a brand new Army down to oppose us there
