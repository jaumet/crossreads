to pass the Medical Officer at Fremantle & no leave was permitted owing to the Spanish Influenza. The Western Australians disembarked here. From Fremantle we sailed to Adelaide. The same procedure in regard to Medical examination was in vogue here. South Australians disembarked here. From here we sailed to Tasmania down the East Coast. It was rough & cold & our course lay close to the Coast. The Coast was very rugged & rough. We sailed up steamed up the River anchoring about seven miles below Hobart. The Tasmanians 16 in all disembarked. What a waste
