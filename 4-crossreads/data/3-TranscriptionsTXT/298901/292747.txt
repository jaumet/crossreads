Friday 28th JuneFine weather.  Confirmed that 10000 shells have fallen into Amiens, one in seven houses having been hit.  Tis indeed a wreck.  A smart piece of hun work at dinnertime.  He dived from a cloud & set one of our balloons alight then flew over us quite low.  Not one of our planes was in sight at the moment so he chose his time well.  Fritz over again at night & this time his bombs were closer.  No casualties however but he set fire to a tractor.
Saturday 29th JuneHeard today that the Hun who brought down the balloon came to grief later.  Matters still quiet.
Sunday 30th JuneNothing doing.  Prepared reqs. For the week in quantities large enough for a stunt as there are persistent rumours of one.
Monday 1st JulySet off to Crouy to collect the drugs.  Roads very quiet.  Had a swim in the Somme whilst waiting for the things & on the return had lunch at Picquigny.
Tuesday 2nd JulyNew dressing station almost finished so will hand over to the nursing duty Sgt tomorrow
