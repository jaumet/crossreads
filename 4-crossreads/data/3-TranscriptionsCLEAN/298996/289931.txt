It was bitterly cold this morning when we stood to arms. 6th Reinforcements arrived here to day & to see the way the Adjutant R. S. Major & Major Herring allotted the men off into there different company would make one sick no wonder the men are an unruly lot. The Turks were giving us some big shells Re got ones for a change today. This attack will be all along the line. Rations to day Bacon & Bread Jam Sugar Tea Potatos, Milk 8 tins. In the back the shrapnels shells are still Playing up with our men 20 are wounded today. The Turks sunk a couple of water Barges today, which meens no water for a day, perhaps longer. Aeroplanes up again this evening. Rum issue. Big Drunk Man
