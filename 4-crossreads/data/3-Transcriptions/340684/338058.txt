<p>H.M.N.Z. Troopship No 8.<br/>Auckland Harbour<br/>11th October 1914</p>
<p>My dear Father<br/>Many thanks for your kind letter- I wrote a long letter to you just before we sailed the first time, but evidently by your letter it must have gone astray-  After 6 weeks training in camp we embarked on September 23rd- two troopships took us the "Waismana" No 12 &amp; "Star of India" No 8-  We went on board the Waismana 1600 men &amp; 600 horses.  600 men &amp; 400 horses went on the Star of India.  We lay in the Harbour all night &amp; at 9 o'clock the following morning steamed away with H.M.S. "Philomel" as a convoy.  It was an awful experience we were packed in bunks down the Hold's like sardines &amp; the heat &amp; smell was simply awful-  I turned into my bunk early &amp; the first thing I heard in the morning was men yelling out that we were back in Auckland-  You can imagine the disappointment it was to us all.  We anchored in the Harbour &amp; stayed</p>
