<p>Monday 1st April 1917 [1918]<br/>April 1st and how do I celebrate it!  11 a.m. comes.  Home sister today, prepare for Shoubra as I have diph.!!!  Feeling to sick to care I throw a few things together &amp; after a kindly visit from C. Collins who endeavours to cheer me up, am borne off on a stretcher to the albulance [ambulance] in company with the everlasting Miss Moreton.  When I wonder will I shake her off finally!<br/>Arrive Shoubra 12.45 p.m. &amp; after a hasty survey of me the M.O. departs only to return 2 p.m. with an inj. of anti diph. 4000 units.  Result of this is an awful night &amp; terrible thirst.<br/>Matron visits me but too miserable to be polite.</p>
