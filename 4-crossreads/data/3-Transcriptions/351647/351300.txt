<p>to be away from the front.  We are you know having what they term a rest!!!  Of course we don't have the continued roar of the guns in our ears &amp; we don't have the knowledge we may be shelled at any time.  Also we don't have to rush ammunition up to batteries at all hours of day or night but all the same its better somehow.  We have been here a few days, its not bad, on the top of a plateau &amp; we have to go down hill to get anywhere.  It wouldn't be bad if the weather had held fine.  I have had your letters quite regularly lately &amp; have loved them, you write just as you are.  Only one thing, I hate saying it but it sort of worries me so, if only you &amp; Miss Hilda wouldn't be sort of out of friends.  I don't really think she would mean to say nasty things about you to Mrs. Bettington.  You know you sometimes do <strike>run</strike> tread on people's corns (metaphorically of course) at times but I would take their going sore too hardly and you &amp; Miss Hilda are such pals that I hate to hear of anything like &amp; coolness.  Cos you'd both be so frightfully sorry if anything</p>
