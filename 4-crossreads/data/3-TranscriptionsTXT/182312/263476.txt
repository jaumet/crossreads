 of miles of these duckboard tracks in France; in fact&nbsp; in Winter 
 they are absolutely necessary where men have to travel off the 
 main hard roads. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us ffollow a Battalion into the tranches.&nbsp; An 
 officer and a couple of N.C.O&#39;s from each Company have gone up to 
 the line the night before to obtain full particulars as to how xx 
 it is held and the disposition of the troops in the various posts. 
 They return and are able to divide their Companies up accordingly 
 so that on arrival at the trenches each party can move to its 
 appointed place without confusion.&nbsp; A heavy frost is on and the 
 road is slippery so the men wrap a sandbag round each boot to help 
 them keep their feet.&nbsp; Steel helmets are chalked white so as not 
 show up against the snow.&nbsp; Rations and water being served all 
 round we push off.&nbsp; For a mile or so we follow the road and then 
 branch off on to a duck board track and here our troubles commence. 
 The duckboards are frozen and are very slippery.&nbsp; I used to think 
 that walking with carpet slippers on polished lino was a risky 
 matter, but frozen duckboards beat all.&nbsp; It is moonlight and the 
 duckboardx track shows up well across the snow as it winds about 
 dodging shell holes.&nbsp; Falls are frequent and the language is vile. 
 Once a man falls it requires a considerable struggle for him to get 
 to his feet again so great is the load on his back.&nbsp; After three or 
 four hours of walking and slipping we arrive at our area and each 
 party moves off to relieve the post to which it is allotted.&nbsp; Half 
 an hour goes by and then the report comes through &quot;relief complete&quot; 
 and we are left in possession of that section of the line whilst 
 the relieved Battalion winds its weary way back to the Camp from 
 which we came.&nbsp; Fortunately a few clouds had come over to obscure 
 the moon and the relief was accomplished with trifling casualities.
