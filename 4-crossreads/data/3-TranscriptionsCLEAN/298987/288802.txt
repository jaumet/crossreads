  
 noticed only one dead man. This is where the advance was 4 days ago. Marched untill 4.30 & were told to dig in in a railway cutting. Just got started when orders came to stop as a better place had been found about 1/4 of a mile on. It was evidently where the Infantry had dug in on the first night of the advance. Short bits of trench & holes big enough for 1 or 2 men Morrison & I got a piece of trench made it a bit larger & covered it with iron. Came through 2 little villages today all battered up also passed a railway dump where the Huns have left a lot of stuff also a big railway gun that had been captured. It had been used for shelling Amiens. Saw 3 of our Planes  that had been brought down & a damaged tank. Did not fell the march so much tonight as I had left a flannel shirt & pr of sox behind to lighten the load. We all camped near Arbiners & Aosiers 
 Monday 12th Were told to make our dugouts splinter
