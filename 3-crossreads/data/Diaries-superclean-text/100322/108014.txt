soon pulled out by Miles and Harold Smith with news that little Georgie Hughes, Freddy Howell, Jackie Cowan and young Binns were all in the A.P.M's clink at the Charleroi barracks! Quelle affaire! I went up with Gorman and ?Scotty" the 24th RSM and found it only too true. Interviewed the A.P.M and got his leave to see them. The doctor myself had no hesitation in pronouncing them all quite sober but (unofficially) Freddy Georgie were really very drunk ? so much so that I decided that they must stay in the place all night. So we left them there in a dark room under lock key with one lone wraith of the 42nd Division floating round in his white riding breeches chamois waistcoat like a nocturnal spectre!
