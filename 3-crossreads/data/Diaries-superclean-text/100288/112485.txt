property scooped into a bag thrown on the incinerator. Blankets rolled into bundles ready for transport tomorrow morning early.

Passed a very cold night through having to sleep without blankets; which was quite unnecessary as the other sections had the use of theirs. 
Turned out at 3.45 AM moved off at 4.45 AM with our packs up for the first time after a fairly sharp march of about 4  miles arrived at Moascoar at 6.40 AM. At once set to to pitch camp which took up the greater part of the day. Eventually we were allotted to our respective tents again settled down to await our departure from this country.
