<p>January, 1917. Friday 19<br/>Arrived on scene at 9.30 and party had been waiting since 8.30. Unloaded pontoons but couldn't get a train. At 3.30 about 8 all came in together and we had to knock off on account of congestion. Home at 4.30 and had a shave and a general clean up. Bed at 10. Still cold and plenty of snow.</p>
