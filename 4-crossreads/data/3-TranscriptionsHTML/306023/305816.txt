<p>[Note added at top of page, commenting on part of the text below:]<br/>6/5/19 Whittel was found out to be a German spy, but escaped to America where he has since been arrested. So I met one of the Continental (he was not an Aussie at all) villains one reads of.</p>
<p>the father took me all around Woolwich and showed me some of the arsenal, and the anti-aircraft defences.</p>
<p>I also called around to the chief people of the village who knew the boy, amongst whom were Lady Donaldson, whose husband went down with Kitchener, Sir Clarence Stuart, Bart. who lost about &pound;150 000 in a bogus company, controlling Australian exports some years back, the inventor of the under-sea cable, and a Mr Whittel an Australian too, who is the inventor of the gas incediary bombs which they are using so successfully against the Zeppelins, with whom I had a most interesting chat.</p>
<p>The tunnel at Woolwich, under the river is a great piece of work. It is rather small in diameter, though, but about a mile long, with a lift</p>
