c/o Sis.Exeter 20.12.16My dearest Father & Mother,
After a week in London, I arrived back here a few days ago to find your letters of 16th & 24th Octr (Mum 2 and Father 2) waiting for me, also Bulletin of 28.9.16 - The other papers I expect have been retained at the Battery.
You will probably be wondering why I haven't said anything about myself in my last letter, but truth to tell I am feeling so perfectly well that I almost forgot I had been off color. The attack of jaundice has quite disappeared and the foot is splendid - so I am feeling very bucked with myself and thinking I ought to be saying goodbye to this life of ease.
I am afraid my week in London was not spent quite as profitably as it might have been. First of all I was not in a mood
