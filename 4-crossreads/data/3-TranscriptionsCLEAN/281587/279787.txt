  
 he opened up on the Machine Gun Squadron, and for three hours kept up a pretty solid bombardment.  I never saw horses taken off the lines in better time than they were that night. 
 In about three minutes the lines were clear, and the horses and men well in a deep Wadi at the rear of the Camp.  Our horse lines were riddled with shell holes, and two tents blown sky high.  He did most excellent shooting.  I had some work to do around the Camp trying to get it cleaned up, as we were moving that night, but every time the nigger and I ventured out of shelter z-z-z-z-z-z-bang, another lot would come along.  He kept it up till sundown, and made things very lovely indeed.  A lot of horses were lost that day, and several Officers and men. 
 We moved out at about midnight and travelled all night, arriving at Talaat ed Dumm just after sunrise on the 17th.  Here we stayed until the night of the 19th when at about 7-30 we moved off again for Hebron Road, reaching our Camp about five or six miles above Solomon's Pools at daylight on the 20th.  Here the climate is beautiful.  It is nearly midsummer, yet the days are mild as a spring day in Australia.  There is green here too, and it is very restful to the eyes after the Jordan furnace. 
 22nd  It is rumoured that we are to move back to-morrow night to somewhere about Ludd, for a lengthy spell and then are going onto the coast front.  Everyone is sincerely hoping the rumour is true.  None want to see the Jordan Valley again. 
 24th   We moved, or commenced our move back,  last night  yesterday afternoon, going as far as  Tell el Dumm
