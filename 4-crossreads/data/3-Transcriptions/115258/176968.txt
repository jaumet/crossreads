<p>are now just in reserve. I rode down to Field Ambulance yesterday and saw the dentist about going back to Port Said to get my tooth fixed up. He says my gum is very nearly healed up enough so he will start and fix up for me to get leave. But I dont think I&#39;ll get away before about ten days as it takes some time to get appointments fixed up etc. The last few days have been rather hot here, even for this sultry clime, so the big shower bath here has been well patronised and has proved a great blessing because you do pespire so terribly here when it is really warm. The spring that supplies us with water for our horses and for these showers would be worth a lot of money at home, because it is such pure beautiful water and also the spring itself is down the wadi from where we are, but it is not in the wadi itslef as you&#39;d expect it to be, but right up on a rise at the foot of the mountains which run<s>s</s> parallel to the wadi</p>
