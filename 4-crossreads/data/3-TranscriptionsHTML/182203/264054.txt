<p>mother  &amp; keep mine. You can amuse yourself by taking a few snaps. Where you by the Films will teach you how to use it. I must write a few lines to dear old Mother now for her birthday. I've forgotten whose turn it is for letter, have packed my book, so it will do for the family.<br/>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all.
