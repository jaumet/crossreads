<p>Saturday night 29 June<br/>On night duty &ndash; second night.</p>
<p>As soon as I was finished this morning I cleaned up one or two concert party matters &amp; went to bed, arranging to be called for 2 oclock rehearsal.</p>
<p>Tom Beech forgot, however, &amp; and when I met Whent the younger later on, a suggestion about his desire to "chuck it in", ostensibly because of a postponed rehearsal (not necessary), but really because of some inherent strain in him which makes him annoyingly unreliable, I told him in plane language</p>
