I had a snak in the soldiers buffet at the station then went to the Tower where I spent a couple of very interesting hours. It is hard to specially mention any particular place. 
I then went to the "The Bank" to catch Richmond Bus (33) but was a bit off my track, but told by Policeman to take Hammersmith (9) then change, which I did, but I had to change again at Richmond to go to Kew Gardens (27) where I found I was very short of time as I had to be back at 9PM to Dartford. I spent nearly all my time in the hot houses which were very good. A very good show of Antimnes (white, blood, velvety red, white marked heliotropes, every shade of purple. A few orchids, fair carnations (a few) good, Date plum oranges have a little fruit. A small but good show of Liliums (Golden Ray etc.) Ferns very good. Fushias good. The ground cannot be looked after properly as labor is scarce, a few stocks but very poor
