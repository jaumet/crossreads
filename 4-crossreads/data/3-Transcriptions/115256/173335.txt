<p>Wednesday17 March 1915</p>
<p>A good instance of how a humorous incident will bring about an end to an awkward or difficult situation.  At breakfast this morning, there were a host of complaints regarding the food, an absence of butter, doughy bread etc.  The orderly officer, who endeavoured to pacify matters, was hooted, counted out and nearly shoved right out of the mess for his pains.  At any rate, the situation, in the hands of this highly disciplined Australian army was just beginning to get interesting and lively, when the beautiful harmony of the bagpipes broke right through the terrific noise of the uproar:  and "The Wearin' of the Green", played on bagpipes, mark you, simply brought the house down.  Then, roars of laughter, as a little procession, headed by the bagpipes, followed by the bearer of a emerald green flag and a bevy of happy sons of Erin, passes along the mess room.  It's certain that St. Patrick's Day is that same orderly officers lucky day!</p>
<p>This afternoon the battalion marched out at half past four on bivouac for the night.  At eight o'clock a halt was made, the blankets were distributed, sentries were posted, and the camp slept.  I wonder how many dreamt of France and of trenches as a change from Egypt and dust!</p>
