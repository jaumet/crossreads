<p>Monday 26th June 1916.<br/>From now on I will be unable to state the names of the towns &amp; villages in which we were billeted or visited. Eric arrived this morning. Although the advance party left first we beat them easily. Leave granted to all to visit the small village, it is indeed a very pretty place. A great treat living here after living in the sand. The inhabitants are a very homely &amp; kind folk. Met Capt. Ward, he is still a good sport &amp; very popular with the men. During the afternoon a small party of us visited the Cathedral. Inside was a tomb of the Duke of Morbecque 1263, 700 years ago. The statues in the Cathedral are magnificent &amp; splendour of the Altars is indescribable. The drapings are exquisite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the oil paintings on the wall are hundreds of years old &amp; are worth thousands of pounds. Outside the church we cam across a vault many hundreds of years old, the coffins were all smashed open rather a gruesome sight. I believe the vault was smashed on during the French Pruissian War.</p>
<p>Tuesday 28th June.<br/>Raining all through the night, looks like if it is set in for the week. Mud &amp; slush everywhere. Met some charming French girls who do their best to make our short stay in the village a pleasant one.</p>
<p>29th June.<br/>Pleasant route march this morning, very pretty country we marched through resembles the Moss Vale to Nowra trip. What a contrast to those marches in Egypt.</p>
<p>30th June.<br/>Gas Helmet practice, a most important part of a training as a great number of casualties have occurred during Gas attacks etc.</p>
<p>- to July 5th .<br/>Plenty of rain. Preparations for moving off to a new destination. Goggles &amp; two Gas Helmets issued to each man.</p>
