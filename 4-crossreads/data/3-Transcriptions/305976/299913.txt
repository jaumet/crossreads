<p>Wednesday Sept 5<br/>Derrick Hudson rode over today from Canunis[?]. He is attached to Div Train. Says he is on a good wicket. We were surprised at four Camels being sent over for us to return to camp at once. I suppose our good time is finished now. Arrived at camp at 5 pm &amp; found that Tom had made a fine bivvy during my absence. What a fine pal he is.<br/>Thursday Sept 6<br/>On night duty. Afternoon football match between our unit &amp; Scottish Horse result S.H. 4.0<br/>Friday Sept 7<br/>Another scorcher today. Snakes &amp; scorpions fairly plentiful in this quarter. Water some miles away so we are limited</p>
