<p>Friday. Sept. 21st  [contd]  Fritz is shelling like Hell &amp; our chaps are getting knocked all over the place.  Bert Berry was wounded in the Head &amp; back.  Smee got a small piece of shell in the back of the neck.  Roy Wooler got a knock in the knee, &amp; Dickson was wounded.  Bradley is missing &amp; his case looks serious, as his Pay Book &amp; Steel mirror were picked up with a shell hole through 'em.  We missed him when we arrived at the Pill Box, but thought  he had only lost his way.</p>
<p>22 Batt. M.O. relieved the 28th <br/>Capt. Orr. About 7,  the 22 Batt. Med. Off. &amp; his details changed over, &amp; made this as uncomfortable as they could for us. <br/> We put in a couple of hours trying to clean up the place.  It was in an awful mess.  There was about 2 feet of water on the Floor &amp; it stank awfully.  The dead Fritz's outside were beginning to "pong" &amp; we were very pleased when the Pioneers came along &amp; buried them.  There was a German Red x chap went through, wounded.  He was in the dug out when we took over.  He gave me his Medical Outfit, which I was going to bring back as a souvenir, but somebody got down on it, as they also did to a trench dagger I got from a Pill Box away over from ours.  We were well supplied with rations, but it was hard not being able to light a Fire &amp; make some Tea.</p>
