  
 I had dug down a fair depth when I felt a bang on the head something like as if a clod of earth had been thrown and at the same time the tin helmet was knocked on to my nose giving it a nasty bump. I was bending at the time and with my back towards the side and on examination found that a bullet had struck my helmet fairly low, gone right through and being deflected upwards by the steel had passed out again at the top making a very jagged rent and without touching my head. It was a very narrow escape and the helmet undoubtedly saved my life so I carefully replaced it after drawing Tonkins attention and thenceforth worked on my knees. At 4 A.M. we all retired to our trench and stood to for an hour just at dawn as a counter attack was likely. However they seemed too demoralised and I was next McKay who noticed my had and I explained and he offered me a cigarette which I gratefully took. Shelling was still going on. Then returned to our work of making the trench level and serviceable and at 10 A.M. were allowed to take half an hour for breakfast. My water bottle was nearly 1/4 full and seeing a chap of the 3rd section going to get water  we  he volunteered to take ours and he wasn't much of a character as he lost himself and incidentally our water bottles and we didn't see him again till we got to Albert. We stopped about 11.30 and lay down dog tired in a trench and slept till about 3 when we got up and secured some bacon and a small piece of bread for dinner. Shelling of our trench recommenced and lasted about 3/4 of an hour and then gradually slackened off and at 4 P.M. we stood to again and after 5 did some more digging. The ground right through had been rather difficult as flint stones proved a nuisance. At 6.15 P.M. we got orders to retire and went to our dump and deposited our tools and marched or rather ambled to the main road where after 5 minutes spell we got on our pontoons which had come up and went home arriving about nine after getting cigarettes and cheerful words on the way. We couldn't find our billet for sometime but at length got it and getting our blankets and kit bags from about 1/4 mile away went to bed late and slept the sleep of the exhausted. 24/7/16 Got up late and after fair meal Tonkin and I had a good bath  our  next our billet in a bucket of water. our billet fairly comfortable and slept in second story on a floor. While we had our bath the Germans sent over some big shrapnel and high explosive shells landing very close to our billet and continued intermittently. I got a fine parcel from Auntie Sarah. Rested in the afternoon and at 8 P.M. moved out again to our paddock as shelling  was  might have happened that night and our big guns were firing in the village. Retired at 10 P.M. and artillery very active on our front. During whole time weather was very fine and my health excellent. Error:- our operations were not yet carried out at Gordon Dump but in Sausage Valley all the time.
