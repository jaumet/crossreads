 Tuesday 23 February 1915 
 Only a short parade this morning &ndash; a little training in "Company in attack" and then we returned to camp.  An inspection of feet was held later &ndash; a most necessary and frequent measure in an infantry force.  Then a solution of Condy's Fluid was supplied, and after bathing their feet in this, the men were ordered to rest in their tents until 4 p.m.  At 3.45 the "quarter" or the "warning for parade" sounded, and shortly afterwards, the battalion fell in and was marched out for a pleasant evening in the sand.  Going along merrily for about four miles, we reached a slight rising in the ground.  Here we ate the evening meal which had previously been issued and then proceeded to entrench ourselves against an imaginary enemy.  Outposts were told off and sentries were posted &ndash; a full dress rehearsal for the real thing.  After a time, we got word that the "enemy" had shifted their position, and we commenced a long tramp across the sand in pursuit.  However, they managed to elude us, and after a number of hour's weary wandering in the wilderness (a la Israel) we reached camp considerably after midnight, throughly tired, as a result of the evening work.  One advantage, its much cooler than working in the day.
