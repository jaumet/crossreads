My dear Mother and FatherWe are off to the desert tomorrow - Have been transfered to the machine gun squadron and will be attached to the 1st Brigade of which the 1st Regt is a part.  Nearly the whole of us here were put into this squadron, so I am with all my mates including Bill Graham.I got your letter of the 22nd June on Saturday also the Kerchief & leather but I did not get a letter telling me about taking delivery of the car which I expect you wrote.I am writting this in the Dr's tent waiting for final enoculation, we were only told this evening that we were going and we had to be on train at seven in morning.  Our kit bags are to be sent to the kit store
