<p>1917<br/>In England. Part II</p>
<p>August 27th:- At Rollestone Camp Salisbury Plain. Left Liverpool by rail for this place at noon yesterday, and en route received many demonstrations of welcome, especially from women and girls. Hardly an <strike>elligible</strike> eligible civilian <strike>man</strike> could be seen in any of the cities through which we passed &ndash; Wolverhampton, Warwick, Stafford, Birmingham, Oxford, and Basingstoke at Birmingham troops rushed the refreshments rooms seeking a glass or two of liquor they* not having tasted any for nine weeks. They waved above their heads Commonwealth pound and ten shilling note in their anxiety to pay for a drink. Only three <strike>men</strike> women were serving; they became very excited muddled the change, and refused to accept the Australian silver tended in payment. We detrained at the little town of Amesbury at 7 P.M. <strike>last night. (Sunday night).</strike> It was raining heavily when we started to march through the town. After a tramp of seven miles in full equipment <strike>and</strike> with pack up, we arrived at the 5th Training Battalion encampment, situated about two miles from Stonehenge. No arrangements had been made to receive us; we were not expected. We were huddled into some huts, got a couple of blankets per man, a drop of cold tea, and a bit of stew. We then went to sleep under wet clothes at midnight.</p>
<p>* most of them; there were a few who had, they being friends of the crew and "in the know".</p>
