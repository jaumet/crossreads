<p>Dear Mum, This is the same sort of scene that we see in Cairo. You will notice the box of oranges &amp; the rugs &amp; shawls hanging on the wall. All the native quarters are like this. You will notice also the big lamp. These show a great light at night time. There are miles after miles of streets in Cairo like these. We are still having a fairly good time. We have been to most of the of the sights &amp; are content now to lie down in the Park or to stop in our Recreation Room. We have some friends in Cairo now &amp; we can visit them once a week &amp; have a nice homely meal.<br/>Love From Harry</p>
