 Apparently there was an air raid on London this morning at 11.45. I saw the shells from Archies bursting but not the planes. Rumour says that Bank Cannon St Ludgate Hill were bombed but know nothing of casualties.
 Went before a board this morning I suppose I will soon be going convalescent. 
 Major Wilson his wife have just been in they tell me that poor Reg Shergold has died of wounds.
