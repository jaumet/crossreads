5/9/15    Put Pioneers on to dig latrines but unfortunately at about 3 feet they dug up some English tommies corpses & trying again found a patch of others. Eventually found a clear space. The batteries have opened fire over our heads and the shells can be heard "whizz" over head. We anticipate a reply soon & will have a lively time. Capt Curnow dropped in, went round back of Courtneys Post & Steels lookout with him and were fired on by Turkish snipers. Went to his dugout and had a drink. Returned to Camp, sharing large dugout with Major Smith.
