<p>We are very comfortable here &amp; should like very much to be on the Staff here but no such luck.<br/>Last Monday had a busy day at Headquarters, pay-office etc.<br/><u>Tuesday</u>, shopped in the morning, had luncheon at a large shop named Selfridges. Then went to Westminster Abbey &amp; it took all the afternoon &amp; then felt as if we had only passed through. It is a most wonderful place &amp; of course full of interest, so sorry  I cannot go into detail but hope to do so when I return. Some of the very old momuments are covered up with sand-bags to protect them from the air-raids. It would be an awful thing if the old Abby was distroyed. We also saw The Westminster Cathedral (R.C.) which is a beautiful building, not yet finished. Had dinner at "Fleming's Restaurant" &amp; enjoyed it &ndash; we have fearful appetites &amp; are enjoying civilized food again.<br/><u>Wednesday</u> went out to Harefield Park</p>
