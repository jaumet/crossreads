1916   SATURDAY 19   FEB.
Very windy & dusty. On the guns again in morning. I spent most of the morning taking a breech block to pieces and putting it together again. There are 23 pieces in it and not one screw, every piece fits perfectly. Came into Lisheen in afternoon. Eileen went to the Kings after tea. Mrs Lloyd's eyes were very bad, as she  had had them treated in the morning. Linda & Self yarning over the front gate.
Jo went out to Mrs Macdonald's in afternoon for tea
