<p>Sunday 11 March 1917</p>
<p>Went Cairo to Hospitals to see wounded &amp; sick. Am sure the change will have done you &amp; (MARTHA as Daisy is) good &amp; JOE must find the monotony killing at times, he &amp; you all are doing more in your way than we are who live an exciting life.</p>
<p>Met me know if you get the Turk's revolver &amp; the photos I send by Capt. PEARSE of Pastoralists Review. I ran into STANLEY BRAIM at Heliopolis Hotel last night, he is I think drinking more than is good for him, I am afraid. I will write Eleanor but don't tell her this.</p>
