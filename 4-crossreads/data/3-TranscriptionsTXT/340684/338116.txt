 Dearest Joker and Bobbie Just a few lines to let you know I am out of bed again. The operation last Wednesday wasn't  very bad &ndash; The doctor just made an incision in the eye to let some liquid out and bound the eye up and sent me to bed &ndash; This week he will remove the cataract and bind both eyes up and send me to bed for 10 days which doesn't sound very cheerful &ndash; I am looking forward so much to seeing you both this week. I hope you will be able to come up. Aunt Maria sent me a wonderful assortment of chocolates, peppermint creams and buiscuits from the Civil Service Stores &ndash; I'm not supposed to read or write so better shut up &ndash; Cheer Oh and much love to every body Gibson
