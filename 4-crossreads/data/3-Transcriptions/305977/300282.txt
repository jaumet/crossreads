<p>November 1915<br/>Turkish position in one night.  Several times we heard the Turks yell when one got home.  On Thursday night the Queenslanders (5 LH) advanced their line on the extreme right &amp; met with some opposition from the Turks.  Things were fairly lively for a couple of hours, bombs mostly being used.  The Turks must have had a good few casualties the 5th had 3 killed &amp; 12 wounded.  The Turks gave us a bit of a shelling on Friday &amp; at night time we proceeded to make it hot for the Turks  Several were blown to pieces with bombs.  Our artillery howitzers &amp; field guns also took a hand.  On Saturday morning the 5th LH had a good line of trench &amp; barbed wire out.  Saturday night bombs were used principally &amp; the destroyer also shelled the enemy's trenches  Sunday morning both our guns &amp; the enemy's opened up, but most of the Turks shells fell short.  Some were indeed much closer</p>
