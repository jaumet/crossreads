<p>at Kensington, pleased to see one of Melbournes beauties.</p>
<p>Sunday 9th March  My last day in London.  Left hotel about midday and went to Earls Court for dinner after which strolled through Kensington Gardens &amp; Hyde Park having tea at the Corner House.  Said goodbye to D.W.A.  &amp; went to Waterloo where I caught the train to Dinton, walking from there to Fovant. Arrived about 11 p.m..</p>
<p>Monday 10th March  Found the camp much as I had left it very few having gone away.  Idled the day away and went to the pictures at night.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11th March  Nothing doing all day.  Went to a lecture at the Y.M. at night on Alsace Lorraine, part was OK but the usual trash about Nurse Cavell etc. spoilt it.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12th March  A cold change.  A stroll during the morning and by the fire during the afternoon passed the day.  Reading and playing Quoits the medicine.  Concert at night by the Attractives quite a good show.</p>
