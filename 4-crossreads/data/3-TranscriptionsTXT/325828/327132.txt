 No 7 Trng Squadron, Aust. Flying Corps. Leighterton. Glos. Eng. 24.11.18 
 My dearest Father, I am rather behind in writing this time but I have been kept busy one way and another.  Since I last wrote I have received Anna's letter which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I have now finished my training here and have now attained my chief objective: namely my brevet, &amp; incidentally my commission.  Of course it is all very well having the commission for I feel as though I have earned it, but I am genuinely proud of my "Wings." When I do find my commission a nuisance though is when I am out with Els; strolling along  wh  with her arm on mine &amp; meeting &amp; acknowledging soldiers salutes; for the British Tommy is religiously regimental. I have applied and have been accepted as a member of the R.A.C. of Great Britain (Royal Aero Club).  It is they who issue the Peace-time Aviator's certificate, which together with the Military Certificate are rather good assets. Exactly what is going to become of us I don't know at present but I believe we will have to sign on in the A.F.C for 3 years.  There is a wild rumour here that we will be home for Easter but I am very dubious about it myself. I have to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of &amp;pound10 that I cabled for about a month ago.  It was very acceptable just at the time although now I hope to keep strictly within my pay I am doing very little flying at present owing to the limited number of machines here at present.  I have been testing machines here lately as soon as they come out of the workshops. Sometimes it is ticklish work, but I make sure of my engine on the ground before taking off.  It is great experience because of the different types of machines one comes into contact with. The weather here has been very dud lately as far as flying goes; low mist on the ground till about 10 o'clock, &amp; then it comes up foggy about 3; it becomes dark soon after 4 now &amp; then a very long evening. Next time I write I hope to be able to send you my latest photo, taken in my Lieutenant's rig-out. I must close now, with love to you all at home, Your loving son, J Leo L. Waterhouse.
