"Dinkum Oils"
The "dinkum oils" come pouring in,Morning noon and night;Startling news of every kind,All about the fight.Heres a sample of the kind,Given by those who know,Based on a batman's whisper soft,Then Rumour's on the go
Russians Capture twenty towns;Five thousand tommies killed;No recruits are offering now,'Cause their feet are chilled.No more houses to be cleaned;Leave to Ireland stopped;No more beer is sold to troopsDage's [?] cut and chopped
We are going home quite soon
