 My dear Mother 
 How does this strike you? Some class! N&#39;est pas? (They most of them talk French here you know). Yes and I&#39;m really at this address - Got my long expected leave at last and it is Sunday morning and nice and cool and I have just come back from service and Communion at St Marks church and am waiting for lunch and feel very clean and nice and happy and just a little home sick. I&nbsp;was up in Cairo for a couple of days and was thinking of going down to Luxor but everybody said it would be so hot down there; and I had just come from old Jericho heat and they all said how nice the sea was down here, so I came and it is lovely here. When in Cairo I went and saw Miss Harnett also Miss McConnicky and they gave me the Pastrol Review with the photos of home in it which I had not received and I was able to read that article about what jolly fine people we were! But of course I always knew it.
