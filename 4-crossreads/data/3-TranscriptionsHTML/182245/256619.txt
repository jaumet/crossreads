<p>14 SATURDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; fairly warm. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all day, &amp; I got mine</p>
<p>all clean again. We were to</p>
<p>go up to the battery position</p>
<p>to draw amunition at</p>
<p>night but that was cancelled</p>
<p>We went down the road to</p>
<p>an Estaminet after tea &amp; spent</p>
<p>the evening there. All our</p>
<p>guns came down at night.</p>
