 March, 1915 Friday 26 Today we fought the New Zealanders back to camp, across a  petrified forest  ; each tree plainly turned to stone, thrown up no doubt in the past years &amp; years ago. Had a quick drink at Moses Well where he tapped the rock &amp; made the water flow. On arrival in Camp found letters from Mother 27/2/15 please remember I am now 1st Regiment Light Horse not Reinforcements &amp; not 6th Regiment but Acting Adjutant 1st  don't  put in Acting adj just address Lieut Weir 1st LHAIF as I sent you some time back but expect my letters are stopped or crossed.
