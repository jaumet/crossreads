 I saw a man lifted fairly into the air by a shell &amp; hurled down the hill. What happened to him I don't know, but  I  somebody said he wasn't badly injured. 
 At last by frantic signal  was  a signaller passed word of what was happening on, and now our own fire is passing just nicely overhead onto the ridge where the Turks are. The line is rather crowded so I have made myself a comfortable little dug out beneath the crest &amp; can watch the enemies shrapnel bursting over near the beach. 
 5.30 p m. Still alive. It has been a very trying day &amp; my head is throbbing with the firing &amp; concussion of the shells. We are much troubled with snipers who find their way in on our flank. A few minutes ago, a poor chap along near me to whom I was talking stopped one in the ear. He isn't dead, but very nearly so. Another time a shrapnel, I think a chance one, caught four of our chaps just in front of me. All are badly wounded one or two I am afraid fatally. They were pretty smashed up, three of them in the head.
