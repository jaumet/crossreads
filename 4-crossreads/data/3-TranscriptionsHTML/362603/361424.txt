<p>10.  Many letters to answer- We cannot answer them all.  I now have to send P.C's.  We work pretty hard &amp; after being stuck round this place all day, it is maddening to sit down &amp; write letters.  When I've finished I put on my cap &amp; clear away from the place, up on to the Hills &amp; awa'.  I then forget all worries &amp; come back able to sleep well &amp; in a happy mood.  I have dozens of letters to answer &amp; write but I absolutely cannot do it.  After trying to get leave for a month Dave &amp; I have at last been granted 4 days.</p>
