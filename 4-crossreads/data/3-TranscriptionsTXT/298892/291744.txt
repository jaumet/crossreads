France,Wednesday 1st August 1917.
My Dear Parents/.You will be pleased to hear that I have left hospital and re-joined my Battallion. It appearsthat I was exceptionally fortunate in being away as they were holding a particularly rough section of the front and they had to put up with innumerable inconveniences and hardships. I am assured that it is the livliest portion on the whole Western front just at present and judging by the worn out appearance of the men and the heavy list of casualties I can quite believe it.Well the day I returned the Battalion came out of the line and I understand that we will not be going into the trenches on the same front again. The whole Division is due for a spell and I believe we are to get it. Rumour says we are to recuperate on the sea coast. I hope it may prove correct as at this time of year such a change would be very acceptable.
I was delighted on my return to find two letters from mother and several papers awaiting me. Your statement that the back yard was entrenched awaiting the planting of rose trees astonished me. Surely father hasn't extended his garden to the back yard. Why the number of beds in the front alone would be sufficient to keep a gardener busy all day. Especially when the cutting of the grass &c is included. It must be a great tax on him keeping the place beautiful with flowers.
