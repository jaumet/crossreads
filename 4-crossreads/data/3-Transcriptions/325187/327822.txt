<p>[Friday 17 March 1916]</p>
<p>Went to Dinner again at another Pashas, &amp; found the same round table had been carted per pack Donk from our recent Host.  Evidently only the <strike>only</strike>  one Table in District- Bedouins feed on the floor- &amp; tear the food with hands<br/> At one village Collected a 16 bore Shot gun &amp; 20 Cartridges, the latter we were informed were to shoot quail etc: but on opening found they were loaded with Siran drop, the very largest shot made.<br/>Cartridges were filled for man hunting I think.<br/>A bag of newspapers were lost in one of the Canals, Donk fell in- rotten luck, a man has a lot of luck to get his mail at this game &amp; when it does arrive he appreciates it.</p>
