<p>1916 &nbsp; WEDNESDAY 14 &nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>A murky dull day but as there was no wind it was not too cold. The 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Brigade &amp; a few of our fellows went ashore in morning for a route march. I had a buzzer lecture in morning, and M<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Neylan set up a helio for us but we got no practice with it. A lot of the fellows went our for a row in afternoon the rest had a tug of war on the promenade deck. Sent a cable to Linda &amp; asked her to reply so ought to get an answer tomorrow. The 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;played [little?] hell on shore &amp; most of them came back drunk &amp; lots did not come back at all.</p>
