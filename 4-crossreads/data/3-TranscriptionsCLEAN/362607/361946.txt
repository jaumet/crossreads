 Dear George, I walked through this gate. The Cathedral & all the Clerical Lodgings are in the close or wall. A High Wall runs all round, and everyone has to walk till one of these gates appears in the wall. They are all shut at 9 pm. This Cathedral is the most famous in the church of England because the present Book of Common Prayer was made up mostly from the Book of Sarum, which Town is about a mile & half from the present Cathedral where the original was.  Love Harry
