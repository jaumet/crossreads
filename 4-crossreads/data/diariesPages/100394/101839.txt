July 29 Am up at forward observation post again today but had a very quiet day. 40£ and a month’s furlough are offered for a German sniper dead or alive who is operating on our side of the trenches. 40£ is also offered any man who can capture a live German star shell. They are much superior to ours and fired by compressed air.

Got back this morning about 9 a.m. and found cablegram in regard to money waiting for me. I was on duty tonight and managed to write some letters. I understand we are in our winter quarters here now. The position might be better and might be worse. I daresay we will settle down comfortably though. Our aeroplanes are very active here always one or two up.

On Saturday the 29th the Germans blew down a large Church in Fleurbaix about a mile from here. They had been after it for a long time but didn’t seem able to get the range. We fired about 40 shells into a German anti-aircraft battery this afternoon and forced them to move their position. Posted letters home, Mrs Fountain Arthur Preston, Charley Montague and Dorrie. The Germans use some most peculiar shells sometimes, especially delayed action shell designed to penetrate dugouts or gun pits before exploding. They caught quite a number of our coves at first as they would think they were duds and rush over to dig them out and get caught in the explosion.
