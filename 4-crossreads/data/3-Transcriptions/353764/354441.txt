<p>to-day was feeling very queer &amp; had severe pains in the Head.  I also began to get feverish &amp; perspired profusely, so late last night I went to the Hospital &amp; was treated by a friend of Uncle Charlies.  He asked me if I had ever had Malaria Fever &amp; said that he thought I had a mild form if it, but that I was to report back again if I felt worse.<br/>He gave me some Cooling Powders to take during the night &amp; they have done me the world of good.  You will no doubt rouse when you hear this as I do not intend to tell you of it, as it would only worry you.</p>
<p>This morning one of the latest Aeroplanes flew just over the top of our tents &amp; we had a fine view of it. They are a very large type of Machine &amp; also particularly powerful.<br/>I was offered a Warrant Officers job in the Supply at Serapeum to-day &amp; refused it, as I don't want to go there until I have to, more over it is a clerical job &amp; I would much rather be with the men.  In any case I have been promised a Warrant in the Transport in a few weeks time, which will suit my books much better.</p>
