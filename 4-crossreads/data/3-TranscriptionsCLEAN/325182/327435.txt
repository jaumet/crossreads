  
 2nd Left Pernois by lorry at 5 p.m. and reached the Bn. at St. Vaast  about 6.30 p.m. where I was cordially greeted by old faces.  Was posted to A Coy. with 2nd Lieut Dodimead.  I found that Arthur Wheen had been promoted from Cpl. to Commissioned rank with a second bar to his Military Medal, and that he had been appointed Signal officer.  So that I have a very worthy successor.  I am in charge of No. 4 Platoon now. 
 3rd We did a little Coy. training this morning.  This afternoon all four of us A Coy. officers went into Vignacourt
