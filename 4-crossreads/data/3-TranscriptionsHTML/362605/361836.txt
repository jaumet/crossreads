<p>When returning to camp next morning which was Strike day, I got on the wrong train &amp; was landed 8 miles the other way from Salisbury.  By walking &amp; jumping A.S.C. wagons &amp; lorries etc I got back to Sarum for dinner.  At 3pm I set out the other 11 miles to Bulford &amp; by the same method of transport I got Home at 4.15 pm &amp; just in time for Tea.  It was a nice day though the snows which had fallen the previous day still lay on the ground &amp; I fully enjoyed a day from work &amp; worry.</p>
