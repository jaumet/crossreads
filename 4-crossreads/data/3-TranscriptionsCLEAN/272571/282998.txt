  
 Outside of the village the inevitable game of pitch and toss is being played by the troops, especially the Aussies, for large sums of money. Nothing less than notes being taken. One Greek youth was playing at an anchor board. He was only about fourteen years of age, and he had won about thirty bets without a loss.  Others spent there time playing football and the usual excitement reminded one of Saturday afternoon games at home. During the forenoon D.R.I. went through the Egyptian camp. They are a labour corps helping to make roadways on the island. They look a dirty, miserable, set of individuals and are of all ages. They are dressed in the most grotesque manner imaginable. It seems that they pick up any old piece of clothing that they find lying about and wear it. The result is one sees them going about dressed up in old pyjama suits, Overcoats blankets etc and these, in conjunction with their own native dress make them look ridiculous in the extreme. Their chatter, chatter all the time they are working makes one wish them far enough away. A big number of them have died here. We passed their graveyard, each grave being marked by stones gathered from round about.  A general air of jollity is prevailing about the camp to-day.
