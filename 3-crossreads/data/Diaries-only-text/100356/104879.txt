Up at same time as usual.
Nothing much to do today, in the morning only did a little wheatstone in the afternoon, a large sports meeting was held at the Canal Company's grounds was an entire success although a member of the British W Indies Regt got nearly all the races he was a real beaut had lovely action although none pushed him, in the evening a concert under the patronage of about 6 generals also took place, this also was fine especially the music, supplied by one of the Infantry bands, the Mysore lancers gave a couple of turns which were very well received considering.
Bed at midnight.
