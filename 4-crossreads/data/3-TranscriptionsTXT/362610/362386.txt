 Monday 19 June 1916 A fine day &amp; again very quiet. Some "straffing" with trench mortars &amp; artillery during the day but some little distance from us. Last night was again very cold &amp; disturbed by a pretty severe little bombardment fairly close to us : it was reported, too, that gas had again been used. The day was a decidedly cold one.
