 July, 1915 Tuesday 6 The "Kiwi" Lancers as the L.H. were called are now in "Shorts" &amp; "Puttees" I send you a snapshot of myself a la Tommy -  We could do with all the good station men from the Back country -. MEN ARE WANTED, not writers or Boozers   Sorry I cannot give you more Military News but dare not so keep off the Topic, but we are  not  progressing as we should &amp; there are so many poor fellows crippled &amp; broken for life &ndash; Nothwithstanding our  men give the Turks Gramophone Selections at times, trenches only 20 yards apart then Hell. Poor light Horse what a difference from what we expected. However, more power to us to be able to do it.
