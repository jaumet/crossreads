 7/7/19 "Chemnitz" &ndash; Devonport see the Embarkation Staff and at 10.00 Captn Harrison &amp;  Grose and Commdr Hewitt RN came aboard. Went all over the ship with them and at 11 am the train arrived with 500 of the troops aboard. They were soon stowed away in their decks and given lunch. A second lot came at 3 amid rain and then some more at 5. The latter included 40 released prisoners from Lewes gaol of whom 6 were in close arrest and forthwith put into the cells behind iron bars. Great bustle and excitement all day and further inspections with an imposing train. In the evening most of the troops turned in early being tired out with their long journey. The Prince Ludwig alongside and the Freidricksran (taking Hughes tomorrow) also close.
