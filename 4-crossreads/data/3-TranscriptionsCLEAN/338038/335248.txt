of defence & handling of his artillery & machine guns is too good. However, enough of war!
We are just on the point of being relieved & going into billets at the rear for a spell. We shall be out a few weeks and - (I say it with hushed breath) I may find myself crossing the old channel for a few days. I have written to Sis & told her that I may get a chance of a trip, so hope I wont be stopped.
This billeting arrangement is a most excellent idea. All the men have comfortable weather proof  quarters, and baths etc abound in plenty. I was quite surprised to find that the weather could be so hot in these parts. The last few days have be most oppressive.
Have not seen any of the old hands lately as we are detached from our Infantry at present. Saw Maurice Lenehan a week
