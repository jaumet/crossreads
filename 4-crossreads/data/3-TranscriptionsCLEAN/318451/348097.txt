 Sat. 24 Weather fine.  Had splendid Ch. parade today, about 450 men.  Spoke on "The Sword of the Lord & of Gideon". 
 Sunday Our Batt. went in this morning.  I had a service in the Stables at the Transport with the men, mules, & horses.  I hope I succeeded in reforming some of them.  It doesn't matter which class for I think none are perfect.  They are a good lot of boys & appreciate these services. Our clocks & watches were put on an hour today. Went into the trenches this evening. 
 Monday Cold, snowing, showery.  Went to Batt. H.Q. & up to town this afternoon.  Heavy firing on our left all night.  At Plugstreet. 
 Tuesday Squally, very cold with snow this morning.  Very heavy firing on our left again last night.
