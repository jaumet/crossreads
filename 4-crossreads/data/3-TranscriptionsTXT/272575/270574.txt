About a week ago one blew along our way in the small hours of the morn.   I happened to wake early and lay in bed watching the Lightning in the West,   Some of our planes were also watching it, they had been out somewhere over Fritz's side, and were making for home when I saw them.  I got out of my shelter to watch them fighting their way through the storm, and I was rather glad that I was not a bird man, "they get a rather rough time if caught in a storm, but that is one of the chances they have to take, and if it is bad for our fellows, it must be worse for fritz, for judging from the way our planes keep his back in good weather, our machines are well in the lead, or else our Pilots are, we see them passing over in little squadrons of from 7 to 14, and I have counted over 30 coming back from his side, I fancy they were bombers.   They are fine machines and often give us some very fine exhibitions, of manouvering, etc.
