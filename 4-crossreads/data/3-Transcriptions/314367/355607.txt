<p>By the way we had Grace before &amp; after dinner on Sunday &ndash; I was late &amp; only got the latter &ndash; It was 'Thank God' &ndash; In view of our restricted diet I have suggested another one 'We are not worthy &ndash; O Lord &ndash; of the least of these thy mercies' I heard this somewhere &amp; it comes in handy &ndash; now &ndash;<br/>One officer &ndash; comes across to my room &ndash; 2-3 times a day &amp; his invariable remark coming or going is &ndash; 'It's a hell of a life going to sea isn't it Doctor?' To which I invariably reply &ndash; Thank God I'm only a volunteer for the war &ndash; I certainly would not care to be tied down to the Navy but as a volunteer in war time I'm enjoying it immensely &ndash; "Such a wonderful service' 'So splendidly paid' 'Such an easy life' says Mr Bumpus</p>
<p>Friday Dec 18-14 &ndash;  "With our sick beneath the awnings on our road to Mandalay" On Wednesday eveg. I quoted this to our Commander &ndash; He &amp; I &ndash; the chief engineer - &amp; the navigating  lieutenant all lay  horizontal  on the poop deck &ndash; The paymaster was stretched out below &amp; a cook &amp; a steward forward &ndash; What happened? All went well until the Wednesday morning &ndash; We had prayers &ndash; quarters &amp; at 10.30 I was aft in the Commander's cabin &ndash; Soon after I felt sick &ndash; I attributed this to the motion of the Screws &ndash; Shortly after I had to leave &amp; became violently sick &amp; curiously enough got no relief which you always do in seasickness &ndash;</p>
