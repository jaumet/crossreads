<p>14/1/16<br/>Put on parties sorting the mail and received a big batch myself. The Regtl Office full of bags and parcels &amp;c. the reinforcements 260 in number were taken over this afternoon and drafted to their companies. Most of them are smart looking chaps and alert and will be an acquisition. Messing in the QM's tent with the Major &amp; Padre. This place is close to a fresh water canal and the masts of the vessels look as if growing out of the ground. Plenty of palms and other vegetation round, and cool (almost cold) weather made conditions very pleasant.</p>
<p>Our mule drivers are back here once more having been up as far as Salonika. Rumoured H.J. Smith is coming back as B.M. tomorrow we lay out the Camp again. Big orderly room, two men uncoupled the train they were travelling in and were sent for Courtmartial. Simonson among the reinforcements and will very likely transfer to 14th. Battn. General Monash being his Brigadier and his uncle.</p>
<p>Held a mess meeting in the evening and decided to get as homelike as possible. Jakey sent some very good photos. The old trenches of Tel el Kebir are not far from here and relics can be dug up there. Turned in on floor at 2000 and read for a while. It gets very cold towards morning and the climate with heavy dews in unfavourable for sleeping out.</p>
