<p>to get out to Aust. for a little time.</p>
<p>Five of us (Sisters) were out to afternoon tea at Fred's camp on Friday &amp; we had quite an exciting time, had a ride to the Ferry in a Limber-cart returning &ndash; Going we were driven in an Ambulance cart.  If the photos are any good I shall send you them.  I've got some being developed now &amp; I'm just dying to see what they are like.  One, especially of The Prince of Wales, hope it is good.</p>
<p>Poor little chap had a bad time with the Cameras.  He visited the hospital one day, so everybody, who had a camera tried to get a Snap of him.  General Birdwood was with him, we all simply love The General, he has such a nice smile.  The little Prince is very fair &amp; good looking, but oh, such a boy. He spoke to the patients so nicely but seemed rather bashful.  I don't know where he is now, l fancy he has left here.  Fred shook hands with him, when he inspected his regiment.  Sister Martin is going back</p>
