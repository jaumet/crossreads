<p>&amp;in places there are great bare white patches showing on the hillsides, from the chalk country we got on to the famous Downs the home of the Southdown sheep &amp; it is lovely country, finer you will never see, the roads too are something splendid, there is scarcely a hole in them big enough to put a half crown in, we crossed the Arun" river twice through here she is not very big, not as big as the Coal river but runs fairly fast, they say the fishing in it is pretty good.<br/>All the stock through here were rolling fat &amp; looked well.<br/>Cycling seems to be very popular among the girls round this part I saw scores of them on their bikes riding about the roads.</p>
