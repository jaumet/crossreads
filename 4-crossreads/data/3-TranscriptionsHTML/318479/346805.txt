<p>10 April<br/>Monday.  Enter trenches.</p>
<p>13 April<br/>We have been in the trenches, 3 days.  It rained all the first two days but today is fine giving us a chance to dry our clothes.  Our duty is in the supports.  We also do guard at night and carrying the Coys rations.  This is a quiet firing line with very little rifle shooting.  The enemy is 500 yds. away.  We have been shelled a bit today, 1 killed, &amp; 2 wounded.</p>
<p>14 April<br/>Wet day.</p>
<p>15 April<br/>We are relieved by the 19th and march out at dark to billets in Armentiers.</p>
<p>16 April<br/>Resting in the billets.  1 Fine day.</p>

<p>19 April<br/>Move into the trenches, more rain.  Had trouble getting a dug out &ndash; finally got one with another individual &ndash; very comfortable &ndash; a good deal of shelling during the afternoon.
