<p>Thursday 27 April 1916<br/>A glorious day, distinctly warm in the sun. Went to the dentist in the morning, most of the time being taken up thus. Busy censoring &amp;c. during the afternoon. An aeroplane marked with British symbol passed over at a great height following the same course as the one that came on Easter Monday : we suspected it as a German. In the evening, as Guest Evening of the mess we had 5 nurses from the American Hospital over &amp; spent a most enjoyable evening.</p>
