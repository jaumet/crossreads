 Tuesday I have been up to the lines again today.  The Bosh put in a great number of shells this evening.  We stood &amp; watched them.  I am sure he put 200 in one spot, evidently after a battery.  There is a shrill whining sound as the shell comes over then an upheaval like a huge water spout flinging dust &amp; dirt &amp; mingling smoke &amp; shell with it for 30 feet in the air, then the deafening crash.  No doubt that will be put on to his score &amp; probably tonight he will get about 6 times as much in return.  Mills came in with his Batt. today. It has been raining today &amp; the place is a bit sloppy. 
 Wednesday May 23rd Our men have now gone up to the wood at Ploegsteert and are camping in the wood under low canvas shelters. Plugstreet wood has been the scene of heavy fighting in this war.  It is a beautiful tract of woodland, I suppose about a mile &amp; a half square &amp; just now looks very nice.
