  
 Thursday 11 July To-day some of the 1st Battn. found Fritz asleep & went out and collected eighty of them & brought them in with only one casualty.  They say it was done so quietly that the Germans in the rear are ignorant of the event, 4 p.m. 
 Friday 12 July Wet and windy all day.  Ye Gods the 1st & 4th Battns. are taking Bosches galore & the total is not about 150 and our casualties are very slight.  In fact there is very little fighting over the matter at all.
