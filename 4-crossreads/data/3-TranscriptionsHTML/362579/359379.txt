<p>pink bedsocks that Alice made. I did not wear them last winter   &amp;  they were in an old suit-case with some other things   &amp;  someone grabbed it out of my tent, so it turned up the next day.</p>

<p>Quite a number of the old Staff of 1st A. Gen Hosp. are here now. So it is quite a reunion.</p>
<p>Esther Hart   &amp;  I share a room it is great to be with old pals again. she came out on Kyarra with us   &amp;  we were very friendly in Egypt.</p>
