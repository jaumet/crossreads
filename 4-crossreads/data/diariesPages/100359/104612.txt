Last night the snipers were busy and got 2 of the 24th both in the head, One was killed outright. The other was very badly injured. We took him in to our D.S. about 3.30 this morning. It was pitch dark and the rain had made it heavy walking. The track is very bad in places and we had a torch with us which every time we flashed brought a shower of bullets around. There is one very bad open space of about 150 yds. Just as we started across a star shell lit up the bloomin? scenery and one could almost feel the hiss of the bullets as they went by. To make matters worse our patient kept trying to get off the stretcher. What with holdng him down, dodging shell holes, and expecting every minute to stop a bullet our trip was quite eventful. We heaved a deep sigh of relief when we reached our dugout in safety again. "Snowy" Atherton and his party took in the body, after breakfast.

 Fine Morning, Things quiet last night. Plenty of our aeroplanes about this morning. "Billsy" May "Snowy Atherton and I went into the A.D.S, for rations Church Service was on, so we adjourned to the Lawn where we had a very enjoyable few games of croquet. "Snowy" won 2 games, Billsy won the other after a very exciting finish. The Huns were putting over a lot of shells into Armentieres, and they shrieked right overhead as we were playing. We called in at No. 2 Post on our way back and had a yarn with Capt. Catford, who invited us to partake of a nip of rum, which we most certainly did as it was getting cold. Finished my epistle to M.M.
Monday 2nd
Things very quiet. Weather cold and wet and muddy. Got a shock this morning. Tom Mooney arrived back with our Rum issue. Stan Wright got a parcel, which was sent for his Birthday. It contained shortcake and various other good things, so with these and the rum we had quite a birthday celebration.
