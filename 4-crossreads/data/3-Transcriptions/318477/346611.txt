<p>20th March</p>
<p>Diary of my first trip from Australia to fight.</p>
<p>Sailed from Sydney 17th March in the S.S. Shorpshire [Shropshire] at 5 o'clock p.m., arrived at Melbourne Friday 2 o'clock p.m. 19th March.  We took 200 troops on board at 1.30 Saturday 20th March, nothing unusual occurred on that trip.  I did not get a chance to go ashore at Melbourne so I cannott tell you much about it Except that it takes the boat about 4 hrs. from the heads to port Melbourne, we laid out in the stream &amp; the transport boat carried the Melbourne boys on board.</p>
<p>March 21st<br/>We left Melbourne at 6.45 on 21st after a verry cold visit.  Rumours were numerous, some say that there was something wrong with the propeller but afterwards found out to be untrue.  At Melb. we took aboard 8 nurses, They being the only women folk aboard, we now have 18 Sgts. in our mess, previous to that we only had 12.  After leaving Port Melbourne we struck the heads 3 hrs. after leaving Port Melb.  I am told it is called the (Rip) it is a glorious sight, one mass of whirlpools &amp; verry rough, we lost sight of land about 8 p.m. 21st March on the way to Albany which I believe is our next Call.</p>
<p>22nd March<br/>There is no land in sight, we are now in the Great Australian Bight, it is beginning to get Rough some say that we will have a storm to night.  One poor unfortunate individual slipped on deck &amp; broke his arm so I was told off to get a party of 12 men to holy stone the decks.  We have only lost 1 horse since we started.</p>
