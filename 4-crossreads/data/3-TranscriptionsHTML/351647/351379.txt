<p>Mon Cher Amie,</p>
<p>Comment allez vous?  Il pleut, oui mais il fut un orage terrible but really I can't find thunder &amp; lightning in ma dictionaire, so won't continue in French.  It was about the toughest storm I've struck hereabouts but it has cooled &amp; cleared the air.  The last few days have been quite oppressive and of course yesterday I must get inoculated, a sweet experience.  Last night I felt like nothing on earth, couldn't sleep &amp; this morning wasn't much better but thank heaven I'm on the mend now &amp; hope to be my usual self by Sunday quand J'espere aller en Amiens.  It will be a bit of a change to see civilization again, have a decent bath &amp; two decent meals &amp; perhaps hear some music.  I shall I think go to High Mass at the Cathedral.</p>
<p>Il y a beaucoup demoisettes la, mais j'regardai seulement, je ne repondrai pas si ils parleraient a moi.  What.</p>
<p>Things are fair to medium here, we came down form the line about a week ago.  I was</p>
