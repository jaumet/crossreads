substitute for a Turkish bath.  It's marvellous the work that is done in those gallies.  There is only a very limited space to cook for the number we have on board, & yet they do it sufficiently well to avoid complaints from the men, & that is really an accomplishment to be proud of.  You may go into that galley any time during the day, & you'll see five or six men going hell for leather to have the next meal ready.  The next letter will probably be written ashore.  I forgot to mention before, that we are being so well looked after that I will be able to send down to my men, twelve pounds of pound cake & two tins of biscuits.  I am finishing this letter during a night watch, in the intervals between my rounds & so it is probably pretty disconnected.  I got everything that you sent aboard including a letter which has the power to cheer me up whenever I lapse into "That sweet mood when pleasant thoughts bring sad thoughts to the mind".  Probably I have misquoted, but still you know what I wish to express.  I must say goodbye now till next mail.
Your affectionate son,Arthur
