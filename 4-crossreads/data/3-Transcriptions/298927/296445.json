<p>The Lt has lost the balance of his senses and has become a military maniac &amp; was taken away to-day.</p>
<p>14th  Sep.  Got 56 hours leave to London.  Went on the Thames to Kew Gardens.  On Sunday there was an air raid scare, but nothing happened.<br/>We saw some of the damage done by the previous raids. One of the lions at Cleopatra's needle was badly mutilated.<br/>All damage is immediately repaired and a week later you would not think there had been a raid.</p>
