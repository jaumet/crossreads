  
 to Matupi Island. We started out at 6 o'clock and stop out for the day. We had plenty of swimming and sports in the afternoon with the niggers. We were throwing small coins in the water from a wharf and had a diving and jumping match. It was fun to see the little ones about 3 years old swimming in about 12 feet of water. Well about 5 o'clock we fell in and marched away home again and got back to the barrick about 6 o1 clock. We had low tea and sat on the log talking and thinking when we were leaving thus unearthly place but the time is passing for it won't belong. We start out on another march for 2 day. We went through the tunnel and then to the beach at the north of the Island. We stop there till 3 o'clock and march 4 more miles further and camp for the night. It was a beautiful march
