<p>I jumped out of the train and rushed to the barricade and in two secs kissed my dear old sister, we took a cab home and I learned that my father was terribly low but just living for me.  As we drew near the house I whistled and over the fence came dear old Tam, he knew me immediately and jumped all over me then my darling little mother looking splendid, oh how happy I was, they prepared me for Dad and I went into his room &ndash; my poor father &ndash; he is just alive, he is emaciated but happy to meet his son he could not speak save - I have lived for this my son.  I stayed with him all the afternoon he is so proud of me.  I am proud to think also that I returned to him with honours.<br/>A few hours home and I forgot I had ever been away &ndash; so now dear diary I have kept you all these long thirty months, we have seen much and suffered much.  You are my remembrance of all so now I am home again I will close up.</p>
