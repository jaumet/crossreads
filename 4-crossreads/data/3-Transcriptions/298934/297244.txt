<p>sleep again.  Marines going up the valley to the firing line all night to relieve us.  Next morning our bn. was relieved &amp; moving further down the valley nearer to the beach we dug in to enjoy some rest.  <strike>Sunday</strike> To-day Saturday had a wash in the sea.  Went along to where we landed &amp; was extremely lucky to find my pack still there.  We had been helping ourselves to each others packs.  Had my first shave for a week.  I had quite a nice long flowing beard.  Travers cut my hair with a pair of nail scissors.  Did some washing &amp; mending &amp; so now feel all sagani.  The Indian Mounted Battery all doing good work.</p>
