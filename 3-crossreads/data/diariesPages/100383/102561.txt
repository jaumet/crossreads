Railway Station where I caught the train but had to change at Salisbury & wait an hour or so during our wait we went & had tea & a look round the town. We managed to catch a fast train for London & alighted at Waterloo Station & then took tube for Leister Square where we had a look round & then proceed to Paddington by tube where I stayed for the night. Next morning I caught a fast train from Paddington Station at 10.30 & proceed to Birkenhead. Our journey lay through beautiful country & big towns & also through Wales & right through was a very fine trip. On arriving at our destination I reported to Civil Police & then went for a stroll. I soon learned that the H.M.A.S. Melbourne was in docks so I went & met a cobber who showed me all over her deck but although it was very interesting everything was disturbed as she is undergoing improvements etc. I left Birkenhead same night by 10.30 train with prisoner & escort but we were only in the train an hour when we had to get out at Chester & change trains. We did not have long to wait & then we had a little over an hours ride & then had to change at Crewe & wait some time. It was well into the early hours in the morning when we got a train which carried us
