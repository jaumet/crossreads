<p>21 April, 1916<br/>Salhia<br/>I went accross to the New Zealanders to have a kick with them at Football &ndash; Young Foster who is in their lot &amp; whom I knew on the tramway was over there, he was packing his kit bag &ndash; he &amp; I listened to the band for a while, then went for a walk. This morning we got orders to have out kit bags in by 4 oclock this afternoon.  We are to move off shortly &amp; by the talk we are to see a little active Service again.  We take our horses with us this time.</p>
