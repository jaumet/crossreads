<p>Ypres  8/10/16  Called at 3 am and turned out into the dark and took charge of headquarters while the C.O. went the rounds of the trenches.  Our patrols came on nothing in their adventurous travels and indeed, we think there is not much in front of us except for wandering policing patrols.  Greig compiled intelligence reports and despatched same with wind and situation reports.  The work in "B" Co was again not up to standard and Hunter took over from Elmiger who goes to "C".   Crowther left this morning.  At about 8.30 the enemy commenced shelling here with shrapnel but no casualties resulted.  Too much movement round about this morning.  The rest of the day was quiet and plans were matured and discussed for a raid.  In the evening King came down and this was gone into.  Bed 8.30 pm.</p>
<p>9/10/16  At 3 am carried on again.  A quiet morning but rather dark and cold.  At 8.30 our guns commenced a strafe on the Hun wire and provoking  little retaliation.  The day was a dull grey one and  the only aeroplane which came across had to fly very low.  The Huns shelled him heavily and he kept company backwards and forwards until his job was finished but always on a different tack and elevation.  The aircraft stuff is all black smoke shell as distinct from the white of Gallipoli and early days here.  The C.O. of the English battalion on our left dropped in.  He is a Capt. and has a battalion 60 strong! Monocled and very good sort.  Yarned for a while and had some whisky.  Other people concerned happened along later in the day and discussed details of raid. Bed 8 pm.</p>
<p>10/10/16  3 am commenced work on Intelligence reports.  At 8 our guns cut wire for 10 minutes but provoked no retaliation.  Things very quiet during the day.  Busy with details for our "jolly boys" but the General called in during evening and told us of postponement. Furpheys flying round and gradually materialising in the familiar fashion re our next visit to the Somme. Furpheys which are persistent are true often.</p>
