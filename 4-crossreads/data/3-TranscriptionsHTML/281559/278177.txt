<p>(about 1 &frac12; hours ride) &amp; it was a good pleasure trip : camps bay was very pretty : I notice plenty of Aust'n gum trees about &amp; they're used in many cases as border trees in the streets : had a stroll through the gardens : home about midnight</p>
<p>Tuesday June 3rd Capetown</p>
<p>Off to shore about 10 am : met Wal Muir &amp; had some time with him : had a swim in the morn but it was a bit too cold to be enjoyable : went through the Museum : out to Rhode's estate &amp; monument in afternoon : pleasant outing &amp; the monument is well worth a visit : it cost &amp;pound 80,000</p>
