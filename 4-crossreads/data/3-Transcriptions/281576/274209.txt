<p>Monday Apr. 30th  Commd Letter to M.S.  Beautiful sunshining day.  Plenty of planes about.  After Tea we had a rehearsal to prepare for our Show at the Y.M.C.A. Hut in Albert.  Staff Kitson returned from Blighty.  He says he had a glorious time &amp; that he failed to notice any Food Shortage in England.</p>
<p>Tues. May 1st   Typical May Day.  Nice warm &amp; sunny.  Our Show in Albert was almost a dud.  First of all the Gas Pipe Burst &amp; set fire to the stage; then half way through the 1st half the lights went out &amp; we had to use candles.  Eric Herford forgot his words in "Who killed Kaiser" &amp; I did the same.  Payney &amp; Bill May were in good form &amp; Bill Gamble was quite brilliant.  The 2nd Part went well &amp; the Sketch went screamingly .   The Y.M.C.A. people gave us a Good Supper after the Show.</p>
<p>Wed. May 2nd  Another glorious day.  Our Tug o' War Team pulled against the 15th to see who should pull in the Div. Sports on Friday  on Sat Bricky, Bill Williams &amp; I went into Albert after Tea.  It was quite a treat to be among civilians again.</p>
<p>Thurs. May 3    Finished my letter to M.S.  <br/>This morning our figures for the Con Camp were incorrect, so we spent the morning fixing them up.  After the 2 o'clock parade we got busy &amp; scrubbed our Hut out.</p>
