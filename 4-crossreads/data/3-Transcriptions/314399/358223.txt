<p>Thursday 14 August 1919<br/>Nice breeze today. Read most of the day, but gee I'm some unsettled. Can't be bothered reading for long. Must go for a walk somewhere. Was in for two sweeps  today &amp; won both. Brought in &pound;3.16.0. Not at all bad. Do me. Had a fancy dress ball tonight. Gee its some fun. Some of the costumes were good.</p>
<p>Friday 15 August 1919<br/>Quite cold today. The fancy dress people had their photos taken. Some of the costumes were rough. Particularly the colonels &amp; one or two diggers. Had pillow fighting today. Some of the fancy costumes had a try too. An officer had a good civvy suit pinched last night. This is the third lot. It appears a digger went into the cabin locked the door &amp; passed out the suit thro the port &amp; then got thro himself. All officers were inoculated against flu this afternoon</p>
