The Germans would then show the men that would not join, how their comrades were fed, and would promise them all a real good feed if they would only join up too. A lot turned just on purpose to get the food, & afterwards tried to get out of it, but were beaten & almost killed by the Huns. Later on when Sir Roger Casement was captured & put to death by England as a traitor to his country, the Brigade fell through but I do not know what became of the men that had joined up. Some of them will find themselves in a very tight place if ever they go to England again.
Afterwards the German Papers used to publish the Photograph of Sir Roger Casement as the "Great Irish Martyr & Patriot" who the English had unlawfully executed.
