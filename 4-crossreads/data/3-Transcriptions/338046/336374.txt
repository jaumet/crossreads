<p>verbatim from letters, as I thought that a description written at the time was less likely to err from the truth than one that my memory called up several years later.</p>
<p>The story does not attempt to be a history of the war, or a history of the 30th Battalion, but rather it delineates the impressions of a common or garden soldier during three years in the Army.   Some details may appear to be incorrect, but I can only say that the details as written were put down as they struck me at the time.</p>
<p>The title "Three years and a day" is taken from my Discharge Paper which places my Military service at that period.</p>
