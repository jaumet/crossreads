<p>Charley boys &amp; Ivan MacD. but they have all gone.  They had shows of getting to Batteries &amp; really it would have been criminal to have held them back.  I could get but the O.C. has been damned decent to me.  I like &amp; know him so I'll hang on for a little.  Maybe we'll both get off together some day soon.  I think I'll knock off.  You must forgive me if its dull but I feel dead dopey tonight &amp; its a pity.  I am very well &amp; if I weren't I'd be all right as I've made friends with the medical people here.  One chap is rather decent &amp; has the most gorgeous golden red hair &amp; is very musical.</p>
<p>Its a beautiful country really.  I don't know how long we are here for or where we will go to next.  I hope you get my letters.  I have received all yours up to 17 (11th June &amp; Mac's too).</p>
<p>Well I must go its too dark to see &amp; I'm turning in.  My love to the Boss &amp; Graham &amp; Mac &amp; all the people around.  I didn't know Mrs. Westmacott had left Australia.  She'd be glad.  I wonder if he would be.  Aren't they weird.  Bon soir.  Ma chere Madame.</p>
<p>Always yours as ever,<br/>Jim Wilkie</p>
