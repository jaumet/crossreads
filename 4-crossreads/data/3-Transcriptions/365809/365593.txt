<p>My dear Judge<br/>I am still fit. Am quartered in a very nice Belgian Billet very comfortable and owned by a very nice old Belgian "Madame"  The country is very pretty and very green but awfully wet and boggy. The C.O. went on leave last night I am temporarily commanding the show. The Bn is spread all over the country side and some of the officers are about 2 miles away from their men.</p>
<p>Had a dreadful row over some courts martial the other day. I am not quite sure whether I won or not. I don't think I shall be put on any more courts for a while anyway.</p>
<p>Everyone is talking at once and I find it difficult to write letters. Abroz is the worst offender. He sends his kindest regards to you. He also says that he intends to write to you soon<br/>Best Love<br/>Yours affectionately</p>
<p>CR Lucas.</p>
