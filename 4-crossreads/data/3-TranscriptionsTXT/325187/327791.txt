[Tuesday 15 February 1916]
I don't feel any older but another year has gone I hope to be with you all again ere another comes around.Did I explain that the Brigade is split into Regiments, & the Regiments into Squadrons each unit on its own, then the Squadrons are split again in to troops, & stationed out.  You will see by map where Samalut is on the railway.  We have a Canal nearby & it is Paradise to the Desert.  One feels like a spring heel jack walking on solid ground again after the Desert sand.An armoured train with search light patrols the railway just like Africa & we patrol the Caravan routes coming in from the Desert-600 Rifles so far have been collected
