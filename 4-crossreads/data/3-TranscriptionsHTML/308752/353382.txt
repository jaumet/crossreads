<p>Saturday 18th November 1916.<br/>A great scene this morning, the ground was covered with snow, it must be cruel in the front line in weather like this. A wet, miserable &amp; cold day. Very few patients so we spent the day sitting round a big fire &amp; talked about Sydney etc.</p>
<p>Sunday 19th November 1916.<br/>Raining in torrents all day, &amp; the mud was awful. Hundreds of patients arriving from the trenches. The poor chaps look terrible, one mass of mud from head to foot. 147 walking patients sent down by train to the rest station. I went with them (Ronnie McManus was one of the sick).</p>
<p>Monday 20th November 1916.<br/>Great organisation? waited over 24 hours for a train back. A big pile of blankets &amp; stretches to go back for the boys in the front line &amp; no means to convey them. In some cases the wounded man on a stretcher has been only one blanket over him, you can just imagine how cold it must be for the poor fellows when it takes hours to get them through the different relay posts to the train. Met Les. Hall from Cremorne, Tiny O'Brien &amp; Ern. Snashall.   At last at 7 p.m. the train actually arrived, reached our quarters at the Railway siding at 9 p.m. &amp; find all rush &amp; excitement as we are off to the trenches in the morning. Would rather be going the other way believe me!</p>
