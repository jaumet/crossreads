<p>Tincourt. Spell<br/>Weather very damp and close. Terry Smith and Percy Grayling promoted to Bdr. I was very pleased to hear the latter news.<br/>Bulgaria seems to be in a pitiful pickle  and "Jacko" is having a fairly warm time. Having a fairly busy time. <br/>Went to Don [indecipherable] for lamp and pliers &ndash; got both.<br/>Stunt to come off in the morning. We are going across with the second wave. I understand Reveille is to at 1 am tomorrow. Best of luck for the stunt. Tom Code and McCully to L'aison</p>
