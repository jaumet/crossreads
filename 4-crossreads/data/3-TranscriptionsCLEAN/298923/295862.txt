  
 15 July 1918 Monday Marched in on foot to Breakfast at 0600; lost a few men coming in from Shelling-  Our Camp is under direct observation from Turks guns-  German prisoners say Turks did not cooperate altho' "they" the Germans kept the Turks without much Water for 2 days to make them keen to attack & get it from our Wadi:  NICE! Busy collecting war material & burying dead.   I lost some of my best N.C.O.s   The German wounded suffered greatly from thirst but as the Red X is always fired on & shelled by them it is their own fault.   Shows how much a man knows in WAR-  I was wrong in thinking we had the "WIND UP" unnecessarily.
