My dear AuntyI received your letter also parcel (which was very welcome) last week, thanks very much for them. I was badly in need of socks when your parcel arrived, I had only one pair &amp; they were nearly worn out, so you see they were just the thing.
I was very sorry to hear that Charley was wounded, I did not hear anything about it till two days afterwards, when I was told he was killed, it was not till about a month later that I found out he was to return to Australia. Hope his arm gets alright soon.
We have had no fighting since the 9th Aug. but will probably have something to do before long
