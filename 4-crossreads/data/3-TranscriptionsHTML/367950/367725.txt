<p>positions back along the line. Now, all morning there has been 17 of our machines over the Turkish lines bombing hell out of them and this afternoon about 7 or 8 of our planes have been patrolling the blue Vault of Heaven for signs of Taubes. And right amongst them like a hawk among chickens is seen a Taube! Was there ever such brazen cheek? He did not drop bombs &ndash; probably hadn't time &ndash; and at least 4 or 5 of our planes at top flying speed after him.<br/>The Taube sailing away as gracefully as a bird and as usual leaving our machines hopelessly and helplessly in the rear. Talk about speed, it was the very limit. But he got away safe although Fritz played no monkey Tricks today inviting our fellow to "Come on". He was quite content to make leave a clear pair of heels behind him.<br/>Our planes have just come back buzzing like angry bees probably at their disappointment at not getting close. It would be interesting to catch a couple of those Taubes then Fritz would have to look out for squalls.</p>
