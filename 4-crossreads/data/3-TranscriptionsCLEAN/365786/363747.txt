so appalling that the first month we must send 32,500 after that 16,500 per mth.Ought I to send a man to his death.  Can our Australians can't win the war.Then Our men have done wonders.  Their bravery is unquestioned, their initiative & grim determination only equalled by the Empire's best soldiers & in this terrific war every little helps.  Our men at present are only holding a small portion of the whole front & should we fail to reinforce them, our volunteers this little bit of the line, Australia's proud position will be manned by other Britishers not Australians & our men will volunteers over at the Front will go as reinforcements to other Imperial regiments & the name Australian Imperial Force will only be a memory.
