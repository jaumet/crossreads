  
 March 1918 & give the mess committee the money.  I think we could do much better. 
 Friday 8th Was fairly busy all the morning getting out orders etc.  In the afternoon got a decent book & had a read.  The weather is very close & hot. 
 Saturday 9th Went to the Races at Heliopolis in the afternoon.  I picked the winners of the first 2 races & did fairly well up to the last race.  Had a good afternoons sport.  It wasn't a backers day as very few of the favourites did any good at all.  Saw Bob Thorne at the Races & he came into town with me,  He is at the cavalry school.  Saw Frank Grant of Bellingen after dinner in the street & had a yarn to him.  He is also at the School of Instruction. 
 Sunday 10th Half the staff got the morning off & many of them went to Alexandria.  I elected to work & will have next Sunday off.  An English mail was in this morning, but got nothing out of it.  Am expecting a parcel. Ella
