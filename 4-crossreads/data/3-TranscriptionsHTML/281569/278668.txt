<p>82 wks from home</p>

<p>Things exceptionally quiet today, pulled the old scrap down &amp; gave her a thorough clean out &amp; found her OK inside, she is standing up to the work splendidly.</p>
<p>Mail is expected in a day or two &amp; will come in jolly handy as news is very scarce.</p>
<p>Played cricket in the evening &amp; then chess  met train at 10.30 &amp; turned in at 11.30 tired out.</p>
<p>9 May, 1916 Tuesday</p>
<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>Nothing doing what-so-ever, horses &amp; men went out as usual to the palms, tents have changed hands &amp; we are now issued with a marquee. Mail from home last night &amp; the news of Frank Carter's death is confirmed, pretty bad luck for them &amp; it will go pretty hard with them in future to make both ends meet.</p>
<p>Went down the line a few miles in the direction of Girga to report on the condition of roads, telegraph lines etc, tyres &amp; tubes are giving heaps of trouble lately as the rubber is all mifish on account of the heat.</p>
<p>Played more cricket &amp; chess &amp; turned in at 10.30.</p>
