 12/12/17 Mt. Kemmell Two hundred men on fatigue and the balance doing drill and training. Spent all the morning rehearsing the raiding platoon. General Paton came along. In the trench they fixed up some very realistic dead Germans for the different parties to rat. Not a bad stunt after several tries at it. After lunch we played the A.S.C 5th. Div at football and beat them badly. A big squadron of Gothas came over on a bombing raid but did not touch us. An impressive sight. They killed and wounded a number in the 3rd Div battn we are relieving. Sutherland came back from there blood bespattered. They got in among a crowd playing football &amp; caused much consternation. The roar of guns have greatly increased on the sector the last few days. At 6 pm. H.Q. had their dinner and it proved to be extremely enjoyable.
