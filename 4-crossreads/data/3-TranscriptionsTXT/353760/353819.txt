 January 13, 14 95. A clear star night, air full of frost:  a lovely day from early till late &ndash; one of the best of the Hermies days of last March when the 1st Division were advancing before Cambrai. 
 Supper in the hut with Toby and others:  porridge &amp; cake from the Civil Service.  Vin Sellers singing in the Musick Room of our Villa Billet:  old songs of full and lovely melodies:  Basil B. at the piano. 
 A good day's ending to sleep on.  Finished the reading commenced yesterday of Ian Hay's "The Right Stuff", a pretty and a light amusing novel and well written. 
 Put in for Paris leave. 
 January 14 96. Deep snow and fine snow falling turning out this morning:  then a faint sun, and skies of faintest blue &ndash; merging to the colour of the gleaming snow. 
 Mail, T.L.S. and some good announcements:  a new book of W. W. Gibson's 'Whim', &amp; a new book of James Stephens "Reincarnation":  also two new books of Tagores.  Wrote to Beaumonts for "Whim". 
 Roland K. tells of his being engaged to an English girl.  Toby &amp; Bill from home hear of there being "memories"! 
 January 14 97. Letter to Beaumonts, Jan. 15 (dated), 
 Dear Sir Tonight a few readers of the ambulances have decided upon the forming of a miniature Book Club:  so &ndash; would you be so good as to act as our Bookman? 
 You will easily understand our position:  we are constantly on the move &ndash; sometimes a party established as an Aid Post in the lines &ndash; at the Advance Dressing St. &ndash; or behind the lines at the M.D.S.  So our books will be the cheap editions and pocket editions. 
 I am assuming you will act for us, so am enclosing a Postal Order of &pound;2 to be placed to our credit and a list of the first books asked for &ndash; to be forwarded under my name to the 1st Aust. F. Amb. 
 We would deeply appreciate too catalogues of S.H. Books, and inexpensive and pocket editions. 
 Thanking you I am sir Yours sincerely Frank H. Molony Act. Secretary 
 Never forwarded. 
 Tonight the meeting and little discussed:  selections made of Books, and my mentioning Beaumonts is the shop decided on.
