I hope the old chap comes through well.   Sutherland and I then rode to Heilly where I called in at Bde Hqs.   We then rode fast back to Franvillers .   The big guns had now commenced their evening bombardment and the skies were lit up by their vivid flashes.   The roads were crowded with all imaginable kinds of transport and the warm earth after its heavy soaking during the shower today was giving off the pleasantest of perfumes.   We rode back into Montigny about 11 and I sent King back into Franvillers  to be my liaiason officer and arranged a relay of mounted men to bring me news of the attack.   Also arranged for Braithwaite to find out the prisoner's cage and the ambulances there to get news of wounded etc.   For many good men must die within the next 24 hours and it is rather fascinating to speculate who is going to get killed &amp; who wounded.   About 26 officers are going into the attack and a proportion must inevitably become casualties.   Who are they going to be!   The next few hours will show.   Had some supper and then went to bed.
