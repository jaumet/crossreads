<p>&amp; Capt. Mackenzie is coming to C. so that is a very profitable swap.<br/>The ground is very wet and sloppy for it is thawing fast.<br/>They are paying In our hut today &amp; they are making a nice mess of it with the mud they are carrying in on their boots, it will resemble a pigsty <br/>shortly.<br/>14th  Went for a short route march this morning as far as "Peronne Avenue" &amp; came back &amp; started rifle drill, I never saw the men so dopey before  they were more like a lot of old women, &amp; worst of it I could not shake them up for I can hardly speak I'm that hoarse,  it makes me mad to look at a lot of men with no life or snap in their work</p>
