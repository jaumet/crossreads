<p>Autographs Torquay  17/8/16</p>
<p>Sometime when you think of the days that have gone<br/>In prosperity, even in failure,<br/>Though our friendship was short<br/>Still spare just a thought<br/>For the comrades from sunny Australia.</p>
<p>We're glad to know our English friends<br/>Extend the welcome hand<br/>And hope as time goes on they'll not<br/>forget Australia's band.</p>
<p>S Young<br/>17/8/16</p>
<p>Words may be false tears<br/>but unrecorded untruths<br/>but eyes are the windows of the soul</p>
