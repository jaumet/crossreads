 1st Anzac Mobile workshops near Reninghelst [Reningelst]. As our 4th Divisional Artillery Is coming out of line, the workshops were filled with ordnance. I secured several fine illustrative plates. The workshops can deal with practically every detailof ordnance but barrel work. Returned to Steenvoorde 3 pm. The weather being impossible for photographic purposes any further. 
 3rd Novr /17 To Ypres and completed flashllghting in the cellars. Weather bad. 4th Novr. Great artillery activity during the early morning  sounding like the beating of innumerable drums. On account of the bad foggy weather remained in camp all day. This is the first real day off we have had since coming over here.
