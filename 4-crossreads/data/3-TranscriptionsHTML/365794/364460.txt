<p>Wednesday 28 February 1917 [27 February 1918]<br/>Mrs. Devonshire's lecture 6 p.m.  She is not interesting to listen to though knows her subject well.<br/>Afterwards a whist drive at Aust. Club.<br/>Very late back &amp; found letters from T'mba waiting.  All well but business quiet I gather.</p>
