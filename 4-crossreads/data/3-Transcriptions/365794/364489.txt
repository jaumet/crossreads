<p>Thursday 29 March 1917 [28 March 1918]<br/>1/2  day and met F. Blundell.  2.45 p.m. went Helouan by train, drove to tea gardens then walked by the Nile &amp; watched the sunset, very grand, then walked (a mile &amp; a half) back to Helouan with the full moon rising over the desert &amp; shining down upon us as we talked of many things.  Talk of self knowledge, one touch of an arm &amp; my long quiet is gone &amp; fear, not of anyone but myself comes.  I who am always so sure of things and of one's control of sensations seem to be just ordinary woman after all.<br/>Coffee at Sault's 8.45 a.m., [p.m.] then back to 27th after a very enjoyable but also very astonishing afternoon.  It is time I think that we had more nursing to do else love might take hold of even "me" &amp; that is not to be thought of.</p>
