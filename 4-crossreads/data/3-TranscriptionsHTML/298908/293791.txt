<p>10th.  A batch of 60 odd men left No. 10 Camp this morning for Devonport, that's the first batch from round this part of the world.<br/>Went down to the pictures at Sutton Veney this evening time hangs heavily on our hands here, &amp; a fellow has to do something I reckon this is the sort of place where they should start this educational scheme that the Army has been promised it would be a regular Godsend to a lot of men.<br/>Have had another trip to the dentists this afternoon &amp; I'm hanged if he didn't pull out the fillings of one of my front teeth.  This makes the 3rd time this has been done in this Camp, each dentist that I go to has a cut at it.</p>
<p>11th.  A few more men were sent from here today on Aussie leave I wish my turn would come quickly.<br/>Got a few letters from home &amp; etc. this afternoon most of them dated August or thereabouts.</p>
