 Tomorrow I have 2 days off &amp; am going to Cairo- how glad I am to have this opportunity before leaving Egypt. 
 October 2nd 1915- I have had two of the happiest days since leaving Australia.  On the 28th caught the 9 a m train from Alexandria to Cairo.  The journey for the 1st time to a newcomer is full of interest.  Everything is beautifully green.  You can see miles &amp; miles of corn in its various stages of growth  blowing  waving in the gentle wind all the way.  Pass some Arab villages c small houses constructed of earth of the most perculiar shapes.  We also pass a few large towns &amp; then as we near Cairo we pass twice over the Nile &amp; catch glimpses of the minarets of the numerous Mosques of the Capital (in all 356) and at 12.15 I arrive there.  I go to Rossmore House, book a room &amp; have lunch &amp; who above all should be sitting at the next table but 3 Adelaide folk- Mr Mrs &amp; Miss Mayo- Twas nice to meet them if only for a short time.  They have been here a fortnight &amp; leave tomorrow for Australia. Now there is such a lot I want to do &amp; see but foremost comes old friends, so set off by car to the Palace Hotel Heliopolis to see my old chum B Campbell, but found she had sailed for England last week.
