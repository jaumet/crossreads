<p>Friday 21 September 1917<br/>The same quiet rounds:  the cold could be left behind.  As we are leaving our native land and sailing westwards it would be a comfort, but showery cold days and no congenial companionship make the time drag somewhat.  Our sisters now branch out in their true colors, some are on intimate terms with the stewards, some race round the ship like wild horses too long shut in a paddock, others sew, gossip, knit, etc.<br/>My daily round &ndash; bath 6.30 a.m., walk on deck, breakfast 8.30 a.m., make bed, etc., read, 11 a.m. tea minus milk, knit, lunch 1 p.m., 4 p.m. tea, dinner 6 p.m.  Patience is the usual safety valve.</p>
