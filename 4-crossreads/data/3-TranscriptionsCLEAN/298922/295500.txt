Our new Commander in Chief is chief topic of conversation. Tommy officers say - "Really rough sort of fellah" - you men should get on well with him!!  After we got home from last STUNT I asked Troop Leaders to give me a List of any deficiencies caused through crossing Barrage of Shell Fire, meaning such equipment as NOSEBAGS, SHOE CASES etc. likely to fall off saddle - one put in4 pairs of PANTS!!!1 pair of BOOTS!!!
Going Port Said tomorrow on continued business & pleasure for 3 days so will post this with some snap shots. My Table manners will be lacking I'm afraid & I'll find the BED too soft.
