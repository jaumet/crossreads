After the service we had our Christmas dinner which consisted of soup, roast pork with apple sauce and harircot beans and potatoes and plum duff.

I only saw one decent bit of horse-flesh and that was a trotting thoroughbred.  The trams are very curious things with a big awkward scoop in front made of a rope net on an iron framework, to act as cowcatcher.
