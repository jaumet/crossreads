nothing out of the way. The Q.M. came up with the rations. About 10 pm a heavy strafe began and much stuff from both sides was whirring overhead. At our village baths we managed to bathe two companies and to give them fresh clean clothing. I sat up and sent all the others to bed having in my mind to go out and inspect our wiring party. As the light was bad they did not go out on the job until well after midnight. The men have put in a tremendous amount of work on their trenches making new bivouacs. The mistake of building the shelters in the trench will not recur. They now cut an L or I head back from the firetrench to a depth of 5 feet and then cover the top with iron or board and wood. These little shell slits are comparatively safe and the men make themselves very cosy there. The two Coy H.Q's that our men have put in under the supervision of the Engineers are quite good and ought to stop a 5.9. The occasional dud or the use of delayed action fuses puts the acid on fine reckoning though. The country is very lovely now and blossoms are showing on the fruit trees. Deep dark green and dark grey skies are the predominant colours. There is regular mist and some rain but the air is warm and you can almost hear things growing. The presence and of shells and responsibility put one off admiring the scenery. To wander round quietly in plain clothes in Springtime in times of peace and to walk this lovely land must indeed be beautiful.
