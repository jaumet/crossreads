  
 27th March  Transferred to the 15th Bgde Field Artillery. Camped at the historic place of Tel-el-Kirbir, was here that - made his stand against the Arabs. Tel-el-Kebir is some 150 miles from Cairo. Here we are to undergo some solid training before being sent to France, & are part of the 5th division. 
 April 3rd. Left Tel-el-Kirbir today for "Ferry's Post" on the Canal to finish our training & equipment. 
 Nothing of note worth recording just the same old routine of camp life till early in June when rumours of our early departure to France begin to float around. Was just at that time we received word of K. of K. death & on the 13th June a memorial
