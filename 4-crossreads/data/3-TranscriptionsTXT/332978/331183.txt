 [Transcriber's notes: Bapaume spelt Bapume Freiburg spelt Frieburg Heligoland spelt Heliogoland Karlsruhe sometimes spelt Karlshrue Passchendaele spelt Paschendale Riencourt spelt Reincourt Strohen Holzminden spelt Strohen Holtzminden Wells occasionally uses the (almost) German words "Gefangener", "Kriegsgefangener" or "Krieggefangenier", meaning "prisoner of war". "Robinson and Berline" are mentioned several times, with Berline occasionally spelt Baerline; there is no "Berline" listed on the AWM WW1 Nominal Roll, but Leickler/Leckler is mentioned frequently &ndash; not found in AWM WW1 Nominal Roll. Neame is mentioned several times; the only Neame in the AWM WW1 Nominal Roll is listed as "died of wounds" on 1 October 1917 &amp; is buried at Ypres. Of course these may well not have been Australians.]
