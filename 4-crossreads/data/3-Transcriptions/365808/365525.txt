<p>Dear Judge Ferguson,<br/>I have this morning a reply from Lindsay with regard to the Bear cartoon. I cannot do better than quote his own words, "Would you let Judge Ferguson know that he can have the Bear page for &pound; 5 [indecipherable].<br/>He is such an amiable man, that I would not like to charge more"<br/>With best regards<br/>Sincerely yours<br/><u> [M?] Macleod</u></p>
