near done there were scores more the same way, but the worst part was yet to come, that was when we were going up the "communication trench" to the firing line, for the trench was that narrow at intervals of a yard there were wooden uprights to hold the sides in place on these uprights our packs used to catch, talk about pull, struggle, swear well you should have heard us I think this sort of thing is about the most aggravating thing we have to put up with no one likes the idea of shifting about with packs up in the trenches, well at last we arrived at our posts, proceeded to take over from the 6th.
