<p>Provision to be made for men returning from the war.<br/>I know the C/W Govrnt are looking after this matter. We have been given cards to fill in, concerning it.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am wide of the mark for I have had no experience in these things. Also I am looking at things only from this end &amp; know little of affairs in Australia.</p>
<p>You told me Mrs. Dunlop that you sent me a parcel at Xmas &amp; enquired by if I received it. Many thanks for your kindness but I am also including the thanks of the chap who probably received it. Never mind, depend on it, a "soldier somewhere" received it &amp; rejoiced. I will send you a Turkish Cartridge by the next mail.<br/>Excuse all the scratchings &amp; mistakes. I know it is bad form attacking the remarks but I feel I must excuse myself this time. Going at full speed, to catch the mail in the morning.  Best wishes to you both.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br/>Clem Walsh.</p>
