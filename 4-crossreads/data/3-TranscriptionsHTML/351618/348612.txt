<p>Monday 30th August<br/>It is nice &amp; cool early this morning. I got a few more letters &amp; Papers which had been amongst the bags on the sunken barge. Went to Ordnance to get Bags Boots &amp; Tunics etc. Saw Olly Gunderson.</p>
<p>Tuesday 31st August<br/>There is a tinge of Winter in the air &amp; it is lovely after the hot days. Our chaps are commencing to cover themselves up a little more. There is not that absence of clothing on their backs that I spoke of some time ago.</p>
<p>Wednesday 1st September 1915<br/>There was a decided change last night &amp; I felt the chill of the air as I had to unceremoniously leave my bed for the rear. It was about midnight at the time &amp; I had five others to keep me company when I arrived</p>
