had orders to get what sleep we could. We were alongside old much knocked about trenches knew not our whereabouts, front or anything else. About one hour later wakened with great fear, fierce bombardment on all sides, guns of all sizes, as light as day almost by the flash of the guns. I was absolutely afraid to move curled myself up under great coat tried to stop trembling from cold fear as they must have warned us if in any danger. Prisoners passed through gully later.
25th. Tuesday.
