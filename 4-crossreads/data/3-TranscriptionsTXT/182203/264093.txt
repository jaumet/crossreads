to bring back with us. Had a Miss Nicholson to show & guide us around, an awfully charming woman, who has lived there all her life - her father was one of the Governors. - she gives all her time to give the Colonial men, officers & sisters a good time & show them around Windsor so we were very lucky.Wednesday, went into London early, saw Miss Conyers, enquired after my friends    &  relations fighting but could not get any news of them.Then we had lunch afterwards - went to Constitution Hill, to Queen Victoria Monument in front of Buckingham Palace. It is a wonderful monument & adds very much to the beauty of the Palace, in fact it makes the Palace.It was a perfect afternoon & the Park looked beautiful, went to Hyde Park but not through, because we were on our way to St. Paul's. Well, so far St Paul's is the most cheerful & bright Cathedral I have seen in England. The Statues are very grand
