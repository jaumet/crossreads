<p>8.4.16 Saturday<br/>Feeling much better &amp; have lost the violent Headache &amp; feverishness.  I went on Parade this morning &amp; carried out my usual duties.<br/>I have to attend a Court Martial in a day or so as prosecutor &amp; witness on 2 men who rioted in the Camp a day or so past.  It is a duty which I do not like but unfortunately I cannot get out of it.<br/>I got a Canvass Sleeping Bag from one of the Drivers to-day &amp; it will be just the thing when we are forced to camp under the wagons.<br/>I got a full report of our Divisions march across the Desert from one of our fellows who has come up from there.<br/>Of the suffering &amp; agony they put up with few can realise it to its full extent.  They were marching from S. Tel-el-Kebir to Serapeum a distance of 39 miles &amp; had it mapped out for a 3 days march.  15 miles 1st day, 9 &ndash; 2nd &amp; 15 the third.<br/>At the beginning of the 3rd days march they were Strung out all over the place &amp; nothing could move them from the torpor which they all seemed to be in.  Their water had given out the previous night</p>
