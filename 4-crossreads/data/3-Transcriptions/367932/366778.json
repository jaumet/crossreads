<p>Copy of letter Lionel Bigg</p>
<p>16 December 1915</p>
<p>The last letter from Anzac.</p>
<p>My dear Mother &amp; Father</p>
<p>How do you like the look of that top piece?  Yes we are going &ndash; I have hoped against hope for the last 3 weeks that it could not be &ndash; but now no one with two eyes in his head can think otherwise.  Almost everything is gone, just a thin line holding the trenches.  If they come now, well we may hold them, but we are weak; if they let us alone till tomorrow night we ought to do it.</p>
<p>If it wasn't so serious, it would make you laugh, and yet it nearly makes you cry &ndash; to think that we &ndash; after all the bluster and talk about getting to Constantinople, &amp; the Australian driving the broken down turkey with a bayonet &ndash; are running away like a whipped dog &ndash; Its scandalous, someone wants their bumps read for the whole show &ndash; We just take it; as a matter of course, no good doing anything else, but its hard Day after day we have sat here, hearing the troops going away</p>
<p>[Edward Lionel Bigg, (No. 512) No 1 Light Horse Reg.; enlisted August 29 1914.  He served in Gallipoli and was wounded in action at the Dardanelles.  In 1915 he was promoted to Corporal and later to Lieutenant.  He returned to Australia in November 1918.]</p>
