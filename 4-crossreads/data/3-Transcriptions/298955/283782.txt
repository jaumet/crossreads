<p>23 &ndash; E deM<br/>&pound;25,000 a year. There are acres &amp; acres of ground also a small village belonging to the estate. They treated me very kindly indeed &amp; wanted me to stay with them but of course I could not as I was due back on the following Monday. Aunt Florence not liking town life decided on buying an old fashioned Cottage where she &amp; Uncle could live after he had retired from his practice. After some little time she hit upon her ideal &amp; bought a very old place about 500 years old ten miles out of Brighton but to her great disappointment Uncle would not live there, it being too quiet for him. She has it furnished to her liking more China &amp; pictures a delightful little house within close vicinity. She has bought another house which contains her other hobby in the shape of 20 adopted kiddies all girls with the exception of two or three little boys. They are the prettiest kiddies I have seen all happy and very bright there is one little Indian girl about 5 black as can be with large black eyes such a funny little thing. They all call Aunt Florence Aunt &amp; very fond of her.</p>
