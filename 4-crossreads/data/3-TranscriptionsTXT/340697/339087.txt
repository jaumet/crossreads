We embarked on the Huntscreen today. The 1st and 2nd Bns Bde. H.Q. and a New Zealand regiment are on board here. We expect to go to Alexandria. The Huntscreen is well armed against submarines. She has about a dozen machine guns as well as one 12 lb. naval gun bristling from her decks. She is the captured German prize ship Derfflinger 24.12.15
Left Mudros bay for destination unknown on Xmas morning. Our Xmas ration for the whole day is 1 tin of bully
