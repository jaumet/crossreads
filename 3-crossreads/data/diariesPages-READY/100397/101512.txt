For a long time now, the men at Wareham have been very discontented, and there have been growing signs of an open mutiny, the heads, did not seem to care whether there was trouble or not, untill it came, then from what we can hear, things were lively and a considerable amount of damage was done. "I believe that the Military police raided a "Two up" school. and one of the players was knocked down and Injured by one of the horses. the mob then went mad, and raided the Police headquarters went everywhere looking for M.P.s raided one of the Canteens, then a lot of them boarded a train and went to Poole to smash the police force there, for sometime to come an M.P. will not be safe unless armed. Officers and men were sent from this camp to help quiet the mob. but how things are now we have not heard yet. I would not be surprised if trouble breaks out in this Depot ere long the ration shortage is likely to cause trouble as well as the fact that no leave is granted from this camp.
