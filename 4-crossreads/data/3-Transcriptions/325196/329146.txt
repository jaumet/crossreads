<p>18-3-16<br/>Sat 18th<br/>This morning there was a crowd of natives with donkeys, goats,  sheep, fowls etc waiting to cross the river on the punt when we were going out this morning apparently making into a small village close by us to a fare;</p>
<p>Had tea again with out friend Abdul Hamid when going onto the desert this morning &amp; promised to call again this afternoon, but as we went a couple of miles towards Tuk-El-Khul at dinner time in hopes of getting on higher ground (without success) we came into the village a different way &amp; did not call on him; It was windy today &amp; very unpleasant on the desert with the fine sand blowing all over us; I am trying to raise the energy necessary to learn Arabic; Fleas are very troublesome here</p>
