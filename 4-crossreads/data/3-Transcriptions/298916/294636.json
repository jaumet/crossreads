<p>It was annoying to say the least of it &amp; Captain Jackson remarked rather strongly on the "----- Australian methods". The procedure when about to transmit a message by wireless is as follows. The officer in charge (on H.M.A.S. Melbourne) issues the orders for the day which are usually transmitted <u>in code</u> by wireless to the Flagship. Here they are de-coded &amp; transmitted on the low powered set to the transports. Before being transmitted to the transports, the Flagship hoists a certain flag signal ten minutes previous to transmitting. This signal serves as a warning. The transports now hoist the same flag signal <u>at half mast</u>. Ten minutes after being hoisted on the flagship, the message is transmitted by radio (usual term for wireless). If transport receives the message OK, then the flag signal is <u>hoisted to the full</u>, but not unless the message is received OK. Until the message is received the flag signal must be left at <u>the half</u> when if necessary it will be transmitted again. Usually it was never repeated &amp; if missed, that ended it. The messages were many &amp; of little importance. Private so &amp; so. Number so &amp; so etc etc. Left wife &amp; children without support etc. Tug boat will</p>
