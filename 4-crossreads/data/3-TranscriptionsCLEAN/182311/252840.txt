    I've just been sitting in Frank Fairweather's billet, he has quite as good a fire as we have and the mess waiters brought up a cup of coffee and some gingernuts, (you know how much I like gingernuts) we talked of this and that and then decided to finish our letters and go to bed. 
    With best wishes, 
       from 
          HAROLD.
