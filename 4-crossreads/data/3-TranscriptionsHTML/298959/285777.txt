They are all numbered on the bow, and appear to be of the latest class. We could see 85, 56, 48, 62, and 27.<br/>Wednesday, 18th. Dull foggy day with rough sea. All our boats that had been lowered to the level of the decks on leaving Sierra Leone, were now swung loose, and ropes lowered over the side, every foot, with a Jacob's Ladder every three or four feet.
