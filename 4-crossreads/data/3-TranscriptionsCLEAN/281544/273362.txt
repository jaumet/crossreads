  
 Monday 12th was very low as it was very foggy, & it was hard to see them, when I got line clear I came away to Reigersberg Nth & put my two trucks into a Siding & picked up my Troop Train & when it was loaded away I went at 7.15am up to St Jean & put some Men out & further along I went & put out some more, when the alarm again was sounded & up in the Air I could see 5 Taubes hovering about. I did not move my train as it is harder to hit a Standing Train, Men were running for shelter & along the main Road a number of Motor Transports halted, I could hear Bombs exploding away in the Fog. The Taubes soon were hunted away by our Machines & I then proceeded up to Wieltje  Sidi  Station & detrained the balance of the troops & then came back to St Jean Yard & was releived at 8.15 am & walked back to our Vans & had breakfast & turned in, as I was very tired, being up since 7 am the previous day.
