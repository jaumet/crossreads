Christmas Day
Darling Mither,
Heartily wishing you a Happy New Year and also all at Home.
The first fall of snow was last night and today the countryside around looks typically Christmas-like in this part of the world.  But the weather has been very mild indeed and today is Good O.
I received some letters a few days back which I will reply to tomorrow.  We've had a rough time with the late arrivals of the trains, and we are a day behind even now.
Fondest love
James xxxxxx
