On the road to El Arish you get bully in your dishAnd you'll eat it if you want a ponzer thirstAnd the flies they make you cry, but you kid your self its Pie,Though you own you'd even rather eat some German Wurst.And you have to guess a range for yer peepers need change,And you wonder if Jock Burk is one or twoIts "Shove it up from four to six'  Raise your head & see his "[indecipherable]"And yer cobber says "You've got him in the shoe"
On the road to El Arish where the water stinks like fishThe Padre says three Joes have been before,There was Joseph & his brother & later on two othersBut those Joes were out for peace & not for warJoe Burk's a different brand, he don't feed out yer 'andAnd he lurks behind a sand hill for a "pot"If you get him in a Hod you may send him home to GodThat supposing you've the luck to get him first shot
On the road to El Arish, wear Joe's bullets going "Swich"Through the date palms on the hod where your'e at restBut we've taught him what he's learnt & he got his fingers burntApullin German Chestnuts comin WestAnd he's calling out "Ma leish" on the road to El ArishAnd the White flags always ready in his handOh he's crossing the Canal but he isnt going to yellFor the Boob is very quiet compared with sound
[Maleesh = Arabic, never mind]We were the Honey Honey SuckleJoe Burk was the bee.He tried to sip the honeyFrom our Camp at RomaniWe've got him "beaten and retreaten"To his base of courseWe gained a victory for the goodAustralian Light Horse
[Burk - Rhyming slang for Turk]
