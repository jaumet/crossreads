<p>only hope they will give me a chance of making a name for myself, for I am confident that once I got my foot on the "Aviation Ladder", (that is "to becoming a Pilot) I would go up.<br/>I thought a short time ago we were off to Ireland.  They issued us all with rifles &amp; 200 rounds of .303's, &amp; our MT service were "standing to" all one night, but nothing came of it.  The following day we fitted up with bombs &amp; mach. guns) &amp; dispatched 4 R.E 8's.  (a specially constructed type of fighting aeroplane) to Ireland   Later on in the same day we were informed by wire that the whole 4 had come croppers.  They had run into a violent storm on their way over, with the result that 1 fell into the Irish Channel, 2 landed on the Welsh coast, &amp; the 4th was smashed when attempting a forced landing.  All the pilots luckily escaped serious injury.<br/>Snow is still coming down ever so gently &amp; ever so softly, &amp; by morning it will be fairly thick.<br/>Must close now, people dear, hoping this finds you all well, &amp; not absolutely roasting while we over here are shivering,<br/>With fond love to you all &amp; every one.<br/>Ever your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
