  
 "Coppabella The Second" (My Dug-Out) "971" Gallipoli. 
 Nov. 26th 
 Dear old Mick, 
 A big batch of your letters just to hand, bearing various dates, from April 16th to October 3rd!  A typical instance of the erratic delivery of our mail.  Thanks very much [?] for those photographs - the little snapshots brought back vivid recollections of "Coppabella" and its dear inmates.  I don't know how it seems to you, but it seems years since I left Sydney.  I am afraid it is going to be a very long way to Tipperary, even from now.  So we must all sit down on our bottoms and wait patiently for this colossal struggle to end.  I don't think Gallipoli will bring about (or even help to bring about) any permanent victory, even if the War lasts ten years. 
 I have sent a few Xmas cards away -some of my own manufacture, but doubt if they will reach their destination.  I ordered some from England, but if they have not been torpedoed, they have been delayed so they are, in a musketry term - a wash-out. 
 Have not got the latest copy of Hermes yet, but it may turn up later.  Thank Enid Chandler for me 
 [Continuation of letter in margin] will you?  Got a couple of letters from some of the lower school chaps, but none from Alf, Heath or Hilton Chenball.  Will write and answer them when I get time.  By this mail in accordance with his wish, I have written a long letter to Dad.  I will write to Mum next week, tell her.  Got Dad's photos all right, they were bonza.  Glad you've got in touch with Rene Struck.  Ask her to write & send me her photo - it's such a deal of a time since I've seen her.  Don't forget to send me copies of the Senior & Leaving Certificates, as I will want to know what papers you got all your good passes in.  Have given Dad all 
 [Continuation of letter from top of page] the news.  Best love to all.  So long till next week. 
 Ever your affectionate Eric.
