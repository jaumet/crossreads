<p>25-11-1916<br/>Wet day, a few shells over during the night.  Mud something cruel.  Things very quiet.  Scarcely a gun firing.</p>
<p>26-11-1916, Sunday<br/>Raining all night and half the day.  Tonight at 8 oclock, ice was on the water, and by 9 oclock, was a white frost.  The big guns are bombarding.  A lot of our men getting sick and going to hospital.  A number of Indian troops here.  Infantry going to trenches.</p>
<p>27-11-1916<br/>Very foggy.  Shoeing smiths Hooper and Heyden injured.  The first named hit with a piece off of the heel of a shoe, Heyden torn with a horse nail, both out of action.  Hun aeroplanes busy.  One of ours coming down in flames.  The best piece of work I ever saw.  The pilot had complete controle from start to finish.  He actually picked a place to land.  It was an exciting few minutes.  A few coal boxes about tonight.  Some men blown to pieces on the road.</p>
