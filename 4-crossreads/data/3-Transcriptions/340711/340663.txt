<p>November.<br/>Saturday, 18.<br/>It is snowing. I have just woken up---six am. Fine powdery flakes they are. My first sight of snow on such a scale.</p>
<p>Monday, 20.<br/>Up all day. Nerve attack 7.pm and another at 1.30am.</p>
<p>Sister H. was a dear during the night. She didn't worry me---I was feeling pretty rotten and couldn't get any sleep, but she very quietly seemed to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 21.<br/>Had to take things pretty quietly all day. Couldn't lie other than prostrate all day.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 22.<br/>C. and Mrs. T. came out to see me. C. is on furlough. Went to concert in evening but couldn't "stick it" was bad so they told me next morning. All I know is I felt rotten when I got back to the ward.</p>
<p>Thursday, 23.<br/>(Transferred to Hope Ward). Woke up or rather came out of stupor feeling stupid. Received word that I was to go to Hope Ward. Try to get into spinal chair (I was very weak) but slipped and wrenched my back. Couldn't get out of chair and they hadn't sense to lift me. Nurse M.G. dragged me by legs to pull me lower down the chair again! I couldn't sit up at all.</p>
<p>Friday, 24.<br/>No good in morning but able to lie up a little in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Saturday, 25.<br/>Feeling a bit better and able to sit up a little in afternoon.</p>
<p>Sunday, 26.<br/>Visiting day. Misses F. and H. came and brought cake and Autograph Albums.</p>
