<p>TUESDAY, JULY 29, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine. Went over early and down to</p>
<p>the O.S.S Co&#39;s wharf at Circular Quay</p>
<p>The Sonoma berthed about 10 oclock</p>
<p>and Alan got off soon after. We</p>
<p>all went to the Wentworth. Linda</p>
<p>came in to Lunch &amp; all the Allisons.</p>
<p>Linda &amp; I got home after. We came</p>
<p>in to dinner at Usher&#39;s and went</p>
<p>on to Harry Lauder. It was not</p>
<p>much of a show.</p>
