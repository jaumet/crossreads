<p>Wednesday 24th<br/>We have a lovely mess, and are travelling 2nd class, food is perfect, pleasant day.  Had more time to-day.  W.O. relieved me of my twenty dressings.  After I have been with two Drs. I have to dispense and then make out reqns. &amp; diet sheets.  However am gradually getting things settled but my ankles ache with the running about on the hard deck after the desert.</p>
<p>Thursday 25th<br/>Passed Aden during night fell foul of Ship's Capt. to-day, Maleish.  Sisters help me a bit now by taking my worst patients into their hosp.  Iodine, mans eyes in place.  10&percnt;  Argyol xxx</p>
<p>Friday 26th<br/>I have most of my bad patients moved to the sisters ward now.  Things going much better I feed my light diets on Jellies &amp; Custards now.  Made great time all day.  Had hour to myself in p.m.</p>
<p>Saturday 27th<br/>Although hot we are having ideal weather and after a stuffy day in the wards one feels the benefit of a blow on decks when the night duty relieves us.  To-night we had an indifferent sort of concert,  I was recalled three times Desert stuff appeals to men present.  We have every convenience of saloon travelling and I almost think myself a civilian again.</p>
