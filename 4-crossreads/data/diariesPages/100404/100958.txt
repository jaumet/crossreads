Tuesday 9th May More bombs dropped on Port Said by force of Turks said to be approaching the canal. Two more AMC Details were sent to me to-day, I am now entitled to four. Smallpox patient dead, we finished vaccinating regs to-day.
Wednesday 10th May Early in morning we received the news that there was a big scrap going on at the Canal and we could hear the guns plainly. Then the news came that two squadrons of the 12th and two of the 11th are to be prepared to move off immediately, one squadron remaining behind to look after the horses There is a definite promise that they will follow us on but in the meantime we must go as Infantry. The news was startling to each man, and not popular but we will all be glad to get into action.
12th May 1916 I now close my diary down for the second time and with a regret for I start on a new book that seems strange to me, whilst you my old friend have faithfully chronicled the daily events of my active service career. I often wondered if I would ever finish you but my good luck has stuck to me so hoping your successor also reaches your destination safely.
I wish you good luck on the voyage.
