<p>July, 1915<br/>Wednesday 28<br/>Tell Mother I'm really off on Sunday next &ndash; so if I have any luck I'll be in the advance. Staying behind as <strike>Adjutant</strike> I might have got promotion quicker, but it is not altogether what I came over for. Poor old Colonel has to wait again for another draft it cuts him up staying behind - <strike>He is typical Irishman &amp; we get on well together, but have Sundry small rows of course &ndash; even at War men do not change &amp; in the trenches sometimes have a fight with pots among themselves.</strike></p>
