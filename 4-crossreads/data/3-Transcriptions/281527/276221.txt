<p>At 3.45 a.m. was awakened by a heavy bombardment all the big guns just in rear of this hill having opened up solidly. The dull rattle and rumble of the 18 pounders could be heard like an undercurrent. The Hun put over some gas and our gas sentry used his rattle to alarm people. Received a message after breakfast to the effect that the Hun had launched his offensive between St Quentin &amp; Cambrai this morning but that, as yet, no particulars regarding it are to hand. On this sector there seems to be much more heavy stuff flying round than usual. The Catacombs where three of the Coys. are is about half a mile from here. At this spot we have H.Q. and 1 Coy</p>
