<p>Tonight got back from Orderly room application for 1st Field:  Col."s approved of transfer if we can get "two men of good character" to exchange with:  will forward the paper to O.C. 1st and see what that will bring forth.  Those chaps who have lately come into the unit from the 1st all say there are plenty of their men who are ready for the exchange.  Though it may be that when it came to the point of leaving their original unit they"d back out.</p>
<p>246<br/>Lena Ashwell Concert Party at Y.M.C.A. tonight. What we had time to see was topping and the singing, best I"ve heard for months.</p>
<p>247<br/>Today 12 months ago said good bye to Mother behind the Pres. Tent at Liverpool.  They &ndash; Mother, Betty and Father in the car motored up and wanted me to come home for the night, but only went in the car as far as the Pres. tent where said good bye a year today:  it doesn"t seem six months and it seems six years.  I wonder how many of us that came away in the old Port Lincoln we"ll see go back.  If we were to rake together B.2 mess here for dinner, as they"d talked about (Jake and self are going out to Wimille with V., so I"ll be missing) they"d get on to Harry, Sedj., Owen, Tom, Dick, Jack &ndash; out of 14.  B.1 mess they"d get none, B.5 ?</p>
<p>248<br/>Tonight came out Hughes manifesto to the Aust. Troops re compulsion.</p>
<p>If they"re going to keep up our 5 divisions, well they"ll have to get it, yet I don"t think the chaps in the line will vote yes, but they"d be a sight fairer to themselves if they did vote 'yes".  Yes well for one thing means the more even distribution of casualties, and the keeping up to strength.  It will be a close go though.</p>
