Went down to Commercial Bank after with Mother & Al after dinner we got tickets for th hippodrome then all met at Auntie Florences' for afternoon tea & stayed there till late. Went down town afterwards to Hatchetts & had dinner then went on to the Hippodrome afterwards to see the revue "Joy-land"  it was a rotten show. When we got home we found Pitt Brown had been in & was staying at the Regents Palace hotel, so Alan & I went round to see him. We had a great old yarn & did not get home to bed till 3 AM.
