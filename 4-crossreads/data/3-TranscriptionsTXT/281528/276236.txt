 23.3.18 - Red Lodge Went down to Bde. H.Q. about 11 a.m. and saw the G. who was on his way to D.H.Q. where General Plumer was presiding at a Conference.  The day was warm and close.  Had a little council of war at the Catacombs and arranged rather stronger standing and listening patrols than usual in order to cover our relief tonight better.  The capture of a few men of 21st might mean that the Hun can get some information from them regarding our movements.  After lunch most of the rear coy. men were taken out of their dugouts and spent the afternoon sitting down in the sun.
