The passengers are a decent crowd apparently & several show signs of Cairo breeding.  Will berth at Devonport by 8 A.M. tomorrow and will take on troops during the afternoon.  I will go ashore during the morning and will post some letters of farewell. 
 Friday 21st  Reached Devonport during the night & berthed at naval wharf at 8.30.  Saw a number of battleships such as the Warspite, submarines and Destroyers.  Received orders that no one was allowed on shore whereat the passengers were very angry.  About 800 troops came on during the afternoon the Sgts and W.O.s being fearfully disgusted with their quarters which are exactly the same as the mens whereas the Government pay for a second class passage.  The Colonel, Adjutant & Embarkation officer came along to try & smooth things over
