<p>our battalion on the beach.</p>
<p>Owing to lack of discipline and confidence in our officers very few of our unit remained together. This was the same throughout the whole of the Division. It was days before we got the Bn in anything like order. The roll call after the muster was about 400 out of about 1100 of the original Bn who landed. It was an awful sight watching men walking up and down the beach looking for relations and friends.</p>
<p>We returned to the firing</p>
