<p>tea adding curry &amp; onions to a tin of rabbit.  Next morning up at 4 A.M. &amp; loaded all our gear on a barge hired by the O.C. for the remainder of journey &amp; we continued on our way to Moaska.  Even with empty waggons we had great difficulty in getting through reaching our destination at 8 A.M.  where we had breakfast.  We then proceeded through the New Zealand camp, through Ismailia picking up our gear off the barge once more &amp; then proceeded over the Santoon bridge over the canal to Ferry post.  Crossing over in an ambulance waggon the horses became unmanageable &amp; nearly toppled us in the canal.  Luckily it happened at the end &amp; did no other damage bar smashing the railing &amp; 5 minutes work under the supervision of a naval lieutenant placed the waggon on the road again &amp; we proceeded on our way.  The distance done on the second day was 15 miles which left about 8 or 10 to finish one trip.  I finished up feeling splendid for which fact I was very pleased as it showed that my recent sickness had left no ill effects.  A</p>
