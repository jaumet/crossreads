<p>home to-day. 2 of our boys wounded &amp; Sullivan evacuated sick.</p>
<p>26 August 1916 Sat<br/>Since we had our blankets taken from us some weeks back we have managed to hold of others. The Colonel comes around the tents inspecting at the same time collecting them all. Whilst on duty during the night I wrote several letters. Received notification from Horseferry Rd that my cable had been despatched [text continued at top of page]</p>
<p>27 August 1916 Sun<br/>A fairly quiet day. Slept nearly all day. One of our boys were killed up in the trenches to-day. Two are also reported missing although they have been killed for some one told me their bodies now lay over the parapet. There were also 4 wounded. Our bearers return at midnight tired &amp; worn out. It was they say a picnic there as compared with the last time</p>
