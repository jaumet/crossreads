 The army has lost a great soldier in Holmes. He had, I think, only two faults. One was that he consistently neglected his first duty of looking after himself. This is a fault one often sees with senior officers, &amp; junior ones too for that matter, and one which I think is a very [indecipherable] one.  The other fault   None will question his great ability as a soldier especially as a fighting man, I personally had a very   high opi  high opinion of him. I shall write you of my opinion of the course here as soon as things settle down a bit. Best Love to Mrs Ferguson and Dorothy Affectionatly Yours CR Lucas
