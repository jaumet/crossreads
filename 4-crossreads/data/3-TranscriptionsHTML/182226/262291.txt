<p>Sunday 26 September, 1915</p>
<p>Went to church &amp; Holy Communion.</p>
<p>Two friends of Bernie Morris came up in the evening.</p>
<p>I received G&#39;burn papers. They were very welcome and I did not know what to do with myself so I had a good long read of G&#39;burn news.</p>
<p>Today specially in the afternoon, has been the quietest that I can remember, it was just like a Sunday afternoon at home.</p>
