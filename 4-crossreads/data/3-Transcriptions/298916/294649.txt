<p>back again. Poor Sergeant did look silly &amp; we were so rude as to laugh at him, because he was so fond of telling us that "you'll learn someday". He learned anyhow. His heart's pride was his moustache &ndash; a bonzer cricketer's &ndash; eleven a side &ndash; like a doll's tooth brush. To our delight, he was put out of the saloon &ndash; not because of his "giddy giddy gout act" &ndash; &amp; had to dine with the men. In the afternoon two transports were picked up with the cruiser Minnetaur, the three of which came from Perth.</p>
<p>4th November. During the afternoon the second officer began his tricks that brought some furious words from Teddy &amp; I. He always came &amp; woke Teddy at 4pm when he finished his watch. I protested but he continued "on the bounce" &amp; Teddy took it all without a murmur. He tried it on me later on but I threatened him with sudden death. Teddy &amp; I then slipped into the third officer's room &amp; would have a chat while Captain Jackson was asleep. At night we would get the phonograph &amp; Teddy would sing to it &ndash; breaking all records (not literally). He had a bonzer voice like a nanny goat.</p>
