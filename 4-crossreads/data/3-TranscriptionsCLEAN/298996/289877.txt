Saturday 11.4.15Nice & fresh this morning, sea still in a bad mood. Hot again to day. I saw some Dolphins to day jumping quite upright out of the water to catch some flying fish from all appearances. Later just on dusk I saw a Whale which was giving us a fine display such as poulting water as it went along.
Sunday 12-4.15I woke up this morning with a beautiful sweat up. We arrived at Aden at 9.PM. we were under way again at 1.AM. which meant we did not see Aden
