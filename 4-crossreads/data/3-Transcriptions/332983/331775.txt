Very heavy firing on the right rear Battle ships, some talk of a Naval bombardment<br/>15/8/1915<br/>A most terrific night, the Asiatic guns bombarding us something cruel. This happened about 9 o'clock, hundreds of time shrapnel coming over, Our guns opened fire on them, and then the Battle ships started, This morning the warships put in about 200 shots this was at 5 A.M. They were shooting over on the Asiatic coast 4 or 5 miles away, just now they have ceased firing. 12 men of the new Zealand Artillery arrived in our lines last night, Had to send a N.C.O. to meet them<br/>A battle ship firing 4.30 A.M. Turks returning fire with time shrapnel, no where near it.
