 El Arish 
 The Railway will be here today - wonderfully quick work considering the weather. Stunt postponed owing to RAIN - Rail made 1 & 1/2 KILO per day. 
 [This paragraph crossed through.]  Health of men not too good. Barcoo Rot very prevalent owing to poor Tucker. 
 Very lousy camp this owing to Turks& Bedouins being here so long. Food is the great trouble here. 2 lbs per man of green stuff & often not that is allowed, so the men ride miles for a few Bushes etc. to cook with. This is a poor Country & the Bedouins are starving. They sift the horse manure for the few grains to be got out of it.
