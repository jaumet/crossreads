  
 23/5/19 London some ground every day in tubes etc. In the evening went down to Soho - a dirty quarter but like stepping into France or Italy to see the signs "Epicerie" "Ristoranto" etc. Had dinner at Cafe d'Italie - a very warm close night and the place ill ventilated. From here round to Leicester Sq. and then to the regions round Horseferry Road a low dingy dark locality full of brawling women. Tenements and drunks. And some of our men when on leave never get out of this beastly quarter. Things on the whole seemed fairly quiet and until about 11.30 I wandered round Piccadilly - too hot for theatres so crowds were promenading. I have seen a good many places but for pure mercenary cold vice give me this city of London. A hard cruel place and a hell for a man or woman without money I should think.
