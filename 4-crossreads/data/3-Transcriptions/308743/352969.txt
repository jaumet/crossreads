<p>13 May 1915<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Spent a fairly good night although the artillery kept us awake for a while, rifle fire was consistent all through.  At 4 AM Stand to arms in case of an attack at dawn, Went for a shot during the morning fired 50 rds then came down &amp; took over the phones artillery (all guns) going a treat now both from our field guns &amp; the naval are giving them fits, shrapnel bursting all round us, Turkish explosive bullets exploding everywhere, three or four wounded were down this afternoon also one prisoner poor beggar he seemed glad to be out of it.  Turks using an awful amount of trench mortars, LH doing well &amp; move, had another go at the turks with 40 rds hit a periscope &amp; think a sniper also. Lizzie booming away  Wills &amp; Burrell still with mountain Bty where are constantly under fire.  Turks attack at 6 but are repulsed.  Bed at 10</p>

<p>Stand to arms at 4.<br/>Things very quiet at night only a little rifle fire early in the morning their guns are shelling heavily the trenches on our right front, one gun we placed there last week was blown to bits.  Our interpreters were caught sketching this morning &amp; they were sent back to Alexandria, T snipers very bad this morning &amp; they got 13 of the 3rd Brig who are not yet in action.  Sappers at work on Razor back to blow it up with L mines work proceeding very satisfactory up to late last night.  Artillery duds throughout the day. Gen Godley wounded in the head whilst visiting our trenches.  I expect an attack on the Razor tonight, Turks using plenty of bombs &amp; blowing our periscopes to blazes met Jim Brice of the 3rd Brig last night, had another go at sniping with 40 rds; Bate bagged a sniper.  Bed at 10.</p>
