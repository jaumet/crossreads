<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So much for Longford Castle which provided a very pleasant afternoon&#39;s enjoyment for Captains Lansell and Trebilcock, and Lieuts.Hughie McColl and myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to Salisbury, dinner at the Old George Inn and on the 8 o&#39;clock bus to Amesbury (8 miles) then a two mile walk back to camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I tell you that the third Division expect to move to France early in November, it is now an established fact and we wind up our days on Salisbury Plain with a twelve day programme of specialist training and on Saturday start four days final leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My final leave this time will be busy, I&#39;m thinking of going to Hastings to see Battle Abbey and the site of King Harold&#39;s Battle in 1066, and have some business too in London and do not think that I can go to Plymouth to see relatives thistime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Love to all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.</p>
