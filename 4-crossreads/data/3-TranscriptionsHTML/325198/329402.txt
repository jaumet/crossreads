<p>30 Nov, 1916<br/>Bayoud<br/>I struck picquet last night; I did first shift so the duty was'nt too severe as I finished my shift at 11.20.  It was with a sort of feindish delight that I hauled long Sam out of his warm bed to releive me &amp; it was nice &amp; comforting to think of him out in the cold while I was  turning in to my snug nest.  Theres a squeaky little bird dancing round in front of my bivy just now he is doing well on flies &amp; he ought to get fat the perky little beggar, for there are plenty I wish he would bring all his cobbers along &amp; clean the lot up.</p>
<p>Time <u>3.30</u>   I was sent out to no 2 observation post this afternoon, Thommo &amp; I took first shift, he was telling me some yarn when we heard the Burr Burr of an Areoplane - we looked &amp; could see nothing &amp; thought we might have been mistaken but just as he started on his yarn again we heard the "Burr" once more &amp; after looking a while we "picked her up" a white bright spec high in the blue; we put our glasses on her &amp; though not sure of her identity we had our suspisions that she was a Taube.  these were justified 2 mins later when she turned her body glinting in the sun, &amp; showed the black crosses on her wings, just then she moved over the camp &amp; we heard several explosions but there was no damage done &ndash; I think she scooted off to wards the East</p>
