<p>Apl 7 aboard the last one. Most of the Engines use coal (in oblong blocks) which does not emit black smoke, but it pongs some. It's a damned disgrace the way we (volunteers) are treated. Bread &amp; tea for brek, no dinner, &amp; the following for 24 hours dry ration, &frac14; loaf bread, 1 oz cheese, no jam &amp; no butter, and thats what we get for doing our bit, anyhow 7 of us vamoosed bought 7 lbs of steak fried it at a wine shop, &amp; then wired in: - Steaks, bread &amp; butter, coffee, cakes, wine &amp; cigarettes, &amp; the whole lot cost only about 2 francs each (1/8). Paraded to the officers but got nil, guess they tucker well though.</p>
<p>8 Kit bags going to base depot, &amp; we are leaving here next week. Several chaps before Orderly Room today, chiefly for being late on parade. Rotten breakfast, only bully beef bread &amp; tea. Great feed for 3 hours drill. All peninsula hands are on water fatigue while</p>
