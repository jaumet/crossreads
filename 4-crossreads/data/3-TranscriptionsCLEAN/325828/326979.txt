 Postscript at top:  Had a p/c from Carl Hansen (Nurse Hansen's brother) from London Hosp. where he had been sent wounded.  Leo. 
 My dearest Father, Saw Wal two or three times last week.-  Went to his possy one afternoon & spent the afternoon with him, following afternoon we went into town, and saw him again for a short time again yesterday. He  is  was expecting to shortly get his leave to England & was looking forward to a good time. No word from Rid yet since the first note, so must hope that no news is good news. Haven't heard any more about my leave yet but expect it won't be very long now before I get it. We have had it bitterly cold & very wet weather here since I last wrote a week ago. Please tell Olwen I received her letter of Aug 7th yesterday, with many thanks, but am unable to answer it this mail. Am keeping in splendid health.  Trust this finds you all well at home. With much love to all, Your loving son  Leo.
