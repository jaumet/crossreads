 13.8.15 Friday 13th.  A German Taube was flying over us about sundown yesterday, when one of our planes came on the scene &amp; chased the Taube, a second Taube rose to help, &amp; our machine appeared to think it was time to quit &amp; came back.  Otherwise everything quiet, a little shelling. 
 14.8.15 Sat. 14th.  Another quiet day;  last night the Turks were burning dead bodies &amp; the fumes we get here are nearly enough to make us use our respirators.  The Turks have been coming out of their trenches during the night time &amp; collecting the boots off our dead &amp; one was shot dead last night while in the act;  demonstration last night. 
 15.8.15 Sun. 15th.  The Turks made a determined bomb attack last night on the right flank, but were easily repulsed &amp; strange to say our casualties were practically nil.  The Turks suffered heavily.  Everything in Monash Gully very quiet.
