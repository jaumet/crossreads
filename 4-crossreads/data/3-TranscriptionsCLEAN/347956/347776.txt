 I saw yesterday the first sailing boat of any size I have ever seen:  no fruit is allowed to be bought out to us & the food is something awful the last day or so, two or three steam launches have come alongside with officers from other boats to pay us a visit. it is very amusing to watch the natives scrambling for pennies that we throw in their boat for them.  we wanted them to dive for them but they said, too many bigfish - catch you, some of the natives got enough money to-day the last them for many a day, as the troopers even threw shilling pieces to them when the coppers ran out.  the darkies would nearly go mad with excitement when the were lucky enough to catch a shilling  Apparently they know the value of our money
