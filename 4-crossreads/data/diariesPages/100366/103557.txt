 
never went out today & remained in my bivouac most of the time. Great news is to hand from the Somme front, the British having made a further big advance & captured a large number of prisoners. You will no doubt have read of the big Armoured Motor Tractors being used for the first time. These are gigantic things built on the Caterpillar wheel system & able to safely negotiate any hill as well as taking a 12 ft trench safely. They are armed with heavy guns & do an immense deal of damage when they get going.

There are persistent rumours that the Germans have asked for an armistice & if this is so, it certainly shows a weakness. In our opinions it will be impossible for them to hold such a big front during the winter months & everyone is expecting to hear of them falling back on a shorter front directly. Of course it will have to be very carefully planned as we have a nice little packet of 40,000 cavalry waiting to get through the minute the last line of trenches are reached.

The 3rd Division have not yet declared War, consequently they are still in England, presumably having a good time. To say that we are jealous would be to express it mildly.
