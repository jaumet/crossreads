<p>1916 &nbsp; WEDNESDAY 31 &nbsp; MAY</p>
<p>Raining like hell most of the day, and fairly cold; but one can feel it getting warmer every day now as we get closer to land. I was mess orderly for the day and its a rotten job. I had to stay down below all day, so I read most of the time. I finished John Oxenhams book &quot;Rising Fortunes&quot; Its not a bad book but not up to his others. I slept up on deck last night and it was a wild night too. I neaarly got blown away a couple of times.</p>
