<p>17th August (Thursday)</p>
<p>Raining last night and wet today.  In morning more squad drill.  Afternoon off.  T.W. Howard was today decorated.  Newspapers report King George under fire in France.  This is a source of great amusement here because the King didn't go any further than a nervous child would go.  This evening we went to the Pictures in La Gorgue.  New Zealand Artillery moving in Somme direction.</p>
<p>18th August (Friday)</p>
<p>Went to the dentists' at No. 1 Clearing Hospital this morning.  More agony in the shape of squad drill this afternoon.  Out for tea as usual after 5.30 p.m.  Rumours that 22,000 Tommies arrive on Sunday.  Not very pleasing to the inhabitants.<br/>Raining hard tonight.</p>
