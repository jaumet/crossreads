 16 July 1918 Tuesday Thank goodness we are relieved tonight-  the men are fairly done, half dead with Malarial, they have HEARTS like LIONS.  The German prisoners said "You" "Australians are good fighters" "we thought we were " "attacking INDIANS"  the latter are good loyal Allies &amp; I don't want to detract from their gallant help. Since I wrote above a lot has happened the enemy got on to us with 4.2" &amp; blew H--- out of us-  Only 1 of my horses left-  62 killed 32 Horses wounded &amp; my 2 I/C Captain Badge killed.  However we leave tonight; for a spell of 2 weeks anyway in the HILLS.
