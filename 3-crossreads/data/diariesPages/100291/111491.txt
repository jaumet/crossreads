Some more bombard ? again last night.
A couple of infantry through victims to snipers, one in leg another lucky devil with just the skin broken on the apple of his throat, caused by a bullet ? a near shave. Yet another with slight scalp wound in front of head. Just taken his helmet off to scratch head when shell fragment hit him. Many peculiar things happen at times. Raid by 4th Brig. successful last night. capture 80 prisoners hold Fritz front line.
