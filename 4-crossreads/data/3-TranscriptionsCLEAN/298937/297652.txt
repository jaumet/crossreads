  
 a chance before, of seeing the effect of the war on these fine people. Had they come here first, they would have played the game all the while. Truly the war is doing good in an indirect way. 
 Sunday 13th Aug. 
 Went to Marseilles again yesterday & visited Notre Dame de la Grande, the fine Roman Catholic Cathedral on a hill to the  west  east of the town. Travelled by tram part of way & then walked up hill
