<p>26<br/>11/7/16<br/>Heavy bombarding last night, watched several aerial fights, schrapnel bursting right above us. The aeroplanes seemed to live charmed lives.</p>
<p>Saw Sam marching through last night rode after him on the bike.</p>
<p>12/7/16.<br/>Left Sailly to-day &amp; am back at Merris but only for the night.</p>
<p>Had a great time the night before leaving Sailly the people at the house gave us a little send-off in the shape of a supper. The Adjutant joined us &amp; we had a very lively time. Most of the fun was caused in trying to understand one another. They were grand people &amp; were very sorry we had to leave, so was I.</p>
