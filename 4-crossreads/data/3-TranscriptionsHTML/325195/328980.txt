<p>23.10.15<br/>Sat 23rd<br/>The rain ceased at 6 oclock this morning: I could not sleep at all last night but put in a very interesting night chasing fleas who were running a steeplechase over me: Received another stab over the heart this afternoon innoculated for typhoid, It was voluntary &amp; only those who wished were done; It has been very cold and cloudy all day, in fact I have had cold feet all day with 2 pairs of socks on: Long went off duty to-day sick, &amp; I have got Reid to take his place tonight: Everything is very quiet in the fighting line here; Les went to the beach this afternoon to see if he was lucky enough to buy a cake but returned with 2 tins of Herrings in Tomato Sauce &amp; 1 of Sardines</p>
