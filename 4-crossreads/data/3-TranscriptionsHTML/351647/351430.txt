<p>France<br/>21-6-17</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Its just ages &amp; ages since I've had any word at all from anyone one.  Week by week goes <strike>by</strike> &amp; nary a letter from Australia &amp; everybody is pippy &amp; anxious and scrappy.  I wonder if they have gone down.</p>
<p>The weather has been pretty heavy, not so frantically hot but very oppressive &amp; I have felt absolutely dopey.  Haven't been able to work or write or even read.  Just doped about.  Its rotten to feel like that.</p>
<p>Really one won't be sorry to get up to the line for some things.</p>
<p>I haven't got much news, there's so little to tell these days, we get leave to go to Amiens a fairly large town not too far off.  Its a change, we get there about 10 &amp; then have to prance about till 12 before we can go into cafes or anywhere.  Only British soldiers aren't allowed, you see French civilians &amp; soldiers sitting down resting &amp; feeding &amp; drinking but except between 12 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 8 Britishers may <u>not</u>.  Of course you may go &amp; see the Cathedral or sit in the parks on the seats but even in the latter</p>
