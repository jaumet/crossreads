  
 March 23rd Met some Australian soldiers here in Alexandria today.  One of them had travelled with me twice on the Coast & we recognised each other in the street.  During the fortnight I have been here, have met quite a lot of the boys from the land of the Southern Cross & by jove they are pleased to meet anyone from over there too, & the more I see of them I begin to realise what a lot of bosh & exaggeration was contained in the published statements of Bean the Official press representative who was at Cairo with them.  I went through the Camp at Mena & the men appeared to be in perfect condition, physically & morally & it struck you right away what perfect Soldiers they will make.  The majority of them are disgusted that such statements were sent home to Australia & say that although the actions of a few of the boys, arriving as they did with a cheque of 20 or so each & being in a new country & in some instances never having been away from home before, they naturally became a bit exuberant, but Beans statements were partially contained of actions by Australian soldiers & by Native & other Troops. I have met quite a lot of business men & they speak in the highest terms of them & the natives themselves simply worship them, partly because anything that they do for an Australian they are always well paid for.  Some of the boatmen related yarns of how they took an Australian soldier or soldiers ashore & of having been given 10/- & 15/- & so on
