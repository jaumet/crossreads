Frightful devastating storm at night. Thunder lightning and rain. Hellish weather all day, which developed into a veritable inferno of storm & tempest as night approached. Rain fell in torrents, the wind howled along in terrific gusts. Great damage to piers & beach works, & saps & road work in the several "deres". Some saps are have been converted into raging torrents & practically impassable.
