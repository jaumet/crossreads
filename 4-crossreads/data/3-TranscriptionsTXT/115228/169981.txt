rifle machine gun fire
kept breaking out now & then
all through the night.
Evidently our troops attacked
some Turkish positions but
so far have not heard
particulars(13.6.17 Redoubt near the
sea taken).
June 16th 17- Have been rather "off colour" for the past couple of
days & today was sent away to the
doctor to the Anzac Divisional
Field Hospital near Bela, my complaint being Tonsilitis.
Jne 25th '17 - Discharged from the
hospital today & rejoined the
Regt now resting on the beach
