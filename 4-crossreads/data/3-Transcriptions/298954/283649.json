<p>Wed 22nd (cont.)<br/>I lunched (mit Posten) in the 1st Class Potsdamerbahnhof cafe, having absolutely refused to enter the 3rd class cafe.</p>
<p>Strange to say, there was no objection to the "Englische Herr Offizier" entering the 1st class caf&eacute;, the objection was to my escort entering the Sacred Precincts!</p>
<p>Since the "Herr Offizier" said he would rather be taken to "Strafe" than enter a 3rd class caf&eacute; the objection to my poor old Landsturmer was waived, as a special concession I lunched amongst such gold-lace and well cut mufti on a Libby's veal loaf &amp; biscuits, giving my guard a small tin of sardines and a glass of beer.</p>
<p>The waiter's (ex-London Hotel) eyes bulged when I gave him the remainder of a packet of cocoa as a trinkgeld after he made me a pot from same.</p>
