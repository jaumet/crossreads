 Saturday 17th November 1917 
  Red X wife &ndash; watch at Porter &amp; Smith.  
 Found I had to pay 55/-/- passage money self &amp; wife!!!  I anticipated the Red X would pay her fare. 
 Then visited Laura at the Hospital, she is getting on well. I saw a good deal of young Charlie yesterday, we had lunch together &amp; he is a bonny boy &amp; I think will look after his Mother. Brace is in London but I don't see much of him.
