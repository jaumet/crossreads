  
 She was soon downstairs & I had breakfast & then a shave & clean up.  I lay down part of the morning & in the afternoon.  J. & I went out for a walk & booked seats at the Theatre.  We went to the show at night at 9 p.m.  We filled in the afternoon by the Drawing Room fire or I played the Piano.  I met Ben Henry that is the eldest Boy.  He is quite nice but real quiet.  Uncle is the same.  Real slow, quiet Yorkshiremen.  Well Mum, I will wind up now and give Dad the rest of the news when I write to-night.  The Heads have come & gone & I will go out for a stroll round the Block before Tea.  Regards to all my old Friends.  Tell 'em I can't write. 
 Fond Love to you all Harry
