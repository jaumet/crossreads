<p>Monday, 5 July, 1915<br/>Arrived at Lemnos before daybreak went right in Mudros just the same.  We were lined up and told that we were to take the boat back with wounded and as soon as the big move was made to Kilid Bahr &amp; Achi Baba from Anzac we would rejoin our Brigade, may the advance come soon is our earnest prayer.  We were allotted to wards &amp; in each there will be a sister in charge, I was paid a compliment by being placed in the operating theatre, two of us to assist the surgeons this is usually only a medical students position.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 6 July, 1915<br/>Last night after I wrote my diary up we received our first load of wounded &amp; sick off a mine sweeper just before we picked them up they were chased by a submarine but eluded her.  All day batches of wounded &amp; sick arrived until we were nearly full up, we are all disgusted with the sisters they are more nuisance than enough they lose their heads and are rushing round giving orders like old chooks, women are all right but they must have a man to do the thinking for them, they cannot understand us, they thought we were raw an inexperienced and now that they have found out we are not mugs at hospital work they are foolishly jealous of it.  We had a few minor operations in the theatre to-day, bullet extracs etc.  all the other L.H.F.As [Light Horse Field Ambulance] have been sent back to Mudros as they are only fooling about at Gaba Tepe.</p>
