14.4.15Wed. 14th.  Mounted parade with Squadron;  had a fair amount of Signalling with H.Q. this morning & had dinner in the shade of the Palm trees & returned to Camp shortly afterwards.  The Colonel appeared to be in a rather bad humor all day & gave us a bit of a lecture before we started on the parade, he says we are getting rather slack in our work.  Was boxing with Conway after tea.  We were to start on an 8 days bivouac tomorrow, but the Transports are getting repaired, & it has been postponed.
