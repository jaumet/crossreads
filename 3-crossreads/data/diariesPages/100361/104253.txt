Friday June 14th
Today we got a weekly pass from the D.O.R. for working at the Y.M.C.A. We are still rolling the floor, which is good exercise. At night "Tam" and I went to another whist drive. Just a quite affair ? mostly old maids attend. I was strolling quietly home to Camp when I met the A.P.M.and his posse of "Jacks". He pulled me up and asked to see my pass. I got quite a shock when he said it was twenty to twelve. They took my pass, also my name and number and told me to report myself under open arrest as soon as I arrived back in Camp. Some old "Romeo" was warbling "When you come to the end of a Perfect day" in a house near the camp. It appealed to me.
Saturday June 15th
My Birthday. This is the 4th I have spent as a member of the A.I.F. and I don't care how soon I spend one as a member of the R.S.A. Col. Astbury and I celebrated it by drinking two of the best in the Canteen. I wonder if B.E. is thinking of me today.
About mid-day "Tam" and I knocked off at the Y.M. and went in for a cup of coffee. One of the other chaps came in and said that "Mr Opie, the Y.M. boss" wanted to pay us. It was quite a surprise as we didn't expect it. Anyhow we drew 5 bob, and very handy it was too. At night we went into Town and visited the market where things can be bought very cheap. Got 2 glorious long Letters from M.S.
