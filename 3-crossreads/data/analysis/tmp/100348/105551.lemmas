 5/4/16 . We have been travel for a whole day through the most enchant sceneri I have ever seen . I had not dream that anyth could be so beauti . It is spring time here and the orchard are in bloom ; Such green grass , such blue sky and sea , it is great to rest one 's eye on such a vivid contrast of colour after the burn desert sand of Egypt . It is good to see the smile face of the French peopl .They give us a great recept . A pretti , black-ey mademoisell , came to my carriag and distribut boquet of field flower . One of the chap ask her what she thought of Australian soldier . She said we were like a lot of brigand ment as a complement I suppos , on our easi manner . We pass Lyon at 5 A.M. so leav the south of Franc behind us .
