 THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1919. 
 Fine. I was knocking round 
 with Alan all day. Al &amp; I took 
 two of the nurses from Lady 
 Carnarvon&#39;s hospital to dinner 
 &amp; then on to &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; after. 
 It was a jolly good show and 
 Dot Brunton was very good 
 indeed. We all went round 
 to Rector&#39;s after to a dance.
