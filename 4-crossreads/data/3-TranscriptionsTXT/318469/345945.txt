by them for a long time.  Our Artillery lively as usual.  A Taube flew over but sooner "Imsbid" after dropping a couple of bombs some where near our Trench evidently afraid of being hit by numbers of M Guns fired at him.
3rdNot much doing today.  Roughly same as yesterday.
4thSeveral thousand "Tommies" arrived last night evidently to take part in the attack to be carried out very soon.  There are now active preparations for an attack in the near future.  About 6 a.m. a Taube flew over the "Tommies" dropped a couple of bombs but without results.  Heavy bombardment by our Howitzer & lively reply by Enemy.  Alls well
5thMore Tommies arrived last night & more 6th Re Inforcements.  Expect big bombardment by our Guns tonight.
6.8.15Today has been a very eventful one.  Early in the forenoon 9 howitzers & 18 pounders began a heavy bombardment which became more intense as the day advanced while in the afternoon 2 Monitors & a couple of Cruisers took a hand.  At times the bombardment of the Turkish lines was terrific our Howitzer shell doing great work.  About 3 p.m. 4th Battl charged & took the "Lone Pine" & held it.  Bombardment has continued right into the night.  The Turks did not reply so vigorously as excepted altho' they put a lot of shell in & there fire becoming more effective after dark.  Our casualties not very heavy.
