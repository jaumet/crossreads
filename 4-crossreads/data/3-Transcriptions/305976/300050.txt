<p>blocking the road makes travelling slow. Getting supplies is a big undertaking as the railway is finished at Jerusalem &amp; they have to be brought in by Motor Lorry a distance of over 40 miles. We arrived at village about 6 pm &amp; opened up 3RD receiving first. We had bout 40 casualties pass through during evening. The great difficulty here is that there is no Transport available for wounded. Receiving stations have been opened at Esault but the casualties have nearly 50 miles of travelling to do before they reach the casualty</p>
