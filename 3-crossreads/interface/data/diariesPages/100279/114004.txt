Last night coming home from the trenches I took my boots off walked the boards in my socks.
Had a good long sleep during the day just at tea time Mr. Page came round with an order that we were to proceed to the firing line at once had to be at Rexham Rd at 6.15 that left us  an hour to have tea, pack, push off in, after reaching the firing line put my "reliefs" on. I then took "the watch" till 9. nothing happened during the night. The majority of the men come off at day-light for they are too exposed.
31st What do you think of this our sentries the Germans exchange greetings any time of the day, we are both in full view of one another it seems to be a mutual agreement for neither sides to shoot, we are only 60 or 70 yds away, you can go out any
