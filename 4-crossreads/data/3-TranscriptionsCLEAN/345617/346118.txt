  
 Juillet 15 Had a quiet day today. Very little work except [indecipherable] fatigues. We had a massed Coy photo taken this morning but I do not expect it to be any good as the conditions of the weather & position were not favourable. Went to Service in the Church Army Hut in the evening. 
 Juillet 16. Nos 1 & 2 Sections had route march in the morning - about 18.K. Route - Corbie - Port Noyelles - [indecipherable] - Corbie. Inspection of shortages in equipment & clothing in afternoon. Nothing of importance to report as regards our own affairs. Heavy attacks on the French in Champagne District. Heavy losses to [indecipherable] French gains. Russians doing well.
