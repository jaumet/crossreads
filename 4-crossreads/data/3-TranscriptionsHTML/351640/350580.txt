<p>In a place called Sakaraha [also spelt Saqqara], which was the burrying ground of Memphis, &ndash; this being the name of the City, which existed, on the banks of the Nile near here, before Cairo was, &ndash; under one of the ancient dynasties, 'twas the custom to encasket sacred bulls.  Each of these had for himself a toomb magnificent in its proportions &amp; grand in its decorations.  "My Commedian" who nine times out of ten is wrong in his statements &amp; opinions, said at breakfast that the bulls had been removed from the toombs to the Egyptian Museum.  I therefore asked the Curator during my visit:-  Where are the sacred bulls from Sakaraha?  He replied:/  "I know but of the existence of two of them, and they are in New York.  When Mr. Roosefelt [Roosevelt] was here he asked me the same question &amp; when I told him that the two were in New York he nearly fell against the wall, &amp; on recovering said, "Oh!  I must look them up on my return to the United States, that they may be set out in some public place for general inspection" there are none of them here. &ndash; I do not know whether the bulls were buried in the flesh or by representation, probably in the flesh, becoming in due course mummified.</p>
<p>Some of the mummy figures of Rameses and other Kings of Egypt, were interesting to the student of anatomy, &amp; had my leisure been more ample and my health better I would have learned more about them, but the place closed at 4-30 p.m., and I was wretchedly sick while wandering round, reading &amp; listening to the curator.</p>
