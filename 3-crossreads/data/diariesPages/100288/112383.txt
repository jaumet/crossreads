for an hour on the edge of the Suez Canal. This side of canal lined with trees for a depth of about 20 yds; very fortunate to have shelter as sun is very strong during day Large Cruiser passed down Canal during morning, as well as a number of other large boats. Working all day unloading goods from boats. Very short of rations, all we had for today was 6 biscuits bully beef; quite satisfied, cannot expect much more on active service. Allotted to tents at night; very glad to turn in.
