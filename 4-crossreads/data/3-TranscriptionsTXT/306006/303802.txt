 2-4-17 Mon 2nd Hospital trains have been running backwards &amp; forwards fairly constant &amp; today we can hear the faint booming of guns probably from the warboats; No competition matches were played today on account of the 1st Regt playing the Field Ambulance &amp; Machine Gun Sqdn it was a great game &amp; resulted in a draw once more, they decided to play an extra 10 minutes, but even then there was no score. A lecture tonight in the YMCA every evening there is some entertainment there but I never go down as I have been putting in the evenings writing.
