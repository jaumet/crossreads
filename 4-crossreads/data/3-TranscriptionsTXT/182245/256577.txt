 3 SATURDAY 
 Fine &amp; fairly sunny though cooler 
 than usual. We shifted 
 up into the stables just 
 vacated by the 27 th &nbsp;Battery 
 &amp; we have a bit more room 
 there. Got all our old harness 
 pegs ect up. Got the other 
 sweater from Polpero in 
 evening. Heard a roumer 
 that we may be shifting 
 shortly, but hope its not 
 true. Four waggons went 
 up at night with amunition 
 but I did not have to go
