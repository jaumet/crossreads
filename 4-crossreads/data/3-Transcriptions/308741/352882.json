<p>Dear Vol</p>
<p>Just a short note to let you know I'm cooling off at above address, for a 6 months course.  Sympathise with me, please.  Your letters lately have been going astray somewhere, because I know you write when you can.  I haven't heard from George lately but have written him today.  His Btn. has, I think, been in action on the Somme, not certain.</p>
<p>The political situation of Aussie has got me boxed up so completely that I don't understand</p>
