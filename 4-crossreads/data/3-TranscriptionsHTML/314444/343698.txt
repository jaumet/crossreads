<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Just after posting your letter about the rumour, it came officially that we could not send any more for six or seven weeks. Now don't get uneasy as I will write as soon as they allow us. if anything happens I will have a cable sent immediately.<br/>I expect we are going to tackle them &amp; drive "em" well back. If so you can bet your son will be well in it. I hate them that much. Remember if I do fall, my thoughts are always with you, &amp; I am</p>
