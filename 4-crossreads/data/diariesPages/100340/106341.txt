that it would be turned down. As I wrote all my views about it recently I will not repeat them again as we are limited to two pages here. I think all the boys here are keeping their spirits up very well. It is only when one is alone that he gets a bit downhearted but taking it right through it is wonderful the amount of fun one can get out of this life. We were to have held our brigade sports today but they were postponed owing to the bad weather. Am sorry to say that a lot of the old faces I knew before are missing now. You see I was away about ten months there were some pretty hard stunts during my absence. I overestimated my fitness the other day played football have been pretty sore ever since. What do you think of the pretty ink I made it out of indelible pencil. Well dear old Sis give my love kindest regards to all Vol's people, a bundle of kisses for my little niece fondest love to you Vol from your brother Hal.
