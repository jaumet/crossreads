  
 Mon 3rd Sep. (cont.) We bluffed through - it may have been minutes or it may have been hours later when the torpedo doors were lifted and the tension slackened. 
 The chief doctor was quite green in the face (he is a fine chap really but his heart is weak and goes back on him at moments like this.) 
 The young doc. with the round tortoise-shell spectacles and the face like a benevolent, educated old sow was, however, as cool as if doing his usual morning rounds! 
 Hans Biester, our boastful fat orderly, was an arrant coward. 
 This morning I asked to be allowed aft again when the Doc. came to see me.   "Na, my leetle English friend, how did you like the cruiser?" he asked. "Oh, that!" I replied indifferently, "that is nothing". 
 "Nothing!" he queried, with a twinkle in his eye.   And then he winked! 
 The old boy has a sense of humour.
