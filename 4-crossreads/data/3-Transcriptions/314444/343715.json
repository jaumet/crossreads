<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>I expect this will be the last mail before Xmas. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. I only wish that I was there wouldnt we have a great time. Never mind I hope we are there by next Christmas. That will be the time. Fizz eh &amp; plenty of Ale &amp; wine. I might have a chance of spending Xmas at Hallstow If I do it will be great. It is nice &amp; fine today &amp; I went for a long walk through the country lanes. They are very pretty. I hope you are all enjoying good health.<br/>Best wishes &amp; love<br/>Your loving Son</p>
