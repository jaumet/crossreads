Thursday September 5. 1918. 1493.Fine but cool & cloudy. Yesterday we shifted our horse lines across the road to a German stable that was lately occupied by some of our artillery transports. It is on the edge of marsh that forms part of the river here.14,600 prisoners have been taken since the first of the month.The limbers were loaded & shifted to the stables today & in the evening orders came through to move forwards. We got away after tea. The roads were very dusty, in fact suffocating for there was a lot of traffic. Presently a storm blew up. Thunder & lightning & heavy rain which lasted half an hour. Many were wet through I had an oil skin in the limber. On the way the Perch pole of one of the cookers broken when crossing the railway near Hem & had to be left behind. We reached our destination after 8 p.m. & camped in an open field, pitching a cover against a bank alongside some Scotch & Welsh burial parties. Fortunately the rain cleared & the night was fine.
Friday Sept 6. 1918. 1494.A fine morning. Yesterday when we ascended the hill coming from Curlu we could see the smoke of about a dozen big fires on the skyline. The heavy rain failed to put some of them out.
