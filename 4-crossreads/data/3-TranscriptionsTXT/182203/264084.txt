We are very comfortable here & should like very much to be on the Staff here but no such luck.Last Monday had a busy day at Headquarters, pay-office etc.Tuesday, shopped in the morning, had luncheon at a large shop named Selfridges. Then went to Westminster Abbey & it took all the afternoon & then felt as if we had only passed through. It is a most wonderful place & of course full of interest, so sorry  I cannot go into detail but hope to do so when I return. Some of the very old momuments are covered up with sand-bags to protect them from the air-raids. It would be an awful thing if the old Abby was distroyed. We also saw The Westminster Cathedral (R.C.) which is a beautiful building, not yet finished. Had dinner at "Fleming's Restaurant" & enjoyed it - we have fearful appetites & are enjoying civilized food again.Wednesday went out to Harefield Park
