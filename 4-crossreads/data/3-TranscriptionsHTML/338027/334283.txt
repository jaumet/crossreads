<p>Thursday, 10th December, 1914<br/>When we were ashore yesterday some of the sergeants for a joke got the second engineer tight then dressed him in uniform &amp; took him ashore the joke however had a serious ending as he was arrested when he came back on serious charges wearing kings uniform without authority, ridiculing the rank &amp; absence without leave.  They were all punished accordingly one of the sergeants losing a stripe, whilst the engineer resigned.</p>
