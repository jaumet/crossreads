<p>You'll be interested to hear Spencers' former tea room manager is now<br/>521120, Private W. K. Murchie<br/>No 5. Canadian General Hospital<br/>Kirkdale<br/>Liverpool<br/>England<br/>and that B.C. headed the list in the Canadian Call to Arms.</p>
<p>"Squire, Milk or Cocoa?" "Jock" the Ward Orderly wakes me up. A "froggie" walks through with "Theee Deleeee Mayle". We're sick of war news.<br/>"Mon ami avez vous le dernier numero de "La Vie Parisienne" ou "Le Sourire?" I anxiously ask.<br/>"Mais Oui mon vieux les voici!" comes the delightful answer. "Thank GAWD!" (spelt with four capitals)</p>
<p>All the books I've found in the ward are two &ndash; one Robinsoe Crusoe the other Oliver Goldsmith's unconciously true life of that TERRIBLE OLD WOWSER "The Vicar of Wakefield".<br/>"The Vicar of Wakefield" to quote my immemorial Popsy Wops once more "Rolled Oats in abundance" with thick side whiskers.<br/>If you haven't had the "pleasure" do just read it.  It's part of the process &ndash; <u>"Eprouver des Sensations"</u> and certainly a literary No. 9 Pill in military hospital parlance after "La Boheme S'amuse"</p>
<p>I must say I have enjoyed this afternoon. Just a real heart to heart talk with the Gwenny Pops. In my last letter I mentioned the medical card above my bed "Incontinence urine" [asterisk &ndash; see footnote below] You have absolutely nothing to worry about on my account. Dear Girl I just pray day and night that you may be well and happy and I feel sure that some of those French books however "pollison" they might at first seem will cause many a quick smile and twinkle in the corner of my dear little wife's eyes. Love to all at home. Yours convalescently<br/>Vasco xxxxx for ever and ever and ever.<br/>(not convalescently.) xxxxx. "By Christ what are you writing, a Book artist?" The lastest!</p>
<p>[asterisk] again I repeat, English is no language for lovers.</p>
