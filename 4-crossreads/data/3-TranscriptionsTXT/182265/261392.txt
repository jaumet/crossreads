11th This morning I slept in late. When Westwood came in it was about 11am. So we waited here at Hotel Moderne for lunch. I wrote to Jay & prepared postcards for the post. This afternoon we visited Bastille, Boulevarde Germain, Chambre des Deputes, Effel Tower, the Great Wheel on which we went.
Returning we went through Commerce a very busy shopping suburb. Here I bought a few articles for Billee.
A tube (Metro) brought us to Madeleine from near Rue Royale in which is the famous Maximes where we had a couple of Manhattans with another Australian officer we met there.
After Maximes we walked Boulevards des Capuccines & continued right along the street to Republique.
After dinner we had an interesting conversation with Miss O'Connor an Australian Artiste who has lived many years in Paris & Madame Rieu whose husband, an Englishman, was killed two months ago in The Foreign Legion of France
