 Army Corps Headquarters, Anzac Cove, 20th May, 1915. 
 Circular Memorandum 
 It is with the deepest regret that I have to announce to the Army Corps the death on the 19th instant of Major General W.T.Bridges, C.M.G., Commander of the Australian Division. General Bridges has proved himself a most gallant soldier and excellent commander. To me personally his loss is a grevious blow; no Commander could have received more loyal and devoted service than I have received at all times from General Bridges. To him the Australian Division owes a debt which it can never repay for his untiring and unselfish labours, which are responsible for the high state of organization to which the Division has been brought in every detail. 
 The high ideals he placed before all ranks will I hope go down to the honour of his name as long as the Military history of Australia lasts. 
 (S'gd) W.R. BIRDWOOD, Lieut-General, Commanding Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.
