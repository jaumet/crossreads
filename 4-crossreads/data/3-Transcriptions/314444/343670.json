<p>a machine gun. Thank Heaven I am made of the right stuff. Same as you Dad afraid of nothing. If I do happen to go under you can always say, I done my duty well &amp; who was never afraid to do anything.<br/>Kitchner visited here yesterday and we hear there is a peace conference on. Lets hope they agree. It must be costing a tremendous amount to keep this place going<br/>We will all be glad to see Snowy when he comes. We can do with some reinforcements in fact a good few. I often think of the gropers we used to catch. I believe I could put a 10 lb away with a couple of bottles of ale.<br/>What is wrong with Bannister ask him did he get my letters also Bill I have written to them all.<br/>I had a letter from Miss Hayes. Very nice one too. Tell Edna Johnnie Walker is not going too strong at present but hope to be up to mark shortly.<br/>Hoping you are all well &amp; enjoying good health. Love to all &amp; kind regards to friends<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
