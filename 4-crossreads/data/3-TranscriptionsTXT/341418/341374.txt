 June 5th A disaster has overtaken us!  We have been  incontinently booted out of our pleasant little retreat beneath the Palm trees, consequent upon the arrival of the rest of the corps to this district. The place in which we are now situated is on the top of a hill on the bare sand. By the way, the aeroplane reports that there are thirteen Turkish dead lying    dead   where we had the scrap beyond Bir el Abd, so we did not do so badly after all. I have drawn a map of the district below.
