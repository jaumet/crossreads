<p>Friday 8 November<br/>March from Villers to Hangest where we entrain &amp; move off en route to Epehy, just north of Roisel.</p>
<p>Saturday 9 November<br/>Ye Gods! we have only reached Epehy this evening after thirty hours to do 90 miles.  In fact one stop lasted at Roisel for 7 hours. Epeny is of course just West of the Hindenburg System &amp; the country is devastated.</p>
