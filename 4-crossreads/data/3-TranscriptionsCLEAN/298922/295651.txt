MoascaArrived Moascar & took over command 1st L.H. Training Regiment. May stop here a bit but await instructions from Division, very cold at night now but bright fresh sunny days. [The remainder of the page crossed through.]  Col. McLeish Remount Depot is just behind me & I called on him, he sent regards to JOE. Please send MAY some of the snap shots of Dolly I sent last letter, I have no other photos here but will send as soon as I get one.
