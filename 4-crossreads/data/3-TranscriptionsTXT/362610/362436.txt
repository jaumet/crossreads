 Tuesday 8 August 1916 Still dry &amp; hot. Going round units &amp; attending a lecture at St. Ouen by the Army Chemical Adviser during the morning. In the afternoon rode out to Vignacourt to try &amp; get refill for my electric torch &amp; one or two other things. A heavy pull going out but much better returning.
