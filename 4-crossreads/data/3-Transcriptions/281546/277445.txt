<p>Sunday 2/3/19<br/>around to see where we were, <strike>and</strike> I found out that we were alongside the Wharf opposite Calais Maratime Station, and the name of the Boat was the "Arundel" a Twin screw Boat of about 2000 Tons. At 9-15am all was on board and we left for Blighty. The Weather was cloudy and a little rain but no wind, so we had a good trip over. We did not know if we were making for Dover or Folkstone, anyhow after 1 &frac12; hours steaming at about 20 knots, and going through Mist, we arrived at the Wharf and it was Folkstone, we all were soon ashore and away along the Platform &amp; up stairs and still continued on and eventually arrived at the Train and soon was aboard, At 11-15 am we pulled out and away, On the journey we passed through several long Tunnels, and in one long one the Train almost came to a stand, and we were somewhat alarmed, being an Engineman myself and the Train was moving steady I passed the opinion that repairs to the line</p>
