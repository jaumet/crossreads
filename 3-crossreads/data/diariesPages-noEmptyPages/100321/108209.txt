After a talk with Davis and Gorman this morning I visited the Echo Office. From there went down to see Jack who is in bed unwell and from there to H Smith's dwelling where he is being killed by kindness. Took a walk up the town and found Ecole Berlitz closed. Nothing else of interest. One sees few good looking girls here ? those who are belles are unhealthy in appearance. In their custom of public urination the women here are nearly as bad as the men of the place. Visited Jack again during the evening and he seemed better. Believe that a few officers unworthy of the name have been hitting up things at Cafe Centrale elsewhere.
