<p>At the head of Monash Gully is Popes Post and between it and Quinns Post, there lay a strip of neutral ground, which both sides had endeavoured to hold.  Halfway down the Gully, a sandbag barricade was erected;  from the back of which our sniping post fired on the Turks who showed on this ground.  The enemy sniped down here and often used a machine gun on the working parties.  A number of water tanks were behind this barricade, also a supply store;  the canvas roof being full of bullet holes.</p>
<p>I visited Anzac on several occasions and saw the barbed wire entanglements in the water.  The cliffs arose almost from the waters edge, and seemed an impregnable position for a enemy to be driven from, yet, somehow it was done.  The gun known as "Beachy Bill", could shell here easily and took its toll every day of both man and beast.  It was particularly deadly on a place know as "Hell's Spit, which was a projection between Anzac and Walkers Ridge, and a small cemetery close by testified the fact.  The road here was the only way of communication, so the Turks had it well ranged.  At the back of Anzac, there was a large cemetery, said to be the biggest on the Australian front.  All graves were marked with crosses and carefully tended.</p>
<p>I saw three of our warships bombarding "Beachy Bill", one day, who was hidden in the Orange Grove, which is at the back of Gaba Tepe.  This marvellous gun was reported to be mounted on a railway truck, and the shock of discharge could send it back into a tunnel, so that was the reason why it could not be silenced.</p>
<p>A number of Maltese were employed labouring along the beach and a few Egyptians were tried.  A number of English longshoremen, generally discharged</p>
