first days abuse. The Guard called us at 4-30 am, so Mac & I had to get busy & get them out at 5 am - Only Whistles are to be blown as Reveilles, the bugles are cut out, it is a lot harder to get the men on parade. Very busy all day - men coming in - men to be paraded, Fatigue partys wanted everywhere in short everybody wanted Orderly Corporal up till 9 pm. The Boys got an issue of Tobacco, it has saved them from going on strike as most of them are stoney & no sign of any pay. A Details broke into the Canteen last night & played up generally.
There came in to B. Details today about 100 Flying Corps, they want to come under us Details - but our lot do not wish to own them, they are a flash lot - nearly everyone carrying stars or stripes - we christened them the Stars & Stripes - They actually brought a Piano & a Band, they have about 12 Motor Cycles & at least 30 Officers.
