<p>Friday February 23. 1917<br/>A cold foggy world, or rather morning.  The fog is very dense to day.  There was to be an inspection to day, so we had a general clean up of the whole camp and stables.  I posted a letter to my Father to day.  The newspapers came to hand this morning.  For some unaccountable reason there was no papers since last Saturday.<br/>There had been scarcely any artillery activity during the past few nights.</p>
<p>Saturday Feb. 24. 1917<br/>A dull cloudy morning but scarcely any fog.  There are big guns booming in the distance and close at hand at regular intervals all the morning.  In the morning I was doing odd jobs and cleaning up.  I had an early dinner &amp; went with Roy Partridge</p>
