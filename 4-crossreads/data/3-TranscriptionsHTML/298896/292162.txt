<p>etc &amp;amp it was raining most of the time. Then we chose a shell hole as a start &amp;amp dug down about 2ft, 6ft wide by 9 ft long. At dark it was only half completed but I slept in it nevertheless. Their planes were over a lot during the night &amp;amp 3 bombs were dropped close enough for us to smell the smoke and fumes. Monday night was too wet for planes but every other night he has been over.</p>
<p>Wednesday 11th.Sept.<br/> Went by car to Mons,St Cren &amp;Doingt near Peronne during a hunt round to see if some of my dispensary gear could be found which had gone astray. Found large encampments near Peronne So it will be a hot shop at nights also saw a number of large guns going forward so the bridge must now be properly rebuilt. The front very quiet &amp; we are getting ammunition and supplies forward. Spent the afternoon finishing the dugout, put in a wooden floor &amp; made it light proof which allows of a light after dark, a big consideration</p>
