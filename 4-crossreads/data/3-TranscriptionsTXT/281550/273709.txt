November
Germans did not have any objection so I took the next day off as well, I think that they weer too depressed with the last few days war report to worry at what we did.
On Thursday the 7th of November the first signs of revolution in Germany had sprung up. The Marines at the Kiel-canal revolted and are causing a lot of trouble,
There has been some street fighting. The trouble was caused through forcing the marines to go to France to fight in the trenches. To-day the 8th the trouble has spread considerably,
In Hamburg the soldiers are fighting against themselves, the marines are fighting against the Police and soldiers,
Looting and robberies are being carried out in broad daylight.
Whole companies and Battallions
