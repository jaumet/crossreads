1916   FRIDAY 20   OCTOBER
Fine, but cold. I was on stable picket all day. All the men had to go through a riding school in the morning. It was decided that all each of the batteries was to have different coloured horses so they drew for the colours in the evening & the 27th drew the black horses, much to everybodies delight, though personally I would rather have the greys.
