  
 Went on duty at 10 oclock with a corporal & 5 others & had to put in the night at the Gammo-el-ahmar Police station, slept on a form, no bed or blankets.  It didn't make any difference.  The niggers kept up a perpetual din until about 1 or 2am, but we got used to that.  They ran quite a number of native women in to goal & most of them seemed to know the way.  From what I could see I should prefer to sleep in the Police Station, than in any other part of that quarter.  We discovered 3 Tommies in a room upstairs in a dark & dingy hovel.  They had been in bed but we found them hiding underneath in their shirts.  Couldn't help laughing as they crawled out one after another.  We let them go as they promised to go straight back to barracks.  Came off duty at 7am.
