the trench opposite to him was lightly held. Patrols were constantly out till dawn came at 3 a.m. when everything was quiet once more. Friday 21 JuneNearly got  hit in the head by a bullet today; one of our 'planes was up & the Huns were firing with their machine guns. I was just drying my face with a towel after shaving. & was standing in the trench talking, & I stepped aside as Sgt. Dwyer came along & stood where I had been. There was a crack as a bullet fired at the aeroplane hit on the sergeant's steel hat, knocking a hole in it & then falling off. What luck, eh, there was I without a hat on, so it would have gone through my skull. Had a sleep & read all day, the front is very quiet & only for the artillery you would hardly know there's a war on. We saw a big black dog run across No Man's land & into the wood by Fritz's trenches today, some of them fired at him but missed him, I suppose he was carrying a message. The confounded rain came on again tonight, & it was sticky & miserable underfoot. I had to go with a party to 15 platoon, deepening & widening a trench, & it was a rotten job - you got wet if you didn't wear your macintosh, & if you did wear it you could hardly use the pick & shovel so not much work was done; didn't the chaps roar, eh!
