I was nearly caught the other day on one of these roads having lost my way, &amp; very nearly blundered right onto a direct line of fire from them.

I then crawled in behind cover &amp; got for my natural. It was no bon believe me</p>
<p>1.10.16  Sunday</p>
<p>There was an unusual heavy bombardment this evening which seemed to be coming from the left of the Ypres Salient. The Germans were reported to be very busy erecting gas appliances in their trenches, but evidently our artillery fire was effective as no gas came over.</p>
