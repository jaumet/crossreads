By the time you get this it will be jolly near shearing time I suppose: wool seems to be up well again this year so I suppose we are good for about 20 pence again.It wont be far off the Intermediate either will it Fred suppose you wont have time to write to me anymore you will be so busy studying!!!!Now that the Turk has gone: civilization has come in the shape of a military canteen so we are able to buy all sorts of luck luxuries now until we are shifted out further I suppose.If you are sending a parcel any time please put a tin of ligho "Champion" tobacco in; I  have was given a tin of it from the Red Cross when in Ras-el-tin and it is lovely tobacco and although I don't smoke much I like that little good and you cant buy good stuff here.Did you take any photos in the winter holidays I hope so as I'd love to get some views of home and of Father & Mother; have you sent me photos of them.I am very flash even out here in the desert and when I wear shorts I always put my puttees on upside down just for swank: we only wear shorts in camp and keep our breeches & leggings for when we go out riding.Saw Colin the other day. Did not see Leycester as he was wounded in the first scrap; but they say it is only a "Tourist" wound through the fleshy part of the leg. Must stop now. I forgot to wish you many happy returns HalYour loving brotherRobert C Wilson
