Wednesday 8 Nov. 1916A fine day in general, bright patches of sunshine being most cheering, sandwiched between the driving showers. The cold S wind continues. After breakfast set out with the General during a spell of rain, but did not go past Bn. H.Q. which was fairly heavily shelled while we were there, Bde. H.Q. also receiving some attention during the afternoon.
