<p>Sat. July 20<br/>H.M.A. Hospital ship Wandilla arrived here from England with 540 invalid Australian soldiers. Some very sad &amp; bad cases on board. A day's sail from Gibralter a German submarine appeared on the horizon &amp; fired 3 shots from a 4.7 gun. 1st a few hundred yards ahead, 2nd a few yards astern &amp; the third similar. A signal to stop a distance of 3 miles. The Wandilla stopped.  the sub. signalled them to send a boat off. The Chief officer took charge of the boat &amp; went over &amp; brought over the 2nd in command. He came on board &amp; consulted the Spanish naval officer who is carried on all hospital ships in the Mediterean accordingly to the new agreement between Germany &amp; the Allies. So he inspected the ship throughly &amp; was satisfied the sub on the serface within a few yards of the Wandilla. Photos of her were taken &amp; developed the same we saw</p>
