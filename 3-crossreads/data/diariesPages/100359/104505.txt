The Arab and the Egyptian Women are very graceful when young, especially when seen carrying water they used stone vessels for water, and seem to carry everything on their heads. This afternoon we saw a woman with a baby in her arm and a big stone jar on her head, it was marvellous how she kept it balanced. Pay day 58  P.T. Lost our first man from the 8th. Pty. Ellis C Section, died from Pneumonia at Ismalia.

A Brave band of heroes, armed with sticks (under the command of Sergt. Rumming and Cpl. Fallow) advanced against the fearful (?) odds, and succeeded in quelling what might have easily been a sserious disturbance. Hooray for the 8th.

Another exciting day, Prusst and Fischer, two of our famous S.P. (Sanitary Police) were reported missing since midday yesterday, search party sent out to look for them under Sgt. Jim Marshall. Discovered them near the Railway making their way back to camp. Put under arrest pending an enquiry. Said they got "bushed" and slept in the desert, but that tale doubtful. Nigger died from Yellow Jaundice and was buried in a native burying ground near our camp. Funeral very interesting the body was wrapped in a blanket and was carried on one of our stretchers to the grave in the desert, mourners howling all the way. While some niggers were proceeding with the burial others were chanting prayers. They placed the body in the grave covered it with big stones and cemented them over, then filled in with sand. Then they placed big stones at the head and foot and had another short ceremony, after which they shook hand with each other kissing their hands after each shake, they then returned to work.
