13/8/19 Chemnitz
Spent an hour or two trying cases at Orderly Room. Another rough tempestuous day with everything sliding all over the place. One continual feeling of nausea all day. Some of the men wretchedly sick and have not eaten a bite during the voyage since leaving Durban.
14/8/19 Ship's inspection this morning was one long round of complaints mostly because we asked the troops to eat rabbits this morning. Perfectly good but the complaints are frivolous and come from a minority. Met the Master Chief Steward and OM in conference about the food at 2 pm and the result is that we cannot do any better. I calculate over 200 of my complement are military criminals. A much smoother day today.
