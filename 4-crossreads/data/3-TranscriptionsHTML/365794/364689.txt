<p>Saturday 13 October 1917<br/>Life as usual.  We are sailing due west or practically so.  All lights shut off and no music on acct. of Sister Watson this latter.<br/>Knitting balaclava cap &ndash; grey.  Fit of the "blues" and feeling very down.  Must fight it of course.  Reading nursing book &amp; gaining fair am't knowledge therein.  Sister Gill Warwick helping me by printing my photos but heat - or not sufficient washing - causing them to peel off.<br/>How is it diary that I can always go through life without chasing men?  Very lonely I admit &amp; must miss a lot of fun but still it never seems necessary.</p>
