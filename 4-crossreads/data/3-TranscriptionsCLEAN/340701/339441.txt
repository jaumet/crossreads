Thursday 30-11-16Fritz sent a shell over yesterday & killed an unfortunate German prisoner,  Bad luck.Our Reos [reinforcements] are rather amusing they start chatting [searching for lice] directly they arrive & when they catch one or two, exult considering they are already old Soldiers.  We had a Bath today.  Nos. 1 & 2 Platoons went out to Flers working on dug outs.
Monday 4-12-16Fritz caught an Engineers dug out a couple of days ago & Killed 9 out of 11.  A fine day to day
Wednesday  6-12-16He Blew 4 Tommies to pieces & wounded 7 others in one dug out yesterday.  I won't chronicle any more of these items.  We only get about 9 Hrs day light now.  The Gaurds Brigade only stayed here 4 or 5 days when they came in.  Done one Stunt & Hopped out again.  Lucky Beggars.
