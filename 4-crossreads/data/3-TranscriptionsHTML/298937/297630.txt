<p>Monday 31st July</p>
<p>Saw A.D.M.S. yesterday.  Still expecting to leave tomorrow, but no news has arrived yet.<br/>Harold Clarence came up last night with news that they leave for Salisbury Plain tonight.<br/>Developed some photographs for Nunan last night, including one of two in which I figure.  We are going to print some today.</p>
<p>Marching orders for Tuesday night arrived at 6 p.m.  General excitement.</p>
