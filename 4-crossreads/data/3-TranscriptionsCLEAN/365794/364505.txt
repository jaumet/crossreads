  
 Saturday 13th April 1917 [1918] A "down in the depth of despair" day & yet suppose it is only weakness, however it gradually passes as all days do.  Wrote yesterday to Aunt Min re Uncle Alex's death, Mrs. Richardson, & Mother. Rec'd letter from Sister Hughes & the little thing rises higher than before in my regard for her thought was a kindly one. M.O. (Dr. Spencer) wanders in, discusses fly papers, glances at me, feels pulse, wanders out again.  Order sodii bicarb for cough. Pt. put on ordinary diet!  Had leg of fowl for 4 days previously.
