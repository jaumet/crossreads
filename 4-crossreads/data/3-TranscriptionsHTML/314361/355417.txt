<p>attacking. The 1st Div, attacked this morning, retook the village of Lagnicourt, we were [roused?] out at 7Am to move forward immediately, the 8th &amp; 14th Bde have already gone forward. We had a hurried breakfast, it is 8.30 now but have not yet moved off, expect to any moment.<br/>10.30 We moved off about 9 Am reached a village about one mile away &amp; received orders to about turn, so we are now once again in our old quarters, waiting for the next alarm.<br/>It seems that we retook the village, so there was no occasion for us to move up.<br/>The brigade line was cut, else we would not have moved out all. It is raining again &amp; the ground is very slippery, we would have had a hard walk.<br/>Bapaume April 16th 17<br/>After all we moved out of Le Barque, left about 5pm we are now billeted in Bapaume. Just at the rear of the town are a few hills, from the top of which, I obtained a very fine view of ruined Bapaume &amp; the surrounding country. We then went and had a look at some German prisoners, there are about 500 here just now. Fritz is sending some shells over occasionally. I think he is trying to get at the station, while on the hill he sent over some duds.</p>
