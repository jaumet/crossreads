<p>found invaluable which I have proved by past experience. I started for the Peninsular last May with a full Complement of Signallers and besides that I had 14 Supernumeries I used nearly all my own men and nearly the whole of the 14 men were requisitioned. When I got back to Egypt I only had Wilson Stringer and Inskipp of the original men who went with me to Gallipoli. All the others were either killed, wounded, or sick &ndash; all casualties- Such is war. One xtra man from each Squadron is not much of course but I cannot have more on account of extra duties which will be imposed upon the 2nd Regt as soon as the 1st Regt goes.</p>
