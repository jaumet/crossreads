 which for some absurd reason were witheld from me at Corp . The oper which live will be of great public interest and also spectacular , are to be direct against the Turkish posit Just north of Jerusalem , and also to forc them across the Jordan , leav Jericho in our hand . For this event , which I deem of suffici interest for cinematograph , it was necessari for me to return to Juli for my instrument . The run I found extrem distast , as the distanc is some 40 mile and the road in bad condit . We left Bethlehem at 5 pm and arriv at the A.F.C. Juli at 8 pm . As the weather appear threaten , and I had no desir to be fog in the mud flat of Juli , I decid to return . We arriv at Bethlehem at 12.45 am .
