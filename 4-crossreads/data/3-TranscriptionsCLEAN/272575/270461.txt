  
 if all goes well, I will be able to get a few things over on their side of the world, and send across, "But first I will have to get hold of the cash and second, get into a town where they keep a decent stock, from which it is possible to select something nice..   "In one little place a few days ago. I saw real. hand made Lace advertised, Brussels etc. but as I know very little about the said article, I did not attempt to buy any.  when I have the cash, I shall have to call Sister Nell, or someone else, who can help me. before I commence purchasing those sort of things, I have never heard from Sister N. "bye the way." since she wrote to me when in Blighty   I wrote but never received any answer. so conclude that my Letters never reached her.    now I have a fresh address so am writing to see if I can find her.    I had May. B's address. but lost it, Auntie sent it in a letter she wrote, when I was in Hospital over in Blighty, it was the Heliopolis address but I fancy that May is over here, but in what Hosp. I dont Know.    I have Little more news.
