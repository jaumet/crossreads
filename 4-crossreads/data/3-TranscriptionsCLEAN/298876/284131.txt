Very hot all day - arrived in Colombo 8 am. We were just through the fine breakwaters when we heard the bum boats cry of Di Di Di & Ta-a-ra-ra Boom De Ay - etc - all li all li all li.Dozens of the boats offering pineapples - Bananas., the pines were English variety but of poor size & not nearly the same quality or taste of our own Ripley Queens, the Bananas
