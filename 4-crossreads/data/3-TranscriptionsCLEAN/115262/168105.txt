Tuesday 4 December 1917.
Got to our position at 2 pm 2 am.
Casualties as result of our raid arriving at ambulance. 40 wounded & 2 killed out of 120 Officers N.C.O's & men. Raid not too successful.
Shelled again today. 1 camel killed in our unit. 6 from other units.
Word of being relieved tonight or in early morning. A certain plan adopted to evade suspicion from enemy observation posts. Successful.
At midnight the NZ's relieved us & Jacko apparently knew nothing of this as not a shell was fired.
