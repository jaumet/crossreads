<p>May 2<u><sup>nd</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We stayed in all day &amp; worked on the lorry in the morning - fine warm day - We went down to a shooting range &amp; watched the French Chasseurs shooting &nbsp;they use carbines - they told us they had just come home&nbsp;from Italy -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 3<u><sup>rd</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We greased &amp; cleaned up a bit Frank &amp; I went down on the range with our own rifles &amp; had a shooting competition with some amunition we pinched from the &eacute;chelon. We left Park at 3.P.M. (three lorries) for a Tommy field artillery waggon lines near Glisy. we were detailed to help them move to&nbsp;<s>Ravelcourt</s>&nbsp;<sup>Ravelincourt</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;they did&#39;nt want us in the&nbsp;<s>morning</s>&nbsp;evening so we walked across to the right of Villars Brettenoux&nbsp;<sub>^</sub><sup>near Cachy</sup>&nbsp;where the French Colonial troops were. we watched their 75 mm. guns in action &amp; then walked further to the support trenches &amp; had a yarn with the Algerians. they got us down into the trench as we were too visible to Fritz on top. they made us welcome &amp; exchanged cigarettes being very proud of their native cigarettes which we did&#39;nt care for - We watched the shells of their 75<u><sup>s</sup></u>&nbsp;bursting in Fritzes lines</p>
