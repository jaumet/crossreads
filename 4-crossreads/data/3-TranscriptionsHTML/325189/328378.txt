<p>remainder of the day.  Went to the Nile Barrage.  Train journey 16&frac12; miles 2&frac12; piastres.  Hired a donkey at the Barrage Station &amp; trotted to the dams.  The gardens are very nice here.  There is a Museum of models showing how the Barrage is worked but unfortunately it was closed as it was G.F.  The Nile Delta commences here &amp; across each arm a dam has been constructed.  The arms are very wide.  The difference in the levels was only very small but still a tremendous lot of water was being held</p>
