<p>France<br/>27.4.18</p>
<p>Dear Judge,<br/>I am going like the dickens at present so you must excuse this short note. Its to tell you that the chocolate arrives regularly and is very much appreciated.</p>
<p>I am feeling quite fit but I must admit that the whizz of a shell becomes more distasteful to me each time I hear it. I <strike>seem</strike> am now a permanent sig. officer and it's a very good job too only of course the responsibility is at times pretty rotten.</p>
<p>Love to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; Dorothy &amp; clap K.A.F.on the back for me.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>J. Mant</p>
