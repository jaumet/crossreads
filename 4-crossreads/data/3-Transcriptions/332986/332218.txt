<p>9-8-1917<br/>Vary daring piece of work. An enemy aeroplane, dived on one of our baloons, firing into it with his machine gun, Instantly it caught alight. The men, an officer and a Corporal, jumped out. The men in these baloons are ordered to fasten on the paraschute before going up. A wise pre-caution as proved. The aeroplane that done the damage, had our markings on it; All this happened, almost in our lines. The men landed safely. A few minutes afterwards, our planes attacked and destroyed  5 German baloons. A fine piece of work, to see them, one after the other burst out in flames, and drop to the ground. Gun crews in wagon line again</p>
