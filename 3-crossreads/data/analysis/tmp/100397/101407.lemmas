 When we were come through in The Train , Some English Red Cross Nurs heard that we were come so they wait on the Rli Stn , for 3 hour , we arriv at 11 P.M. and were awaken , by the nurs - at first I did not know what was wrong . Thought we had to detrain , but soon found out that , the Nurs had just wake us up to give us some Chocol and tell us how glad they were to welcom us to Franc . I guess we were glad to see them too , They were the First Ladi we had spoken too sinc leav Perth ? They said they hope some of us would come along to their hospit , when we got wound . Now My Dear Mother I must stop , my hand are allmost too cold to write , Tell Bet that I will write her a letter soon . much Love to all from Your love Son C.G.P.
