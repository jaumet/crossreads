 awhile, then, except for an occasional shot, silence.  A village 2 or 3 miles inland, behind the hills, has been burning all the afternoon, sending thick clouds of smoke up to the sky; when darkness fell, a brilliant reflection was thrown heavenwards.  Along the sea front and up the side of the hill where our men were encamped crowds of camp fires glimmered like stars, presenting a view similar to a large town in the distance; their position is now out of range of shrapnel as all approaches, dominating that part of the hill, have been captured.  Throughout the night the outposts could be heard firing at each other, two different sounds being distinguishable. 
 [Transcriber's notes: Norman Thomas Gilroy, later His Eminence Cardinal Sir Norman Gilroy KBE, Archbishop of Sydney 1940-1971, was born in Glebe, Sydney on 22nd January 1896. He was educated in convent schools and Marist Brothers' Boys' School in Kogarah but left school at 13&frac12; years old to help support his family. He was employed by the Post-Master General's Department (PMG) in the postal service as a telegram messenger, but later began training as a telegrapher, including a period at the Marconi School of Wireless in Sydney. In 1912 he was appointed to country NSW PMG telegraph stations, first in Bourke and later in Narrabri. He was there when World War I started and wished to join up, but his parents objected, however they agreed to him becoming a wireless telegraphy officer on a transport ship. Shortly after his 19th birthday he joined as the junior Wireless Officer on the SS Bulla, formerly the German cargo ship Hessen which had been seized as a Prize at the outbreak of war. He was given leave of absence from the PMG for this purpose. The ship went first to the Middle East carrying troops and horses, was involved in the Gallipoli landing, then to London for refitting, on to Middlesbrough to collect rails for Victoria and back to Australia via Durban, South Africa. It finally arrived in Melbourne in October 1915. 
 In 1915, and for some years later, the only practical technique of distance communication between ships and with land stations was "wireless" telegraphy (later called radiotelegraphy) using Morse code. Radiotelephony was still some years away from becoming a viable system. Vacuum tube (valve) systems were still undeveloped so the transmitters were of the spark-gap type where a high voltage spark initiated oscillations in a tuned circuit connected to the aerial from which the radio wave was transmitted. The spark, and hence the wave transmission, was turned on or off using the Morse key. Although not mentioned by Gilroy, shipboard wireless officers often received the nickname "Sparky". Receivers were relatively simple, in fact being large versions of crystal sets like some of us made in our youth. The Bulla's transmitter operated at a frequency of 500 MHz with a wavelength of 600 metres, as was common for ship-board systems, although few cargo ships at that time were so equipped. The distance over which signals could be sent and received depended on the power of the transmitter and the sensitivity of the receiver. However, it was greatly affected by atmospheric conditions (particularly lightning) and the volume of radio traffic Gilroy mentions a range up to 250 miles for most European stations with the occasional high power station over 800 miles. He manages to read a transmission from Durban when 1000 miles distant. 
 He is friendly and apparently accepted by the majority, if not all of the crew, with whom he has contact. Although clearly of high moral principles and behaviour he shows no leanings towards the priesthood as a career in the early stages of the voyage. Indeed, when Good Friday occurs while in Alexandria, he suddenly realises that the Lenten season had passed without him noticing. However, his interest in Holy Orders may have been stirred by the close friendship he developed with Fr Davidson while in London (Book 3). 
 His diary-type journal was written in pencil and is still generally readable. He did a little editing (probably at the time), by rewriting over the existing text, sometimes after rubbing out the original words. His spelling is generally good, but there are some persistent errors (e.g Canaal for Canal and baloon for balloon). His grammar is usually excellent and his extensive vocabulary is astonishing for a 19 year old who left school at the age of 13. His punctuation does leave something to be desired from a transcriber's viewpoint as commas, full stops, etc. are often not easily distinguished from random marks on the paper. I have therefore been liberal in my interpretation of the marks to ensure clarity of the transcription. Also, although in all but Book 1 he starts each new day's entry on a new line, in Book 1 this sometimes does not happen. For ease of reference I decided to always use the "new line" convention. 
 I feel that this is an important Journal and will be of interest to a wide range of readers. It is relatively large comprising some 50,000 words which reflects the amount of "spare" time that Wireless Officers enjoyed compared with other crew. Also, with few responsibilities while in port, he was able spend much time sight-seeing on shore. He is a keen observer of events and of people and has a surprising depth in insight for someone so young. 
 [Transcriber's notes: This book covers the period from 22nd February 1915 to 29th April 1915 and hence the Gallipoli landing.  It commences with the Bulla (Hessen) in Port Melbourne after refitting in Sydney to accommodate troops and horses for transport to the Middle East.  On this day the troops and horses are loaded and the journey begins.  Once outside Port Phillip Bay, Gilroy become extremely sea sick and barely recovers before reaching their rendezvous off Rottnest Island.  Here they form an unprotected convoy of four transports and sail to Colombo which includes a "crossing the line" ceremony which he describes in detail.  Picking up coal and water, the ship leaves port, now unaccompanied.  The accidental discharge of a firearm leaves an army officer and a Mate wounded but not seriously.  Being alone, the ship is now required to maintain 24 hour radio surveillance.  It travels up the Gulf of Aden, into the Suez Canal and hence to Port Said where refuelling takes place.  No shore leave is granted during this period, but Gilroy gives a detailed description of this journey.  From there the ship enters the Mediterranean and travels to Alexandria where the troops and horses are landed. From March 10th to April 4th the Bulla lay in Alexandria Harbour and Gilroy, together with other officers explored the City and the surrounding countryside.  They also went to Cairo and to the Pyramids, climbing Cheops Pyramid in company with Australian soldiers.  They then visited the Australians at the Mena Camp.  Gilroy shows much sympathy towards the Australian troops and rebuts some of the bad press they had received in Australia.  On April 4th the Bulla took on board a Sikh Mountain Battery, with cannon, mules and feed for the Gallipoli landing.  On April 8th they sail for the harbour at Lemnos Island where they join the large force being assembled for the landing.  On April 24th they moved to a position close to Gallipoli and at 4.30am on April 25th they moved close to the landing beach.  At 8am barges took some of the Mountain Battery which apparently landed safely.  Gilroy gives a detailed account of events from his viewpoint at that time and over the following days.  When shells arrived close to the transports they withdrew to a safer distance, the remaining Sikhs were transported to shore, but not their backup supplies.  On April 28th, acting under instructions, they moved to Gaba Tepe where many of the transports and warship were stationed.  He describes the bombardment of the Turkish positions by the fleet which continues into April 29th when this book concludes.
