<p>Egypt</p>
<p>Cairo</p>
<p>This ancient city to a stranger is a wonderful place, &amp; practically impossible for one to describe things to be seen here.  The population is nearly twice that of London &amp; is said to be the oldest civilized country in the world &amp; no record has yet been found to say how ancient the place is.</p>
<p>The Persians, Greeks &amp; Romans successfully dominated it &amp; these conquering races have now disappeared, whilst Egypt goes on in the same old fashioned way &amp; its people remain.  It was during the Roman occupation that Christianity became a recognised religion &amp; the Copts (descendents of the ancient Egyptians), are said to be the oldest Christian church in existence, yet they are a bad sect, backed up with moneyed men of the city.</p>
<p>The bazaars &amp; streets present a very picturesque picture &amp; one can hear every known language of the world spoken here.  In the streets one comes across hundreds of native cafes, where they go &amp; sit cross legged on high benches &amp; enjoy coffee or a smoke from a long pipe containing "hashish" ( opium) which is supposed to be prohibited from being brought into the country, and very seldom are chairs used, except by the upper classes of Egyptians.  Most of the natives wear a "jlelabieh" (long gown) &amp; a tarbush is always worn on the back of the head: coloured leather shoes, generally carried in</p>
