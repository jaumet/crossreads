Dear old mater,
I've been writing in dribs & drabs since our arrival in England, & haven't sent away a decent letter yet. But this time you are going to get it good & strong.
On Thursday July 20th at about 5.30 pm, we sailed into Plymouth Hoe. Our escort was a battle scarred T.B.D. [Torpedo-Boat Destroyer] with her sides all dented. I don't know what engagement she took part in, but she looks good for quite a deal more yet. It was great to see her slipping through the water between 30 & 40 knots per hour without the slightest effort, & throwing the water back from her bows in two great waves.
The Bay of Biscay is a fraud! So too is the English Channel. We were all looking forward to waves such as we had never seen before, to storms which would drive us miles from our course, to all sorts of danger which would have to be overcome before we could set foot
