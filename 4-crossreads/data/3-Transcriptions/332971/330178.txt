<p>I was uncertain whether we would disembark or go on to Lemnos in the same Troopship- however orders came through on Sat afternoon &amp; we go to the Grand Hotel for the time being.  The Sisters arrived a day earlier than us &amp; were scattered about in different Hospitals working.  The Officers &amp; men have gone on to Lemnos to prepare.  How tired under present circumstances we are of travelling.  We are being termed the 6/- bob a day tourists.  Any way we hope to be ready to receive from the big engagement about to take place in the Dardanelles.  Sunday I went to St. Marks in the am a pretty English Church &amp; in the evening to the Presbyterian &amp; there it was a touching sight to see the Church packed with khaki, with the exception of a few ladies.  I thought how pleased the Mothers would be to know that their boys attended Church &amp; the majority of them stayed to communion.  The more one goes about the more one realises how terrible this war is.  <strike>over</strike>  Tomorrow morning we start for Lemnos &ndash; a 48 hours journey- we are more than thankful.  The 30 Sisters have been recalled in.</p>
<p>August 9th<br/>Now I am wondering how I can best explain the next piece of news- and have decided not to go into the why &amp; wherefore of it- only say that I am being left behind at Alexandria for about 2 months and then rejoin them.  Whilst here I will be working at the Deaconesses Hospital otherwise No. 19 [indecipherable] &ndash; a beautiful building taken over from the Management of Germans</p>
