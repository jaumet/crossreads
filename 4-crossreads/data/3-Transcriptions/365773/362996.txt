<p>&amp;is doing his best to get back home, I wrote to the address the Red Cross gave me &amp; the chap he was staying with wrote back to say he had gone away leaving no address &amp; said he was O.K. I hope you have further news of him yourself.<br/>I am at present waiting for a boat to go home - expect to get away early this month - this big strike is holding up the boats a lot - I will wire you from W.A. when I reach there.<br/>With heaps of love to all at 'Las Palmas' &amp; hoping to see you soon.<br/>Your loving brother</p>
