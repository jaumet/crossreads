bombs, minnewerfers and pine apples mostly and just a couple      of guns.
Sept 17th Monday.
The night before last about 60 men from the 56th Bn raided the hun's trenches after a short but furious bombardment from our mortars and guns. When they reached the trenches they found them empty with the exception of a few curios they brought nothing back. The other Bde raiders were more fortunate and were able to bring back some prisoners. The Scotties also had a successful raid. We worry the hun all the time and get no retaliation except a few minnewerfers and pineapple bombs. Our telephone lines are in good order just now but a Ninny made a mess of them last night.
