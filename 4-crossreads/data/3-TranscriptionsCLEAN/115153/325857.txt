  
 comfortably and went to sleep, when in half an hour or thereabouts, we were wakened by the Sergeant Major and ordered to fall in ready to move up to the line. We were rather surprised at being called out, but of course, we dared not ask the question why, and if we did we would not be told.  We soon got in readiness in the dark, as we were forbidden to light matches, and trudged up to the front line in file. When we were halfway on the road in, we were given extra supplies of cartridges and bombs. When this was done, we had a fair idea that we were badly wanted in the front line, and all the time we were being served with ammunition we were shelled by the enemy, but as good fortune saved us, no one was hit. 
 We arrived in the front line at about 3o'clock in the morning, and were shown to our dugouts.  The dugout in which I was accommodated held over 100 men, and it had two entrances which were stairways going down into the ground 40 or 50 feet deep. 
 A raiding party of our Battalion had already been over the top for the purpose of giving "Fritz" a shake up, when they discovered that he had departed in a hurry, and left lots of his kit and ammunition behind. On learning this, they immediately manned the trench, and sent word back to our headquarters that the enemy had retreated and that it would be wise to follow him up until he offered resistance. Being a Signaller, I was engaged in helping to run a wire out from headquarters to the new trench we had manned. 
 In the morning when daylight came we walked in the open, above the trenches under the cover of a heavy fog, but when the fog began to clear away we realised we were in an open position, which was proved by the fact that a few men got shot dead by a few snipers who had hidden themselves in the hill forest opposite us. For the rest of the day we kept low in the trenches and the enemy aeroplanes kept swooping past and machine gunning us, after which we were bombarded severely and continuously. The bombardment was so intense that we were confined to our dugout for nearly two days without seeing daylight. There we sat in the bottom of a 40 feet deep dugout, listening to the shells pummelling at the surface of the earth above, sometimes sitting in darkness for hours, and occasionally lighting a butt of a candle so that we might play a game of cards.
