  
 in the morning, you will be well on in your day's work. 
 Nov 23 On duty as Quartermaster's assistant for today from 7-9AM. 1-3 & 7-9  P.M, which means practically that I am to do nothing. For, while on duty I have merely to sit on a box in the corner & keep a tally of the sporting material etc used by the Company & besides I have four hours off between each shift during which time I can read & write. And so here I sit on my box, munching ginger-nuts and half-asleep. I read a number of poems by Mrs Browning this morning - most of which are really excellent, especially that one entitled "He giveth his beloved sleep"
