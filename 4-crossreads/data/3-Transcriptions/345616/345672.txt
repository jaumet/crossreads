<p>Tuesday 24/12/18<br/>up at 6a.m. white frost, moon shining also stars. BK at 7. fell in 8.30 &amp; off to here 7 Kilos to Rance A much better town than last &amp; much cleaner was a Hun Head Qrs once &amp; plenty of women.  Sun shining quite hot what a change &amp; altho/ I carried my full Pack etc did it easily in 1 &frac12; hours. feel very fit ground hard as iron, This Place has streets all cobbled  all the People turned out to meet us. At the last place Sivry the huns burned down 80 houses &amp; the church took the first 16 civis they came across &amp; put them up against the wall &amp; shot them this was to put Terror into them. otherwise they left them alone  &amp; if the women took the soldiers on well that was their look out. A Tommy was  shot in the street at 5 minutes to 11 on the 11th Nov Armistice day stiff luck. Am finding out that half &amp; more of the women who took on germans took them voluntarily. Tomorrow Xmas day cant realize it, last Year it was all snow &amp; freezing today quite hot &amp; we were about 200 miles south of here. &#163;66-15-6 &#163; 4-15-10 must write some letters to day if I get a chance but not to Nell give her time to think it over, every letter whining to get to Hobart.</p>
