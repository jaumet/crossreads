  
 Dear Jack 
 Only this morning I saw & heard the 2 nd  Bn. They were marching beautifully. My Adjutant was with me & I at once gave him orders to get a list of all men able to play band instruments & also any drummers. (The 2 nd  Bn also had a side drum band for marching). The idea of getting the names was to get going with a Band at once. I really think it necessary: I may not get a good band but it surely will help the marching.
