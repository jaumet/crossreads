Sunday 25thThe extent of the advance towards Cambrai so far is that the Hindenburg line has been breached and our troops have advanced to a depth of 6 miles on a 12 mile front. About 200 tanks went over without any artillery preparation and the infantry & Cavalry poured in through the breach The Germans were completely taken by surprise We have taken about 10,000 prisoners & 100 guns & the fighting continues, very desperately I had a service this morning with the 2nd Battalion It was bitterly cold & not at all pleasant A keen strong wind is blowing
