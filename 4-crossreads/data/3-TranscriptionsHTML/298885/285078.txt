<p>Tues July 11th &ndash; 16<br/>At last the rain has decided to have a spell and at last we made a move at 8PM for Bailleul Station which we reached at 9.45PM and after loading guns and limbers we left at 1 AM.</p>
<p>Wed July 12th &ndash; 16<br/>After a sleepless and cold journey we arrived at Candas at 7.45AM then proceeded to Flixencourt a distance of 20 miles. It was very tiring and monotonous riding behind the column on a bike at a slow pace. Here we are still a fair distance behind the line whence the offensive began a few days ago on the Somme</p>
