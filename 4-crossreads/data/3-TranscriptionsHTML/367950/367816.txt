<p>Tea at 5 pm Everyday something different; always a change of diet. The ship is a regular home and I for one am thoroughly satisfied. Lights are switched off at 10 and then some argument crops; up and must be discussed we don't seem to have had time enough during the day but must wait till the lights go out &ndash; sleep time in fact. I am as bad as the rest but I mention what really does happen.<br/>Next morning at about 6 oclock some one who was disturbed last night by us arguing wakes us all up by saying "Six oclock all you noisy people, now is the time for that argument, now let us hear all about it not after lights out"!<br/><u>Not a word</u> !<br/>Sergeant Fallick is the leader, he is a veritable mine of knowledge on things political, he is a modern Demosthenes and he generally picks on me as his opponent I am always quiet until then but then the fun starts and goodness knows when it is likely to end. Fallick walks</p>
