 6d per lb,  bananas were sold to night through the canteen at 4d per dozen, I speculated 1/6 on them & had a very enjoyable feed. 
 Thurs 19th Had a good night's rest last night, & there was no rain for a wonder, rose at 5 AM. & had a cup of tea; by the way, when we buy tea it is from the Saloon galley & very good, quite a change from the rubbish we get, we pay 6d for a cup of tea & a scone & it is worth it; 
 yesterday we sighted land which I believe is a small island at the south of India, but we were not close to it.  Thomlinson & Pope have been transferred to the signallers, in place of Fitzgerald & Oakes.  Nobody seems very distressed through Oakes leaving us.  The Minitor
