<p>Dear Arthur</p>
<p>Will you post the enclosed to Ferguson Judge.</p>
<p>Just prior to leaving Durban the Firemen who had looked upon the wine when it was red, did some funny business on the Wharf, &amp; got into holts with the South African Police.</p>
<p>The S.A.P. were not big chaps but perfect artists at their job &ndash; &amp; they finished the affair in no time.</p>
<p>I wish you had been there &ndash; you would have thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
<p>[The above written by C. M. to which Arthur D Fisher added a footnote]</p>
<p>The above will explain the enclosure which I also duly received &amp; hasten to send along.</p>
