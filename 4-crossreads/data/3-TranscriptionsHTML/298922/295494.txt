<p>Wednesday 27 June 1917</p>
<p>Our planes bombed some came down over Bedouin country among them the BUS I had a ride in. <strike>The Bedouins burnt them before they could be reclaimed but</strike>  The Aviators rode home on the tails of the other planes.</p>
<p>Just got news we move on Friday. This has been Paradise &amp; marks another milestone along the weary trail of war. Each move one &amp; all look for the end. The sea has done us all much good &amp; we have been CLEAN.</p>
