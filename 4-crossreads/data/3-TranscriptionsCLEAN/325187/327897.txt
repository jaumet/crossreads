No BombsWe are getting fresh frozen Australian mutton now, but packed on a Camel, in the sun & very often a Camel with skin disease does not make it more enticing, but a change from Bully.The YMCA is still with us a great institution but their Tent is a rather good sighter for aeroplanes.Being near the sea, everything steel rusts & the sand knocks the devil out of Razors etc:-40 Horses still missing but of 1st Regiment.Will post this with love, How the weeks go bye-
