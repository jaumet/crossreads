  
 An "indigation"  meeting was held on deck last night & a resolution passed after a lot of talking, to the effect that the Padre, should send a protest to the Returned Soldiers Association against our unfair treatment & etc & to ask them to take action in the matter & get tings sifted out, also a letter was to be sent to both the "Age" & "Argus" stating our case quite plainly, officers & all are concerned in this matter.
