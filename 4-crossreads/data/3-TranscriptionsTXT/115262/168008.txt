Wednesday 29 August 1917.
Very little doing today.
3 Taubes shelled in vicinity of Sheikh Nuran.
Heard mail closed today or rather last night; & from all reports all letters written between 6th June & 22nd July never reached Australia therefore up to this date in Austlia they have have received no word by letter of our arrival.
Anxiously awaiting our mail which we cannot get until relieved.
Living in hopes that those mails were not lost at sea. General disheartening regarding this.
