<p>Last Thursday, Corpus Christie Day, the allies by request did not bomb Cologne or the German towns but the enemy shelled French churches &amp; on Friday they again bombed hospitals, to show how much they had been touched by granting their request.</p>
<p>Wednesday June 5.1918. 1401.<br/>A fine morning. I was on 1st picquet last night the night was cold &amp; I had a sore eye &amp; the cold made it worse.</p>
<p>A squadron of enemy planes came over. Innumerable search lights were up  &amp; the archies &amp; machine guns drove off the enemy.</p>
<p>It is reported that Dave McKean was killed within the first day or two, with several others. He was a machine gunner &amp; came from Merrigum . The report is not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>In the big fight in the Reims sector the Germans have been forced to slow down. The enemy brought up fresh troops between the Oise and Ourcq &amp; attacked with great violence. which  are held in check by french counter attacks. Today I received the "Weekly Times" of Jan 12 &amp; 4 copies of the "age" from my sister.</p>
<p>Thursday June 6. 1918. 1402<br/>A fine day but there is a cold wind bowing this evening.

<p>Friday June 7. 1918. 1403<br/>A fine day but rather close &amp; cloudy.</p>
