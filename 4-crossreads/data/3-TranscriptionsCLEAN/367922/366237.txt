 Dear Mr. Fry, Allow me to thank you very much for Mr. Edmonds sermon you so kindly sent us, I cannot tell you how much we value the sermon & the kindly sympathy which prompted you to let us have - now we can go to it for refreshment & strength which it all contains, but for you it would have been more or less lost to us - 
 We send our Sympathetic Greetings to dear Mrs. Fry yourself & family looking forward with Hope for the future 
 Mrs Cuthbert bids me say the sermon you were so good to send her will remain a valued possession words fail me to properly describe our feelings for your thoughtful service 
 With our deep regards to Mrs Fry, yourself & family 
 Believe me Yours Most Sincerely [indecipherable] Cuthbert
