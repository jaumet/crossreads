<p>January 1916<br/>Took lunch with us &amp; went on out to the Barrage, 20 miles from Cairo where we lunched &amp; wandered round the gardens, which are very extensive &amp; beautiful.  The Nile River flows through here it is the River is locked by huge gates which are opened in time of flood.  Over lunch we drove back to Cairo &amp; went out to a hospital at Ghezireh to see a cousin of Jim Suffolks.  We spoke to some very nice nurses &amp; would have liked to have taken a couple of them out for a drive.  We had a look at the Zoological Gardens.  They are well kept &amp; have a splendid collection of animals.  We had tea at York House &amp; afterwards met several acquaintances.  At 9.30 pm we left Cairo &amp; got back to camp at 10 pm.</p>
