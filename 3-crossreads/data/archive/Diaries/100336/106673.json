August 3rd we again have rumours that there is to be no more work.  In the afternoon we watch some strange dancing by the Turkish Recruits.  Our beds arrive but are not served out.  The following day they give us our beds, a small mattress filled with grass.  We feel the benefit after lying on the hard floor.  The night of August 5th was very exciting.  We had all turned in and most of us asleep when we heard the music of a band approaching and at intervals great cheering.  They came close until they had surrounded our buildings.
