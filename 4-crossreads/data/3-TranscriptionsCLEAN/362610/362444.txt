  
 Wednesday 16 August 1916 Again showery. During the morning moved up to Bde. H.Q. in Sausage Valley. As we walked up along the Bapaume Rd., branching off at Ovilliers we were surprised at the amount of work that had been put in since we left, the place being cleaned up, a new road made, & great improvements effected. The way in which the guns, both field & heavy, had been moved forward was very noticeable. The travelling kitchens, too, were now taken right up to Ovilliers. Our H.Q. were in a deep dug-out in which there was not overmuch room for us all, but quite safe. Meals were taken up on top in a small screened off enclosure.
