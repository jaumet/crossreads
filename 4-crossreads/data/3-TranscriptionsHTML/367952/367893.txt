<p>Dear Auntie Beat</p>
<p>Just got copy of the cable. It was addressed to Canon Wright so owing to rules and regulations of the Post Office I could not get an official copy. But these are the exact words of the cablegram.</p>
<p>"Canon Wright Merewether<br/>Officially reported Private Thrityseven Seventy (3770) Thomas Bell killed in Action, Please inform wife in Edwards St Merewether"</p>
<p>(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[indecipherable]</p>
