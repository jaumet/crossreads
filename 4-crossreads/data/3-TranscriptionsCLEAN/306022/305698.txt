  
 Monday 2nd Got our first war news from Mauritius, which is cheering us up a bit. The British are still doing well. 
 Saw more flying fish. 
 Tuesday 3rd The usual dreary day's doings, though livened up a bit in the afternoon by some good boxing events, our fellows all doing well. 
 Wednesday 4th Boat going along very steadily. Water just like glass though a nasty sort of day.
