<p>if friends don't call to see her. Sorry the Thomas's are so delicate. They must be very tired of sickness. Miss Stirling writes such nice letters to the boys &amp; they do enjoy them, so do I. Glad to hear you have been out to see Charity &amp; that her garden is coming on so well. I wonder if Vi is better I had a letter from Mrs McCallum telling of her poor old mother's death and that Vi had measles. Hope you will all have a Happy Xmas &amp; that you get your Xmas present from me, you will know what is best for dear little Eddy and his birthday will soon be here &amp; he will be six years of age, how the time flies. Wish I could see the pet. I had such a nice long letter from Mother peel, it is lovely to think one is not quite forgotten. Charlie sent his photo in a letter to me, taken by Marion &amp; it is such a good one, he looks very happy &amp; well. Dear old</p>
