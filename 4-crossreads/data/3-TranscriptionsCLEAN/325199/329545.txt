 This afternoon several boxing contests were on. But the event of the evening was a contest of 6 rounds of 2 minutes each for a purse of 30 between Moles  and  of A. company and Weeks of the Army service. Weeks received a lot of punishment but won on a foul in the third round. Moles lost his nut and hit him when down on his knees. Weeks was cool and collected throughout, and probably would have won had the 6 rounds been fought. Moles appeared to be excited and winded, and received but stood a lot of punishment. Weeks is an old boxer with a lot of science. Moles is a blacksmith from Maffra. Hughie Magin was referee.
