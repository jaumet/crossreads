  
 sleep in a few minutes. 11th. Breakfast at 9.30 this morning & quite early enough after the stiff time of the last 24 hours. This morning is very dull & cloudy hope it don't rain, we are not so very far from Amiens here according to the map. The country we are now in is mostly chalk & very picturesque, it is fairly hilly & well wooded, while the roads are the best I have seen in France Have just been round the village Dombart she is rather a nice little place & very pretty  I don't think they have ever seen Australians before, for we attract a fair bit of attention, I notice the officers are having a job to get quarters for they are running about all over the place, & I notice our Brigadier is on the same job, our boy's are already making the old village
