<p>October, 1915<br/>Tuesday 26<br/>Re-organized Regiment &amp; with 85 men brought over have formed B Squadron X <strike>I am given my Captaincy at last</strike>X Usual bombing &amp; Howitzer shelling going on day &amp; night but we are fairly comfortable here at No. 2 outpost - &amp; the scenery!!! Is very fine, Imbros island about 15 miles on our West &amp; Hospital Ships, Torpedoe boats, trawlers lie in between or unload quietly <strike>at night &amp; steal away before being shelled in the morning - </strike> We have a lovely view of the shell fire &amp; the burst of shrapnel mixing with the clouds as the Turks fire at our Aeroplanes.</p>
