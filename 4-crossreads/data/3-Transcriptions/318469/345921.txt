<p>19th<br/>Enemy opened early with an attack on our Front &amp; heavy shrapnel fire.  Also did some damage to our trenches with 4.7" during the day.  I was revetting trenches &amp; placing travases with party Infantry.  During the afternoon the shelling by the Enemy with 4.7" of our trenches was heavy.  The part where I was working having 6 shells within 60' doing a good deal of damage blowing an overhead cover I was engaged on.  I was about 10' away at the time &amp; we had to abandon the work for the time being.  During the attack in the early hours of the morning it is estimated that the Enemy had about 1500 killed while our losses were about 12 per Battalion.</p>
