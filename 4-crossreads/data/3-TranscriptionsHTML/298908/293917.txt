<p>12th.  A heavy gale of wind sprang up last night &amp; this morning the old tub is rocking unmercifully &amp; my poor head is spinning like a top it would not want too much more to send me rushing upstairs &amp; to hang over the rails &amp; let my breakfast go for the benefit of the fishes.  I am satisfied that I am no sailor.  I nearly got wet through this morning a big wave came rushing up &amp; broke with a crash right over our ship luckily I saw her coming &amp; ducked behind cover just in time to miss the father of a ducking which a few more not so <strike>unfo</strike> fortunate as myself received, what ducks they looked when they recovered their breath &amp; beat it for safety &amp; a change.</p>
<p>13th.  Yesterday was a good illustration of how sky affects the color of the sea, the day was cloudy &amp; little squalls kept on coming</p>
