October 1915
Sunday 3
Light duty today for a change.
Got some firewood from the hill during day & did little else except write some letters & read "Vanity Fair".
Heard that the firing on the left a couple of days ago resulted in 1000 yds gain.
Three hospital ships in the bay & several visits from our aeroplanes overhead.
