<p>7 &ndash; patients &ndash; for I have some things to say. But darling Mother don't let any one repeat my sayings. I don't mind you giving them to people to read who are really interested though I only scrawl away for you &amp; Dad &amp; the family and often I am afraid say imprudent things &ndash; you terrify me when you say something about printing a bit of my letter &ndash; if you do such a thing &ndash; please don't say I wrote it or that I'm a nursing sister or else my letters &amp; others will all be severely censored.<br/>All the news you give me about the family is so interesting to me and the letters you enclose. I will write more tomorrow &ndash; but will close this as it is.<br/>Dearest love to you and Father and Bill. Con's letters are so refreshing. I sometimes feel all our letters "your family" is a bit like a family I read about once as a small girl in a book written by a Jewish woman &ndash; I can't remember the name of the book or writer &ndash; But it was about a family like any of varying ages &amp; careers.<br/>I heard from Roslyn today and Helen Stewart. I loved their letters. I'll answer them. Love to Edith. Hope she is fit. Your loving daughter<br/>Betha McMillan</p>
