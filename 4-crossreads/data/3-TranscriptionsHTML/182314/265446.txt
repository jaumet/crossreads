<p>27<sup>th </sup>July 1915</p>
<p>To The O.C. &quot;C&quot; Coy</p>
<p>from Captain [P.J. Murphy?]</p>
<p><u>Report on N.C.O.&#39;s of No 12 platoon.</u></p>
<p>Sir.</p>
<p>In accordance with your instructions and acting in consultation with Platoon Serg<sup>t.</sup> Norris, in the absence of L<sup>t. </sup>Shaw, I beg to submit my report on the N.C.O.s of No 12 platoon</p>
<p>X <u>Platoon Serg<sup>t.</sup> Norris</u></p>
<p>An ideal platoon sergeant. Perfect control, smart &amp; reliable always. In any ticklish job, I would recommend him in the certainty that it would be carried out as well as any N.C.O. could do it.</p>
<p>X <u>Sgt M<sup>c.</sup>Clure</u></p>
<p>A good reliable man. Lacks dash and initiative. If <s>asked</s> told to carry out a job requires too many particulars, as to how it should be done. Health not too good, would never recommend him to act as platoon Sergt.</p>
