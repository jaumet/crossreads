<p>At Sea<br/>12.3.18</p>
<p>Dear Judge<br/>I hope to get this letter posted before we finally get away from Australia though I cannot be sure of getting it off. However I suppose it will reach you sometime even if it doesn't go then.</p>
<p>We have had a pretty good run so far until this evening. It has been a very slow trip as you will see by the date. We have been right out of the usual track of ships and had an empty sea from the time we left Melbourne until late this afternoon when a coastal boat passed us going south. It is now blowing pretty hard from behind us and the boat is rolling rather suddenly at times. She seems to be a bit top heavy from the way she tips about.</p>
<p>We are faring pretty well in the Sergeants mess and keeping pretty fit by doing long walks round the decks whenever we can find a space clear of troops. We are also getting a course of lectures on aviation subjects by a Flight sub lieutenant R.N.A.S. who is returning to England. He was in the first Richmond school and offered his services to us.</p>
<p>Must stop now and go to bed. Give my love to Dorothy &amp; Mrs Ferguson</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>George M Edwards</p>
