The loads are attached by a long rope & first by doubling    the length then half the  & throwing the loop over the saddle to the further side half the load is then caught by drawing the loose ends around the load & threading them thro other loop, the other side is then fixed in a similar manner, the whole being secured by a  sursingle.
