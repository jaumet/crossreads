<p>[Handwritten note]</p>
<p>I was at a vaudeville entertainment t&#39;other night which had this as its second half. &nbsp;It was the first entertainment of any sort (except a few concerts) I&#39;ve been at since I left Home.</p>
<p>The big town where this programme is performed nightly is often reminded of Fritz&#39;s proximity and its state at different parts show how well he keeps track of it.</p>
