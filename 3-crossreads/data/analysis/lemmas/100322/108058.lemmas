 30/4/19 Wiesbaden Rose at 6.30 a.m. with the intent of catch an 8 a.m. train here and go up to Konigswint in order to climb the Drachenfel and then go on from there to Cologn later in the day . After dress a glanc out of the window show light snow and a littl rain fall . Had breakfast and then decid to go into Mayenc and catch the 9.17 rapid for Cologn . A pleasant walk up from the Pont Princip to the Station . The whole place is laid out in garden and there is a fine big church which seem to be a Prot . The German policemen wear cloak and sword and appear a smart militari lot of chap . Arrive in good time at Mainz station and got a good seat in the train . The sun now came out and I regret not go to Konigswint as at first intend . Had a good trip
