<p>20th September 1918</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>The mail is closing this evening and it may be some days before we are able to post letters again, so I&#39;ll write a short note now, to do intstead of my ordinary weekly letter. There have been pretty big things doing round on our left the last couple of days. I wonder if you have been able to follow the places on the map I sent you when you read the cables. So far we have only pulled down our bivvies and packed our saddles and just stood by, but I think we&#39;ll soon be starting to follow on. Bill West has just gone to hospital with a septic throat I think. It is rather hard luck for him as he has been recommended to go to the 6 months course at the cadet school and was to leave before the end of the month. I suppose he will miss the schools for a couple of months now but I&#39;m jolly glad he got the recomendation</p>
