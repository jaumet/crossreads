have always feared the German weight, meaning thereby their numbers and education in the science and art of war.   Bad luck for the youngster with the perkins boys, they are savage enough for anything, I fear me that they may follow in the footsteps of their uncles.   Let us hope not, but the older they grew the more intollerably impudent they became.   Fine specimens physically they were mentally spoiled.   Have heard nothing from Dr Harris for a long time.  If he be at Lemnos I may meet him on my wanderings.  One does not know his luck these days.  Did not know that Reg Power is married.   Good luck to him.  Where does he live?
Your second letter dear.  It is the special sheet I note.  You will have answer on another sheet.
Kitty dear/ Midst the gaities of Cessnock you had not much time for letter writing.   Mrs and Dr. Fisher were very good to you I shall write to him some day.  The progress of the mining area around Cessnock has been remarkable, and if the population of Australia were to increase rapidly the progress would be much more marked, however the portions of the coal field that is not being worked now is being saved for posterity. You will know the whole country side by time you returned to Sydney.  A trip into the country is health giving to you city folk, and the part you have been in has always been for natural soil and folliage hard to beat, when I knew it first it was a small place where only some orchards and farms had residents.  Puch [Much] changed this last ten years. Glad to read that you play tennis because it means that your arm is in better state than of yore.   Good.   Good.   Very up to date machinery has been place in the mines of the Maitland coal fields.  Of the best.
Poland and Belgium have been the battle ground for many warring nations adown the centuries.   Caesar wrote about the Belgae two thousand years agone, they were a warlike people then.
My best wishes and regards to Dr and Mrs Fisher.   Also to Mr Pearce if you have chance to deliver them.  Well and as happy as can be under the circumstances.  Hurrah.   Hurrah.
During the week I shall put together some sentences for you, which will form the nucleus for another letter.   Meanwhile good bye My dears, may fortune of the best be with each of you now and always.  Heaps of love and loads of kisses from, your loving and affectionate father
