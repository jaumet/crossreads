  
 there wasn't any from Sydney. Things seem very quiet this way now. Only one plane over last night. 
 Wednesday 21.8.18. Had inspection & packed kits ready to move. We move to Hamel at 6pm. Relieve the 1st Pioneers of their billets. Looks as if the Divvy is going to rest for a couple of days. Wrote 3 letters & read all the morning & afternoon while waiting for the move. 
 Very foggy this morning. Left our camp at 6pm & came to Vaux sur Somme passing through Hamel & Vaire sous Corbie. Gee Hamel is knocked about some. Almost as bad as Warfusee. We are camped in a billet. Stone floor with windows as doors. The men are near a canal & are under trench shelters. Lovely moonlight night. We took over from the 3rd Battalion. All the 1st Div
