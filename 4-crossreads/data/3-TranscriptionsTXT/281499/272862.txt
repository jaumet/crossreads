a good chance of going to Blighty"It was one of the most wearisome marches as ever I have been on, for we held up every few hundred yards by the heavy traffic.At last we got on to the "Bazentin Road which carried us nearly to "Delville Wood" the place which cost so many men & of all the sloppy dirty walks as ever I have been on well this one takes the bun, it was neither mud nor water but it was about the same thickness as cream, & as we went along we got covered with white mud from head to foot, talk about a mess we were in you would scarcely have known us, especially some of the boys who came "gutsers" & fell in the rotten stuff, well we reached our destination at last just back
