<p>work in safety.  On the beaches around it there are built very strong trenches &amp; barbed wire entanglements.  It is reckoned to be the most strongly fortified place in the world &amp; it certainly looks it.  There are sentries everywhere &amp; extreme caution is taken to see that no one gains any knowledge of the inside workings, except very responsible Officials.  There is a neutral line drawn up between it &amp; Spain &amp; no British are allowed across that, or they would become liable to be interred whilst war is on.  Nearly all of the workmen are Spaniards &amp; everything is conducted by British Officers &amp; Clerks.  Nothing whatever can leave Gibraltar without an order from the Admiralty.  The water supply is mostly obtained from Morocco, on the opposite coast, but concrete water catches have been built &amp; these run the rainfall into large tanks.  Everybody speaks English &amp; English money is used.  Destroyers &amp; Cruisers are cruising about in the straits &amp; on every peak a gun is mounted.  So nobody has much chance of gaining an entrance to the Meditteranean.  Having taken in coal we left at 4.30 p.m. for London.</p>
<p>July 1st 9.a.m.  Got a message from a Japanese Maru boat by wireless to say that she came across a ship being sunk by a submarine &amp; turned &amp; made off &amp; that the submarine chased them for an hour &amp; then gave up as it could not catch them.  The position given was Lat 49&deg;N Long 6&deg;W. that is 48 miles North West of Ushant.  We will be there at 1 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
<p>3 p.m.  The Captain has changed our course &amp; insted of passing 25 miles off Ushant will go in to within 5 miles of it.</p>
