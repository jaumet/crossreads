  
 On the S/S "Douglas" 14/5/18 
 Dear Dad, Mum & George, 
 I am sitting watching Douglas & the beautiful Isle of Man fade away in the distance.  It is so sad to leave such a lovely place especially when the dearest Aunt & Cousin in the whole world are to left behind also.  But life is made up of sad partings & we have to be brave.  It makes us long for Home so much when we feel this way.  It revives & we live again the partings from loved ones in Australia.  But enough of sad regrets.  We live from day to day.  One is much like another.  I can see the Cumberland Hills & the Welsh Hills if I look for'ard.  The air is very clear & the sea is like glass.  I had better start from Bulford on my Holiday trip & give you all details.  I set out on Wednesday last at 8 a.m.  I arrived in London at noon.  I had dinner at Marylebone Station & went out to Harefield as escort for two Patients.  I returned to London & went straight up to D.J's.  I saw Devereaux & Mr. C.L. & had a chat with both.  I looked over the old Photo of the Picnic where I ran that funny old mile race.  Oh the funny guys we all look especially George who resembles a German Professor
