<p>Sunday Aug 4. 1918. 1461.<br/>4 years of the war has gone by and today is the commencement of the 5th year of  Britain's entry to the war. A big push and advance is expected at any time to celebrate the event &amp; to remind the enemy that war does not pay. All along the lines on the Western front the allies have had a succession of victories &amp; it is believed that greater successes are about to take place any day now.<br/>This morning I posted to my wife a German cartridge pouch from their equipment. It is made of leather. It contains some empty cartridge cases and some German equipment buttons.<br/>American troops are taking over this camp &amp; large numbers of soldiers were billeted in the trenches around here &amp; their cookers &amp; limbers came into the wood tonight.<br/>The papers are full of good news every day but it is difficult to get one now. I received two copies of the Southern Cross this evening. Although it was Sunday we did not get a holiday owing to the pressure of work &amp; in the view of us moving at any time I was obliged to make a number of match box covers this evening in order to get rid of them.</p>
