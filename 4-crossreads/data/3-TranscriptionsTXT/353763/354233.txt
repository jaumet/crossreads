at 6 am to-day we were up  -  We got into 2 lines & the ships now keep station & we are steaming full speed for Suva - 8 of us - in our original order - with AE2 & the Destroyers on our Starboard Beam  -  It's a smooth sea  -  I was vilely seasick all Monday  -  She did pitch horribly & knocked me clean out  -  Tuesday was better & to-day I'm all right again  -  Dont go to sea in small boats is my tip  -  We could see the Destroyers go right into it & AE2 used to dip right up to her conning tower  -  All is well on board & whatever happens we cant go back to Ribaul  -  I just saw the island Bougainville yesty = aftn= but no more land so far  -  Ribaul  is  4 S of the line & Suva is 18S so we've some way to travel - 1800 miles  -
I am reading early history  -  The earliest sailors crept along the shore  -  It is an historical fact that it took 75 days to go from Egypt along the Libyan shore thro the Gates of Hercules (Gibralter) to Gades (Cadiz)  -  The 1st circumnavigation of Africa - (600BC) was accomplished by a Phoenician ship - in 3 years
