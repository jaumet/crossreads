My dearest Mother,
I have joined this Club   &  it is very cosy. Nice   &  quiet also warm. It is just a nice walk from our Hospital   &  if I am to be here for the winter months will find it very convenient. Our room in Hosp. is very popular so get very little time for writing. To-day is my day-off (the first for three weeks) so stayed in bed this morning   &  had a lovely rest, got up   &  dressed ready to go out for 1 o'clock dinner. Sister Kelly is off-duty this afternoon, so she hurried up    &  dressed, then we walked quickly here, in the beautiful sunshine - it was very frosty the morning   &  awfully cold. Faancy I have a chilblain on my letter finger of L. hand   &  3 on my toes, so you
