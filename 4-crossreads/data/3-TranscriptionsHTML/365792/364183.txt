<p>Apl 12 sort of chap this Walker. The Huns sent a rather impolite message to the 2nd Div', so s'pose they'll be presenting us with a similar one. Drunk 3 glasses of milk yesty (at 1 per glass) &amp; 3 more this m'ng. Even the children drink the beer in this country &amp; they thrive on it too<br/>A Taube dropped a few bombs close by, &amp; burnt 2 laundry sheds.<br/>Hope they don't take a liking to our barn. This district is full of spies', men, women &amp; children, &amp; one cannot trust any of them. Sergt has been telling us about the trenches we are to occupy shortly, &amp; it seems to me that the Huns have the Tommies bluffed. Its up to us to bluff Mr Hun &amp; show him a few points.
