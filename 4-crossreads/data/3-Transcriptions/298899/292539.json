<p>pictures &amp; relics of the invaded citys, such as Verdun etc. We then proceeded over the Seine by the Pont de Alexandre III into the Esplanade des Invalides, a large open space. Splendid gold figures surmounted the four columns on the bridge. Youngsters were roller skating on the concrete places &amp; a large concourse of people were trekking in the one direction to the Hotel des Invalides built 1671 &amp; restored by Napoleon I &amp; III. The building provides a home for wounded and aged soldiers, originally for 6000 soldiers but now a few hundred. The courtyard contained trophies captured from the enemy such as guns, parts of Zeppelins, aeroplanes, Fokkers &amp; so on &amp; also Captain Guynerners aeroplane all bedecked with flowers &amp; ribbons. Napoleons tomb is in this building but we failed to see it, only the three stone slabs from his tomb at St Helena and the Copper Sarcophagus with the mourning flag used for bringing his ashes to France in 1810. There was a fearful crush of people visiting the tomb. We then proceeded via Rue de Grenelles to the Parc</p>
