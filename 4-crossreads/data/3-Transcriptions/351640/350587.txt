<p>1-3-15. Another anniversary today is that of the Prussians entering Paris in 1871.  They expected to be in Paris in 1914, they nearly were, but the hope of realisation was short lived.  A wonderful feat of arms it was to prevent them, one which will ever redound to the credit of British arms and valour, no matter how long the world may last.  What may be the ultimate outcome of this war is not now apparent to me, but even if it be against us temporarily, even such pause will not detract from the magnificence of the stand which, in Champagne and Flanders, the few British fighting men have made against the best equipped and most highly trained soldiers every launched for fight against an enemy.  Despised for their fewness they were by German Bill and his officers and he tried to smash them by weight, but his was not quite enough to destroy them, he pushed them back, but in the doing of it he exhausted his strength, whereupon the British at him in true bulldog style  pushing him to where he now stands fast.  The coming summer what will happen?  Wait and see.</p>
