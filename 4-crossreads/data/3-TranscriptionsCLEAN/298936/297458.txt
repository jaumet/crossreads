October 1915
Friday 29
Tent pitching & odd jobs.
Turkish fire very heavy in morning
Several shells fell in over our camp & a great number just over the hill.
Shrapnel falling all over the place.
Roberts hit by spent pellet, but only bruised.
Jack [indecipherable] & two others sent away on the sick list.
The number of sick sent away is alarming.
Heard that Allied troops are landing at Salonica to help Servians.
