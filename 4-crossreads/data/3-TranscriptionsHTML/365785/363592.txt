<p>Aus. Aux. Hospital<br/>Southall, Middlesex<br/>England<br/>2.5.17</p>
<p>My dearest Lady,<br/>Your reg. letter dated 12.2.17 came to hand two or three weeks ago, fancy my letter written last August arriving in Feb.  I have written two or three since then, the last when I heard from Mer. that Fred had fallen and I had posted one a short time before.<br/>Oh! my dear I do feel so sorry for you, you &amp; your dear brother were such real Chums.  I have tried to get some information first hand from men of the 1st Battelion but though we have quite a lot here they were men wounded prior to Nov. 5.  The same old story here as in Egypt you know, <strike>nor fully trained sisters</strike> our men going when first wounded to British Hospitals, in many cases to V.A.D. Hospitals, and then come to our fully trained Sisters when Convalescent, it makes me furious.  In this Town there is a V.A.D. Hospital, the Matron being the only fully trained Nurse &amp; no resident Medical Officer &amp; our Boys go there</p>
