<p>Saturday, 3 July, 1915<br/>On fatigues all day preparing troop decks for wounded, although this is an old tub she is remarkably well equipped with stores &amp; hospital necessaries.  All day we just crawled along until nightfall when we steamed to 14 knots, with every light extinguished every precaution was taken, as submarines are about this region, a transport that left Mudros before us has not reported yet it is believed that she was sunk, her name is the Ionian.</p>
<p>Sunday, 4 July, 1915<br/>All day long we took a zig zag route and at night time we made great speed, I never thought that men could be so frightened of submarines as the crew are on this old tub, every one from the skipper down to the black crew.  Each man sleeps with a lifebelt under his head, our chaps are very nonchalant about it and are joking the crew.  On fatigue all day preparing decks for wounded, the nurses are always getting them selves &amp; us embarrassed by appearing at the wrong moment and mostly when Australian language is flying about.</p>
