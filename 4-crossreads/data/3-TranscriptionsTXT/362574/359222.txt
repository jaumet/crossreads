My Dear Mrs. Jack,
Thanks for your bright &amp; amusing letter dated June 15th.  I'm sorry not to have had a chance of answering it sooner, but the Light Horse have been on the war-path lately.
The Turks attacked in force the other day &amp; got a damn good strafing from the rough Australian &amp; N.Z. mounted men.  Things were very mixed for a while &amp; bullets &amp; shells were flung carelessly about, but we got busy on the Turk &amp; started him running.  The Light Horse followed them up &amp; captured over 3000.  If our horses had been fresh I think we would have bagged the lot.  We returned yesterday from a five days chase after them, &amp; you can imagine what we looked like.  We had a fair number of casualties but not a patch on what we should have had.
