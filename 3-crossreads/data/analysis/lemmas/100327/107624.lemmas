 11/10/15 Can hear littl bird sing around , as a rule they are veri scarc . Sever bush cover dens with yellow flower ? the onli bloom seen so far sinc arriv . Quiet day with shower of rain in afternoon which we could see come mile away over the ship strewn sea and over from Suvla Bay . Went up to observ post and pull sandbag out and had a quiet look through my telescop at the trench of our dear friend . Such an untidi place spot loop hole c but realli at such short distanc the nake eye almost take it all in . At dark 3 men crept out and went as far as C - , found it consist of two separ hole both with littl hole like trap door in the bottom Return unseen and report , onli the usual exchang of shot and bomb go on this even realli noth special . The man Reed who has been miss for some day suffer from loss of memori , wander along beach near 1 Div. HQ , turn up again in charg of someon who found him quit derang and a nervous wreck and he will have to be sent away at onc . Quit normal until about a week ago when a shell blew him clean off the fire step but did not injur him . Quiet night and so to bed 12/10/15 Rain , and cold wind pitch dark . Evident rain again dure the night . Grow dawn ? glimps of Cape Gaba Tepe through break in the sap . The beach cemeteri look well kempt and neat . Good swim off lighter and clean and fresh after it , well worth the tire climb back . Pass thick patch of grave on hillsid . Officer 's , and at his feet score of littl tin wooden cross in row . In fire trench 2 . Love sunshin at 0900 note two bird sing but could not se them
