<p><u>Wednesday June 23rd 1915.</u>  Another very fine day, sky perfectly clear and sea quite smooth.  At 4pm land was sighted ahead, and at 5.30p we were right opposite Valetta. Thou[?] we were 10 miles off the City could be clearly seen extending from the waters edge to the surrounding hills.  Showing above all other buildings could be seen many church towers and steeples.  50 miles to the Northward hills on the Southerly part of Sicily can be dimly seen through an enveloping haze.  Keeping about the same distance from land we ran along the N.[?] coast of Malta passing several towns along the seashore and on the neighboring hills till 7.30pm when we passed its Westernmost point.  The total area if the Isle is only 111 sm[?].</p>
