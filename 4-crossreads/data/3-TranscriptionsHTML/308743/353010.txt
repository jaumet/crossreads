<p>3 August 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>Hal called &amp; saw how things are going, I passed a fairly good night temp 102.  In the morning a Turkish aeroplane dropped a bomb which fell almost 20 yds from the hospital but luckily no one was hit during the night we landed about 1700 toops of the first Kitcheners army mainly the Glosters &amp; the Worchesters they arrived from Lemnos, they seem a good sturdy crowd &amp; ought to give an excellent account of themselves, All day long a terrific cannonade was going on down at the Cape &amp; was carried up to her by our own guns this evening &amp; the rifles took on the tale later on in the evening.  Gen Cheaval &amp; Chas Cox came back today.  Plenty of "footys" came over at 6 but nothing of any importance to either side.  The Monitor has been shelling the road very heavily for 2 hours &amp; is supported by our Howitzers later the Talbot put a salvo or two into Silent Peter</p>
<p>4 August 1915<br/>Wednesday 51 wks of soldiering 13 wks of Gallipoli</p>
<p>More troops arrived during the night &amp; have filled in every available gully in Anzac they shelled the gully heavily this morning &amp; one chap was shot in hospital, thousands of shells landed &amp; still landing.  The Taube came over again &amp; dropped more bombs but again they did no damage our planes give them a dose of the same medicine &amp; with better effect too.  Artillery has been constant all throughout the day &amp; ours is playing hell with their trenches although their guns are not doing ours much good.  I think they have got the dirty end of the stick, rifle fire is still pretty brisk &amp; snipers are fairly active again, We expect a bit of a counter by the Turks tonight although don't expect it to be of any weight if it is they will get all &amp; more than they want</p>
