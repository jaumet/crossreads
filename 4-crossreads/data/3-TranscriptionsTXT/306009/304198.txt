 1915 Jan. 12 Tue. Suez very pretty - Lovely Day &ndash; Bought oranges and dried figs from the Egyptians who came alongside &ndash; one cruiser in port. Left anchorage at 12.30 a.m. &amp; started up canal (87 miles long, 27 yds. Wide and 27 ft. deep.) Very pretty at entrance but afterwards dreary waste of sand on both sides, on which are being constructed forts, barb-wire entanglements and trenches by several thousand Indian and a few British troops, with which cheery greetings have been exchanged. Several camels (dromedaries) observed in one camp. Evenings, from last night, are now a trifle chilly.
