<p>visitors books &amp; had afternoon tea there, a first rate institution. Altogether was very pleased with Cambridge. At night no lights were allowed at all &amp; it was very difficult to get along. London was not half so bad as a portion only of the lamps were obscured. Caught the 7.4 back &amp; reached London just in time to get a taxi &amp; rush across to Euston in order to catch the mail to Glasgow at 8.50. A small tip gave me a carriage to myself &amp; I slept most of the way but was glad to get out once &amp; receive a cup of tea &amp; scone from some good ladies at 2 A.M. in the morning.</p>
<p>Sunday 14th Jan.</p>
<p>Arrived in Glasgow about 8.30 &amp; was ushered in to a buffet &amp; given tea &amp; cakes after which I took a taxi to the Harpers. Went to church in the morning with them &amp; a stroll in the evening but had to have a sleep between 6 &amp; 8 as I could not keep awake.</p>
