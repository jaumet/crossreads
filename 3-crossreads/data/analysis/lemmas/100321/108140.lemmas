 16/1/19 Brussel leafless ) we came on rather ugli suburb . Soon ran into the fine town and put up at the Palac Hotel . I thought the build in mani case look as if paint and renov were cri need . The Rue Neuv is a crowd and fashion street and here we locat Hislop and the Brigad rest hous . Plenti of theatr and cinema . Had afternoon tea and cake for 4 . 20 franc . Promenad after dark and locat the Hotel de Vill which seen by electr light seem a splendid squar border with old build all of maediv architectur . Saw a monument to Nurs Cavel and her hospit . Theatr Royal or Opera Hous is not impos view from the outsid . Shop well stock but seem dear
