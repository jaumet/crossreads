  
 Sunday 7 April 1918 The Hun shows no sign of coming on again.  But expect he will as there is nothing between him & Amiens 'cept  us !! 
 Monday 8 April 1918 The Brigade has dug well in and the line is more organised.  We have only six guns behind us but they try & do the work of sixty. 
 Tuesday 9 April 1918 Everyone on the Q.V. as reports say the Hun is going to make a final attack to get Amiens. 
 Wednesday 10 April 1918 The threatened attack did not come off.  The diggers are in good spirits and aching to get a shot at someone!! 
 Thursday 11 April 1918 All the cows in Villers Bretoneux are taken care of!!  To say nothing of chickens & other animals.  The village is not knocked about much. 
 Friday 12 April 1918 We went up to Villers Bret. & salvaged some blankets & a stove to make our miserable lives happy.  Plenty of aeroplanes appearing. 
 Saturday 13 April 1918 Saw over 200 British planes up today & not one Hun in sight!  The 'planes were doing good deal of bomb droppg. on his front line trenches.  Also mach. gunning his troops.
