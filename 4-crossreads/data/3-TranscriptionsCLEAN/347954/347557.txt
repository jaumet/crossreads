against this rotten stuff.  The days are still hot & sultry & bad smells from the dead almost take ones breath away.  Our old donkey has given birth to a lovely little baby donkey & its antics are watched by all with great glee.  It is marvellous how it survives the shot & shell which daily goes across the plain on which these animals graze.  We are at last on to something definite & we hope it may mean finish to this campaign here.  Everything is astir & general bustle is the order of the day.  Iron rations are being taken up behind the trenches & rest houses for the wounded are springing up everywhere.  A general attack is being launched all along our lines & our boys are all alive to a good amount of killing, etc.  August 6th, Friday & a day prior to our own gentle surprise, the Turks on our right wing attempted a bomb charge on a trench we had captured a week previously at a loss of a hundred men - they gained their objective temporarily but the Turks who gained the trenches never got back to their lines again.  I saw three go along as prisoners & a whole heap more piled dead in a corner nearby.  Their own field guns killed them in our trenches & altho the scrapping continued throughout the day the casualties were not too numerous considering all things.
