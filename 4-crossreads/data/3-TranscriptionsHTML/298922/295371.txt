<p>Wednesday 14 February 1917</p>
<p><strike>39 today</strike></p>
<p>Marched on to BAYOUD &ndash; do you remember me telling you of our first fight here early in June last year 8 months ago &ndash; The sand hummocks have blown a bit but I never expected to be here again. However the Yeomanry left their Tents standing &amp; also some SCENT Candles, a bottle of Beer etc. We were very glad to have such good accommodation. I don't feel much older but I know I look it. I only hope ere another year comes around I may be home in Australia <strike>with my new wife</strike> even if it is to fight Droughts, Fires, Floods etc.</p>
<p><strike>TELL JOE I am sure Dolly would like a letter from him.</strike></p>
