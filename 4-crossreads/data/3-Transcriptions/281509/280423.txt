<p>19 July 1916<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>Up betimes no word of moving on  Go on route march Capt. Graham leading. See barbed wire entanglements trenches dugouts, etc. Pass thro' village where 3rd Batt were getting ready to go out to trenches Big patches of light coloured flannelette sewn onto back, to indicate to artillery our own men when a charge is in progress. Great activity continues at this point. Heavy bombardments continue day &amp; night. Artillery move on tonight. An inspiring spectacle to watch them moving out.</p>
