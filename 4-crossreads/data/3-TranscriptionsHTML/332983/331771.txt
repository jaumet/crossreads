<p>whelmning numbers, cant believe it The first official envelopes were issued yesterday<br/>11/8/1915<br/>A very fierce attack last night at 8.30 continued for about an hour. This morning a warship put 2 shots into Krithia Village. As I write another one went in. By all reports we have the Turks surrounded if so, it is only a matter of time, and they will have to give in. The two landings are linked up with us, so we extend a lot over 9 miles. A report that Maidos town is captured. The shots this morning were fired from a monotor 9.7 Howitzers.<br/>The Attack last night was partly made by us and partly by the Turks. Very fierce while it lasted, a terrible cannonade. The Turks were repulsed. They are very stubborn fighters. 8.30 A.M. very quiet, also hot, flies troublesome. Went to look at a big gun the French are mounting behind our lines 9.2 or 120 pounders, they are more of a naval gun, mounted on circular rails, so as to be able to fire at any point. Absolutely the best gun pits I ever saw, about 10 feet deep. The French also have a number of 4.7</p>
