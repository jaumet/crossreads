  
 11 Monday Discharged from hospital, although I am still feeling pretty sick, the whole of my body is full of pains.  Everyone is discharged as soon as they begin to get better.  There are a good few fellows in the ambulances suffering from Influenza, some are confined to their beds.  Went back up to our billets again.  Spent rather a crook night.  Had a touch of rheumatics in my right foot during the night. 
 12 Tuesday It was raining & snowing when I got up this morning; as the ground was wet the snow melted a soon as it fell.  We have a route march every morning & afternoon now.  I am exempt for a couple of days, therefore do not go out on same.  It gets very monotonous in the billets all day, most of the chaps play cards & gamble to pass away the time. 
 13 Wednesday I am still keeping pretty crook, & a good few more have contracted influenza, three out of the ambulance have been evacuated to hospital. It is very funny here of a night time, everything is very quiet, when someone starts coughing & in the space of a minute you can hardly hear yourself talk for the coughing, nearly everybody starts.  It is still keeping very wet & dreary, everywhere is very muddy.
