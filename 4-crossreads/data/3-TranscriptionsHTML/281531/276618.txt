<p>14/8/18<br/>Herleville<br/>Slept until 3.30 p.m. and then got up feeling none the worse for recent experiences. Went up to a conference presided over by the General at Duggans H.Q. A Hun cooker with dead putrefying cooks lies on the road here. Got back to Bn. H.Q and held a conference of company comdrs. As we were finishing mess the Hun shelled us out of the place and we precipitately retired to our dugout. Received a S.M. telling of Uncle Willie's death. As soon as it was dark we started once more to advance our line and evidently there is some "boxing on" as sounds of bombs &amp; bullets reach us. Burge 24th killed &amp; two sergts hit just at our door. One man</p>
