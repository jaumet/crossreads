 November 1916 5 continued heavy &amp; to-night each company have sent out their sledges to bring in the wounded. 6th   We have heard further details of the advance to the effect that we are holding the second line of Fritz's trenches, but he has attacked it in force &amp;  made a break of about 250 yds. &amp; are preparing for a heavy attack. Yesterday I went out with Capt Reid to locate a drain along the railway.  We continued with it this morning &amp; this afternoon I went out with three other sappers &amp; took the levels for about 100 chains.  We just heard that the Germans bombarded our headquarters at Fricourt on the night of the 4th but did no serious damage.
