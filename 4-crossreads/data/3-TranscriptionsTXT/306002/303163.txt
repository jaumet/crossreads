 27.5.15 Thurs. 27th.  The Warboats have been rumbling like thunder all day.  Things are quiet here generally but we had to stand to arms at 8.30 this morning as a dozen or so Japanese bombs were hoisted into the Turkish trenches &amp; it was thought that they may get desperate &amp; charge us, but they did not, although the bombs played havoc with their trenches.  Our aeroplane was only one day off duty &amp; she is as busy as usual again hovering over us.  Snipers have given us a fairly safe time to-day, "a bit of a change from yesterday".  It is rumored here that the Majestic has also been sunk, but rumors are afloat of peace &amp; several other things &amp; are generally taken with a grain of salt.  The only reliable news we get of the war is what happens in &amp; around this valley (known as Shrapnel Valley &amp; it has earned its name).
