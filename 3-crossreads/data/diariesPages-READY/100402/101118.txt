Our front lies about 800-1000 yards east of the village of Lhon, about five kilos along this road, Nesle-Amiens. Last night or this morning our people moved up again some distance capturing a few prisoners, some M.G.s about six 77's. Fritz replied with heavy shelling especially about here our casualties were three, Groves, Ridgeway (serious) Sgt. McRae. Also Sgt. Sellers was hit whilst we were coming in last afternoon. All day Fritz has been shelling the ridge ahead of us his planes have been active downing one of balloons. Our people brought down two of his ?planes in flames yesterday on this sector. Possibly move up further to-night it is rumoured that there is a big stunt in the morning.

Last night was fairly quiet, except for the four 6 inch guns in front of us, about fifty yards from us. Fritz shelled a bit using gas H.E. but not much, last night to-day.
The stunt did not come off. Australian mail very welcome. Another casualty. Prewer wounded, making five to date in this salient.
