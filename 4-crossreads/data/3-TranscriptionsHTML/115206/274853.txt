<p>October 1918.<br/>Thursday 10</p>
<p>With 2nd Batt,120. Regt Hdqrs<br/>Left for the line at 4.30 am and have been hunting for my officer since then. Country about here very pretty. Met Mr Cooper at 5.15 am just in time to do the hop over with he and Page. Page had a mg bullet through his rifle. The going has been pretty tough and we consolicated a few hours later, [indecipherable] the first objective near Vaux Vigney &ndash; Two Batt of Yanks coming to our relief were badly knocked about by artillery and mg fire. A very rough day.</p>
