<p>of great sorrow to many was the news that several thousand gallons of rum had been emptied at Anzac owing to the difficulty of  removal.<br/>Thursday 16th. Once more threaded my way to the 1st. A.S.H. &amp; handed in an application for a transfer and asked the O.C. for a letter stating under what terms the transfer would take place. This he gave me &amp; it stated  that all N.C.O. positions were filled but he would give me the first vacancy. Had tea with the warrant officer &amp; received a letter from Laughland &amp; Mackay telling me that my cards cost &pound; 2-18 the hundred including 15/- for the die for the Australian badge. This was very satisfactory &amp; very reasonable to my mind as they will be a lasting souvenir of Gallipoli.<br/>Friday 17th December  1915. Anniversary of my going into camp.

What dreams have been dispelled? 8 or 9 months ago we set off cheerily to attack the Turk in his stronghold</p>
