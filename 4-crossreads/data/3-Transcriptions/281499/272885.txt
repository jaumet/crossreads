<p>We had to run the gauntlet in one place for about 200 yds, for we were quite exposed to the Germans but they never shot at us, we then went through a shallow trench to the firing line, &amp; here we had a look at a job we had to do this afternoon, I can't make old Fritz out although he can see hundreds of our men quite close to him he never shoots at them, they work all day long right under his nose &amp; real close to him, I think he is frightened of giving himself away for at the present time he is hiding anywhere &amp; never discloses his presence from fear of our guns which never stop night or day.           The Colonel was up there also &amp; we had a short yarn with him &amp;   then came back, &amp; had dinner such as it was a piece of dry bread &amp; water yes &amp; I thought I was lucky to have it one can't be too particular these times if ever I get back Ill be able to sleep out in the yard anywhere &amp; in all weathers &amp; live on</p>
