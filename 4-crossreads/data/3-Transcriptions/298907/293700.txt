<p>sun was to be seen.</p>
<p>25th. This afternoon two other chaps &amp; I having an invitation from Mr Jervis who offered to take us round the Park &amp; back home to his place for tea, slipped down to Hagley Road terminus where we were to meet, to tell the truth I did not like the idea of going at first &amp; I wanted to back out, but he seemed so keen on my coming that eventually I went, &amp; I'll say right here that I was never so glad that I went as I was today, they met us sharp for he had brought his daughter a jolly fine girl, &amp; it was no time before she &amp; I tailed off &amp; were yarning like as if we knew one another for years we both had a topic in common namely photography</p>
