Unfortunately on April 21st our Gunnery Lieutenant Laidlow [Laidlaw ?] was taken seriously ill and the following morning at 8.50 on April 22nd he died and being then in tropical climes just South of Java we buried him at sea at 11.15 a.m. our Chaplain Hardie conducting the burial service - On arrival at Brisbane on  May 16th  a hearty welcome was awaiting us and everything possible done  by council and citizens to mark our day of returning a most memorable one, and so this lasted until May 19th when we took our departure for Sydney at 6.30 am.
