<p>send a service card along as soon as I get my letters.<br/>A few days ago our section got leave and we rode out to the battle field to have a look round; it was not very amusing but I got some copper bands of some shells which had not exploded &ndash; They are rather nicely marked from the rifeling in the gun and if polished ought to make jolly nice serviette rings &ndash; a lot of chaps sent them home form the Peninsula they tell me &ndash; so I will send them home first chance<br/>Also I have a piastre broach which I bought in Alex &amp; did not have a chance to send home before &ndash; it was in my pocket all through the scraps here so I'll send it along with the bands &ndash; It has rather a cheap jewelry look about it so give it away if you don't like it.<br/>Next Day<br/>I went over to try and see Colin last night but he was away on some duty &ndash; so I enquired about Leycesters wound and found that it was slighter than they thought and he expects to be sent to his Regt any day.<br/>We have started Rifle drill again to keep us exercised - I suppose we want it but it is funny to be back on it again. "Not a move" is the order of the day and it is the joke of the camp.<br/>Was glad to see in the S.S. Journal that Father was a member of the Country Club.<br/>Love to Father and your self Mother<br/>I am<br/>Your loving son<br/>Robert C Wilson</p>
