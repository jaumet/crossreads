<p>Still Calm but cold this morning &amp; a fog but feel better ere long.  I shall be hungry for some sun, I wish I had been sent to Australia now, but the better place takes too long- away from Regiment.<br/>Majority of men wonderfully better, &amp; more cheerful.<br/>Sea is now a dirty green not the blue of Mediterranean &amp; all the Boats we pass are very plainly branded all along their sides so no mistake can be made re neutrality.<br/>Crossing the Bay of Biscay now &amp; a heavy swell on.<br/>We get the daily War News by wireless, nothing since Roumania came in, of importance, but we are only told what is good for us.</p>
