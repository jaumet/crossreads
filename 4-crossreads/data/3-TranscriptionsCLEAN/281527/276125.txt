 Spent the whole day in bed feeling very unwell owing to an over dose of J.Walker the previous evening. Having a head could not help noticing what an amount of noise there is about the place. Some of the men had put up a swing in some trees & this was a source of great delight to the little French kiddies around who flocked to it chattering and squealing as loud as they could. 
 13/2/18 Quite recovered and carried on. A drizzly wet day. Went down to the 24th and yarned with Col. James. Received an invitation from Matron and Sisters No 2 AGH Boulogne for an evening and sent two lorries with forty officers. James is in a comfortable billet & Madam's stove gives out great heat. Returned to BdeHqs and Peter Borwick came in
