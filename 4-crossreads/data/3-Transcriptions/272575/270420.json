<p>for me.    a couple of days ago I received one parcel a cake from Min, it carried splendidly .. and was very much appreciated the other parcels have not arrived yet.   they may come any day for every day brings a fresh wagon load of parcels and mail  I have just succeeded in gumming the two flannel flowers Betty sent me, onto two Post Cards, one for Nurse and one for Elsie.   I think they carry better than any of the wild flowers .. the soft silky sheen on the petals lasts, but the green tips fade.   I am sending a Registered packet of Photos and Post Cards along this mail hope they will arrive safely.   there are 5 photos, of self one for Min the Rest you are to do with as you please.   on the paper they are wrapped in I just wrote a couple of lines.    Mumps are prevalent in this camp 3 huts in these lines are Isolated .. and all the men in them in quarantine.  It is still cold and today a cold wind is blowing, but the weather has improved considerably some days lately have been quite mild, and the Ice all round is beginning to thaw.   soon it will be all gone, while it was freezing on the low</p>
