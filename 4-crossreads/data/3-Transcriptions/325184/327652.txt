<p>Sunday 9th November<br/>Left Bassano for Venice via Montello Plateau &ndash; Piave River &ndash; Trevise &ndash; Maestre. Commenced journey at 8.30 am. Montello very interesting. A steep climb up to the plateau up a rather bad road and owing to greasy surface of roadway due to light rain, we had great difficulty in getting the car to the top &ndash; everybody pushing including a local peasant, whose wife and 10 small children looked on with much interest and amusement. A great deal of roadmaking has been carried out here by the Italian Army. On the plateau hard fighting has taken place- at one period for a month continuously. Pass also very interesting. Bridges only temporarily repaired. One can imagine what a terrible obstacle this river becomes in the rainy season &ndash; a rapid and turbulent stream. Lunched by river and went down eastern bank recrossing again at [blank space] and passing through Trevise reached Maestre about 4.30pm.  Motored through Guiliano where at 5pm we took ferry for Venice, reaching the Grand Canal in about 20 minutes. Changed to a second ferry and traversed the Grand Canal to its end.  Took rooms at Royal Daniele Hotel where we are very comfortable. Dined at hotel.   Our Italian Colonel guide left us and is staying with an Aunt near by. After dinner we roamed round the Piazza of st Mark and environs. Most shops closed. Beautiful moonlight night. Very fine effect on S Marks Square</p>
<p>Monday 10th November<br/>Rather foggy in early morning. At 8.30 took gondola down Grand Canal to railway station and returned by a short route along devious narrow canals. At 10 am met Col Vangetti and with him visited st Mark's. Beautiful internal mosaics. History of fall of Man in the Garden of Eden depicted in Mosaic. Took several photos.<br/>Bronze horses removed during the war are now being replaced and the necessary scaffolding is all in position. Saw "main" business street [indecipherable], bought some nice views of Venice buildings (which are being sent for me direct to Australia) stamps for Chris and a bronze model gondola. Sun now shining a little through the fog. Lunched at Hotel at noon. At 12.30 took gondola for station and caught 1.30pm train for Maestre. Our chauffeur and car here awaited us. Commenced journey at 2.30 for Udine again crossing the Piave at the spot where we crossed on 9th inst. Later in afternoon crossed the River Tagliamento at this point approximately wide. The bridge has been thrice destroyed and is now in process of reconstruction. Solid stone piers &amp; arches.</p>
