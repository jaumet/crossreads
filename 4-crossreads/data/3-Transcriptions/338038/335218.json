<p>2nd Lieutenant.</p>
<p>Mails seem to have been hung up somewhere. Your letters of Jany 10th being the last received here, although I hear a big mail is expected in Camp tomorrow. Havent heard from Exeter for Lord knows how long.</p>
<p>I expect the summer will be practically over when this reaches you. It must have been a frightfully trying one and I do   <strike>you</strike> hope that    <strike>both of</strike> you are not feeling any ill effects. Had a letter from Mr Broughton by same mail as brought your last &amp; was surprised to hear Mr Trebeck Snr had retired from the Firm.</p>
<p>Those photos I sent by last mail. One is labelled   <strike>your</strike> for yourselves, and I would like Mrs Forsyth to have one &amp; also Mr Broughton. I posted them altogether to save packing.</p>
