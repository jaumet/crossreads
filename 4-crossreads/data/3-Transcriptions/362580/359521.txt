<p>I receive the Argus fairly regularly now but lately have not got the usual ones from Osburnes &amp; Mollie &amp; Jess, suppose they will all come together.</p>
<p>Sister Ralston &amp; Bolton arrived in the same boat as Essie Craig.  I received letters from the three of them from Fremantle.</p>
<p>Sister Martin has not been at all well lately &ndash; worried about her brother, who is an <u>Orderley</u> &amp; has been sent back to Aust. on account of bad health.</p>
<p>Think I must stop now, have told you a lot of <u>twoddle</u>.  Oh, amongst some of my presents a beautiful bottle of perfume from my fried Mr C. at Alexandria with a very nice letter.</p>
<p>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all &amp; just wish I could peep in &amp; see you.</p>
<p>Your loving sister<br/>Edith</p>
