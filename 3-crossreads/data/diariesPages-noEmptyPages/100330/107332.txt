Thursday 14th 6/17
During the Morning I wandered about the Bush which they call here Woods, I was charmed at the numerous Flowers especially the Wild Honeysuckle which is very plentiful smells very sweet. The Brier Rose grows everwhere also wild violets, As for Bird life there are several kinds, they are very numerous, one Bird whistles like a Canary they are everywhere also the Cook Koo he calls out now again, especially in the Morning early he is at his best. As I am writing these lines I am sitting on a Box amongst the Honeysuckle Briar Rose the birds are flittering about me everywhere, as the weather is fairly hot there is plenty of shade. After I had Dinner I had a bush bath. I got a Bucket of water from the soak took it into the bush stripped off had a good sponge, of course bye and bye we will have all these conveniences provided. Every night there are trucks of Timber arriving so it wont be long. As I was booked on Duty at Midnight which they call here 24 oclock Driving
