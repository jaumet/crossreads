  
 Saturday 3 June 1916 Route march out on to battlefield.  Tremendous big trenches out there.  Went out again in evening, had a good look through old trenches and gun mounds. 
 Sunday 4 June 1916 No parade all day.  Felt pretty crook.  Think I am getting mumps. Dust storm in evening.  Everything left outside tents was burried by drifting sand.  Wrote to boys (2).  Got news of big sea fight.  Afraid we did not win very much.
