 My dear Judge 
 Many thanks for your letter of Nov 3rd which, as you have no doubt seen by the f.s.p.c. [field service post card] I sent on Jan 2nd, was received by me on that date. My reply is somewhat delayed, but then of late all my correspondence has gone to rack & ruin, so to speak. 
 It is absolutely surprising how "cut off" from the rest of the world one feels out here. Newspapers are seen irregularly & one almost comes to regard outside happenings, not directly connected with the war, as only wanton passing notice. Though we are not particularly hard worked the time slips by very quickly, I suppose because there are so few incidents to mark stages. An incoming & generally unexpected Australian mail about once a fortnight give one an hour or so of enjoyment & "re-anchoring" if you can follow the metaphor - & then you slip back into the sphere of indefinite abstraction again. I do not want to give you the impression that the life here is unpleasant. 
 On the contrary it is very enjoyable in its way: but in other ways it is very empty & tends to develop in one a feeling of utter indifference to any other things which do not concern it. 
 I suppose it affects different people differently. As for myself I often feel contented, unambitious, & as though I had been living like this for years & would continue to do so almost indefinitely. However, letters from home & friends pull me out of that mood for a while once a fortnight at any rate. 
 I am glad to hear the news about Caesar - & join with you most heartily in the hope that his luck will remain
