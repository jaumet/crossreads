Thursday 26 May
Most glorious Sydney day to-day the temp. was up very high. Practically no shells fired all day, but things livened up near the Gare de Strazeele to-night. Still no wounded.
Identification of troops opposing is wanted perhaps a raid will be necessary to-morrow night. No raid is necessary now as identification was established by a Fritz being killed his papers taken.
Friday 17 May
Glorious weather still no cases. To-day Fritz has been shelling round about the station has set fire to big stores, sheds houses. In fact the fire about one hundred yards from here was a beauty.
