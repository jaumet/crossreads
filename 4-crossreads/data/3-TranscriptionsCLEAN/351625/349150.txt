  
 here that we used to get in the other place & I am not sorry either.  I am sending you another photo of the officers & N.C.O. of reinfor. in case the other does not reach you.  I expect it won't be long before Bob has his 3 stars, there are officers here, with three that arn't as smart as he is.  Ken fears getting into the Juveniles here & if he does he will not get to France for a good while yet.  I believe reinforcements are wanted pretty badly from this Batt.  Give my love & kisses to all & much to yourself. 
 I remain Your loving son Douglas
