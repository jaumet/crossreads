Very few appeared anxious to join the sentries on the "Step". It would be quite enough when their own turn of two hours came round, & after having turned in they found it anything but pleasant having to "turn out" without scarcely having closed an eyelid, so it seemed.
On relieving the sentry & receiving any orders he may have, or instructions & directions he may wish to give, on mounting the step, the first thing that strikes one is, how close to the top of the parapet the head is, & how very close to the top of the head the bullets seem to be.
