The Ceramic left Devonport for London to discharge her cargo of wheat which she brought from Australia at 7 o`clock pm.

END OF PART 1

P.S.S. 
The trip over on board the Troopship Ceramic, was, on the whole, very pleasant, My Reinforcement was allotted the best position on the boat for comfort & easy travelling, Our quarters was the old Second Class dining Saloon & it was situated right amidships.’

We slept on hammocks which were slung to the ceiling at night above the tables, And at day time they were taken down & rolled up neatly & placed in the crates provided for the purpose & are thereby kept out of the way.

I was on the water for 45 days altogether & was not sick during the voyage. The Ceramic is a very good sea boat in rough weather.
