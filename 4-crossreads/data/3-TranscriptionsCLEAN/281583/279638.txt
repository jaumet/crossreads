  
 The old matter of my transferring to the Supply re-opened today and \i gladly consented, especially as \i was told that I was certain to get my Stars within a month.  I leave the Company tomorrow and go in as a "Staff Sergeant.  The work will be much easier, the pay the same, and \i will be gaining a lot more experience.  Major C assured me that he was well behind me also that the Colonel had my name down for a vacancy already existing and that he was only waiting for me to pick up some Supply knowledge. 
 This coupled with the fact that I am in urgent need of rest decides me.  Some have already told me that I am looking decidedly worried and after my 6 weeks experience in the Big Push down the Somme, I fancy I must be looking very careworn.  Moreover it will enable me to do a little more letter writing than I have been able to do.  This worries me immensely when I know that everyone is expecting letters from me and I am not sending any owing to my inability to do so. 
 If I get the Commission I am after it will be Requisitioning officer.  The duties are to scour the country side for motors buying up supplies etc. for the Troops.  Quite a nice job with plenty of time to do it in.
