  
 & was returning to France to-day, we tried to arrange to see each other somehow but unfortunately the Authorities over here are absolutely the limit on the leave question & I could'nt get off at all. 
 Since our arrival in this country I've had quite a good time with the single exception of this leave business, and am just finishing off a course of instruction at Candahar Barracks, Tidworth. 
 I expect you get most of the news from "Wansley", so shall not repeat it all. 
 Fortunately have not felt the weather much & am in splendid health. 
 Trust you are all well, with love to all 
 Yours affectionately Chas H. Copp.
