<p>Dearest Ruth<br/>This postcard I got the same place as Franks, &amp; I hope you like it though it is not pretty. Fancy yesterday I saw the King, Queen, Prince of Wales, &amp; Princess Mary, they were driving along in a beautiful carriage with four beautiful horses pulling it, and two men (called Postillions) on two of the horses, and the two men had beautiful clothes on too, so everything was beautiful. The King &amp; his family did not stop and speak to me but I suppose they did not know I was Mrs Burrowes husband.<br/>Lots of love and kisses from Dad. XOXOXO</p>
