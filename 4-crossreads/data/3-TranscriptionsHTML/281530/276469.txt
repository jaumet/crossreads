<p>Returned along the C.T. with a 5th Div. officer. Passed a crop and laid out in it beside a grave that was being dug by three of our chaps, was the "finished article" &ndash; a monument to War. It was a dead German. Stinking he lay on his back, his steel helmet on and a thing that was once a face upwards. A belly puffed with gas and brown withered rotting hands. Someone had powdered it liberally with the white of chloride of lime. We passed by unmoved. Colonel Henry Cohen CMG D.S.O. called in to elaborate plans with me for tomorrow. He is a wag. "Wiltshire &amp; Cohen, Butchers, Families Waited on Daily". Chalmers out on patrol found 2 dead Huns in a post killed by one of our shells. A Light m.g. lay alongside and our chaps carried it back. Other patrols searched fruitlessly for the bodies of Tyler &amp; Bundon killed last night but found only a few odds &amp; ends where Huns ratted them</p>
