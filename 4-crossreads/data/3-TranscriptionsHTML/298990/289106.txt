<p>10/12/16  Church parade 11am bitterly cold arrived in a most un- Christianlike frame of mind owing to 'B" Co. being late for parade but we fortunately arrived on the Brigade grounds just in time.  Padre Bladen dilated on the sin of getting fed-up.  After lunch rode out with the other Battalion Commanders and reconnoitred the ground for a tactical exercise.  The General was out also.  Had a good gallop back over the fields.  There are many hares and partridges about here.  At Orderly Room dealt with 4 cases and inflicted punishments.  A hateful job.  One chap got three days F.P. and had never had a crime before.  He seemed a good boy.  It hurt to stain his clean conduct sheet.</p>
<p>11/12/16 A lowering grey morning.  Nearly all the men were away on duties and baths but the rest were marched out to a place about 2 1/2 miles out in open country.  It was very cold and ice lay heavy on the ground.  The country is of the "landscape target" variety and something like that near Noordpeene looking towards St. Omer.  The thick rectangular woods are leafless and a straight out drive through one of them would be very pretty in springtide.  In the distance is the steeple of Vignacourt church and to the left topping a rise one comes suddenly on a tiny compact little village with its houses packed tightly together and forming almost a perfect square.  Went over the ground for our attack with the officers and, returning, had a good gallop over the open.  It rained heavily in the afternoon and in the evening "A" Co had a very fine concert in the chateau hall &ndash; a place that has seen many nights of musique for the remains of an old minstrels gallery is still there.</p>
