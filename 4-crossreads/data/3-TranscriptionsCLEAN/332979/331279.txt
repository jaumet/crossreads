I was playing Draughts when the Alarm was given that a strange Steamer was approaching on our Port Side. On going on deck, all hands were very excited as the Stranger did not fly any Signal. Our Armed Cruiser (Orcoma) shot out to meet her. The Walmer Castle turned her stern on to her also our boat did the same. The Stranger was surrounded & the Ships & Guns were trained on to her. Eventually the Stranger put up her Flags & was slowed to proceed. The impression was that she might have been a Decoy Ship for the Submarines & that a Submarine might have been behind her waiting to strike. The was no mistake it was a scatter & Boats, Our slow boats made off in all directions
