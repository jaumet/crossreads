Thursday 12 July 1917.
With C.B.F.A. once more and attending the parades which are same as before. All supers. were on the mules this morning.
Those 50 AMC. details mentioned previous marched in today & they are real wasters not up to the standard of Amb. men. 
Rumors at to where we move "shortly" are started & the no of "furphies" are nearly as bad as Seyr. camp between Jan. & May this year.
