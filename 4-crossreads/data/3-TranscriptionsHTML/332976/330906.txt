<p>August 1917<br/>4th   It is still raining &amp; has continued all day.   We paraded in "full marching order" this morning &amp; went for a route march for over 13 miles. &amp; returned wet through at about 2 P.M.<br/>5th   It was raining all the morning but cleared up before dinner.   All the crops are looking in a delapidated state after the heavy rain combined with the wind, &amp; most of them are laying flat.<br/>After the morning parade we were dismissed &amp; had the day off.<br/>This afternoon Pritchard &amp; I went for a ride around the country, &amp; returned after tea.   The Major returned from leave to-night.</p>
