<p>2.  the Pictures of England are just as Dad painted them.  While at Bath we went all over the old Roman Baths &amp; visited all the beautiful Parks.  We went to the real old Restaurant to dine.  I will send a Souvenir of Bath later on a book of views.  I have been making some pants for myself again.  I have made one pair &amp; have two more to make.  I've also had socks to darn too.  I fit in the time very well &amp; rarely have 5 minutes waste time.  I practise Cricket at the Nets nearly every night &amp; at 7.30 pm I do some sprint Training.  I might pick up something if I'm in nick.  Last Saturday I went to Salisbury &amp; after Tea, I rowed myself up the River about 2 miles &amp; back again.  It is very narrow, hardly as wide as deep creek &amp; certainly not as deep, still it is very pretty</p>
