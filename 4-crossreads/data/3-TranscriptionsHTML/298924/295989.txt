<p>Tuesday 7 January 1919<br/>Beautiful weather now, but all ranks are chafing at the delay in getting away, no fresh rumours.<br/>Please order for me to await arrival from Peapes, Sydney, a suit of mufti &ndash; chose Homespun Australian Tweed of grey material &ndash; tell them to <u>hold</u> till I arrive to try on as there will be a rush for civil clothes.  They have my measure &amp; beyond the Tummy might have altered I am little different.</p>
