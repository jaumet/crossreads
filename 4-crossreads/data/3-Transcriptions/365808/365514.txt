The men dig pot holes &amp; get beautiful drinking water &ndash; rather hard but tasting so well that it's a dence of a job to keep them from drinking it without chlorination. It certainly does seem a great pity to put the beastly taste of chlorine into such water but we dont know what it is draining through or how it may become contaminated.
