<p>20 Thursday<br/>Rather a hot day.  Was put off quartermaster's fatigue as there was no work to do there, so I had to go back to drill again &amp; my word they do make a fellow drill too.  Went for a walk over to Cholderton &amp; took my new camera to see how it worked, afterwards developing the photos I took, which came out splendid.</p>
<p>21 Friday<br/>Very strenuous stretcher drill indulged in all the morning (the first time I have perspired for a long while).  Kit Inspection held in the afternoon to inquire into shortages.  Went for a walk to a village called Grateley which is about 5 miles away, was talking to a Tommy soldier who went through the battle of Mons.  We arrived back about 11 pm.</p>
<p>22 Saturday<br/>Kept busy drilling all the morning.  Got cleaned up in the afternoon but did not go out, stopped at home &amp; <strike>done</strike> developed four films for the corporal in charge of the hut.  Saturday is the cleaning up day here.  everything has to be scrubbed.</p>
<p>23 Sunday<br/>Went on church parade held in the Y.M.C.A.  Went over to Wallop in the evening a distance of about 8 miles.  An Imperial Officer gave us a ride over in his motor car.</p>
