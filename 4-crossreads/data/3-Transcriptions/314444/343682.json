<p>Dearest Father Mother &amp; Dear Dolly,<br/>Recieved your very welcome letters last mail &amp; was pleased to hear you were all well. I hope I recieve most of the parcels you have sent. It is very good of you all to think of them. I will appreciate them.<br/>Well Dears the side is practically alright again. I am now instructing the company on grenade throwing and it will take me some time as I can only have a dozen a day. It is nice and easy. I am feeling as fit as ever otherwise. I had a bit of luck the other day. Allan Mac sent word for me to come &amp; see him &amp; I did so He gave me a tin of porridge 3 tins milk 1 tin arrowroot tin chicken tin pineapple packet biscuits 3 oranges cigarettes tobacco string of figs sugar &amp; I have had a blow out since. It was very good of him. I told him you had recieved a card from him. He is looking tip top &amp; is only 500 yds from me. He said he would give me odd little thing often, so I am going to do alright after all<br/>Well things are going on about the same &amp; we are having nice weather still &amp; hope it continues.<br/>No time to write more<br/>Hoping you are all well<br/>With all my love &amp; kisses<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom.</p>
