<p>Fine, but cloudy. Went up to the dentist in morning but he told me to come back on Monday. Went out with the director afterwards. Lay round &amp; wrote in afternoon &amp; went up to the pictures with Warren Hogarth &amp; Bill Hunter in evening.</p>

<p>Blessed is the man who has found his work&nbsp;&mdash; and then&nbsp;&mdash; gets busy!</p>
