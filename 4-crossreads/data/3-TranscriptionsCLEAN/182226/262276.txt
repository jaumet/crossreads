  
 Saturday 11 September, 1915 
 Watches changed, have to do 18 hours on & 18 hours off. 
 Heavy firing during night. It is reported that Hill 971 & the railway have been captured. If that is so we may safely anticipate an early move from here. 
 Scored a tin of concentrated cream & made some rice & milk which was very acceptable, am looking forward to a repitition if I can get good with the Quartermaster Sgt who has a couple of cases. 
 It continues cold, especially at night. The artillery on both sides was very active during the afternoon, several shells landed on Courtneys. 
 We find our dugout a great blessing you get a bit of peace & quietness. 
 One of our men, Gibson, has been sent to Lemnos suffering from Dysentry. This is the first man we have lost.
