<p>Some fellows who had come to grief in one of the houses of the Wazi quarter returned to seek vengeance &amp;  a Maori was stabbed during the trouble.  This started the others going &amp; furniture was freely thrown into the streets &amp; set alight.  An iron bedstead happened to land on a soldiers head who was looking on &amp; killed him while several wounded by the Redcaps (the English picquets) who appear to have arrived late &amp; they fired indiscrimately into the mob.  What damage was done &amp; how many killed &amp; injured it seems impossible to find out accurately as various rumours are afloat.  I asked a Greek Hotel keeper what he thought was the cause of the trouble &amp; he replied with the proverb that one stone by itself cannot make flour, it requires two stones.</p>
<p><strike>Tuesday</strike>Monday 5th  Spent the day loading the ammunition column &amp; Engineers gear &amp; sailed at  4 or 5 P.M.  All standing to attention  Towards dark evidences of a rough trip was not wanting &amp; all seemed glad to turn in early.  At breakfast next morning many places were vacant a big proportion of the men being sick  The sea was not very rough but a strong breeze, beam on, caused the ship to roll heavily.  The chaps were leaning over the side in dozens &amp; every now &amp; again one would rush out from the mess room with an agonized look on his face straight for the rail.</p>
<p>Tuesday  The day was sunny but it rained at intervals during the day.  Will D was ill but fortunately</p>
