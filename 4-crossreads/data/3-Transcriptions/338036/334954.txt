<p>[23rd Sept. contd]<br/>camp &amp; dined rather well considering.  Just after dinner I counted 25 ships in the Channel and they say the "U" Boats are winning.  About 3 pm our lorries arrived &amp; we were soon on return journey.  Passing thro Wimereaux (it was Sunday &amp; the towns are looking their best) we came at length to Boulogne.  It was just like holiday time &amp; the dressing was quiet OK. A British band was playing at the beach and except for the fact that 'Kahki' &amp; blue were in evidence we would hardly realise a war was on.<br/>We arranged for the drivers to stop here an hour to give us a chance to look round and it was worth it.  The beach was very pebbly &amp; not up to the aust beaches.  We left Boulogne about 6 and when we arrived at Devres via Wisquenes [?] it was quite dark.  We pushed on after 10 minutes spell and arrived back at Ecurie about 9 pm.  The news on arrival was not too good as we were led to believe that the Division would be going back to lines again in a few days.</p>
