<p>1915 Sunday December 19<br/>As we evacuate the Peninsular tonight I may as well say so &amp; if Johnny Turk gets me I have sent my Diary by an officer to post who went last night &ndash; a jumble of notes written in odd places of our life here &ndash;<br/>I am one of the very last to leave this we consider a compliment &ndash; All my kit has gone, so if taken prisoner it will be cold &ndash; but we intend giving Abdul a good go for it &ndash; first &ndash; The boys are writing fare well messages to the Turks some are very amusing but there is a very sad side of the question which we all feel as we pass the graves of our mates. Tis true Tis pity &amp; pity tis tis true &ndash; Fleas bad</p>
