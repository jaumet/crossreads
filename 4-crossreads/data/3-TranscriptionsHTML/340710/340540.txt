<p><u>Midnight</u><br/>It is just midnight.  Before me bathed in soft moonlight stretch the green fields of France- the France untouched by the devastation of War-<br/>About 20 miles to the east an occasional flare fitfully illuminates the sky as if contesting the light of the moon, the dull rumble to thunder comes faintly across the fields breaking the gentle peacefulness of the countryside.  Far below on the right nestling in the valley the Somme's pale silver waters flow slowly towards the scene of war.  Across the Valley of the Somme the soft notes of a church-bell float up to me from the sleeping village of St Sauveur.<br/>What an exquisite peace.  I turn towards the west and think of England and of home and wonder</p>
