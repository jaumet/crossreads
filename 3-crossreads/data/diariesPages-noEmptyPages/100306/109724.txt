Gallwitz. Tr
26/2/17 caused annoyance. As the day went on the sun came out and observation good. It was hard to tell where the Germans were and where our people started. Lt. Smythe 24th took a patrol out of to Gamp trench and got in without loss except two corporals killed. He was supposed to establish a strong point here but did not do so. German guns were active but most shells went over beyond the rear. We could see a lot of Germans moving about all day. At 4.30 urgent message arrived by ?phone that we would attack Malt Tr. at 5.30pm and to come along for orders. Cull had already been out to reconnoitre and reported machine guns and a number of posts as well as very thick wire entanglements in front of this trench. He had a narrow escape of being made a prisoner. Orders arriving for this attack left us very little time so I anticipated orders by issuing others to have every one ready to go over the top. Went down to BattHQ under heavy fire across No Mans Land and there got detailed orders for this attack cooperating with the 5th Bde on right and the 21st on the left. Returned at once across No Mans Land
