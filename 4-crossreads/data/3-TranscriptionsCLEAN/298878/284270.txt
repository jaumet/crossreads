  
 Soon after sunset ten large French transports travelling "Line ahead", (which means on single file) could be seen travelling past Cape Hellis into the Dardanelles.  On the hills a shrapnel shell burst occasionally, and emitted a bright flash of light for about &#189; a second. Tuesday 27th April.  Desultry firing continued throughout the day; no news to relate.  Wednesday 28th April.   At 7.30am the Naval officer in charge of transports came alongside and ordered us to leave for Port Mudros; by 7.45am we were under way; this order occasioned no small amount of surprise, as we still had rations, ammunition, mules etc aboard, and the gunners ashore only had 3 days rations each with them.  As we steamed out of the bay we could see both fighting areas enshrouded in mist.  The sea perfectly smooth, sky blue and sun shining warmly presented an ideal morning.
