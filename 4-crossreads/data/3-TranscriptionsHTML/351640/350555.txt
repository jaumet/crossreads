<p>that the yellow metal was so common in the Commonwealth States that none need to have care in using it.  The same wonderment possesses the people of Cairo.  <strike>The guides</strike> In both cities the price of all things to the stranger were driven up, while even the residents had some complaints.  It may be the Cairoites speak in such manner as did Doctors &amp; others at the sea board, but I have not had time to find out their views.  I may do so some day.
