large number of Machines in this aerodrome. One Pilot was pointed out to me who had brought his 40th Machine down he was just over 20 years of age. After spending about 1  hours looking around I came back to Camp well pleased at what I saw. Sunday 24/6/17 After finishing at 1 am I went along to the trucks turned in, after sleeping for about 2 hours I was awakened by a lot of Fireing in the air, Fritz was about as it was a good Morning, clouds being scattered things were willing, he dropped several Bombs but did no damage also the big Gun started Fireing landed a shell in the Middle of the Station yard making a big hole in the Road way near some amunition trucks, my Chum who was on duty got a great scare as he was only about 20 yds off it, shunting on his Engine. Dirt Stones likewise shell was flying in all directions but no one was hurt, again Fritz came over at 10.30 am dropped a Bomb in a field about 100 yds from our trucks, Soldiers were running in all directions Bullets from our Aircraft guns were falling all
