for fresh fruit such as oranges tomatoes, we have tons of cold storage aboard, according to the Sgt we (Sgts mess) are to have fruit daily the Diggers twice weekly, all right if it comes off for everyone is more or less craving for fruit
After tea Braithwaite Modral I paid a visit to the engine room to have a look around, the firemen were drawing most of their fires for we are only going slow tonight so as we can reach Port Said by morning, we had a look round the dynamos, pumps, then went right along the enormous crankshaft almost to the propeller itself then up for a breath of fresh air for the atmosphere was very hot stifling, wouldn't take much of it to make me sick, wouldn't care for a job down there.
