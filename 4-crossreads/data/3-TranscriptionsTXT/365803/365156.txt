There were hardly any duck-boards left (these are the wooden footways raised above the mud), and two or three times I fell down holes three or four feet deep. Things were in a deuce of a mess there - parapets and dug-outs and everything mere heaps of earth. This was Ferguson's Company - his is now a Captain. The three officers with him were outed - one missing and two badly wounded, and he had about 24 men killed and 60 wounded."
Arthur's own account of this was: -
"My Company had a bit of a scrap the other night, which I pulled through with a practically whole skin and a little bumping.
