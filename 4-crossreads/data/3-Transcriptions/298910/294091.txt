<p>men with trench feet, the Doctors are trying hard to get not only a cure but a preventative for this painful complaint. Got a letter from Aunty Lyons.</p>
<p>17/11/16  Friday</p>
<p>Fine &ndash; but cold &ndash; nearly frozen. Very few wounded. A Taub last night treated us all in<br/>this vicinity to machine gun fire during the night. Glad to say one of airmen who was up got him, brought him down not far from here &amp; again we had the displeasure of dressing the occupant &amp; who in answer to why he had shelled etc our quarters, very profusely apologized &amp; said they thought it was an aerodrome. Heavy bombardment going on.</p>
<p>18/11/16  Saturday</p>
<p>About 3 inches of snow fell &ndash; started to rain about 10 am. Bitter cold. Very quiet &amp; very few wounded coming in.</p>
<p>19/11/16  Sunday</p>
<p>Drizzling rain &amp; very raw. At night we got a bit of a rush of patients &ndash; mostly sick &amp; trench feet, held for the night, will evacuate them early in the morning. General Birdwood</p>
