  
 motor cars through the street to the railway station en route for Sydney. We of course left the Victorians and the South Australians behind. Arrived in Sydney next morning about 10. oclock and were accorded another hearty welcome there and taken in cars to another Red Cross home. Left Sydney at 7. pm same day travelling all night had breakfast at Glen Innes and lunch at Wallan Garra. Changed trains there and travelled to Brisbane reaching there at 9. pm were given a splendid reception by the towns people. Motor cars to the Kangaroo Point Military Hospl. My nerves were in a somewhat damaged condition when the journey was ended and I went to bed on Saturday night and stayed in bed all day on Sunday On Monday I was "boarded" for discharge - on Tuesday I had to give evidence before the Pension Authorities and pass the Commonwealth Doctor and now the papers have gone to Melbourne to the Defence Dept. to be finally signed and then my discharge from the A.I.F. is complete. Am I glad? Am I sorry?
