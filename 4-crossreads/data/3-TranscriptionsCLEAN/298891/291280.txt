 16 Monday 
 Went on duty at 8 a.m. in dismal little gunyah & found tents as terrible as I expected. Spent day finding my way around and doing my best. Went to bed early. Jean Lindsay followed me from Salonique arriving at 2 a.m. Tuesday. Went to Serb class under charming young interpreter in evening.
