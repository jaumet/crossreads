<p>1918<br/>Thu 9th May (cont)<br/>After service we went to <u>the</u> hotel.   The cashier of the lager is also Mine Host of the village Hotel.   It is a comfortable old place  has a fine dance-room, horrible gilt mirrors &amp; a delightful old walled garden on the lake side full of apple &amp; pear trees in full blossom and some well grown old chestnuts.   The sort of place one would imagine as overflowing with cream and feather-beds, that hotel.</p>
<p>Fri. 10th.<br/>A hell of a row in the early a.m. between the Highly Respectable and Very Drunk.</p>
<p>The V.D. came through the "carpet" ordeal with flying colours owing to a little mistake on the part of the H.R.    Swimming commenced today.   The dressing rooms down among the lakeside villas are reserved for us daily from 2.15 p to 3.30 pm.</p>
