25/12/15Xmas Day. Foggy and chill in early morn but sunrise at 0900 was remarkably fine one golden beam of light making a shining pathway across the water to the East. The bulk of ships showed up distorted by the mist. At 1000 the Battalion turned out with the Engineers to Church parade. The men all cleaned wore cap and tunics breeches puttees & side arms and formed up in a hollow square.
Very pleasant in the warm sun. Most afterwards made for the beach armed with towels while others sat naked in the sun lousing themselves. Am still very lousy myself and look forward to a good hot bath if we strike a decent  boat en route to Egypt.
Xmas dinner in my tent. Padre Bennett, Major Smith & Mackay & Dr Drummond. Two kerosene boxes side by side served as a table and we squatted round on packs. Dinner consisted of stew plum pudding dates figs oranges and some sweets. After lunch I spent a half hour picking up the run of the mechanism of a Turkish rifle. They do away with the ejector screw by simply cutting away the cartridge causeway.
The sun continued warm after lunch so Major Conway Dr & I went down for a swim, soaped up well and after the dip sat down searching for lice. Continued further along the low stony beach the Aquitania is still here - rather a neat dodge making her a hospital ship to avoid her sharing the fate of the Lusitania. All the men in great heart now as merry as sandboys. Put a 17th. Bn man under arrest for fouling water reserve and sent him off under escort. Porter is acting R.S.M. think I will keep him on the job. He has a family and increase of pay means a lot to him. Mitchell my batman continues good and reliable and has now looked after me faithfully for 6 months. A shrewd head. Slept soundly and warm although the wet ground seems to send the cold up through groundsheet and blankets.
