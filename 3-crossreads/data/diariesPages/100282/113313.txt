out of the mud, the men are not half cursing it either.
4th Capt Whitby got up at 5.30 this morning to go with the other Coy. Commanders to have a look at the trenches we are going to take over from the 3rd Bde. He reckons at the present time it is very quiet the Battalions at present holding it have had only 1 or 2 casualities since they have been in there.
A couple of nights ago old Fritz attacked took a little "outpost" off the 9th but they drove him out immediately, but he came again retook it, then the 9th drove him out again held it during this little scrap one of the 9ths runners got taken prisoner twice, but the Huns could not get him away, the second time he was handing his things over to them, he pulls out a Mills bomb jerks the pin out slings it among the mob, just for companys sake, at the same time he makes a bold rush for our lines, got there safely with nothing worse than a bullet
