<p>Jany 1917<br/>4th/14 &ndash; L.H. held them up. Directly they came in touch the 4000 "dug in" &amp; entrenched. They reckon if they had had another reg't to get round them they would have surrendered, such is their morale. Shows what ours <u>is</u>. Report says that when the German officer got his behind kicked, a Turk rushed up &amp; offered to cut his throat. Report also says that the German's oppression of the Turks, makes them so willing to surrender. Subm. Busy off Port Said, Russian T.B. torpedoed &amp; the "Ben McCrae" <strike>aeroplane</strike> sea-plane ship also torpedoed off El Arish. The "Ivernia" a Cunard Liner of 14 000 tons, a transport sunk in Mediterranean about 170 troops missing. Sgt Sim overdue his leave. Some speculation as to whether he was aboard. Do not think so as I don't think he had any intentions of returning. Bob T. rejoined unit. Aust mail (letters) in on 12th<br/>14/22nd &ndash; Lt Col Croll &amp; Cox left Hassaniya for Hsptl T'port "Euriposes" enroute to Aust. Sent small pcl with Cox for Molly. Lyons from K139 also going. Col. gave farewell speech, usual sayings, not a brilliant orator (?) Surprised when he personally called to say "G.bye" His successor not yet appointed. Three in running Lt Col Fraser, major White (3rd INFA) &amp; a chap from England. Tipping &amp; hoping Lt Col Fraser gets it. Lt Col Fraser said conditions of country at El Arish much the same but 20m. beyond its mostly cultivated. Rotten winds &amp; sand again. Hills form &amp; disappear or alter shapes within course of a day or so. Sent films by reg'd mail to Molly, about 120 of them. Frequent rumours of a move to El Arish. Expect to move in about a fortnight or so. Nothing doing out El Arish. Reconnaisance stunts only. Waiting for rly &amp; a viaduct</p>
