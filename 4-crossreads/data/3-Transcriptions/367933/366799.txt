<p>"B"<br/>Extract from letter from the Defence Department dated 25.9.16</p>
<p>"The minister having approved of the principle of establishing Battalion Comforts Funds, it would appear to be desirable for the Executive of the Australian Comforts Fund to issue suitable instructions for the guidance of such Funds in regard to their proper functions. Senator Pearce is confident that due consideration in this connection would be given by your committee to the desirableness of encouraging the Battalion Comforts Funds to provide meeting places for those who have relations at the Front, and who naturally are drawn together in the common desire to obtain news of those near and dear to them. The minister feels that there is a great avenue of wholesome operation for the Australian Comforts Funds through the Battalion Comforts Funds in providing the facilities in this regard, and trust that your Executive will by this means do much in the direction of obviating that heaviness of heart and depression of spirit to whic the female nature is so prone in lonely hours of anxiety and trouble. To this end it is felt that your Executive should through the parent organisation in each State, take the initiative in forming Battalion Comforts Funds, and encourage their operations as subdivisions of the A.C.F. Administration."</p>
