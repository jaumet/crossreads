Dear Sir
No doubt you have long since heard that 2nd Lieut. F.S. Phillips is missing and as he was one of my officers I want to give you the sympathy of myself and officers.
Lieut. Phillips went over in the charge in our attack on the German trenches on the night 4/5th Nov. and was not seen again.  The attack failed and as the Germans were seen bandaging and removing wounded from the front of their trenches, there is a chance that he is a prisoner.  If so you will probably hear from him before long.
Lieut. Phillips was only with me for a short time, but in that time proved himself a hardworking, painstaking and courageous officer and a great loss to us.  It was thro his zeal he went over in the attack as he should have remained in the trenches, and I hope sincerely that although the hope is small that he will be spared to return to you.
