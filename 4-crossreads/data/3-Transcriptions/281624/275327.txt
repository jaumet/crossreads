<p>In wishing you greetings of the coming New Year<br/>I wish you all joys and I wish you good cheer<br/>And as years roll on you will never falter<br/>To remember your patients at Xmas in Malta</p>
<p>When war &amp; grief are over<br/>And there are smiles instead of tears<br/>And you are in dear old Ireland<br/>In happy future years<br/>I wonder if you will think Sister<br/>Of Malta nursing times<br/>And those awful Australian Patients<br/>And the one that scribbled Rhymes.</p>
