 to-night the Phosphorus has been very prevalent in the water. The last few night the southern cross was to be seen very low down on the horizon in a Southerly direction. 
 On Friday the 23rd we were well out in the Indian Ocean, The sea is very choppy and a lot of the men have been seasick, I am alright myself but there is a lot more men on board, that look as if it would be a great relief to them if they could only be sick. 
 We have kept land in sight from early morning until afternoon. The land was the North-east coast of Africa and it was on our Starboard side. 
 At about three Pm we passed a small island on our Port side. 
 Flying fish have been about in large numbers, we have passed through shoals of them. Porpoises also have been constantly ahead of the ship.
