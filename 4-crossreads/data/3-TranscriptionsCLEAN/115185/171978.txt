2 - would have rather had a general medical or surgical ward - but this special work has turned out to be perhaps the most important and vast work amongst the soldiers restant in Egypt. The climate being especialy bad for eyes ears noses & throats - and I have more cases than any other sister in the hospital. The Major, is I should think a man of 55 to 60 - and I find I can be of use to him in many ways. He leaves all the running of the ward to me - etc. Don't say I said this, for people are fearfully jealous. I only write these things for you. I can't quite understand my being given this position as he is a Queenslander and there are lots of his own nurses here. But I think he asked for me - from what I hear - this is entre-nous - I get a great deal of courtesy and help from the orderlies - and block-masters who are sergeants & Staff sergeants. I have three other sisters - (Staff - nurses)
