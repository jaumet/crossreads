9/10/17 Broodseinde
Young Dooley was hit on the tapes but refused attention. Skene Smith badly wounded was left in a shell hole and old Jack Campbell was killed. The two Vickers guns were knocked out. A good many dead. A Company of the 48th. now came in (10p.m.) and relieving us commenced. It is strange how silently men die. A chap goes out in the dark and nothing is ever known until he is found lying there. In the dark one treads on them. Delighted to hear that Bunning is O.K. he has had a devilish time the last few days. The mud just now is beyond words in our communication trench it is up to the crutch. Bloodstained rattled and stupefied some men are a little deranged and speak strangely of shells shelling. Our battalion strength now down to 60 and good Australian boys lie dead and stiff on the ground with mud in their hair and blood on them. A dreadful game.
