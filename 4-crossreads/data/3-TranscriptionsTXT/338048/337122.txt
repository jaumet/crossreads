 Spent evening in chatting with the Tommies with whom we are doing well. 
 Saturday 5th 5 am again &amp; stables after it. Spent the morning with a cable drill and had a good time when an officer personally explained things on the wagon to another chap &amp; myself. He was a bit a dandy but we seem to "get" them all right On marching back to our tents which are &frac12; mile from where we drill to, I got a mail of four letters &amp; then prepared for leave to Bedford 6 miles away. 
 Immediately after  tea  dinner we set off and were taken in by a military motor wagon. The River Ouse flows through there &amp; is very pretty &amp; provides good boating of which we partook. We had tea there walking about to see the place &amp; caught a drag about 11 p.m. home. There was a decent crowd of us and so were had a good sing-song all the way home.
