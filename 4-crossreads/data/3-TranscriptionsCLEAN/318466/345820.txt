  
 Sunday 25 August 1918 Packed up in the morng.  Went into Havre - met Miss Irwin & came back to tea at 40th Stat.  Caught six o'c train up to the Line.  Played Bridge on the trip. 
 Monday 26 August 1918 Arrived Corbie at about 8 a.m. & walked out to Rein. Camp with Mehan.  Met Capt. Gilchrist & Col. Bennett out there.  Hear that the Div. is to do a hop over in the morng. 
 Tuesday 27 August 1918 Got up early but did not move forward until after lunch.  Had a long march to the Transport line over old Boche ground.  Slept in a tent & it rained. 
 Wednesday 28 August 1918 Pitt & a few others came along from the Bn. to a school.  I went forward & joined the Bn. & was sent to C Coy. 
 Thursday 29 August 1918 Had orders to move at 10.30 & went forward - the Hun having gone further back.  Spent a very cold & draughty night near Estree.  Ground shows much sign of Hun retreat. 
 Friday 30 August 1918 Moved nearer Peronne in the early morning.  The news is still good - that he has gone still further back.  We were shelled out of our original position & moved to quieter quarters. 
 Saturday 31 August 1918 Moved round N of Peronne & crossed the Somme in the evening.  Went up to some old French trenches for night.  Saw Kernaghan & he got whacked a minute or so after. Marched further during the past three days than ever I've done in France!!  Jerry  can  move.
