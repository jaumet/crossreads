had a good time.  I was surprised at your going but hope it did you good & set you up.
You were having a rotten time before.  The mails are still quite mad & several of your letters & Mother's too I haven't had yet.
Well I must flee & go to bunk.  The bung bungs are starting & they are not conducive to good or intelligent writing.  I saw a Tank.  My dear they are weird quite the ugliest thing I've ever seen & they look so alive & sort of intelligent but in a slow & dogged & purposeful way.  Crash & very nice too.
Good nightMuch loveJames
