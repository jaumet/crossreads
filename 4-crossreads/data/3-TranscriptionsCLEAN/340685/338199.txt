Ford Sterling & Billie Ritchie & then a very fine tragic drama. Had to leave a bit early to see the wagons safely away & we followed them up on our bikes reloading if anything fell off. part of the load going to Croix Marshal & part here to Elbow Corner. bed about 10 very tired. While I was away a billet was shelled called the Spy House by us on account of the crusty nature of the owners & there was 47 casualties by one shell. Found a german nose cap of a shell marked 4.6.16 they tell me.22.6.16 On the trenches again to-day with a very hard working chap. Very hard work to me shovelling & driving in pickets & blistered my hands and got a bit out of breath. Party of infantry working for us. plenty of tobacco on hand. Gas alarm at night but nothing occurred.23.6.16 Only 7 of us working here to dig & no one in charge so we took things pretty easy in fact loafed. Did a bit of wire netting revetting. German artillery active all the afternoon as it looked like rain and wet ground makes shells do less damage. Just as I was sitting down to tea - Daly had gone to Sailly it started to pour and very soon our dug out was leaking torrents through the joints of the galvanised iron roof and I had to use our dixies to partly protect our beds. Wet bed to lie in that night but they soon dried up again. That evening our artillery tried to revenge but of course the effect wasn't so great.24.6.16 very very sloppy this morning and we had a party of infantry working for us and the clay stuck to everything. However, we kept going all day. The germans shelled our support and front line trenches and of course we shelled back and considerable damage was done on both sides. Things being pretty war. Bed early and gas attack at night which however didn't come our way.25.6.16 Sunday issue of 2 oz tobacco & packet of cigarettes and 2 boxes matches. Party of about 80 infantry of the 2nd battalion who have just come in from 16 days in the trenches. Work from about 8.30 to 12 & 1.30 to 4. Very interesting directing their efforts, and our work is going on well. Part of the line where we are is in the form of a horse shoe a rather dangerous salient as if the germans broke through the neck we  would be surrounded. However the place is thickly studded with artillery and our work is to form redoubts of about an 2 acres in extent in the form of a square protected by barb wire and a fire trench right round and numerous dugouts. Th trees right round us and shrubs &  we are well concealed at Elbow Farm. On the North corner is the farm which was shelled just before we arrived here. Another redoubt is being made
