<p>Friday 29 March<br/>Good Friday.  Wet. Last night Fritz shelled about here fairly heavily catching a battery.  We had two trips out &amp; much gas was in evidence.</p>
<p>Saturday 30 March<br/>Wet &amp; miserable to-day but still very quiet on the front.  A German airman very daringly came very low over our lines &amp; escaped scot free. News from the Somme still disconcerting &amp; the advance is in one place 25 miles deep &amp; in another 15 miles from Amiens.</p>
