 (A Child's Shoe) 
 =====  "  =====   "   ===== 
 Mute "pathetic relic" from out the peaceful past 
 What memories awaken, of the one who wore thee last 
 'Round you my vagrant fancy, a story sad doth weave 
 For a little kiddie owned you, 'Tis easy to perceive 
 Just a baby's tiny slipper, lying all forlorn 
 Amid the scattered debris, that was once a happy home 
 Yet you speak of tears and laughter, baby prattle, mother's love 
 While you shriek aloud for vengeance to  He  who dwells Above
