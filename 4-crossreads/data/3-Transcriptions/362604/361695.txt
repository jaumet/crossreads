<p>for Breakfast.  Roast mutton, Baked Potatoes &amp; cabbage, bread, tea, plum pudding &amp; Brandy Sauce for Dinner &amp; cold meat &amp; radishes, lettuce, bread, butter &amp; melon jam or Honey or Golden Syrup &amp; Tea for Tea &amp; supper if one likes to go up for it.  This is only a very ordinary day &amp; we do better sometimes.  So don't worry about our meals &amp; I might state that they are beautifully cooked &amp; of course a Sergeant's mess is quite a respectable place.  Well, Best of Luck &amp; lots of Love.  Be Happy for we haven't a care.  If you saw Dick &amp; Ellis &amp; I dragging one another out of bed &amp; pillow fighting &amp; larking about, you would not worry at all.  Longing, longing for one another is the only sadness &amp; unhappy part.  Cheerio,</p>
