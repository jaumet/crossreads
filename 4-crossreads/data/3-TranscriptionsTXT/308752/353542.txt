The journey was cold & a miserable one. There were about thirty men to a truck so you can imagine the enormous amount of room we had to move about. Every one was more than pleased when the train journey ended. The place where we detrained was a fair size city & troops could be seen in all directions. Here our packs are placed in a lorry to be carried as we have a long march in front of us. The march was rather a severe one, the distance was 12 1/2 kilos., & it absolutely poured in torrents all the time we were on the road.  It was close on 6 p.m. when we arrived at our destination which turned out to be a fine chateau. Our cooks had gone on ahead & prepared a hot meal for the Unit, & you can bet that we all did good justice to it. Shortly after tea every one turned in, all were very tired as we had had a fairly heavy day.
Thursday 29th. March, 1918.
I thoroughly enjoyed the sleep & awoke in the morning very much refreshed. Nothing doing during the day, every one having a rest, as any moment we were receiving orders, & probably we will have some stiff marches in front of us.Who should I meet to-day but Roy Watkins, he was looking very well.
Friday March 30th 1918 - 7th of April.
Moving orders again - fall in at 8 o'clock & march to ---- the next village, only two kilos away.  It was certainly a miserable kind of village. The Unit are distributed  all over the place, the majority living in barns.  The Orderly Room is in an old stable. The mud & slush about the place is awful, so the sooner we leave the "enticing" place, the better I will like it.
