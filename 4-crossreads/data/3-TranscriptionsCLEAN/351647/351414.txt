  
 our crowd. 
 I wonder how you are of course we haven't had a mail for 5 or 6 weeks & everybody is going stark staring mad over it. 
 I sent you a scarf, hope you don't mind, I rather liked the colour, it may go with one of your frocks. 
 I saw a great thing in Maid of the Mountains, a dress of dull gold tissue & lined with either old rose (or deep salmon, I couldn't quite make out which) but watching it was like listening to delicious music or drinking nice champagne on a hot day. 
 I must flee really.  I hope things are good.  I'll write again quite soon. 
 Neil Brown (Fanny Louisa's nephew) is here & doesn't he love her. 
 Pleasant domestic picture, 6 men in various stages of undress grouped round a fire & various  fires  lights round them.  And what are these men doing?  Only chatting. 
 After that, good night.  Love to Graham, the Boss & Mac, also Mrs. Ellis. 
 Yours Wilkie
