Sunday 2nd
As usual just as we have our camp nice and comfortable we get orders to move again. No time for Church Parade to-day, its "all hand on deck" taking down tents and loading our stores to go out to the Road Head and join up with the 8th Brigade Battalionss, who are already camped out there. I was one of a stretcher squad told off to carry our few remaining patients over to the 15th F. Amb. after this we struck tents and loaded them on the waggons. Jack Fallon had a film, so we had a few snapshots taken, one of us preparing for the march. We left about 5.30 and arrived at Rail Head about 7. We bivouacked here for the night, out in the open. We were jolly tired and all of us slept soundly. Even the crowd in the Arabs camp failed to keep us awake, although they were howling pretty well all night.
Monday 3rd
I was told off as Picket from 10 till 12, and was jolly glad when it was over, so that I could get back to my bunk again.
Another busy day sorting out tents and stores. A.Section are to go with the 31 and 32 Batts. who are camped a few miles away from the 29th and 30th, to whom we are to be attached. We had everything finished by midday, but did not start on the march till after tea, as it was so bloomin? hot. Besides our full marching kit we had to carry our own blankets, as there was not any room for them on the waggons. This is the first time the two sections have been separated since the 8th has been formed. Major Newell went with A.Section, and Major Willliams came with us. It was only about 3 miles to our destination, but we were all jolly glad to get there as we have done so much marching lately.
