Weather very warm and close with a very hot sun. After lunch went to Albert  which is quite transformed since becoming Army Headquarters. The place has been cleaned up and some civilians have returned. A motor water-cart driven by 4 Tommies was watering the road in front of Army H.Q.!! The way the English luxuriously run this war deserves them to lose it. Bathed and bought some things at the Officers Clothing store and at the GFC. Then to afternoon tea and met Major Murray V.C. D.S.O. a nice chap. Some of the younger officers we see nowadays are much below the standard of the past. Rumors that we move up again soon and that 4th Div are going to 2nd Anzac and up north. Rode home through green leafy roads. Becourt Wood in good leaf. Found Bob Holland at the camp & he messed with us. Then walked over to his camp.
