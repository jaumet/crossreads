It was also in this camp where we spent our Xmas & considering the circs we had a very decent time. Boxing morning the 26th was detailed in charge of a fatigue party & went up to Wytschaete village on road making. Next day I went with an officer & N.C.Os & had a good look round the Front line, Supports & reserve trench which was to be our home for a few days. On the 30th I came a big thud for I was detailed as platoon advance guard & had to go to the front line & have a look at platoon sector & also went out on patrol & next morning came back to Wytschaete village & made a big fire & thawed myself. I met my platoon that same night & guided them into the front line & took over. Our position here was on the outpost scheme with piquet line, supports, reserves etc & no movement whatever could be made whatever. On the night of the  1st January I was detailed in charge of wiring party in no man land & did a few hours work. Next night the 2nd we changed over & we moved back to support where we had to do fatigue etc & we lasted there for three days. We again moved & changed over with the front line on the night of the 5th.
