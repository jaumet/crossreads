 Dear Mr. Fry Many thanks for your kind letter of sympathy It was most stupid of me to have come that buster but it will at any rate have enlarged your experience, as you mentioned to me the evening of my accident that you had never met any one who had actually broken a bone at a rink. With kind remembrances to your wife and yourself 
 I am yours very sincerely J. W. Edgeworth David
