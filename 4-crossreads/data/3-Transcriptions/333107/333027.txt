<p>Sun. Apr. 14th<br/>War news look a bit bright and this morning we are holding Fritz back, but the casualties on both sides must be enormous.</p>
<p>George Lawson, the Billiard marker, finished up at his job today, had a few words with the "Food Controller". He and I went into Warminster after Dinner. The Depot Band was playing at the Town Hall, and tho' it was bitterly cold a good crowd gathered to listen to the Music. We had some Biscuits and Tea at the new "Y.M." went for a stroll and had some more Tea and Sandwiches at the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Then we went to the Methodist Church. It was quite homely and I enjoyed it much better than "the Minster" services.</p>
<p>Sun 14 (cont)</p>
<p>After the Service we attended a Sing-Song in the School-Room. I met Sgt Matheson there.</p>
<p>A number of Ladies were present and handed round Tea and Cakes. They gave us an invitation to attend a Social on Tuesday night, but I won't be able to go as I shall be working.</p>
<p>Returned to Camp about 9.30.</p>
<p>Com. Letter 19 to B.E.</p>
<p>Mon. Apr. 15<br/>Wet, miserable day.</p>
<p>Arthur Foster is crook and the M.O. marked him "no duty". "Toby" Nicholson is carrying on his Job.</p>
