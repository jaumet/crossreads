of the noise ? a useful lesson in this. We could not talk at all till the sigs. swathed my head and the phone too in blankets to deaden the sound. 2 killed 6 wounded. Buried the two dead in 1 grave all inside an hour ? so close are life and death here. Some badly wounded ? hands off etc. Very nasty comments going round about the class of Tommies at Suvla Bay. Royal Marine Light Infantry when holding these trenches here shot their own Colonel. Slush lamps now in vogue ? tobacco tin full of fat and a wick of flannel or rope they stink dreadfully. A lovely moonlight night. This morning from our little secret observation post with telescope I could see a turband Turk mules passing to and fro also other traffic in groups. All day and all night we have shifts of "miners" working away in the bowels of the earth
