  
 cultivation & it is nearly impossible to do any work without spoiling something or other, but such is the fortune of war. They are getting our band together again so we will be alright for route marche's the 3rd Battalion have theirs going already, I heard it early this morning & very nice it sounded in the crisp air. Yesterday afternoon while we were practicing rapid loading with live ammunition, a chap in our section accidentally let his rifle off but luckily no-one was hit, the same chap also stuck his bayonet in his leg pretty deep, which made the blood flow pretty fast, a stab from a bayonet is a pretty painful thing as I can testify for I done the same thing myself at Mena when we were there.
