1d each for a large Mug of Tea sat down finished our Tea, the whole lot costing us 3 francs 5d each, Anyhow that is the last time I intend having Tea in Poperinghe. The style there does not suit me. After a quiet stroll until 8 Pm we started on our return journey, but tried another Road, we followed a Train line along a narrow street walking along the sides on a pathway of ashes it turned into a wide road although the Traffic there is also Heavy one could walk along in comfort, we kept going for about 1 mile eventually arrived at a point where the line crosses our line we turned followed our line into Camp although it is a little farther but still when the roads are bad it is the best. After getting into Camp we made ourselves a cup of cocoa each having some of the Ginger Cake left we had a nice supper, eventually turned into bed. We had only been in bed a few minutes when an alarm was given of Gas, the Hooters Engine Whistles Bells ringing soon aroused every body, the alarm is for all hands to be on the alert, that is place our Gas respirators on our chest, opened ready to put the mask
