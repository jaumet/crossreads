Took a walk round and found works nearly complete men quite out of sight in some places 10 feet down, the whole place a mass of zig?zag intricate burrows. At 4.30 every man stood to arms and remained under arms in his allotted position with bayonets c fixed until dawn. Inspected some picks and found them quite bent up and useless through work in sandstone and shale. 
At 6 issued rations and formed up. Found that horses had broken away so led column in on foot. Very hot walk all clothes saturated. Shower Mail to hand 4 letters ? no news. Busy morning with correspondence. Talk of a raid in Cairo tonight. No pay to be issued until Monday - Bdiers order.
