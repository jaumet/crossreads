<p>there until 5-15 Pm when we said Good Bye &amp; both went along to the Tivoli Theatre &amp; had to take our turn outside, forming up two deep on the footpath.    At 5-30 Pm the Doors opened &amp; in we went, they charged us 50 cents each (5d) &amp; we both got a good seat in the Gallery.   At 6 Pm the Orchestra opened with a March played by a Brass Band of 26 players &amp; it was a great treat to listen to.   They received a good cheer after they had finished.   By this time the House was packed &amp; a first Class show was put on.   There were several good singers &amp; they all received an encore.   One turn was a knock out.   The Artist was dressed as a clown &amp; he had several Dummy Instruments &amp; made the sound by his mouth, the first was a Banjo Selections &amp; he would play on imaginary strings for a while &amp; then he would scratch his leg, all the time the Banjo would appear to be playing.   When the boys found out that he was making the sound by his mouth, it caused a great laughter.  The Violin &amp; Whistle, likewise also brought down the house, &amp; the Artist was encored several times.  This turn was the best imitation of Musical Instruments I have ever seen.  The show did not finish until 8-15 Pm so we could not have our usual glass of ale going home.</p>
