<p>Wednesday, 28 April, 1915<br/>Cleaned saddlery in the morning, inspection in p.m then fatigues.</p>
<p>The Aust are in action now under Sir Ian Hamilton the Allied troops have landed in three places, it is reported that the Austs landed under heavy fire and that there are heavy casualties, the wounded are expected here to-morrow so I will hear more.</p>
<p>In spite of the losses the Allies have gained a lot of ground inland capturing some good positions so there is a possible chance for us going after all.</p>
<p>Thursday, 29 April, 1915<br/>Train loads of wounded arrived here all day (Palace H) from Gallipoli they report heavy casualties amongst  the Aust all these however are of the 3rd Brigade Inf and the 3rd Field Ambulance.  They say that out of a Batt of men only 300 odd answered the roll whilst the Ambulance was completely cut up, the Turks simply ignoring it when they went to pick up the wounded.</p>
<p>3000 British losses are reported but as they are invading it must be expected, will have more to chronicle to-morrow.  The hospital staff is doing great work at the Palace Hotel &amp; Luna Park.</p>
