  
 our wet & sodden clothes on, had a scramble for breakfast & pushed off again we had not far to walk & we caught the train & got into open trucks which took us and the 12 th Bn. down to Meaulte. By Jove I was crook didn't give a cuss what happened, we dumped our packs here & marched away to Ribemont & just about crawled into her dead beat, we reached our billets and turned in at once 9 th. This morning we marched to Heilly & had a beautiful hot bath - what a relief it was to get our chatty clothes off & into new ones  we felt like new men once more, the NCOs had a separate place set apart for them here we had our bath in big wooden tubs, & afterwards we all got a complete change of clothes  socks underpants & shirts.
