 Reveille at 5.30 Made up my mind to go to church this morning so Bobby and I went, the service was good & the news from the Dardanelles was thrilling but our chaps seem to have been rather venturesome.  in the afternoon I got all my correspondence up to date.  We hear that mail is due tomorrow so am looking forward to it anxiously for news from home & Nell.  Toby got rid of his machine today & is now the richer by a checqe of  50.  British regulars are arriving here (wounded) from the front, the French have captured Chanak on the opposite side of the Narrows.
