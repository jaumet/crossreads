8th continued  blankets & gave me a slight scratch on the left hand, but I fixed it up with a piece of sticking plaster & have said nothing about it.9th   I have had influenza for the last two days & have been "off duty" to-day.  I got a slight "shell shock" last night & have not been feeling too "fit."  Grace got it bad & was sent off to hospital with the others.  Fritz has been sending over a few more of his H.Es. to-night & has got some of the pioneers who are about 100 yds. behind us.
