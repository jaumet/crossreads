<p>Monday 10 September 1917<br/>Duty 7 a.m. E Wards</p>
<p>Monday 9th [September] 1918<br/>One year ago &amp; yet how things have changed.  A year in Egypt has taught me much &amp; what we as a family have suffered through the fault of one.  Often I feel that it must all be a dream &amp; that the little girl could never behave as she has done.</p>
