have been there for quite a long while now with the result that they are as brazen & cheeky as one could possibly imagine.  It is very amusing nevertheless to hear the boys talking to these market-people and to hear their replies, some of which, I might add, are by no means choice.    It pains my heart to think that Any of Australia's Sons should come away over here to fight for Right etc. & yet to spend their time teaching these helpless ones all the filth that they know.   Who is in fault I can scarcely say.    However, some of the post-cards which I have sent home, came from this market.
May 10.    Dental Parade in morning.   Alan & Norman came from England to Etaples to-day.
May 11.   Dental Parade again.   A fairly good concert was given by the "Tommies" in our mess-hut this evening.
