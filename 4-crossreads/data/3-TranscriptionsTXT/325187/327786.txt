 We asked some of the  Welch  Welsh Officers to Mess last night as a rule we get on  well with  the Regular Officers  [Following paragraph is  crossed out] but the very fresh Kitcheners Army Officers are a supercilious lot &amp; look upon us as "Beastly Colonials", of course our men do SKITE a bit &amp; our Officers are not all one could always wish but alongside the Tommy counter jumper we can hold our own.  They never speak to us in Tram or Train &amp; I suppose when the war is over would not recognise us at all Why do so many of our young men go to England to join Regiments aren't the Australian forces good enough I wonder?
