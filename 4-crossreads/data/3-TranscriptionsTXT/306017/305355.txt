August 1916There was a good hot meal waiting us when we got back &amp; we were not long turning in.  There was a lot to do in camp next day, states of men horses &amp; equipment had to go in, burial parties organised etc.  I was still fairly tired all day.  The horses still look a bit the worse for wear.  Heavy fighting went on all day.  Some of the fresher mounted  troops &amp; a lot of British infantry were engaged.
August 6th to 9thWe had a quiet spell in camp, with the exception of a few enemy planes with bombs there was no excitement.  Our horses are getting stronger fast.  On Tuesday [8th] the strongest horses &amp; men of each regiment marched out at 3 pm reached Katia before dark watered &amp; had tea &amp; pushed on.  The funny part of it was that Tommies along the route said to us, You have missed the fun  Hurry up &amp; get in for your cut.  We have given them hell, etc.We rode all night
