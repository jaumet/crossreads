  
 1/2/16 Intended to leave for Ismailia at daylight but though wakened early by Spendlove it was after 0700 before I set out. A delightful cool morning and very pleasant riding along. Had to trust entirely to a small compass to find the way. Constant reference to this was necessary or one would be going in a circle. One sandhill resembles another so closely that landmarks cannot be picked up. 
 Steering due West missed Railhead though the sound of camel drivers voices could be heard in the distance. Came in sight of Roadhead which contains a big native camp - all colours and races. About 100 camels being fed and watered. Soudanese troopers with their legs ornamented by a small puffy ball - big black chaps. A good deal of transport mostly N.Z. on the road carrying supplies. The rattle of the dredges became louder on nearing Staging Camp and pulled up at the Transport where Bird came out. Horse sweating a good deal. 
 Stabled horse and with Bird went into Ismailia taking two orderlies and a Maltese cart. Engineers very busy round canal and singing gangs of natives at work. (Ismn, come here, ou-ah git out of the way, awas. Cam how much, ouah riglah look out 'mind your feet'). Round the shops and bought some officers mess stuff and then to railway station to send cables. All native clerks busy at telegraph instruments and all of the washed out enervated appearance. Most favour long greatcoats with collars turned down over European clothes.
