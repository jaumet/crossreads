We repulsed him with heavy loss, the whole ridge to our right being covered with Germans in disorder. The 17th & 19 then held the front line while the 20th  fell back into a communication trench to meet another counter attack. He did not force an assault & that finished the contact:We bobbed off about 4 a.m. & won our objective at 10 a.m. on the 31st, we remained there all day, & all night, & withdrew on 1st Sept.
