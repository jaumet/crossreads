<p>Angel Hotel Liverpool letterhead<br/>Bulford<br/>2/8/17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>I am not on my way to the Island again as you may be apt to think from this paper.  But I expect that I will have been to see Auntie again by the time you receive this.  Im trying for longer leave this time.  I guess that we will not know the place when we return after so many improvements.  I suppose by the time you get this letter that you will be able to sit under the shade of some of the fruit trees.  I am enclosing a few seeds of a Blue Jackeranda Tree that I got in Egypt.  I do not suppose that the seeds will be any good now.  You might give them a try anyway.  I am not likely to be made a Sergeant</p>
