<p>There is no doubt that we have had a rotten spin of it since we left the regiment, we have been in this camp about a fortnight now &amp; we have been stone broke all the time, &amp; what hurts most their are plenty of canteens, with nearly every thing you can think of for sale.</p>
<p>Do you know that we never recieved any gift stuff or Xmas Billies for Xmas &amp; yet you hear the tale over home their, that every Australian in Egypt gets a Xmas Billie at Xmas, but I can assure you we recieved nothing at all, but never mind I sincerely hope that the war is finished long before next Xmas &amp; that we are all home again, but it doesen't look much like finishing just at present, the way things have been going on other fronts. We have given Jacko a great tickling here.</p>
<p>I bought a pound of Australian butter just before I whent broke, &amp; do you know that I never enjoyed anything so much in all my life before, it was simply lovely. I had not tasted any since I left Australia. This is the best camp I have been in since I joined the army, plenty of good tucker, go to bed when you like &amp; get up when you like &amp; nothing to do, only you are glad to get up as the ground gets very hard &amp; cold with only an oil sheet under you. The natives say that January is the wettest &amp; coldest month here I fairly dread it comming after what we have had already.</p>
<p>I have had no mail or parcels yet. Well I think that I have told you all the news for this time. Remember me to all my friends, give my love to Olive &amp; tell her I will drop her a card when I get one. I hope that Nell has been over with you long before this. Kind regards to the Boss. Good Bye for the Present. Remember me to Dolly &amp; Mabel also Mrs. Logie &amp; Swains.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your ever Loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>Kisses for You<br/>X X X X X X<br/>X X X X X X<br/>X X X X X X</p>
