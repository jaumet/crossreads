<p>March.<br/>Wednesday, 1.<br/>Jerks (first parade) and footdrill morning. Usual leave (Wed. and Sat. afternoons) from 2 p.m. Went with N. and G. to Native Bazaars, (Egyptian and Arab) Blue Mosque, and also another Mosque nearby. Beautiful marble mosaic, lapis lazuli etc. Bought a black and gold table centre for 100 piastres. They wanted 250 for it. Struck a nice place in Khan Khalil, a French and a Russian girl there, and had good time trying to speak French. Went with N. and G. to French brothel---50 piastre place, at north-west end of Bulac Shareh. We refused their overtures but shouted drinks which cost us 55 piastree We spent half an hour chatting till a well-dressed native came in when the ladies immediately flocked to him.</p>
<p>Thursday, 2.<br/>Jerks and drill morning. Heavy dust storm, so no parade in afternoon. Went in with Bob M. in evening. Indigestion and liver victim---late when we got to town, poor companion---so not particularly enjoyable evening. Left by 9.15 train for Camp. Station Helmieh.</p>
