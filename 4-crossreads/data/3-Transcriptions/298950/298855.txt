<p>to desert.  June 18.  About 8 p.m. we heard 2 shots fired by the Sentry stationed in ,,Luna Park" a Excercise guard during day time but closed at 6 p.m. daily  After about 10 minutes the searchlight of the Observation Tower came in operation, &amp; shining in the direction of shots fired.  We all thought someone had escaped, but fancy our suprise when we seen two young Bulls about 20 yards away from the Sentry quitly grazing.  The Soldier taking them for escaping Internees.  How the Bulls got inside of the Excercise ground is still a mistery.  June 19th.  A Internee named Jackel recieved 12 months jail without hard labor for trying to escape.</p>
