4.4.16 TuesdayThe day turned out very warm & sultry.  Had a fairly busy time with Transport.I went up to Heliopolis this evening with our Postal Staff Sergt & sat on the Piazza of the Heliopolis House, watching the Pictures & regaling myself in between times.  It reminded me very forcibly of the times I used to go down to Fairfield Show for the usual Hang over with you all, only that it is free here, not even the customary 3d piece being charged.This place looks deserted now, as all the Australians are down the Canal & in France.The English tommies are coming in like flies & the same transports take our boys away.We are now the only Australians in this part of Egypt.
