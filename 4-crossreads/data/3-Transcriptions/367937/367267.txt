<p>16th August 1916</p>
<p>My dear Mother<br/>I wrote to Father a couple of days ago but am going to write to you now to reply to three letters from home which I got last night after not getting any for nearly three weeks so you can imagine my joy at getting 18 in eighteen in one bunch.<br/>The dates of the letters are 6th June; 5th July &amp; 8th July and one from Father 8th June.<br/>Father had a great trip when taking delivery of the Car.  I am glad he has got it &ndash; it will do you such a lot of good to be often out &amp; it is jolly nice to be able to talk about "Our car" over here.<br/>The silk shirts have not arrived yet but I'm expecting them any day:  about sending parcels &ndash; there is a YMCA canteen here but it is always in a cronic state of sold outedness and when there is anything in you are not allowed to spend more than 1/- on any one thing to make stuff go</p>
