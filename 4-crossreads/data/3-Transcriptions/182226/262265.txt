<p>Tuesday 31 August, 1915</p>
<p>A most strenuous day. Carried water in the morning, sent to base for packs at 2.15 p.m. arrived back 7.15 on guard from 8 to 10 &amp; 2 to 4. I had to stand to arms at 4 a.m.</p>
<p>Heavy firing broke out against our trenches at 8.30 &amp; lasted till 9 p.m. This was evidently a blind to hide operations in the centre where a furious fire was heard. We have not heard what happened but presume it was an attack by the Turks. The demonstration against our trenches took the form of a heavy shower of bombs. Both sides used flares as it was a very dark night. We spent a very tense half hour, expecting to have to bring the gun into action at any minute but things died down without the enemy taking the offensive.</p>
<p>Met Nev Hodgens, have to see him tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>A lot of our chaps are crook none serious but those who are well have a lot of extra work to do.</p>
