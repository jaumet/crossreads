<p>My dear Mrs. Ferguson.</p>
<p>I received the parcel in which this was enclosed.  The ginger was particularly popular and was in splendid condition.  I suppose I have got about the best sock supply in France from you.  They are always much appreciated because if I happen to have a good stock there are always plenty of fellows who are only too glad to get hold of some.</p>
<p>We have been having a splendid time lately but have been busy the last few days.  I am as fit as ever &amp; have not felt the winter scarcely at all.  I think we have broken the back of the cold weather now anyway.</p>
<p>There is a pleasing feeling about the war in the air over here lately and everyone seems to think that some good results should be making an appearance any time now.  I wonder what the feeling</p>
