 At Artillery Rd. dress stat 
 Aeroplanes have been circling over our flank very low down  for some days now.  I have hoped that something may be expected on this flank before very long.  Possibly Ghurkhas may try to straighten the line out at Lone Pine. 
 Heard that a certain General said we should be finished here by Christmas. Very cold to-day &ndash; cold continues all through day instead of only night as heretofore. 
 General Walker hit in arm by ricochet bullet.
