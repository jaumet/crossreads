<p>natural and partly artificial being protected by an island with a</p>
<p>breakwater on either side of it.&nbsp; The usual collection of P. &amp; O.</p>
<p>steamers was in the harbour.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think there is a port in the</p>
<p>Mediterranean or the East in which you will not find at least one of</p>
<p>these aristocrats.&nbsp; And there is no doubt they are aristocrats.&nbsp; No</p>
<p>matter what harbour you may go into, if there is a P &amp; O boat there -</p>
<p>even one of their cargo ships - she seems to shine out from all the</p>
<p>other vessels.&nbsp; We first saw the French coast along a little to the</p>
<p>East of Toulon and had a good view of that city and also of the big</p>
<p>shipbuilding centre at La Ciotat.&nbsp; The harbour of Marseilles is</p>
<p>rather an historic place with its Island of Monte Christo and the</p>
<p>Chateau D&#39;If, and the numerous churches situated on the pinnacles of</p>
<p>sugarloaf hills which surround the harbour.&nbsp; Some of these churches</p>
<p>have cable trolleys up to them and I should imagine that those <sup>that</sup> dont</p>
<p>secure very few threepences now that so many of their agile parish-</p>
<p>ioners are away fighting.&nbsp; The harbour inside the breakwater was</p>
<p>well filled with shipping including the Hospital Ship &quot;La France&quot;</p>
<p>the largest vessel in the French mercantile marine and formerly a</p>
<p>Transatlantic liner.&nbsp; Here also was the Hospital Ship &quot;Braemer Castle</p>
<p>with the whole Australian No 2 General Hospital Staff aboard.&nbsp; This</p>
<p>was the Ghezireh Hospital which did such good work during our</p>
<p>Gallipoli operations.&nbsp; They are now to start work in France .&nbsp; What</p>
<p>strikes one first on landing in France is the amount of mourning</p>
<p>displayed.&nbsp; There is hardly a woman to be seen who is not in black</p>
<p>and such sights as a newly made widow walking on the arm of a wound-</p>
<p>ed son are frequent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our camp at Marseilles was in a plum orchard about 2 miles out</p>
<p>and a beautiful spot it was.&nbsp; It was not a large camp, probably it</p>
