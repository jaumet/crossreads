The church is a fine big building (Roman Catholic) and very pretty inside - surmounted by a colossal bronze statue 30ft in height glittering in the sunshine. Came down the hill in the electric lift  (84 metres) which has been constructed for the purpose. Took a tram round to the Corniche and went into the "Bains de Catalans" for a swim. The baths are built on the continental style with a big open front set with tables & chairs for afternoon tea in your dressing gown - after coming out of the water. Mixed bathing of course. The French don't go in much for swimming - they are poor swimmers & most just splash about in the water. Monday 12" June:- Yesterday afternoon (Sunday) I went for a ride in the tram out to La Barasse..
