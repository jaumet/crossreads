<p>legs, well, they appreciate it very much.&nbsp; Personally, my comfort is rather well cared for, as three 2nd Lieuts. have a four-berth cabin and our mess is good.&nbsp; Gramaphone concerts are held in the mess every night, and now that all are well again training has commenced.&nbsp; Plenty of time and nothing to worry gives plenty of time for ragging,and fun amongst the Subs. runs high .&nbsp; Quite barefaced doings are going on in the Battalion, now that there is time for it, barefaced I said, yes, the officers are shaving clean, seven moustaches, including mine, have been sacrificed to add to the gaiety of nations, or rather of the Mess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our country boys find some difficulty in accustoming themselves to a ship, why the other night a sentry in repeating his orders &quot;To march about my post in a brisk and soldierlike manner,&quot; added &quot;If I can manage it, Sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we have viewed land for the first time since passing Cape Otway, it was the shore line of Cape Lewin.&nbsp; Quite a new experience today was the Church Parade, the men crowded into one portion of the ship, the ship&#39;s bells chiming, the band playing, and a good volume of sound in the singing of the hymns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I attempt to describe an average day on a troopship; Reveille at 6 a.m. and I hear the chiming of a coffee cup alongside my bed announcing the arrival of the steward, then up and out on to the hatch and a very brisk game with medicine ball (a very heavy padded ball about 18 inches in diameter) skipping, and a hot salt bath,</p>
