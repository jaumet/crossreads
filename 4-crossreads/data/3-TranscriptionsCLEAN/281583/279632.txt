the ordinary doing tonight as the Big Guns have been firing all day & tonight have opened up with redoubled fury. We expected to move tomorrow but it has been put back for 24 hours owing to the 13th Brigade having gone back in close support to a contemplated advance by the Canadians - Tonight is Ricks Joy - Wet blankets & a bitterly cold night - I expect the same trouble again tonight as last viz. owing to the terrific gunfire our horses are terrified & all broke the lines & of course stampeded. This meant us all going after them at 1 am in a cold rain after them. Such is life.
6.9.16 Wednesday- 7.9.16  Thursday
Both nights & days have been something vile & which will be remembered by me for some time to come. It proves to be further developments of the new Somme offensive & I can tell you all previous fighting which was severe enough has been surpassed. We have done exceptionally well having taken several villages & lots of prisoners & guns.
We moved back today, passing
