<p>there a few nights ago &amp; had a royal time. For supper we had Roast fowl &amp; macaroni washed down with stout &amp; champagne what a feed we had. Joe sings very well &amp; plays the mandolin a little. I think we must have sung right through the Old Globe song book &amp; finished up with "The end of a Perfect Day". Coogan just back from leave is coming with me tonight.<br/>Received 19 letters a couple of days ago &amp; 13 to-day they were held up somewhere.<br/>We have had some glorious days lately something like good Aussie weather.<br/>8-5-17 Sam Smith called to-night we had a great old yarn over old times our "Albums" much appreciated.</p>
