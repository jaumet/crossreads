<p>15 Barana parade, Roseville Chase N.S.W. 7th June 1865<br/>The Honourable<br/>Mr Justice K.A. Ferguson.,<br/>4 Drumalbyn Rd., <br/>Bellevue Hill<br/>Dear Sir, Saturday's Herald told of your retirement from the bench and I want to thank you for serving the community so well and I wish you an enjoyable retirement for many years to come.<br/>In early 1916 you were responsible for determining the course I took in the A.I.F. You picked me out with others to go to the showground for training. I joined the (A.I.F.) 17th Bn &amp; came under the Command of H.T. Blue Allan for practically the remainder of the War. Then again you were in charge of the draft I was in from England to France. Blue Allan is now running a "Shell" Service Station at Meullaway near Coffs Harbour on the Pacific Highway, I visited him about 12 months ago &amp; have heard from him since. He is keeping well. The <strike>gas</strike> Service Station is really just something to occupy his time.</p>
