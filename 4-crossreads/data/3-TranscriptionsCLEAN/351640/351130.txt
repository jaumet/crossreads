  
 calling me to rise prepare for the labours of another day, commencing by thanking God for all his mercies and asking Him for a continuance of them for many years to come, that I may once again see you speak with you by word of mouth telling you of strange countries seen, their peoples, the happenings peaceful and savage and much else that has left impress upon my brain. Now to dress that I may not be late for breakfast. 
 Yesterday was notice at the post office - "Letters for before Christmas delivery in Australia may be posted here till 24-11-15", a few minutes ago I read a new notice wherein 24 has been changed to 23 and the hour "3 p.m." inserted. Just like the postal people here, all amateurs in this department, bunglers of no uncommon order. Should your letters reach me befor 1 p.m. I shall make brief reply. Meanwhile hereon believe that my greetings to you and my friends are reiterated for the Holy and the festive season. A few lines must be sent to Mollie and some others. 
 Good bye. Good bye. Good bye. Heaps of love and loads of kisses for each of you from Your loving & affectionate Father John B. Nash
