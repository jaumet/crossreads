Park where we were very cordially received by Mr. & Mrs. Pember.15th Our names I notice have not appeared in the social news of the Times as having left London.TGeldard & I took a stroll into the little town of Fair Oak and saw the old oak tree from which the town derives its name. In by gone days the fairs were held under this tree hence the name Fair Oak. Fairs are still held there but they are no longer the grand affair of olden times
