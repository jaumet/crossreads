<p>beggar I am &amp; with the good Wishes of you all &amp; God willing I ought to get back, when a good old Peace is once again reigning the world over. Oh what a time we will have, you &amp; I Auntie will have the first waltz, &amp; finish if with the highland fling.<br/>I am glad you received the photo safely taken in England, I believe I look very savage in it, but that doesnt matter much, so long as you all like it.<br/>Dear Aunt I am very pleased know that you all are getting on nicely &amp; especially to hear that dear old Mother &amp;amp Dad are living in Port again near you all, it will be much better for them, &amp; just the very thing I have been wishing for the last five year's, May they live there in comfort for the rest of their days.<br/>Love to you all dear Aunt &amp; best wishes<br/>Your loving Nephew<br/>Oswald</p>
