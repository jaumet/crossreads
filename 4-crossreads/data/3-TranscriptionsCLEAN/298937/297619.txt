  
 Saturday 8th July 
 No more "dinkum  oh  oil" yet.  It is absolutely ridiculous, the way we are being fooled about here. Even now all the men have not got their equipment yet, & they are supposed to have that before embarking. Inoculated 100 against  Cl  Cholera this afternoon. Since coming here there have been about 800 inoculations.  I had a second dose of Paratyphoid myself &  Chlor  & Cholera.
