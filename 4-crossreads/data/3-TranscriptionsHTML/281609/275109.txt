<p>ambulance wagons were streaming towards the dressing stations filled with wounded. More German prisoners brought in to-day.<br/>26th 1st Aus Division were relieved to-day, and Gee how tired &amp; bedraggled they were!! They had had four days heavy fighting and were glad to get a spell. They had succeeded in the task they overtook &amp; captured the village of Poizieres. But at what a cost? All day "Fritz" sent over shrapnel &amp; high explosive, to which our guns replied. About 7.30 pm the 2nd Aus Div marched into the trenches. Heavy bombardment all night by our guns.<br/>27th Great weather. Ambulances bring in more wounded most of which belong to the 5th Bde &ndash; went up to the trenches about 1 pm. Dead were lying all over the place and the stench was awful. Germans were intermixed with our own lads and some were literally blown to pieces. Shrapnel &amp; lyddyte was bursting over our support trenches and bullets were flying all over the places &ndash; Gee whiz! the dugouts of the Germans were nothing short</p>
