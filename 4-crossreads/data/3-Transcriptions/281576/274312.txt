<p>Fri. 28 (cont.)  After leaving the Pay Office Syd Hodges &amp; I went over to the War Chest Club, where we got a good 3 course meal for 1/-.  Then I went down to Liverpool St Station to meet Sam Ibbs.  Had to wait some time for his Train to arrive, so went for a stroll.  Purchased pair of Gloves 10/6 &amp; attache case 7/6 one &pound; gone.   Met Ibby.  He looks very well &amp; the uniform of the R.N.A.S suits him.  Went &amp; had a Feed, then caught the Train to Stone.  We had a great old yarn coming down in the Train.  11&frac12; years since we saw each other so we found plenty to talk about.</p>
<p>Arrived  Stone about 8.30.  Sam's wife &amp; Kiddy &amp; sister were there to meet us.  Sam's Mother greeted us warmly &amp; after a warm by a roaring Fire, Sam's wife dished us out a good Feed of Tripe &amp; Onions, which went down well.  Then we sat around the Fire, &amp; had a good old yarn.  Ibby's wife is a very nice person, &amp; a thorough Business woman.  She was very much interested in Lill's picture &amp; said I was lucky &ndash; why, of course I am.  We went to Bed about 11.  Here I discovered a hot water bottle which made good company, &amp; I slept peacefully by its side till about 8 on</p>
<p>Sat. 29. when I was awakened by Fanny Buckley bringing me a cup of Tea.  After that I got up &amp; had Breakfast.  Then we all went</p>
