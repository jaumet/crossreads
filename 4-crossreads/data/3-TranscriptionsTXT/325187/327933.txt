 [Sunday 9 July 1916[ 
 We left Camp at midnight &amp; camped in a Hod 20 miles E, we are always getting a little nearer Jerusalem, but this country does not flow with MILK &amp; HONEY but dried LOCUSTS &amp; as for fig leaves, nothing but Palms in scattered clumps  I send you a Paper  With love to you dear Mother, &amp; all at home from your loving son FV.  Some day I may be able to re-write my experience leaving ANZAC but for the present to us there seems to be too much high falutin going on- More fight &amp; less heroic tales Wanted.
