<p>Lemnos<br/>22/12/15<br/>for inspection by G.O.C.  In the evening went over to see Col Crouch at his camp near a big tower found him well and happy housed in a stone place.</p>
<p>The men all happy in their tents and singing. The first time for months they have dared to exercise their lungs in song!</p>
<p>"At the halt on the left form platoon<br/>At the halt on the left form platoon<br/>If the odd numbers don't mark time two paces<br/>How the hell can the boys form platoon?"</p>
<p>Tune:- "Red White &amp; Blue"</p>
<p>Old Brown's cow went &amp;c. Tune:- John Brown</p>
<p>"I want to go home! I want to go home<br/>Tune:- Hymn On! Steadily on!</p>
<p>All beards shaved off today and hair cut generally smartening up. Great night of song in the lines.</p>
