<p>until 6 am Monday so as to change over the shifts weekly, we fare very well for rations, the boys receive a lot of vegetables from the farm houses around. The Ration Train from the depot runs through to Douileger, Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, and supplies all Stations with rations. The work in the Cabin is fairly easy during the day, not many trains about. There is an engine comes up every morning at 7.30 am &amp; shunts the sidings at the aerodrome &amp; petrol dump, where as a rule a lot of material is handled. There are about 1000 German prisoners working in the aerodrome loading &amp; unloading material from the trucks &amp; as a rule they all are kept fairly busy.</p>
<p>Life here is not to bad, as the R.A.F. boys have a picture show on Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights starting at 7.30 &amp; finishes about 9.30 pm. The charge is only 2d for a seat</p>
