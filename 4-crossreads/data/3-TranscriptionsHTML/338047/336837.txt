<p>1918<br/>Sept 29<br/>off when a German shell landed near them getting the lot. The rest of them were also unlucky for Fritz evidently taking them, in the distance, for our men turned a machine gun onto them killing a good number.<br/>[Photograph inserted titled "No 29. German prisoners Acting as Stretcher Bearers at Messines. 7.6.17."]<br/>The tanks eventually got ahead and made the way easier. We got across the railway line and made for a small wood where his gun had been. A tank had been disabled here, but we could hear the men inside tinkering with it. At last they got it to go. It had not gone more than a few yards when Fritz spotted it and spoilt it for good with a shell. We also got some of the issue and had to lie low. As we were Reserve Battalion we did not go any further but stayed just in front of Bellicourt, the front line being about 500 yards ahead. It was not safe to go into Bellicourt as Fritz was shelling it</p>
