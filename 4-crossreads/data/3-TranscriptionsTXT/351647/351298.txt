tastes but I'd have Lloyd every time.
New Adjutant & the new orderly officer is Colin Richard.  You may know him, an old Kings School lad.  He has been quite nice to me.  I fell up on a young pal of Peter's the other day, young Reg Watt of Minda.  A quaint kid.  I haven't seen Brad lately but I did run on Duncan, looking very cold & freakish but otherwise well.  He was very nice & we talked for quite a while.  I don't think things are too nice for him but he is not so philosophic or acquiescent as I am.
I'm seriously thinking of getting to Paris again but there I don't know.  I'm restless & uneasy these days but have been better the last day or two & I expect will be better.  So many changes of our personnel upset me.
I hope for another Blighty leave next month or February & should have a good time but one never knows these days.  I try not to worry over prospects & am succeeding very well.
How is old Mac, & Tom Fogarty.  Glad you like Jack Findlay, he is a good chap.  I must write to Mrs. Bine & Miss Hilda, they are bricks to me too.  You're a bonza famille.  Glad to hear about Alison, good luck to him.
Tell the Boss I'll write in a day or so.  I must clear now.  Love to all including Graham & especially your very valued self & always believe me,
Yours to the proverbial cinder,Wilkie
