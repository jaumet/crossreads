<p>Saturday 11th Dec<br/>The Ammunition Column was still to be served &amp; I fixed them up this morning after the Anti Aircraft Gun. There was a good deal of excitement in air last night &amp; to-day owing to a number of guns being ordered away from here &amp; also men. They were to have gone last night but it was cancelled at the last moment. QMS McLaren came up in the afternoon &amp; I went along Beach with him to pay a/c of Canteen Stores &amp; also to cash cheques for him. He enticed me along to his quarters for tea. I returned about dark.</p>
<p>Sunday 12th Dec<br/>This morning I had everything cleared up.</p>
