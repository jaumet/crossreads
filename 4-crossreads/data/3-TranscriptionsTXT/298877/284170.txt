 Wednesday 30th Dec. 1914 Still anchored in Albany, a few of the lads put off today as medically unfit. Some of the boys caught a few fine fish this afternoon. 
 Thursday Dec. 31st  1914 New Year's Eve sailed out of Albany at 9 A.M. a grand sight it was to see the 16 Troopships sailing in one long line, as far as the eye could see. At present we are steering in N.W. direction, where we are going none of us know, the only escort we have seen so far, is a Submarine, but no doubt there are some Cruisers close handy. 
 Friday 1st Jan. 1915 We had a concert on board to-night, it was a great success. One of the lads on the Persic was consigned to a sailor' grave to-day, we all slacked speed just while he was cast overboard. 
 Saturday 2nd Jan. 1915 Changed our course again today travelling more north still having a splendid trip. 
 Sunday 3rd Jan. 1915 Nothing of interest. 
 Monday 4th Jan. 1915 Boxing tournament commenced tonight 
 Tuesday 5th Jan. 1915 Nothing of interest. 
 Wednesday 6th Jan. 1915 Nothing of interest 
 Thursday 7th Jan. 1915 Dead calm, very hot, getting into the tropics
