Everyone except Purser & 2 W/O's add to this a good deal of overtime each month.  Now for personalities.  The Skipper is a genial man about 50 yrs of age, and were it not that he is rather over developed amidships would be a well built man as he is well set up & has small hands & feet.  He is possessed of a shining bald head about which he passes many disparaging remarks.  He is an excellent host and always has a great store of anicdotes and yarns.
