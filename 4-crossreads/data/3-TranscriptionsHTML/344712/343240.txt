<p>evening,  I made the best shooting score in our section 19 out of twenty at two different ranges and won 15 piastres.  Aug 15/15 <u>evening</u>.  Word has just been given quietly round to prepare to march out at a minute's notice for the front.  Aug. 16th.  We marched from camp at 3 a.m. this morning entraining at Zeitoun for Alexandria where we arrived at 11 a.m., going direct from the train to the transport "Saturnia" a high decked but very narrow looking ship, with decks as greasy as a butcher's block.  The harbour was full of transports, colliers, Hospital ships etc. which interested me, but as a beauty spot the place needs a lot of retouching.  We left Alexandria at 6 p.m.  As the "Royal Edward" a British transport was sunk two days</p>
