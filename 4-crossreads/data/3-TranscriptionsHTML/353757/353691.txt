<p>Cairo is a nice place, everything on tap, as I told you previously.  If you have any self respect don't come here, you'll lose your lily-white virtue.  Mine has retained its colour well &amp; I am able to go right, with the exception of an occasional shicker, for my wife's sake, you see, speaking candidly, I love my wife.</p>
<p>You know Roy Smith of course.  We had an adventure on the old Sphinx, &amp; I will write it up &amp; send you particulars.</p>
<p>Your old cobber<br/>Arthur</p>
