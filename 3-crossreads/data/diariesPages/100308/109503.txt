4/5/17  L?Homme Mort
11 am The British seem to think that some of their men are still pushing into Bullecourt and occupying some of the houses there. Things seem extraordinarily mixed with both Boche and ourselves in the same trench. At 1 pm dined with Generals de Dalbe and Steele and Staff. The Divnl. Major General came along while we were at it. For some people this is a good war, an Armstrong hut let into sandbag barricades serves as a mess room and daintily arranged flowers are on the table. Abundance of wine beer whiskey soda etc and dinner of numerous courses served by men who are evidently trained waiters. An enormous wicker hamper is part of the mess gear evidently. They do themselves extraordinarily well. Two great expressions "as a matter of fact" and "bucked" or "awfully bucked"
2pm My two runners returned from Bde HQ. Our boys now hold still the Hindenburg line both front and support trenches in spite of their flank being in the air. Thwaites and Bennett killed and other officer casualties. Men pretty heavy. The 1st Brigade took over last night and ours moved back into the Noreuil sunken road.
