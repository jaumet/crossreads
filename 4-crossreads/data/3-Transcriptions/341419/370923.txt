<p>Down there in the valley it strikes me that we are putting up a big bluff.  They have several dummy camps, they keep moving the bgdes. from place to place in each case leaving wooden horses standing on the old horse lines while the actual line is being held by a mess of odds &amp; ends, such as a few battalions of the Zion Corps (Jews) &amp; the B.W. 1 &amp; 2.  I think that the Anz. Mount. Division is the only cavalry division left here now.</p>
<p>18.9.18<br/>Nothing more about my leave.  I think that they are under some misapprehension.  Woken up early this morning by that damned gun the Turks have on the opposite side of the valley.  Put some H.E.S. &amp; Shrapnel into Jericho &amp; killed a Bedouin.</p>
