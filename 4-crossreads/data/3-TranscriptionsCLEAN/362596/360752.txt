  
 to get you to give me some lessons on the late Tangoes and two step. Have you tried your hand at skating that is good fun. I was in Luna Park in Paris and had a great time on the rollers the floor was very lively and of course I came the customary falls but soon got my balance and with a couple of soldiers we made the pace a [indecipherable]. We are out of line now having a rest and we get plenty of games such as football.  It is good now as the weather is starting to get cold and at night we go to the Y.M.C.As and play cards, chess, draughts etc. it all helps to put in the time these long evenings, and our Battalion has started a gymnasium and so we hop along and have a fly at the punching ball or with the boxing gloves. I was surprised to hear Dad had resigned his position in the Shire, but I think the Blacksmiths Shop will be a great paying concern, I hope so. My word I'll line up when I get back for a job as I am a striker you know, and a fellow may want a job apres le guerre and would be right on the spot. How do you think I would get on?  It would be a bit different using a heavy hammer all day.
