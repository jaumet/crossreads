after a good wait at Warrington I caught the train for Crewe & here I had to wait till 2.15 finally landing in Liverpool at 4 oclock 6 hours later than I should have I slipped down to the hotel only to find the room I had booked was occupied so they had to find me another one  I turned into the bed done to the world & left instructions that I should be called at 9 oclock in the morning for I wanted a few hours sleep badly.9th.  Left Liverpool for Douglas at 11.30 this morning & the boat (Fenella) was crowded it was interesting steaming down the Mersey which was crowded with shipping of all sorts & sizes.  I was still very sleepy so I laid down on the deck & went to sleep
