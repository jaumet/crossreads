<p>June 1916 &amp;  July<br/>off we were told about the death of Lord Kitchener which was a blow to all the troops. When settled down in our new billet I was detailed off for Company orderly work. On the night of the 23rd we relieved the 1st Battalion in the firing line. Just a dusk on the 26th we saw one of our aeroplanes set fire to three enemy ballons on our extreme left &amp; was a great sight to see the big flames in midair. During our stay in the trenches it consisted of series of bombardment with artillery &amp; trench mortars which was always opened by our men &amp;  Fritz always retaliate &amp; our company suffered very heavily. We were relieved by the 45th Battalion on the night of 4th of July &amp;  marched back to our billet which was in the centre of Sailly &amp; while there I had a look round some of the old ruins &amp; we had a rest &amp; a few route marches &amp;  it was while on one of them we passed through the town of Estaires on  the 8th &amp; it is a fine big place with some fine big buildings. Our next move was on the 9th &amp; we marched to  Merris &amp;  passed through Outerstiene en route &amp;  billeted there <strike>th</strike>  till the following night when we left for Bialleul which is another fine place &amp;  entrained at 3 am on the 11th. Our train ride lasted seven hours &amp; disentrained at Fienvillers &amp; had an hours spell for it was impossible to sleep while in the train for we were packed in fairly tight &amp; my section was put on train piquet-during the trip</p>
