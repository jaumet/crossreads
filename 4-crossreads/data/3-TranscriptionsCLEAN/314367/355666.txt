One of our dolls was going over to the Una yesty. He was transferred - It was the aftn. He wasn't a very popular doll - He'd argue too much for his mates - As he & his hammick went over the side - one wag of a doll got the bugle & gave in full blast - 'The Admiral's Salute'. This is a well known call - Officers stood to attention & the Commander rushed out wondering what was up - The bugler doll got 14 days  no 10 this morning for his infernal cheek - All his spare time for 2 weeks he drills - but really I think he ought to have got clean off - his sense of humor must be good =2 pm - Raining like only the tropic can rain - The Matunga has gone out - At last - Went out this morning after endless delay & carries belated letters to Sydney - She's got a move on anyway - We're supposed to go to Bougainville to-morrow but I fancy we wont move just yet =
