 Sunday 27 July 1919 Didn't go to church parade. Played cards &amp; won 7/6. Had a bath, developed a spool &amp; went for a walk to one of the old Roman Camps. Gee they are marvellous old things. They are really strongholds &amp; redoubts &amp; must have taken a terrible amount of taking. Even now they would be hard. Took a snap of it but don't think it will show up too well. 
 Monday 28 July 1919 Two parades today. Asked for leave for tomorrow &amp; got it alright. Bill came down tonight. Played bridge again &amp; won. Do me when I win.
