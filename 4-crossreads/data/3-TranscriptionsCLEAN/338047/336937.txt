The first draft for Aussie left a few days after I arrived, George Ogle going with it.  The O.C. told mew to take his place on the phone so I shifted quarters.  I now had a room to myself in a big house that belonged to a doctor, a double bed, plenty of blankets & a stove. [Sketch of the house showing his room etc] His alleged wife (I think myself that she was an imposter) lived in the house opposite in one bottom room filled with furniture.  I don't know how she moved about the amount of stuff that was in the room.  She used to line up with the boys for tucker at our cook house
