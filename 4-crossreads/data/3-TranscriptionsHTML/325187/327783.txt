<p>Exchanging Transport Horses for mules to go to <strike>"Mersa Matru"</strike> as all sandy tracks &amp; little feed.<br/>This Regiment or rather those whoever at ANZAC missed getting any Billies-but one turned up addressed to an Officer of A Squadron- Contents looked like sausages so last night these were cooked with mashed sweet potatoes &amp; Worcester Sauce, but on getting to work the sausages panned out to be Plum Pudding put into Sausage Skins- We are tuckering well here, but it will be Bully Beef &amp; Biscuit again soon.<br/>A travelling kitchen is the best present for any rich man to give to a Regiment</p>
