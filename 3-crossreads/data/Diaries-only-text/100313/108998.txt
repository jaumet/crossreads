Awoke to find it snowing drifting flakes softly falling from a dead black sky and covering the ground everywhere. Ordered all parades inside and then inspected the whole camp finding that there is much room for improvement all round owing to the state of repair in which the huts are. Pottered round all the morning and ordered some improvements. In the afternoon it cleared up and I went over to Brigade and saw the General about the Cadet Battalion. A flock of Gothas came over late and were engaged by our people. Put all men under cover while they were about. N.C.O's school still in progress. Our Canteen is not doing such good business here owing to the proximity of the Y.M.C.A. Sent forward platoon commanders and Major Matthews to reconnoitre up to the Corps Line. Great improvement shown by the Band under Monaghan.
