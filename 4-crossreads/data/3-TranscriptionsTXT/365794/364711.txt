Sunday 4 November 1917Quiet day.  Cannot hear any singing though know it must be going on all day.Ask Capt. for something to give me some energy, at which he appears amused & reads me a little lecture on the wise arrangement of nature in giving us that want of energy so that we may properly recover.  I reply that never having been ill like this I do not know the feeling but nothing daunts the English out to educate the "A.A." so he asks if says "but of course you have nursed lots of pts. who felt like this".  Betsy utterly crushed makes no more remarks.  Reads & tries to make the best of a bad business.
