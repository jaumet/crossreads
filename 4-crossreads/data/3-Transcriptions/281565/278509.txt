<p>soldiers aboard.</p>
<p>After some queer demonstrations of submarine dodging we arrived at Lemnos on Tuesday 26th Oct.</p>
<p>Numerous transports were lying in the port together with about 20 warships.  Numerous Destroyers <strike>dash</strike> &amp; submarines dashed about, while a constant stream of supply ships passed to &amp; fro.</p>
<p>The hills fringing the port were almost covered with the white tents of various camps.</p>
<p>Things on board had become very bad by Oct. 31st.  Food ran scarce;  latrines in an awful state;  lice made an appearance on board &amp; sickness continued to spread.</p>
<p>A newspaper for the purpose of causing a little amusement on board was brought out under the name of the Latrinograph.  The first issue appeared on Wednesday 27th Oct. &amp; created quite a sensation going to the officers &amp; to the Flagship "Agamemnon".  The second issue Friday 29th &amp; 3rd October 31st Sunday.</p>
