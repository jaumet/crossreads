<p><strike>Last night</strike> Today we were invited to afternoon tea on board of "Monitor" it is lying out a little from here &ndash; Four sisters &amp; two of out Officers accompanied us. We went over in a little rowing-boat. It has been a perfect day and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I have been several times on the same boat before. As we were nearing our quarters we met Fred &amp; one of his officers on horse-back, so they are coming after dinner to take us for a little walk. I got a few other letters from Australia to-day, one from dear old Annie, Alice Bower &amp; one from Mrs Barrie's sister from Penzance. Perhaps Sister Hart did not stay in Melb. she was bound for Queensland, so don't suppose she had time to get out to see you. I have not seen Archie McCurdie yet &amp; no letter from him since I've answered his &ndash; one never can tell how long letters take to reach their destination. Hope I shall get you photos soon. What a good thing Dr Perry is</p>
