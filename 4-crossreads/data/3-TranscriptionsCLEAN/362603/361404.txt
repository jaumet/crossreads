2.  but Ellis was done & passed A.1..  Nearly all the Unit are going to France for Field Work but Ellis & I are to stay here to help run the Hospital.  Our Unit are being replaced by C Class Men & they are terrible.  There is not an A.M.C. Man amongst them.  Our Orderley is Paralized in the right hand & fore arm & can just write & that's all.  Another cove is a Russian & speaks several languages but can't write His own name in English, so he is not much use.  They are all very weary sick men but I suppose we will have to manage somehow.  It throws a lot of unnecessary extra work on to Ellis & I but never mind we are here to work & never grumble now.Well George, nothing happens & as I have yet to write to Mum after a long day, I will wind up By wishing all the Porman & Miles Family the best of wishes & also Frootie & Jack Lord.  Jack is an old Sticker.  I will try & write to Him, just a few lines.Best wishes to all the BoysFrom Your Loving brotherHarry X
