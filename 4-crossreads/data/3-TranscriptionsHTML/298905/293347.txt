<p>whether we take or fail in the charge however the boys are all very confident over it, most of the Battalions are new &amp; untried practically &amp; they little know which is just as well for them what they have to face, I am speaking of course of our reinforcements, for nearly 90% of the men are reinforcements there is of course no harm in being that in many ways they are better than old hands for they dont realize the danger like one who has been through the mill does, &amp; I believe the old saying is pretty true: that a soldier fights best in his first battle, I'll bet the boys will go like tigers &amp; take a lot of stopping however the future is in the lap of the Gods.<br/>Payday so the boys are all as merry as crickets</p>
