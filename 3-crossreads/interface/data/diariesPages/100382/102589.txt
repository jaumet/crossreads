After the concert I was again told off for submarine guard the next morning I took my first post at 6 am. We left Toulon at 8 am set sail for Marseilles which we reached about 2 pm. To look for the entrance to the harbour is a puzzle from the ocean for there is also a big brake water here too we were guided through this towards our wharf. It was then raining but the band struck up the Marseillaise as we passed the wharf the cheering was deafening. When the boat was tied up to the wharf the gang ways swung I was detailed off to help unload our gear off the boat it was then that I first put my foot in France. Marseilles Harbour is a fine big place there were dozens of boats of all sizes there the wharfs are also fine with their big storage sheds etc. We did not disembark till about half past nine that night then we were lined up marched in fours to the Railway station which was about a quarter of an hours walk from the boat. On reaching the station we had to sit down wait till the gear etc was put on the train first
