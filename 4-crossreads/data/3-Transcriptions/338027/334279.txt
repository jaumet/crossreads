<p>Tuesday, 1st December, 1914<br/>Arrived at Suez about 2 p.m. where all the other boats were waiting.  An order was read out that every man with rifle &amp; ammunition must get the same in readiness as an attack is expected in the canal from the banks.  As far as we know we are going to Alexandria to disembark.  We dropped anchor about a mile from the mouth of the canal in view of both towns of Suez official &amp; Arab town.</p>
<p>Cigarettes most expensive in Melb. are ridiculously cheap here.  Nights are rather cold now.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 2nd December, 1914<br/>Still anchored outside Suez at seven a.m. a large fleet of ships was seen on the horizon as they approached headed by the old Euryalus &amp; a French cruiser we saw that they were the 2nd Indian contingent en route to the front.  We greeted them with cheers &amp; they us with frantic whoops &amp; yells.  They anchored alongside us fifteen in all.  With our boats &amp; the Indian transports all anchored at the mouth of the canal it made an imposing sight.  The loyalty of Britains dominions.  We received some very satisfactory war news that the Allies were gaining ground.</p>
