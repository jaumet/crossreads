close to the Canal, and about 14 miles from Ismailia. The latter place I visited on Sunday last with Percy Ross another Battery commander in this Brigade. We found it quite the nicest little town we have yet struck in Egypt being all French & Italian, and the nigger element consequently not nearly so thick.
There is a very excellent club there, which has been placed at the disposal of the Canal garrison while we are here, by the Committee, and one can get a very decent bath and lunch there.
I have not heard anything of our 1st & 2nd Divs since they left for France but Eric Richards met them on his way here from England
