"Goodbye Australia"S.S. Mongolia  July 9th  1916.IThy bold outlines growing dimmer, in the sunset's golden glimmerJutting headland, rocky slope and winding bayAnd the troops are gathered forward, with strained eyes gazing shoreward,Just to catch the last glimpse fading with the day.
2For a passionate devotion, strong and boundless as the ocean,For a Home of  Homelands, glorious and FreeWith a solemn strange insistence, as we swing out in the distanceThrills our hearts anew with sacred love to thee.
3All the tender ties that bind us. All the memories that remind usOf thy Shores, thy sun kissed lands, thy beauty rareEvery golden recollection, stirring chords of deep affectionBuilds anew the heart's High Throne, and sets thee there.
