  
 Friday March 14th Lakin woke me up this morning & said "Get up & look at "Aussie". I hopped out of Bunk & gazed on the Long-Looked for Land." It gave me quite a thrill to think that somewhere on that great island the daintiest pair of feet were walking, & the sweetest blue eyes in the world were spreading gladness around. It makes B.E. seem so much nearer now. We arrived at Freemantle at about 3 a.m. or rather outside Freemantle, we were not allowed anywhere near on account of the 'Flu Epidemic. A couple of water barges soon came alongside, & brought some Papers along, which were needed as we hadn't any news of Aussie for many weeks.  We were all mighty anxious to know how the Epidemic was progressing & Arrival at Freemantle it was a great relief to find out that it wasn't as bad as was reported. The Port M.O'r came aboard bout 8. They took everyman's temp on the Boat, & we were all relieved that no one was above normal. A number of Letters & Telegrams came aboard, which gave great pleasure to the recipients. Several parties of Girls came out in motor Launches, but they were not allowed near the ship, which was hard [indecipherable] Anyhow they gave us as good a welcome as possible under the circs. Piles of Books & magazines, & Fruit were sent aboard, all of which were mighty welcome. About 4 p.m. the W.A's managed to get away. We gave them a rousing cheer as they left & looked on them with envious eyes. About 10 p.m. we resumed our journey, & are now on the way to Adelaide our next port of call.
