 Tuesday 9 January 
 On Piquet.  Went into Vignacourt for tea and afterwards spent a very fine evening at a concert given by Tommies in the local Hall.  It was a great success &ndash; a scream from commencement to finish.  I doubt whether I have ever seen a better one.  The new 5th Divisional Australian Band performed splendidly under Wellings.
