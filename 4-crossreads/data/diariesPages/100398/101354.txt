25/11/16 at 6.37 Experienced our first incident of note since leaving Cape Town. Came in the manner of a heavy jolt, followed by peculiar stunts on the part of ship & an avalanche of officers into the engine room. Excitement; speculation Struck a mountain trout, a whale, a rock, a derelict, or a jettisoned carcase of cape mutton (I favor the latter theory.) Actually she has flung a blade & split her tail shaft: Cause floating wreckage of some kind unknown, but as we’re in the Gulf it may have been a log of African hardwood tangled in floating weed. She scraped it & got it finally with her blades.
