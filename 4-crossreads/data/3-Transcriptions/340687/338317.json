<p>January, 1917. Saturday 13<br/>Arose at 10 to 8 but got on to the job at 9 all right. Only work was to unload and stack from 3 pontoon loads. Intensely bitter west wind all day with some sleet and very cold standing round. In the afternoon a heavy "strafe" with howitzers took place and particularly on our left. Presumably one of our daylight raids. Got home at 3.45</p>
