When Theatre was out about 11 pm I met an Australian officer who insisted we should dine & so at 11 pm we commenced our meal. This is not late as city is only just coming to life & all the night is still before it. We did not eat much 3 courses & yet it cost 43 fr. Food is very dear here & the Princes Restaurant
