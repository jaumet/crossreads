  
 (& site of likely minefields) Every man sleeps with his lifebelt under his pillow & boatdrill parades of all on board are held daily. No bugle calls are sounded & no parades  are held  or gatherings allowed on deck. Thursday 30" March Great excitement caused yesterday about 10 a.m. by sight of small black object on starboard bow - perhaps an enemy submarine. No such luck, as it turned out to be a fishing boat. Plenty of shipping now discernable & island of Malta in sight. We passed close in to Malta & Goza & only wished we could get ashore. A fine sight was witnessed while passing Goza: - 2 large troopships passed us under full steam with an escort of 2 destroyers
