 [Friday 8 December 1916] 
 Usual Reconnaissance same as last July  but - Days cooler &amp; nights really cold- The desert has more life now, small birds Plovers etc but no water beyond the gallon a day &amp; Salt WELL NO TENTS, &amp; issued rations only, I'm soft &amp; fat &amp; will feel it for the first few nights I expect.  Glad to hear that J.D.Meredith is on his way back. ( PRIVATE  I should get my Majority i.e. Major inside 6 months with luck.)   My Bivouac is built of Blankets &amp; Jim Ayres is a Trooper not far away- Had to cut all my HAIR off close again- Salt Water &amp; Sand not a good Hair Wash.
