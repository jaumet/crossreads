<p>March 31<br/>24.<br/>"Limehouse Nights" holds the favour beyond Mlle. de Maupin.  Sol's criticism, after a pause following "Tuppy's reading it" &ndash; "awful book", as good as Sully's summing up of de Maupin &ndash; "its melopticious!"  "Dauter" holds favour well.  I'd intended sending it to Geoff, but will leave it for unit reading.</p>
<p>No confirming of losing of Vimy Ridge, report of midnight 29 admitted attack by six divisions supported by force, but reported are still holding.  Saxons have been in the front, a raid last night brought prisoners &ndash; Boche labour men and pioneers.  Its evident our Pioneers and theirs are of different standings.</p>
<p>Up at 6.30 and its raining hard:  now, about 9, clouds are coming up over an April sun.  The sky of evening full of strange lovely colourings &ndash; grey clouds over the bowl, and delicate reflections and [indecipherable] of lights about the horizon, now a deep sky of soft stars.</p>
<p>25.<br/>Tonight out of D.R. met on duckboard Capt. Murphy and a yarning of the loveliness of the evening, of etchings &ndash; suggested by the fine silhouettes of the trees:  of poetry, and the novel.  So straight to Hut, and by the fire, am here listening to Sol's tales of the College, then half a dozen about us, general yarning of syphilis.</p>
<p>April 1<br/>26.  April<br/>Back from De Zon Camp, hearing there of A. Section moving today to Renescure.</p>
<p>Losing two years, today we arrived in the mist of the morning at Marseille, and spent a day in the stream wondering at all the colours of the sun over Marseille.  Losing one year, today we left Buire for Aveluy, land where the Boche rules.</p>
<p>27.<br/>So dumping of books commences.  This from Act 3 of Chastelard,</p>
<p>"Have you read never in Fr. [French] books the song<br/>Called the Duke's song, some boy made ages back,<br/>A song of drag nets hauled across thwart seas<br/>And plucked up with rent sides, and caught therein<br/>A strange-haired woman with sad singing lips<br/>Cold in the cheek like any stray of sea,<br/>And sweet to touch?  So that men seeing her face<br/>And how she sighed out little Ahs of pain<br/>And soft cries sobbing sideways from her mouth,<br/>Fell in hot love, and having lain with her<br/>Died soon?  One time I could have told it through,<br/>Now I have kissed the sea-witch on her eyes,<br/>And my lips ache with it:  but I shall sleep<br/>Full soon, and a good space of sleep."</p>
<p>Compare with Wilde's "Fisherman and his Soul".</p>
