<p>noticed the men on the duckboard in front of me stop and give a glance to the side at a certain point, and it made me curious, but when I got there I was sorry to see a man from our Battalion lying dead on a stretcher. He was shot the night before and I believe the stretcher bearers had so much difficulty in travelling through the mud with him when he was wounded that he lost heart and died. The reason I mention this sad incident is, that this man was the first man in our Battalion I saw lying dead in the mud, and it will never leave my memory, especially the circumstance attending it. At last we came to a soup kitchen and had some soup, which was very stimulating to us and was the means of getting us to us camp a short while after.</p>

On arriving at Rouen Railway Station we were met by motor ambulances and conveyed to Hospitals. I was conveyed to No8 Hospital where I was in bed a few days and then sent to convalescent camp. While in the hospital it was Xmas, and most of the boys who were out of bed decorated the ward with the aid of the Sister. The orderlies and the sisters provided a good concert in the evening, which was very much appreciated by the patients in the ward.</p>
