 Dear Father Well have found my way to France again. Oh well I have nothing to complain about this time have had six months spell & missed the winter across here that is the main thing. It has turned rather cold here the last week or so. Not as cold as I have felt it in France but still cold enough. I dare say we have felt it more after the warm weather we have been having. But the winter is just about over here now. May it starts to warm up a bit. We had a few days at the M.G. Base before coming up to the unit. I have transferred to the 1st M.G.
