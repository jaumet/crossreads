  
 I believe a concert was held in the afternoon. In the evening the boys were given permission to use the piano & have a sing-song  on th  by themselves. I took the opportunity of having a good read & sleep and of writing a few cards up in "our room". In the evening we played five-hundred till 'lights-out'. 
 Were we sorry at not being at home & celebrating New Year's Day in the usual style?   No!  Are we downhearted?  No!!!   The only trouble with us was that the plum pudding which we usually get on Sunday was Kept till Monday, 1st Jan, and as a result, it sat on our chests that day instead of the  preceed  preceding one. 
 Thus have we commenced the New Year "On Active Service". It is a year of soldiering for us, what its pages will disclose cannot event be imagined;  it is only to be hoped that the bright news from the Front continue in the days to come as during the last week or so.
