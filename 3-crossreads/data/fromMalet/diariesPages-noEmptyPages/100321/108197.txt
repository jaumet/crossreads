18/2/19 Coblenz
quite good company on the trip. Andernach is situated right on the Rhine and from the train can be seen a large part of the old city wall preserved and incorporated in the modern buildings. Brohl Sinizig and Remagen we also passed. The Rhine should look lovely in Spring viewed from a boat. Reached Cologne at 7.30 and dined at the Club where some of the youths were a bit merry.
19/2/19
At 10 a.m. set off with Corlette Davis in a car the Second Army lent us and took a run first up to the Opera House and then out to the Aerodrome. Arrived there we had a look first at the nacelle of a Zepp. which was on a train and got a piece as a souvenir. Then round the drome where many old Hun aeroplanes were still lying. One was made of corrugated iron ?
