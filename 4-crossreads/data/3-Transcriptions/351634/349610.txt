We next drove them out of a sap and cut three of their telephone wires We got strong opposition in the shape of machine gun when we got past this We drove them out of this and advanced further across flat country we could hear the Turks getting their guns away but they were too fast for us and knew the country well Anyway we got to our position and dug ourselves in before daylight expecting counter attack but no Turks came The British and Gurkas and Sikhs advanced up towards 971 and were meeting with strong opposition. The Turks were bringing their reinforcements up in thousands and as soon as they got to top of hill The warships started into them.
