6 May, 1916Romanie [Romani]Not much doing this few days, been on out post or picquet each night & one day went out on patrol.  The tucker is more or less good, for a couple of days we got bully & hard biscuits but last night we got some bread, it was real good stuff.  Sams said the man who baked it ought to get the D.C.M.  It was thundering hot yesterday but to day there is a lovely cool breeze blowing,  Last night I received a parcel from Madge, it was first rate,  I had just run out of cigarettes & the chocolates were quite a luxery.  Bill got a box of wafers fancy the old sport getting that fancy stuff. it did not last long
