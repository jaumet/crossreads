The Jealous Lover
I would take your little throat in my handsSlight to snap as a flower stemBut I could not kill the light in your eyesIt would still be found in the morning skiesA valley pool or a turquoise gem
I could hush your voice with my finger's pressLeave you a broken silent thingBut the lilt of the bird in the green scrub heartThe sough of the wind and your tones would startAnd your words in the soft rain sing
I could tear you out of my soul to dayLearn to hate & curse you tooGive my heart to the surgeon's knifeBut what were the use of a shattered lifeBleeding to death for need of you
