<p>16 June, 1916<br/>Perce got back from the school last night they had a good time in Cairo &amp; he looks well on it  Most of the boys did well at the school also.  Joe Woods is going on leave to night he is already contemplating the gorges of sweet melons &amp; oranges etc he is going to have.  I wish I was going in to Port Said with him.  Rumour says that we are for the desert very shortly &amp; I for one dont feel like going out to out post &amp; thirsty stunts again.  About 12 areoplanes flew over the camp here on Sunday - I believe they went out &amp; bombed the Turkish camp at 'Al c Reaeh' which they set on fire &amp; played up old Harry generally, but three of the machines were brought down.  I have to go in with Joe Woods to night to Kantara as a horse holder.</p>
