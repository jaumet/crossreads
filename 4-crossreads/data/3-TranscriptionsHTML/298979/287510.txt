<p>of the sentries on watch, evidently without any knowledge of what was happening, shot the man dead. Thereupon one of the Machine Gunners, from a position immediately opposite, went over the top to bring the body in, but unfortunately he also was shot dead by the sentry who evidently thought both men were Huns who had succeeded in passing through our "wire". These accidents are, thank Heaven, very few &amp; far between, but they certainly forced the men to be absolutely sure before firing on any one afterwards.</p>
<p>The effect of the first experience of shell fire bursting so close was to fill the men with awe, at the intense power exerted by the explosive contained in the shells, &amp; the amount of earth displaced seemed astounding however, most of them were to discover that these shell bursts were nothing, compared to some of the gigantic shell bursts to be seen in later days.</p>
<p>After about an hours experience during which nerves were at a tension, wondering when the next shell would burst, each effect seemed much more intense the closer the shell came, the sensations of wonder, surprise, &amp; doubt, were succeeded by a calmer attitude &amp; a longer acquaintance produced a feeling of almost callous indifference.</p>
<p>It was also further noticed that during the strained waiting &amp; listening for the least sound of the screech of a shell, really initiated the training of the senses to detect the difference only momentarily, of course, but wonderfully distinct &amp; separate, in the noise through the air (or screech) made by a shell which burst at a comparatively close distance, &amp; one that would burst out of range of doing harm to the listener.</p>
<p>In a very short time it was common to hear the cry to "Keep low" given, clearly denoted by the peculiar &amp; particular sound made by a shell about to strike in the immediate vicinity or to hear, "Oh! that's going over", to the sound caused by a shell falling well out of range.</p>
