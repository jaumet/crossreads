<p>1916 &nbsp; TUESDAY 18 &nbsp; JULY</p>
<p>A decent warm day at last. M<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Neylan had us for flag drill in morning &amp; we &nbsp;were working the helio-graph in afternoon. It is interesting work in the open like this. I received a paper (Sunday Times) from Linda and a letter from Alan from Scotland. Had a game of Cricket and some kicks at the football in evening</p>

<p>Here&#39;s to the man who plans things&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Builds things&nbsp;&mdash; makes things&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
<p>Who prates not of wonders of old;</p>
<p>Nor gloats on&nbsp;ancestral gold,</p>
<p>But takes off his coat &amp; takes a hold,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And does things.</p>
