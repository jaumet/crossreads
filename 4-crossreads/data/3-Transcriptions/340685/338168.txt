<p>Hodgson who was dragged into it against his will but made a fair effort. It was all a joke but he has been having a bad time lately by everyone. After numerous discussions interjections etc, it was left as an open question and was carried on heatedly down in our mess-room until long after lights out. But personally it won't affect me in the slightest as I shall swear whenever I feel inclined which however is not very often at all.<br/>12.4.16 We are to cross the line to-day at midday and I believe that many instruments of torture have been devised for the benefit of those who haven't crossed before. It is quite clear and very warm. Later, we don't cross the line till midday to-morrow. The performance started at  3.30 P.M. and a big canvas tank supported by a wooden structure and a sort of raised dais for the court of King Neptune. The actors came promptly on the scene and the get ups were very creditable considering the limited resourses. Mr &amp; Mrs Neptune and daughter with an accusing clerk and a crowd of policeman. All the officers were accused and after taking a dough pill and a salt-mixture gargle they were seated adjacent to the tub at a suitable height on a easily overturned    <strike>an</strike> manure basket from the stables and lathered with a white wash brush &ndash; the lathers consisting of a mixture of sea water flour and soot. A large board shaped as a razor was then passed over the affected portions and the superfluous lather wiped off on any part of their clothing after which they were <strike>overt</strike> somersaulted backwards into the tub where they were well ducked. All the officers were treated and took it well and a goodly quantity of the youth around who were more or less well-known but there wasn't nearly enough time for all. The charges were very good and also the penalties. The fun stopped at tea time (5) and the remainder    <strike>we</strike> all tumbled into the bath in such a crowd that the canvas had to be cut to let out the water such was the danger of an accident.<br/>13.4.16 It was great on deck last night. I slept under the awnings in my hammock and a bonza breeze was blowing and I slept well. We were all medically examined this afternoon and it is rumoured there is a case of measles on board which may put us into quarantine in many more cases break out.</p>
