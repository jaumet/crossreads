<p>Tuesday 3rd August<br/>Went for fresh water at Headquarters today. Had a delightful swim. In the evening there was a small demonstration by our Infantry. A few mines were fired and the idea was to attract the attention of the enemy while some other troops were landed here, included Gurkas British Tommies and about 1000 more Australians. Just now there is a persistent rumour that we are to be relived especially those who have been in the firing line during the past 3 months. You can quite understand the strain is telling and our ranks have been greatly depleted owing to sickness and casualties.</p>
<p>Wednesday 4th August<br/>I do not know whether it was the effect of the pancakes I ate last night or the want of something substantial that made me enter the land of dreams. I was amidst the smell of the East and the noises and the domes of its mosques &ndash; the hot sun</p>
