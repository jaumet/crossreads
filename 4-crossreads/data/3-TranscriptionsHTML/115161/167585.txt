<p>We are under shell-fire from Fritz. They fall all round, &quot;feeling&quot; for our batteries and &quot;dumps&quot;. (A &quot;dump&quot; means the place set apart for food supplies, or ammunition, or other materials necessary for the prosecution of the war. In the earlier stages of the war the various materials were placed together in great heaps, but latterly the wisdom of smaller heaps scattered over a larger area, was recognized. The result being evident, that where in the earlier days a shell would destroy the whole &quot;dump&quot;, it would now only ruin or blow up a portion.

He cut some sticking stuff off in strips and then stick the stuff from under each foot to a little way up the legs, thus closing the &quot;cuts&quot;. Every morning these straps were &quot;ripped&quot; off and new ones put on. The ripping process was painful, and I wondered why they were not removed gently, without daily tearing open the wounds. Eventually one morning in ripping off the straps, the intervening piece of flesh came out with the straps. I had to give up wearing boots and took instead to wrapping sand bags</p>
