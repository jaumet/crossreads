  
 round there I went but one patient was a suspect for meningitis which caused a general disturbance both in the camp I brought him from & my crowd.  They examined him but would not take him in so had to run him to "Estairs".  After much argument they took him in & I got back for tea about 8.30 P.M.  Altogether a very busy day & an interesting one. 
 Tuesday 22nd August Orderly Sergeant for the day.  Had to attend the court martial of one of our chaps & spent most of the day at the court & was not called at all.  Did nothing but wait & wait for hours.  Had a little fun going down.  Two of us got a lift in the Generals car & passed the officers down the road who were walking to the Court, they thought it a great joke for us to ride in the car & asked me when I ordered it.  Had a few bright hours at night.  We started for a long walk & cracked enough champagne to make us feel happy.  After the tattoo & reading of orders we had a "gas alert" come along & I had to warn all the chaps in the billet
