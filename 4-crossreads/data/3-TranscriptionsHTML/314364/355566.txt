<p>Friday March 14th<br/>Lakin woke me up this morning &amp; said "Get up &amp; look at "Aussie". I hopped out of Bunk &amp; gazed on the Long-Looked for Land." It gave me quite a thrill to think that somewhere on that great island the daintiest pair of feet were walking, &amp; the sweetest blue eyes in the world were spreading gladness around. It makes B.E. seem so much nearer now. We arrived at Freemantle at about 3 a.m. or rather outside Freemantle, we were not allowed anywhere near on account of the 'Flu Epidemic. A couple of water barges soon came alongside, &amp; brought some Papers along, which were needed as we hadn't any news of Aussie for many weeks.  We were all mighty anxious to know how the Epidemic was progressing &amp;<br/>Arrival at Freemantle<br/>it was a great relief to find out that it wasn't as bad as was reported. The Port M.O'r came aboard bout 8. They took everyman's temp on the Boat, &amp; we were all relieved that no one was above normal. A number of Letters &amp; Telegrams came aboard, which gave great pleasure to the recipients. Several parties of Girls came out in motor Launches, but they were not allowed near the ship, which was hard [indecipherable] Anyhow they gave us as good a welcome as possible under the circs. Piles of Books &amp; magazines, &amp; Fruit were sent aboard, all of which were mighty welcome. About 4 p.m. the W.A's managed to get away. We gave them a rousing cheer as they left &amp; looked on them with envious eyes. About 10 p.m. we resumed our journey, &amp; are now on the way to Adelaide our next port of call.</p>
