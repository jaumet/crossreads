<p>Wednesday June 28. 1916<br/>We arrived in Table Bay last night and lay too until daylight, when we came slowly into and lay opposite the Pier. The sight was a beautiful one. Before us was the Table mount, with the city nestled below, a long range of low mountains around the bay on the left. (East) a lighthouse on an Island. (Robin Is). Directly in front a huge search light and on the West a flash light at the foot of the mount known as green point. From this point the city winds round the foot of Table Mount and fringing the bay for several miles.</p>
<p>An account of measles on board the yellow flag was flown and we were delayed for some time. At last we moved round slowly to the entrance of a very large dock and had to lay too in order for room to be made for us. At last when a large steamer moved out we got in and lay alongside one of the numerous <strike>piers</strike> <strike>wharfs</strike> wharves at 11.8. a.m. This is a very busy harbour. This morning their were alongside the various warfs 12 large steamers, 4 ships, 1 dredge several tugs &amp; small steamers, &amp; a fleet of fishing boats.</p>
