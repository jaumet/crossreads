<p>My dear Mr Beeken,</p>
<p>I have been wanting you address so that I might write to you and tell you how very deeply I sympathise with you and Mrs Beeken on the loss of your brave son. I personally was much distressed to hear of his death. He was such a fine, manly, fellow and he was a good officer and much esteemed  by all who served with him. Brave to a fault, and patient and honourable are the qualities of a true gentleman and a good soldier and such was your son. Please accept my condolences for you and his mother in your troubles.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>R.M. Nolen<br/>[indecipherable] 3rd Bn. A.I.F.</p>
