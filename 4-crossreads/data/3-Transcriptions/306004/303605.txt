<p>21.11.16<br/>Tues 21st<br/>Muster parade at 9 oclock this morning &amp; rode to Bir-El-Abd &amp; had our blankets &amp; clothes fumigated to kill lice, it was one of the silliest parades we have yet had, as very few if any of the lads here are troubled with them. we arrived back in camp at 3 oclock this afternoon. Roger gave a good exhibition of rooting this morning &amp; got rid of me twice before I beat him; Heard today that we are going out in front in a few days &amp; expect to be fighting by the 29th</p>
