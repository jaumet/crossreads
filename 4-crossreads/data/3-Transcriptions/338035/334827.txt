<p>got to Liverpool St. Station and then to Petticoat Lane (Middlesex St.).  There we had the fun of our lives and it would be hard to imagine that such a thing existed in such a civilised city.  Hawkers there sell every article under the sun with not refined language and the whole scene is Bedlam itself.  We had to push &amp; shove all the way thro' the length of street (about &frac14; mile) and there was an air of jollity about the whole thing which decided for us that we had spent a good time.<br/><strike>Back to Ald</strike> On way back to Aldwych we went through St. Pauls Cathedral and was even more impressed than by Westminster.  The coloring was brilliant.  It is said that directly beneath the dome in the Vaults lies Lord Nelson.  The tame pigeons (hundreds of them) made a very pretty scene and people came in motors and in foot to feed these pigeons by hand.<br/>An excellent dinner at our Y.M.C.A. (we had waited for half an hour in vain at Appendroidi's in the Strand).<br/>Wash &amp; brush up etc. and as the others had made other arrangements I left then and proceeded to Kings Cross thence to Charing Cross and obtained a tube to Richmond (just beyond Kew Gardens).<br/>Richmond was quite gay and excellent place for a Sunday's diversion.  The park is a huge place where there are tame deer &amp; other animals also a Hospital for wounded.</p>
