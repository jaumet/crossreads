<p>Capt Bean whom we directly come under, came over today and visited the   Exhibition. I am urging that the present set of enlargements be sent to Australia for propaganda. No better medium could we possibly have. The Exhibition has boon pronounced by experts to be the best since the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>6th June<br/>7 and 8 June</p>
<p>At Galleries. Have great difficulty in securing capable lecturers for the color slides. The attendance is rapidly on the increase. I am having a great fight to secure the pictures for Australia. It makes me lose patience when I see all my efforts over which I spent</p>
