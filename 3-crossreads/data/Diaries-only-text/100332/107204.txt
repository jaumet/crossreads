This place is about the prettiest I have seen up to date, it being built on the Top of the Hill has Farms right up the slope dotted here there with numbers of Wind Mills so very close together all revolving. The green pastures with the sun shining on the grass the Red Tile Roofs of the Houses made a beautiful picture. A large Chateau on one part of the Hill stands out very prominent. This part like all other parts of Belguim France Belguim is nearly all under cultivation or preparing, very little unimproved land is to be seen here there are the French Men Women busy ploughing Seeding. We only stayed at the Station a few minutes we were off again arrived in Hazebruick on time a little later we all arrived back at the Depot all satisfied very much of our interesting day's outing. When signing off I was instructed with another Driver to report to the Orderly Room at 9m am tomorrow Thursday to proceed back to the Main Camp at Peselhoek, because the Blighty Leave is to start in a few days we are in the first draw, so my experiences of learning the Roads here there will have to wait until my return from leave, when I hope to again visit Dunkirk other places, it came as a suprise to me as I arranged to be over in Blighty during April, so I must somewhat alter my plans now.
