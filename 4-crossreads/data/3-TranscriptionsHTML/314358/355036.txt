<p>There were some devotees in one part with their faces towards Mecca, praying for dear life quite unconscious of our presence. Our old villian [villain] told us all the history of the place in several languages broken to [shards?] to such an extent that we were unable to understand him. After a while we came to a [indecipherable] oblong space in the tiled wall and with the assistance of one of his learned friends the Gagool explained that a mirror once was fixed there. There was nothing strange in that we suggested, yes yes but that particular mirror had wonderful magic power, the poor blind had only to look in it and they could see. Silly old man of course if they could look they should be able to see, but he did not mean to be whitty [witty], he meant their sight was restored. "Where is the mirror now" we asked. Oh the French had taken it and it could never be found again.</p>
