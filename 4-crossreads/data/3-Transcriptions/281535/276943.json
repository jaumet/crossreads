<p>30/4/19<br/>Cologne<br/>up to Cologne. Once more passed Bingen, Lovelly and all the glory of masses of fruit blossom. Came into Cologne at noon and put up and dined at the Officers Club. Afterwards walked round till 5.30 when I secured a ticket for the Opera and met two Aust. nurses whom I took to afternoon tea. Then went to a final performance of "Rigoletto" which we much enjoyed. Afterwards went to the Officers Club but they would not allow the girls in so I took them round to the VIth Corps Club where after a bit of trouble I managed to get fixed up. Did some tipping afterwards. Coming back to our billets noticed many people drunk both soldiers and civilians &ndash; one well dressed woman escorted by her husband staggering across the place of the Cologne Cathedral.</p>
