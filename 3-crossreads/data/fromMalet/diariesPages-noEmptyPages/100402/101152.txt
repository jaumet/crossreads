Another fine day drive to Ambleside on Windermere via Thirlmere, Grasmere Rydal waters. Grasmere is very pretty indeed one gets a view of Wordsworth's Cottage Seat. Thirlmere is now the source of water supply for Manchester, but the Lake is not all spoilt. The drive is very fine past Helvellyn, but not as much so as yesterdays?.
