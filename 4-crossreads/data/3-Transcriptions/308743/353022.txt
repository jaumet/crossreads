<p>27 August 1915<br/>Friday</p>
<p>Another comparatively quiet night &amp; in the morning the artillery was banging away at each other, but at 4.30 the arty started a bombardment of Knoll 60 Navy assisting Gen Cox made the first report at 11.50 as follows.  By 2200 we appeared to make some headway towards knoll 60, especially in centre but have not reached top as the Turks were not driven out by bombardment &amp; consequently the resistance is strong, a later message states that Austns are on [indecipherable] with NZrs not far short of knoll the Connaughts are working trench D to C.  Col Pope who can see well from his position reports he has gained two trenches &amp; are not far from objective , a little later he reported that we held 9/10ths of hill &amp; that at midnight with fresh troops endeavour to capture remaining tenth The Connaught's are now in possession of the whole of their piece after desperate hard fighting.  The NZ's Bde have still to get a bit to the W. The Aust on the R through B trench have still a little to get.  Gen Russell captured a machine gun &amp; is using it against Turks.</p>

<p>We accomplished our objective although the Connaughts after capturing their positions couldnt hold them &amp; they retired then the ninth LH were sent to do the job which they did with 175 men after suffering 100 casualties, the whole of the new line have been consolidating throughout the day.  Artillery fire has been pretty prevalent throughout the day &amp; later on in the day, about 6 rounds [indecipherable] were fired into No 2 Section.  Monitors shelled Chunuk Bair for some time with 14" guns &amp; secondary armament.  Aeroplanes both ours out on reconnaissance on same section only ours drives enemy off after little manoeuvring.  Went for a dip as usual &amp; called in to see Ted H who was OK stores arriving by the boatload.  No sign of our reliefs as yet they got mixed up in the fight &amp; probably that may detain them.  Our Howitzers are to fire on Turks as soon as they open up with the 75 mm both on R &amp; the Left.  News of one of our submarines torpedoing 4 large Turkish transports in the straights above Nagara was received today.  The Turks were reinforcing their trenches on Hill 60 &amp; our artillery is giving em heaps</p>
