Two French soldiers of the visiting contingent are being entertained by French party & the restaurateurs. In return the soldiers sing songs & one of them has an exceptionally fine voice which makes the evening pass very agreeably until  1 pm  1 am when I start for last tube 
 19-7-19 This is the English date for the official celebrations of the Peace There is to be a procession similar to that at Paris but this of course will be mainly English - a tribute by the British nation to the victorious heroes. For this reason, Foch would not come across thinking he might detract from Haig's triumph a thoughtful & kindly act I think but is prevailed upon to come. 
 At Paris procession started 8-20 here at 10 am. At both cases it took about 2 hrs to pass. I have wonderful luck at 9 am I am in bed & at 10.15 am I am looking at procession from a position that many who have waited several hours cannot better
