 duplic the line as fast as fast as possibl . Peopl in Australia " thank Heaven " do not understand what it is like to be depriv of fuel thank to our warmer climat , the public suppli of coal is cut down to the lowest possibl limit and a good mani other thing besid , but still the French peopl never complain they are wonder patriot , and will sacrific everyth so that they may win the war , that is the spirit of Franc still today . For some reason or other we had no sugar in our tea today , this is the first time such a thing has happen to my memori sinc I have been in the Battalion . Went for a rout march this afternoon we usual walk about 2 mile out and then pull up , and have a spell and a yarn for an hour or so then fall in and march home again .
