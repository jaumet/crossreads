<p>These are just a few things I wanted to keep till I come home again, and I could not keep them myself very well &ndash; we are travelling very light. We have moved since I wrote the p.c. and are very near the line now. Expect to go in any time. Saw Niven marching through the village yesterday &ndash; just came out of trenches. Looked very well though tired. They had a hard time while they were in. Going back of &amp; now</p>
<p>Love from Alan.</p>
