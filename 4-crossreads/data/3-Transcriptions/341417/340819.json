<p>10.12.15<br/>I am finishing this letter in Camp having arrived here safely on Monday night. Clive Single was in the train coming up &amp; I saw him at the Continental Hotel the following night.<br/>We have been going like mad here since we came back getting the horses ready, regiment made up to strength etc etc. In the reshuffle I went to B Squadron &amp; have a good troop there. First mounted parade this morning &amp; no one fell off. My old horse has been destroyed I have two others but want a third.</p>
<p>I have been in to see Rania both nights in Camp, but am on duty tonight. Got measured for a uniform which is to be finished tomorrow, &amp; some new clothes. There are a cwt of parcels for me, only had time to open an odd, so can only send my general thanks for the lot.  I am going to try &amp; arrange to have them sent on. We are likely to move very soon, no spell for which I am rather pleased as I hate these training camps.<br/>Rania looks very well in spite of all her work.<br/>These nibs my batman brought are the limit. Have pockets full of letters, but have only had time to glance through them yet.</p>
