  
 afternoon. Went to a concert given by the Tommies in the night which was very good as they had a lot of professionals from London with them. 
 Their camps look very good as they spend a lot of their spare time in gardening and have made some very ornamental effects with cabbages & turnips, and the green relieves the bareness of the camp a lot.
