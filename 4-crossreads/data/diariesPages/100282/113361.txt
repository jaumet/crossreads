27th. We were to have had an early morning muster, but it rained heavily so spoilt everything.
In the afternoon "organised games a cross country run were on programe. The run was about 2 miles to my great surprise I finished 5th in the Company, Len was second, but wasn't I stiff after it, scarce could walk about. In the evening a party of us played "pontoon" till 11 oclock with varying fortune, Jack Hayes, Lindsay Graham, Jock Mackie, Lew, Bill Elder, Cameron a few more of the hard heads."
