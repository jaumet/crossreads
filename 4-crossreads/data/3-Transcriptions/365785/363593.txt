<p>direct from France, but I have wondered, failing to get any information from the men, I got into communication with our Enquiry Bureau only to find they had sent you word through the Sydney Office that the worst had happened &amp; you should have had Mer's letter &amp; Major Embletons long before this;  it is beautiful to think of the brilliant work he had done for others &amp; must take some of the sting away.  God comfort you Dear.<br/>My dear old Fellow is very well but his reg. had a fearful cutting up last time they were in action and one of his Sgts. of stretcher bearers told me had had a very narrow escape himself.  Sometimes one just wonders how much more we shall be able to endure.  I feel that if it were not for work &amp; prayers women would be filling lunatic asylums.<br/>Mer. got your parcel safely &amp; acknowledged it long ago, but as letters so often go astray it is as well for me to do so too, it was good of you to think of him in the midst of all your work.<br/>Yes the Referendum was a crushing</p>
