<p>picquet though I have mounted picquet to act as relief when the appointed picquet was absent.<br/>One of our lads named Hooker was absent all day yesterday and has not turned up this morning. He has not been seen since Monday night when we were shelled out of the stable, the last seen of him he was running up the road. He was sent here because he was supposed to have shell shock.<br/>Before dark last night a big 15 in gun came to Nieppe &amp;amp fired a number of shots at the enemies positions. After that it was taken away again by the armoured train; apparently it done its job well for no more shells is coming over from Fritz this morning. The other guns on the railway also retired. About 12. a.m. Fritz sent over a number of H. E. and gas shells. They fell near the railway.<br/>This morning I saw an air fight in the far distance. The report of the machine guns in action drew our attention to it, all our planes returned safely. The enemy also escaped. At one time one of our planes was engaged by 6 of the enemy and escaped.<br/>No papers came here yesterday or to day. Apparently the paper boys were frightened by Fritz's shelling of this place on Monday &amp;amp Tuesday.<br/>There was another aeroplane duel this morning. 15 of the enemies planes attacked by 9 ours near hit but they all came home safe. The archies were watching them through their glasses.</p>
