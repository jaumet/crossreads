Monday 25 MarchAstir early & caught train to Glasgow.
Walked about until struck Overseas Club. Book beds etc. Visited North [indecipherable] Engine Works. [Note at bottom of page] Saw 6", 8" shells, aeroplane engines being machined. Afternoon walked about again & finally finished up by having a swim.
Evening to Opera. Carl Rosa Coy. Madame Butterfly. Not too bad.
