  
 We also visited the Sphinx & the temple alongside of it in which the floors are composed of Alabaster stone I managed to procure a piece. There are temples & wells & tombs & villages all over the place & the sight of the huge masses of stone & granite make anyone wonder how they managed to get them here & the tools they must have used. There is some excavation work going on in one of the ancient cities now by some American syndicate. While at the top of the big pyramid I carved my name on a rock up there. There are pyramids all over the place but none as huge as the two that we can see from the camp. There is a big hotel here called Mena house hotel but is now converted into a hospital for the sick soldiers there is a fair sized swimming bath at the rear of the hotel where we go for bathing parades.
