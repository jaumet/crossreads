<p>June 20th<br/>Major Starnes sent me to look for a billet on the further side of the town.  Took Sgt. Brophy (Can) with me.  We chose one that perhaps will be suitable on the further side of the city on the high ground.  Had some difficulty in getting into the courtyard.  First knocked which brought a woman who squealed &amp; then ran.  The old man came after a lot of persuasion &amp; let us in.  He first of all cleared all the women &amp; absolutely shook with fear until we gave him some cigs.  He then gave us tea.  Evidently the Russians gave these people a pretty bad time, for he told us that we were 'so different from the Russian Officers'  and apparently felt quite safe before we left.</p>
<p>June 21st<br/>Rested all day.  Capt Fisher set off for Hamadan.</p>
