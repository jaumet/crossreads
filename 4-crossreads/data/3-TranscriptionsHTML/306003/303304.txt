<p>29.3.16<br/>Wed 29th<br/>Nelson turned up here this morning &amp; we asked (Kamel) the owner of the village if we could use the top of one of the houses in the village to signal from &amp; he said yes as long as he was always present when we wanted to go through the houses;  We had no trouble to get in touch with Turkh-El-Kheil, but failed to get into communication with Ezbet-Soo-Doon &amp; cannot understand why as I fancy we can see the village of Ezbet-Soo-Doon quite plainly through the glasses;</p>
<p>We were paid this morning &amp; a good quantity of beer drank by some of the lads;  Saddler Jones got fighting drunk &amp; we decided to have some sport with him, so I challenged to box him &amp; then went out to him after a very amusing round;  Beer is now 7 PT a bottle &amp; the Canteen owner made more money today than he has ever made before in his life</p>
