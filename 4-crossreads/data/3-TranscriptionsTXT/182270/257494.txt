 TUESDAY, JULY 1, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; cold wind. Burning off in 
 Middle till dinner time then 
 round the paddocks. I took 
 Tickle over today &amp; pay him 
 35/- per week, &amp; start to run the 
 place on its own. George finished 
 concreeting the troughs at Boundary 
 &amp; has to wait a few days for them 
 to dry.
