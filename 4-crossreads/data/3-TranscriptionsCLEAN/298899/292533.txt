Tuesday 30th Oct.  Had a good sleep during the day and loaded one train at night. Things fairly busy. Taubes over at night.
Wednesday 31st Oct  Had a day out with another Sg here. He took me round to see his old haunts in the neighbourhood walking miles. Had a good & merry time arriving back in time for two hours sleep. Loaded one train at night. Taubes over & had this crowd properly frightened. I never witnessed so much terror as shewn by this C.C.S. An Aerodrome about 1 1/2 miles away was bombed
Thursday 1st Nov.  Went for a walk in the morning but turned in at 11 A.M. Taubes over again & caught some of our artillery. More casualties from bombs than the line during the night. Trench feet much in evidence, Gas cases also being numerous. Loaded two trains during the night getting 320 cases away.
