<p>26 May, 1916<br/>Kantara<br/>Stayed  alnight at YMCA &ndash; No blankets, its not much of a place at all though every one is very good,  Its hard to get water &amp; theres no where to go to get a cup of tea, I felt that dirty when I got up, so I went down to the canal &amp; had a swim &amp; felt much refreshed then I bought some sausages &amp; fruit &amp; [indecipherable] had breakfast &ndash; I was told that the Regiment had left Romanai this morning at 3 am so it was no use putting the stuff on the train until we knew of their destination,  I went down to Rail head by the 12 noon train returning by the 5.0 pm &amp; brought the bandeliers  &amp; Rifles back with me.  Arrangements were fixed up for our stuff to be taken to the Reg with a lot of Gift Stuff in charge of Col Woods the Clergyman.  The Reg I learned is at hill 70</p>
