<p>cold weather the night especially.</p>
<p>Saturday 16th Sept.<br/>O.S. for the day &amp; was kept fairly busy.  Had a bad headache most of the day one of my bad bilious ones.  Drove the Ford up to the trenches at night &amp; went up to the advanced dressing station.  At present we are situated in some ruins made habitable by means of sand bags about 600 yds from the German 1st line of trenches.  Here the wounded are dressed &amp; carried back to where the Ambulance waits.  'Tis a beautiful spot surrounded by trees but could be blown out of existance with a couple of shells at any time.  As it is a machine gun often rakes it with fire but the sandbags are sufficient for them.  The road is screened off at different places with hessian.  Coming back we passed a lot of waggons taking up ammunition quite a busy scene and as no lights are allowed.  Very careful driving is required in the dark.</p>
<p>Sunday 17th Sept<br/>Had leave for the day so borrowed a bike &amp; rode to "Poperinghe" in Belgium in order to see Morris D. and other members of the A.I.S. who had just returned from the Somme.  It was a most enjoyable ride the weather being good &amp; the country looking fine.</p>
