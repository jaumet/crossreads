<p>27 July 1918 Saturday (Whole page crossed out)<br/>Last night a wire came from General Chauvel congratulating me on D.S.O.   I sent word to the little wife to cable you- all night Cables have been coming to me &amp; other Officers ringing me up.   I am greatly bucked &amp; it will help me to carry on &amp; do my job.  Posted notes yesterday &amp; just had time to add the D.S.O. but it will be published in Australia &amp; I will be found in Debretts WHOS WHO etc etc- Vanity all perhaps-  but we are but humans.  Went to dinner at Cavalry School Mess in Richon once the old Town Hall built by Rothschild, a nice place.</p>
