in by shell fire, one day I had ten men we came to where my party had been told off to clear away the debris we stretched out each man having so much work to do 
it was about 9.30 when we got there in the morning we worked very hard until 1 oclock the place I was working at was a real good find for us as when I put the pick into the ground I discovered boxes of Bombs Ammunition also a bag of very lights flare pistol also two jars of Rum, one had been opened the other was full uncorked, so after having a nip as I could never stand much of it as it is too strong burns ones throat I passed it along the line of men they were glad of a nip as we had to unearth three dead men who had been buried inside the trench, we put them in a waterproof sheet each put them in shell holes covered them up, so the rum came in Handy to take out the taste of dead men, which is far from pleasant.
One of the other parties had bad luck as 9 out of 10 got wounded, but I got all my party back safely. I may mention that the other jar of rum was commandeered by three officers I never saw any more of it. 
This sort of carrying up rations to the men in the front line is dangerous as the enemy can see from his balloons if any movements are taking place in our trenches he soon gets some guns to shell the communication Trenches so a lot of men are lost even on that sort of work carrying up rations etc; 
We stayed in the support line 10 days when we were relieved by some of the 6th Brigade we were shelled all the
