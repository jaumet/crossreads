It is interesting to note how much they are going in for outdoor exercise, sports , etc. all of which are quite new to the nation as a whole.

Thurs. 7.30am:had plenty of rain On Tuesday with a heavy rainstorm in the afternoon & yesterday was also pretty bad - cold, windy & raining. The majority of the tents stood the strain well although I don't think they will last the winter.
