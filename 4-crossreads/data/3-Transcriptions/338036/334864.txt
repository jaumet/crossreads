<p>Friday 19th<br/>Preparing to go to A.D.S. tonight.  Sam returned from Gas School today (Casson).  At night 7 of us including Ernie Lawless, Wag Howard   [indecipherable] Wilf Boyles, Rosenthal left the Baths by Ambulance Car and arrived at ADS about &frac12; hour later.  Slept on stretcher.  Rats galore.</p>
<p>Saturday 20th<br/>When I awoke it was icy cold and the snow which has been on ground for days is still frozen over.  After breakfast I was appointed water picket and which [while] on that job our artillery opened fire just nearby kicking up a deuce of noise.  Shells commenced to fly about &amp; Fritz replied later.  It was hard to distinguish Fritzs from ours.  One chap brought up by our R.A.P. bearers with one leg off.</p>
<p>The Tommies coming out are comical and cut some funny figures.  Such remarks as, Have a monkey [indecipherable].  Have some butterscotch etc when they havnt a cent is typical.  This picket game is no bon as plaster falls off the wall all over you</p>
