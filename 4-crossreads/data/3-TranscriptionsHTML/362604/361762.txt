<p>or the next day.  Give my Best wishes to all our neighbours.</p>
<p>Poor Jim Vernon, the marathon winner, was killed some weeks ago in France.  I met a Manly chap in Salisbury the other day who met Os Merritt in New York.  I forgot to ask His name as I was in a devil of a Hurry.  He knew me well but He was only a boy when I left.  Well, Toot-el-loo.  I must be off.</p>
<p>Fond Love<br/>Harry.</p>
