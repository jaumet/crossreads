I got a fairly fast train from Littlehampton & in about 3 hours was back in London.  I walked down to Peel House & put my bags & etc. in the Store Room & then rushed for a train to Victoria & thence by tube to Picadilly where I slipped round to the Pavilion & booked a seat for "As you were" a very popular piece at present.  This left me with a little over an hour to spare so I went round to the Maison Lyons for dinner.  Here I met a couple of good stamps of English officers but they were born & brought up in the Malay Penisular.  This is the slowest flaming place I ever put my foot into as regards service, we were exactly an hour getting through 2 courses.  This place like the Strand Corner House is just a meeting place for girls & gossip & it generally takes an hour & a half to get a dinner.  However we finished at last & then made off for the theatre.  I like Dalyisia she is bonza in "As you were".
