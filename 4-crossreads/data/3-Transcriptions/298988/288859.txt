The Queen is firing continuously from her forward guns, whilst on the after part of her the Jack Tars are kicking a little football about &ndash; Pretty cool alright.  I took a photograph of her firing.  I had a look ashore through a Telescope &amp; can plainly see our men on the mountain (thousands of them).  They have big trenches dug with bomb &amp; shrapnel proof covers over them, whilst further along the guns of the mountain battery can be seen well entrenched &amp; every few seconds one of the guns are fired &amp; a flash of flame bursts forth.  Just ahead of them the enemy's shrapnel keeps bursting &amp; shells are coming right over the ridge &amp; landing in the water near the H.M.S. Baccchante, about 500 yards ahead of us.  It got too close for her &amp; she has just shifted out.  On the beach there is a mine-sweeper which the enemy sank, only the tops of her funnel &amp; masts showing.  But the most remarkable of all is the fact that a lot of Australians are in swimming.  I suppose they are the night-shift for the trenches, but its pretty coolheaded</p>
