 Wednesday 28 November 
 Fine still.  Caught train at 9.10 a.m. at Gare Du Nord travelling 1st Class, Dinner between Abbeville and Boulogne.  American War Correspondent yarning to us in the carriage.  At Calais we had a couple of hours to wait so we strolled round the town a bit and had tea at the Church Army rooms.  3rd Class to Hazebrouck.  Here we were informed that the train would not be going any further tonight so we tipped an M.P. and he put us in a 1st Class carriage of the train which leaves tomorrow morning at 6.46 a.m. for Bailleul.  This constitutes our bed for the night
