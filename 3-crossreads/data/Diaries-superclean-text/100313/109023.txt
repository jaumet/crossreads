strike the hours. From the Strand up to here is a mass of splendid shops and one cannot but marvel at this array of commerce. To the Bank of England, low windowless and squat where beadles in cocked hats and old uniforms were strolling round. The Exchange was placarded with the results of war saving campaigns in the country towns. To the Bank of Australasia to see if there were any letters and there met Mr. Blogg who asked us to come and have a chop with him. Now to the old Cock Tavern for a meal of boiled mutton caper sauce and a pint of bitter. An old fashioned place and full of old fashioned people ? here we met and English officer and drank some port with him after our lunch, going upstairs to an old sanded floored smoking room. Now by bus to Wandsworth
