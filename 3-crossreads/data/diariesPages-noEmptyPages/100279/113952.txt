10 th. Another inspection parade this morning all overcoats had to be cleaned, it took me would you believe 3 hours to clean mine even then it was in a dreadful state, but good enough for me yes "we have some mud alright up here on the Somme." In fact I have been practically all day long cleaning up my belongings even now they look dirty, such is a soldier's life anyhow.
I laid in bed this morning till just on 8 oclock for I felt far from well, Jack Price brought me up a nice plate of porridge after eating this I felt much better, I don't want to go to the Dr. just yet for various reasons, but if things don't improve with me I shall have to go pay him a visit.
