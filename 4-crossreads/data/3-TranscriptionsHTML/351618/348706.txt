<p>I said "good Bye" in case our Unit might be called away at any moment. Things are still very unsettled several of our guys have gone away &amp; a batch of men. There are wild rumours that there is to be another landing etc. On hardly knows what to think.</p>
<p>While on my way to Ordinance this afternoon I found that there was a free distribution of anything one required. There was about 200 men ransacking the stores there &amp; it was amusing to see the Punjaubies taking away a dozen pairs of boots. The waste was really shameful &amp; I consider a systematic distribution could have been made &amp; ensured that those who required these items got them. In view of the usual red tape formalities to get Ordnance goods in this part when men really required</p>
