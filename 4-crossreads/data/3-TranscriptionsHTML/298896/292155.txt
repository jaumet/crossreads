<p>Saturday 31st 1918</p>
<p>We ceased to be the M.D.S. at 10 A.M. the 8th having moved forward &amp; opened up near Cappy, the A.D.S. has also moved to the left, our division taking over from the 2nd Division thus bringing us to the Somme again. During the day I forwarded by motor lorry all my drugs &amp; dressings to the new M.D.S. it was a full load. Loaded our waggons during the day ready to move off again. Matters still going well with the advance &amp; a party of over 700 prisoners passed about 5.30. Latest reports are 120,000 prisoners &amp; 2000 guns. Towards dusk, hundreds of our aeroplanes going home fly low over our heads &amp; many do hair raising feats such as looping &amp; flying corkscrew fashion, diving etc. Hun bombing planes over last night but no bombs close.</p>
<p>Sunday 1st September</p>
<p>Had a day of rest awaiting orders which I filled by writing, doing up a parcel for home &amp; going for a stroll after tea. Also had an interesting time watching planes which were using the field</p>
