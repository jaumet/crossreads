<p>I think that if the armed &amp; organised troops had been marched in, the MP's might have called themselves lucky to see another day, as the soldier who would lift a hand to help them has not yet arrived in Seymour. As it was they got off well, only suffering about 85% casualties. Today we were all scattered through the wide world digging trenches and several units that figured largely got marching orders &amp; are packing.</p>
<p>It serves the Powers-that-be right for cramping thousands of men in a place like this, half fed &amp; badly housed, &amp; then putting these cold footed beauties round them like warders in a convict prison. Even the law-abiding public here has grown to hate them &amp; refused them sanctuary when chased.</p>
<p>Thus, if the warm weather holds, we expect to have quite a good camp in Seymour ere long. It's already becoming lively enough to be interesting. We are unanimous in saying this is the first week that all have thoroughly enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p>You mustn't  worry about these alarums &amp; excursions in Seymour City. They provide much laughter -  a valued commodity in Vic.</p>
<p>With much love to self and all<br/>Harry</p>
