to Damn our rest days in this Country. and you watch, before this war is over, the old party who made all these rotten rules and Regs, and misnamed them Discipline will get a Shock. There'll be such a flare up. that the Heads will open their eyes. The first seeds have been sown. You saw what a mob could be like when roused at home, we have seen it again at wareham last year, and again not far from here this Year. There will certainly be more. Now I will have to ring off. When you go over to Goonigal give them all my Love, and wish them heaps of good Luck for 1918 from me. Tell them Im Still O.K. and hope to get back someday. Love and best wishes to all at Home and just tell them not to worry too much. best of Luck from your Affec Bro Chas
Have never bumped up against any of the old Maroubra mob. Spose you know that Ted Mackensen is a Loot in the first Bn. Now. I believe he is away in Blighty just at Present at one of the training Depots.
