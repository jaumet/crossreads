<p>c/o The Australian Commonwealth Office Horseferry Road London 8.12.1915<br/>Dear Marg,<br/>Got your letter dated 1st Aug. on the 5th Decr   &amp; was sorry to hear that a blacklist cow in the paddock had got you bluffed by staring at you.  I had a great time on Furlough   &amp; saw Killarney lakes   &amp; Giants Causeway.  Was also staying with our Aunts in Londonderry   &amp; have been to Dublin  &amp; Brighton, also stayed some time in London.  There is an advertisement in one of the tube railways under London which amused me &ndash; it was a lot of rabbits diving into a burrow   &amp; had "we all go the same way home" under it &ndash; they are very handy for getting about though.  I used to think if I went to London I would get lost, but got on alright by asking the way occasionally.  I suppose you know it is very dark at night all over the London</p>
