<p>Saturday 24 March 1917 [23 March 1918]<br/>&frac12; day and a very enjoyable one.  Went Barrage 1.30 train with "Frank", took snaps, 4 p.m. tea then strolled round in the pretty gardens and met Sister &amp; Mr. Jim Parkins 6 p.m. tea then long and thoughtful conversation on many things in life, on the bridge, finally home to Cairo 9.30 p.m. train &amp; at 27th G.H. (with Miss Dent) 10.40 p.m.  A pretty &amp; peaceful day.<br/>All the willows are coming into leaf and katkins hanging their soft green tassels along the swaying branches &ndash; very pretty the gardens look by moonlight.<br/>Returned by 9.30 p.m. train &amp; home with Miss Dent, 10.45 p.m.<br/>A hint as to a "squeeze &amp; a kiss" is very promptly squashed but am not a bit sure what am really dealing with.  Not a St. Anthony though of that am sure.</p>
