Dear old Mick,
Many thanks for your letter labelled "Broadmeadows" which I received at Colombo.  It was all the more appreciated, because it happened to be the only word I received from home.
Well, Mick, I suppose you shall have started your year's work for the Senior, before you get this.  You must write & tell me all about your work, the set books, etc.  I dare say you will do all right but I would advise you to bog in to French right from the start.  Craig, you remember, neglected this [?] very tricky subject and consequently his Dec.-March holiday was spoilt by his having to do the Matric. in this subject.  Have had cards etc. from Kath Begbie, Enid Chandler.  Ask them over to tennis as often as you can.  My kind regards to all the chaps at school.
Best love to all fromEver your loving brotherEric
