<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Friday 22</p>
<p>My turn to wait at table &amp; managed to get through with nothing worse than spilling rice all over the table.</p>
<p>Very easy job, for tomorrow I simply clean a dug &ndash; out &amp; get some water &amp; then "Finish".</p>
<p>Started raining in afternoon.</p>
<p>Very miserable day.  Feeling rather sick.</p>
