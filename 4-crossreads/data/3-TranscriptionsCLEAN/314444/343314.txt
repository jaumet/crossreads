Feb.14th   Just received another letter from you dated Jan 9.  Also one from Ruth, glad to know everything is O.K.
We are expecting to pay Abdul a visit in a few days at a place some 50 miles east of here.  No doubt it will be a good go as we are getting into his own territory.  Will write again & tell you all about it.
