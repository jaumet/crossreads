<p>At 4pm with a full passenger list the steamer drew away from the wharf, steamed slowly down the Yarra and so to the Bay.  Anchored near the mouth of the river midway between Williamstown &amp; Port Melbourne was the dear old Bulla.  We passed within a few boats lengths of her.  Travelling at 17 knots it was not long however before she was out of sight.  Shall I ever see her again?  Whether I do or not, memories of her are the sweetest.  The best part of a year spent on her was the most valuable &amp; educational period of my 20 years of existence.</p>
