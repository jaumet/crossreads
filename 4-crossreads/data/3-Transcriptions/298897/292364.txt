<p>Wednesday 13th Sept.<br/>Had an off day so did some washing &amp; mending.  In the afternoon went for a ride on the w.o's horse &amp; enjoyed myself immensely notwithstanding the fact that coming home I was caught in the rain &amp; received a drenching.  Had a good meal of fish caught in the river Lys.  For some reason the fish appear to be dazed &amp; float on the top of the water.   As they float past with the current the chaps simply lift them out with nets.  They are of all sizes &amp; make a splendid dish for active service.</p>
<p>Thursday 14th Sept<br/>O.S. for the day &amp; was kept going all day having a very energetic orderly officer.  Received a strange "turn" in the afternoon.  As the rain was beating in on my bed one of the caps covered it over with a waterproof &amp; coming in later it appeared to me as a shroud &amp; a feeling of apprehension ran through me so much that I took it off &amp; folded it up.  Later on in the day the news of a forthcoming stunt being told me brought back the same feeling.  For myself I do not fear the worst but for my mother.  When I think what trouble I could bring on my people it almost makes me a coward.</p>
<p>Friday 15th Sept<br/>Had a day at dispensing again for a change.  Nothing much doing mostly rec's for battalions.  Very</p>
