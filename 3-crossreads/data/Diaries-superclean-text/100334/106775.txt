Piston comes down on to the Wheel one on each side and is fixed on to a crank and between the Wheels underneath is a cogwheel with cogwheels on each side to the next Axle and by this method the Wheels are forced around going at a speed between 8 and 10 miles an hour. This Locomotive is well worth seeing, and in Glass Cases is Models of all kinds of Pumps, and Stationary Engines, and up to date Locomotives, all in working order, obtaining the power by compressed air, which is forced into the Cylinders and Steam Chests. An attendant came along and set them all going, and they looked well all working, in another portion of the building is models of modern steamers and beautifully finished off and are very pleasing to the Eye. The Painting and Workmanship of all these Models reflect great credit on the Makers and are very interesting to view. I spent a most enjoyable two hours here and intend paying another visit later on. I returned to Holborn for Lunch
