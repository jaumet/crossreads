<p>21st Weather is very nice and fine. Foliage is beautifully green.  Lts. Shaw and McMeekin are being tried for neglect of duty. Wrote and asked the General for special leave. It was refused in an uncourteous manner. Second DIV.D.A.D.O.S. appears to me to be of more help to he Germans than to us, cannot get necessary stores. Clothes indented for and obtained for men now dead or wounded D.A.D.O.S. refused to have returned and informed me that I should have to pay for them. Was there ever anything more absurd.</p>
<p>22nd Fired a few rounds. Lt. CHEADLE killed out scouting. ARMENTIERS had a few shells put into it, one killed a father, mother, and children. Scouts say they are more afraid of their own men than of Germans.</p>
