Tuesday 13th November 1917
Posted notes yesterday - telling you I'm here till 19th. Laura comes at 2.30 to see us, & goes Hospital tonight.
Brace is coming to see her & she says Connie is ill too but Laura is a bit of a Hypochondriac if that spells it correctly.
Foggy morning my cold better & the wife very fit. A luxurious life at present.
In Palestine several of my friends have been killed.
