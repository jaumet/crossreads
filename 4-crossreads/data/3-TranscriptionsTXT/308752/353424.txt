 Ever since leaving the Rest Station it has been rather an interesting trip. There has been absolutely no danger at all, it has been just as safe as if walking down George Street. To day we had plenty of work clearing up the rubbish in the building &amp; making the Dressing Station a little respectable.  You cannot imagine what a fearful condition the houses are in, every house resembles a rubbish tip &amp; Fritz was evidently fond of booze judging by the thousands of bottles lying about. A number of wounded passed through the Dressing Station to day, all brought good news from the front, the enemy is still retiring. Great news from the French Front also.
