of the doctor.xxxxxxWhen the doctor came to me, he inspected the foot & pronounced it not yet healthy;  then by way of talking of Australia (he is an Australian) he asked me if I knew Southport.That is a town I have never visited.  I have passed through it by train, nay more, for the train changes its direction there & there is a halt for refreshments.A nice clean bushy seaside town, with the beautiful Pacific washing its shores & health giving tonic in its air.Of course I knew.Then Toowoomba, did I know that town.
