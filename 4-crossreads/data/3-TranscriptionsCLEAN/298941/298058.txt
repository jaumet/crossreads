  
 front again, I have had a subconscious feeling that worse was to come, & I now feel that the Supreme & last ordeal is before me, & it will soon be over. I pray that it will be God's will for me to be spared, but am quite resigned in any case. Tuesday Line this afternoon. Now in charge of a squad.
