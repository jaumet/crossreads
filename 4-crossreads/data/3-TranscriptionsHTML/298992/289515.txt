<p>Much to the amusement of some of the boys round about. Its OK to day though a little bruised. If I don't get worse than that I'll be alright! I saw Niven a week or so ago. His Batt had been in the trenches, &amp; had a rather rough passage, and as they marched through the village where we were billotted they looked about fagged. I spotted Niven, &amp; waltzed across to him, and had a yarn for a while. He looked tired but was otherwise quite well. We all look tired here, on account of the broken sleep we get, while in the front line, you may go 4 or 5 days and not have any sleep at all. Coleridge Harvey is in the trenches now, and was O.K. last night. Harvey heard nothing of Reg or Harold. Les Wynne is well also. Well Father the guns here are making an awful row and the vibration is annoying, so I'll end off for the present. Tell Mother not to worry, as I'm first class, and somehow I have a feeling that I won't be knocked have had it all along, and have been lucky so far. Hope to hear of Dene soon, has he left I wonder?</p>
<p>With Love to you all</p>
<p>Your son Alan</p>
