 Saturday 3 March 
 Frosty and bitterly cold this morning.  Left for Heilly at 9 a.m. with General Service Waggon &amp; clothes to be exchanged.  From Heilly I went into Corbie and returned to Bellevue Farm by motor lorry which was drawing a 6 inch howitzer along.  Corbie is about 18 Kilos from Albert. After tea went to picture show in Albert.
