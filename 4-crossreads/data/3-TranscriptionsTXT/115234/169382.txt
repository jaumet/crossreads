 &#39;Tis indeed a sombre ruin, the place you once called Home 
 Alas, theres many suchlike on the main road to  Bapaume  
 What once was smiling country side is now a blasted plain 
 Given o&#39;er to Crows &amp; rats &amp; human moles who bring misery in their train 
 So little [????], a fond adieu, I&#39;ve loitered more than seemly 
 Some day will come the reckoning &amp; the score will blot out cleanly 
 Thus moralising do I pass, a soldier from Australia
