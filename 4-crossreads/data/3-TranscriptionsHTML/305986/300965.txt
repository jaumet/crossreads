<p>Everyone speaks of the Anzacs<br/>Of their wonderful brave display<br/>But does anyone hear of the Surrey Boys?<br/>Who were up in Sulva Bay?<br/>Their work was good and dangerous<br/>Their Trials and conditions hard<br/>But they have not been feted in London<br/>Or cheered on the French boulevarde<br/>No they are working damned hard out in Egypt<br/>From civilisation away<br/>In the farthest unsanitary quarters<br/>Where the Arab himself will not stay<br/>But Tommy's the boy to be cheerful<br/>And work like a slave night &amp; day<br/>And put up with sauce for a tanner<br/>Not six bob that's Anzac's Pay</p>
