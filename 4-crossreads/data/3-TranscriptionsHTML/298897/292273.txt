<p>after going about 4 or 5 miles.  After the infantry advanced we set off in stretcher squads being led by one of our Captains who promptly led us to a flank away from everyone.  We then discovered that the engagement was over so we returned after plugging though deep sand for about 3 miles.  No wounded were seen although I believe the other ambulance came across a number.  Returned to camp about midday.  Nothing doing during afternoon.  We had camel &amp; mule carts with which to carry wounded    practically a desert equipment.</p>
