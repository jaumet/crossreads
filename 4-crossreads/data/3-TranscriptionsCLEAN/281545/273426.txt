  
 Train into the yard at Lillers to allow two important Troop Trains to pass.   After I had another Hot Dinner I went into the Sergeants Mess at 6.30 where the Depot Concert Party gave us a treat.   The place was full of N.C.O.'s & the individual members of the Party gave us several good turns all of which were well appreciated.   There were several Professional Artist amongst them, the Concert terminated at 9.30 with 3 cheers for the Party & all hands retired for the night. 
 Sunday 10th.   I had another enjoyable ride on the Eng in lovely weather to Bethune arriving there on time, where I left my chums, as they wished to have a look at the Locomotive sheds & I intended to have a look at the Cemetery past the Canal I made my way up into the Square & inquired the way & soon arrived at the Canal, where several Steam Tugs were lying alongside the Wharf.  It is very pretty along this Canal the grass being nice & green on the sloping back in between the Wharfs.  Having crossed the Canal, I came to the entrance to the Cemetery which is surrounded by a high brick wall & there are two large Iron Gates which were opened & in I walked along the road.   There are Pine Trees on each side growing which add to the beauty & the Marble Tombs, & Head Stones & Glass Houses glittered in the Sun
