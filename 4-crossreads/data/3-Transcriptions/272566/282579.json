<p>Monday 14 May</p>
<p>Showery but otherwise very warm.  Successful day on the motor bike.  Fritz threw a few shells on the road near our camp.  The chief event of the day was a brilliant piece of work in the air to Fritz's credit.  A plane flew over us at about 7000 ft. high &ndash; Our guns fired at him but didn't seem to hit him.  However he pretended to be knocked and fell over &amp; over sideways until he came very low.  Meantime we were all yelling with delight.  Suddenly the plane righted itself and made off home followed by our battleplane.<br/>The opinion has been advanced that this plane intended to dive at one of our balloons by means of the joke.</p>
