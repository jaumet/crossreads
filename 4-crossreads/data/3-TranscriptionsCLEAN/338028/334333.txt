Sunday 2md July
My AMC men came back from Port Said, the rest of this Elgshen moved from Tek to Moascar near Ishmalen which is a good camp. Alas of promotions went through to-day, the r.q.m. and the sig sgs got their lieutencises. At ten pm the 5th got an order to go out and capture some Turks and Camels, they moved off splendidly.
