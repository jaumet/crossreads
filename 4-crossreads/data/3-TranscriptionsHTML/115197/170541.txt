<p>to that sound which:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Growing louder, shriller, clearer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proclaims the heavy shell as it draws nearer.&quot;</p>
<p>This huge wave merely proves to be the first of many which sweep our decks throughout the day.</p>
<p>Night approaches, but the anger of the sea does not abate.&nbsp; Strange though it may seem, it is the same vast stretch of water.</p>
<p>&quot;That running by the Castle of Old Windsor, reflects mirror-like the trees that line the river&#39;s banks.</p>
