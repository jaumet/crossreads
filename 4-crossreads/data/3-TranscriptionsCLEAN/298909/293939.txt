  
 notice - Thousands of men leaving for unknown destinations daily, the Camps are almost deserted & Cairo is feeling the pinch - I am certain - we that is camps at Zeitoun - Helmieh expect to get marching orders any minute. 
 Had another dose of Typhus vacceine today - arm very sore.  Couldn't get to church today. 
 3rd  Monday 
 Very cold last night - stiff breeze blowing - All the Camp on various fatigues - I happened to be without a party, so made myself scarce all day. Leave still stopped, went to a picture show at Zeitouin at night. Had a check roll during the day.
