My dear Judge,We have just received the official intimation that [indecipherable] ship is expected to arrive in Melbourne on 4th August I suppose if the boat is up to time he will be here on 6th or 7th August. They may of course be sent over by train
Unfortunately we are in a difficulty as my son Arthur is down at my house with pneumonia influenza & is very bad. Mrs. Lucas is also down with influenza of the milder type but is also having a severe attack. I am alright so far & hope I shall be able to meet him. Dr. Lamrock is attending to them both.
Yours sincerelyE. Lucas
