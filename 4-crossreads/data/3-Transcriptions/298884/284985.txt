<p>charge of a piquet of four men. I have never heard of such rot in my life before.  It was a broiling afternoon. I could feel the heat gnawing its way to my very inside &amp; I was one continual lather. I was told that we would be inspected at 4.30pm but nobody came along so I wandered up to the barracks about 5pm to find out what was doing &amp; I met Brolga dashing along on a rickshaw he yelled out that my piquet was recalled &amp; that I had better trot along to the boat so</p>
