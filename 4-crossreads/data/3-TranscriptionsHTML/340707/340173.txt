<p>45<br/>on which peace is to be signed &amp; I go to Versaille to take part in this wondrous event. I go via Montparnasse &amp; so miss much of the crowd though there are over 50,000 there but these are a mere handful in the vast grounds of the Palace.</p>
<p>To describe Versaille is impossible &amp; God knows what kind of intellect it was which fashioned it. It is stupendous &amp; cost about &pound;20,000,000 &amp; has accomodation for 10,000 inmates The approach has 16 colossal statutes perhaps 20 ft high of statesmen &amp; soldier of Louis XV &amp; in the centre is a statue of the Grand Monarch himself. Each of the pavilions are inscribed with "To the great glories of France" but this is probably by Louis XV</p>
<p>The Broad Avenue de Paris is lined with thousand of blue clad, steel helmeted cavalry who are guarding every road. The Palace itself is out of bounds save with a ticket which I do not possess</p>
<p>The grounds are one complicated mass of tree covered avenues &amp; thickets &amp; shrubberies &ndash; with temple &amp; fountains &amp; sculptures every at unexpected places Over 100 sculptors were employed embellishing the grounds</p>
<p>At 10 to 4 the battery of artillery commences. This is signal that peace has been signed &amp; then plenipotentiaries file out &amp; into the terrace &amp; simultaneously the fountains commence to play &ndash; &amp; a majestic sight they are though big ones are not in action</p>
