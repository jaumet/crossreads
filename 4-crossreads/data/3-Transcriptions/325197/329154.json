<p>Wed 7th August 1918<br/>Mounted guard at 10am. In the evening we were told to fall in and a letter from some General was read out to us about the Big Push which starts tomorrow morning, and asking the Boys to do their duty etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Thur 8th Aug. 1918<br/>Still on Guard, went on the 4 to 6am shift this morning., and the roar of the aeroplanes passing over our camp in the hundreds going in the direction of the front line, made one wonder how Fritz was faring.</p>
<p>The horizon was lit up by the flashes from our guns, and just on daybreak I could see thousands of Cavalry going along the road. The rumble of the tanks, and the ammunition one could see going up to the line, made one say Well Fritz you are going to get something you have been asking for, for quite a long time.</p>
