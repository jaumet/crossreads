France 13.3.18.
Many thanks for your letter of 6th Jan, Bett. I think that I told Mother all about Xmas. New Year. etc in previous letters so will not go into any description of it here, there is little news, except that yours truly is still the same as last time, comfortably quartered, not overworked, and enjoying the warm sunshiny weather that has been the order of the day for some days past, it seems almost too good to be true, Went for a walk to the top of a fairly high hill, near here on Sunday but did not get a very extensive view of the surrounding country owing to the heavy haze that was everywhere one looked. Just like the smoke haze, one sees so much of in Aussie, during the bush fire season
