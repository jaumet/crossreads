  
 19th Up very early, and found that there is a perfect fleet round us.  Transports, cruisers, battleships, destroyers, all are here.  As we started off we ran foul of a French transport, and were tangled up in a perfect mess for over an hour.  Then the guns began again, and soon we saw our airmen flying high over the Turkish trenches and guns, giving our guns range, direction, etc.  Then shrapnel shells begin to burst near the machine  and  but our aviator goes sailing calmly on.  Soon an officer comes on board with our orders, and we are off, twelve miles further up the coast.  At 7.30 we have arrived, and cast anchor.  We are now a few hundred yards away from Anzac, where we are to land to-morrow, and where the Australian infantry have made for themselves and Australia a name that will never die. 
 There was an incessant crackle of rifle and machine guns last night on shore.  A fierce fight was fought all night.
