<p>Dear Lock,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve sent you two registered envelopes care of the Crown St Post Office with four sets of cards. &nbsp;I hope you get them safely. &nbsp;I think you will be taken on with them. &nbsp;Today has been mild, but we manage to get our brazier going all the same.</p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing to mention, I hope you are well and having plenty of business.</p>
<p>Fondest regards,</p>
<p>Your loving Cousin,</p>
<p>Jim Drummond</p>
