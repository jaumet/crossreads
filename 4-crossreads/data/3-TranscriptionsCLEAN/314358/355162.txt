 If by nothing else by the presence of that peace which hallows each 
 It is carpeted soft and brown, this wood, with a mat of fallen needles from the pines. 
 The texture of this glorious carpet is varied and is pattern changed by the interweaving of withered bracken fronds thrust in by the wild witches of the bleak winter winds from the moorlands; and by the fallen and faded oak leaves of discarding autumn. 
 And scattered over it, in the reckless disorder of nature, resembling abandoned toys of departed children, lie fallen cones of the pines; Goblin carved and polished shapes; symmetrical and always beautiful to me. 
 Many of these have expanded and are already robbed of their buts by the squirrels.  Some are still closed and solid. 
 It is good to be here Where there is stillness Where almost silence is And where there is scent of the pine.
