  
 in good time & Jim took me round to show me all the places of Interest, for this being my Mothers & Fathers native City, there were a few places I was glad to see. 
 I had the experience of going over one of the biggest cotton mills, "The Warwick.", in England & it simply flattened me to see the machinery in that building, & the process the cotton goes through is simply wonderful. The cotton goes in one end from the bales & comes out 6 floors up on reels ready for the shops. Of course there are girls on every floor looking for & mending breaks Etc, but still not doing anything in the way of Spinning. 
 I think I can safely say I was the first Australian to get out to Middleton, a suburb of Manchester, and many were the arguments I heard as to what nationality I was, or from what Dominion I came. Some said I was a Yank, Canadian, or South African, in fact anything but an Ausie.
