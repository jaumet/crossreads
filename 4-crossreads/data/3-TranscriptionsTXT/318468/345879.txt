March 1915.
We arrived at Alexandria at about 7 am.   In the early hours of the morning we had an opportunity of viewing some of the country as we travelled on our way from Cairo to Alexandria.   The fertile flats of the Nile looked well in the early morning light - irrigation canals everywhere & every inch of the land cultivated while at short intervals here and the usual Native mud villages with Date Palms growing about them.   As soon as we arrived at Alexandria to started unloading our gear & we worked all day & far into the night getting it loaded onto the boat.   I was with a party working in the Hold at night packing our carts away & it was 1 am Tuesday morning before we had finished & by that time we were thoroughly done out - having had practically no sleep since the morning before - lots of work & little to eat.   But all was ready for a start!
