  
 Was out this afternoon again with my girl Miss Allan, Biddy I call her she is a case but a real respectable girl of good parents she wants me to go down to tea with her badly but I am fighting shy, but I suppose I will come at it one of these fine evenings, we were up boating on the Worcesters Canal for a few hours then had afternoon tea & home. 
 4th. Was out this morning for one hour for exercise but you might guess how much we done, went down to a little cafe instead & had a cup of coffee & some home made tart. 
 At 10 oclock Rilen & I went into town & on the bus I managed to lose a roll of films I was sorry for they were rather important ones, we got back again at 12.
