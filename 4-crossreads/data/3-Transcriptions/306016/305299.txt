<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father</p>
<p>This is a group taken in Shrewton Village and all the lads shown here were in "Isolation" with me, and belong to our reinforcement, that is excepting the two guards.</p>
<p>From left to right:-</p>
<p>back Row standing:<br/>Corp. Stewart (guard) Ptes. Kelly, Urry (Guard), <u>Piggott</u>, Brimblecombe, <u>Hayes</u>, A. Cryer, Thompson, F. Cryer, O'Connell, L.Cpl. Pepper.</p>
<p>Middle Row Seated<br/>Ptes. Kearins, <u>Walker</u>, McRae, Atkins, Mott, <u>Taylor</u>, Williams.</p>
<p>Front Row, on ground<br/>Ptes. <u>Cavanagh</u>, <u>Lloyd</u>, Williams (Snowy), Walsh.</p>
<p>My favorites are underlined, but most of the boys are nice in their own way, if once properly known.  As the photographer lost the <strike>film</strike> plate, this is the only copy I could get.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,<br/>Duncan</p>
