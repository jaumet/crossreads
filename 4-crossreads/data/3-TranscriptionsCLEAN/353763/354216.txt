  
 Wednesday Sept 30 - 1914 On Monday night an alarm was sounded -  Rockets were sent up & AE2 promptly got ready  -  This was just on midnight  -  The alarm however didn't seem to me to promise very much for I noticed 2 Destroyers at anchor & also that the flagship still remained a darkened ship which it wouldn't have provided the enemy were close up  -  I turned in again & I noticed Stoker soon after come  - back in his bunk on deck  - Tuesday morning I had a jolly swim - my last for a bit for there's going to be movement  -  It's in the air  -  No shore leave granted, coal, water, food taken in  -  This all points the one way - only  - 
 I went off with a patient to the Grantala & returned with him  -  The Grantala crowd have nothing to do  -  3 operations only all their stay & about 3 cases per doctor  -  Pretty rotten going & a dry ship too  -  No liquor bar open  -  They ought to go round to Europe & justify their existence  - 
 The "Oona" came in during the forenoon & the Upolu mails came off  -  We sorted & delivered them  -  I got your three  -  I notice the boy spells "skool" phonetically & quite right too  -  Then we read the papers  -  We are only 10 days out  -  Nothing past Sept 20  -  During the morning AE2 went out & did her diving "stunt"  -  It was quite impossible to see her at times  -  There was nothing to suggest that such a formidable foe was lurking yon  -  Submarines have huge planes - aft - by tilting which at certain angles they go down or come up  -  They fill tanks with water & [indecipherable]  -  Once she went down - bows up - but
