 Saturday 8 June The "Tock Emma" fired to-day, a projectile 150 pounds in weight. From Strazeele heights a great view is to be had of the surrounding country almost back to Estaires.  Quiet to-day with glorious weather. Several fires have been caused by shelling of farm houses. Cook to-day. 
 Sunday 9 June Glorious weather still continues, &amp; we are living very well indeed. The Bosch hit one of our outhouses early this morning.
