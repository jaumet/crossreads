<p>So I'll have to leave it till next time.</p>
<p>I'm feeling very gay today, we've just been relieved &amp; came back for a spell after being 80 days (quite a record for the winter) <strike>without a spell</strike> &amp; I've had a bath &amp; clean change &amp; find myself billeted in an old Chateau, much the worse for wear but with a few sound rooms left &amp; here we have beds to sleep in &amp; a fine fire to sit round &amp; we've had a fine dinner &amp; everything in the garden is lovely &ndash; only one thing lacking to make our happiness complete, the feminine, the sauce that savours our entire existence.  But I wish you could see this spot, "avant la guerre" it must have been indeed beautiful, &amp; though in its ruin its grandens [grandness] still stands out it is of a sort to make one's</p>
