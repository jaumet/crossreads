<p>April Wednesday 11 1917</p>
<p>3rd Field true to their reputation of being great workers have us up at 6.30!   Parade 7 a.m. breakfast &amp; to duties at 8 a.m. our usual breakfast time in our own unit.  Erect more tents during day.<br/>A very heavy snowfall again this evening inches deep.   The past winter has been declared the severest for many years past &amp; even now in April we have had more cold with rain &amp; snow as to make it almost a record.   We should be well seasoned before it is all over.   God forbid that we have to go through another winter campaign, but I hardly think either side is able to stand that much less so Fritz.<br/>14,000 prisoners taken at Arras we're told with much ammunition &amp; guns.</p>
