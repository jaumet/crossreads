<p>truly this is some train.</p>
<p>18th. Left Abbeville at 3 oclock this morning after a weary wait we done this part of our journey in trucks &amp; fairly crowded at that. Arrived at Etaps at 5 o'clock &amp; had to walk 1 &frac12; miles to our camp &amp; we were all very glad when we reached our destination. We were 36 hours doing 90 or 100 miles what do you think of that. I made enquiries here for Len &amp; found that he was down in the Convalescent part of the joint, so after having a wash I went down &amp; hunted him up. I soon found him, he looks alright after his illness</p>
