  
 dear relatives & friends. Crossing the bight known as the Great Bight of Australia every one setteled down. Each one served with a life belt & told off to their respective boats. The trip across to Albany proved to be lovely. fine weather prevailed & arrived in Albany in due time. 
 Fri. Nov. 30 11pm Arrived at Albany & dropped anchor in King George's Sound West Australia. Here we took in coal & sent our mail away. A few of the W.A. troops were allowed away to see their relatives (as regulation prevented this they were sent ashore on mail patrol) 
 Dec.1st Sat 2pm We lifted up anchor & departed from the last port of call in Australia with no escort & bound for Colombo Ceylon. We had fair weather all the way over & had some very gay times.
