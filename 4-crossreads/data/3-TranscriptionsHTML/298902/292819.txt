<p>for the first time so it was seasonable.</p>
<p>Thursday 26th December   Up to breakfast, a lovely meal, few turning up, had a head myself.  Spent the day doing jobs for myself.  Fixed up a proper bed &amp; table, did some washing &amp; wrote several letters at night &amp; hope to start on the equipment job tomorrow.  Weather very mild.</p>
<p>Friday 27th December.  Longing for home today &amp; am beginning to get anxious for the next few weeks to pass.  Made a start on fixing up equipment, C Section first so as to return it to D.A.D.O.S. according to orders, we being 2 sections instead of  3 for the future.  A cold wet day.  Prince of Wales is now visiting the troops &amp; reviews our division tomorrow besides presenting some of the medals owing a long time.  Some more 1915 men due to go tomorrow, those who sailed up to June 1915.</p>
