<p>the avalanche of shells of all calibres which were hurled against them in the 1/7/16, as the world already knows &amp; I will endeavour to give my opinion as to how they were beaten.</p>
<p>During the bombardment all the sides of the trench were blown in leaving just the pieces which contained the dugouts. Our troops were able to storm the breaches &amp; acting quickly with bombs were able to either kill or take prisoners the men underground.</p>
<p>Two out of 3 of them are now filled in &amp; contain the bodies of the dead defenders. One passage I must make reference to was situated on the brow of the hill. This one I went down fully 150 feet and did not reach the bottom. My candle going out &amp; being unable to keep it alight warned me of the presence of foul air so I returned to the top. What was down there is open to conjecture. I finally returned to the camping place impressed with all I had seen.</p>
<p>At 5 pm we moved off for Montaulban which is close to the line &amp; also a place which took many lives to capture. The traffic was terrible &amp; it took us 6 hours to travel 3 miles or more. The country is awful to look at being battered &amp; torn about whilst the mud &amp; water is up to your thighs.</p>
<p>The transport horses were done up when we reached the village &amp; only 3 wagons out of 14 that started reached their destinations.</p>
<p>The first thing that greeted us on arrival</p>
