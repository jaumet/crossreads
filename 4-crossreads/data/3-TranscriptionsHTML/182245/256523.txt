<p>8 MONDAY</p>
<p>Fine, but very cold &amp; it rained a bit</p>
<p>in the evening. We had a full</p>
<p>dress mounted turn out in morning</p>
<p>&amp; marched about three miles out</p>
<p>&amp; back. Generals Monash &amp; Grimwade</p>
<p>inspected us. I was feeling very</p>
<p>crook I had a sleep in the</p>
<p>afternoon. Warren &amp; I came up</p>
<p>as usual to our old billets</p>
<p>for tea.</p>
