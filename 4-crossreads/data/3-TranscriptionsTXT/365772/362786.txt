 good time. Thank Ralph for his kind letter of congratulation to me, I will write him some of these days. Also dear little Beres I treasure all her nice little letters, although I havn't answered one yet. I am glad R is feeling better &amp; wish him the best of luck in his final. Did I tell you I got my second star? I am so careless in these things I forget to tell you lots of things I should. I will see if I can get hold of the "Anzac Book" for you I had one &amp; lost it they should have some in our office here. Thank you very much dear for your forethought in making me winter stuff, I hope I pull through this affair &amp; get back home &amp; repay you for your kindness to me since I have been away your letters are always cheery &amp; newsy &amp; you cannot imagine how I relish
