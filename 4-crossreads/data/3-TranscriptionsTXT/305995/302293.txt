"The troops undertook a task that no other fighting force under the sun would look at & I am the proudest man in the world to be the commander of such a fine body of fighters, which comprise the Anzac Mounted Division.
Well I must now close, for I think every detail possible has been given you & am pleased to say I came through without a scratch. I also hope that I am spared to stay with the old Brigade till this struggle has come to an end, when German militarism shall be crushed for ever.
