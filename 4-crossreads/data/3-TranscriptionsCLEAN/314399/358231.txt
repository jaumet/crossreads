Friday 22 August 1919Went in alongside No 2 wharf at brekker time. Kept waiting till about 11 am before we were allowed ashore. Got a car from the wharf to the P.O. & posted our letters. Bought some post cards & some camera stuff & then had tea. Wrote the post cards there. Went into a jewellers & had a look around & then round to the Grand Hotel for lunch. Couldn't get any there till late so wandered out & went to some cafe. Very poor.  After lunch spoke to a person & he told us to get a car & go to Hout Bay for a spin. We did & it was goodo. Very pretty all the way. Table Mtn. was enveloped in clouds all day. Visited Rhodes house & gee it is bonny. His taste was good. Had dinner at the Mount Nelson hotel & came back about 9.45 pm. The Main was berthed next to us.
Saturday 23 August 1919The Main is a family boat & gee it is some rough. Do hope dear old Nettie doesn't strike one of these things. Quite a lot of birds came onboard today drunk to the world. We left at 11 am & pulled out & awaited our 8 prisoners. They came on about 11.30 & then we steamed out. Our mails left today by the Edinburgh Castle. Took a few snaps. The old boat is rolling some. There is a big land swell. Ate oranges from the Comforts Fund & read some aussie papers after dinner. Had the tables all boarded up at dinner tonight to keep the plates quiet. Saw Sister Gallin & Lt. Anderson on board the Main. Our guards gave a bit of trouble. We are 10 men short.
