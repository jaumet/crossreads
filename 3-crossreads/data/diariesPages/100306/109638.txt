"B" Camp Thoneswood
30/12/16 Stayed abed until late and then got on to a great deal of clerical work. Both Pedler and Slater have reported for duty A cold day. The men resting in their huts surrounded with their Xmas. parcels like children with their toys. Filthy lousy bearded individuals they all are. Baths were to have been available but the boiler blew out and upset all plans. Two men passed on their way back from the front trenches and were just about all out to it with fatigue limping along with bad feet and wearing their full battle order. About 2.30 our heavies plastered some positions and their retaliation led to a few stretchers coming down to our Dr. (Fraser). In U-shaped huts here and very comfortable they are too. Men are rather crowded but appreciate the huts. After being up in the front line system. Big shells have been whistling fairly close to this camp today but fortunately the groups are well scattered and do not offer any very large mark
