<p>Achi Baba, fell almost in 17th B.A.C. 16,000 men landed on the peninsula last week. Had to go again to Y battery wagon line, to give evidence pending a court martial. I brought men to prove he was the wrong man. To make matters worse this man only joined the Battery the day before the asault was commited. He carries two good conduct badges. He was greatly excited. The collecting of evidence was ordered by the Divisional Commander.<br/>Heard this morning that General Ian Hamilton has left here, and Smith Dorrien takes his place.<br/>Another man sent to hospital today suffering from Jaundice, that leaves me with 12 men for 37 horses, and to make matters worse, I had to send three men to 6th battery wagon line to help groom their horses, 90 minutes was the time alloted. The 6th has 6 horses to 1 man. The navy in action put about 60 shots in a nulla on Achi Baba. They are now putting in some H.E. They make a terrific report, you can feel the ground shake. They stopped for a few minutes</p>
