<p>January 1917<br/>the water &amp; all the water pipes are frozen.  The sun has been shining but very feebly &amp; does not make much difference.<br/>27th   The weather is still cold &amp; this ward is far from being <strike>cold</strike> warm.  The roof which is made of iron has been coated with frost on the inside for the last three days.  We heard the news to-day that the 5th Division had had a "hop over" some time yesterday &amp; are holding two lines of trenches, although the 8th Brigade lost heavily.  We have had the taubes over Albert a good deal lately but they have done no damade and on Thursday (26th ) one was brought down about a mile away</p>
