  
 "Wimbledon" Greenknowe Avenue Pott's Point 5 March 1918 The Warden and Registrar University of Sydney Dear Sir, Since I saw you on the subject of my application to be allowed to resume attendance at the University with the status of a student having completed eight courses, I have been discharged from the Australian Imperial Forces as unfit for active service. I shall therefore be in a position to attend lectures from the beginning of the term. I have attended lectures and passed examinations in five courses. I also attended lectures in English I and Latin II, but owing to the pressure of my military duties I was not able to prepare for examinations in these subjects. At the beginning of the war I held a commission in the Commonwealth Military Forces, and during the whole time of my attendance on lectures afterwards I was discharging military duties on home service. IN September 1916 I was accepted for active service. For some months I was employed as Camp Adjutant, and in May 1916 I left Australia as second in command of s Divisional Cyclist Company. On arrival in England I was transferred to the Infantry, was employed for some time on instructional duties at Salisbury Plains, then served as a regimental officer in France, and finally for three months as Aide de Camp to the General Officer commanding the 4th Division. I was wounded twice on the 31st March 1917, on the last occasion to the head.  I am advised by the medical authorities it will be necessary for me to avoid overstrain for some time to come, and I do not think I can safely undertake more than two courses in the present year. If I am allowed to complete my Arts course by taking two law subjects, this will enable me to enter the Law School at once. Yours very truly  K.A.F.
