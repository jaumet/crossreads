<p>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>Your letters were really wonderful this week   &amp;  I'm so pleased to hear that you like school so much. Suppose you will be playing football   &amp;  cricket by the time I Come home. Suppose the boys are all good mates.<br/>You must write   &amp;  tell me all about your School. Must write to Auntie Bell next for her birthday.  Fondest love   &amp;  kisses.<br/>From Auntie Eadle</p>
