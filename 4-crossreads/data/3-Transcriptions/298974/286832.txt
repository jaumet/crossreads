<p>3<br/>inestimable good. But, perhaps, that is a matter which could not be done till I return.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago I had a note from Olly. He was attached to 6th Field Ambulance, but was then recovering from Chicken Pox in Rouen convalescent hospital. What a family! He was very cheery, but was dying for news from home, he had had none for 3 &frac12; months. Getting wind of the whereabouts of the 6th F Amb., I visited it one day, after walking some miles, but found he had not returned from Rouen yet. During the next few days we went into the line. However, I'll keep a lookout for his unit now I know it. I left some of my home letters in the Orderly room for him, they will give him some fairly recent news. I have not seen Tom Bochme for 2 months now, nor have I seen Cairns or Lawrence or Eric in France. We have been near the First Field Ambulance, in fact, their bearers are in the line with us, but Eric is now in the nursing section which stays back in some base town, miles behind the line. Harold too, is usually "in" when we are "out", &amp; vice versa</p>
