And the Staff and his men patients
All off a lurid prayer
That when war is finished and done with
They will meet the Galoot somewhere
And in Confidence strict I tell you
I wouldn't be in his place
When as "Civvies" on equal terms they meet
And stand with him face to face

Sunset
When the Sun goes down in splendour
In the Golden tinted West
And the Shadows onward creeping
Bring a night of peace and rest
Then I think of Life's great Sunset
When all that's dear to me
There will come the evening glory
And I wonder how 'twill be
When the Shadows, onward creeping Shall bring eternity
2
When those fading Sunset glories
Tint with gold each well known place
And the evening shadows, deepening
Shall close in my Day of Grace
Then I'll just look up and trust Him
Who has ever been to me
One deep, sweet, abiding Presence,
