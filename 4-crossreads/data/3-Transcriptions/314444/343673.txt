<p>Dearest M other Father &amp; Dolly</p>
<p>Recieved your very welcome letter dated 4 Oct. today. Glad to hear you are all well. I am getting on a1. Am able to walk a bit with a stick. Father old boy we are a good double now. Mine is on the same side as yours.<br/>Will enjoy the pudding &amp; other luxuries when they come. I can tell you I am looking forward to them. Also the warm clothing as it is going to be very cold here. The water proof will be just the thing, as by what they say we will have plenty of rain. Gee it is cold some days. Hope they chuck it up soon. Surely the German Swine can't hold out much longer.<br/>My letters may not come regular as the water gets so rough they can't get them away till it smoothes down. Some days it blows like the dickens.<br/>We are in our 14th week of the trenches The time slips by, but not quick</p>
