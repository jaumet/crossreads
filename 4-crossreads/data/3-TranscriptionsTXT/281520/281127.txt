Paris5/3/17altar is a carved stone bridge (jube) or altar screen.  The stained glass is very lovely.  There is tomb of St Genevieve surrounded by candles and with a priest seated near it.  Rather much gold paint (reminiscent of mosque tombs)   From here walked down Boulevard St Michel where are some fine shops and bought some articles and then took a taxi back to the hotel.  Had coffee and bread and butter and then to reading room until 7.30 pm had a most animated talk with Mlle. Ella Cumsha late of Bucharest.  [See page 24]
