  
 This evening I saw a letter with Captain Storey, son to David Storey, member of the Legislative Assembly for Randwick, he told me that it had been delivered to him during the evening.  I therefore look forward to tomorrow with the thought that an Australian mail having arrived there may be letters for me.  Oremus! [Let us pray] 
 I have been nearly quite well today. 
 For Friday evening next I am bidden to dine with a doctor Adam Scheuber, a Russian, who practices in Cairo.  He has a chalet close by Mena House, there I visit and talk with him.  He is an interesting personality, midst his books and collection it may be that my evening will be enjoyable, he is a stamp collector, directing his energies in this regard mainly to those issued by the Countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, he has filled nine volumes, which I am to see on Friday.  More anon about him & his place.  It has been told to me that his appetite is large.  If so then he will have a poor competition in me.  Mine is sufficient for my necessities, but it is small when compared with the men who are seated at our table at each meal. 
 His automobile is to be here at 7 p.m., which is to my mind very decent & considerate. 
 5.30 p.m.  No letters have yet come to me, they have been dribbling into the house all the afternoon, my expectations have run high at times. 
 There is so much talk of our moving at an early date, that I have used up all day, endeavouring to complete some articles that have been in the making for a couple of weeks. 
 I posted to you some post cards and views of these parts that you may like. 
 A short letter was run off & posted to Sir J. Carruthers. 
 There is Mother M. Joseph on the sand beyond walking with stately stride, clothed in a cream coloured gown & black robe.  An Egyptian dressed a-la-mode oft reminds one of a member of the Dominican Sisterhood. 
 1-30 a.m., 25-2-15. No letter reached me.  A copy of "Table Talk", a Melbourne publication came, from whom, 
 [Sir Joseph Hector McNeil Carruthers (1856-1932), landowner, federationist and free-trade politician, solicitor and businessman.]
