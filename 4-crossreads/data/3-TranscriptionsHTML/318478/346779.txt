<p>My castle in the air is to get through as much work as possible between August and March next as I intend going to Australia about that time either with or without the family, I hope with.</p>
<p>If we could rent Palmer's place even at a stiff rent it would be worth it and we could maintain perfect upkeep &amp; even improve if he met us fairly.</p>
<p>I don't know what Maurice is like as regards his work or intentions but if I can carry out all my various programmes I shall need an assistant.</p>
<p>This will probably be the last of my long letters &amp; I shall just send you short notes to keep you in touch so that my wire asking you or Maurice or both to meet the Crock will not come as a surprise.</p>
<p>My very best love to (Conky Weedle) Constant.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
