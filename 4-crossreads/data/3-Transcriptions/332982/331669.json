<p>The Saturday before leaving Freetown we had to take 60 sailors on board from the H.M.S.King Alfred.<br/>The sailors were reserves, and were going to England.<br/>We had also to take 450 men (Australian Soldiers) from the Port Lincoln on board, as their ship had run onto a sand bank at the mouth of the Harbour, and had strained her plates in her effort to get off.</p>
