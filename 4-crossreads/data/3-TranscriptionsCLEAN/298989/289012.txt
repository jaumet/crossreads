Bayonet fighting first parade. Purkis a character to look at, has been with the coy. since the start but is a clumsy character who will never be smart. After breakfast went over to 5th Bde HQ. as witness on Court Martial, General Holmes President. Very hot in the sun in the morning. Spent the afternoon at the same place. Our soldiers very smart especially at saluting - quite a change. Aeroplanes starting and alighting very skilful. Roberts left today for 53rd. Roth probably going to Pioneers soon. 5th Bde leave tonight, tip we go on Sunday next.
