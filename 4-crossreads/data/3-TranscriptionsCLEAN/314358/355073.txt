 The various movements I have had recently seem to have put postal arrangements all to blazes for I have found out in one camp that letters came for me and were sent to another camp but on enquiries there I found no one knew anything about them. 
 Now I have written into the base where all letters undelivered are sent so I may yet get them 
 I want them bad enough God knows. 
 From now until further notice address:- Sgt. G.O. Hawkins C/o Major Wall Garrison Quartermaster Zeitoun Egypt 
 Tell our children that when I was at Suez Dog mastiff bounded up to me in the street and went about a bit with me in such a friendly way. 
 After writing that simple story for our children it seemed so natural to see dog mastiff. This is quite true a dear old dog mastiff met me there and seemed to try to thank me for writing about him. 
 I dont know when the third chapter of that tale will be written. 
 Do you know AL-LEIL will be able to write I mean Girlie AL-LEIL means 'The Night'
