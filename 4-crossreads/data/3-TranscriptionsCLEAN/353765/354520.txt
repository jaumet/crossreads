Possibly off "Triumph" A.S.C. fell to & got dixies full etc. Our corps missed it. Somebody shook tin of tobacco from dug-out early yesty evening. Was tin I was keeping for Dave.

Also said that the Turkish positions in front of Quinn's post are to fall within 48 hours!!! & that very good infontn is to be rec'd within 3 days. Speaking to a chap who was
