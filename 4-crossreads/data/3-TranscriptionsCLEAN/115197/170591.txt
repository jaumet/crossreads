 mail.  Leave Waterloo 12.30 - after a pleasant journey and a change at Brochenhurst.  I arrive at "Mentone" Milford-on-Sea at 3.30 a.m.  Milford overlooks the Sea and in the hazy distance lies the Isle of Wight. 
 A jolly walk along the cliffs with Mr Scales, Mrs Matthews, Honor and Joyce.  Much talk and laughter. 
 A game of whist!
