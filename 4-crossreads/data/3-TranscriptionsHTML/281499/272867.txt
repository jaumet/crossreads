<p>keep the water off this book, oh I can tell you I am writing under difficulties.<br/>Last night the 3rd Batt.s band was playing they had a great fire going<br/>Nothing but fatigues this morning, drawing ammunition, steel helmets, gas helmets, rations, &amp; various other things.<br/>I have seen quite a number of the 53rd round here including a few of the old hands who joined it when the Batts were broken up at "Tel-el-Kebir," nearly the whole of the Australian Force is here &amp; there is going to be something doing next time we hop over.  Saw no less than 46 aeroplanes up  Although we are but 5 &frac12;  miles from the firing line, the place at night time looks more like some big town with its thousands of lights &amp; fires, it beats me as how the Germans don't shell the place to pieces for there is nothing to stop them</p>
