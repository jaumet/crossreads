 &nbsp;&nbsp; Then away next morning, and back to France, learning just before leaving the English Coast, that the Messines battle had commenced and that &#39;twas a tremendous success.&nbsp; We were all keen to be in it and felt somewhat chagrined at missing it, but reflected that anyhow, there will be plenty more fighting in the war yet. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I got no further than Divisional Head-quarters and they told me that they had wired to me to stop in London and that I must return forthwith to do a Staff Training Course at Tidworth, England, and so back I went to &quot;Blighty&quot; and am installed here doing preparatory staff work, what it will lead to I don&#39;t know, possibly a job as Assistant Staff Captain, and eventually perhaps Staff Captain, but even if nothing of that sort comes along, I&#39;ll be every bit as efficient, and more so, than a Regimental Officer. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that&#39;s all for the present, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With best wishes from 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.
