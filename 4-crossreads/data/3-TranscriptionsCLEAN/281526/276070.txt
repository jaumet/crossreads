16/1/18 LondonWent out with Dr Craig first to the Bank by tube. Snow was falling, but not lying long on the ground. The press of traffic round here is something enormous. Returned to Leicester Sq where we met Harricks who joined us in a look at Dyson's drawings. Then to Piccadilly meeting McKinnon and Archer en route and then to Regent's Palace to drink coffee and aperitifs and watch the throng of the light and dark of this place. Walked down to Simpsons in the Strand for lunch and dined well there - it is a great place for the Army. Then left Harricks and returned to Victoria to see the Dr. off. Did some writing & left the hotel again about 5 going first to Piccadilly & then walking across to the Strand & up to Fleet St. Dined at the Cock Tavern and then tubed back to Victoria and went to virtuous more or less bed.
