  
 September, 1915 Sunday 19 This is a Teetotal shop & today I sent a nigger to an Hotel (open on Sundays) for a bottle of Johnnie Walker, gave him a small bag to put it in so as O/C would not see it.- My consternation nigger returned still with the bag in  one hand & the bottle in the  other  - Officers take it in turns to provide stimulants - as you know I'm not keen on it; hence the yarn.  Some of these subalterns never had so much money before & they make regular fools of themselves & all not fit to lead horses to water others the best stuff in the world.
