<p>Saturday 6th October 1917</p>
<p>1,000 One thousand miles by rail through ITALY then another 600 through France (about). We expect to be 8 days on the train, so I will not be in England by the 10th. No tucker is available at any town we pass, but fruit &amp; vegetables in plenty can be seen. We travel very slowly only burn Briquettes &amp; little coal but we are going in the right direction. When we pull up at a Town or Station guards are put all around the train <strike>as [indecipherable] riots have occurred at some places.</strike></p>
