<p>We then went across a bridge and walked along the banks of the river to the magnificent Cathedral of world wide reknown the Notre Dame. Inside the Notre Dame seem to me to be very dark, its darkness being lit up by the small lights of  a multitude of candles burning at the various altars. Yet in spite of bareness its vastness filled us with awe. Retracing our steps we walked through a working class district, passed the Hotel de Ville, to the Place de la Republic in which place there is a magnificent statue commemorating the inaugaration of the French Republic. Near this statue is the Hotel Moderne at present occupied by the Army and Navy League for the benefit of the troops visiting, providing accommodation and food. Although this place was very good, still it is not in the class of the Hotel D'Iena in which we stay.</p>
<p>After having dinner we were directed to the Grand Roue and taking the "Tube" we reached that place. The Grand Roue is a huge wheel on which there are carriages, about half the size of a tram car. Paying our fare we had a trip on this great wheel</p>
