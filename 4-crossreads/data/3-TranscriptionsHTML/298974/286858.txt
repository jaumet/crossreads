<p>I am writing this in a small possy dug in the bank of a sunken road. I suppose you will have heard by the time this reaches you that Dene Fry has been killed. He was shot through the head on Easter Monday morning. He was killed where he fell with two others. They were probably caught by a machine gun. Did I tell you that we saw Alan's grave at Warloy village cemetery about two months ago?</p>
<p>We were in the line again for Easter only came out the night before last C. &amp; D Companies had a "hop over" about four o'clock on Easter Sunday morning. Seven men including Dene &amp; myself  [indecipherable]  a  [indecipherable]  fire minutes ahead of D Co.s &amp; advanced until we came in contact with the Huns. Fritz let us get within fifty yds before he opened up on us with rifle &amp; machine gun fire. We had  [indecipherable]  at once &amp; do the snake act back to company &amp; report. It is a miracle that we were not potted then as we were advancing over clear open country</p>
