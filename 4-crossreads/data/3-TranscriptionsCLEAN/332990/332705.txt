 Sunday August 27. 1916 
 A stormy day with frequent showers. The church parade was abondanded owing to the rain.  R.C. and non-Conformists paraded some time previous and were marched into the town but the Church of England service was held in the open. After tea I walked into Romsey with J.W. Dalziel of 39 Battalion & had a few drinks. The hotels are open on Sunday from 6 to 9.
