<p>good grilled steak, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The evening pleasantly and profitably spent at a picture show, the Somme Battlefield, and then home to Lark Hill, falling asleep in the car and waking with a jolt to find that the car had killed a bunny for the driver&#39;s breakfast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This week I&#39;ve been busy, extremely busy on the Lewis Gun, a new machine gun and my latest enthusiasm, in fact my new love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With best love,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours</p>
