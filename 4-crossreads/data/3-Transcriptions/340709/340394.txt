<p>It appears that the capture of the "Gabriel" was a more important event than we imagined. She has for some time been running cargoes for the use of the enemy &amp; has now become a legal prize. Naturally we feel a bit "cocky". Her own officers have been relieved from duty. Lieut Hill (RNR) has been placed in command and I have been promoted to the command of the "Sian". The latter is a steel vessel of 400 tons &amp; is fitted with electric light, electric fans, &amp; cockroaches.<br/>The "Eastern" arrived in port shortly before us. Freidrich Wilhelmshafen consequently looks busy. There are at present in harbour the "Warrego", "Eastern", "Nusa", "Sian" &amp; "Gabriel".<br/>Wed 9th onboard "Sian" : Last night the "Warrego" &amp; "Nusa" quietly slipped to sea and things in port have become rather quiet again. I overhauled the charts today, as, although I do not know how long my present appointment will last, I wish to be prepared for a sudden departure.<br/>Thurs 10th : Another quiet day. No news from the Destroyers.<br/>Fri 11th : "Change and dismay in all around I see!" The expedition's off! It has been found to be a fizzle. In fact, entr'nous, the objective of the fleet was the same as that of the "Lili" on Nov 3rd. The destroyers have again returned to port, thought the "Nusa" is still absent. But the "last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history" is that I am no longer in command of the "Sian", but am again Captain of the "Pinafore". (My mistake, the "Gabriel") The "Sian" is being used by the Royal Navy as a patrol ship.<br/>How are the mighty fallen!<br/>Closing Diary to catch mail.</p>
