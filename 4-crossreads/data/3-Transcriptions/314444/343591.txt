<p>Dear Mr. Garbutt</p>
<p>I have a letter from my boy in answer to mine asking about your son: he says &ndash;<br/>"I am glad you asked me about Joe Garbutt. I was not at the Pitt at the time he was hit, but knew him slightly. He was a fitter and was wounded a couple of days after me at Bullecourt &amp; was in Blighty for some months. He rejoined the battery during the Ypres stunt &amp; a few days after he went up to the guns his dug out was knocked in breaking both his legs badly. He died the next day at the clearing station from his injuries and shock. I have asked one of his friends to write to his father &amp; I expect he will do so, but just in case he should not you might let him know what I have told you. The place which you mention where you say he was buried is in Belgium, somewhere near Poperinge, as the clearing station at which he died was near there. Garbutt was a fine chap much liked by all the boys &amp; the best fitter we have yet had in the battery"</p>
<p>I am very glad I have been able to find out</p>
