<p>Y.M.C.A. letterhead as before.</p>
<p>present, &amp; am thinking of going back to the "Bearers."  I am keeping in splendid health &amp; it is really surprising to note how little sickness there is considering the contrast of climates from Egypt to France.  Formerly we only saw rain once a month, &amp; here we have been mucking round with wet feet for a fortnight at a time.<br/>Haven't heard since your letter of 6th Feby but suppose our mails will turn up in time.  Very strict Censorship here.  Must close,<br/>Love to all at home,<br/>from Leo.</p>
