<p>Hot as Hell.  Marched all night &amp; all day.  Horses tucked up wont drink Brackish water heavy sand, destroyed Wells &amp; burnt some Huts took a few Bedouin prisoners but it is rough on the men &amp; horses.<br/>We take our Wireless Plant with us on Camels &amp; when the little oil engine is started it sounds in the dark just like an aeroplane &amp; the men tumble out &amp; until when very tired [indecipherable] would not leave them.<br/>Total No.6<br/>Bad Writing &amp; Ink has its disadvantages but it makes these notes so hard to read that a Censor soon gets fed up.</p>
