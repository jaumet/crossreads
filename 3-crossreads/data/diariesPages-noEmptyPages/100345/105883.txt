corpse was draped with a union jack the officers men of his Coy on one side of it the firing party buglers on the other side. After the service by the Rev R A Gordon (Chaplain) the firing party fired the salute the buglers played the "last post" making a very impressive ceremony. My arm was still a bit sore during the day my wrist has also been troubling me a lot being very week. Slept on deck. No land or ships sighted : Bible class in afternoon : boat stopped during burial
