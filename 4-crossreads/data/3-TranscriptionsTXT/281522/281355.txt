 18/6/17 Beaulencourt Left at 4 p.m.  and marched to O14C and from there launched an attack on a system of trenches and then bombed along 500 yards. Many faults came to light mostly in bombing. Did some rousing. Concluded the practice in heavy showers and then had tea in Villers au Flos. Our band played a bit for us and then they marched back under the subalterns. With the O.C.s rode over &amp; reconnoitred Haplincourt Wood. My horse bucked a bit but managed to stick on. Had a good run home to camp and mess at 10 pm. Afterwards made a criticism on the afternoon's operations. Not using their blocks is a common fault of the rising generation. Villers au Flos has been a very pretty little village and its chateau is all in ruins. Not a whole house remains standing in the place they have been collapsed by the enemy and the roofs settled down. A cool fragrant evening after the rain.
