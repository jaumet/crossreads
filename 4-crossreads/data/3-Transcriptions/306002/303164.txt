<p>28.5.15<br/>Fri. 28th.  At 12.30 a.m. we were called out of our dug-outs &amp; had to stand to arms in the bottom of the valley as an attack was expected;  nothing happened out of the ordinary &amp; we were dismissed at 4.30 &amp; told to fall in again at 7.30 to go sapping.  The sapping order was cancelled &amp; we slept till dinner-time;  after dinner a party of us went to the beach for a swim &amp; it was lovely.  Snipers have been exceptionally busy to-day &amp; 5 lads were wounded trying to pick up a tin of biscuits, the task was then abandoned &amp; we were told that we would have to wait till dark before we could draw our rations, but the tucker was rescued soon after dinner otherwise we would have done a starve;  bullets have been falling very handy to our "dug-out" all day too.  The beach is well patronised every day with men "off duty" swimming.  I pinched both pockets full of onions at beach to-day &amp; we had steak &amp; onions for tea.</p>
