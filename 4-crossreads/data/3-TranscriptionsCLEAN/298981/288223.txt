 both sides of the canal banks.  In case of an actual crossing by the enemy a vast area of land at certain points is prepared to be inundated by water from the various canals. 
 Warships who have their moorings in the different lakes are dominating all the area likely to be occupied by the enemy in case of an advance.  On land batteries, well hidden in gun pits, are placed at different points of advantage.  When the trenches were not occupied our camps were pitched at railhead, and at the canal banks.  These places were surrounded with canteens, shops, and a Y.M.C.A. 
 The Y.M.C.A. never failed to oblige.  They followed us everywhere in Egypt, in Gallipoli, in France, and in England, providing amusements, canteens, and spiritual exercise.  Wherever we went our boys always looked for the sign of the red triangle which they knew meant a welcome & comfortable home. 
 Ordnance and depot stores with abundance of material, water reservoirs, & troughs for horses are a dominating feature of these camps.  The Light Horse had their camps situated everywhere.  Some at railhead & others  further out near the lines.  The horses   bear   stood the weather admirably & were as assimilated as could be wished. 
 The Light Horse were used as patrols, and they reconnoitred the country far beyond our lines bringing back valuable information night after night, and often capturing or putting to flight  bands scattered  bands of Turks. 
 The organisation is now perfect, and thanks to excellent leadership & perseverance of our officers, all attacks by the Turks have been hopelessly outplanned.
