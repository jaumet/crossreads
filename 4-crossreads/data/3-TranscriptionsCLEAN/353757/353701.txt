This might interest you.  At "Lone Pine", about which you'll no doubt have read, I got a bullet at close range through my hat & had my rifle smashed to old iron & matchwood with a shell.  Everyone who lived through those five days (6-11 Augt.) had narrow escapes and many went out for all time.  We won the position though at what cost you'll see by the lists for 1st Brigade casualties.  Have some good curios, Turkish ring, coins & a medal among them but they're too weighty to send home. 
 What about the Labour Govt. now?  My old man always told me.  "There won't be any money in the country in a year".  Looks good, doesn't it, when 400,000 quid can be collected in N.S.W. alone. 
 Re stadium affair - I wrote Shead & gave him my opinion of those skunks.  I invited him to send my letter to the Bulletin.  If its printed would you cut it out & forward to me as all my platoon asked me to write & I would like to show to them if its printed. 
 Ernie has proved he's as mad as can be.  He signed on as A.B. on the "Aeneas" Troopship & is "somewhere on the sea" at present.  I had a letter from Alexandria in which he told me his boat would probably go to England. 
 Very interested in your paragraph on Royal Commisn. on concentration camp at Holdsworthy.  Just like the treatment a long suffering public would get from a country who acts like they did at the stadium. 
 A quiet word re Roy Smith.  He was wounded alongside me on the night of land (25 April) & went away to hospital.  He was better in a month & has been enjoying himself in Alexandria ever since.  He hasn't done any scrapping & is not likely to.  Anyway, its like his gory hide to write to the paper & make public an accident to myself which I didn't
