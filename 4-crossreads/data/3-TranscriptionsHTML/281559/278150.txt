<p>showers of rain but nothing to growl about : I missed all the fun being on this shift : met Abel Jupp from the 2nd : I have been made a 2/cpl from the 7 Sept but it doesn't benefit me much : a few shells during the week</p>
<p>Sunday Oct 6th Mardyk :</p>
<p>showery &amp; cold : changed onto 6 &ndash; 2 shift</p>
<p>Monday Oct 7th Mardyk</p>
<p>showery &amp; cold : stroll after tea : Frenchies elated over the good war news of late : hope it soon fizzles out altogether &amp; then for Australia &amp; a good time once more.</p>
<p>Tuesday Oct 8th Mardyk</p>
<p>on duty 6 &ndash; 2 : sent Xmas cards to all at home &amp; at Lithgow etc : pictures at night :</p>
<p>Wednesday 9th Thursday 10th Friday 11th &amp; Saturday Oct 12th</p>
<p>duty at the Dunes &amp; as we have gone onto 12 hour shifts again there is nothing doing in the "promenade" line :</p>
<p>Sunday Oct 13th to Sunday Oct 20th : Mardyk</p>
<p>still at the Dunes &amp; owing to the offensives traffic is brisk &amp; we are on 12 hours again so I haven't had time for any outings</p>
<p>Monday Oct 21st Mardyk</p>
<p>still plenty of work : the Allies may well be proud of their</p>
