<p>number of Soldiers on board after a good Run of a few minutes we stopped at a station called Abbede where a lot more soldiers got aboard, after a few minutes delay, we were off again until Caistre was arrived at where more boys joined up &amp; then off again &amp; made one more stop at a Big R.O.D Depot called Borre for a few minutes when more boys joined &amp; then into Hazelbruick arriving there at 8 am. After reporting ourselves at the R.T.O.  Office they told us the leave Train would be in any minute, so we waited for a while when we decided to adjourn to the Y.M.C.A. for a Cup of Tea. Hazelbruick is a fine Station but no conveniences from one Platform to another, Passengers have to cross over the lines. As a Goods Train was blocking the Main Platform, the People had to walk down the line over Rails &amp; stones to cross behind the van, there is no mistake the people are behind the times. After drinking our Tea we waited about for our Train</p>
