<p>Pension Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 30.5.16.<br/>Cairo.<br/>April 18th. 1916.<br/>My very dear Father and Mother,<br/>I cannot find out any mail that is going for more than a week but I like to post every week just in case you know.  On Sunday morning (April 16th.) I was delighted to see an Australian mail and there was yours of 12th March, Mother, and several others from friends, not quite as recent.  Perhaps you didn't write a general letter this time Father, or perhaps you posted it to Rid for a change, and while I was thankful to bits for yours Mother dear you know how greedy one gets &amp; I sighed over the absence of Father's, both then &amp; the next delivery or two.  Still as I said I was happy in getting Mother's and had quite a lot of news in it.  So you actually went to the Conference meetings or rather one, I am so glad, it was quite an unusual way to spend your birthday Mother.  The Home Missionary Meeting always used to be packed and I was wondering until you enlightened me, whether it would be this year with so many of the young men gone.<br/>Since I last wrote I have had no further word from Wal, there has been no opportunity for it is too soon for a letter yet, but I thought I had better mention it.  Nor have I heard from Le, though I cannot expect him to write often like I have the opportunity to do.  Still one can never tell whether they may not have written and there be a big delay on account of censoring &amp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope your parcel gets to him safely, it should just get there in right time.  I made a little parcel for him yesterday morning &amp; posted, &amp; am hopeful for it too.</p>
