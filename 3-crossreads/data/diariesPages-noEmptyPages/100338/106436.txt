June
ordered me to bed for two days.

The Doctor is a very old man, and he can speak very little English, He is also more considerate for the English than other Nationalities. Every now and again when I feel like having a day or two off work, I go to see him. As soon as I am seated in front of him, he asks me my nationality, then my occupation in civillian life, and the place where I was born. He will then say every word he knows of the English language, and wind up with giving me two or three days (No. Vork). He does not even ask what is the matter, A person may be nearly dead, and all the satisfaction he will get is a day or two (no work.) The Frenchmen are not so badly off as the Russians are, The doctor will give a frenchman a day or two off now and again, But the Russians are sent to work every time.

From Sunday the 9th till Sunday 16th of June I was feeling a bit off-color again, so did no work
