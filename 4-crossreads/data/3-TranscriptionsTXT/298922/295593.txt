 Tuesday 9th October 1917 
 Changed  trains  Engines at  MODERN  on the border after passing through MONT CENIS Tunnel. This tunnel takes half an hour to go through, &amp; the scenery is very good. 
 Had breakfast at  MONT MELIAN  with the Alps all around us &ndash; cold but interesting. Changed LIRES into Francs &ndash; fortunately the Railway is the same guage &amp; we have not to change our carriages.
