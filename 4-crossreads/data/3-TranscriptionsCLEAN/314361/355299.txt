Sunday 7thThe sea is now lovely & smooth, & not much rougher than crossing to Manly.This is the fifth day out from Sydney, four of those days we had rather blowy & a little rough.We called in at Melbourne for a few hours only, two or three, & do not think that we will see any more land until we arrive at Suez.Our course appears to be almost due west slightly north.Have got over the Sea sickness, to day have a touch of Rheumatism in the feet, brought on through sitting about on deck in the wind. Went down to tea to night for the first time since we left Melbourne.To day we saw what we took to be a whale, but it was a little too far off to have a good look.Monday Nov. 8th.Best day so far. The Sun is showing better.Wrote letter to Louie & home to day.Wednesday 11th 15Yesterday we called in at Albany to put off some sick. Albany is a very pretty little place situated on the side of two hills. We were only there a few hours, arrived about 6 A-m departed mid day.Took a few photos
