<p>Have directed Beresford withdraw from wireless and move all his force Herbertshohe as garrison. &nbsp;His strength will be four&nbsp;Naval Companies and two Machine Guns. &nbsp;Can &quot;Warrego&quot; take those at present at Kaba Kaul base to Herbertshohe on her way to harbour to relieve Colonel Watson&#39;s Infantry, whom I am re-embarking &quot;Berrima&quot;. Will then move to Rabaul, carry out original plan. &nbsp;Beresford instructed treat with Governor if necessary. &nbsp;Do not require more assistance from you. &nbsp;Will advise Governor as to my commanding on shore. Beresford already instructed remove instruments from wireless, but will definitely ascertain shortest time to reinstate this station.</p>
