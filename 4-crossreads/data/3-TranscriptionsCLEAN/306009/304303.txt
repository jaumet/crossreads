Patients left hospital to be returned to Australia; with them went ex-Capt. Gray, our Quartermaster who has been relieved of his commission in the A.I.F. & is to be tried in Sydney - The 3 men who were sentenced for "pack-store pinching" are also going back by the Suevic. - Sat out in the garden for a few minutes after tea; how quiet & peaceful everything is  - one would hardly realise that there is a great war on.  Received a parcel (the 2nd) to-day from Mother containing a pr. socks, chocolate, 2 books, & a washer.
