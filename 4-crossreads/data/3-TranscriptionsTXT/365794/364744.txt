 Thursday 6 December 1917 Rec'd note from S. Cuthbert, Citadel Hosp. only arrived Monday after 3 months on the trip from Australia.  Left 2 wks before me, arrived Durban safely, lay 5 wks there then across to Bombay in a new boat, then refused landing at B'bay so transferred to another boat &amp; finally landed Port Tewfik &amp; sent P. Said, Alex. &amp; to Nazereah. Citadel impresses me strongly.  Am reading "Curse of the Nile" and one feels a shiver down one's back when driving through those old gloomy buildings.
