Dear old Mater,
A line or two more to say that all's well.  Since last writing we have been on the move again & are now camped right on the sea coast near El Arish.  It is good to be near the water again, & a swim as soon as we got here went very well as we had the dust & grime of a 2 days' ride on us.  Don't think we will be here very long & expect that we will keep pushing on now.
We are at last getting into different country it is getting harder & we notice a little vegetation here & there in the shape of shrubs & a few fig & castor oil trees.  It is nearly 12 months since we rode across the canal & made a start to get across the desert.  Fancy nearly a year to advance a little over 100 miles.  It will give you some idea of the difficulties that were in the way.
Altho' the actual distance is not
