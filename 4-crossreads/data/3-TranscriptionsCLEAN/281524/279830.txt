  
 6/10/17 Ypres & De Kneot Fme Stood to arms at dawn and awaited counter attack which did not arrive. The morning turned out bright and sunny and extraordinarily quiet not a shot or shell being fired. It was the same on our side. More ammunition coming up I suppose. Went round the camp & found them all well but very dirty & tired out. Crowds of parties moving round and a few scattered prisoners coming back. This quietness continued all day. Colonels Murphy & Ralph of 18 & 20th  respectively came round and arranged relief for tonight. Duggan reported his patrols well forward and no opposition but later events did not confirm any ideas of evacuation. About 7 S.O.S signals went up and terrific barrages of m.g. fire & artillery were put down without anything happening. We moved back to Hannebeke Wood. Bogged several times heavy rain conditions miserable especially for the poor men. A couple killed one's head and shoulders blown off cannot identify. Orders now for another attack. I have 200 boys dog tired and miserable. Rest of the day quiet.
