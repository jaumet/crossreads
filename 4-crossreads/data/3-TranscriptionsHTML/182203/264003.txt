Aug. 30th. 1915.<br/>My dearest Belle,<br/>I daresay you &amp; Al. will receive your letters together  I beleive the mail closed earlier than was expected. Well, you must think I'm very lazy writing with pencil but it is much easier than pen &amp; ink. My fountain pen is upstairs in my trunk &amp; my friends forget to bring it to me.<br/>I'm still in bed, much to my disgust but am feeling splendid. The Col. says he wants to be sure, so must just take things quietly and stay in bed. Well, I had a great number of visitors last week. Nearly all the Officers I know came to see me before leaving for the front. I fancy the last of the 6th Brigade left last night. I had four from the 24th in yesterday &ndash; it made me feel quite miserable. They are all as delighted as can be to be off &ndash; Such grand big fellows, with plenty of energy &amp; pluck. Poor old Fred was to go yesterday sometime. He came in Saturday &ndash;</p>
