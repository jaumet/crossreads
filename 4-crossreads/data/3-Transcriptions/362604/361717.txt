<p>&amp; as I eventually found out an A.M.C. man Himself, asked me if I knew a certain chap &amp; it happens that He came away with our Unit.  I do not remember the officer but His name is Gibson &amp; He lived in Lauderdale Avenue &amp; is a Manly Chap.  It is just a wonder to meet these fellows &amp; it makes one remember that He is still a bit of Australian Goods.  Well, Dad, Mum &amp; George, I have not another scrap of news &amp; I want to try &amp; get a few other letters away also.</p>
<p>Kind Regards to all the neighbours, to Elsie &amp; May Miles &amp; the other younger one, Lily &amp; Her Mother, Dobboes, Mrs. Stephen &amp; Bunting.</p>
<p>Love to Bess &amp; Etta<br/>Fond Love to you all,<br/>Harry.</p>
