 Gallipoli Peninsular Feb.  17th  16th 1919 sixteenth  seventeenth (17th)  
 Dear Mick 
 I sent in this mornings letter to Kilid Bahr &amp; hope the best. 
 This afternoon I walked over to Anzac Beach with young Lieut. Balfour, Capt. Bean's offsider, a very nice chap &amp; on the way we came across the remains of what must have been just about the quickest attack on Lone Pine that ever was; [Drawing] at one spot the relics lie close up against Jacko's forward line, but so close together that one cannot understand the onward rush. 
 I did a sketch of the 'Sphinx' from near the landing but a very dull afternoon flattened the interesting modelling clean out and left little else than  I  fine sky line &amp; flat tone against a grey sky. 
 Tomorrow  the 15th  we cover  the  the most interesting ground on block the day after I cut loose &amp; choose my subject [Drawing]
