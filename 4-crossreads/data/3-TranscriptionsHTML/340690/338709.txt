<p>Hosking &amp; another.  On to support line outside Battalion where we waited for Price.  About a dozen 4.2 shells fell quite close and we had to move down trench.  Then up trench and working close by Battalion on deepening dugouts.  Worked until 12.30 and home very quietly.  A lot of new wire out and our path crossed in places.  Bed after supper.  Mail.</p>

Heavy barrage just as we got to Battalion on support line but rest of night very calm.  Same job and some more digging and home at 12.30.  Indignation at Linton and others.  Home to supper &amp; bed.</p>

Had a spell here &amp; then got 4 shovels each and back after one spell overland past Cowshed and Estaminet quietly.  Going got some M.G. very close.
