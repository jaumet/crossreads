<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>Adding to the scribble I made at Headquarters this morning I think I must have got most of your letters if not all.  A steady &amp; most comforting stream and I'm very sorry if my worrying about Maurice should have made you unhappy.  I cut it out as you suggest and get on with my own work which will have to be strenuous to enable me to get all I want in the time.  My first arrangement with Aust. House was to be terminated 17.7.19.  The extension which came through the other day takes me up to on or about the last day in August but I intend pulling out from this country about first week in August so barring delays should see you before the end of August.  For me time gallops at a nerve racking pace &amp; it is only on sleepless nights now thankfully few &amp; far between that I realize I have not seen you for ages.  I get all information about Aust. Artist through Aust. House so don't be tempted to give me any accounts</p>
