My guard went away for instructions returned informed me that my train to Bolougne had Departed that I was to proceed to with a Train of Light Railway Material which suited us better as we would not be on duty as long as if we went to Bolougne after taking water I was shunted on to my Train which was 39 in Length totalled 750 tons. My engine No 1540 was a American Baldwin type with saddle tanks the Westinghouse Brake, although it was a small type of eng it was very strong with 175 lbs pressure to the square inch. We were kept in the yard for a long time eventually left at 10.30 Pm after a hard run as the load was very heavy we arrived at St Omer near midnight, after taking water we were cancelled for proceeding further after a few moments altered again, when my mate decided to clean his Fire, as these type of engines have a dump plate for letting the fire through, he dropped the Plate when he tried to close it again it came uncoupled as there was no pit handy I decided to go into the Depot connect the gear up again. The Station Staff decided to put a Calais Engine on the Train ordered
