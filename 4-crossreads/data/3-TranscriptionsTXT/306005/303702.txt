 16-1-17 Tue 16th A Taube came over early this morning &amp; tried to drop 3 bombs on our hangars but missed badly, one of our 'planes chased her off; at 8 oclock this morning 11 of our planes flew over loaded with bombs &amp; they came back independantly during the day at intervals, it is a treat to watch them descending in small circles &amp; head first; Several Tommies in swimming this morning were carried out by the undertow &amp; drowned the surf is very treacherous &amp; one  dip is generally enough to satisfy poor swimmers to have a fresh water wash instead of the surf. A mine was discovered this morning &amp; fired off about a mile from the beach floating in the sea.
