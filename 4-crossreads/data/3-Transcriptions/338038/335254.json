<p>You will be tired of listening to this everlasting war chatter, but as I said before our world is very limited here.</p>
<p>I hope to be able to tell you in my next of my first impressions of the "air". I am going up in an observation baloon to have a look at the country &ndash; directly we get a fine day. The weather has been rather inclement for the sport of late. Many of our chaps have been up for a spin in a plane but I have not achieved it yet, as it is rather difficult to get away.</p>
<p>I hope your old enemy rheumatism has been absent during this winter. You did not mention it in your last, so I trust you have weathered round the cold months without an attack.</p>
<p>No more news just now, so will close, with love from</p>
<p>Your affectionate Son  Terence W.Garling</p>
