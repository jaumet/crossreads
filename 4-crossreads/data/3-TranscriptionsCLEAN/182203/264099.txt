  
 & comfy chairs & good lights, I simply long to be home again. Though I'm glad I was able to come out & try to do my little bit. Than goodness I'm a nurse. All the comforts & pleasures of home life I shall appreciate when I return. Time to stop & am very tired, writing by candle light is very inconvenient. Hope you are all very well & happy. To-morrow will be a sad day to us, poor old Dad, what a blessing he did not live to see this war. Fondest love & kisses to you all. From,                                                                                                                                          Your loving daughter,                                                                                                                        Edith.        Have not received any letters yet. Am longing for some. Not a line from any of the boys. Hope they are safe & well.
