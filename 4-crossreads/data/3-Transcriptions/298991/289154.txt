<p>Monday April 2nd<br/>Snowed pretty heavy this afternoon. Went to the dentist to have four of my teeth attended to, but owing to pressure of work I have to go again tomorrow. All the fellows picked to go out into the field were medically examined, &amp; are all very busy packing up. Four other men who have got transfers into the field are also busy &amp; excited. Australian mail in today. I will have to wait for my letters to come from the 4th Field Ambulance. Got the afternoon off, &amp; went down to Wimereaux, was back by seven.</p>
<p>Tuesday April 3rd<br/>There seems to be some mystification regarding the new draft of men going away. Nobody seems to know anything about them, even when they are to go. All have packed up in the meantime. Very windy &amp; cold this morning. Myword it is cold getting up at 6 am. Dr Bush examined me this morning &amp; referred me to Major Finn (eye, throat &amp; ear specialist). I have tonsalitis. My left tonsal <strike>requires</strike> is to be taken out.</p>
<p>Wednesday April 4th<br/>There were a good few Australian wounded come in this morning. They have had a pretty bad turn in, according to what they say. Feeling very much off colour today. Major Finn examined me, &amp; referred me to Captain McClure. Put in 2 ward this afternoon, &amp; was booked up to undergo an operation for tonsalitis in England, quite unexpected but very acceptable. Got all my belongings etc together this evening. Said goodbye to the boys &amp; sisters I had made the acquaintance of.</p>
