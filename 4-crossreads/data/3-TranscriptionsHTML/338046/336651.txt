<p>The coal dust as soon as it struck the heat in the furnace burst immediately into flame. The revolving of the cylinder caused the pebbles to roll towards the lower end where they dropped into another large cylinder below. The attendant used to glance occasionally through a blue glass to see that all was going well in the cylinder. The lower cylinder also revolved, the cooling pebbles dropping into a truck awaiting them. when full this truck was pushed to the crushers in another building. Buckets raised the material to another crusher similar to that which crushed the coal, being a revolving cylinder containing large iron balls and spikes &ndash; (a ball mill). This ground the stones to a fine dust, which was elevated to the storing building. The bagging was done by hand, the bags closed, sealed, taken by truck to a lift and lifted to the railway line where they were shipped off.<br/>The finished cement was ground so fine that it would not support the slightest weight. I put my foot an a heap and it went straight through as though the cement had not been there. a chap</p>
