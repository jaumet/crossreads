<p>2   letters from Mrs Clarke since,   <strike>I w</strike>   &amp;   have answered them.  Marion sent me some Parcel too.  I do not worry about what Mr Clarke said now.  But I do know that we have done quite a lot of good work since we took over this business.  We do no dressings now which is a great Treat.  I have finished Night Duty now   &amp;   it is just heaven to be on Day Duty again.  I had several dressings to do then but one of the Orderlies volunteered to do the only nasty job that came my way.  One of Sergeants got knocked down by a Motor   &amp;   smashed up a bit.  It was a nasty job to wash Him as he was covered with Blood from head to foot.  They all thought I was not game to do the job   &amp;   I let them think it.  You know I always kidded I could not light fires because I did not like the job.  I was waiting for a man to die for a fortnight too, but luckily He died at 5.45pm, &frac14; of an Hour before I came on Duty,   &amp;   I was spared the job of laying the poor fellow out.  I go out for a walk on every opportunity.  Dave   &amp;   I walked to Amesbury again yesterday.  We had 2 or 3 Hours in the Village   &amp;   then returned Home.  There is nothing to see, only a few soldiers   &amp;   about one or two civi's   &amp;   Girls.  We go to the Theatre now   &amp;   again,   &amp;   sometimes the Pictures, so we do have a little to relieve the monotony.  I write a fair number of letters   &amp;   at present I am getting in as much sleep as I can.  I slept the round of the clock   &amp;   2 Hours over last night.  I averaged 2 &frac12;  hours sleep daily for the month I was on Night Duty,   &amp;   only two meals a day   &amp;   lots of times only 1 meal.  I have often gone 20</p>
