a large number of the original unit had been transferred to Field Amb, etc. Our leave being almost ended we left Cairo Station at six fifteen this evening.

The scene as we travelled through this eastern country in cool, calm evening is one that I am not likely to forget. The balmy air, the descending sun, and the outline of the palm trees, the camels with their riders perched on their backs, the donkeys with their masters who were dressed in light flowing robes was fascinating indeed I had a feeling of sadness, at the thought that I was leaving it all probably never to see it again, the "Fascinating East."

We reached Ismaelia about midnight and following the track of the railway we made our way over the desert to the Canal. A pretty stiff walk it was especially at those parts where we left the railway and walked across the sand.

When we got to the canal we found the bridge closed. Luckily a boat was crossing from our side and we got in to it.

As we got midway on the canal a couple of natives rowing a boat as if they were trying a race almost collided with ours. The language of the men in our boat was anything but complimentary and oath after oath was showered upon the heads of these natives as they rapidly made their escape. I thought when I saw the boat coming towards us that it was all up with us.

We reached camp at midnight very tired but highly pleased with our trip to Cairo.
