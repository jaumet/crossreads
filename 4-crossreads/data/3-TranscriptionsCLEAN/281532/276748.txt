  
 25/10/ Yzeux 
 at what had passed. That is how we run the Army! Through Belloy over to St. Vast and saw Beith and the 23rd. A fine stubble field here for parading. Down in a hollow is a bayonet course and room for L.G. and miniature ranges. We then returned to Yzeux. After lunch I went for a walk and did a ramble through pretty woods full of falling leaves and fast assuming winter looks. Inclined to rain. After dinner met Muirhead and others from 6 Field Ambulance and went into Belloy to see a full dress rehearsal of the Dinkum Diamonds the Divisional Concert Party. It was not a bad show but there was a good deal of stiffness to start off with as some of the performers were nervous. The doctors are rather worried about the epidemic of influenza and are "windy" about it.
