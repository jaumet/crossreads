 Nice day - but very cold also at night - went to Mass at 10.30 - by Father Gilbert. All confined to billet area - as I expected after last night - I managed to sneak out along the river as I have marked on a post card - Struck a lot of 59th Boys in an a Estaminet - also some French fellows who could play & sing - had a good old sing song - Got a snap taken of myself all dirty - etc just as I came from Rifle Villa yesterday - they are breakups - owing to the Division moving all mail is hung up - just managed to get some of the snaps thro to Frank.

 Very cold day - Our Section on Fatigues & still confined to Billet area. Had read out on parade about voting on conscription - Amused ourselves most of the day by stump electioneering speeches for & against, very funny. Most of the boys got out after tea & got merry & it is only a rumour things were not gay till the small hours - all determined to have a bit of fun if going to be confined.
