<p>February 1915<br/>Monday 15<br/>About 4 AM this morning we attacked a position near the Sakara<br/>Pyramids. I was so tired after the march that I could have fallen asleep on the march.. But I thought the ground was not level enough to walk over with rifle ammunition &amp; equipment. We had breakfast at 8.30 AM had a good spell &amp; then proceeded to carry another attack scheme. My Coy. (C) was fortunate enough to be the support of our Batt. Our capt expressed pleasure at the way in which our Coy worked. Of course we won the battle. we always did. Got back to camp about 1.30 P.M. Bread and butter &amp; tin meat issued We sent the meat because there was only one small tin to be divided between about 40 men.</p>
<p>Tuesday 16<br/>Orders to be ready to move off the bivouac ground at 8.30 A.M. Stew for breakfast. The whole brigade formed up to hear the Brigadier's comments on the work done &amp; that he would tell the G.O.C. that we were fit for war. He was sorry however that we could not leave yet as a case of smallpox in the Bgde. had resulted in a death. Small pox in Egypt is very severe. Marched home &amp; were very pleased to be able to get a good wash &amp; buy a luxury or two at the Canteen. [indecipherable] canteen has been kicked out. He was robbing the men. Got vaccinated</p>
