16/3/18 Red Lodge
to realise that we were so close to bloody war. In the afternoon had a good hot bath at the Brigade baths and then tried a number of Orderly Room cases ? mostly overstaying English leave. This offence has been very prevalent of late mainly because the authorities in England have been tightening up the supervision there. After dinner the moon came out and there was a grand starlit night. Aeroplanes buzzing above. A few very big shells burst fairly close but they did no damage. Nine platoons have gone forward tonight on working parties up around the front line. The "three Diggers" ? Sutherland, Howell and Barker are reunited today but the return of two of them from leave. They are fine upright and manly boys these
