country, I may be sent off to Harefield Park up near London. I hope I see some of the country here first, some of our chaps should have gone to H.P. this week but there were no beds vacant so they are still here, I also heard that some of our men are being sent home. I fancy some are going to take on Home Service Should not be a bit surprised to hear that men in Home Service Battns. who are fit for service, are being sent out, and men who have been wounded, put in their places. Weather conditions here at present not over pleasant, plenty of rain, and cloudy oppressive weather. One thing Since I cam here I have been able to do a little reading. One of the nurses got me some good books and Mrs. Hall sent some. Nurse is going home on Tuesday and is bringing me a couple of books, She's a jolly girl from the country. She was making one of the beds on Thursday. The occupant had some Preserved Ginger that a visitor had brought in, so I purloined the bag and gave Nurse some. She told me that she was so fond of preserved Ginger that at home her people called her Ginger = I had her Auto book so thinking that Ginger and Gee went well together "that is her name".
