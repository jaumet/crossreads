 12-3-16 Sun 12th Our tents were brough from Minia station this morning &amp; erected this afternoon; Reid &amp; I have a tent to ourselves with the telephone by the tent pole, we are having a particularly easy time as we can move about anywhere within hearing of the telephone bell &amp; come back to it when it rings, we go to bed anytime we wish &amp; trust to the phone waking us; 
 Today has been lovely neither too hot or too cold, &amp; the spot we camped on would be considered a perfect place for a picnic at home &amp; it is a holiday in reality for me, One troop has to go out every night on patrol. Also a troop during the day so with the guards &amp; horse piquets fatigue &amp; patrols , the ordinary troopers have a fair amount of work to do
