Sympathy don't exist in the navy - I've notified Johnson that he'll be buried at sea - no landing party & a walk to a cemetery for him - just lead & the deep sea -I'll tell a short tale - A very notable person died & a party of bluejackets were offered 5/ each to walk with bowed heads & bent backs - slowly pacing behind the coffin - off the cortege went - Heads down - Backs curved - on & on - & on - "Blime me don't it smell" said one Bluejacket - "Keep yer blanky 'ead down or they'll cut 'arf a crown off" said the Petty officer - On they went for another mile only to find - that - at a cross road - they'd lost the original mourning party & with bowed heads & slow steps they had been following a manure cart going back to a farm - This is a good tale but the wily bluejacket probably got to a Pub - not to a farm -
