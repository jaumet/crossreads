<p>Mick has not altered a great deal, only a little thinner I think. Am going to bed early tonight I feel very tired &amp; my arm is getting very painful &amp; sore, result of innoculation (a double dose) however it means 48 hours exemption so that's not so bad. This morning all the Battalions were "fell in" after church parade &amp; marched away to be addressed by a mob of wowseristic "Salvationsists", they tried to get me to go but not one of the Sergts went all mysteriously disappeared when they heard what it was, &amp; scores of the men followed suit when no one was looking, I reckon they have the father of a hide to expect the lads to come</p>
