THE Somme
 (Lealvillers)
25/7/16
 A grey day with wreaths of smoke forming a haze, due to the heavy gun fire in front. Perhaps the cloudy weather can be traced to the same course cause. In morning parade we marched out and did an open attack and in the afternoon routemarched round the Harponville square back to here. Dropped out at Varennes. It was a most unpleasant march owing to the heat and all finished up dust begrimed and tired. At Varennes a big concourse of officers including 2 Generals, assembled to witness ?a bomb demonstration? by Stokes guns. They created hell with their devasting expolosions. The little bit of countryside selected was ripped and torn to pieces as shells plunged in thick and burst with streaming flame and acrid smoke. Some fine old fruit trees were stripped of their leaves and the selected area was laid waste.

 At 3 a.m. an orderly walked in with march orders and at 4 a.m. we marched out in column of route. Rather quick work. No breakfaSt. Marched 8 miles on empty stomachs and reached Albert at 8 a.m. The town lies in a hollow and is dominated by its shell wrecked church atop of which is the Falling Virgin ? a big brass statue on top of the spire which has been knocked right over by German shells but still has not fallen. What holds it I don't know but the statue is balanced at this angle on top of the spire. Local legend has it that when the statue falls the German Empire will fall also. Some shelling and a couple burst near us. We are under orders to advance tonight and shall return either crowned with laurel or wreathed with cypress.
