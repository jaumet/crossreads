<p>toast himself on our cabin heater, (steam) there being none on the Geelong. Being the last day perhaps we decided to fix him up. He was a real "old woman", always poking his tongue out "looking for strawberries" &amp; taking medicine for imaginary ills. However our chance came that morning. After talking about the wireless set for a while &amp; asking questions, he went out to buy a paper &ndash; evidently to read whilst sitting on the steam heater. We'll fix him said Teddy as he ran two leads from the emergency coil to the door handle, shutting it at the same time. The spark gap was closed right down so as to give him a good one without fear of injury, and on testing it there was quite a shower of sparks. When the electrodes of this coil are opened 10 inches &amp; the key pressed, there is a sharp "burr" &amp; a spark like a small stroke of lightning. Great care is needed when handling this coil as it "stings" badly. Teddy sat at the instruments with his hand on the key &amp; I walked to the porthole. In a few minutes he came along the dock rubbing his hands &amp; getting ready for "a warm".</p>
