<p>1915 Monday December 13<br/>One man got a scratch last night but we got up about 150 yards of Barb wire &ndash; At some points the Turks have thrown out grappling irons &amp; dragged the Barb wire in, at one post they sent back a message rolled around a stone that "15ft lengths would be easier to handle"<br/>Some humourists evidently &ndash; I could tell you much to interest you tonight but I dare not &ndash; However its a 1000 to 1 we will not spend our Xmas Dinner on the Peninsular. No more Mails outwards or inwards for the present.</p>
