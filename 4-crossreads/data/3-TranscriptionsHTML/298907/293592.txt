<p>bravo Australia, Australia bon, &amp; some of the old people actually cried with joy &amp; relief when they saw the lads coming up with that firm easy swinging stride which belongs to us alone when marching in coloumns, here they thought were troops who would give Fritz a fight for it, come what may, I don't suppose you will believe me but what I say is quite true, we have a reputation second to none, &amp; I don't think we are going to lose it either, just before we reached Borre, we were halted for breakfast &amp; rations were issued so we sat down &amp; had a good tuck in for all were very hungry &amp; tired after the long &amp; tiresome train journey right from Amens while we were breakfasting numbers of Tommies kept on trickling down all dead-</p>
