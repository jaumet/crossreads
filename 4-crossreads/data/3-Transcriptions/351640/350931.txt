<p>shall keep tapping away here till he returns, the train is due about 11.15 and the distance is but fifteen minutes drive in the motor.  Thereafter I hope to get through a letter to Mollie, and perhaps some others.  The Catholic Press, The Advocate, from your end and the Daily Telegraph from Hyman arrived this afternoon, they have not yet been opened.  Mrs Reynolds is responsible for the first, Mrs Knowles for the second, and the little Jew for the third.   Good of them.</p>
<p>What is rain like?   What a sensation would there be in this region if there were to come a heavy thunderstorm?  The houses and all other structures would be battered to pieces in very brief space.  All construction is of very poor workmanship, and appearances do not belie the material and the manner of work man who built.   Good night.
