<p>This afternoon while I was waiting for the carts to come down to the dump I went into a big woollen mill there are nearly all young girls and women who are working in it. I noticed most of the machinery was made in Alsace, nearly all the wool from what I could see of it was very fine and carded.<br/>Pay day again and some of the boys are broke already, gambling as usual. Was down at the railway station early this morning there were hundreds of Germans unloading trucks.<br/>3rd  Church parade this morning and the first one we have been on for a long time the 3rd Batt had their band out and it was very poor especially the cornets.<br/>We all got our 2nd blanket again last and by heavens it was wanted for you can't sleep with one blanket</p>
