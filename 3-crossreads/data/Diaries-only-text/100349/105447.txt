chief I suppose. Last night, with some of the chaps, went to a village some distance away across the Somme River. Saw some American regular troops there, rough chaps whose blustering manner annoyed us. They "guessed" this was their town and they didn't want any Australians in it. There were about 8 of them in a Caf where I was all wearing heavy automatic pistols. In the physical argument that followed I was flung outside but returning to the attack, we succeeded in driving whole lot of them out of the town. If these fellows fight anything like the way they "RoughHouse" they will do. They will be decent chaps too when they learn that their name is "Mud" here. Managed to get back to camp in the "wee small hours." A grand day.
