 Dear Mr. FitzGerald 
 I enclose a copy of a letter my son wrote from Damascus. He was lieutenant in the 9th Light horse - raised in this state. He had a great experience - first on Gallipoli, from about 6th May to 24th October 1915 - Rejoined his regiment on 7th Jan 1916. after being invalided at Malta and was in every fight of the Palestine Campaign except those fought when he was away from his regiment for two months at an officers school. After taking Damascus - The Brigade 3rd was camped on a Creek a few miles South of that city with 4000 Turks about a mile above them - dying from all sorts of diseases. The whole Brigade were ill - they lost their Field Ambulance - & men laid on the ground for 5 days before the ambulances came up. The hospitals at Damascus were crowded out - Fortunately the Turks were not able to seize the opportunity.
