<p>19.5.15<br/>Wed. 19th.  At 4 oclock this morning the Turks charged our trenches.  The attack was expected &amp; only one Turk reached our trench &amp; was bayoneted.  This morning dead Turks are to be seen lying in every conceivable position.  Their losses were enormous.  Chambers, Moffat, Whittle, Aldridge, McArthur, Fisher, &amp; Hunt were killed in C Sq.  Lieut. Nickoll was seriously wounded &amp; will lose an arm if he lives.  Cpl. Milligan Pett (N-mine) [Narromine?] was wounded in the mouth, I believe he has half his tongue shot away.  Todhunter "B Troop", Selff &amp; a few others were wounded, but only slightly.  The fighting was terrific for an hour, soon after 5 o'clock the Turkish Artillery got busy &amp; gave us a very interesting time;  apparently they are not short of ammunition this morning, but the New Zealand trenches on the opposite hill to us seems to occupy their attention mostly.  C Sq. bore the brunt of last nights</p>
