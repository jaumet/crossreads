<p>Bailey rendered "Somewhere a voice is calling." and "A Perfect Day" with genuine feeling. Also D. ran through the whole gamut of rag-time commencing with "Robert E. Lee". Roll Call 9 p.m.---just too late. However, Glover accepted a nil report.</p>

They gave me bread next door. We could get no coffee, so beer and champagne formed our beverage.</p>

<p>Saturday, 22.<br/>Usual routine.</p>
