<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I only wrote to you about four days ago but since then more mail has come and I got two more letters from you - so I think I will start another letter in reply to them. My old pen has started to fount again. I thought it had out lived its usefullness but a couple of months spell in my haversack and a piece of cotton shoved under the feeder and its as good as gold again. I am posting you to day that paper I told you about the Kai-ora Cooee. its not too bad. I think the article on the return of the 1st Divn is splendid. We have some old chaps here now who are exactly like the returned man in it. The wrapper round the paper is stuck together with scraping out of our porrige pot, and it seems to hold well. Guess that would make another paragraph for my Mrs Lance Rawson book! Your letters were dated 5th &amp; 17th Feb - the latter from down in Sydney. Was sorry to hear Aunt Katie <s>had been ill. I had a letter from her from Lawson in</s></p>
