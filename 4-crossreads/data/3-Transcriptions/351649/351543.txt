<p>Dear Mrs. John</p>
<p>How are you all at Toganmain &ndash; if you are only as well as I feel, no one could wish for better.  You see I thought for so long that this season in Riverina was another 'dud' (<u>very</u> technical term for a shell that doesn't bust) that it was slowly weighing my mind down.  All of a sudden, along comes a cable saying good rains June &amp; July.  Now the weight suddenly off my mind lets it rise up to great heights, which my body couldn't keep up with &ndash; so I found it necessary to elevate the body also, the very special occasion warranting such:  this was easily done by means of 'Dewars White Label' (ever heard of it), so here we are, under the ground, three in number, viz, a Rhodesian, a Patagonian, &amp; me in the best of health and spirits in spite of our dismal surroundings.  So there, Mrs. Robertson!!!</p>
<p>I got two more letters from you numbered 5 &amp; 6, which means No. 4 has not yet arrived, but sometimes our mail follows us for weeks &ndash; for we move about a little.  Now at the beginning of July we came out of action and went back to join the cavalry and after three different marches we finally arrived back here in humdrum line action after 25 miles one night.  But it was not so disappointing as you'd expect (seeing we were hoping to dash through a gap in the Huns' line) for we didn't altogether expect them to retire except gradually, and I'm just sure their time will come this summer for there's a terrible squeeze going on for Germany all along her lines.</p>
<p>Three nights ago I put a gun from my section up within 750 yds of the German lines and drove it there with horses too &ndash; it took several</p>
