 All his gear and belongings has been packed up &amp;  sent away through the DAG 5 Section From there it will be forwarded on to you. I wanted to hold it &amp;  send it across to some agent but unfortunately there was no choice He was buried in the British Cemetery at Bois Grenier. If you write to the Graves Registration Commission they will be able to give you any further information you may require. 
 I am awfully sorry that I have not written sooner. But there has been much to do lately. The Staff Captain went sick to hospital on the 14th &amp; I had to take over with no notice at all. Soon after he came back a few days ago I was sent for by division to be attached to G.Staff &amp;  we have been on the move for 3 days. I shall try to get in touch with Keith in England. The 3rd Division are partially there now. 
 With kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson  [indecipherable] others you 
 Yours very sincerely
