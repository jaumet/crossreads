 Dear Mrs. John, 
 Just a few short sharp lines more to thank you for your two letters & the photos than anything else.  You are a brick to write so often & just the things I wish to know of. 
 As for the photos, they are both splendid especially the one taken with Graham, thats the best one of you I've ever seen I think.  I have it stuck right above me & you would smile to hear some of the remarks.  Don't be alarmed, always complementary,  most  & sometimes quaint as well. 
 I took it to show Mrs. Johnston & she
