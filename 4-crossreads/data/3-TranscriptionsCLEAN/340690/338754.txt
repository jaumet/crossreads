  
 The Fisher's Wooing 
 I Give me a  plaice  in your  sole , love, In spite of my  'erring  ways, I'm weary of  whiting  for  your  thee, love, Lonely & sad are my  dace . 
 II Life has its catches of  ills , love, So  carp  not but heed my call: 'Twould be a sad  bloa-ter  me, love, To lose you, my  haul  in  haul . 
 III The  net  result up to now, love, Has left me  crab  -by and sore; With a kerchief I  dab  my eyes, love,  Oy-ster , full of vim, no more. 
 IV Give me a  plaice  in your  sole , love, We'll pair like the finest  Dover , And ever - no  cod ! - I'll remain, love, Your own loving  Salm-on  clover!
