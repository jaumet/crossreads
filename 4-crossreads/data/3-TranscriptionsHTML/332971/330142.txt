<p>Tuesday June 1st<br/>Fancy the first of June and red hot. With the expectation of reaching Colombo in the small hours of the morning everyone seems more cheerful than usual &amp; making plans for how they are going to spend the day. We are not allowed off without an Escort. So our party consists of Mr Powell, 3 of his friends &amp; 5 Sisters &ndash; so aren't we looking forward to an outing.<br/>Thursday June 3rd.<br/>The day has come and gone but the memory of it will be treasured as one of the most interesting and delightful of days.<br/>The first thing I was conscious of was my cabin mate calling down at 4 am. "Sister wake up I can see lights upon lights". Then followed immediately the search lights on us, with the native boys calling out Money Money Money mixed with a lot of jabber of their own. There was no more sleep. All the natives seemed very excited over something &amp; we soon learned what it was &ndash; Riots in the town between the Mohommadons and Buddists over religion - over 300 had been killed &amp; many wounded. We were told it was unsafe to go out of the Town &amp; soon had orders</p>
