 Tuesday 7 [6] August 1917 [1918] Cairo 4 p.m. &amp; took McDonald to 5 p.m. tea, or ice. Dissatisfaction in Off. ward.  Sister Rail making herself very cheap with R.A.M.C. pt. Davies, all pts. remarking upon it.  Orderlies grumbling &amp; yet she is Miss Gemmell's pet &amp; reported spy.  Miss Wylie reported, S. Kennedy for (?) rudeness &amp; sitting on pts. beds.  She also is up for honors, it is believed. The whole tone of the hosp. is unsatisfactory at present.  Food is less bad since I reported it to Maj. Leach but quarrels or fault finding occur daily.  Miss Gemmell being particularly hard on some sisters, S. I. Moors usually.
