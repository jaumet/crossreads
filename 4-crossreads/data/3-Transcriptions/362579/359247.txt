<p>My dear Mother   &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>Received Belle's letter dated Nov 6th yesterday, which I was delighted to get.</p>
<p>Last night I got a letter from Fred   &amp;  he had not received one from me for months, so you see the letters go astray because I have written very often. He got the P.C. I sent so wrote straight away. He is well also all the boys. I'm interested in, that belong to his Reg.</p>
<p>Had a nice little letter from Norman   &amp;  he too had not heard from me, nor received some cigs I had sent.</p>
<p>He was at Convalescent Camp Rouen when writing but was leaving for Etaples &ndash; so shall write to him there. Have not heard</p>
