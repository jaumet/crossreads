<p>fleecy clouds &ndash; the scream of the shrapnel, the Hell noise of the firing, giving place to an unbroken stillness save for the chirping o f a bird or the soft buzzing of the bee! I wonder would it be thus!</p>
<p>A rather amusing experience happened to me &ndash; there is one particular open space so well set by snipers that few men have been able to get across it &ndash; a stream of dead marks its length, it is called "Dead Man's Patch" &ndash; I had to cross this space many times; it would have taken too  long to go a more circuitous route for all messages were very urgent &ndash; upon this occasion, I crept into the bushes which fringed this bare patch and took my breath ready for my dash across &ndash; I lunged forward &ndash; the seat of my pants caught in the bushes, and I hung by them! I was in a terrible funk, for then the snipers got busy &ndash; I felt as if I had been hanging there ages, though I don't suppose it was very long &ndash; at last I tore myself off.<br/>When I got the other side of the Patch, my now unseemly garb sent the lads into roars of laugher &ndash; certainly it was more hygienic than comfortable, and it was some days before I had a chance to dock for repairs.</p>
<p>APR; 29<br/>After four days and four nights without a rest, at last I am relieved and go back to the rear for a few hour's rest.<br/>All the way along there is always that stream of wounded coming</p>
