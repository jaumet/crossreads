 March 28th Reticence seems to prevail concerning the happenings at Gaza. We have not heard any more of the big guns.  There are two main rumours about it out &ndash; that we took Gaza &amp; 500 prisoners but the arrival of a three mile long column of Turkish reinforcements made us retire onto a previously prepared position, where we are waiting for the Turks to bring all their available reinforcements &amp; then we are going to attack in force &amp; smash the lot up thus making a decisive affair of it.  Also they say that the turks have 9" guns &amp; that our artillery is absolutely out ranged. There are three facts which I have seen with my own eyes.  1.  A one gun monitor went up past El Arish this morning. 2.  Two hospital trains have come back so far. 3.  Eight "Tanks" went up on the train this morning.
