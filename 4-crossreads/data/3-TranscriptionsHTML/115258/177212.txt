<p>1st April, 1919</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I am in receipt of advice to the effect that No. 2480 private R.C. Wilson, 1st Light Horse Regiment, is returning to Australia per transport &quot;ULINAROA&quot; which left Egypt on 13th March, 1919 and will probably arrive in Melbourne about the 14th April, 1919. Further information as to the exact date of arrival and time of disembarkation will be published in the press when available. It should be noted, however, that owing to possible mutilations in the cabled advice, and other causes, this notification may not be correct pending verification from the roll after the arrival of the troopship. Any further inquiries should be made to the Staff Officer Returned Soldiers, Military Head-quarters, Paddington...N.S.W.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>J M Lean Major,</p>
<p>Officer in Charge, Base Records</p>
