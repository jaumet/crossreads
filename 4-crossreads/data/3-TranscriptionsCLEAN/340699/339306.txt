only time I have to make good and it would be suicidal to ask for leave now and spoil all. As you see, my time for collecting data is comparatively short and I must use it to the limit.  so as to substantiate any claim I may put in for post-bellum preference. I cannot see, unless some person elects to back me, that I can do better than try for something that should give me a living after the war.

Things on the front seem to be going well, but the "Justicia" was a nasty knock.
