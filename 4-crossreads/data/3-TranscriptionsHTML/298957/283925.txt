<p>2nd &amp; 3rd Brigades immediately opposite and there is a larger camp about half a mile further out.</p>
<p>4th February (Friday) Last night we slept in old yellow plaster buildings which apparently have been here since the Canal was first started, used probably for housing the men who worked on the building of the Canal. Trouble with bats, bugs etc. Pipe run across the canal to convey water supply to other camp. A donkey engine does the pumping. Bugle calls to be resumed till further orders.</p>
<p>5th February (Saturday) Again</p>
