2.have held up our train and given us a horrid time and we could have done nothing in return. However, they didn't, and I suppose we can consider ourselves lucky. It may seem funny me commenting on the arrangements made by the authorities, but it is just as things strike me and most likely would strike hundreds of others.
Well, we travelled all that night, and it was bitterly cold, besides we being so cramped up that sleep was out of the question, and arrived at Cairo early next morning (5 a.m.). We then marched out to Abbasseih Camp, some 2 miles from Cairo. When we got there the "Heads" had not expected us so soon and had not made any arrangements for us, with the result that we had to spend all that day until 4 p.m. lying on the hot sand in the blazing sun without any food, after which we turned to and pitched our tents. Next day no rations were forthcoming, and most of the lads had to go without anything or very little. But of course things bettered themselves as time went on.
We started straight away to get into condition and had some solid marches over the sand. And very hard it is too, walking on the soft sand, more especially as we were fresh from a long sea voyage.

Imagine my surprise when he ordered me into the hospital straight away. I had only Influenza, but on account of the very hot days and cold nights, they have to be very careful of colds and that sort of thing, as they very quickly turn into pneumonia. But you need not be alarmed in the slightest. I'll be O.K. again soon now. Have been here some 9 or 10 days and am getting on fine. But there
