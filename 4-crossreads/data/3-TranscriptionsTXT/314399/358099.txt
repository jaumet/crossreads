Had dinner with the Y, M people &amp; then to the opera. Saw Hamlet &amp; it was excellent. Did me.  Apres the show went for a stroll &amp; then back for supper &amp; bed. 
 Sunday 13 April 1919 Rained all day but cleared for an hour or two in the afternoon. Went thro. a market where they sold everything. Snails, frogs &amp; all that sort of thing. Then went to Sacre Couer &amp; enjoyed it immensely. Had lunch at a small cafe (for a huge price). Afterwards went on a YM Trip on the river. First to the Marne &amp; then to St Cloud. Gee it is some trip. Enjoyed it immensely. The view from St Cloud is beautiful. Got out at St Cloud &amp; had our photos taken &amp; also some tea. Went to the Follies Bergere &amp; the show was good. Plenty of  legs of course. Went for a stroll after &amp; then home to bed.
