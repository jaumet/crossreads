<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Still in Durban.&nbsp; No leave granted as we are leaving for Cape Town this afternoon.&nbsp; Sat on poop and wat-ched coaling operations until noon.&nbsp; My impression of a ship being coaled by the boys at Durban is the nearest thing to the ancient Tower of Babel that it is possible to imagine.&nbsp; Had dinner and went on deck to find that we were making for the open sea.&nbsp; When we got outside the breakwater we ran into a heavy swell.&nbsp; Watched the pilot being dropped and passed the Dutch steamer &quot;Sonoro&quot; on the way out.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Fine day again.&nbsp; Sighted South African Coast again with its mountains and rugged landscapes.&nbsp; Entered Table Bay before breakfast and lay in the stream.&nbsp; Later moved into the pier for water.&nbsp; Took this and provisions on.&nbsp; Disappointed at not getting leave for a fly around Cape Town.&nbsp; Not granted as we are leaving here to-day again.&nbsp; Hope to get on the picket, but no luck.&nbsp; Picket was sent ashore.&nbsp; Larsen and Walker went with them.&nbsp; They had a swim.&nbsp; Walker went in with his wristlet on with fatal results - to his wristlet.&nbsp; Sat on deck and watched proceedings on wharf and else-where.&nbsp; Had a bird&#39;s eye view of the city at a few miles distance.&nbsp; Much struck with the beauty and rugged grandeur of the city of Capetown&#39;s background, which rises straight up, as a range of rugged peaks, to a height of 3,400 feet above the sea.&nbsp; Pulled out from wharf into stream again at 2 pm.&nbsp; Coal lighters came alongside.&nbsp; Watched the men catching young sharks from the ship&#39;s side.&nbsp; Found the day warm and balmy but a great improvement on the heat of Durban.&nbsp; Had tiffin and afterwards the Colonel gave a concert to some of his friends from shore.&nbsp; Did &quot;Gunga Din&quot; and &quot;How the Chestnut Horse came Home&quot;.&nbsp; Well received.&nbsp; During the concert H.M.S. &quot;Kent&quot; - our convoy - and H.M.T. &quot;Argyllshire&quot; arrived in port.&nbsp; Then turned in on the deck, as usual and slept.&nbsp; Found out the real reason of leave not being granted is that men from the &quot;Borda&quot; played up while on leave and that owing to sickness on&nbsp; on our ship the doctor would not grant a clean ship.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Fine and lovely day.&nbsp; Cape Town looks very pretty, especially with all the vessels in the stream.&nbsp; The &quot;Argyllshire&quot; steamed into the pier for water.&nbsp; Rose 6 am as usual and looked around until 7.30 when we had breakfast.&nbsp; Had throat swabbed as a precaution against Meningitis and other troubles.&nbsp; Also a Formalin Tablet three times to-day.&nbsp; Our company did guard and supplied fatigues.&nbsp; I was on Bakery fatigues and got some bread and cakes.&nbsp; Also saw sports on deck.&nbsp; Supposed to go into the apple-bobbing race but was not on spot at the time it was held.&nbsp; H.M.S. &quot;kent&quot; moved</td>
