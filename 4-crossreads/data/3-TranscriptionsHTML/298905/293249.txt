<p>trenches for our own, both rifles seem to crack alike out in front, but there is one point which is always worth noting &amp; that is the flares for the squareheads use about 10 to our one &amp; they are a much superior &amp; bigger flare than ours<br/>We had this morning (Sunday) a blanket, gas helmet, &amp; rifle inspection it was only a short affair &amp; we were then dismissed, 2 of my section were sent to hospital this morning, one of the chaps had "the wind up" (an expression for scare) one night &amp; gave a false gas alarm.<br/>The boys have a daily routine of our work here, this is their version of it  11 hours "stand to" 12 hours work &amp; 1 hour for meals all the rest of the day you can have off for sleep &amp;etc.<br/>There will be a big fatigue party leave here tonight, I am on one of the jobs.</p>
