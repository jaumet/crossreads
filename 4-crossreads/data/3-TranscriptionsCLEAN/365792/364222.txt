May 17 Went to short sing song & service (C of E) & rather enjoyed it.
18 Had a chat to Sister last night & then straightaway slept until the Orderly woke me at 5 am & wanted to wash me. Guess I can do that little job myself.
Went for a little stroll to the head of the lane - The Channel lay- shrouded in a thick fog blanket, through which issued at odd intervals the roar of a fog horn from an incoming liner. The sail of a fishing smack, the Pier-head & a few scattered rocks close inshore were dimly discernible. -The night orderly looked rather hard at his slippers this morning, because don't you see, I pinched them last night. Going to England tomorrow, so hope the sun keeps shining. Today has been glorious. A waterplane just slipped in from the Channel, dipped lightly into the water & thence into the Harbor. They'll be having aerial submarines soon.
