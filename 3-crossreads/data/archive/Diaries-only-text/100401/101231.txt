 Going in the shelling in parts was severe, but at the R.A.P. things are very quiet. One carry to Pill Box at Railway Dugout was very hot in parts. A Canadian attack on Paschendale within 48 hrs Italian news still very bad. 200,000 men 1800 guns
Tuesday 6
 From all accounts this mornings stunt was entirely successful the village of Paschendale being in Canadian hands. It is to be hoped that they can hang to it. Very few Australian casualties. Often bad luck still follows us this morning we had three killed one badly wounded. "Snowy" Walters was among the killed, a fine little chap. (cp. Sat. 3rd)
