I stood on the ridge commanding the outlook to the Aegean Sea drinking in with all my soul the beauty of the blue rippling sea, the roughness of the landscape and the sky studded with white clouds like heaps of wool.
Sunday 4th NovTo-day all our guns opened up with a tremendous bombardment of the Turkish Positions. The place was a babel of noise and the Turkish Artillery commenced to return the fire and added to the Inferno. I went to the Y.M.C.A. Canteen for Headquarters this afternoon. It was a lovely crisp day. Kitchener is reported to have spoken to some of our lads to-day on the beach.
