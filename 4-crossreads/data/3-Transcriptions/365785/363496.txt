<p>a great many years about 20 I think.  She is religious &amp; is industrious &amp; dresses tastefully &amp; is "just the thing" in every way.  I gave her a ring with a nice pearl surrounded by 8 small diamonds which she chose herself &amp; which I admire very much.  I can't persuade her to marry me before I go unless they keep me here about 6 months &ndash; which is not improbable as others have been kept as long &ndash; because she wants time to get her trousseau together &amp; wants her sister who is a Sister at Mena Hospital to be with her at the time &amp; other reasons.  Her name is Edith May Green, &amp; Gooloowan, Victoria Avenue, Canterbury, Vic. is her address so I see her when I am lucky enough to get leave.<br/>With many thanks &amp; kindest regards to you &amp; the Doctor &amp; love to Margaret.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,<br/>Arthur M. Davidson.</p>
