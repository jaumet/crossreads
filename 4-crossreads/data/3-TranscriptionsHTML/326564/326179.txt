<p>little boozer, with the intention of having a bit of fun, we all sat around a big table &amp; the mob of us threw in as many francs as would do us for the night, the pile amounted to a bit over 100 francs, the drinks began to circulate freely &amp; the call for Madame was very insistent, kept her going filling the glasses, after a while the lads began to mix their drinks, champagne was called for to give the beer &amp; stout an extra bight &amp; snap this soon settled Pricey for his head began to droop &amp; he got sleepy but the majority of the lads stuck it out, I never laughed so much for a long time for I was as sober as could be had only 1 glass of light wine &amp; a dash of champagne</p>
