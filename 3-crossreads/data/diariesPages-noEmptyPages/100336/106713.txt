This can be added to what I have already said about Gelebek. Nearly every morning a train load of Kurdish refugees came in, this was due to the Russian advance in that part of the country. These people came through in a terrible starving condition and it was a frequent sight to see dead dragged from the train. One morning in particular I can remember, myself and another Englishman were working with a German soldier putting a small steam crane together close to the station we were standing watching these people get off the train, a man jumped out of a truck dragging a dead child about 12 yrs of age out after him he did not carry the body but just had hold of the arm dragging it along the ground when he thought nobody was looking he threw the body in amongst a heap of iron rails, the German immediately ran after him catching him a blow on the back of the head and made him take the body away and bury it.
