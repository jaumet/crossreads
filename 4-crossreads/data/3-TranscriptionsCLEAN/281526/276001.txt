  
 10/12/17 Mt. Kemmell Up betimes to see our N.C.O.s School of Instruction make a beginning. About 32 all told. A fine sunny morning and mild. The usual fatigues having been taken out, we bathed the remainder in Locre. Inspected the huts and found them none too satisfactory so accordingly got the O.C. Coys. up and put it into them. At the same time issued orders regarding the polling for the Referendum. Rode into Locre about 2 pm to a football match with the 21st. and after a good game they beat us owing to our lack of system. Rolland was here to lunch and before him came Colonel Heron of the 3rd. Division who is going to relieve us here. German Gothas over today dropped bombs. Later on a propaganda balloon floated over. Copies of papers were dropped from aeroplanes near our Camp. Had dinner with "D" Coy - they had decorated the hall very fittingly and we had a great feed. Toasts and songs made the night pass quickly.
