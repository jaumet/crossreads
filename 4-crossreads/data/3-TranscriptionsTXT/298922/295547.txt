 KHAN YUNUS [The following sentence crossed through.]  My letters are following me. I got the M.O. to sound me, only Bronchial trouble &amp; much better. 
 We get good potatoes from CYPRUS ISLAND now &amp; fresh Beef so all is well. 
 We are in sound of the GAZA GUNS but quite safe here &amp; all ranks enjoying the spell. The FIG TREES are all bearing now &amp; PRICKLY Pears. The latter are soaked in water for 2 hours &amp; the spines then rubbed up with a rag, quite good.  Love to all.
