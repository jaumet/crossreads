  
 I have to report at 8.15 AM ready to march out to the orderly room. 
 We left camp at 9.45 AM, we marched behind a draft going to France, the band played us down to the station. We had to wait some time on the station, the band played tunes & when the train left the station the band played Auld Lang Syne, such a send off for such a small party only 36 of us. It was 10.45 AM when we left Codford, had nearly an hour to wait at Westbury where we changed trains. We are arrived at Weymouth about 2.45PM & marched to Westham Camp (about 1 mile) had tea, then I went into the town to do some business. Though lovely mornng it was raining a little here. 
 Friday, dull & threatening looking. I left with a party for Little Moor Camp about 4.15 PM, it is about 3 miles outside
