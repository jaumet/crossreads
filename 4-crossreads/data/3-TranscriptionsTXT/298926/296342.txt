state of perpetual pecuniary embarassment.  The only thing is we have no stamps and therefore have to curtail our correspondence temporarily.
March 1st  Our leave has been extended to 5.30 and we go out every day now we have our clothes.  Today I went down to the theatre on palace Pier and saw a very interesting play called "Sappho" from Daudets book.  The acting was not too good but it was an agreeable change to us.
