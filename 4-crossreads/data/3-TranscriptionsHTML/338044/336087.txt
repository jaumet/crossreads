<p>I will here outline the usual routine of the day. Reveille 6 am., Breakfast 7-15 am. Of course we should get our meals at these specified times, but owing to the usual rotten military arrangements it sometimes takes a half to three &ndash; quarters of an hour &amp;  sometimes ten minutes only to get it.  Our orderlies wait at the cook-house lined up all this time waiting for the food,- (such as it is) whilst we cool our heels at the table after the bugle call.  9.30 am. Dress for Parade  10 am Parade.   A.M.C. do not fall in but do our ordinary shift of work   12 noon &ndash; Dinner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 pm  Parade    5 pm. Tea. Canteen open from 1 pm to 5 pm. No soft drinks, but we rushed the preserved fruit &amp;  now buy biscuits &amp;  chocolates only. Very convenient?</p>
