<p>I shall very probably remain unless kicked out which is not beyond the bounds of possibility I brought Bernard over with me by bluffing a bit but today to my great sorrow he had to go back to the unit as they are very short of horses &amp; the 1st bgde is moving tomorrow towards <strike>Haifa</strike> Jerusalem</p>
<p>However before I left I got a couple of photos taken of him But it is sad to lose him after two years and I had grown absurdly</p>
