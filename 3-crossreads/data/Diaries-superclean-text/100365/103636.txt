a letter to-day, giving my experiences from the time I last wrote to the present chance to it getting throughYesterday some Allemandes dropped Bombs on Amiens just after we passed through killed several French womenThe majority of French women are very loyal I have seen them in all kinds of trouble just say, Vive la France."Things are hurrying towards a big offensive in this region where it will end it is impossible to say at present.The weather is bitterly cold here none of us can keep warm.
