 30/3/18 ? La Bass Vill befor dusk . At 7.30 went up the line and walk round to La Bass Vill where I saw my two fire line O.Cs and Major Dooley have a yarn . The place was all drip and wet . The Billjim stand to arm were all encas in ground sheet and all fair cheer . Some of them were not wear their water-proof becaus out on patrol or on wire parti they glisten . A shrewd old bird is our Billjim . Back to Bn . H.Q . call first at the R.A.P. The night was most devilish dark and we kept tumbl all over the shop .
