Tues. Nov. 6. Weather brightened up. Went out on crutches again, but my bloomin’ Hat is too small & it makes my head ache. Wrote Mrs Pudney. Chap brought postcards of ward, not Bad. What the dickens to write about I don’t know but this Book must be filled up somehow. There was a Concert on tonight, but I had to wait for my Leg to be dressed, & by that time it was too late. Another new doctor this morning, that makes 3 now, in a week. I don’t like this Hospital at all & shall be mighty glad to get away. The doctor said there was only one thing to do with my Leg, & that was to remove the piece of shell.

Wed. Nov. 7. Things are kept going in this Ward & the sisters certainly earn their pay. As soon as a Bed is vacated, another patient comes along & fills it. The photor brought along the enlargets of the Polly Mincher photo, & they turned out real good. Wrote to Aunt Nell. If Mrs A.J. doesn’t appreciate the good work I have put on her cushion cover then she ought to.

Thur. 8. Was X rayed again this morning for the 3rd time. So now I can look forward to the Pictures again. Four chaps in our ward were operated on today. I got up quite early & dressed, but it was too wet to go out. After Tea went to Concert which was most enjoyable.
