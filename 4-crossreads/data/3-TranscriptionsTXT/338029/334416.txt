night.
Wednesday 21stMoved into WooloomoolooWharf and as soon as the boat moored the embarkation staff came aboard and there was a wire for me.  Sergt. Morris, father dying, return at once.  I was broken up and could do nothing I was so dazed.  The O.C., Officers and men were all sympathy.  Our kits were left behind for fumigation and as we went down the gangway, we were met by motor cars who took us through cheering crowds to Rose Hall Convalescent Home - there we were entertained by kind V.A.D's.  I could appreciate nothing.  I wandered round Sydney until the train went.  Cheers, flowers, fruit and gifts were showered on us but I felt too low spirited to appreciate it.  I worked till twelve up and down the train checking patients and caring for the mental cases, turned in in sleeper compartment and slept well.
Thursday 22ndArrived Albury 5-30 a.m., had breakfast then on to dear old Melb.  The train could not go fast enough for me and we arrived at Spencer St. at noon.
