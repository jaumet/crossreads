There are also two cushion covers one for each of the girlies, a small brass tray for Trix and a native head wrapper for Amy.   There are also for the children beads galore collections of stamps &amp; coins &amp; a piece of the Xmas cake from the Kyarra.<br/>I think it would be just as well to sterilize the whole darned lot &ndash; boiling wouldn't hurt any of the precious things.   I also sent a book of Luxor views &amp; copies of the first half dozen photos I took with the new camera.<br/>I will be sending more photos probably by next mail.  I rarely see Fred he is the man what does the disinfecting, he looks much cleaner since he has been on this job &ndash; perhaps he occasionally goes through the disinfecter himself.   He is also very fat &amp; comfortable looking &ndash; too much manual labour I fear is his trouble.   And now I must end up with heaps &amp; heaps of love to all the dear ones &amp; not a little to your own dear self<br/>Yr Loving husband<br/>Will.<br/>PS.  Many happy returns of the 10th for Peter.   God Bless him.  W.H.R.</p>
