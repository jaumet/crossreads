<p>June 4th, 1918<br/>France</p>
<p>My dear Uncle &amp; Aunt<br/>Your very welcome letter of 6/2 arrived a week or so ago and I was very glad to hear from you.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that my letter of October '17 date did not reach you with the small photo of dear old Alans last resting place so we must hold the war to account for its non delivery. However, I am glad you did get a photo of the grave, it was very decent of Bruce Rainsford to send you the photo. And by the bye thank you ever so much for sending me the enlargement, it is a very considerable improvement on the small <strike>photo</strike> one.</p>
<p>Within a dozen feet of Alan's grave is the name of another Fry from N.S.W. of course no relation and within the same distance the grave of a very great chum of mine from Marrickville, the youngest son of Ald. Clarke, one time mayor of Sydney. Poor old Dene was buried just in rear of the trenches at Hermies &amp; at the time</p>
