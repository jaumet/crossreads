Wrote a few received a couple of letters. Evenings getting longer. Every time I finish after each meal I generally go over to Jim's room where I write or have a lay down. Ern lobs in occasionally too.

An aeroplane came down in Durrington a little village quite handy. The chap was killed the thing dived in  out of sight making a big hole. It lobbed in the backyard just missing in a street of houses. Got a little bit of a splinter from it.
