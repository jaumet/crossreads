<p>On the night of 24th April, 1918, the Australians made a daring and clever counter attack in the darkness, recaptured Villers-Bretonneux, stopped the German advance and saved Amiens. This, and the Battle of Hamel, were only a prelude to the smashing advance which commenced on 8th August.</p>

<p>85,000 Australians were engaged (with Canadians on their right and British Divisions on their left) supported by powerful artillery, tanks and aeroplanes. In this battle 7,000 prisoners, 150 guns with an immense number of Machine Guns and war material were captured.
