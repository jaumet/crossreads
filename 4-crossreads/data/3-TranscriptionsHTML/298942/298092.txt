<p>Capt Young &amp; Sergeant [indecipherable] come round every night to see that all is well.  Tonight they told us that we might be leaving for another post in the morning.</p>
<p>Friday 3 May</p>
<p>No cases this morning despite the fact that Fritz was shelling the hollows in front pretty consistently.</p>
<p>At about 3 p.m. Rogers &amp; B. came along with an order for me from Capt Young to return with all equipment to the central relay post.  (n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> ear wagon loading post)</p>
<p>Saw the others on the field</p>
