22/5/15Still treches [trenches] on Quinns Post can't show your nose above it in day time. They even broke several of our telescopes its too damm easy to shoot straight at 25 yards. Things quiet we use some new big bombs thrown from a mostar [mortar] which keep [kick] up at [as] much dust as a 6" sheel [shell] moral effect on the Turks very good. Rained this morning and trenches connecting with support trenches very muddy and slippery.
23/5/15Rotten day very damp and muddy no fighting doing but we and the Turks exchange bombs during the night, one man injured. Gerald Fox (whom [who] came over with out [our] reinfircements [reinforcements] officer in charge in my part of trench had a yarn with him. Major Chisholm (of Light Horse) came along during the night trying to improve our trenches to fire from by making loop holes with sandbags &ndash; Relieved about 12 noon and went to out [our] digouts in the valley for a spell. Shortly after we got there Bill Whiteform formerly our cook was shot dead near me either by a sniper or a stray bullet. Hands very sore and have several boils on my anatony it is a month yesterday since we landed and we have been fighting mostly ever since. The stench from the dead around the trenches on Quinns Post if very bad. In one place the trenches are only 12 yards apart. Received letters from Mother. Had our first issue of fresh meat abd [and] grilled sun [some] and had a good square feed had a good sleep which we badly needed as we were 48 hours on end without any sleep in the firing line on Quinns Post [Quinn's Post]. Our big bombs seems [seem] to be shaking up the Turks [Turk's] trenches.
24/5/15Armisice [Armistice] all day till 4 p.m. to bury the dead seems very funny not to hear the rifles and big guns going and very quiet. A lot of our chaps our [are] burying the dead. Both sides came out of their trenches and stood on top round about our chaps and yarned to some the Turkish soldiers who could speak English as soon as all the white flags went down rifles [rifle] fire started again. Our chaps way they saw hundreds of dead turks [Turks] on the left.
26/5/15Down in Gully digging saps to protect us against shell fire on our way to and from trenches.
