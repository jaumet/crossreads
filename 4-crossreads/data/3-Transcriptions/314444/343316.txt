<p>Belah<br/>April 2nd 17</p>
<p>Dear old Mater,</p>
<p>Must send you a few lines now that opportunity offers.  We have not had much time for writing of late, in fact have had a very strenuous, &amp; dirty, tho' exciting time.</p>
<p>They managed to get a mail through to us last night.  I got a letter from you, one from Phyllis, a photo of Wilma from Syd. also the parcel which was sent back to Aust. &amp; one from Tasmania.  Sorry to hear of your bad knee &amp; hope it is well again now.</p>
<p>No doubt you have read something of our doings here during last week.  But I will tell you what I <strike>rember</strike> can of it from memory.</p>
<p>We left Abu Shunnai on Sunday 25/4/17 at 2 a.m. &amp; marched towards Gaza.  Reached Belah at about noon <strike>on Monday</strike> &amp; camped.  Thousands of infantry, Light Horse, Cavalry, camel corps, artillery, transports, red cross carts etc. all on the march presented a wonderful spectacle. (when one could see through the dust)</p>
