Friday May 25th
Havre : good day : reveille 5.30 am : fell in 7.30 am in full order & marched to "bull ring" : interesting training but too much messing about before & after going : the fools over us don't seem to realize that we have got heavy packs on all the time : concert in Y.M.C.A. after tea & it was a splendid affair worthy to be on any stage at all:
