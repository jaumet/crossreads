<p>Jan 31st 1916<br/>My Dear Judge</p>
<p>Many thanks for your second letter which was held up, I think, by our evacuation, but followed me to England where I received it this week.</p>
<p>I wonder if you ever received my letters about Maclaurin &ndash; in answer to your first letter. I have a photo of his grave (which is on the hill named after him, quite close to where he was shot) &amp; it is to be printed in</p>
<p>[Addendum written on side of page] As I wrote to you about Nov 16 I have some fear that the letter went down with some 20 others of mine in the mail tug which foundered on Nov 17th. C.E.W.B.</p>
