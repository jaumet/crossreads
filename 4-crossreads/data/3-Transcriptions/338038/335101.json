<p>II<br/>days without firing a shot, other times we are putting it in all day. Today for instance the Turks are putting the shells in pretty thick, but when we can't locate their Batteries to reply to we just simply crawl into our "dug-outs" like a lot of rabbits and let them blaze away and waste ammunition.<br/>One consolation, we are in a very healty part and nice climate. Looking out to sea from our position we can see the Island of Imbros about 15 miles off and a little to the North the Island of Samothrace.<br/>Everything is going well now. Tucker is plentiful and we occasionally manage to get down to the Beach for a swim.<br/>Major Caddy, whose Battery I am in is an awfully nice chap. Wonder</p>
