 Dear Mum, This is the Hospital where Ellis spent 5 days. His bed was first out of the Bay Window under the X. I went down one night. It was a late night, the People of Le Havre having given them a blessing. I had some of the wine  & sandwiches etc.  &  we went to the Concert in the big ward which was once the main entrance Hall to this Casino. I stayed there talking to Ellis  & others until 1 pm   &  then hurried  off Home. Of course this is a Summer picture. There is very little Bathing now. It is a lovely day today, as mild as a Spring morning. I am waiting for sinner now   &  I shall do nothing this afternoon but write letters, for the Cat's away this afternoon. Love From Harry
