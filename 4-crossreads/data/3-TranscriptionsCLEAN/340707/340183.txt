  
 55 which I had made no arrangements  but  & though I tried to meet my American friend failed yet spent a very interesting day 
 5-7-19 Met Madelon this afternoon at 2 pm also her friend. We were going to Louvre but day is so inviting that we change our plans & visit St Cloud the chateau of which was destroyed in 1870 by the Germans. 
 The lawns are not green & springy but rather neglected. The grounds are exquisite long shady avenues & quiet rotunda in the basin of the fountain you find a reflection prettier even than the trees themselves. I have bought 21 pc  about  of this spot & they describe place much better than pen. 
 We see some chairs on top of Trocadero - the Emperors private garden & go up & seat ourselves Soon after a young women comes along & demands 10c each though there was no notice to show that chairs were not public property. Any how the view was worth the 10c & we sat there for over an hour overlooking Bois de Boulogne & Paris. 
 Then we wander through the private garden where no artificial lines hurt the eye. The garden is a rustic wilderness with a lake & kiosk
