<p>Friday 26 October 1917<br/>Rose 5.30 a.m.  Land on both sides.  Gulf of Suez entered 2.40 a.m.  How grim look the shores of both Africa &amp; Arabia to us.  A rugged line of hills standing close to the shore &amp; not a trace of grass or trees.<br/>Here where Moses of old led his followers across the Red Sea to safety we go to do our "bit" in a strange land.<br/>Trunks are up &amp; finally packed &amp; everyone struggling to fit lids on boxes that have somehow grown smaller since starting.</p>
