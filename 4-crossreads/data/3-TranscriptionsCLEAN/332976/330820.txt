  
 March 1917 20th   To day the company have been working between Millers Son & the bottom of the ridge (Bappaume Ridge) making a Pack Track for Mules & horses carrying ammunition & rations forward.   Our water supply is obtained from a small well in the village (Most of the wells here have been destroyed or poisoned) 21st.   We had a fall of snow during the night, but it thawed during the morning.   Our section started to fill in a large mine crater in the road between here & Bappaume & have made a fair impression on it.   The crater was about 50' across & about 12' deep & right on the intersection of two roads, but we hope to have traffic through to-morrow.
