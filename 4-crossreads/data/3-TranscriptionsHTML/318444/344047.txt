<p>Tues mar 18th:-<br/>Left London by the 6.10am from Waterloo Station to Tidworth &amp; sneaked into the Park house Camp a day late.<br/>Rumour says that we will be on the move to Sutton Veny in a few days time.

<p>Thurs Mar 20th:-<br/>Left Park house Camp &amp; went by train from Tidworth to Codford &amp; walked to Heytesbury depot. Made out an application for non-military employment as it looks like never getting a boat home &amp; these camps are "eyesores  &amp; earaches". All you can do is sit down &amp; "mope". Snow is added to our troubles.</p>
