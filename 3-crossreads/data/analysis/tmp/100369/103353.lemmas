The Turk had a veri strong posit here , a strong fortifi redoubt , be the chief difficulti . They also had possess of the water suppli . Some of our lad had been out here sinc the morn befor and onli one bottl of water in that time . All day the struggl for this posit went on , and all day the wound kept pour in . Some were bad case , but the spirit of the Australian boy when wound , is a thing to marvel at . Never a word of complaint , never a grumbl escap ani one , and the eager to stand by and wait while someon they reckon wors than themselv , was inspir . What wonder unselfish spirit they are . Sever good Officer were lost here . Shot dead . Oh , it is a piti sad thing to see a fine young fellow , all his life befor him , talent and physic strength second to none , to see him brought in on a stretcher , with his brain bespatt the canva and call perhap in a voic piti weak for a love [one ] whose voic he will never hear again in this world , whose hand is too far away to sooth
