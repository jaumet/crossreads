 morning. He boarded her on my behalf &amp; established a naval guard, instructing the Captain not to leave before my arrival. As I could not leave the "Rheno" till she was anchored, however, the Major preceded me. I followed as soon as we had got our cable. The "Gabriel" is comfortably arranged but resembles a Noah's Ark, being exceedingly top-heavy. There were two passengers aboard bound for Hatzfeldt Hafen &amp; one priest on his way to Alexis. These were transferred to the "Witu" during the following forenoon &amp; left for Hatzfeldt, the soldiers on the "Witu" transhipping to the "Gabriel". During the afternoon the "Lili", "Rheno", &amp; "Davapia" came alongside &amp; discharged their cargo &amp; passengers into the "Gabriel" which will now proceed to "Eitape", the remainder of the fleet returning to Alexis &amp; Madang. The "Lili" is to again load up with coal &amp; meet us at Potsdam in a few days. We are now (6 pm) passing through Dallman Hafen &amp; expect to reach Eitape before daylight. While at anchor in Potsdam last night we found a fly in the soup. It happened thus : The number of soldiers aboard the Gabriel is about 60. They were all asleep on the upper deck, the lower deck being set apart for the native crew. I have mentioned that she is top-heavy, &amp; with the extra weight on the upper deck she became very tender. During the night she got a list to port &amp; gradually canted more &amp; more until at last there was a crash in the galley, crockery smashing up galore. The skipper was practically sleeping on his head; I was asleep on the bridge &amp; brought up against binnacle; Capt Morrison found himself halfway through the taffrail, &amp; some of the men found their hammocks swinging over the port bulwarks. The port boat was lowered &amp; the cargo was shifted to starboard &amp; she righted herself. The skipper has announced that the upper deck must be kept clear &amp; that the men must keep below day &amp; night. Verily a fly hath been found in the soup! When O! when, shall we find a craft worth the name?
