All night we passed Camel loads laden with fruit going to Jerusalem natives only being allowed to use the roads by night for transport.   Men are still dropping off from Malarial &amp; we all hope we have seen the last of the Jordan for a bit.  OLEAC has done me a lot of good thank you for thinking of sending.
