Such is like, in a war Hospital.   On Thursdays & Sundays visitors come round   some of them are very nice, others I fancy merely curious - One lady came in Soon after we arrived, she was in hopes that she would be able to find some of the Old 17th from Gallipoli, her son was reported wounded, killed and missing.   I heard her telling one of the men near, and heard her say:  That a Mr Price had written to her from Sydney telling her that inquiries had been made at Head Qs but that no definite news could be obtained.   You bet when I heard the name mentioned I immediately thought that it must be Mrs. Horton but when she came and asked me if I was one of the 17th I knew that I was mistaken.   Her son was out in Aus. and enlisted.   I fancy they are fairly well off.   one of her sons comes in sometimes to bring a couple of us books etc.   I had a letter from Mr. Horton a few days ago asking me to go down and stay with them when I am fit to leave the Hospital instead of going to a convalescent camp.   I hope I can manage it   I also met a youngster belonging to the B.E.F. Salvage Dept. in Albert, he gave me his home address and said that His Parents would be very glad to receive me at any time.   Some of these people will do anything at all that lies in their power to help and give a wounded soldier a good time.    I guess a great many of our monied men could come here and leave quite a lot, but I will not start on Comparisons   On the 23rd at 7 a.m. we walked across from our trenches to Pozieres, our company should have gone in allmost unscathed, but no we did as we were told and found ourselves under our own guns, for awhile they kept us thinking.   I can tell you, if anyone had offered to bet me a tenner against my Pocket knife, that we would see daylight on Sunday I would not have accepted for fear that I might lose the knife.   it was hot, one Shell burst somewhere
