 June 19 Rested all the morning.  Scotty &amp; I explore the bazaar &amp; town.  The place is absolutely desolate &amp; portion of the bazaar has been burnt by the Russians before their evacuation.  Very little stuff of any description in the bazaar, and dire poverty rampant. 
 The surrounding country is rather pretty.  Bijah itself is built at the head of a valley, running from the North East.  To the North &amp; NW the land rises to rolling hills, while the other part of the city is surrounded by steep mountains.  A sentry group is posted on the heights above our camp, owing to its suitability as an O.P. which overlooks the road from the North, North west and South to Hamadan. 
 From information received the people have been dying like flies owing to famine &amp; cholera.  Rained for about 5 minutes was the first we have seen since Kermanshar.
