 JUNE   TUESDAY 27   1916 
 A warm day, but it rained most of the day, & blew very hard. We had a lecture on "Notes from the front" and the fuze of a shell in the morning. M r  Raymond lectured us. Had no lecture in afternoon but I had a little buzzer practice. The A8 was a long way behind the other boats.
