  
 Ward Orderlies are allowed twenty-four hours a week off and also one week end in every two. With regard to your trip to Sydney of course I will be delighted to see you. As to your bothering me in any way that would be impossible, Douglas must think I am having a gay time when he makes that suggestion. You evidently misinterpreted my letter. I merely wished to let you know that I could have very much time off to spend with you so that you would not be disappointed. As to my leaving here before Xmas there is not , at present, the slightest prospect of my doing so. I think the trip would do you all good. My slender stock of news is now exhausted so I will conclude With best love to all Your loving son, Eugene.
