<p>The ship's course this afternoon is very near S.E. There are no classes today, in order to give the lads a rest to recover from their tour of the Cape.</p>
<p>Friday April 25 1919<br/>A beautiful day. This morning there is nothing but a world of water with a few seabirds to look upon; the blue sky and a few clouds. We will have a similar outlook for nearly 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Sports were to be held today &ndash; Anzac Day &ndash; but they have been postponed until Monday. The Ships Paper was issued today. It is called the "Shropshire Blimp" and is a good souvenir of the trip. It was printed in Cape Town and contains a photo of the Shropshire. There were several short articles by myself in the paper including the First Prize Short Story, and a second prize, Reminiscence. The paper is sold at 9d. though its published price is 6d, and it finds a ready sail.</p>
<p>The course today is about 5 points S. of S.E.</p>
<p>Saturday April 26 1919<br/>Easy day sail from Cape Town. [written in shorthand]<br/>The shorthand classes were resumed yesterday and carried on today.</p>
