<p>at the time the preparatory bombardment was at its height &amp; then moved on to the A.D.S at <strike>Becourt.</strike>  [in margin Becourt near <strike>La Boiselle.</strike>  Here we turned in until morning &amp; slept through the most terrific gunnery until 5 am when we moved to the Aid Post.  Such a scene of desolation I have never imagined, the land being simply pock marked with great shell holes of the English bombardments.  The villages of Contalmaison &amp; Pozieres were simply levelled &amp; the High Wood bared of all but a few stumps.</p>
<p>Along the road were many mangled corpses &amp; the wounded have been coming in very quickly.  Last night the 1st &amp; 3rd Brigades charged &amp; established themselves on the outskirts of the village of Pozieres, Contalmaison being already in our hands, but with heavy casualties.  Our work was hard &amp; we suffered about 20 casualties including three killed.  Dock &amp; Bantry both being wounded (Rest to memory.  We have now come out with the Division &amp; are now [stretcher] bearing at the hospital for the 2nd Division who charged but owing to missing barbed wire, failed in their objective.  Heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Aug 1st  We are now resting at Warloy.</p>
<p>Aug 2nd  A party of 20 including myself have been sent on to Puchevillers where we are doing the local bearing for 44th C.C.S. [Casualty Clearing Station]  Things are not too bright &amp; the food is far from the best, the head receiving the name of the 4th Batt Green &amp; white.  The sisters vary as to personal charms etc.<br/>A congratulatory order was read out to us re the "great gallantry'(?) displayed by the 1st Field &amp; we have been congratulated by Birdie.</p>
<p>Aug 4th  General Birdwood to-day spoke to a party of us individually, &amp; told us that to-night the second attempt by the 2nd Divn is to be made to gain German trenches.  He is indeed a fine chap &amp; speaks to men as affably as if we were on the same plane as himself.</p>
<p>August 9th  Leave Puchevillers to-day after a week's work &amp; a good time?  Although none of us were crimed it was not the fault of one of us, what with arguments with the NCO's &amp; nurses.  Arrive at Halloy-Genoes.</p>
