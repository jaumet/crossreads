<p>Raining nearly all day. Still on baling up the old clothes etc, we have nearly finished now, &amp; I am not sorry either, there were close on fifty bales altogether, I think they have been saving it all up for about 12 months. Three of us have been going some pace in supper of a night time here, the order is generally two eggs on toast, a cup of tea, raspberries &amp; cream, &amp; cakes, we want it too as the tucker in camp is getting worse each day.</p>
<p>Thursday July 19th<br/>Miss Lena Ashworth's concert party gave a turn, in the Y.M.C.A tonight, it was very good too. A big draft arrived from Australia this evening, there were about 30 a.m.c men &amp; 20 A.M.C Officers. They report seeing wreckage &amp; dead bodies two days from landing, &amp; it was rumoured that the Hospital Ship "Karoola" was sunk. It isn't official though.</p>
<p>Friday July 20th<br/>The lad who broke the Corporal Military Police's jaw, was identified by the corporal &amp; arrested today. A very nice day after the rain. Had to go back to work after tea, owing to two waggons of boots, &amp; clothes, coming in. Mending bike &amp; acting locksmith today, the other day I was sanitary king, it is marvellous the jobs a person gets.</p>
