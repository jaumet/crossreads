<p>On Piquet all day in charge of Gas Gong.  Three of us, whilst walking through the village tonight were hailed by civilians to do a little favour which required "First Aid" "experience".  London Rifle Brigade arrived from Ypres, also the Shropshires.  Some of our division came out of the trenches today, having been relieved by the "Tommies".  Antiaircraft shelling throughout the day.</p>
