  
 have given some of them pure hell. 
 We got back here, Amman, last night & they say that we are staying here a week yet.  A current rumour throughout the regts. now is that we are going back to Jericho & there the 1914 men & unfit horses are going to be sorted out.  The fit horses & men are then going up north Damascus way & the 1914 men are going to Australia.  I see in the Kia-ora News that the Furlough has been granted.  Personally were it not for considering what disapointment it would cause at home I should be inclined to stay & see the war out.  I don't think it can be much longer now.  Still I suppose a man had best "get in while the goings good".
