Sunday 21 AprilParticularly quiet on the front all day. Glorious day & there has been much aerial work.  Our post is just under the shadow of the Mont des Cats. Two stretcher cases from the line.
Monday 22 AprilTo-day has been very hot round our Aid Post & Fritz has shelled us all day.  He obtained one direct hit on our house & wounded one chap fairly badly.A very heavy bombardment on our left. I think things will be quite warm about here in the future.
