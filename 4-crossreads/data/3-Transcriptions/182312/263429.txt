<p>long been known as &quot;the Nursery of the Western Front&quot; - a picnic</p>
<p>compared to any other bit of the line!&nbsp; These are little things</p>
<p>which Australians at home ought to know and they should realize</p>
<p>that we have yet to show that we fitted to share the line with</p>
<p>such tried troops as the famous British Regiments and Canadians</p>
<p>now here in France.&nbsp; Every Australian soldier who has been in</p>
<p>the line here (I exclude Cairo &quot;Anzac Heroes&quot; and the heroes from</p>
<p>the pay camps in London and the like) will tell you the same thing.</p>
<p>They read it all with disgust - the don&#39;t want all this publicity,</p>
<p>all they want, all they hope to be is good soldiers equal to the</p>
<p>Britishers they have come to fight beside.&nbsp; The British Regiments</p>
<p>and the Canadians make raids on the Hun trenches nightly almost,</p>
<p>but the raiding parties don&#39;t get leave for England:&nbsp; they are not</p>
<p>driven round London in motor cars nor fed with strawberries by the</p>
<p>Lord Mayor nor paraded in the London streets to be cheered, no, its</p>

<p>their job.&nbsp; I actually saw in the Daily Mail where&quot;Londoners</p>
<p>will to-day have an opportunity to cheer the party of Anzacs who</p>
<p>so gallantly raided the German trenches the other night in France.</p>
<p>The party will be in carriages and will pass such and such points</p>
<p>at such and such a time.&quot;&nbsp; Could anything be more idiotic than</p>
<p>this?&nbsp; Imagine, if you can for one moment, the feelings of British</p>
<p>and Canadian troops in the trenches when they read this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear that I have been rather long winded on</p>
<p>this subject, but it is one that I, in common with practically all</p>
<p>other Australians xxxx - at least all I have come in contact with-</p>
<p>now in the line in France, feel very strongly on.&nbsp; Mind you, I</p>
<p>don&#39;t for one moment contend that the Australians did not do good</p>
<p>work on the Peninsular:&nbsp; everybody knows that they fought well and</p>
