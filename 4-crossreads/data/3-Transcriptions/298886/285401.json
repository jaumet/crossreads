<p>have gone away to Tireah this morning to relieve Corpl Trail of the 1st Light Horse Signallers. who <strike>are</strike>have been  forming a Signal Station from the 3rd Light Horse Regiment at BIR HOOKAH in Western Egypt. I have had to hand nearly all my signalling equipment to Sergeant W Nelson the Signalling Sergeant of the 1st Light Horse to complete them. This was the cause of it. The 3rd Light Regiment Had their signal gear blown to pieces by one of the Goeben's shells (pity the lot didn't share a similar fate!) Then; months after when we evacuated the Peninsular the 3rd L H Regt came back to Egypt and prepared straightaway to go out again to Western Egypt. In doing so they commandeered the whole of the 4th Light Horse Signal Equipment.</p>
