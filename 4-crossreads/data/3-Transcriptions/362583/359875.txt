<p>Gallipoli<br/>20th. Nov. 1915</p>
<p>My Dear Mother,</p>
<p>According to all accounts the last batch, if not the last two batches of letters I posted, have been dumped in the sea somewhere off Anzac. If all the hopeless seamen imaginable those chaps who navigate our lighters are the worst. If there is the slightest microscopic ripple on the water, you can bet your last dollar that nothing will be either landed or shipped, &amp; just as well too, because when they try, everything goes down. In my last letter, which probably you wont get, you probably wont remember I prophesised the duration of Turkey's persistence, &amp; still being of the same opinion, only more so, this part of the war will probably be over before you read this. I'm afraid the last sentence is a bit complicated, but as I long ago made a resolution not to reread or alter a letter after it was once written, it will have to be left as it stands. All my mails are arriving regularly &amp; I'm having a ripping time, so don't let anything worry you.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son<br/>Arthur.</p>
