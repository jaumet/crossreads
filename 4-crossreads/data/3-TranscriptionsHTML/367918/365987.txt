<p>4.<br/>so I am doing my best to get a light car to take the boy down to the Pasteur Institute. I am afraid there is a good chance of him going out altogether before he reaches Paris and Paris is the only  place where any thing can be done for him.</p>
<p>My horse is likely to be demobilised any day now. I shall be dreadfully sorry to lose her, she has been a great friend to me and has been with me for over three years</p>
<p>My Medical officer is in bed sick and my Dental officer is nearly driven mad with toothache. I suppose that is just as it should be</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
