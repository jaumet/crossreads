<p>I have enclosed a parcel for Miss Rhoden, so if you just send her a P. Card, telling her the parcel has arrived she will call for it &ndash; The address is on it.<br/>Sister Calvert also has enclosed a small parcel  &amp;  I think it has an envelope on it, with instructions. Sister said something about sending it by carrier but I've forgotten now.<br/>We are only allowed a certain amount of luggage &ndash; so must reduce mine in this way. You will find Les. Peel's camera  &amp;  mine in the bag. Give his to The Peels to forward to his</p>
