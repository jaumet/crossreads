<p>My Dearest Doris</p>
<p>After a fortnight's holiday in England we are again travelling this time it is for the Dardenelles.</p>
<p>The first half of our holiday I spent at Tidworth I have described this beautiful place in my last letter, the latter half I spent at Southampton &amp; I might say it was the time of my life, the people simply lionized us. I made quite a lot of friend, I also managed to visit a Lodge meeting &amp; spent a most enjoyable evening. I will endeavour to detail how I spent the week.</p>
<p>Monday. Arrived at Southampton Dock Station 4 P.M. was conveyed  in Motor Lorries to the Rest Camp, tea 5 P.M. spent the evening with some people my Pal (Eric Mills who was stationed at Southampton all the time we were in England) had met.</p>
<p>Tuesday. I was detailed as N.C.O. in charge of piquet, managed to get into town for a few hours.</p>
