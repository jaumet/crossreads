<p>My dear Babs</p>
<p>This will be only a wee note as I'm going like H, have got marching orders for France again &amp; go over in a couple of hours time.  I had some difficulty in getting them to send me, but I succeeded eventually as its the only place to be with all this fighting but things look pretty black I fear, however when I get over &ndash;</p>
<p>Am feeling fit again &amp; my leg does not trouble me much &amp; I feel right enough for an Ambulance, I do hope I shan't crack up, it would be most ignominious.</p>
