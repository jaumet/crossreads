Work as usual until 12.30 pm  After lunch Legge &amp; I take a tram to Boisguillaume (William's Wood) &amp; enjoy a nice walk for about a mile along a road of an avenue of fine trees to the wood    &amp; enjoy the fresh air. Farmers working in their fields, logs drawn for fuel on long carts &amp; best of all, pure country air. A beautiful of the whole countryside around &amp; in the valley from the hill &amp; no doubt France is a great country.
