  
 October 1918. Sunday 6 
 In rear of Joncourt. On left Ramicourt. Day broke fine and clear. A great deal of bombing by Fritz planes who have held the air all day.  Went forward with Clive to Bty position on the outskirts of Ramicourt. Grabbed a fairly decent dugout  for Spooks pit. And built her up a little with some frontal protection. 55th had no dugouts so their spooks can pad with us. Only Tom Code ,Charlie Adey and myself left up here. Stunt rumored to be dwelling . Yanks relieved Tommies.
