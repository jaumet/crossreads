only one who is not a regular bombing Sgt. In their Battalion, after this was over the whole lot of us were marched down to our parade ground we done an hours physical training but it was nearly all games we had a rare bit of amusement.
The afternoon being a half holiday 3 others I took the opportunity to slip up to the baths at the Infantry School to see if we could get a wash, but our luck was out for the baths had stopped for an hour or two, so we spun the bloke in charge a yarn, he gave us each a clean change of new clothes this done us down to the ground so we came back stripped off had a cold water bath took our breaths away for a start but it was bonza after the first shock of electricity was over.
