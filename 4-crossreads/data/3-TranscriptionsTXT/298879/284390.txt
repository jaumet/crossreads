June 1915Sunday 13Fine We left Gallipoli Peninsular about 3 AM this morning and were well in Muedross Harbour by 9AM. Landed on the Island about 12 PM and were fixed up in our respective tents at 2 PM. I have been placed on milk died. Enjoyed a good undisturbed night's rest.
Monday 14Fine windy. A Turkish aeroplane dropped bombs or tried to on the camp here yesterday but they dropped in the water. Am feeling better today. Many French, Algerian, Singalese and British troops are here. It is a relief to get away from shot and shell and see a little civilization again
