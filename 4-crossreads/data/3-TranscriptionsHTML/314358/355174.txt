<p>From 1654 Sp G.O. Hawkins<br/>7th Field Coy Engineers A.I.F</p>
<p>Southampton Docks<br/>England</p>
<p>26 June 1917<br/>Dear Beatrice and Dear Mother</p>
<p>Have sent other hurried letters to explain that I am off to France.  I had no opportunity of posting them myself, but handed them to a girl carriage cleaner at one of the stations through which we sped, on our way from Brightlingsea.  She promised to post them; so that will be all right, for girls don't forget matters of that sort like men.</p>
<p>Here, at Southampton we have already de-trained and are now waiting to embark,</p>
<p>But as usual the army, in its actions, is slow.</p>
<p>There seems to be nothing doing for a while.</p>
<p>No one knows when there will be</p>
<p>This is the normal state of matters military; so we simply accept it as a sign of good health in the great war organization; and remain mentally neutral<br/>"Mark time in front"!<br/>"Halt!"<br/>"Into line &ndash; right &ndash; [indecipherable] !"<br/>"Right dress!"<br/>"Stand at ease"<br/>"Take of packs"<br/>"Dress packs in line"<br/>"Troops may be easy and sit down"</p>
<p>These were the last orders received.</p>
<p>Look round and you</p>
