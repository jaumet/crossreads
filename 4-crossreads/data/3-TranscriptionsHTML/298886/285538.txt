<p>28th May Sunday 1916 Romani.</p>
<p>Awakened this morning at 3.30 AM. All hands "Stand to Arms" That joke was not so bad on the peninsular because after the dismiss we could all go back to our dug outs and have another sleep But here we have to "Stand to" from 3.30 A.M. and then when dismiss sounds go out to water and carry on with stables no going back to bed any more. Everyone took some shifting this morning. Its always the same on the first occasion</p>
<p>Tomorrow they will be getting used to it more. I have got 6 supernumeries in training The sun is hot here but there are constant sea breezes especially in the afternoon. Three patrols went out at daylight this morning Finlayson Dorricott Smith and O'Halloran went with them. We are issued one gallon of water per diem here as it has to come from the railhead three quarters of a mile away on Camel back through heavy sand</p>
<p>There is just enough water for our Consumption but none to spare  The  horses get water out of the wells and the water is brackish and unfit for Human Consumption being</p>
