7 - patients - for I have some things to say. But darling Mother don't let any one repeat my sayings. I don't mind you giving them to people to read who are really interested though I only scrawl away for you & Dad & the family and often I am afraid say imprudent things - you terrify me when you say something about printing a bit of my letter - if you do such a thing - please don't say I wrote it or that I'm a nursing sister or else my letters & others will all be severely censored.All the news you give me about the family is so interesting to me and the letters you enclose. I will write more tomorrow - but will close this as it is.Dearest love to you and Father and Bill. Con's letters are so refreshing. I sometimes feel all our letters "your family" is a bit like a family I read about once as a small girl in a book written by a Jewish woman - I can't remember the name of the book or writer - But it was about a family like any of varying ages & careers.I heard from Roslyn today and Helen Stewart. I loved their letters. I'll answer them. Love to Edith. Hope she is fit. Your loving daughterBetha McMillan
