despite news far from cheerful.  It is indeed remarkable.  It was a quiet night on the front and we tried to get a Hun dead or alive but did not succeed.  Very dark at first it became lighter later on and movement was difficult.  Our patrols went out into No Mans Land and there is an old aeroplane there.  Lt. (Digger) Barker hopped up into it for a seat.  Six fine dead Huns are lying out in front the result of a raid.  Some of them were carrying little pick-axes in lieu of knobkerries.  Returned back to Bn. H.Q. at about 2 a.m. and turned in feeling very tired.
