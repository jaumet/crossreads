  
 Just seen a wonderfull sight, a german plane got two of our Balloons this evening, the observers in each case escaped in parachutes.  One of the Balloons was only about 1/2 a mile away.  The anti air guns were gunning wildly at the Fritz but he took absolutely no notice.  We could see his tracer Bullets distinctly going through the Balloon.  They were apparently fired from a machine gun.  The second Balloon fell in flames only a 1/4 of a mile away.  It was the pluckiest thing I ever seen. The first train that I seen arrived here today.
