<p>This afternoon I accidentally met Stan Whealy, (Artillery) who was the cadet senior to me for three years in the Mines Dept. He had been wounded &amp; was on his way back to the line.</p>
<p>The evening was spent in the "Soldiers Christian Association" Hut, where I did a little writing &amp; then had a bit of a sing-song. Every evening a short meeting is held here, a few favourite hymns are sung, a short address given &amp; a prayer for the wounded etc tendered before the throne of grace. The address is usually very fine &amp; to the point.</p>

<p>We were paraded as a company, to the Bath this morning. Owing to the number in Camp we can only have a proper bath once a week, &amp; then it is compulsory. The water is as hot as one can stand &amp; is as good as the steam in a Turkish bath. We then struck tents in order to freshen the soil underneath &amp;</p>
