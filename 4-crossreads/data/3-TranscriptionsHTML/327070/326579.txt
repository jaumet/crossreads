<p>it was rather more interesting. Leaving the station I went a little astray, getting into the second street parallel to the railway line, instead of the one next to it, but soon found the Oakleys', Mrs O. &amp; Doris both being at home.</p>
<p>In the evening after tea went to Spencer Pictures, but thought them very poor: it reminded me, however, of the visits to the pictures taken with Oll at Paddington, &amp; I thought it would be the last opportunity for many a long day of "going to the pictures". On reaching Port Melbourne (by tram) in company with a number of my old guard also returning, we found that owing to the disturbances that had taken place in the streets, - conflicts between returned soldiers &amp; military police owing to the former wanting to "deal it out" to Germans &amp; Australians carrying on business, - the vessel had left the wharf &amp; was anchored right out in the bay. It meant waiting until after 12 midnight for the tender to leave, &amp; by the time I turned in it was 1.30.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention that while that while I was up town, I poked my head into St Peters (R.C.) Cathedral, remembering that when I was in Melbourne last time I had been very much impressed by it &amp; had then not looked inside our own St Marys in Sydney. There was a service being held however, consisting while I was there of a repetition in a very perfunctory way of a Latin prayer of which all I could distinguish was "Ava Maria". Altogether it was a most disappointing visit to the Cathedral, but a very enjoyable afternoon &amp; evening, especially as it was commonly rumoured that there is to be no leave in Adelaide.</p>
