<p>to imagine the grand cathedrals with all their impressive beauty or the quaint little shops and cottages which once stood in the place of those ruins, or the gay throng, the patter of whose feet those very cobble stones, now scarred and torn by hugh shell holes, once sent back their cheerful echo.
