9th September Sunday.
Went to Reminghilst to the 54th Australian siege battery. The batteries infantry are all now concentrating around the Ypres, Messines sector will be in action in a few days time. The battery are 8in siege Howitzers, six in number are hauled by caterpillar tractors. They will be placed in position at Lock 8 near Vormizelle about 5,000 yds from the Bosh lines. Whilst l was inspecting the battery, a number of Bosh Aeroplanes came over flying at about 7,000 feet. Our anti-aircraft opened on them they and became the centre of little white puffs of bursting Shrapnel - familiarly called "Archies". They made off successfully dropped a number of bombs killing a number of horses. The Bosh machines are superior to ours in speed climbing capabilities. A few shells passed over the battery fired by the Bosh at long range. 
It was amusing to notice all the men immediately stop work lustily cheer.
