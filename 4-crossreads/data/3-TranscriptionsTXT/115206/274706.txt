 May 1918 Thursday 16 Bussy &ndash;la-Daours Went for a swim during the morning. Weather very warm, with no breeze.  Had a morning run to Fuilloy at 7 am At 7 pm Fritz commenced the first aerial bombardment  since we have been in the village.  We had a frisky time under the strain, a very big pool down by the Daours church greatly patronised  during the heat of the day.
