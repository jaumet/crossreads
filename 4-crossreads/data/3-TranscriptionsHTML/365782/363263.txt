<p>stories about shortage of munitions    &amp;  food    &amp;  coffee etc ending the war.  Money might, but I think the bayonet will, all the same.<br/>Would you mind looking at the enclosed.  It might be good enough for the Lone Hand,    &amp;  if you don't object, the censor shouldn't.<br/>Hoping a lot of things, one of which is that you are still able to hold a glass to the light.<br/>I am sincerely yours<br/>Harley Matthews,</p>
