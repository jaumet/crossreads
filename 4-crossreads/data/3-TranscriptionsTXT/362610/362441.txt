 Sunday 13 August 1916 Still summery. Church parade in the morning, attended by our Brigadier &amp; by General Birdwood who, after the service, presented ribbons of medals won some little time since. His speech was very good &amp; the cheers given afterwards were very hearty. Took things easy in the afternoon, before tea biking out to Rubempre to see Leo : he was well.
