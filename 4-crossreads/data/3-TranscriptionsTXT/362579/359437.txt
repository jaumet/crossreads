 I shall be expecting Aust. letters this week. It seems strange to get yout letters answering mine of last June. I'm sorry I cannot remember that I wrote in letters that have gone astray. 
 There is nothing exciting these days but I'm very well   &amp;  comfortable. Shall be quite ready for fun when on Leave 
 Hope you are all well   &amp;  happy. Must have some tea now to warm myself. 
 Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all. Love to all my friends 
 From Yours lovingly Edith
