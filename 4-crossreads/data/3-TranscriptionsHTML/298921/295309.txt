<p>16 December Thursday 1915<br/>Nearly two months since I returned to Anzac &amp; still a case of "As you were" &ndash; However this state of things is nearly finished now. Blew up the stranded ship at end of Pier today. My Batman has tried hard to catch a fish. Bombing them is now forbidden but this explosion killed a few.<br/><strike>Goodnight Mother dear, keep well till I come home - </strike></p>
