<p>awfully ill. To-day is the first bright day they have had   &amp;  now they will go on well.</p>
<p>I had Friday for a half-day so went to London   &amp;  had a very busy afternoon truying to get a ready made uniform. Have on borrowed garments at present. All mine are in France but expect them over soon. Unsuccessful in getting a dress but some of the other sisters have lent me one or two. Went also to Headquarters to get some money   &amp;  report a few military things. Met Miss Cornwell there, she is Matron at Croydon,   &amp;  is sorry I'm not with her but thinks I shall be soon.  Know this is only temporary but it is jolly comfy. Such luxury I've not had on Active Service before.</p>
