Vhere -  I would not advise bringing an extensive kit - Underclothes I think can be purchased better in Australia than in England, but all other articles could be left till he got to London.  A big cumbersome kit on transports & moving about to Camps &c in England is more than a nuisance
Later 12/2/918I put this on one side finding there was no mail till today - I was round the 110th How Battery today & was accosted by a prosperous looking Bombardier (1 stripe)  Asked me if I remembered him which I did.  Turned out to be one Agatter (friend of the Pitts) whom we used
