<p>Monday 15 October</p>
<p>Beautiful Day.<br/>Run to Anzac Hd. Q. Signallers and again to D.D.M.S.1st Anzac   With returns to A.D. M.S.Office  5th Div. Hd. Q.  Lille Gate  Ypres going via Poperinghe, Brandoek and Vlamertinghe &ndash; Continued on to Advanced Dressing Station up the Menin Road.  Along the main Pop.-Ypres Road the traffic is thick &ndash; Lorries, artillery and troops.  Never have I seen such a busy road<br/>To 1st, 2nd &amp; 4th Div. Rest Stations.  Two of these are on the main Poperinghe-Reninghelst Road &amp; the other is on the way to Boeschepe.  Whilst I was at the 4th D.R.S. Fritz flew over and dropped a salvo of bombs in a paddock not more than 150 yards from me.  The searchlights had him beautifully</p>
