 6/5/19 Marcinelle Last night Madame Mathys a propos wound stripe &ndash; Quel galon glorieux! The wine, weeping like oil, all of very old vintages. Early we were formal &ndash; we finished arm in arm. They stop at the right stage &ndash; this is true hospitality as opposed to excess. In the afternoon went out in a car to Mont sur Marcienne to a good Sports meeting and then returned with Colonels Armand and Davis to Hotel Europa for a cognac. At 6.30 commenced dinner with the Mathys and Jamsins. It was a veritable work of art and the wonderful hospitality of the people passes words. I made a speech in French and there were other responses. A wonderfully good &amp; pleasant evening. The hospitality of the people passes powers of description. To bed well after midnight.
