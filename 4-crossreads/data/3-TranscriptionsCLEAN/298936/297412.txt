September 1915
Monday 13
No sign of leaving so spent another day good in Alexandria.
Have sent several letters to Rita & innumerable postcards embracing nearly everybody.
Discovered the Soldiers Rest which [fills in gap for there I can rest & read & write while Hunter goes on [indecipherable].
Heard some splendid music there.
