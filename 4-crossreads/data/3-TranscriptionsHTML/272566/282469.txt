<p>Friday 26 January</p>
<p>Not disturbed once during the night and all was quiet until we were relieved at 3 p.m.  The weather is still extremely cold and snow covers the surrounding country.  All the water is frozen into ice &ndash; condensed milk is frozen &ndash; in fact everything is.  The tinned foodstuffs contain pieces of ice too.  Returned to No. 4 post, the A.A.D.S. in Gun Alley on being relieved from the Regimental Aid post.  Got into bed as soon as possible to keep warm.</p>
