<p>After walking through the camp I continued on &amp; paid some friends a visit. A mother &amp; daughter who used to do a lot of the Coys washing, after a chat about old times &amp; a drink of hot milk, the daughter told me that they never moved away, they cling to their old home taking their chance with Fritz shelling &amp; bombing.</p>
<p>After the boys had left, the shells were sent over pretty frequent but this home was never hit, &amp; now Fritz is to far away to shell &amp; there is nothing left about worth bombing, it is all quiet &amp; peaceful.</p>
