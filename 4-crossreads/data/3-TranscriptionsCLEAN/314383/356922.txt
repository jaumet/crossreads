  
 horses from the Cavalry, take 6 days supplies &  & 100 in gold & ride out to the rear of the people & protect them. 
 August 9th Haven't had a minute to spare during the last few days let alone enter anything in this diary so will write a brief narrative of the last few terrible days. 
  On  At dawn on Aug 5th we were at Agha Petros's camp to pick up the 100 men.  The chief was there who couldn't speak English so we got hold of a chap who spoke English to act as interpreter. 
 The men with me were Capt Scott-Olsen (AIF) Capt Nicol M.O (NZ) Sgts Murphy D.C.M (A.I.F) Brophy (Can) Cameron (Loval Scouts) Place (Imperial) Nimmo (NZ) Casey (Can).  We had 6 miles loaded with gear & an extra box of S A A.
