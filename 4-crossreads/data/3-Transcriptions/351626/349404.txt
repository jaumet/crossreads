<p>If I owe you a letter here goes  &amp; if I don't well you'll owe me one.  I am not out on parade as my horse is on the sick lines having a slight touch of the mangey   &amp; was looking a bit moth-eaten.  How is shorthand etc progressing?  The flies here a very bad   &amp; cause a great deal of swearing as, if you put a towel over your head to keep them away they wake you up in about 5 minutes humming "get out   &amp; get under"   &amp; you find they have lifted up one corner of the towel   &amp; you can almost hear the ones acting as ushers singing out "this way please". We have a picture show in the camp   &amp; also often have concerts in the Y.M. C. A. tent.  Ask Mother to pay my insurance premium out of the money from the barracks when the Coy send the mother will you.  I owe Connie a letter or two but will write later.  Has she left Ashfield yet?<br/>Love to all Chas</p>
