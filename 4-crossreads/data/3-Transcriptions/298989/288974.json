The Transport a steady lot, old Nicolulla a character on the "heada the quart" (Malish: never mind). Capt Talbot Bde vet, in after ten and yarned. (Leban milk, moyn water.).</p>
<p>Aeroplanes up today. Golf links in the desert near avenue. Naval officers playing with jack tars as caddies. All the rest of the division marching in tomorrow. Dickens went into the town with Snowy to get into touch with Army Post Office. Prices of goods fairly reasonable in the town, Tried several "epiceries" in travels. Searchlights going at night and the warships signalling. The lake here is LakeTimsah, not Bitter Lakes as previously thought. Burns boiled some water and I had a hot bath and then turned in on the floor between a couple of blankets and slept till dawn.</p>
