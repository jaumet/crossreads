 Dear Mother &amp; Father, A few lines to let you know I am doing well &amp; feeling first class. I had a letter from Nurse Weaver &amp; will call &amp; see her as soon as I can get down to London. We are still having plenty of rain. You know those Hughes, who live round Kurraba Rd, well he has just arrived here &amp; was round to see me. I believe Walker Mason is only a few miles from here &amp; will be coming along to see me tonight. In case the photo I posted you went astray I am posting you another. I am pretty busy so will close Hoping you are all well best wishes &amp; love Your loving Son Tom
