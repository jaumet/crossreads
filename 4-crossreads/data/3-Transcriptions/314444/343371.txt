<p>Somewhere in France. 2/8/16.</p>
<p>I am writing to Mrs. Warry when I get settled a bit but I would like you to tell them I was beside him when he fell and he was as brave as could be.</p>
<p>When I look back on what I have gone through it makes me shudder but I feel sure many prayers are being sent up for me, otherwise I should never have pulled through. I lost 75% of my men and out of 13 officers who were in the charge, 2 officers returned, of which I am one.</p>
<p>I am too upset to write any more just now but will write you a long letter when we go back to rest.</p>
<p>I hope you are all well and happy.  Don't forget to pray for me as it is absolute hell here.</p>
<p>Anyhow I have had the honour of being in the biggest battle in history. I expect to get a decoration out of it.</p>
<p>Good-bye and Good Luck,<br/>Yours loving Son,<br/>Walter.</p>
