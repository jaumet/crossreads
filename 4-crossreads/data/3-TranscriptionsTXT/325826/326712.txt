 2.  I think I know the names of most of the things I shall want &amp; I don't care how pigeon-French my language is.  Later   At that point came dinner &amp; after all it is usually at 8 only everbody had been kept late at concerts &amp;c as it was new Year's  Eve  Night and dinner was made later: so I shall not die of hunger every night after all. Yesterday morning I took tram up to 21st G. Hospital by previous arrangement and Rid showed me his little apartment in the funny long wooden hut &amp; any treasures he had accumulated and then took me across to the wards where I was introduced to the matron, a very nice little English lady, and then wrote one or two letters for the soldiers who were either sightless or armless.  By then it was almost lunch time &amp; I had to catch a tram back to the Y.W.C.A  for my repast.  Went up again in the afternoon &amp; did a couple more letters &amp; Rid showed me through some more of the wards.  It was not too easy writing the letters, I find it rather difficult to understand the Scotch, but I loved doing it for them &amp; hope to improve. Rid gave me a great surprise at night: he arrived just as we had finished dinner at the Y.W. saying that he had an hour to spare as it was New Year's Eve, and we went for a walk.  The streets were rather full of soldiers &amp; all sorts and it was very noisy, but we had really nowhere quiet to go &amp; anyhow it was something quite extra to be together at all. This morning I did not go out but did some ironing of little necessaries with my spirit iron and then my packing up ready to leave the Y.W. in the afternoon.  Rid had to come into town for funerals &amp; I was to go with him.
