<p>Signal Squadron<br/>Anzac Mtd Divy<br/>Egypt 29. 7.17<br/>Dear Keith<br/>Whether this will find you or not I'm sure I don't know. I heard of course that you had got in the way of some enemy stuff and since that you were doing well but no details at all. I hope you are OK again now without any trademarks or other after effects. A letter a week or so ago from your father told me that Dr Scot Irving was trying to get you to his hospital. But I suppose its all ancient history now.<br/>Things are very quiet over this way &ndash; as far as we are concerned in the LH at all events &ndash; a few odd stunts now and again but nothing startling &ndash; Therefore the Lord be praised for the summer is not weather for exerting yourself here-abouts. We're getting over it now though.<br/>Im doing a RMO's job with the Field Sqdrn AE and Sig Sqdrn with Artillery Hdqrs thrown in backsheesh &ndash; very little to do. We do pretty well most times &ndash; plenty of canteens &ndash; a regular supply of beer &amp;c in them &ndash; what more does one want.<br/>The Country does me. I thought I was bound for England and certainly was looking forward to seeing you all over there but apart from personal wishes, I prefer this country to what my brothers tell me of France. It has been warm here, but no worse than I've seen it many a time in Australia. The main thing is</p>
