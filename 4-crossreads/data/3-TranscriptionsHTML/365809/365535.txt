<p>Palestine<br/>7-9-17</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I must thank you for the copies of Correspondence ref. Keith's wound which I received enclosed in Dorothys letter a day or two ago. A head injury of some kind was the extent of my knowledge and I feared a permanent lesion when I knew he was to return.</p>
<p>These reports however are quite reassuring and I hope that by this time, when Keith is no doubt with you, after a sea voyage he has quite recovered from at least the direct results of the concussion.<br/>Being fit to fight  again is quite another matter, - but they'll never send him again and if he'll only stop contentedly where his is he will surely be alright  I am altogether glad he is back, both for his own sake and because of the constant great anxiety it will release you and Mrs. Ferguson from.</p>
<p>This part of the war has not begun to froth and bubble yet &ndash; all is quiet or as quiet as can be when two forces are waiting but watchful and expectant. This is the calm  - when the storm will come I don't know but the calm has lasted a good while and I think and most people think &ndash; what the censor won't let us say</p>
