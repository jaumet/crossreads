  
 who married Dr Norman Robertson of [indecipherable] has been in - they rather bore one - can't write or sleep but must talk - well mother I'm truly thankful to be alive I'm not religious but I do recognize I must be protected by some higher hand - & it is you no doubt praying for me in Australia helps - This war should be about over surely by the time I join in again. Electric fan is buzzing & clean sheets - flowers & music - everything a man could wish for - the Turks were indeed good to me to send me here - Now in a big building Napoleon built for his soldiers long ago at ABBASSIINA The papers will tell you about the fight but the Light Horse did it - it was their day out. Goodnight & all my love to you at home - from your loving son  Frank
