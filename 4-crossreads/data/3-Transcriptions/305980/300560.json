<p>24:  After a spell of 21 days on the sand, we moved off at 8 a.m., halting at Fukhari at 4 p.m. &amp; camped for a couple of days; taking over from N.Z. mounteds.</p>

<p>30:  Left Asluj at 6 p.m., thousands of troops were concentrated here, with seven 18 pndr. Batteries.  Gen. Chauvel in command.</p>
<p>31:  After a weary all night ride, we reached our position south of Ber Sheba  attacking at daybreak, infantry pushing on to the main frontal attack.  Our guns simply made the enemy positions look as though they were made of paper, tearing the works apart with every shell fired.  N.Z. men had first success of the day; capturing enemy supplies &amp; wagons with escort, also captured their main wells, which was their objective.  Our Bde. met with stubborn enemy resistance, &amp; to make matters worse the [indecipherable] guns opened on the 2nd regt. killing Markwell &amp; three others;</p>
