<p>11.4.15<br/>Sun. 11th.  Put in a fairly good night, considering we slept in full marching order.  No one from C. Sqd. went to Church this morning &amp; we had nothing to do but lay about the tent all day.  Pettinbery paid us a visit at tea time to say good-bye.  It is the first time I have met him.  They leave at 7 oclock tonight &amp; take the train from Zeiteoun.  We were dismissed from line picquet at 5 oclock this afternoon.  Put the evening in writing, as usual.  A good many of the Infantry tents were pulled down to-day.</p>
