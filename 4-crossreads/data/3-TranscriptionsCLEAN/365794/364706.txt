  
 Tuesday 30 October 1917 S. Moreton on day duty & my cup of humiliation is complete.  Why oh why did I not leave her business alone!  Now I am justly punished, she is kind but oh, so cold & when I weep for a sight of Dr. F. says, "you will will get well quite as well without seeing him".  I weep most of morning & feel relieved - T. 102, 102.4, etc., P. 84, R. 26. Thorough exam of chest again by Capt. C., now they incline to Ty. Lady Super. Miss Oram comes to see me, is kind & cool.  Miss German most sympathetic & sub Matron.  Miss ... also kind.  Capt. C. says they must again trouble me with a blood spec. this time Lieu. Crowe appears, questions me closely & to Aust. & I find knows T'mba.  Ligature is now placed on R upper arm & hypo syringe of blood taken from vein at elbow & poured into bottle with thick fluid. A glorious thing happens - Cobbie bursts in 8 p.m. & just her old self.  Oh the joy of seeing a home face.
