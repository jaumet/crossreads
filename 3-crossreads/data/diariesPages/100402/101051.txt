Wednesday 3 AprilWet to-day.
A walk round to Remi Siding round the district. The view of Poperinge through the trees hop poles across the waving wheat fields is fine, exactly what I pictured of Flemish scenery. This is the third time I have been in this district I like it, in spite of its flatness occasional objectional smell caused by the manuring of the fields. Nothing doing on the Somme but we entrain for there soon.
