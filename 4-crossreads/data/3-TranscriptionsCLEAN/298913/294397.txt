 Port Said is a small place considering the amount of traffic by sea & the position & as is usual, is a native town. It has a very pretty beach which however is dirty & is dotted with a number of dirty bathing houses. The streets are good in parts, whilst others resemble Cairo. The harbour is not very big, but is very thick with traffic & the shipping here is enormous. French warships guard the entrance to the canal whilst a few British warships, monitors & others are permanently stationed. 
 There is an aerodrome on the far side of the harbour & in this place are some big seaplanes. One flew out whilst there & made a great noise, & was well worth seeing. The accommodation of the hotels is good but expensive in the better places. The Casino on the beach is only open to officers & of course is very elaborate. A typical sight in this town is the money changer who sits on the corner & changed ones money. 
 As in Cairo one can obtain light refreshments  at reasonably cost which are served on tables on the footpath. The heat here however is intense & is that moist heat. The canal buildings are on the harbour & are beautiful. Native police patrol the streets & keep the niggers quiet. Native town is out of bounds & is apart from the main town. The town is  not very busy & the main streets are planted with trees on either side that give some shade. An old donkey train is the only means of conveyance beyond the familiar garries.
