now. My hand is quite better now too. I did not tell you anything about it before but I was wounded in back of left hand (shrapnell) but it was only a scratch, breaking the skin  & a small bone in hand. As I took ill the same time I was only officially reported sick. Of course I would have been reported wounded only I got the major to fix it up as I thought it would upset you all a bit if you saw that I was sick  & wounded. Never mind kid as I am quite right now
