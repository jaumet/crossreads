<p>CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES.<br/>RECEIVED<br/>By<br/>1st SQUADRON, AUSTRALIAN FLYING CORPS 1918.<br/> Copy of letter received from G.O.C. Palestine Brigade, R.F.C., to O.C. 40th Wing, R.F.C.<br/>Photography.<br/>The two sheets (J 9 and J 10) of the 1: 20,000 maps have now been published, and as they are entirely compiled from R.F.C. photographs, with the exception of a few hundred square yards, they form a very fine achievement, and probably mark the highest point which has yet been reached in map-making photography.</p>
<p>They have been completed in a very short time and during a period of unsettled weather, and they reflect the greatest credit on all concerned.</p>
<p>The photography involved considerable skill and care on the part of the Pilots, and perseverance in filling the gaps in spite of the high wind. In this connection, I should especially like to congratulate Lieut. Taplin on his work. The photographic sections have done splendid work in dealing with the large numbers of plates and prints involved, and in turning out the copies without delay.</p>
<p>Maps like these are of such great value for the Army when operating in a difficult mountainous country, like that of Central Palestine, that the 40th Wing may justly be proud of having contributed in such a real and tangible way to the success of the campaign.<br/>(Signed) A.E. BORTON, Brigadier-General<br/>G.O.C. Palestine Brigade,<br/>Royal Flying Corps.<br/>Hd. Qrs.<br/>Palestine Brigade,<br/>R.F.C.<br/>23.2.1918.</p>
<p>"The whole of the photography referred to in the above communication was done by 1st Squadron A.F.C."</p>
<p>2.  At the conclusion of his inspection of the Squadron on 7th March, 1918, Major General W.H.G. Salmond, D.S.O. , said:-<br/>"I desire to convey to the Officers and men of the Squadron my warm congratulations upon the splendid work they have done in the past, and are still doing. Their work generally is magnificent, and I feel I cannot compliment them too highly upon it. The Officers, N.C.O's and men at all times display conspicuous ability in the discharge of their respective duties, with the result that they have rendered service of incalculable value throughout the operation on this front."</p>
<p>SPECIAL ORDER OF THE DAY:<br/> H.R.H.The Duke of Connaught personally commanded the G.O.C. to convey to all concerned his regret that the weather conditions had prevented the parade at which H.R.H. had intended to present Medals. H.R.H. expressed his admiration for the magnificent work which has been done on this front by the R.F.C. and A.F.C. in spite of the difficulties of the country, climate, and novel conditions.<br/>(<br/>Signed R.O. No. 76 dated 29th March 191</p>
