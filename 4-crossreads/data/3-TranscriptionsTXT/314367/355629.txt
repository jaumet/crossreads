I wrote in the forenoon but I have more to add - I heard an epigram in the smoke room which is good even if not original - 'Work is the curse of the drinking man'!! said a 30 year old philosopher -Well now the 'juice' is on & all is serene & good -About 2 pm - Skeete of the Una & Lts Patrick & Powell came off in a motor launch towing a boat full of niggers & the C & I joined up & off we went - We went down harbor about 3 miles & got between the island Matupi & the main land - We traveled to a certain corner where we cd see steam coming up off the surface of the sea - It was a hot spring - I cd see the water boiling in it - We got up close - tried the temp & in we hopped - Tell R - though - we had sounded & got 10 feet I struck my chest at 5 feet & scraped the skin off - A rock came up - no great harm & we swam in the hot water & now & again scuttled like anything from a boiling patch - It was an unique experience for most of us - One saw steam bubbles coming up in certain parts & those spots were hot spots - Leakage from the cauldron -
