My dear Ferguson
I am sending on to you a further communication I have just received from the Department of Defence respecting the training of troops despatched from Australia to Gallipoli.  You will see that in order to ensure a high standard of efficiency some recent instructions have been issued in the direction of materially improving the soldiers' knowledge of musketry before they leave Australia.
With kind regards,I am,Yours faithfully,W.M. Hughes

P.S.  I'm doing the best I can with the matters you send along:  but the Defence Dept. is very busy & doing its very best, but of course the machine creaks a bit.  That is unavoidable.
Yours,W.M.H.
