<p>OCTOBER &nbsp; FRIDAY 13 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine &amp; cloudy &amp; no sun. I was in charge of the party getting ashes&nbsp;for the stables again. Its a good job as you have nobody fooling round you all the time &amp; you know what you have to do &amp; do it. Heard we were going to France final week in November for certain. D [[sub?] &amp; Campbell &amp; Raymond went out for a couple of days bivouc with the gun.</p>
