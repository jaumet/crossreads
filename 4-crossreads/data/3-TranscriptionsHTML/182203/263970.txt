July 14th   1915.<br/>My dearest Mother,<br/>It will be your birthday to-morrow  &amp; I do hope you will have a Happy Day. Sorry I shall not be home to help celebrate the event. I can be with you in spirit if not in person.<br/>Well, we are still having fearfully hot weather but manage to work  &amp;  go out still. I'm on night-duty, so work the best part of the day. I'm sleeping fairly well too.<br/>Sister Murray is no night-duty still, so we are having a glorious time together. She is a very well read lady    &amp;  imparts some of her knowledge to me.<br/>My kind friend Capt. Smedley has gone to Alexandria. He had to go last Sunday-morning at 6.30. a.m. Had a note from him to say he arrived safely. I missed him very much. Lt Wright Smith took me out a good deal    &amp;  is an awfully nice young fellow but sad to say he has gone to Alexandria too. He got marching orders    &amp;  left Tuesday morning at 6.30. a.m.  On Sunday I stayed in all day</p>
