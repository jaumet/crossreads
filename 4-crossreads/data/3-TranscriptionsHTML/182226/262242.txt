<p>Sunday 8 August, 1915</p>
<p>Visited Mena hospital met Cecil Watts. He is stationed there. He finds it a bit slow.</p>
<p>Had a ride on a camel &amp; donkey, took some snapshots.</p>
<p>Spent the evening listening to Military band in the park.</p>
<p>Went to see the &quot;Kursale&quot; again for the express purpose of hearing a certain song sung by a French girl. I could sit &amp; listen to her singing all night.</p>
