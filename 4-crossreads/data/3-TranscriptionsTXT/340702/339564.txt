19.6   Have to be very Brief. Very little space left.23rd  G.L  to M W. to W.S./ L to Clare25/6  I have heard that the plane that visited us on the Night of the 23rd was brought down the same night by a couple of ours.

1.7.18 Fritz bombed around here again last night, also Villers-Bocage. There were some civvies, soldiers & kiddies knocked at the latter place. Our aeroplanes attacked the raiders.

Fine weather still continues.
