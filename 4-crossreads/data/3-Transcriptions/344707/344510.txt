<p>the position than I can. My SS M Knight went to the hospital ship today with a bout of rheumatic fever I think. It is frightfully hot here during the day time today being the hottest day but after the sun goes down it is beautiful. How have you been getting on [indecipherable] work if not too pleasant found [indecipherable] engage. Tell the C.O. that the 15 men he has in training will be most useful. I have another 12 myself at work now.  Glad all the horses are fit particularly the roan mare.  If you ever get in touch with Sgt Elliot would you try &amp; get a prismatic compass from my saddle wallet &amp; my quart pot &amp; hang on to them</p>
