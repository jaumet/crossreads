BAVARIAN FLYING SQUADRON 304
Extracts from report on the Evacuation of the Aerodrome at
ARAK EL MANSHIJE
In a conference with the Officer Commanding Air Forces on the 4.11.17 a move to an Aerodrome in Rear was decided upon. This was postponed owing to the urgent need of Pilots. In order to meet the prospect of enveloping attacks, all unnecessary material was sent to a rear Depot as soon as Railway carriages were at or disposal, and the situation demanded it.
On 7.11.17 the moving of material and preparing of a new Aerodrome at WADE SERAR was ordered by the Squadron Commander, reported to Headquarters, and their sanction granted. Transport of 301 and 302 Squadrons was asked for. The transport of 301 could not be taken as it was required, on account of RAMLEH being threatened, to move two Squadrons from there.
At 10,00 a hostile cavalry regiment was reported to have broken through at SHERIA and to be now at UMM DASKAL. About the same time the Commander of a Water Column reported that he had been shot at by hostile cavalry from 2 km. South of the Aerodrome. On account of this report 8 machine guns were placed in position to defend the Aerodrome. On the hill an Observation Post was set up and connected by telephone to the Squadron. The men were at once paraded and taught how to behave on the appearance of hostile cavalry. Ammunition was issued. The 'Place of Assembly' of the Squadron was the dug-outs near the Medical Tent. The Machine Mechanics placed the A.E.G. machines ready in front of the tent, so that the Observer's Machine guns could be used. After the Parade the men resumed their work, keeping their rifles and ammunition at hand.
At 11,00 the report that Hostile Cavalry  were at DASKAL was stated to be false. At 12.00 an Officer of 302 Squadron arrived with lorries, which after being loaded, began to move to the Depot, erected at WADI SARAR. After moving back of transport had already begun, and order was received from Headquarters to start moving back at once. Only one of the Railway wagons could be loaded, and then only with the Photographic stuff and a part of the Wireless and Telephone material because for a day and half, loaded trains only, with engines, had been standing in the Station of ARAK EL MANSHIJE. Loading and dismantling of the camp was continued, also during the night.
2/lt. ULLRICH and 2/lt, SCHELER, as well as Viffw SPIEL and 2/lt. SARADETH, started on a Reconnaissance.
2/lt. ULLRICH returned with the Observer, severely wounded (Shot in the stomach).
In a machine gun attack on hostile camps, the aeroplane had to fly along the sloping bank of a hill and only by climbing against a strong wind was able to escape with difficulty the effect of hostile M.GIs on the slopes of the hill. 2/lt SCHELLER  died in the night of 7/8.
The transport of 304 unloaded in the WADI SARAR, returned to be loaded again on the morning and afternoon of the 8th and was sent off again. 303 promised by wire to send their transport again but was held back because later reports came in to effect that the situation was also threatening for EL TINE and the Squadron itself had to be moved also.
The Squadron had then to make use of its own transport, which consisted of 14 wagons of 3 tons, of which 2 had to be trailed owing to their breaking down.
At 0800 the Commander of a Water Transport Column of the 20th Army Corps reported that he had seen dismounted hostile cavalry near the farm about 100 metres South of the Aerodrome. Shortly afterwards Capt. Felmy, the Group Commander, informed us that yesterday's report of the Hostile
