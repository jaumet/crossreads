Thursday 5.4.17
Relieved at 10 Am marched back to Bapaume where we had dinner moved off again to Bernafay Wood across country another 7 miles; about done when we arrived there but soon pulled together when we had a drop of tea a spell. Country which a few weeks ago was alive with traffic is now deserted.
