No. 2.Troopship KyarraVictoria DockMelbourne1st December 1914.Dear old Mrs,Your letters of 25th & 26th duly reached me also letters from Mother & Margaret. I hope Margaret will continue to write, it is nice to get her letters more particularly when the thoughts expressed in the letter are her own. I was of course delighted to get your letters & hope to hear from you again before we leave Melbourne. There was a great mix up in the storing of the cargo at Sydney & we are at present engaged in getting it all out again - we will probably not be away from here till Friday. You never saw such a picture as the wharf presents
