I've seen nothing of Fritz since we left on the Saty - He's a queer compound - His egoism is so marked that at times I wonder if he's quite right - He had a fracture of his skull years ago - He drinks a bit - When you're in Command - unless you're careful - you are very apt to get swell headed - Living by yourself - Having your own steward - Giving orders & no one contradicting you may bring out the best but also may stimulate many very questionable qualities - A chap in the Ward Room cant develop eccentricities - He'd get too much laughed at - He's got to be very level or he soon becomes a butt for critics -
Friday Feb 19-15-  Beer ran out on Shrove Tuesday - Whisky expired on Thursday aftn. Cider some 18 Bs left. A little Vermouth & Benedictine & all is over - We had a bad day on Thursday - a gale from SE & we took water over & rolled for all we were worth. To-day it is better & the weather fine -I understand that we have the news by wireless that the Eastern got in only on Thursday am - She & the Navua  - if they got our gale - may have had a bad time - especially invalids -
