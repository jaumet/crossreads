It was a fine day. Got up about 10 a.m. and ventured down as far as BdeHQ in the Chateau. Here I saw the General and discussed affairs of state and the plans for our forthcoming attack. Returned and got sketched by Pimblett who missed quite my expression in a sketch but caught it in a caricature. Had some lunch and then all the officers sat in a group for a portrait and then all the N.C.O.s were taken. Tried a man at Orderly Room and remanded him for Court Martial. Two men were paraded about their pay and I fixed them up as well as I could. Feeling tired I then went back to bed and from there conducted a conference of company commanders re our move tomorrow. Read wrote was employed on odds and ends until fairly late in the evening which was quiet
