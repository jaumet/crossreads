Just a few lines to wish you A Merry Xmas & A Happy New Year. Very sorry I'm not home for this Xmas but trust next year the world will be at Peace & I shall be in my "Sweet Sweet Home". You will be surprised at above address but we were ordered on Sunday-afternoon to be ready by 10. a.m. next morning to leave. My our change is for the better. We are under the British but they know how to look after their Sisters. We are very happy too - Aust. Officers    & Orderlies - just an Imperial Matron over us but she seems a most charming woman    & good manager. We are Billetted in a Convent & it is very clean & comfortable - Have about 20 mins walk to our work but very often a car calls for us. We all feed       P.S. Give all my friends my love &  Xmas wishes. Tell them sorry I cannot write. No time    & have been moving about so much. Tell Jess & Mollie - Major O'Brien is here. Must stop & go on duty  A convoy coming in.   Edith
