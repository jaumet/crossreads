2/4/18 ? Shank Hill Camp
fell in and moved down to embus in a column of busses. We paid today and consequently there were a few drunks about the place. The men were looking tired but clean. We marched through the ruined village of Neuve Eglise. Passed long columns of English reinforcements ? in many cases under Australian officers. Many were children of the 18 class and were straggling all over the road. A great exhibition of disorganization. We put 25 men into each bus in the column then set off. The road lay through Locre, Dranoutre and right back to near Mont des Cats.
