arrived the main Dressing station had been heavily shelled causing it to shift its location.  Heavy firing at night the 5th Div. having a hopover, result some 200 odd prisoners, other gains doubtful.Saturday 12th May  Was disturbed about 5 A.M. by anti aircraft guns firing close to us, taubes coming over at intervals during the day.  A & B sections moved off to a forward post leaving C behind.  When I had unpacked word came from C section also to go up.  Packed my boxes to do so of course without growling! Our new position turned out to be near village of Vaulx, the station opened up after Fritz had shelled them out.  There we do walking cases only, the stretcher cases going further back.  'Tis a delightful situation being on a rise where we can see the fields on all sides covered with tents men & horses, mostly transport & artillery horse lines.  We can see the shells landing near the original position of this Station only
