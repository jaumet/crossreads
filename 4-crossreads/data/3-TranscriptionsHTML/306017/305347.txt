<p>June &ndash; July 1916<br/>the same night.  It is a nice little camp in an oasis.  There is a big change noticeable.  Railway in full swing &amp; many more camps.  I got some mail including letters from cousin Carrie &amp; Meg, also letters from Carrie mother &amp; Doug. &amp; numerous papers.  During my absence the Regt had 3 or 4 trips into the desert &amp; got into touch with the Turks capturing some camels &amp; killing &amp; wounding a few Turks.  They also dug some wells at Oghratina which will make these stunts much easier.  There is a fair bit of aerial activity &amp; our machines try &amp; engage the enemys planes as often as possible.</p>
<p>The horses are looking fairly well.  The months spell at Hill 70 did them a lot of good but they felt the first big reconnaissance to the East of Bir el Abd  about 30 miles each way 60 miles altogether in the 2 days.  Many of them had sore backs.  On the 19th the 6th &amp; 7th LH &amp; the Wellington Mounted Rifles</p>
