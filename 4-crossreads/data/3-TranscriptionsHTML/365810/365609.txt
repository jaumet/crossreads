<p>In the Field<br/>4 Octr. 1917</p>
<p>Mr Dear Mrs. Lucas,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your kind letter of 19th July and all the good wishes you sent.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to hear that Caesar has now got his Majority;  he has well earned it and no one can be more pleased than I.  I hope his next step is not far off.</p>
<p>Thanks for the newspaper cuttings of the last night on Quinns, none who were there on that night are likely to forget it.  Yet we had quite an interesting time.  I have in my memory the little supper we had at midnight;  we all contributed something.  It was a weird meal.</p>
<p>I can quite understand the people in England taking up the Major.  He is such a fine chap and no one could fail to like him.</p>
<p>Yes I still hear from Mrs. Pope &ndash; I am a great admirer of hers &ndash; she has done so much for the boys &ndash; I shall for ever be very grateful to her.</p>
<p>Surely I remember Biers &ndash; fine soldier too &ndash; I would like to see him again.</p>
<p>Tell the Major when you write that I will always be very glad to hear from him, I hope you will get none but the best of news from him.</p>
<p>Just now we are right in the thick of the offensive so you will understand the hurried appearance of this letter &ndash; yet if I put aside the reply to a more opportune time I may have to wait long for it.</p>
<p>With very kind regards<br/>Believe me, sincerely yours,<br/>H.A. Goddard.</p>
