March 1918  AprilMonday 1st AprilGot 1 letter only in the Australian mail from Doug.  Cant understand why some letters have not arrived.  2 mails have been missed now.  Usual morning work.  Went to the picnic in the afternoon.  There were 14 or 15 of us at the Pyramids altogether & we had some good fun & took plenty of grub etc.  Felt very tired when I got home.
Tuesday 2nd AprilNo further particulars as to the casualties in the Regt have been received, but Corp Marriott who was to have relieved me here is in hospital.
