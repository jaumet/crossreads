Weather is much finer today hope it keeps fine.
Have been writing hard all day catching the Xmas mail.
This evening Bluey Dimock I went over to the A.S.C to see Ferguson had tea with him, got filled up with a pound or so of juicy steak butter marmalade etc. had a good long yarn then came back armed with a loaf of bread a 7lb tin of butter, not a bad nights work, that's the beauty of having cobbers on these sort of jobs, you can always get a little bucksheesh stuff off them. On our way back we called in at a little Belgian estaminet had a drink of coffee, got a shock for the girl started to curse swear in English evidently some one had been giving her a few lessons she had done remarkably well, a credit to the soldier who taught her, she thought she was doing a fine thing I suppose, but there's nothing I hate
