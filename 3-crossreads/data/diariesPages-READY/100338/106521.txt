At 6.30 in the morning we came abreast of the Gibralta rock, The rock stands out a good distance from the mainland and is connected to it by a very narrow stretch of land, It is honeycombed with gun pits and is a very strong fortress, it commands the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. The action of the sea is crumbling it away in various places along the base.

On Friday the 9th we are well in the Mediterranean Sea and out of sight of land, The crew are spreading awnings across the decks to protect us from the heat of the Sun’s rays, The next day Saturday we sighted the coast of Algeria which we could see quite plainly till after noon, when we lost sight of it again.

During the afternoon we again sighted land on the Starboard side, which afterwards turned out to be a very small island. According to the Ship’s Log, we have travelled 2,500 miles
