Fine weather at last & we move on to El Burj, Col. Meredith has been given 4th Brigade & he wants me to go as Staff Captain - My chance of a majority here is possibly good but  I'll go if sent for but it means leaving the old 1st L.H. Near here the Syrians are starving & the Bedouins are out to robb & kill friend or foe, I mean Turk or English. Poor Armenians have been killed & starved to death in 1000s.
2 enemy planes bombed us but our Archies bombed them, one horse hit by empty shell from Archie. These fall all around us from above after missing the enemy.
