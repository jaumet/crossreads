<p>What did you do in the great war, Daddy</p>
<p>The childish treble rings</p>
<p>Hush, child ask questions not</p>
<p>For I did many things</p>
<p>Know ye babe your pater braves</p>
<p>An Anzac Jack was he</p>
<p>Who in Edgeware Rd was a customer bold</p>
<p>When the publican&#39;s beer was free</p>
<p>What did I do in the great war Child</p>
<p>Tis, well that you should know</p>
