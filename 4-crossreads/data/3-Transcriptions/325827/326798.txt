<p>Dear Father,<br/>I received your letter at lunch time today along with one from Ol and I felt I must write in reply and chance it catching some stray mail to Australia. I will write to Leo as asked by you and will try to keep in touch with him as far as possible, and will do what you say re loans. He will need his 1/- a day, and a little more in Egypt I think, Ol said she thought you looked worried when saying Goodbye to him. Well I think the future will be brighter than the past.  <u>In privacy feel it</u> (though you may have it publicly soon) we &ndash; or at any rate the Australians are withdrawing from the peninsula, and I think Les will go where the situation is not quite so impossible. The peninsula is Stale mate and will be.</p>
<p>Egypt cannot be in it for heat with NSW with its bushfires. I am sorry it is so hot as I remember how the heat used to make you limp and worn out.</p>
<p>It was so good to go across to Adelaide with Ol. it means so much to her and to me as well. I am learning more and more the beautiful home love with which Ol has been and still is surrounded. I only hope that the trip will do you so much good and fit you up for the rest of the summer there. Saying goodbye at Adelaide would have been very hard and I felt quite sorry for you as I read your letter. Selfish-like I am looking ahead to the arrival at Pt Said or Suez and am apt to forget  your feelings over there,<br/>I do not think I can meet Ol except along</p>
