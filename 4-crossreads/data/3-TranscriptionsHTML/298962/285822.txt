<p>The officers came at night time. They started to make a feast, and obliged my sisters to serve them. While they were serving, one of the officer caught one of my sister and tore the dress from her shoulders, so that she stood with bare breasts before him. He then took her in his arms and kissed her. When my mother saw that, she took a fork, and drove it in the officers arm. He went away without saying a word, and next morning, my mother  was arrested, court-martialled, and sentenced to be shot next morning at 6 o'clock, for having assaulted a German officer. Despite the pleading of my sister and of the American consul, the sentence was carried out. The told me too that the American Consul was taking charge of them, and that I had not to worry about them.<br/>Being satisfied on that point, I made my mind up to escape. During the night I slipped through the window. There were no guards. I walked all night, and hid myself during the day. At 3oc. In the morning of the 24th I was picked up by a flemish paysant, who took me to Furnes in his cart. T am having a good rest now, but I hope that the day after tomorrow I will be able to go to the front again.</p>
<p>16) October 27th<br/>I am leaving for the front today. The Germans have massed half a million men and 5oo guns to smash</p>
