<p>The sun was very warm to-day but the weather otherwise was fine. Dominoes occupied part of the evening; bed at 9.P.M.</p>
<p>Nov 30<br/>We were surprised this morning to notice how the time was flying and we wondered if the time since we left Sydney seemed as short to you as it does to us.</p>
<p>A 1rude awakening' was our lot this morning. After getting my dixie in the cook-house line at 4.30 I was just nicely tucked in my bunk again when the warning was given that the decks were to be hosed and so 5 A.M. found us with hammocks rolled &amp; stowed away and enjoying the glorious warmth of the rising sun.</p>
