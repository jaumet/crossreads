5 January 1916 WedSailed for Alexandria at 4 am. Every soldiers issued with life belts which were never to be out of their possession. Escorted by two destroyers. We zigzagged all day in consequence of submarine supposed to be in the vicinity. All lights out. Could not even light a match to smoke.
6 January 1916 ThurDestroyers left us during the night as we were now considered out of the danger zone. Mess-orderly with Bob [Potter]. Robbo is rather sick. Met Frank Noble & had a long chat to him also an old school chum by the name of Matson from Newtown. Sea exceptionally calm & all in good spirits.
