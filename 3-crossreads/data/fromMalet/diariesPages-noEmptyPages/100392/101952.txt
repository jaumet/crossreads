got any all sorts of shells are falling about both small and large it is very dark; I can hear that snipe rat tat tat away over on the ridge and think of that mate of mine that got a bullet in the legbut a burst of shrapnel a little way over to the left draws my attention it has a spiteful burst and as the water in shell holes splash up I know it was not far away and and whissing huming nose cap goes thud in the mud
