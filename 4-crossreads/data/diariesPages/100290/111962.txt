Thursday
A rumour gained currency this morning that the 1st Field was not to go into action just yet. Great disappointment among the boys. Issued with steel helmet.
Move of from Vadencourt wood not back, but foward still to next village take over casualty clearing hospital for an indefinite time. "Chatty" blankets. Hunt for a feed, 1/3 rations "no bon". 12 a crowd in tent. Fierce fighting going on foward. Germans shell Albert heavily. Numerous casualties among Australians. Admission to hospital bullet wound in hand self-inflicted.
