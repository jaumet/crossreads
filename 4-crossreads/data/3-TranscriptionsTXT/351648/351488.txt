 The camp I'm in now is some 5 miles behind the front line but batteries surround us, &amp; we occasionally get a shell or two, but we have a good view of everything &amp; can watch the intense shelling that goes on a few miles farther in.  I've never seen anything to equal it, the row at times is simply terrific &ndash; Oh! its a damnable war, I'm sick to death of it &ndash; all ones friends are getting killed or wounded. 
 News from Australia has been very scant of late in fact there have hardly been any mails &amp; those only small ones. 
 Hope John &amp; the nipper are well &amp; that you too flourish. 
 Best love J.B. Metcalfe
