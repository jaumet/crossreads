<p>Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>April 10th 1919</p>
<p>This letter is to wish Dad Many Happy Returns of the day &amp; also to tell you that Ellis is on board ship in Glasgow and will be sailing in about a week's time from Devonport where He picks up the returning Troops.  He with another Sergeant &amp; 20 men are to run the Hospital on board if any of the men take sick.  We had tea to-gether in Salisbury spent 1&frac12; Hours to-gether before He went on through London where he had arranged to meet Dick Toppin.  I am being sent away to Park House to-morrow on another job but I won't mind.  I can't get away for 3 or 4 months no matter what turns up &amp; there is only half the work over there, so I'll have more time for study (I am taking Book-Keeping) &amp; more time to roam in the fields &amp; the sweet old lanes &amp; villages round about.  Dancing is over, Hockey is over, Cricket begins but I shall not take it on this year.  I am not lonely because Ellis has gone.  It will be grand for you too to have one of us Home.  We could not get away to-gether.  The Valentines will not be Home for some months yet either.</p>
