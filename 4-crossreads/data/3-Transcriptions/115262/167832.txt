<p>Tuesday 6 March 1917.</p>
<p>In camp. Our unit went out into the hills all the day and built improvised kitchens (field);&nbsp;shelters;&nbsp;and other requirements for camp sanitation.</p>
<p>Everybody disgusted still at the alteration of embarkation.</p>
<p>Came in at 5.30 pm and our O.C. announced that all orders regarding embarkation were cancelled.</p>
<p>(Boys nearly mad at this news.)</p>
