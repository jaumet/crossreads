29 ThursdayPaid  2 pound in afternoon, being paid 13/0 overpaid & my word it is just the time it was needed too, as there is a rumor to the effect that we are getting 5 days leave from Monday next.A new Warrant Officer arrived from Harefield Hospital, he seems to be very strict, & it is what's needed here, to cut out the Keystone ways they have here.  Rained during the evening.  All that went on leave Monday last returned.
30 FridayWe have to start & go right through our drill again, so today we again started on elementary squad & section drill.  Owing to the new W.O. things have somewhat changed, such as falling in in five minutes earlier & on a private section parade ground & marching on to the original parade ground.  It was a beautiful day.  Went to Cholderton in evening.
1 July SaturdayHad to go before the board to show reason why I shouldn't pay cost of knife, fork, spoon, but owing to these being unissued I got off.  Playing cards until tea time.  Went down to Tidworth in evening & got some films, later going to the vaudeville at the barracks theatre & my word it was very hot too.
2 SundayDetailed for duty in sergeants mess.  Went for a walk & took some photos of old trenches etc. in afternoon later developing same.  Somehow the light got in & spoilt about 1/2 " along the bottom of them.
