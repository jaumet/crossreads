 This is a perfect swelter of a day &amp; makes one wish there was no such place as Egypt. Late last night J Rolfe called on me to say goodbye as he has to go to Tel-el-Kebir to-day. We have also been ordered to hold ourselves in readiness to shift at a days notice, but goodness only knows where to.  I believe they are rushing our complement of men &amp; horses through so as to get us away. There is nothing much to report as we are only engaged on ordinary transport duties, which are beginning to become a little irksome.  I wish to goodness they would send us to France or some other place. I tried a new riding Horse last night &amp; nearly cracked my neck in doing so.  Four of us went out on a 7 mile ride &amp; going through Matarieh we opened them up to a gallop.  My beggar proved to be both touchy &amp; a stumbler &amp; fell twice but I managed to free myself.  He wont do Richard so &ndash; Reject.  On returning home I had to take poor old Bill Cousins to Hospital.
