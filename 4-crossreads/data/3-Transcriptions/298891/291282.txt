<p>1917 July</p>
<p>18 Wednesday</p>
<p>Got breakfast with help of Serb man. The lack of order of the English everywhere apparent &ndash; too much individuality. Got dinner with help of Miss Brown with a scalded leg. Off from one o'clock on. Went for a lovely swim. Dr Bennett spoke to us all about malaria after evening meal. Serb class with interpreter.</p>
