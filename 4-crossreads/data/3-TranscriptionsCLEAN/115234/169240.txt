The blighters Troops were made
stand & deliver
Our bands of blue were
known & feared
All Britain we have
scoured Scoured and cleared
At Waterloo & bakerloo
we fought the good fight daily
WhileThough some of us for valoursad to relate
were presented at 'Old Bailey'
So cursed be they who
called us curs
Who trembles at the
name
With buttons bright &
Clanking spurs
Us Anzacs played
