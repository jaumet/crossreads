BLIGHTY  BirminghamRubery HillNo 1 War Hospital4C Ward8/9/18My Dear SisJust a short note to let you know that I am getting on fine. I was wounded at Mt St Quentin on 31/8/18 in the left leg, thigh  & face. That is what no doubt the official list will say. Well my leg wound has completely healed up it was about 3 inches below the knee. My thigh wound has healed up inside but I think it healed too quick as I have to stop in bed today as a lot of matter came out this morning. It was about two inches deep  & about as big as a penny. The wound is about four inches above the knee at the back.I had four scratches on the face the worst being at the angle of the jaw. They have all healed up but under the skin
