Cold at "stand to" and read magazine by lamp light. Let Regimental Sergeant Major try his hand at doing the morning Report. Called for doctor and found he had a busy night. Body of Cooper "B" Co killed lying round corner Very thin hands clasped, poor chap bullet thro? head.
Went for swim water churned up a bit cold wind. Feeling very fit. Artillery started early and made things very willing ? Turks shooting not too good. Their 75 shells coming lower than ever previous and clipping the top leaves off the rhododendrons on the parapet outside Shrapnel blowing back into Reg office CO's dugout
Sir Ian Hamilton's farewell order came out General Munro takes over. War declared against Bulgaria. Pte Malloch "A" Co reported back from Malta pale and nervous, crouching when 75's passed overhead so refrained from showing the base of the big shell that blew him up which we keep lying just outside the dugout. Had his wet equipment driven into his stomach but they appear to have got it out again for him.
