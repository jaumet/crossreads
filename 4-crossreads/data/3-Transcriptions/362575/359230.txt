<p>Dear Mrs Jack</p>
<p>Just got your letter by a big mail of 12 letters.  Many thanks for enquiries but am now O.K.  Still in bed but I hope to get out into a chair this week.  I have been down to two concerts in a chair down on the ground floor &amp; this is a step forward.  Wound is now healed &amp; any visitor (who wants to) can see it, makes rather a nice gash in one's side.  Since I wrote last I got a packet from you consisting of a jacket &amp; muffler.  Thank you so much for sending them, the jacket I have worn in bed &amp; has been the admiration of all hands.</p>
<p>The snaps are great.  I have none of myself except the one I enclose trying on a new smoke helmet.  Afraid you can't see much of me.  I can now sit up in bed with comfort &amp; write, it is a rotten job trying to write on one's back.  I think I told you before I have had no pain whatever much to everyone's astonishment.  Of course I have no idea what will happen to me, if I can walk O.K. I expect to be back again in a few months, otherwise I will try &amp; stay</p>
