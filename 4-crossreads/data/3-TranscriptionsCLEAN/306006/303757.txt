Lamp tests held tonight so could not get out & wrote up a few notes instead; Robertson came out today he is down on leave & said Lancy & Small & Kelly are also in Cairo. 
 3-3-17 Sat 3rd Flag wagging before breakfast then rifle examination followed by a Theory test, & then we were finished for the day. Sergt Harris & I did not apply for leave but just walked down to Heliopolis
