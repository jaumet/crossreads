 12th October 1917. (Friday) our barrage for the attack on Passchendaele Ridge opened at 6.5am. about 6.15am the enemy laid down a heavy barrage  of high explosive shells on the regions of our front line, as by then our attacking men were practically mixed with his own. Our men in advancing had severe rifle and machine gun fire to contend against and by the dim light the enemy snipers laid low many a man of ours. Our infantry advanced across the valley and up almost to the crest of Passchendaele village capturing the outskirts. 
 On our arrival at the RAP the night before we had found a few patients waiting to be removed but had to wait till it was light to find our way out. Three of our AMC men had just gone in to the dugout to bring out a wounded Tommy when the enemy bombardment opened. The other man and myself were sitting on the ground behind the pillbox when two shells fell near us, the second one killing my mate Frank Hughes, a bearer who had just joined us and a very fine fellow. This shell burst about 6 feet in front of us. The other shell wounding a signaller.
