<p>Enemy shelled Railhead yesterday &amp; again today. Attended Service, but many heads were turned up to the Sky watching the effect of our Anti aircraft guns firing on Plane directly over our heads.</p>
<p>Murgha MACK is alright, no cancer.</p>
<p>Just posted 2 Field Post Cards as we move out to the big attack tomorrow night &ndash; I'm A1 &amp; so are all the men.</p>
