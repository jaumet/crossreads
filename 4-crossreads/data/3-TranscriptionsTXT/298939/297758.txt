I came down here yesterday evening & was put in H Section.Tomorrow morning I parade in front of the C.O. Col. Marks & present my credentials.
Tuesday 24th April 1917Yesterday morning I paraded to C.O. and he told me what I already knew, i.e. that the ambulance had three dispensers, but one was an infantry man. If his transfer went through he would get the place; if not I would be called up.For the present my services were urgently required for fatigues.So kind of him.
