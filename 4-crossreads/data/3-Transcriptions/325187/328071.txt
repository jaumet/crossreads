<p>Can hear the big guns firing away on the <strike><u>BALKANS</u></strike> about <strike>14</strike> miles away   This is a good harbour &amp; full of <strike>Allies</strike> shipping -   Disembarked troops &amp; took in Water.  All the Mountains are covered with clouds the highest have snow-<br/><strike>Another Hospital ship went down last night either mined or torpedoed</strike>-   I hope these notes reach you without "<u>getting wet</u>"<br/>Have not been able to go ashore but can see all the town with glasses-<br/>I am afraid I won't be HOME for some time yet<br/><strike>It appears the War Office made a mistake in sending Egyptian Officers to Salonika &amp; no one knows what we are to do here so we await Cable re instructions on board ship</strike>.</p>
