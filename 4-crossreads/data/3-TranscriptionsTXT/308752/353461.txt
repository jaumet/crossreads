June 27th. 1917.Myself & two other chaps received unexpected orders to report at the Medical Stores in A for duty. Arrived there at 10 a.m. a very nice job packingdrugs & medical stores etc. living in a comfortable billet & having good meals. This job will do me.  Unfortunately on Sunday the 1st July & Permanent Base men arrived so of course we had to return to our Unit again. On arriving at the Amb. I found near by a big Church parade being held by the Brigade.   General Birdwood, the G.O.C. of the Division were present, also Mr. Holman.
A great number of decorations were presented. Or course plenty of bouquets were hurled at us by Mr. Holman. For the last two weeks a portion of the Amb. section has been training for a competition & an Assault at Arms
