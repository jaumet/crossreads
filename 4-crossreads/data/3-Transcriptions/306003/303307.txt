<p>31.3.16<br/>Fri 31st<br/>Left Ezbet-Soo-Doon at 8.30 this morning &amp; had a good trip back as the day was not too hot;  Had coffee at one of the native villages &amp; was no sooner on the barge to cross the Canal when Darkie took fright &amp; jumped into the Canal &amp; took me with him but had only to swim a couple of yards to get on the barge again;</p>
<p>A lad was having a sleep in the barley this afternoon &amp; woke up to find a 3 foot snake around his arm;  two other snakes were killed as they came out of the old wall, &amp; another was killed in one of tents last night so they are pretty plentiful, also got a centipede in our bed tonight  The extra patrols have been taken off from tonight;  Fleas are very bad bad here but are not troubled with lice</p>
