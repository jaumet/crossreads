  
 10 July, 1916 Rail Head  Romani Slept on the Kitbags last night, comfortable enough except for an inquisitive flea, who awoke a blood thirsty feeling within me, nor was I satisfied until I heard his soul depart the body with a crack.  The miserable waiting here,  We cant get the camels until 4.0, to make it worse a chap has to hum [cadge] all his tucker & I make a poor hum though when it becomes necessary I do it unblushingly - I saw Tom Sherry, he came over to see old Bill off who has gone into the camel corp [indecipherable];  I am sorry I was not able to have a word with the old chap before he left.  The Reg. have been out on another stunt & shot one Turk & captured two Bedouins.  The boys are very much disgusted as usual at the way they are taken out there, get a sight of the enemy & then hang off until he has time to imshie [imshee = go away]
