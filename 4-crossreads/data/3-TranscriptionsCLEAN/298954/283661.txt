  
 Fortnightly!   In a place like this!   We certainly do begin to distribute perfumes quite unlike those of Araby about the 13th day. 
 The bath resembles sheep-dipping.   One files past a Russian doctor (who examines one's shirt for lice) into a dressing room usually packed with with Russians. 
 (The Russian peasant is interesting to meet in the pages of Dostieffski and Turgienev, but as a stable-companion - !   Even to have him existing within some few hundred yards of one is an ever-present insult to ones eyes and nose.)   Clutching one's boots one then passes into the "bath-room" - a concrete trench with some 30 showers.   After the space under each shower is occupied the water is turned on in regulated periods.   Water for 10 seconds - one then has waterless leisure to "soap" for about a minute.  Then another shower - another draught - and a final half minute of plenty.   Ugh!   Mac. adjusted his pince-nez with determination and vowed to remain one of the Great Unwashed.
