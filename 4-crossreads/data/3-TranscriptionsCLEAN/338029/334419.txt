Desert Life
I spilled some water on desert sand.(It's far too precious to waste.)The effect was like a grasping hand,Imbibing in frenzied haste.Swiftly it soaked in the desert's thirst,Like raindrops on furnace firesRaced with the hot wind to drink it firstQuenching the angry desires.
The desert, our neutral enemyHe's partial to neither side -Mocking at mortal's impunityAnd the powers that divide.The sentry rides on the dim skylineof a barren wilderness,A woeful camel train, the only signof life, in his loneliness.
Picture the Bedouin desert born!And his wall of imagination,Picture the Trooper Austral born,And the hot sands inspiration.Our lives seem likened to waterdropsAs we ride through pulseless heatFor man's own soul the desert sops,Achieving his great defeat.
