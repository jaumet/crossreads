it is quite on the cards (though this is my own conjecture) that we will march up through Servia, connect with the residue of the heroic Servian Army and strike for Vienna. Then Austria is sure to cry Enough and the way to Berlin will open from the South. Of course this is a very rosy picture, but we think it is quite probable to eventuate. I should much rather learn my Geography this way, visit Egypt, Asia Minor, Turkey, Servia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, France and England in turn. It certainly is a shade more interesting than sitting down in the Den (eh Percy?) and reading up these places in the Encyclopedia Britannica. It would certainly be something to talk about for at least a fortnight after I got back.
Maybe I should have given some news this week, but there really is none. We are still impatiently cooling our heels and waiting till we get the word to go.
So here's lots of love and lots of luck,
Yours ever,
OL.
P.S. I forgot to tell you that Ailsa is just 5 years old.
