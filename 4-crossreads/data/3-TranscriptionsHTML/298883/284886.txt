<p>After a very tedious train journey we arrived at Oisement where we detrained and did a sprint of a mere 12 kilos to our present quarters here in the little town of Tours.  It was about 12.30 when we arrived, raining and blowing a bitterly cold wind.  Mr. Steber had a heavy task billeting the Bn on his own.  It is a very thankless task and requires a good deal of common sense and patience both of which virtues this very worthy Officer possesses to an exceptional degree.</p>
