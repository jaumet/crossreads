<p>56<br/>on my feet alright. A Sgt tried to do me in for it with a slip but his had the wrong number. It was an Estaminet &amp; the son was a lad about Nev's size. He spoke fairly good English &amp; asked what time I wished to be called each morning.</p>
<p>2/11/16<br/>Got away from Steenvoorde alright in the car &amp; spent 3 or 4 days in Ailly le-Haut Clocher. Left there yesterday &amp; are now in Vignacourt &amp; have a very nice billet. Am a member of H Qrs NCO's mess now &amp; am living well. It's not known how long we will be here.</p>
<p>At Ailly the folk where we messed were fine. Fell in love with Ernescile a rosy cheeked damsel with roguish eyes.</p>
