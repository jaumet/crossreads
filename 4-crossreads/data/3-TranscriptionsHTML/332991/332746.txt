<p>Friday March 9. 1917<br/>It is very cold this morning but not so bad as yesterday.  A german aeroplane flying low came over the Hospital at about 11 o'clock.  The anti aircraft guns fired at it but most of the shots went wide of the mark.  The aeroplane got away but she appeared in a damaged condition.  There is no question but the German aeroplane is superior to the British in speed.  To ours they are as a race horse to a draught.  Their new tactics of flying low prevents our gunners being able to hit them for buildings and other obstructions obscure the view.<br/>Various articles issued by the Victoria red cross were distributed today.  I got a pair of socks, slippers a pair of pyjamas &amp; coat and a face cloth for washing.  In the pocket</p>
