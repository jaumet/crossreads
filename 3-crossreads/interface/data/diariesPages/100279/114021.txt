caught, just jumped in time to save myself
The Capt sprung a surprise this morning he sent an order round that all blankets were to be folded neatly that he would inspect the dugouts at 8.30, well he did so when he had finished he suddenly thought he would have a look at their rifles Gee whiz what a shock for the majority of them hadn't touched their rifles since leaving the Huts, you can bet they were not too clean. it ended up however in 6 of them having their names taken for "neglect of duty" will go up when we get out of the trenches.
8th Took a fatigue party down to Yorks dump but we had a very long walk for nothing, for all the ammunition water had up long ago
