<p>a long drive this afternoon to Matrich to see the Virgin's Tree &amp; Joseph's well &ndash; we all had a drink from the Wells &amp; its beautiful water so clear &amp; cool.  Then we lingered about the pretty Catholic Church there.  I think it's the sweetest &amp; daintiest little church that I have seen.  The delicate colourings of the biblical stories depicted on the walls and the Statue of Joseph &amp; May with the baby Jesus in the central recess of the Altar &amp; which always has a light thrown on it makes it very pretty indeed.  I forget whether I mentioned before but the Virgins Tree is the Spot (if not the original Tree) where Joseph &amp; Mary rested during their flight into Egypt and the water from the well is the water they drank &amp; also the Babe was bathed with it.  The Guides tell you that the Water was brackish until then but had been beautiful water drink every since.)</p>
<p>From there we drive past acres of Cotton fields &amp; Corn fields &amp; then by the Canal.  (The one that leads from Cairo to Ishmallia.)  We chose a spot for tea &ndash; watch the Sunset &amp; drive back.  My two boys seem to have lost their shyness or reserve &amp; open out &amp; speak of their experiences.  Tis seldom they do.  Some are so sad &amp; pathetic that they do their best to try &amp; forget them.  I won't repeat all they tell me but it would help a Mothers</p>
