Dear Sir,
Seeing an article from you in the "Herald" dated 8.12.15 concerning letters received from soldiers [at] the front, I have very much pleasure in sending you these two along, hoping that they will be of benefit to any of your readers [at] The Library.
I take it that they will be kept in good order, & that, when the writers come home from the war they could read them by attending [at] The Library - that is, if they so wished.
Walter Anderson is late of Eastwood; & Walter Hillier late of Mortlake.
I am Yrs respChas. Soloman
