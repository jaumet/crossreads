  
 weekend & amongst other things we saw a revival of "Catch of the Season" quite old of course but we enjoyed it.  Well done & quite jolly & bright, lots of pretty girls. 
 We went to the Row & saw some very funny sights on Sunday.  Also went to a big tea place where they played some good music divinely.  We stayed at Regents Palace Hotel which reminded me somewhat of the Australia but much bigger & very hot.  Wow-wow. 
 I went down to Tunbridge Wells & had a great time.  Mrs. Johnson looks ever so much better I think, she looks sweet.  I met Miss Annie who is a dear.  We had a great yarn & I simply hated having to leave.  Miss Annie's hair is awfully pretty, it is quaint to think she has grown white so early. 
  All  Jimmy has grown a lot & is still a great lad & so amusing, Oliver is talking hard now, he calls me "soger".  Miss Annie wanted to know all about Grahame & fortunately I had taken over a lot of snaps of him & the garden. 
 Miss Partridge is still there & just as nice as ever.
