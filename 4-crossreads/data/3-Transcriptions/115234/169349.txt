<p>has happened again.&nbsp; When the 15<sup>th</sup> Australian Brigade entered this village where I am writing these notes. &quot;Hamelet&quot; they found five thousand yards of the Line vacant, but for the presence of seven British Cavalry men who were prepared to hold this place to the death.&nbsp; They had four machine guns.&nbsp; Just fancy seven brave men resisting an army.&nbsp; It is epic.</p>
