 [AE 11 stori continu ] expel the water in them against the pressur on the outsid ( at 100 feet there is a pressur of 45 lbs . to the squar inch ) . We did not rise to the surfac but shift a littl nearer shore think it best to remain on the bottom till night . We all settl down to tri and sleep again . About an hour after this we heard a steamer pass over us . Everybodi sat up and listen but the sound of her engin and screw slowli die away in the distanc and we settl down again . In about 20 minut we were awaken to the same nois again , but this time she seem to circl round us twice . This was alarm as we thought it was probabl a launch sweep for us with an explos sweep ( an explos sweep is a grapnel with a guncotton charg attach and connect to a batteri in the boat , when the grapnel catch in anyth and it is thought to be what they are sweep for , the key is press make a circuit from the batteri through the lead to the deton in the guncotton charg , explod same . This of cours will blow up whatev the grapnel has caught in ) . We did not move and regular everi twenti minut this launch pass over us sometim circl round us . Once someth struck the outsid of the boat make a loud report in the still , but noth happen . tho we did ?nt need smell salt to keep us awak . At 10 p.m. we got underway to rise to the surfac , After go ahead a few revolut we stop . A second [later ] a loud swish nois was heard outsid the boat and then all was quiet again . At first we thought that a net or wire had been laid round us dure the afternoon by the launch we had heard . We got under way again and stop again as befor exact the same nois was heard again . We came to the conclus that the nois was made by the wash on the shingl on the bottom . We then rose to the surfac and found that noth was wrong with us . It was quit dark and rain a littl and as luck would have it , noth was in sight . Previous to the Captain open the con tower hatch he warn us that we would feel a pressur on our ear , but not to take ani notic of it . Immediat the con tower lid was open , a thick white mist rose off everyth , owe to the bad air , for we had then been submerg 18 hour . As luck would have it noth was in sight , so we immedi start our engin to charg our batteri . It was delight to breath some fresh air again and have a smoke . We were not allow to smoke on the bridg as the smallest light would give us away to the enemi , so we had to smoke insid the boat at the bottom of the con tower . It was not too bad as the Diesel engin were draw fresh air down and aft to where they were situat in the boat , but slight forward of the con tower the air was so bad that a match would not burn for a fraction of a second .
