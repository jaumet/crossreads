our airman at a disadvantage. A quiet day generally. One of the chaps found some German newspapers in a field. I got a piece. They were dropped from a Taube I suppose. This is the reserve line here, so we will have to work for some days. Without a doubt the shovel is mightier than the sword in this section.
29/9/16.
Busy bagging up farm houses and making tramlines with them. We can easily put a farm house in bags when, the Huns have finished with it. The heads are much interested in our feet lately and try to kid me to dress them with some noisesome preparation made with whole oil. It does more harm than good. Dry socks is the solution
