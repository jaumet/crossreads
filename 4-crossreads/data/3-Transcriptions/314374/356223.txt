<p>(39)<br/>Hospital France</p>
<p>At Allonville Field Hospital my thumb was lanced and the nail removed (without an anesthetic of course, as they hadn't any &ndash; naturally I fainted).  I lay on a blanket on the ground here for two days (all the stretcher beds being occupied by serious cases).  My hand was placed in a splint and sling and we left here one afternoon and went by Red Cross Train to Rouen where I was admitted to the Red Cross Hospital.  The Hospital train was crowded.  We were in ordinary box carriages.  Eight walking patients were sitting on the seats (four one each side) and two rows of bunks on top of us containing serious cases.  There was a passage right through side of train.  The nurses were very good and used to come and see us regularly and bring us hot soup, cocoa &amp;c.  There was a canary in a cage hanging up in the corridor near our compartment.  The nurses had put it there to cheer the men up.  The nurses used to come every half hour or so and ask how we were and it was great to hear an English girl's voice again after several months.  Some of the wounded men in our train had been in or near the front line for twelve months without any leave and hadn't seen an Englishwoman for that length of time.  I remember one of the sick men saying that he didn't care how many times the nurses came and asked us how we were, as he liked to hear the voice of a woman.</p>
<p>In passing I may say that the Ambulance that brought me to Allanville [Allonville] Hospital had a brass plate attached inside with the following inscribed on it:-  "Presented to the British Red Cross Society by the Terania Shire, N.S.W., 1916".  It was appropriate that I a Northern rivers soldier, who enlisted in Lismore, should be carried in an Ambulance presented by a Northern Rivers Shire.  Crossing the river Seine at Rouen reminded me very much of the Clarence River.  The river Seine here is very wide &ndash; the rivers we saw when away were generally very small and nothing like the Clarence in width.</p>
<p>This was a huge American Hospital at Rouen.  I was the only Australian in my ward, all the others being Americans.  When the Americans were calling out to the nurses for candy I also used to get my share of same &ndash; also chewing gum &ndash; and as I didn't smoke enjoyed it immensely.  The Americans chew more gum and eat more sweets than we do &ndash; and the chewing gum and lollies were their regular issue &ndash; the same as cigarettes were to us.</p>
<p>Near to our Hospital were camped a lot of Indian Troops (Ghurkas) and they were a fine body of men.</p>
<p>There was also a big W.A.A.C. (Women's Army Auxiliary Corps) camp close to us.  I wasn't well enough to get leave to see the city of Rouen which would have been very interesting.</p>
<p>I was very pleased one day when the Dr said it would be some time before my thumb would be healed up enough to allow me back in the line and that he thought he would send me across to England till I got better.  This was great news as I had only been four months back in France from my previous leave to England.</p>
