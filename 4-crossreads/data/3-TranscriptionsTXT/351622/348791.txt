5 March 1916 SunA chap was brought in this morning from the 23rd Batt unconscious caused through a fight. Poor chap he was only 19 years of age & never regained his senses. At eleven oclock Major Brennan held a Post Mortem & I went to have a look at his body opened up & also his skull taken off.
6 March 1916 MonVery hot again. Kept busy all day as I secured a fair quantity of water & was able to do all my washing. Had a bath to-night in my dixie although I did not have much water it was very acceptable. Rough up in the tent to-night owing to the good news that we are leaving here to-morrow.
