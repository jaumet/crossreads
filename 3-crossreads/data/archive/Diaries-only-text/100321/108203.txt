which were animated owing to Sunday. Could not help being struck by the weediness of the youths and the pallor of the girls. One rarely sees a good looking healthy girl like ours at home. The town is dirty due to so much factory smoke and grime. Had afternoon tea at the mess. The evening was spent in the company of first the lady at Major Berth's billet who produced cakes coffee.
