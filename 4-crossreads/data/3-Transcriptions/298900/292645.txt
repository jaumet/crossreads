<p>smoothly.    Weather still cold with rain.</p>
<p>Friday 8th March<br/>   The last few days just steady going, nothing of importance happening.   The weather has been fine &amp; the cold snap has disappeared.   The inspection by the A.D.M.S. quite satisfactory notwithstanding that it came without warning.   The O.C. afterwards said when talking to me, they tell me that you have been in every job under the sun, referring to the different jobs I have carried out in the Amb, someone must have told him of it as he has not been long with us.  Matters fairly lively on the front as Fritz raided us &amp; we raided him.   The bombardments were fairly sudden &amp; intense.   Mail been coming in well of late which points to an increased shipping service to Australia.</p>
<p>Saturday 9th<br/>    a beautiful day.   Just the ordinary routine going. I get up at 7 A.M. stir out the orderlys, see them on their job</p>
