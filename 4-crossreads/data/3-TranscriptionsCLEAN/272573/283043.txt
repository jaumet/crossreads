  
 Jan 21st 1916 to Sept 19th 1917. 
 This scene was the cause of much merriement amongst the men on board but there was no joke as regards the men who were in the water struggle for their lives. Had leave off duty from 3 o'clock till 8.30. Spent the time with D. & R. stroll through the town of Alexandria. Had a good look around the town. There are a large number of Scottish Regiments stationed in the district. 
 It was like a "breath from the hills o' home" to hear the old familiar scotch dialect and to see the troops in kilts and tartan trews. 
 Having been under restraint for so long the members of our unit had made a day of it and the majority of them came back to camp late and in a drunken condition and full of the jollity that accompanies that condition. 
 Jan 22nd Sat. Had leave from eleven o'clock to-day. Drove out in a "gharry" to the Catacombs and had a look through these wonderful tombs. After paying a visit to the catacombs we took tram to a delightful suburb called San Stefano and there had tea. 
 Lt. Col. Newlands is our new O.C. There are a few new officers attached to our unit. 
 A large number of troopships have arrived in the harbour these last few days. 
 A great deal of more jollity caused to-night by men coming in to camp under the influence of drink. 
 Jan 23rd. Sund.
