  
 28/1/16 The railway is still being pushed forward into the desert and all our baggage was dumped and then loaded on to camels of which we had 90. All tents arrived as soon as we did and camp was erected before dark all being under canvas. Outposts in front, guards in camp. No bugle calls. Our present pioneer sergeant is a M.Sc. of Melbne University and it seems incongruous to see him disposing of excreta &c, but as a N.C.O he is no good for anything else. 
 We are going to be short of water and fuel here like Anzac, everything depends on camel and we are isolated by sand. Our men are good camel drivers already and shout "bis" or make the hissing noise and accompany it with the necessary tapping on the neck in order to get the beasts to kneel. The brutes blow their tongues out like bubbles and froth a lot at the mouth. Groaning and grumbling all the time. I rode my horse today well loaded with feed, wirecutters horseshoes picketing gear &c. Outposts alround tonight under Pedler who fell off his horse today & probably broke a rib. 
 Shifting camp tents &c and getting settled right down here again before dark was good work. All settling down here and we shall be fairly comfortable. Every tent lighted up though no candles were issued being old soldiers the men save all candle ends for future use. This is what makes the packs so heavy; for the comfort afterwards they will cheerfully hump a pack that almost crushes them with its weight. Sleep at 2100.
