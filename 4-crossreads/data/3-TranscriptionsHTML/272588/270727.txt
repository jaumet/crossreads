<p>Monday 24 June<br/>Last night we were sent up to 2nd Battn. R.A.P. at Molenaker in expectation of stunt.  Full moon.  At 12.30 this morning our barrage opened &amp; in conjunction with South Africans on our left, two Companies of 2nd Battn. went over &amp; successfully reached their objective, about three hundred yards.  There were about forty casualties, including four Germans. The Bosch hardly fired a shot behind the front line.<br/>We are now back at Borre again.</p>
<p>Tuesday 25 June<br/>Except for light showers, weather continues fine.  A walk to La Kreule this evening where there are Americans attached, two Sergeants and three Officers.  Already they have introduced base-ball into the Ambulance.  They went up the line this evening visiting posts &amp; the Sergeants are attached now to Borre. Watching a 9.2" battery in action I was half surprised to see the shell soar away into the air.</p>
