  
 was marched to the Railway Station at Rouen with a batch of other fit men, for the purpose of travelling back to the base camp, which was at Etaples. After waiting at the Railway Station for nearly four hours, we were entrained in iron covered trucks which would have been very cold had we not had coal fires upon the centres of the floors. With the coal fires burning and the doors kept closed as much as possible to keep the cold out, we arrived at Etaples with our clothes and faces black with coal dust. 
 Having been in the front line I was not required to do any training at Etaples Camp, but to wait until the next draft of men was ready to be despatched to the front line when I could go with them. 
 I had my teeth attended by the Dentist in the camp and by the time a few days had elapsed, before he had finished, a draft was formed and I was included. I was very pleased that I was going into the front this time, as it was bitterly cold in the camp, and I thought anywhere would be better than staying at Etaples. That the town was very near the edge of the sea, and that there was a very sharp wind, and it was winter, accounts for the fact that the weather was the coldest I had ever experienced in my life. We marched from the camp to the railway station and entrained to Albert. 
 On the way to Albert we passed through lovely cultivation on islands which were formed in the swamp. They used to reach the cultivated islands by means of flat bottomed boats, which, when the farmers returned from their work, were used to convey the products back to the mainland. The products were mainly vegetables and flowers. 
 We arrived in Albert and spent a very cold night in the camp there, as there were icicles hanging in the inside of the tents next morning. From Albert we marched to Ribemont, where we received a mail from our respective quartermasters of our own different companies. I had two mates who were        in my company ("D" Coy) with me, when we were detailed to go on a fatigue party to a village maned Contay. This village was about 12 miles from Ribemont, the village we were in, and we had to march the distance on foot. We had no idea of the nature of the work we were going to, or how long
