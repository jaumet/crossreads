2.  It has not yet ceased raining here To-day.  It is the rainiest day I have ever spent in Blighty.  I have to go out in it but I've got a cape & good boots.  We are still anxious to know the whereabouts of Vic Davies & also Willie Davis.  Cyril Whitehead is on His way back to Australia I think.  Perhaps He will have seen You before this letter reaches You.  I will try & see Bob Lawrence or whatever His name is.  I expect He will go under the name of Waine.  I have noted Your cure for a cold.  I do not smoke at all.  Haven't smoked for some months.  How did You strike Mr & Mrs Brown?  Who did Myrtle marry?  Anyone
