From Ramleh, the road through the Cactus hedges and orchards was like motoring through Eden. The trees (almond) are in full blossom, looking like as if covered by a heavy fail of snow; and the heavily perfumed atmosphere of honey smelling blooms took me back to the boronias that bloom In September in our own dear bush. 
I am to join the first Brigade at Bethlehem tomorrow and will leave Corps at 7 am. Campbell my assistant has developed my plates which are excellent.
