There is no shower - no bath room - We've got a screen rigged up on deck & a bath inside which the men fill with salt water & in you go - All is fixed routine - Chow at 8 - Mine was some tinned whitebait - bread & black currant jam - Bread will be off & biscuit take its place until Cairns is reached - Sick parade at 8.30 - I have one man with a Temp 103.8 - ? Pneumonia - I report - on a printed form - to the Commander by 9 am - Then Quarters - Prayers - then physical drill for the men - To-day they ran from the main deck up 10 steps on to the Anchor deck - round & down - then up & round & so on - This took 15-20 minutes - then came gun drill - big! Guns & the quick firers - Of course live shells are not fired but all is gone thro - The magazines are opened & you see shells going forward & aft - The gunner stands to his gun & his orders come crisp & sharp with monotonous regularity - After 1/2 - 3/4 hour - gun drill is over & everything goes back to its ordained place.
