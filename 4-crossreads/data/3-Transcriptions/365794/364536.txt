<p>Tuesday 15 [14] May 1917 [1918]<br/>Quiet day.  Sat out on roof most of afternoon &amp; the sight of the sea is good indeed.<br/>Down in our harbour here is lying a boat, within their cabins drowned while asleep, an M.O. &amp; some men, hatches were opened by spies &amp; the boat sank.<br/>A balloon up evidently on guard looks so pretty a picture in the clear blue sky &amp; the soft sea air &amp; fleecy clouds are so different to our dry &amp; dusy [dusty] old Cairo.<br/><strike>7.50 p.m.</strike><br/>Surprise for me re H.F. is still worrying as do not know how or what to reply.</p>
