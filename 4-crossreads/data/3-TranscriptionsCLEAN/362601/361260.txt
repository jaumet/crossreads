 Engaged at Walter Watrons. 
 We have a nice time & music. I miss train but arrive at Tiksdale in time for telling of fortune. 
 2 September, Tuesday 
 Go to Town with B & Hanna. I go Home to House of Girl. I nearly knock down on the wharf with Ellis & Etta. We go to flat & lay linos. Terrific thunderstorms & a water sprout off the Heads.
