<p>84 Nov 6th<br/>one is very foolish to settle down because German system is so erratic that one is likely to be shifted with only but a few minutes notice</p>
<p>Nov 7th<br/>I like numerous others did not go to bed at all <strike>stayed</strike> spent most of my time with Leckler &amp; Eva. They all departed at 4 am in a very orderly manner &ndash; most of them assembled in Room 30 &amp; when we sang Auld Lang Syne &ndash; I feel rather depressed at the departure of the majority of the Fliers. Some were exceedingly nice chaps, whilst others were most undesirable chaps, having no idea of discipline.</p>
<p>a special walk for invalids this afternoon. I went, being pushed by Lodge. It was a very pleasant outing; I had quite a lengthy conversation with two German boys aged 12, very intelligent chaps. I was so taken up with them, I asked for their addresses &ndash;</p>
<p>Changed to room 41 with Neame. Recd 3 parcels</p>
<p>November 8th<br/>Few officers arrived last evening, all 3 year old Gefangeners &ndash; I shifted to Room 28 with Cornish &amp; Hill. Room 31 was too much of a boosers room for me &ndash;</p>
<p>Cinema held tonight &ndash; very poor show indeed &ndash;</p>
<p>50 new officers arrived tonight from various camps mostly captains &ndash; Majority of 3 year captivity &ndash;</p>
<p>November 9th<br/>Slept in this mng &ndash; Consulted the RAMC Colonel as regards my foot &ndash; He said I was very foolish to have ever put my foot to the ground &ndash;</p>
