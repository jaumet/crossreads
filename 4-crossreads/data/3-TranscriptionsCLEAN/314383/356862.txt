  
 One could almost imagine that such [indecipherable] a place was a stately cathedral supported on the sides by beautifully carved pillars.  The cliffs  & presicipes are awe inspiring as they seemingly have no bottom.  Sunset was a sight that will never be forgotten.  The colors & shadows thrown on the gray cliffs were simply bewitching. 
 May 3rd Up 5 am. got an early start.  The scenery continues to be magnificent.  One is struck with the non-existence of timber & the barrenness of the mountains.  The valleys are extremely fertile & with spring are a blaze of color.  Wildflowers are growing in great profusion & I am certain 20 varieties could be gathered in any 20 square yards.
