<p>With Dorothy.  I don't like this Hospital, Nowell is at Queen Alexander's Hospital for Officers he has had a small operation nothing serious- he is <u>not</u> going back to Egypt.<br/>Mardi Ritchie is in London but I have not seen her- Laura seemed to think Mardi had not bothered to call on her but Mardi is working hard &amp; Laura is touchy about those things.<br/>What I should like is a car &amp; someone who knows London just to take me about &amp; tell me all about places.  It is lonely on your own.</p>
