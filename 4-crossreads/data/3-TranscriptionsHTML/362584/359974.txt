<p>3<br/>drawers each capable of holding a good deal. Here I have stowed away secretly all my tobacco, cigars, cigarettes &amp; buiscuits. Fourthly &amp; fifthly we have an electric light &amp; fan &amp; sixthly the switches for each, which repose just above my head as I lie in bed. Seventh &amp; last but not least comes an electric bell, which by ringing once brings the steward &amp; twice the stewardess. I have come to the conclusion that the stewardess must be deaf, as I am continually ringing for her without success.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you the name of the ship we are on, but I am not forbidden to state that it has not changed since our embarkation which took place one week ago to-morrow. I am so sorry I cannot tell you the date.</p>
<p>So far we have had a beautiful trip, &amp; though once or twice we thought we were running into a storm the weather has been as calm as possible.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no news, &amp; even if there was I would not be allowed write it, so as I have come to the end of the page &amp; the beginning of the bad writing I had better stop.</p>
<p>With heaps of love</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
<p>Keith</p>
<p>[At side of of page]<br/>P.S. Please give my love to Catherine &amp; tell her that the Irish stew on this ship cannot compare with her's.</p>
