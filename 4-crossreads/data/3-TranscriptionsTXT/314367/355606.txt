 Meals came down to-day to one thing &ndash; Breakfast &ndash; Salmon cakes &ndash; Lunch &ndash; Tinned dog (Fanny Adams they call it -) No Bread &ndash; No fresh meat &ndash; no potatoes. Water distilled &amp; warm &ndash; How'd the average C.T. on the beach like that? &ndash; These chaps never growl &ndash; 'Such a bountiful meal' 'So well cooked' 'Such refreshing water' said Mr Bumpus with a solemn wink to me &ndash; 'Such a nice little craft!!' At 12.30 a function occurred which I don't believe in &amp; the other officers agreed with me &ndash; Two bags of effects belonging to sailors in  AE1  were sold by auction to the sailors of the Fantome &ndash; The sale realized &pound;8/10/- which is a damned robbery &ndash; The proceeds go to the dependants of AE1 &ndash; So far, so good &ndash; but the beach people shd provide for widows &amp; orphans &amp; not the sailors of the fleet &ndash; Men gave 10/- for a damned thing worth 2/ &amp; so on &ndash; They did it out of kindness &amp; charity &amp; out of their very scanty allowance of 2/4 per day &ndash; The sailor men get very little money &ndash; once fitted out they have to provide every new item for themselves wh is just the opposite of the military &ndash; They have women &amp; relatives to provide for &amp; they should not be asked in this indirect way to contribute &ndash; The country  as a whole  should &amp; must provide for the fighting man's widow &amp; children &ndash; Once dead it looks as if you &amp; yours are passed down &amp; out &ndash; For ever &ndash;
