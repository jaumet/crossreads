<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>I suppose you are just about wondering how we are getting along. well we're as right as pie so far, but are clearing for action. last reports &amp; offer for 800 of our picked skins were so unsatisfactory. that we have decided to do a break Our roads will be in different directions this time Chas has a sort of half offer of  a job but will not know for a couple of days if there is anything in it. It will be cattle work on Yetman. I hope he gets on there. he has a fair load to hump about &amp; travelling for graft out here at such a time as this is nothing but a gamble, one might draw a winning ticket first go &amp; you might travel on till your horse nocks up &amp; gets poor &amp; silver all gone. For myself I have mapped out a pretty big order as our friend William has also done. He looked out over the world from Potsdam &amp; then drew the sword which he cannot sheathe without victory or honour &amp; went forth to conquer. he apparently did not look toward the little island where the bulldog lives. Now, I can see as far as England &amp;amp if I have exceptionally good luck I'll get there. there are a few big obstacles in the road, the closest &amp; naturally the largest looking being my big pony.</p>
