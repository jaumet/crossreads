<p>Arrived in Grafton on Home Leave.</p>
<p>Little steam children up at wharf one platform to see last of me.</p>
<p>Saw Ed. of examiner with Rita &amp; went home to tea with her.</p>
<p>Chat with Major Blumer whose son turned out to be wounded in thumb.</p>
<p>Rita played Chopin's [indecipherable] as an only piece &amp; on that account I shall always remember it.</p>
<p>Time too short for such a long parting ahead Good bye to Rita for how long?</p>
