<p>20th<br/>Up very early to look at a captive observation balloon.  At 2 p.m. we went ashore, and had a long weary walk up Shrapnel Gully, with packs on to which we are unaccustomed.  We dug a few temporary dug-outs for ourselves.  All over us bullets were cracking and singing, and now &amp; then shrapnel bursts.  The doubtful honour of having the first casualty of the 6th fell to our troop Bergelin being hit in the eye by a stray bullet.</p>
<p>21st<br/>Busy at work completing our dug-outs.  Colonel Cox wounded slightly in the leg.  Four great Black Jack Johnson shells burst close to us.  They looked awful, but did no damage.</p>
<p>22nd<br/>Was warned to go to Lemnos with Turkish prisoners, but as a G-submarine turned up, we had to wait.</p>
<p>23rd<br/>Went into trenches for 28 days.  Saw with a periscope hundreds of dead Turks lying just outside our trenches.  On observation duty through the night.</p>
