Sunday 7th JulyExtremely quiet.  Received a good mail from Australia, 9 letters latest date being 12th May, just 2 months old which is now the average. Made of weekly drug requisition.
Monday 8thSent off my offsider to collect the drugs & suffered for it.  First he left all the returns behind & managed to break the axle of the car.  Fortunately it happened near the workshops & he was given a lorry to complete the trip.  Weather very changeable, rain & sunshine
Tuesday 9thA very heavy day.  I do all my issuing on this day so all the details come in which means going hard all day.  Got through a lot of stuff.
Thursday 11thVery quiet but on our right our 4th Div. had a couple of minor stunts.  Weather cool & rainy.  The 1st Div at Menin also stunting so papers are free of Australians with a commendation from Clemenceau
