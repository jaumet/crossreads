<p>Signal Squadron<br/>Anzac [Mtd Divy]<br/>Egypt 22/7/17<br/>My dear Judge<br/>A few days ago I was delighted to receive a long letter from you dated 21. 5.17, which had been sent back from England. One from Dorothy of the same date also arrived. I was awfully glad to receive them both. In a previous letter D told me Keith had cabled to say he was "Right as the bank": Knowing Keith I know he would not use that expression if there were anything serious wrong with him but I think he might think himself justified in calling himself right when his convalescence was starting only. That sounds a bit tangled, altogether, but you must sense my English. I am forgetting it in common with other things out here. At any rate I feel satisfied that he is really doing well. You of course know by now the details of his wounds and their progress and I am expecting to hear good news in the next mail that arrives. &ndash; that is if Dorothy has not rendered herself unfit for writing &ndash; I am thinking of that Buick. I hope either you or Mrs Ferguson sit in front the first few times so as to be able to take charge in time to avert accidents. Otherwise I tremble for the physical welfare of the "Wimbledon" family<br/>I must write &amp; give Dorothy a few hints reg motor management.<br/>I did not of course get to Marseilles. &ndash; So did not</p>
