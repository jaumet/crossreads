  
 September 1918. Saturday 21 
 Ahead of Villeret.Bty Post. Weather fine for a change. Jim Colbie went on leave to U.K. on a telegram from U.K. Built a nice little possie splinter proof only. Whilst on line I picked up a Fritzer revolver. Sheedy, Waters, Thomson, Steibel and Armstrong left for Aussie leave - very lucky, Believe I will get mine. Had a lovely time on the lines; Smithy feeling very happy. Had a heap of bombs in gully.
