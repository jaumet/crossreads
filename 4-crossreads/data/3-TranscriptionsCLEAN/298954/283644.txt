It is a comfortable old place  has a fine dance-room, horrible gilt mirrors & a delightful old walled garden on the lake side full of apple & pear trees in full blossom and some well grown old chestnuts.   The sort of place one would imagine as overflowing with cream and feather-beds, that hotel. 
 Fri. 10th. A hell of a row in the early a.m. between the Highly Respectable and Very Drunk. 
 The V.D. came through the "carpet" ordeal with flying colours owing to a little mistake on the part of the H.R.    Swimming commenced today.   The dressing rooms down among the lakeside villas are reserved for us daily from 2.15 p to 3.30 pm.
