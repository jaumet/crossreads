 Arrived safely at Tel-El-Kebir at 8.30 a.m. Mac was O.K. I went straight on duty. It is great to be back at it once more, 5 brigades are here with Artillery & Light horse. 
 Received 6 parcels, had more than I knew what to do with but you may be sure that nothing was wasted. 
 Went & saw Bob Dryden, he is well. 
 Best of all I received 25 letters, I had a gay old time reading them. 
 The Dervish trenches are only 5 minutes walk from the camp where the battle of Tel-El-Kebir was fought in the Egyptian War of 1882.
