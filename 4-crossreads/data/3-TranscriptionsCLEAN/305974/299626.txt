After going to headquarters at Horseferry Rd, we went round to the Aust Comforts funds & obtained information regarding quarters which we eventually got at Victoria League Club off Burke st.  We later went to Victoria, Whitehall Charing X, Trafalgar square. Buckingham palace & Parliament house 
 4 Tuesday Got permits from Works office to take photos of places in London.  We later went to the Strand & Piccadilly.  Traffic here is very brisk.  About 12 noon we caught the bus for Regents Park & the London Zoo, which is an Ideal place & well worth the day of Inspection.  We done a bit of wondering about during the evening.  My word a fellow would never run short of a girl here.  They seem very fond of the Australians. 
 5 Wednesday Today has been quite an eventful day.  We visited Hyde park & Rotten Row during the morning, coming back to Trafalgar square by Motor.  I took snaps of the following place Whitehall, Queens statue, two in Hyde park, Parliament House, & Buckingham Palace. We spent the afternoon going over London & Suburbs in a motor which cost me 12/- being 1/3 of the afternoon. We all had quite an enjoyable time.  I now have quite a good idea of London & surrounds.  We motored home about midnight pretty tired.
