London. Up betimes and by tube to Piccadilly then walked past rear of Whitehall (Guards on parade) to Westminster Abbey and there conducted by verger in all solemnity and installed in a stall in the ancient choir. ? a good old seat and methought how many ancient and worthy persons sat there in its time. A good service with an excellent Te Deum well sung but a long long sermon The Abbey fascinates me with its stateliness and its beauty. I could go again and again just to revel in thoughts of its mighty past and the doings it has seen. Walked round the streets and got well lost and found myself up in Tottenham Road. Then to Wandsworth and saw our people. Peart is dead ? a good and faithful servant. They say I am mentioned in despatches but I have not seen the paper. Found all kit had arrived and sorted over my stuff thoroughly discarding much. Home by taxi item 7/2 due to being an office and it being infra dig to lug burdens about. After tea wrote. In Leicester Square today I saw nurses of rather women in nurses costumes soliciting Hygenic appliances for sale are blazoned everywhere
