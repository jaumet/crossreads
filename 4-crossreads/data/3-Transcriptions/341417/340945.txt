<p>Dear Miss King</p>
<p>Your ever welcome letter dated 17th Feb. to hand and was very pleased to hear from you again. You say you have not heard from me since you received the Xmas cards so I think some of my letters have gone astray. I sent you the cards before we went into the line at Paschendale so that is a long while ago and I wrote several lines since. However I hope you receive this alright and that you are in the best of health as it leaves me at present. We are having a very strenuous at present but you can quite understand why, and we expect to be doing a lot of</p>
