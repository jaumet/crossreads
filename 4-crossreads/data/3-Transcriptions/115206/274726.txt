<p>Battery W.Lines.  near Pont Noyelles<br/>Weather stills hold good, with the clear skies and warm days. Had the usual dip with the boys.<br/>Rode to Daours with despatches and returning called in to see Jack &ndash; he was not  in. Discovered that Sig Coy had packed their kit and partied to Coisy beyond Cardonette.<br/>Had a jolly decent concert during the evening, attended by quite a number of fellows. Major gave us the "Geebung Polo Club," The items were very very decent. Keith Meillon visited . Had my wool shorn off.</p>
