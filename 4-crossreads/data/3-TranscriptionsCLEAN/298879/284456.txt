October 1915Saturday 23Cold Wind blowing still from the North. Batt. had a sham bayonet charge on to some trenches (dug for the purpose) using jam tins filled with cobbles for bombs. We finished up with a few men from each company throwing bombs on trenches with only the fuse & detonators in the jam tins. They did some accurate throwing.
