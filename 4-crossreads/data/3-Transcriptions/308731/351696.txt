<p>My, Dear, old, Dad.</p>
<p>How do you like this.  This is how Mr. Collier teachers us.  If you do'nt know what I will tell you at the end.  It is about the letters Mr. Collier: gives us to do and we have to show them.  I am doing you some Sums.  In stead to some drawing.  Now I think I will tell you about those ,  You can easy see those Commur's in My, Dear, old, Dad?  We are still saving up the money.  I might put a little of drawing after-wards. I do not know when I'll send another post-card to you again.  But I have got such a pretty card what I got from Mrs. Mack down at Cronulla.  The owner of the house it was in a writing pad.  The sums are on the back of the page.  Good-Morn-ing</p>
<p>Much love from you sister Ruth Burrowes. and to your-self.   xxx etc. ooo etc.</p>
