 February 27 192. A day I've enjoyed.  Early left camp, to Bailleul with Eric G., he going on leave to Blighty.  Called in at Town Mayor's Office, and had request for permission to sketch turned down with blatant insults, then to A.P.M's, his minions ridiculed the idea of permission being granted, so wrote short application and asked his damned insulting office boy &ndash; a Tommy &ndash; to hand it in.

Dinner of fried Sole, Eggs and Chips and toast [?].  Back then to Fish Market, and after an hour's further sketching, back to camp, a Bath and a change &ndash; Tea, and with one of the untarred Motormen to Steenwerck for French foot soap, a magnificent drive along quiet roads.  And the evening ended in Rec. Hut, Vin singing and Basil playing. 
 Tomorrow we pack up.

 194. Afterthought &ndash; In the Recreation Hut:  it's the first Rec. Hut we've had in France:  from the R.C. we received at Dranoutre a poor timeless piano.  Here a blind Bailleulean tuned it for us &ndash; now its fine.  A clean warm hut and a great iron stove:  a dozen deck chairs, and half a dozen deck stools, papers and old magazines.  Night, and always it is crowded &ndash; Bridge fours,
