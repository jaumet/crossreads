<p>A big barracouta was caught off the stern of our ship this morning</p>
<p>Saw the "Marathon" &amp; a few more ships go out today.</p>
<p>Went through the usual inspections today &amp; the ship was pronounced clean, at dusk the pilot came aboard &amp; our flag was hauled down, we are leaving at midnight for Port Melbourne.</p>
