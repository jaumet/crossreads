back to her the happy day she spent the same way. I knew it would upset her a bit but I am glad she got home for it. She would be silly to let her job stand between her home. Don't you think she is a brick to work like that while I am away. We have been out of the line for a fortnight spelling but today is our last day. Some of us are going up the line tonight. We have had some pretty hot stunts since I last wrote. The last one being the hottest of the lot. I was hit in four places each off a different shell but they did not even give me a blighty.
