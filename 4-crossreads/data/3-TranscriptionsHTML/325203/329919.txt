<p>AD SUMMUM.</p>
<p>The orbit ends &hellip;. A perfect sphere, to loving<br/>earth divinely giv'n</p>
<p>Until its miracle was wrought, one raindrop<br/>more returns to heav'n,</p>
<p>It seeks its immemorial source beyond the<br/>bourne of mortal years,</p>
<p>Untinged of blood, nor dim with dust, nor<br/>salt with tears.</p>
<p>The spot it blessed, the watered seed, the<br/>living branch, their witness bear;</p>
<p>The blossom by the orchard-side, the ripened<br/>fruit, give promise fair;</p>
<p>And we who breathe that fragrance dear<br/>recall our Edens of the prime</p>
<p>Ere yet we saw the teardrops on the cheeks<br/>of Time.</p>
<p>The raindrop in the wave was merged &ndash;<br/>a wave majestic, tempest-hurled,</p>
<p>High-towering o'er a sea that swept in<br/>surge on surge to cleanse  the world &hellip;</p>
<p>A wave of waves was all but spent &ndash; through<br/>bloody surf it heaved the rest &hellip;<br/>A drop was lost; a bubble broke &ndash;<br/>but - <u>on the crest</u>!</p>
