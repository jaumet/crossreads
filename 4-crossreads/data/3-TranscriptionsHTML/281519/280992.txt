<p>Fricourt <br/>21/12/16 From the other direction came a dribbling straggle of poor exhausted devils from the trenches. A sight that made one's heart bleed. A crucixion of the flesh in real earnest and such as would do some people at home the world of good to see. With pinched faces, thin stubbly beards and mud covered clothes they lurch along wearily, dragging one foot after the other, to their camp. Occasionally one falls and sits down in mud or wet. Some feet some of them have &ndash; one chap was limping along with a sandbag wrapped round a foot from which he had lost the boot. And so we passed hundreds of them all "fed-up" but only wanting a little comfort and hot food to put new life into them. At Mametz we passed a tangled rubbish heap nearly grown over with grass. It bore the sign board "Mametz Church" rather ironic as the ground has been swept by shell fire until it is as bare as a board. Rode through Montauban</p>
