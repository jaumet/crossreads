<p>The steward had been missing lots of little items lately. I saw the soldiers wrapping themselves around these delicacies in the early hours of the morning. Today the soldiers just helped themselves to the stores as usual only they were hospital stores &amp; they would not have been touched had this been known. Anyhow the signaller posted on the bridge for our benefit (?) grabbed the most important of the stores &ndash; a bottle of brandy. He drank it all &amp; must have excited his pugilistic desires for he donned a pair of boxing gloves &amp; toddled up on the bridge to fight the Second Officer against whom he had a grudge.  Luckily, for him, the Chief Officer had just relieved the Second officer so he was turned away without any fuss. He then went below deck &amp; fell asleep in a corner. Colonel Hawley had occasion to call the signaller when a muster was called to see who pinched the stores. Buckling on his sword, &amp; getting ready as we supposed for the battle, he was accompanied by several other officers, down to the signaller. Certainly there was a strong smell of liquor so Colonel Hawley tapped the signaller on the shoulder &amp; as he woke up Colonel Hawley</p>
