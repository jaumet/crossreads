<p>we get shelled, &amp; what with the machine guns, one can hardly imagine, how men get through it. I got through as far as the hindenburg line, or as I should say on the brink, when "Bang" right at my side, &amp; down I went like a wet sock, I then felt to see if my leg was still there, &amp; there it was as large as life, but trembling &amp; throbbing like anything, so I crawled to the nearest shell-hole &amp; layed there for about half an hour, till the bearers arrived, &amp; back I went.<br/>I got carried for miles, from one dressing station to another, &amp; I might tell you that this is the time when stretcher bearers do work.<br/>Well Albert I got wounded on the 3rd &amp; I was, large as life in England on the 5th, so that is some going, isn't it.<br/>I came across the channel from Boulogne, to Dover via Folkestone, in King Albert's Royal Yacht "Peter de Conick" [Hospital Ship, Pieter de Coninck"] which was the first hospital ship to be armed, &amp; she is also painted like a battleship, &amp; she is also fast, doing 27 knots.<br/>Well <strike>Albert</strike> old boy, I might have a chance of getting back to Australia now, but it is a hard thing to say until my wound heals up &amp; the Nurses think it will be two or three months at the least; but I am going to try hard, for I wouldn't like to spend another winter in france, for it is something awful.<br/>I won't you to tell Miss Robertson that I received her Cigarettes the day before the charge, so will you thank</p>
