  Supplement to par: 3 &nbsp; Since capture of &quot;Komet&quot; Mr Whiteman has acted as Paymaster of &quot;Komet&quot; &amp; also as Native Intelligence Officer.&nbsp; Important information re Enemy&#39;s merchant cruisers is in &quot;Komets&quot; log &amp; Colonel Paton with assistance of Mr Whitemen has collected such information. Mr Whiteman has also made a complete list of stores onboard &quot;Komet&quot; &amp; his business knowledge has saved me an immense amount of trouble, my time being fully occupied in navigating the two vessels under my command. 
 Lt: Colonel Paton has taken charge of prisoners; two of &quot;Komets&quot; officers were not onboard &quot;Komet&quot;, but Lt: Colonel Paton has taken steps to secure them. 
 I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, [Sgd]&nbsp; J M Jackson. Lt: Commander R.N. 
 Commanding H.M.A.S. &quot;Komet&quot; and H.M.A.S. &quot;Nusa&quot;
