  
 November 1916 8th   I went out with ten others of the section to start making the light railway near Longueval.  Fritz had been sending his shells over since about 11 a.m. & at about 3 P.M. he began to land them close to where we were working.  Three landed within 50 yds of us & then one burst right in the middle of the small part we were excivating, making a large hole & wounding three of us, McDonald. Buck & Nesby.  Two got "shell shock" & two others got slight scratches.  A camp about a hundred yds. away suffered fairly badly, but no very serious damage was done.
