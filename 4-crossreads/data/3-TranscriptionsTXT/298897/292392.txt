 Ring out old shapes of foul disease, Ring out the narrowing lust of gold, Ring out the thousand wars of old, Ring in the thousand years of peace. 
 Thoughts on a life ended. 
 What I spent, I had! What I saved, I lost! What I gave, I have! 
 Sunday 19th Nov. Had snow yesterday the first of the season &amp; also the first proper fall I had seen.  It was indeed a pretty sight &amp; lasted most of the day rain spoiling it in the afternoon.  It was of course bitterly cold &amp; when the thaw came the mud was as bad as ever.  Cases now coming in by train as roads too bad for cars.  A large number of sick &amp; trench feet cases also coming forward. 
 Monday 20th Nov. A fine day once again.  Went to the German camp for the last time &amp; had a last talk.  Had the "Hymn of Hate" recited to me &amp; translated, it is certainly a powerful poem but of course sadly mistaken.  On my leaving they wished me the best of luck during my visit to the trenches.  On reaching camp again, I heard of a move.  We were to pack up immediately &amp; join up with our own crowd in order to go to the Advanced Dressing Station.  Marched out at 5 P.M. met A &amp; B Sections &amp; continued on to some huts where we slept the night.  Plenty of mud but otherwise fine.
