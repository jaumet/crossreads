<p>For the past few days our bearers have been going back to rejoin unit at Buin in fives &amp;amp. sixes. The last of us leave today per motor ambulance; the 15th F. A. taking over at Longueval. Have a good ride back as far as Meaulte where car breaks down. Finish the rest of journey on foot. 3 miles. Arrive tired but happy to be away from the guns for a while.</p>
