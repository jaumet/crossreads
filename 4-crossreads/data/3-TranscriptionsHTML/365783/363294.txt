<p>(No.4)<br/>Troopship, Kyarra 5th Dec. 1914<br/>Dearest old Mrs,<br/>What a frost the telephone conversation was, still it was good to hear your dear old voice once more even though it was only the faintest whisper. I was sorry not to have heard Margaret but we were cut off apparently just as she got downstairs. One of our officers Capt. Reiach had been speaking to his wife in Sydney just before I got on &amp; he told me that he could hear just as plainly as if his wife were alongside him. I quite envied him his good luck</p>
