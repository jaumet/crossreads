<p>no tidings of the "INDUNA" we returned to the ship and left Moloelab about 5 that afternoon.</p>
<p>We steamed S.W. from there and came up to Jaluit &ndash; the main island in the Marshall Islands &ndash; about 9 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>

They were impeded a good deal by the darkness too, but managed to get safely out the next time.</p>
<p>The "INDUNA" was in Jaluit Harbour, and had been for two weeks, the Germans having captured and kept her there. Berry had to be very careful not to be seen, as it was very probable they would have detained him too had they caught him, and also would have known that another steamer was about somewhere.

Before leaving the ship, Berry had given me full instructions as to how to act should he be captured, and I think the only thing that saved us was, that we were then, as we had been ever since leaving Sydney, sailing with all lights out. Had there been any lights showing at all, we must have been seen by</p>
