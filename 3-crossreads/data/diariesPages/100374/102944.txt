A beautiful Autumn day. Evac to-day by barge.

Sept 24th. 25th. Mon.
Four wounded came in to-day as the result of an explosion of a Fritz bomb in one of their hands whilst examining it.

The chap who had been holding the bomb whilst it was being examined got the worst injuries. He got one of his hands blown off and had a few other serious injuries as well.

One of the other chaps was wounded by fragment of bones from the above chaps hand.

A sight for a Scotchmanâ€™s sore eyes or sore heart to-day. Battalion of Seaforths, Gordons, A & S Highlander and Royal Scots marched past our C.C.S. to the tune of the bagpipes. I recognised a few of the chaps as men I had known at home.
