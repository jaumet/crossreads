<p>together.  I had a letter from Ken yesterday, he seems to be having a good time &amp; is becoming some tennis player, he is expecting to get 8 days leave again soon &amp; is going to Scotland to some people he knows there, he does not say who.  I have been having some very strenous days of late digging etc., the day before yesterday I played a very stiff game of football in the afternoon &amp; were digging trenches as hard as we could go all night with a good ten mile walk there &amp; back</p>
