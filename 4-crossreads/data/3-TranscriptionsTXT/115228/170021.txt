our artillery has absolutely outclassed & outranged "Jacko's" & this has been the chief cause of our many recent successes. Twenty of our aeroplanes bombed the enemy's transports during their retreat today.
Dec.23rd:- Returned from the trenches to our horses back at Richon.
Dec 25th:- Xmas Day. Has been raining spasmodically though at times very heavily during the last two days & nights. Xmas gifts & also many parcels have just arrived, thus we have many good things to eat as well as Richon wine to drink, had it been fine
