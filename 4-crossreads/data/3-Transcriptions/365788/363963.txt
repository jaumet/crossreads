<p>2<br/>enjoying a month's leave in London.<br/>Did you know his mother died in Feby? &amp; poor little Betty's husband is fighting in East Africa. &ndash; Our B. Section moved off today I think for a place about 10 miles from a town with an almost unpronounceable name of 5 letters one of which is a vowel.<br/>We may follow at any time. &ndash; No 2 General is now at Marseilles. Did I wish you many happy returns of 29 Aug ? If not I do so now. &ndash; The clock has been put on an hour so as to agree with the English time, &amp; it does seem so funny to have almost broad day light at 10 P.M. &amp; even later. No news old girl but thought I would write you by this mail.<br/>Much love to you all from<br/>Your ever loving brother<br/>Fred.</p>
<p>P.S. Don't send any more condensed milk dear for though I like it very much it is so heavy &amp; now they are giving us tinned milk<br/>F.J.P.</p>
