April 1917Gaza but had to leave it again.  The 5th & 7th Light Horse had a scrap with the Turkish cavalry & punished them.  They had to leave because the Turks brought up some mountain guns & shelled the horses.  We had only  a few men wounded with bombs & shells.  We saw a great air fight in the afternoon.  4 enemy planes were over us & 2 British.  One of our planes flying very low was suddenly dived on by an enemy plane above.  At the same time the other British plane dived & fired but suddenly plane it broke into smoke & turned over & over like a fluttering piece of paper & fell to the ground.We got back to the wadi at 10 oclock & had a few hours sleep.  We had only 5 hrs sleep the whole time since Sunday night & I don't think any of us before had had such a strenuous time.
Friday 20thThe Turks during the night advanced to the Wadi & our troops drove them back & took a well they had occupied.  Our A Squadron captured 6 horses & inflicted some casualties on them, so also did the armoured cars
