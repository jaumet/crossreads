<p>Sunday 12th Jan '19  Did not have time for breakfast so managed on a cup of coffee &amp; a piece of pastry&amp;met a party at the leave club with a guide to go round the city.  Set off at 9 &amp; kept on the go until 12.  First visited a famous Manneken, a statue erected to a child that was lost.  The father promised a large reward to whoever found him &amp; said he would erect a statue of him in whatever position he was found, he did so &amp; that is what makes it famous.  'Tis the pride of the city &amp; on f&ecirc;tedays the figure is dressed &amp; all kind of rites performed.  Visited the Cathedral, rather fine, but a service being on did not prolong the visit, then to view the Colonne du Congr&eacute;s, a fine column surmounted by one Leopold &amp; marks the time when Belgium became a self governing country.  Then by foot</p>
