<p>a few days ago. Clarry told me all about his holidays and how things were in general. I also had a very nice letter from Mrs Cust saying that she had received a nice letter from you and was so glad of it. No doubt she would reply to it and I am sure that you will see for yourself by her letter that she is a very nice woman. As I will be out for a while I shall be able to write to you every few days, so this note dear mother will only be a short one, Don't forget please to send me along your photo, if you have one, I should also like one of Dad and all the rest, if you have some.</p>
<p>With fondest and best love to all<br/>Your Loving son<br/>Gordon</p>
