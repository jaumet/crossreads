<p>in now for all ambulances and as apparently under it I am going to lose Bernard for there are to be only eleven hacks kept in the whole outfit; I have put my name in for a Base job, as they are asking for long service men for that. I shall be extremely sorry to lose Bernard &amp; all my saddle &amp; things &ndash; the former of which I have had two years &amp; the latter three &amp; a half.</p>
<p>Latterly I have been putting Bernard</p>
