on the "lured", for there is no place in eternity that is more hellish). My enthusiasm keenness, however, to endeavour to record the hideous things men have to endure, urges me on. No monetary considerations or very few others in fact would induce any man to flounder in mud to his knees to try take pictures. The past rains have made the place great slough. One dares not venture off the duckboard or he will surely become bogged, or sink in the quicksand like slime of rain filled shell craters. Add to this frightful walking a harrassing shellfire soaking to the skin, you curse the day that you were induced to put foot on this polluted damned ground. A few bursts of sunlight allowed me to take a few pictures in the trenches of the Broodseinde Ridge.
