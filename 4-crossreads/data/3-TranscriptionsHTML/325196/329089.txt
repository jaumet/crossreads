<p>16-1-16<br/>Sun 16th<br/>This morning the horses were taken off the line 3 horses per man, &amp; the rest of us put up breast lines to picket the horses to &amp; a rough job is was digging holes 4 feet deep in loose sand to put the posts in, but we had the lines ready at dinner time;</p>
<p>This afternoon we were issued witht the same tents that we had at Heliopolis &amp; put them up; The transports &amp; all baggage came by train; We were given our black kits tonight a few of these went astray probably with the 2nd Regt mine amongst them but hope to get it tomorrow; Water pipes have been laid down to troughs close by the horse lines &amp; are very handy these were only completed this afternoon; It looks as though we are in for a dull, quiet time here</p>
