<p>Friday 27 October 1916<br/>Still cold, wet &amp; muddy. Drizzling rain driving in everywhere, &amp; more mud than ever. Hardly possible to do any work during the day, but walked round a good deal mainly for the sake of the exercise. The General came back from division in the afternoon, &amp; 4 of us had to move out of the bell tent into a tarpaulin shelter.</p>
