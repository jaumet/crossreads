  
 there.  Of course you will take the 10 &  all  other expenses attached to the cabling of it out of my account.  I will write to the C. Bank London for Identification Papers & get them to advise me when it reaches there.  I do hope you won't have any trouble in getting through for me, Father dear. I am keeping in splendid health & feeling very fit.  I do hope this finds you well. I must also thank you Mother dear for your very welcome letter to hand recently Mails are eagerly sought after here & I am very seldom disappointed I am thankful to say.  Occasionally one of my letters take a stroll round Egypt, presumably for the good of its health, but it nearly always eventually reaches its right destination. Must close now with love to all at home Your loving son, Leo.
