&amp; I packed my Valice as I was going away at 5 oclock for Edinburgh, I spent the Afternoon chatting with the Daughter of my Hostess who is a very charming Young Lady, well Educated &amp; had Travelled a lot, therefore in exchanging views &amp; experiences I spent an enjoyable Afternoon until 4.30 when I said Good Bye to my Chum who was remaining for a few days more, also my the Hostess &amp; her Daughter &amp; thanking them for their Kindness during my stay, off I went to the Station &amp; was soon aboard the Train &amp; at 5.5 Pm. it steamed away on its journey, passing through Hillside which is the Junction of the Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow lines, we were running quite close to the Sea for a long way &amp; what surprised me was the splendid Soil right close up to the Sea, with Gardens &amp; crops growing splendid, the Scenery along this line was still beautiful &amp; very hilly in places, then we passed through Montrose another Fishing Town of a fair size, then through Arbroath, still hugging the Coast to Dundee, arriving there at 7.10 Pm &amp; only stopped for 5" minutes &amp; off again
