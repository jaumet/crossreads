<p>Friday 11 [10] May 1917 [1918]<br/>Very hot day.  Pts. in ward reduced to 3 thank Heaven, less noise.  M.O. stands at foot of bed, reads chart &ndash; "You are only swinging it now", he remarks with a smile but also my throat now plays up in its way since childhood &amp; is ulcerated.<br/>"Patience", letters, sewing etc. as at Choubra fill in the day.  A very kind note from Matron 27th G.H.</p>
