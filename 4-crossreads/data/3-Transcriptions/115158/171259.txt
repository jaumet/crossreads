<p>on board. On our port beam a light had been noticed and although we had been steaming with all lights out, we thought that we might possibly have been seen. We therefore, altered course &amp; gradually the light disappeared. Of course, it might have been a German torpedo boat. &nbsp;We could have directed our searchlights on the object, but it was deemed advisable not to disclose our wherabouts by using searchlights.</p>

<p>The next morning we arrived outside the harbour of Frederick Wilhelmshafen, and as usual, our steamboats were sent in to sweep the approaches for mines. No mines, however, were found, so &quot;Encounter&quot; was sent in to demand surrender. No opposition was offered &amp; the Governor surrendered, the troops from the &quot;Berrima&quot; being landed. The same evening we left again for Rabaul. The harbour at Frederick Wilhelmshafen is not so good as that of Rabaul. I did not have an opportunity of seeing the town, as it was in the the inner harbour, which we did not enter. I believe it is a very small place. The surrounding country is comparatively low lying and seems uninteresting. During our first night out on our return journey we had another alarm similar to the one the night previous. Lights were sighted on the starboard side, &amp; we went to &quot;Action&quot; stations. It was about 1:30 a.m. Nothing happened, however, so we continued our course to Rabaul, where we arrived on Saturday afternoon.</p>
