My Registered letters Diary Notes posted in Gibraltar may be heavily censored, tell me if you receive them-We will be here still another day- glorious weather so different to England where it rained every day-(The following paragraph is crossed out)Soldiering at home & in [indecipherable] is expensive, on the Desert a man can live on his pay-   I have managed to keep out of debt so far.  The discipline of the New Army does not come up to the Australians & the Officers on board are a pretty scratch lot.Hired a hooded Spanish "Calashe" & drove around "the ROCK"   Gib is only a small place & we have now seen all there is to be seen-"Kept the Time" for a Boxing Match on Board tonight.
