<p>Fine with a few showers during the day. I went down to the dentist in no 16 Camp in the morning &amp; he took a tooth out &amp; made a hell of a mess of my jaw doing it. I did a bit of gun drill in afternoon. Our battery went out on the horses in morning &amp; made a holy show of themselves. About a quarter of them were thrown. Got an Australian mail &amp; letters from Jo, Father M<sup>rs</sup> LLoyd &amp; Linda</p>
