<p>Cavalry at DASKAL had now been verified. The enemy was attacking WADI HESI with particularly strong forces. There was no further information on the situation both sides of the Railway, as well as between BEERSHEBA, JERUSALEM and the Dead Sea since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The reconnaissance activity of the Squadron, corresponding to the number of machines ready to start, was in no way interrupted by the move. The reconnaissance Area, allotted by H.Q., was chiefly, the Area SCHERIA-BEERSHEBA-DEAD SEA, in particular the roads of advance of the enemy on JERUSALEM. Vizfw SPIEL and Lieut. BERTHOLD started. The report of the Lieut. Of the Water-Column of near hostile forces was proved to be completely false.</p>
<p>The Squadron asked for 10 lorries from 301 Squadron to move material but 301 had to hold itself in readiness to move both 301 and 300. The move in the morning of the 8th suffered a delay owing to an air attack of 15 machines, which dropped from 50-60 bombs, damaged 2 machines and made a lorry unserviceable. The men, owing to the numerous and practical dug-outs were unhurt. A direct hit on an Aeroplane tent, tore it completely up, but the machine which was inside was hardly damaged.</p>
<p>The Officers Store was almost completely destroyed. As the bombs interrupted telephonic communication, the report of the long distance reconnaissance in the morning of Lieut. BERTHOLD was dropped near JERUSALEM and forwarded. About 16.30, there were two air attacks of about 25 machines, 120 bombs. Again, no losses in men of the squadron. The losses in material also (I machine destroyed, several light hits, a few tents damaged by splinters) in proportion to the strength of the enemy, was unimportant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, several Turkish Soldiers, encamped near the Aerodrome, suffered severe injuries by Bomb splinters, as well as machine gun bullets. They were bound up by the Squadron Doctor and put into the train, which was stopped for some time in the Station of ARAK EL MANCHALE.</p>
<p>At 1800, an Officer on the Staff of the 8th Army, driving up in a car, gave the Squadron Commander, 'the order to retreat' to read, according to which our line to be taken up an 2300 was about 8 km. North of ARAK EL MANCHIJE near SOMEIL.</p>
<p>In this state of affairs, a complete move was only possible if Railway wagons could be placed at our disposal. The Commander of a Transport Column, who was on his way to Army H.Q. and had to return to TINE, gave up 3 lorries, which we loaded with material and sent back to TINE. A demand made to the Commander of the 20th, Corps on the Station of ARAK EL MANCHIJE was almost without success.</p>
<p>The request that wagons loaded with corn, should be set free for valuable Flying material, was met with the reply, that the Army Group had ordered that it was of the utmost importance to send back provisions. Lieut. BERTHOLD, thereupon, threatened the Military Commissioner that the Squadron would place the Station under fire with machine guns if wagons were not handed over. Without listening to any further contradiction, the Squadron had a corn wagon emptied and loaded with Flying material. The only lorry left, on account of this night loading, went into a trench the axle breaking, and the lorry became unserviceable. As there was nothing else at our disposal, the men had to carry to the Railway heavy material and clothing cases. The departure of the train was held up by seizing the engine until the wagon was loaded.</p>
<p>As the situation meanwhile had become more and more threatening, the Squadron Commander, who by landing in WADI SARAR was convinced that the place was not suitable as an Aerodrome, reconnoitred a new Aerodrome North of RAMLEY, and had a temporary Aerodrome prepared there.</p>
<p>In order to prevent a splitting up of the Squadron EL TINE was made an Assembly place for machines for 9.11. There was s shelter etc. there for machines. WADI SARAR was made the Assembly Point for transport.</p>
