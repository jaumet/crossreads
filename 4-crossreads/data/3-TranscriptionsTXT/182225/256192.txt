 FEB. &nbsp; SUNDAY 6 &nbsp; 1916 
 Fine &amp; hot. Went down to the Spit with M r &nbsp;Lloyd for swim before breakfast. Cleaning up my boots ect after breakfast &nbsp;Linda, Jo &amp; Self went down to Clifton Gardens in car after dinner &amp; had afternoon tea &amp; tea at night there. All the Allisons were there &amp; the M c Masters. Got the 8.25 boat back &amp; nearly missed the train. Linda &amp; Jo got back very late. We had a great day down there and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly &nbsp;Linda &amp; I had a great argument about former loves ect, she has the sounder reasoning, but my arguments are based on sentiment, which in these cases goes a long way.
