  
 I am thinking of sending a birthday cable for yours & Mother's birthdays (3rd & 9th March) & also advising you to address  any   my letters to Australian Base Post Office London.  As my movements are very indefinite I will advise the A.B.P.O. of my address from time to time.  It is possible I may be here for a further 3 months, or again I may be in France in a fortnight's time. It is getting on towards bed-time so must close.  The Ausy mail closes on Tuesday (20th) I believe & I am hoping this will go by that boat. With much love to you all at "Cairnleith," I am, Your loving son, Leo.
