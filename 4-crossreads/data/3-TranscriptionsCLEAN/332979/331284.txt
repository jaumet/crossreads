  
 St Patrick's Day My duty was a lot easier as I only had Six positions to look after & no Men to look after on the Forecastle Head. As the Weather was chilly with a strong wind blowing it was necessary to keep on our Overcoats. Our Course was West Nor West nearly all day. At 6 Pm we were all lined up & when the new Guard arrived & our Men relieved we were marched down on to the Promenade Deck & dismissed & we were not sorry after our Cold & Windy Shift. We have now a Draughts Tournament started it is competed for in 3 classes 1. 2. & 3. I am in the 2nd Class & as there are a Euchre & Cribbage & Bridge Tournament we will have a very busy Week next Week which I trust it is the last of our Voyage, as it is nearly 7 Weeks Since we left Australia, & we are all just about tired of Ship Life.
