<p>Tuesday, 27 April, 1915<br/>Men returned home about 2 p.m and reported that they had a great time at Helouan, they returned from Helouan to Maadi on Monday night making record time under night marching order.  They say that it was six days holiday, every day &amp; night.  They had leave and spent all their money so Helouan business people did well.</p>
