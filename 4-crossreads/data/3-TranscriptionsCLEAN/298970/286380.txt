asked for 6 carpenters to be sent to erect buildings at the Nouve Au Monde Rest Station, at present being carried on by the 15th Fld. Amb.  My name was mentioned by someone, without referring to me first.  Marched to Sailly, (or, to be more precise, Nouve Au Monde) and commenced work.  The first building to be erected measures 99' x 12' of 5 rooms.  In evening walked to Fort Rompu, halting on the way to have a look through a small but new cemetry where numbers of victims killed on 19th July are buried.  Tommies are leaving this locality on their second trip to the Somme and they don't like the idea of it at all.  An operation that has been provided for us to live in while working here.
