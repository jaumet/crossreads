<p>B 33<br/>D Company<br/>Worgret Camp<br/>Wareham<br/>Dorset. Eng.<br/>Sunday 18/2/17.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Since I last wrote on the 7th inst. I have received your letter<strike>s</strike> of 4th Decr.  Thank you very much for the welcome news to hand.  This letter of yours was written from Austinmer, which was the 2nd I have received from you under that heading.<br/>I have just returned from the Sunday night service in the Congregational Church of Wareham.  It is just 4 weeks ago since I came into Camp here, &amp; so far, with a mate of mine here, I have been to this Congregational Church every Sunday evening<br/>The church parade on Sunday morning at 8.30 is compulsory, &amp; the first Sunday morning I was here they marched a draft of 1500 of us to St. Mary's (Church of England) in Wareham.  I simply detest the formal high-church services of the C of E, &amp; I haven't been since.  The following Sunday morning I dodged the parade, &amp; have since been on duty on Sundays till 12 noon <strike>of a Sunday.</strike>  The Congregational church is a fine place seating from 1500 to 2000 with a gallery round 3 sides &amp; a fine pipe organ.  The services are identical with our Methodist ones at home &amp; I am very fond of attending there.  The service this evening</p>
