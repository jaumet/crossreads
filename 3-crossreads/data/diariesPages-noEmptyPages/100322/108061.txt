A wet day. Busied myself about the composition of next draft going away. In the evening went and drank a bottle of wine with the Bertrands.
3/5/19
A fine and pleasant day. The blossom on all the fruit trees is very pretty. Engaged on odd jobs all the morning, held interviews and tried at Orderly Room a handcuffed prisoner. In the afternoon S/C Corney came and showed me an order holding up my demobiliztion. Must get on to this. A lovely mild sunny evening. Met Colonel Davis and after a long talk we went up to Charleroi met some people and put in the rest of the evening drinking port and talking with them at their flat. Food and the War combined with Belgium's bad treatment are favourite topics.
