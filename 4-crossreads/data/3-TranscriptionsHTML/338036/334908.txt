<p>[4th June contd]<br/>the Only Way Aid Post and as not much was doing we slept as we have never done before.  Turning in at 8 pm we awoke at 8.30 next morning feeling OK.</p>
<p>Tuesday 5th [June]<br/>Messines looks very battered and scarcely a thing above ground.  At 6.30 pm "A" Section bearers relieved us &amp; we proceeded Charing Cross.  At 9 pm "B" Section bearers arrived from Billets with instructions for us to go to billets for 24 hrs rest as "hop over" was to take place tomorrow night or by following morning.  Almost immediately we opened a barrage on Fritz with almost every gun and the effect was astounding.</p>
<p>However as Fritz commenced to put some stuff back we pushed off to stalk the 4 or 5 mls to our billets at Pont D'Achilles to make the best of a last few hours before the "hop over".  The journey back tonight was a corker &amp; we could hardly realize that Fritz done so much damage.  Along the road which he had riddled with enormous shell holes (probably 30ft diameter) houses were burning for [indecipherable] mile &amp; shells &amp; the remains of dumps were littered everywhere.  It was a sample of the Hun at his best.</p>
