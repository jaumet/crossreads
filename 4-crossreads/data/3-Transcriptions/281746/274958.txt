<p>Oct. 7th<br/>As we sailed down the harbour towards the narrow entrance we passed an upturned Italian battle ship which owing to an explosion had turned turtle.  A terrific noise of sirens from all the ships as we passed and loud cheering from the people on shore made us wonder what had taken possession of the people.  We had not read the newspapers for days so that we could not account for the immense enthusism of the populace.<br/>One of the sailors on board told us that he had sailed out of this harbour many times with troops aboard but he had never witnessed such a scene amongst the people.  Passing through the narrow entrance of the harbour we anchored in the bay outside.  News came aboard the ship that Germany had asked for an Armistice, but we had all been in the Army long enough to put no faith in rumours.<br/>There is very little reading matter aboard this ship.  The Colonel of the ship is endeavouring to put down gambling.<br/>Put on hospital duty to-night.</p>
