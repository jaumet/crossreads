 Sunday Oct. 22 The Somm Turn out at 6 Had a snack of bread and jam and then 25 of us made away to the trench . B.Sec. as usual lead the way . It was veri cold but was fair good walk as the ground was frozen hard . The bombard never ceas , Gun are bang way day and night . As there were not enough of us to take over the post the 98th came with us , and we had 2 stretcher parti 1 of the 98th and 1 of our at each post . Stan Wright , Billsi May Snowi Atherton , and I went out to the furthest post , up near the trench . We had an old German dugout for our quarter and consid it had gone through such a strenuous time , is in fair good condit . Fritz can certain show us point in make dug-out . This one is about 30 feet deep , with step right down to the bottom and there is room for about 8 men to sit or 3 or 4 to sleep. They are absolut shell proof unless of cours a shell lob right insid . How our chap ever got the hun out is simpli marvel . We were told when we left H.W. that we would be reliev in 4 hour so brought no ration with us not even our water bottl . We never imagin it possibl for anyon to suffer from thirst in this wet countri . All the shell hole are full of water , but we are forbidden to drink it . About 2 p.m. a Reg . S.B. arriv with a note to send out 2 stretcher squad to the R.A.P. near the front trench as the R.S.B 's were all knock out . The Tommi "buck at the idea as their M.D. had given them order not to go into the front , but as we had not been told anyth about it , our parti went along and the Tommi parti came also . What a trip it was ( so call ) trench are onli 3 or 4 ft . high in place and the mud is up to the knee . We flounder along for about an hour . The poor devil of Infantri deserv all the prais for win this war , as they live in regular hell everi minut they put in the trench . The path are veri narrow and it is veri difficult for 2 men to pass . The S.B. who was with us to the R.A.P. said " this last 200 yds is veri hot so when I give the word " follow me for your live " Stan Wright was first , I was next and " Snowi and Billsi came behind . It was a sprint of about 150 yds and we must have cover it in record time . The R.A.P. is an old Hun dugout , 2 stone deep and 3 or 4 room in each storey . A beauti . The M.O. was mighti glad to see us and was surpris to find out that we were Aus" . which of you is freshest ? ask the M.O. We are Whi ? Said S. H. Wright . " Never mind " Whi " said the M.O. I 'm just go to show you . Then he show us our patient . Then he show us our patient . A young guard of an Art . Office about 6 ft . and must have weigh about 13 stone . No wonder the M.O. ask " who was the freshest " Just outsid the dug-out was a big pool of blood and one of the R.S.B 's inform us that a bearer had been blown to piec there last night . So no wonder they were in such a hurri to get away .
