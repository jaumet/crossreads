Railway station & there I entrained for Albert on the Somme river. The journey lasted all day & on arrival at Albert at dusk we were marched to a rest camp where we slept for the night. At Albert on our arrival I heard the bombardment was continued all through the night.

The Front line trenches are about 10 kilometres away from the town of Albert.

On Monday we marched from Albert to Mametz where we joined the 13th Battallion who were in camp there. At this time the 13th Battallion were resting after just finishing an attack. The artillery fire is to be heard very plainly from here the firing line is only 6 kilometres away.

On the railway line quite close to the camp there is a large 15 inch naval gun in action, It is mounted on a railway truck & is used for the purpose of bombarding enemy defences behind their own lines.

I was allotted to No 1 platoon A company when I joined
