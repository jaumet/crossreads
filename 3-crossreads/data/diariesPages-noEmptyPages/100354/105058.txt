Ottawa Camp ? Here the usual camp routine was carried out on Sat 23rd we held our annual Sports at the Gas School.
Monday 25th we left for the trenches (Gender's Gap) to the left of Hill 60, taking over the the 5th Battn on Wednesday 26th.
Our line here is situated on the edge of a shell battered forest. Great activity in the trench mortar line prevails but Fritz seems to have very few guns.
On the night of the 30th Sept after a fierce bombardment with trench mortars shrapnel the 8th Battn raided the enemy line on our front. Killing seven gaining a good deal of information.
On the 8th October we were relieved by the 4th Battn went into Reserve at the Chateau Segarde. For the night we were billeted in a little shell torn chapel on the edge of the grounds. By moonlight the place presented a most beautiful scene. In the centre the little lake surrounded by century old oaks, the whole chateau, battered by shells, looking smart enough in the half light. However we did not stop long here shifting round to a new position in the reserve trenches. Here we remained until Thurs 12th when we returned to Ottawa Camp.
From here we marched to Steenvoorde in France on Saturday 14th crossing the border near Abeele. Sunday saw us en route to Arneke passing as we went the town of Cassel. This is the most beautiful little town for standing as it does on the summit of a hill, it overlooks the green undulating plains which clothed in the dark green yellow of early autumn stretch out in all directions.
On Monday 16th we set out along the road to St Omer, passing Fort Wathen, now practically in ruins, at about mid-day. The fort commands a wonderful stretch of country. For miles it
