 30/10/17 Rome Vendom column at Pari . Bought a ticket for Carmen tonight . After lunch went up to the Quirin hill and had a look at the Quirin palac ? an ordinari build . From here a good view is to be had . From here we drove down to the Bath of Caracalla , a gigant mass of ruin . It is an enorm place of brick and the swim bath and the differ chamber are still clear visibl . The floor and wall were all mosaic , and portion even yet are intact . The arch and high overhang wall cannot fail to impress one . When it was in full repair it must have been a wonder place . There use to be a stadium adjoin . Saw the place where the Rape of the Sabin took place and then set out for the Appian way and the Catacomb of S Calixtus .
