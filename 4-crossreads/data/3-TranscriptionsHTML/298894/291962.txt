<p>Being wounded. These last cases show a lack of proper attention owing to big influx of wounded or some such such cause. We had four amputations one night all of which I attended &amp; gave a hand occasionally. One was prettily finished leg taken off at knee. The knee cap was cut in half &amp; left to grow on end of stump this allowing the loose flesh on knee to be brought round the stump giving it a finish not obtainable in any other way. During this operation I was plentifully splashed from the artery. One evening I went off to the French camp for a night out, but it only resulted in a concert all in French. The artists were first rate however &amp; especially one who sang Carmen was splendid. One general was present &amp; several officers &amp; the men were allowed to "take Off" their officers by means of songs &amp; a kind of cinematograph which reflected figures a few inches in size.</p>
