<p>Field<br/>14 August 1917</p>
<p>My dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>There's no doubt about it, I have all the makings of a real old hatter in me, dije know what my latest passing grievance is>  (I say 'passing' to distinguish between the minor annoyances &amp; the outstanding permanent ones, such as the war itself, the weather, the prevalence of chats &amp; the mail system.)  Well to resume, my latest is I find I'm too popular or fascinating or entertaining or generous or something.  <strike>But</strike> Sounds absurd &amp; very egotistical but my little dug out is never free of visitors.  My very special bosom pals don't come too often (they couldn't) but the sort of comrades, friends, acquaintances, sometimes fellows I hardly know will persist in blowing in &amp; sitting down &amp; yarning.  I am afraid I shall have to firmly bump some out.  I don't know whether they think I have no work or no letters or that I don't like my own company at times.  Its a trying world.</p>
<p>I have been wondering how you are these days.  I haven't written for nigh on a fortnight &amp; I suppose you will be tres fache de moi.  But it is hard to write &amp; there isn't much to write about.  And with all</p>
