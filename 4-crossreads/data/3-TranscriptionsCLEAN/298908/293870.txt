  
 know in an insolent tone what he was laughing at, the chap said I can laugh if I wish to, the Tommy said you had better cut it out or I will have you put out of the building, the chap said no more but let him go, but in a few minutes he burst out again, so the Tommy stopped & invited him up to do the tricks if he was game enough to come forward.  At first the chap would not come but the Tommy felt so sure that he had him in a fix that he practically forced him to come forward on to the stage & show the audience what he could do.  I thought by the way he stepped on to the platform that he knew something about the game but I was never prepared for the shock I got for what with cards pigeons flags bags soldiers ropes cigarettes & heaven only knows what he absolutely dumbfounded the audience & took the performance over himself, he was easily the finest I have ever seen & oh what a shock it was to Mr. Tommy.  Needless to say he vanished.
