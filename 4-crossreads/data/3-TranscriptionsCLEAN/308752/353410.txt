  
 January 26th 1917. A great number of patients passed through our hands so we were kept busy. It was "no bon" turning out at night in the severe cold to carry stretchers. But of course we are much better off tan the fellows in the front line, there they are  out in the open all the time no shelter, it must be terribly cold for the poor chaps. A great number of shells kept coming over our way all day but our good luck continues & all were safe. Of course we have one consolation our batteries always gives Fritz about ten times as much as he gives us. It is a good thing that we all keep so merry & bright, the humour of about 20 men lying cuddled up in a filthy dug-out trying to keep warm, well, it is a funny sight.  Those pictures of Bairnsfather in Fragments of France are really very good & quite true. If we were allowed to have cameras we could take some funny snaps at times. 
 You can form an idea of how cold it is here, as this morning a number of us had to hold our boots over a fire before we could attempt to put them on they were frozen hard.
