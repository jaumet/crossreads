morning and all there was to see was a big burnt, trampled patch of ground with a litter of pieces of wire, screws, nuts, bolts, exploded cartridge cases etc a few of which we secured as souvenirs.We have a big crowd of French workmen in the camp erecting long wooden huts for 800 patients & personnel, but goodness only knows when they will be ready for occupation - probably when the winter is just about over. The change from a tented to a hutted Hospital is costing 12,000.The weather we are having at present is very cold but there is no rain. Frosts are of practically daily occurrence & the water is continually being frozen over.(107)Wed. 13" Dec. 1916 2 p.m..Yesterday we had a light fall of snow. It looked very pretty coming down in little flakes. (108)
