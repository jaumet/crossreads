<p>bound to be plenty of strafing."<br/>20th.   Last night was fine &amp; starry but frightfully cold we shivered nearly all the night for a single blanket is not to warm for the end of Autumn in France.  This morning for breakfast we had plenty of porridge, bacon, tea, &amp; etc.  Captain Jacobs shouted the porridge for the boys.<br/>The boys played up again last night they had been drinking rotten strike me dead rum, it nearly drives them silly especially when taken on top of wine, if I had my way I would settle the drinking question for ever I'll bet.<br/>We started off on our march about 12 oclock, &amp; if we did not have a trouble to get some of the men along well it's a pity, one chap got grabbed in my platoon before we cleared the town</p>
