  
 14.5.15 we are in close proximity to a Royal Marine Light Infantry man.  I found his rifle (loaded) also cartridges in a "dug-out" a few yards away, also his overcoat, stained with blood;  he was apparently shot by a sniper from the hill opposite & I believe a man is lucky if he digs any ground here & does not strike a "stiff-'un".  This morning, when the sun was shining on the hill opposite, we could see scores of dead Turks on the opposite hill & one is hanging in a tree, he had tied himself to a limb for sniping purposes & was shot & still hangs there.  I went into the valley for water this afternoon, & when I returned, shrapnel was chopping leaves off the bushes around us, needless to say I made a scramble for the dug-out.
