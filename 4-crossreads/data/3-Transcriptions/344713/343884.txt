<p>line &amp; we are leap-frogging over the 2nd for the village (What's left of it)<br/>C. &amp; D companies doing the trick.  My Platoon (15) is going from a different part of the line to the rest of D company &amp; we have to get as quickly as possible to some position &amp; dig in before the rest of the company comes up. They have some little affair in a specified trench to fix up. Loaded up with sandbags, picks &amp; shovels.</p>
<p>Sunday 23rd July.</p>
<p>Our "stunt" came off alright &amp; as it was a little after midnight I suppose it will have to be put down to the "credit" of the "sabbath".<br/>The first line was taken easily &amp; the "Fritzs" cleared out of the second. Once out amongst the shells we did not think much of them but the belly crawl out of the sally port with the German machine gun playing on the sides made of sandbags a couple of feet high made us think things.<br/>Once on the road &amp; putting good speed on we felt better.<br/>As we reached the first lot of trenches we were all tangled up in the dark &amp; were once digging in at wrong place (our platoon commander was missing) but someone had a whistle &amp; we were away along the road again.<br/>I finished up with C company &amp; at dawn when we were dug in a bit getting ready for a possible counter-attack went around to own lot on left. Just after that</p>
