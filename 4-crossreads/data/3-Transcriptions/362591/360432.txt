<p>Desert<br/>17-5-16</p>
<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>We are still out in this lovely place, the heat and flies are something ghastly.  I got a small parcel from home yesterday and a bundle of letters which have been to the old Battalion &amp; re-addressed to me here.  I heard yesterday that my old Brigade has been in action.  It made me feel a bit sorry for a while but in another letter I heard that Beiers my old Coy Commdr. had reported back to the Bn. &amp; taken over my old Coy so that set my mind at rest again, and I am quite satisfied anyway that this is a better unit than the old one.  I don't think we shall be long before we get away from this vile country &amp; get into a bit of scrapping again.</p>
<p>The last letter I have from you is dated 2-4-16.  I don't like the last part which mentions the possibility of a crown.  There has been a big flutter in the promotion department lately and several of us have paraded to protest.  I think it will all be straightened out but a crown is not even within sight at present.  The trouble is over seniority.</p>
<p>I managed to get a 1 Company post of my own detached from the Bn. here for about a week &amp; had a good time running the whole</p>
