next morning Saturday 31st when I was ordered to assist another Eng out to E.8. Siding with Ballast. As I only had been previous out as far as the Casualty clearing station during daylight as all my runs had been out at night, anything past there was of interest to me. After coupling up the Eng on the Train we started away slowly. E.8. Siding Branches off at a station called South Loop about 1  miles from here we soon arrived there was turned into the Siding as we were propelling the Train we continued along cautiously we passed the Main Road which was crowded with Troops coming in for a spell Motor Transports who had been up to the Fireing line with stores Material, it is a wonderful sight for anyone to see. Vehicles of every description on the Move a little further on we came to a Gun Loop which contained a 9 Point 2 Howitzer which was amongst some Trees covered over with with Tarpaulin of all colours.
