 Friday, 12 October 1917 
 Had breakfast at Le Mans on Station here &ndash; passed many American Soldiers in trains &ndash; felt hatted &amp; cheerful. Weather very cold now but Joe's leather waist coat keeps me warm. Changed trains &amp; got out of Italian &amp; French carriages. Arrived  CHERBOURG  - had a shave &amp; shampoo, ordered lunch but could not remember the French for DUCK but "quack" "quack" did it. Raining &amp; cold. We cross Channel tonight. Wet thro' as no Cabins or Restaurant on board a Lake Turbine Steamer.
