Saturday 2nd Oct. 1915

Warm weather has prevailed during the last 3 or 4 days, with heavy fogs early morning. Flies are terrific. The evenings are pleasant, calm & quiet, with an unchanging canopy of stars in a violent violet sky.

Warmly congratulated today by [indecipherable] Captain Richmond on my ability as a typist and he said my work was like the skill of an extra [indecipherable]. Rare compliments indeed.

Major Pinwill’s trip to [indecipherable] has been postponed: he leaves tomorrow however.

Major [indecipherable] is off again on Monday on some special "stunt", I believe to Helles.

The Turks have been very active during the last 3 or 4 days with their artillery and their anti aircraft guns especially have caused our machines some anxiety.

The Turks are indefatigable workers: whether they are driven to it at the point of the revolver I do not know: but it is a fact that they can convert a barren position in a night into a nest of trenches and covers. My belief is that they have special "digging" Bns.

Their snipers too are remarkable: they are in every conceivable nook and cranny and it is difficult at times to realise how they live in such positions as they are found. They are a harassing factor in the operations of our fatigue parties by day and night.

Sunday 3rd Oct. 1915

Wrote Mab. letter.

Major Pinwill goes to [indecipherable].

Monday 4th Oct. 1915

Received letters from Mab. (11 Aug.) Grace (7th & 19th Aug.) Gran (18th Aug.). Welcome news. General Godley goes to Mudros to inspect the troops. The Turks broke the ice this morning with a demonstration on Apex about 9 o’clock. Fairly heavy rifle and machine gun fire whilst a few shells burst over our lines. It lasted for about ½ hour. Our fellows report that they did not see a Turk who kept behind their trenches.

Sent Field Service Cards in ack. of above letters.
