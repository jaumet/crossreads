  
 Sunday 10 February 1917 [1918] Quiet day very few dressings in Connaught.  1/2 day & went Pyramids for blow in the tram & how pretty it is along the roadside, bright green fields, black soil where newly ploughed & away in the distance yellow sand hills or palm trees rising out of the plain. Posted photos to Mother & Ida. Printed various scenes & took notes re photography from Cook (Orderly). S. Watson going back to Australia & at her own wish, but I feel very sorry for her with all the bright hopes of 6 months ago dashed, & a wreck as far as a bad cough can make her.  4.30 p.m. tea at Mrs. Horan's & very nice people, then church 6 p.m. & sermon on the Beatitudes.
