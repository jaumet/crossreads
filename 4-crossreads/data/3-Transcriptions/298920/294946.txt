<p>The sea was lighted up all around us with phosphorus, the effect being very beautiful , though rather dangerous for navigation.  No land sighted all day till 4pm when we sighted hills and sand hills, and two hours later the lighthouse at St Francis where the course was again altered to take us up the East coast.  Very heavy sea running all day but as it was on our quarter we were not inconvenienced by it.  About 3pm saw a big boat going in the opposite direction ship great green combers right over her forepart</p>
