<p>30/12/15<br/>Up at 0700 Dr Craig fairly large sick parade. Left at 0900 for route march fighting order meal in haversack. Small parade so left two officers in lines to round up all there and drill them. M.M.L &amp; K.R. will find further grounds for going further. Drilled on open ground in front of Kondia. Very pleasant in the sun. Peasants hard at work ploughing. Civil guard very elaborate in their neat uniforms. All walls loopholed and at every tactical feature on the country there seems to be some trap. Even the general layout of the villages takes a funnel shape to draw a force on and the houses built up hill one above another offer tiers of fire on different levels. No trees here and the hills have a bare sweep at places very rocky and steep.</p>
<p>Returning we did an "attack" against a small rounded hill coming up in fine style and making the lads puff. Marched back into camp at 1600. Rumoured that we will be here another fortnight. Want to get out of this and back to civilisation for a week or two. All our water supply here is obtained from wells the water is pumped into tanks and then purified with chloride of lime. The soakage appears to be considerable and the under side of my waterproof ground sheet is wet every morning.</p>
<p>Shipping quiet in harbour, one torpedo boat destroyer tore out full speed. About 1700 saw a slight aurora borealis. Some of the issue English boots are n. b. good the mens feet are on the ground already and they can't do parades as they ought. We'll use them for stationary fatigue. Bed 2015.</p>
