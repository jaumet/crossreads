 Dear Father 
 I was very glad to hear from you as I had only the smallest not from mother. Besides you always do hit the very news that interests me, I noticed it particularly when I was away. The family would write yards of stuff which in cases was humorous or more or less interesting in a light way, but when I came to analise it for news of home and the doings of people I was interested in, there was rarely anything at all. I think it takes a man to pick the news another man wants to know. 
 The marriage was not a knock out blow to me, for Olly had hinted to me.
