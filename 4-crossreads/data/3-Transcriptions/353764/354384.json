<p>the Proprietor &amp; saw my Photo in same.<br/>We also had good cause to complain of a letter put in the Sydney Evening News, referring to the A.S.C. as Alley Slopers Cavalry &amp; that we had not been near the front, &amp; every one here is feeling very indignant that they should print such a fabrication, anyway there is no one here that will buy an Evening News anymore.</p>
<p>18/1/16<br/>Nothing of much note.  Still no mail &amp; am beginning to give up hope of any.  Company have gone out on a big march &amp; consequently have not much to do.<br/>Aeroplanes are very active but we can only guess why.  Big Battle fought in Mesopotamia ending in a rout of the Turks.  War news generally, very good.</p>
<p>19.1.16 to 31/1/16<br/>X Chasing Turks<br/>Very dull days &amp; nothing whatever to write about.<br/> To-day I received a few letters &amp; felt a wee bit disappointed that there were not more.</p>
