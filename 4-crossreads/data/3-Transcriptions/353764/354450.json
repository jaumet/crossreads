<p>expressed himself as being satisfied with the Turn out.  It was a grand sight to see line after line of Wagons &amp; Horses all pulled up on the Desert.<br/>Tonight I had a rather exciting ride with the Horse that had been alotted to me.  She is a fine big Mare, about 16 hands high &amp; takes some getting into the saddle. However , to night when I got into the saddle she took it into her head to buck &amp; had me all over the place in two [indecipherable].<br/> I managed to stick to her, &amp; galloped up &amp; down the Racecourse a few times which quietened her. After this I rode round through Zeitoun Matarieh &amp; Pont De Koubbeh &amp; am very dissatisfied with her, so I am taking back my old horse to-morrow &amp; will stick to him if possible.</p>
<p>19.4.16 Wednesday<br/>We held our first dismounted 4th  Divisional Train Parade to-day &amp; it was very good to see.  We went through a few movements, were inspected &amp; dismissed</p>
