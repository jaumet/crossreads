  
 wonder that there is not more sickness altho' here, as in Egypt, there is an awful lot of sore eyes, etc. A most pathetic sight is the number of refugees that are still streaming back towards the rear, some families walking & carrying all they possibly can, others more fortunate have a horse & cart, and perhaps a cow or a couple of goats tied on behind, the families of course mostly consist of women & children, all carrying a bundle according to their strength, & some times a real old feeble man or woman, just able to hobble along. The Y.M.C.A. here is funny, it is in a little mud hovel with one door & no windows, & in which one can get a drink of tea and a few biscuits for 3d, of course the main thing sold is tobacco & cigarettes, which I have not started to use yet, tho' every one has assured me that I will certainly do so before I am in the line very long, well, perhaps so, I won't mind if there is any satisfaction to be got out of it.
