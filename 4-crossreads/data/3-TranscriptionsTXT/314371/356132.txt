started firing every gun he could bring to bear to cover a tremendous counter attack.  The air was practically full of flying iron, there was no space between the shells bursting, as soon as one had burst another took its place.At about 5 a.m. it reached its worst & our Coy. was losing one gun after another.  At 5.30 I stood up for a minute to have a look at the position & was just sitting back when a fragment of shell struck my "tin 'at" punched a hole in it & then stuck into my head where it is at present.
Tues. 15thMade my way to Coy. H.Q. & reported to my officer, then went to the dressing Stn., after seeing the Doctor went back to H.Q. & had a drop of whiskey which I was very much in need of.
