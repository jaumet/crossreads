<p>Wednesday 7 August<br/>Found 2 lineman out on line on arrival so turned in about 1 a.m. Up at 8 am. breakfasted etc. Afternoon out on line. Removed faults. Saw Norm Opie &amp; George Suckling.</p>
<p>Plenty of tanks about. Preparations evidently completed, everybody waiting to jump. Detailed to H.A. with Lovekin. Packed and marched to H.A. in record time. (Maintaining armoured cable). Got a cramped position in a little hole &amp; managed a little sleep.</p>
