 November, 1915 Wednesday 17 Unfortunately my Q.M.S. was bombed on the left breast last night &amp; another Sergeant shot in the foot. Sitting in the Trench, above the rattle of rifle fire, one can hear the Beach Master with his MEGAPHONE shouting orders, all night long, shipping is busy if calm enough, &amp; if rough a ghastly sight can be seen, corpses washed up with equipment on etc some only skulls, evidently some of the 1st landing party &ndash; Mules, donkeys, Boats, &amp; wreckage of every description. We have a large steamer filled with sand as a Breakwater but even so, the waves are very cruel, on unprotected Beach.
