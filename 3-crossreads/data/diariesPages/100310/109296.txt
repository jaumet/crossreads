4/9/17 Campagne
Reveille 2.30 a.m.. Marched out in the moonlight to the parade ground and did a dawn attack jumping off about 5 a.m.. It was not well done there being too much talking and noise. Put SM. Edgington under arrest for drunkenness and sent him in under an escort. Returned to billets with band about 8a.m. and then had a little sleep. A lovely day. After lunch company parade and lectures. Went round to B C Coys found some dirty billets. The Hun is putting some heavy shells round here and every night his ?planes are over. Had some good talks with the people from St Omer. The band played tonight at formal mess. attended a lecture by Col Bridges on Wood fighting he droned on for nearly 2 hours to an audience bored quite stiff but atoned a little by giving us a lift back in his car to the Chateau. P.V. Martin was up on an Orderly Room charge tonight and is not looking after himself. A grand chap in the line he is quite a waste out.
