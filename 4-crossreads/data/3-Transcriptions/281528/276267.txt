<p>31/3/18 &ndash; La Basse Ville<br/>landed on No. 6 and wounded two chaps, the others of the post were badly rattled and shocked.  Spoke to them all and cheered them up then walking right down through to Barker's post.  Barker was hit today but carried on duty.  All the Billjims are in good heart and fine spirits.  Called and saw all the different Company Commanders and found all well.  Coming down Ultimo Avenue we had to breathe through our box respirators as the trench was full of gas &amp; irritated the throat &amp; lungs.  A lovely moonlit night as we homed.</p>
