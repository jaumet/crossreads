 Fire Line Franc 16/4/16 Stand to arm 3.45 white frost pitch dark . Went right round and inspect all post , everyon correct . The enemi 's trench becom visibl we carri on at 4.20 am and reduc the post today strength . Turn in again and slept till 7 after write report . After breakfast went round again and had good look at the oppos trench . Sunni morn some stick or plank be move in German trench so put the French mortar on to it at 300 yard rang . The first shot went 400 yard to the right as did the second and third but the next went to the left . One land right in there fire line and sent debri high into the air . At 1000 we were treat to an aerial demonstr the German bombard two of our plane simultan . One flew veri low and tore across at a tremend pace . One shell burst right under it and it seem to commenc to descend but right itself and carri on . There plane fli veri high . Am connect by phone with a batteri some mile or so back and they have to fire a shell at my order ani hour of the day ? the shell to reach here within 30 sec of my issu order . Test at 1000 and shell arriv skim low overhead and burst on enemi line . Along the rear of the trench are cross and grave with such inscript in indel pencil " Two unknown British soldier " or " One of the Worcestor " , some of the grave have been scope out all round and it would not take much rain to wash the bodi out . From Jay Post post right to Wye Farm are scatter grave in among the green grass and at the Farm is a well care for cemeteri with row of neat white cross . Sent two of the batmen up the town to buy stuff for the mess . There are 8 in the mess in my dugout and we run two sit to avoid risk of all be blown out by the one shell . Today is Sunday . Gener Legg through at noon and Brigadi then came along from the other direct . Read in dugout for most of the afternoon and it was so quiet that one would n't have known a war was on . Later on the enemi start shell toward our rear and succeed in set a hous on fire in the direct of Elbow Farm , probabl my 11 12 platoon billet . We have been treat to some fine aerial display today , 6 were up at one time . Our plane veri dare and fli low and hundr of shell were put all round them , fragment fell round our ear here . Taub were over later but fli veri high . Our observ balloon up ? the German also had one up . Float down from a plane we saw a big white object ? perhap it was from a shell and some rang devic . Visit Jay Post at stand to and found all correct , then did the fire line here . Our machin gun at Wye Farm open up after dark one fire too low and danger graze our parapet . Fire brisken up around after stand to arm . Ration and store come up on truck after dark when enemi cannot see the tramlin . Rat run about all over this place and also swim across the stagnant pool of water . They send a littl mail up night ? paper and so on . The fire line here is much more comfort than some of the billet round and certain safer sinc enemi has been shell all hous . At 10 pm heavi fire commenc on our right and continu 10 minut . The air full of flare . German work out in front of us so sent up a parachut flare and turn machin gun on them .
