  
 Using some of it now   &  it is lovely. I shall try   &  scribble a few lines to her next. Suppose it will be weeks before I get my Aust.letters again. Yesterday when I went to Miss Conyers, there were heaps of News Papers of all kinds for me - dating back to last Augt. So I think it is best not to send them to me while I'm travelling around. Heaps from my faithful friends The Osbournes. 
 Do you know how they are? I must write to them this mail   &  ask them not to send any papers for a while. 
 Must stop now. Fondest love   &  kisses to you all. 
 From Yours lovingly Edith
