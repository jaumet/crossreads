 4.5.15 Tue. 4th.  Had another easy day.  A good many of the roads here are lined on either side with mulberry trees, &amp; we had dinner under some of these to-day.  The Sqd. Sig. left the Regt. &amp; we were signalling back to H.Q. from a mile away per Heliograph.  We were under the Mulberry trees, but put most of the time amongst the branches &amp; I had the biggest feed of mulberry I have ever had before.  Returned to Camp early &amp; Conway, Jeffries, &amp; I had a good long run after tea &amp; gave boxing a spell.  There is a rumor out tonight that we are to leave here as infantry.
