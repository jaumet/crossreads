  
 in the night - we will be nearly - if not the last.  Well Mother I have been in some pretty tight corners since this campaign started but his beats all.  Between the devil and the deep blue sea if you like - I'm glad Percy did not come over - We may get off without a shot at us - covered by the gun boats, but we may not. 
 If we get cut up, you wont see this so it wont make any difference. 
 We are packed up, about 15 lbs of clothes 200 rounds of ammunition, a bag of porridge (which we pinched off the transport carts one dark night) - 2 blankets a waterproof overcoat - and all but rifle & ammunition will go - if it gets hot., a kit can be picked up anywhere, but a skin cant. 
 Half our supply of stores has to be thrown away, & I don't think I can take my sniping rifle, that hurts, she's a daisy, she knocked a periscope at 1000 yds today, you can imagine they don't show their heads much.  That's about all Mother - we are sitting in our snipers dug out - where a Turk will be in a day or two (That was on the 16th - they did not leave till the 19th Dec)
