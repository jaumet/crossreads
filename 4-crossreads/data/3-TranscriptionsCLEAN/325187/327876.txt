 Photos Return to Reg today to Hill 70 (hills only in name, really sand dunes.  [Following paragraph is crossed out] Lost my job for a time owing to row with a Yeomanry Brigade Major, tell you all about it someday I said-"The Yeomanry were caught napping" he reported me to Army Head Quarters & General Chauvel sent me back for a while, anyway, as he could do nothing else am afraid I often say too much in these notes. Our Brigade just marched past so covered with dust they were hardly recognizable.  No Tents tonight under the stars again.
