<p>school [indecipherable] in Scotland. Bart Finlay was in the original 17th with Caesar.  He was promoted in the field.</p>
<p>I have seen Cullen, but at present he is at some school or other at Tidworth. Ned Raine has his commission, &amp; should be here, but is away with a picquet at Lark Hill.</p>

<p>I received notification the other day from Horseferry Road that Arthur's effects were forwarded to Australia per the H T Wiltshire on Nov. 11th.  Everything was sent back, as I did not have a chance of getting in to London.</p>

<p>Your loving son, Keith.</p>
<p>P.S.  I received my third warning to proceed to the front today, so something is sure to happen about it this time.</p>
