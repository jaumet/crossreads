 The  blighters   Troops  were made 
 stand &amp; deliver 
 Our bands of blue were 
 known &amp; feared 
 All Britain we have 
 scoured  Scoured   and  cleared 
 At Waterloo &amp; bakerloo 
 we fought the good fight daily 
  While  Though  some of us  for valour  sad to relate  
 were presented at &#39;Old Bailey&#39; 
 So cursed be they who 
 called us curs 
 Who trembles at the 
 name 
 With buttons bright &amp; 
 Clanking spurs 
 Us Anzacs played 
 &nbsp;
