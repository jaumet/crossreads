 March 1915 Monday 15 Had a bath. First one since entering hospital   Rained, Poured through the night. A record for Egypt. Nearly all the troops out on a bivouac. They will enjoy the wet weather I do not think 
 Tuesday 16 Feeling well except for a slight headache in the morning. Appetite coming on well. Very interested watching Artillerymen pull guns up and down a large sand hill for practice. They had some trouble with young horses coming down as they wanted to roll down the hill instead of coming down rationally.
