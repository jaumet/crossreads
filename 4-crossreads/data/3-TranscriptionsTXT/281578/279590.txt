Tuesday 30 July The battalion goes into the line tomorrow. I am one of the nucleus this time (33 1/3 % stop out each time), & as the company supply duties today, I was on guard again. After being inspected, we had that awful walk in full pack down to Bn. Headq'rs. As we won't be coming back to this pozzy, we had to carry all our belongings. Lor' it was a cruel walk, I had full pack, blanket, oilsheet, tin hat & c & c, & it was a very hot day. We got there at 4 p.m., wet with perspiration & very tired, &  I was very glad when the "old guard present arms" rot, was finished, & we took over from the old guard, & got our heavy packs off. The silly part was that Sgt Alton & 6 men who are to go in the line were sent down on guard, & at 9.30 p.m. others came to relieve them, & they had to go all the way back again. It's a grandly managed army there's no doubt. The calamity was that when the new sergeant went to take over the prisoners one was missing. It had to be reported, & Webster the adjutant , came up & went crook & poor old Alton & the two sentries were put under open arrest. As Corporal of the guard. I wasn't responsible for the prisoners[indecipherable]
