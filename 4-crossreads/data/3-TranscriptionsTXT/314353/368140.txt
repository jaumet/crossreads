 [Transcriber's note:  Private Frank Henderson Molony is a stretcher bearer in the 1st Field Ambulance.  This, his fourth diary, commences when he is at Steenvoorde in Belgium, he then goes to Dickebush, on to Renescure, Ecuire, Bois St. Julien and then Quehen, near Boulogne.  As in his previous diaries, he writes of the books he is reading, of the discussions in the billets about books and poems and he writes quite often to London for books he has seen advertised.  He gives graphic descriptions of the countryside and of the villages they visit or pass through.  He writes constantly of the horrors of the war and the wounded he treats.]
