It is cruel to see the state some of the men are in, they have to wade through mud right up to their arm pits, in this awful state they have to stop for it will be several days yet before we are relieved its enough to kill any man, it would not be so bad if we had dry dugouts to go to or had a change of clothing, but no, neither of these are to be had.
