<p>1918.<br/>Tue. 26th Nov.<br/>Came on deck at about 8 am to find the two "prison" ships rounding the Skaw, the town of Skagen, where the "Ingots Mendi" went ashore, being clearly visible.   A vessel blew up on a drifting mine just in front of us last night and we passed two drifting "fills" this morning.</p>
<p>The "Grey North Sea" is quite bare of shipping and towards evening a choppy swell sent the "Ficaria" lurching like a rowing boat.   I was on deck most of the night &ndash; I must frankly admit that mines have got on my nerves.</p>
<p>Wed. 27th<br/>Thick, choppy weather &amp; the shore almost invisible as we entered the Firth of Forth about dusk.   (5 or 6 pm)   We anchored at 8 amid terrific cheering &amp; playing of searchlights from a portion of the "Naivy".</p>
<p>But why do these maniacal Ruhlebenites show their joy and vivacity by singing "Are we down-hearted?   No &ndash; No &ndash; No" to the dirge-like straines of the "Te Deum".</p>
