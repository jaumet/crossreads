We got into touch & were told to proceed to a place called Tel El Sheria[?] which we did. Going along the track there were dead & wounded about & we did what we could. We met a few who had lost touch of their units & were on the same lay[?] as ourselves. After wandering about we decided to camp & our S.M. proceeded to try & get in touch with Headquarters. Failing in this we pushed on & intended to strike Tel El Sheria[?] as quickly as possible. We very nearly met with disaster. Tel El Sheria[?] had not fallen and we would have probably rode into the Turkish lines. This would have meant capture or practically the total destruction
