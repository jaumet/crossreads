 31-5-15.   6.30 a.m.   My letter to M Mary Thomas is just completed.  In case she has difficulty in reading it I have recommended to her that your aid should be obtained for deciphering. 
 This must be ready for post soon, therefore little can be added. 
 The atmosphere in the morning is best in all the day here, but there is a busy morning before me, which allows me but to complete and enclose this in an envelope.  There is much to write about, but in my next for you 'twill be placed if moments will allow.

 Heaps of love &amp; loads of kisses for you from Your loving and afftn father John B Nash
