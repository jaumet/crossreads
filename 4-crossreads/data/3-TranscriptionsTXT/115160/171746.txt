 [Note written on a page of The Anzac Bulletin] 
 This shows you a building after being battered about by shell-fire being used for military purposes by means of sandbags. A very common sight. Sometimes you&#39;ll see a young house of sandbags inside a house that is pretty well &quot;fixed up&quot;
