<p>16<br/>one of the ship's boats &amp; had a very good time. We returned to the Chalet for afternoon tea where we were joined by Lt Monro (1st officer) &amp; Dr Maguire (Military contingent). The Chalet is very pleasantly situated and is surrounded by cocoanut palms. The whole of the interior is lit by acetylene gas. Scattered about outside are a number of smaller buildings making quite a little settlement. It is used as a winter resort by people from the Mainland. Inside the dining room is a melancholy reminder of the recent past. One of the lifebuoys from the ill-fated "Yongala" was picked up near the Island and it now adorns one of the beams of the Chalet. It is marked "In Memoriam, S.S. Yongala". Near the settlement is a small stream bridged with hatch coverings &amp; gratings from other derelicts. Altogether an interesting place. I here tasted for the first time a paw-paw or mope apple. It is somewhat like rock melon in shape but has a more piquant flavour.<br/>In the wardroom tonight we sang some of the good old hymns, not forgetting "Eternal Father, strong to save". We are all hoping to find the "Aorangi" (store ship) anchored near by tomorrow as we will probably be able to go further on our way when she arrives. Of course we do not expect her to bring any mails; not quite! but then she night have some, might she not? We shall see.<br/>Monday 31st : Awoke this morning to find the "Aorangi" anchored on our port bow. She arrived shortly after midnight. How wistfully we looked at her, searching her from bow to stern &amp; from keel to truck for letters.<br/>2.30 pm : Palm Island is a fraud. Yesterday it was Paradise, today ___? 1, 2 &amp; 3 Companies Naval Reserve landed for target practice &amp; it rained the whole time. Then we had to wade out to the boats &amp; sat down</p>
