From No 1340Sgt A.F. Fry10th Reins.13the Battalion
3.3.16Zeitoun Camp
Dear Mother,
Have no time to write a letter now. We are moving out to Ismalia early tomorrow morning, and I am up to my eyes in work, but I did not want to take these photos & negatives away with me, so will post them tonight with this note. I know it's an awful scrawl, but you must excuse it this time. I am quite O.K. and am looking forward to some hard work when we join the Battalion to get into condition again.
Good bye Mother, for the present, and I will write from Ismalia as soon as I get the chance.
Love to all the family
Your son
Alan
