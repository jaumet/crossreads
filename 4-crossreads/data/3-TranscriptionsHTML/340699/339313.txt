<p>the mud - curse the cards!! This place is rotten, but I hear that the place we go to is much worse. I've been debating in my mind whether to apply for 6 months leave or not.

Tho' friendly with the staff, they are all out for themselves and as I have no weight, I cannot demand anything and, at a great disadvantage  must forage for instructions as to time of leaving, transport to and accommodation at our destination. I'm lucky if I get any of these, for they leave me altogether out of their calculations. By the skin of my teeth I scrambled on an already loaded lorry and we bumped away to this place, where I found a "doss" on the floor of a broken down stable. I found that the staff officers had moved</p>
