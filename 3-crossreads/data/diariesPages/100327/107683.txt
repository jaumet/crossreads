Major Smith still in command. C.O. like Achilles keeps to his tent. Bitterly cold before dawn and later a piercing wind from Gulf of Saros combined with a ledden sky makes greatcoats mufflers the rule. Water supply again very scanty and sea roughening up again probably cutting off communication once more. Proposal to make Mitchell bachsheesh Corpl of batmen turned down by me. Fatigues carrying sandbags are my envy today, good warming exercise. This place will be hellish cold in snow time. Proposal mooted for material strengthening of show by a little straight cut. Some reserve work for us then most likely. 
Reply re B?dier C.O. should today come from A.A.G. to settle present condition of affairs which is meantime "dem?d unsatisfactory". Sent ORS Peart down to 23rd endeavouring to elicit some information re Jack, whose long continued silence is causing me some worry. He elicited nothing but the promise to send information up. With Major Smith went up firing line and located our position on Mortar Ridge also picked place for our snipers to sneak out to. Price died poor chap and am anxious to have his death avenged. Smith's brother very broken up took his brother's belongings. The two brothers were on the one post. 
We blew mine up at Russells Top during morning and since then 
bombing and firing have been very vigorous. Very quiet and very cold. Sea said to be fairly calm. Being Sunday Peart went to service at Cook's fires One day is so like another here Sunday is not noticed In fact it is my busy day and I know that Abdul's bullets are just as deadly then as any other day. Talk of an issue (in fact it's approved) of margarine or butter cheese, oxo peasoup vegetable chocolate in lieu of rum. How can they do it when it is impossible to land water even
