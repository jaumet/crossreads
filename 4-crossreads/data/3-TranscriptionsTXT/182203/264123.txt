suddenly Monday night to be ready to depart next day. Had scarcely got over that shock, when Thursday-night Sister-in-charge (Foley) whom we like so much was told that the previous Sister who was in charge & had been on sick leave had returned & was in Doullens. It was an awful surprise to us all, & we were all very sorry., she left the next day. The new one I do not know much, being on night duty, do not see much of her but things are going on smoothly. One wonders if your turn will be next. I hope not. Am very comfy & happy here. Getting spoiled as usual. Last night a tin (that was full of biscuits) of Swallow & Ariels Bis.
