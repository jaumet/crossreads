<p>Well, so much for that, though I'm afraid I can not give you much of an idea of how it looks &amp; what it feels like &ndash; you have to be in it for that.</p>
<p>We had a night march last night. These come along about once a week, and we have our full packs on. Last night we left Camp &amp; marched through Heliopolis &amp; Abbassia &amp; back via Palais de Koubbeh &amp; Zeitoun Station, about 7 or 8 miles altogether. They are good, these marches, because it is nice &amp; cool, and the flies do not trouble us nearly so much as in the day time.</p>
<p>Well, Father this will do for the time being, and if you think anyone else would care to read it, just pass it on.<br/>Much Love to all the family<br/>Your son<br/>Alan</p>
<p>I have not had any letters from home yet, though I got 3 from "other people" last Monday. A mail is due tomorrow. I may have better luck then.</p>
