<p>Sunday, 22 August, 1915<br/>We heard the Turks counter attack on our left flank in the early hrs of the morn, and I believe they regained a trench but it was soon recaptured.  The navy bombarded incessantly and their tremendous shells must have had an effect in our zone things are very quite neither side doing much a big ravine separates both so neither will try to advance as machine guns can mow them down.  We erected some bell tents to-day and they are full already with patients, it is a shame that they should form a rest hospital so near the firing line.  Amongst the Turkish prisoners on the beach is a woman, it is a usual thing for the Turks to take women into the camp with them.  We are now getting bread issued to us.  The cooks are giving us three hot meals a day.</p>
<p>Monday, 23 August, 1915<br/>A brutal day the wind howled &amp; the dust was in clouds, the beach was worse than our gully, it gave every indication of heavy rain, so we made our dug outs as secure as possible when it does rain it will be [indecipherable].  When the advance was made on the left the other day, part of the 5th Bde got cut off and it seemed certain that they would be mowed down or taken prisoners, but they broke through the Turkish lines &amp; regained their anxious mates.  Our men just missed capturing the Turks 75 gun they heard it retreating but they got all the ammunition &amp; some 60,000 rounds of rifle &amp; machine gun ammunition as well as some machine guns &amp; it is all piled on the beach, the transport now is wonderful thanks to the gallant little Indian mules they go night &amp; day where it is even hard to walk.</p>
