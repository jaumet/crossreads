We all do French together too, take it in turns to read a paragraph & then translate it.  Gwen's accent is good & she corrects us & does the general over-seeing.  So you see what a profitable time we are having. Oh I haven't said anything about Freemantle or Perth, but there isn't anything much to say because I was distinctly disappointed in them & we only had a short time in which to look round.  Also it was a broiling day, which under ordinary circumstances would have been tolerable but coming from the cold of the boat trip & arrayed in warm clothes it was rather roasty.  It felt just like coming home to get back on the "Malwa" & I feel as if I wanted to smile at every one of the stewards & just yell at the top of my voice only I preserved my dignity & didn't do either.  Instead I went straight to my cabin to get into something cool & was so delighted to find a wire there from "me daddy."  I wonder did you get mine, I hope so.
