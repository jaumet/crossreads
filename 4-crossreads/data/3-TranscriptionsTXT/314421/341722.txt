English. We moved out about 2. p.m. and passed through Dickebusch and on to Poperinghe where the traffic was so dense that we took about 2 hours in passing through, but I took the opportunity to get a cup of tea, the 2nd since breakfast and some post cards of Ypres.
Darkness was coming on when we got away from the town which is a large one with a magnificent cathedral. Then we passed through several villages and about 8.30 arrived at Eecke, where we halted for the night. On the way from Poperinghe to Eecke enemy aeroplanes came over and dropped bombs. I counted 14 of our search lights searching the sky in quest of them, & I could hear the sound & see the flashes of our guns firing upon the planes.
After we unharnessed & fed up we had a cold tea, with nothing to drink and made our beds in an old smelly french barn.
Tuesday Oct 16. 1917. (1170.)
Cold cloudy & windy.
Revallie 7.30.
We had a good breakfast of fried meat & bacon with bread butter & cheese.
I had a headache this morning which I very seldom have. I attribute it to the dirty musty barn with pigs in the next compartment.
We got under way at 10. a.m. and passed through a number of villages
