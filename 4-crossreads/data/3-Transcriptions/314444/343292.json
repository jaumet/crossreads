<p><strike>as</strike> my little grey home in the South.</p>
<p>The weather now is very changeable; the days are very dull and windy the nights and early mornings very cold, &ndash; at times we get an occasional shower, but I think before long we'll get a good ducking.</p>
<p>Things in general are pretty good, &ndash; I am well, merry &amp; bright. (that's my motto)</p>
<p>It will be ten weeks next Sunday since I landed on this Peninsula, during which time I have had several narrow escapes, but so far have not been hit.</p>
<p>The boys here seem to be in the best of spirits.  To give you an idea of some of the games they get up to, &ndash; I'll mention a little thing that happened a few days ago.  Well our infantry boys threw some bully-beef and some jam over into the turks trenches to see how they would take things, much to their surprise the Turks</p>
