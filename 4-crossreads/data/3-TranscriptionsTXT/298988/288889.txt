Beautiful green fields &amp; hedges all the way along &amp; they looked magnificent it being a nice spring day.

Saw Bow Bells Church, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Commons &amp; Lords &amp; St Paul's Cathedral where the pigeons feed out of your hand.  Also saw the City of Londons only tree, Nelsons Monument in Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace &amp; Cleopatras Needle all the way from Egypt.  Of course also had to go &amp; see Piccadilly &amp; Leicester Square &amp; the Tipperary bar.
