 1916   THURSDAY 3   FEB. 
 Fine & very hot. Had some marching drill in the Riverside park, under Sargent Major Davidson in morning & I had my allotment papers fixed up in afternoon. We went out for a Route march in evening, leaving the Warren about 7.15 pm. We marched all round Marrickville, Dulich Hill ect & got back to camp about 10.15 pm. It was not a bad affair at all. It was the first night for a long time I had not seen Linda & I missed our nightly chat very much as it was the one thing I used to look forward to all day.
