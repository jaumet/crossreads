6th I am sitting in my little dugout it is just exactly 6 oclock, I have been up early getting some parties away I had just sat down to write the instant I took the pen in my hand thousands of guns lashed out as one, words cannot describe what is going on as I write this the air is simply chock full of screaming howling shells everything around is vibrating quivering like a leaf while the noise is indescribable just one perpetual boom, the only thing you can pick out is the sharp bark of the 18 pounders for a lot of them are quite close to us, the view from my dugout is a splendid yet terrible one, we seem to be between 2 walls of fire the flashes of our guns behind the burst of the shells in front, where the line can easily be followed by the orange blue, yellow, pink, green many varieties of red golden flashes from the various explosives used, mingling among this medley of lights are the German flares S.O.S. onion strings which he is madly throwing in the air, for well he
