  
 Saturday, 27 January 1917 [1918] No pass allowed to me as only here 4 months.  Fare 3-16-0.  However I go, come what may.  Off for 1/2 day & the last of the ward for a week. Town 2.30 p.m. shopped, bought camera case 12/6, back 27th 6.30 p.m., waited till 7.40 p.m. for 14th people then picked up by Matron & S. Murphy & officer & flew to R. [Railway] Station in 27 minutes & caught train & so away out of old Cairo once more & free again. Slept fairly well, 3 in carriage.  Dining car on train - very elaborate, food good & well servcd., Pt. 28 or thereabouts. Such lovely moonlight & flat fields with palms showing straight & clear.  My companions are tired out but one cannot wonder, they have packed all day.
