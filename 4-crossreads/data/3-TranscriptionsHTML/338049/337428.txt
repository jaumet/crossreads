<p>Tuesday 6 August<br/>Wet day &ndash; not too auspicious for the big stunt to come off shortly. Preparations marvellous &amp; fast. Quiet evening, but singsong later.</p>
<p>In bed called out to go to [indecipherable] Chateau to maintain line to 11th Bde. (already disc). Left out 11 p.m. arrived 12-30. Road blocked with great traffic including tanks.</p>
