Nina dated 5/5/16. Went out on Column work all round Fletre, Meteren,  Strazzelen, also Rouge Croix.There is great activity in the Motor Ammunition Column. Weather very still quiet.Germans delivered an unsuccessful gas attack. They are now using a far more deadly gas we have all been warned against taking any risk with it at all. All the crops in the villages close to where it was released have turned brown in colour.I fancy that a big attack is going to be launched from La Bassee tonight.Ypres pretty quiet, only occasional Artillery outbursts.

Last night I witnessed a grand fight between aeroplanes. I was sitting down in the Barn  heard loud firing explosions close at hand snatching up my Gas Helmet I ran outside.Up in the air were numerous aeroplanes including Taubes which could be seen high up. The whole course was marked with rings of bursting Shrapnel which looked very nice in the awful grandeur.The finish of the fight was that 4 Germans were dropped 2 British.The bombardment eased down last night except for mine explosions things were comparatively quiet. However
