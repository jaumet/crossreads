<p>July 1918<br/>Thursday 18</p>
<p>Bresle. <br/>Weather showery, with a fair amount of sun. Tom and myself salvaging about three miles of good metallic. As expected we did not go out of action today. The French made a splendid attack on the Soissons and at 10 pm tonight had captured 20,000 Fritzs. <br/>I believe they have advanced 10 kilos on a 45 K front. <br/>Third day made a capture of 400 yds of ground around [indecipherable]</p>
