Monday 29th October 1917
Took Dolly to be inoculated again &amp; arranged to leave Blackpool for LONDON. I do not like this place. Dolly is leaving a lot of stuff packed here in Manchester but has sold her share of Books, Furniture, etc. Rang up her Uncle who is also a trustee, &amp; whom I have not yet met. He lives near Manchester &amp; is a rich man &ndash; in the Cloth trade by name JOHN METHUEN. Got a wire last night, no berths available for Nov. 4th so may be another fortnight in London.
