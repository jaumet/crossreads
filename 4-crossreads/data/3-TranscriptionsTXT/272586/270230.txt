 We had a nice shower of rain here last Sunday about daybreak accompanied with heavy thunder a tree was struck not more than &frac12; a mile away. 
 found a couple of Emu chicks one evening not long ago they were only about 8 inches tall &amp; such pretty chaps striped with grey &amp; dark stripes, they were easy to catch. I was going to bring one home but thought it might die   any way when they grow big they become a pest. a chap at Wallengra had one he also had the pub &amp; store and all the chaps around used to bank their money with him the emu was sometimes called Jacko, but mostly the chicken. 
 now this chap had no need to work for his living for reasons above mentioned so to while away the time he took to sport in the form of Kangaroo hunting. this would lead him many miles from home jacko always accompanied him running with the dogs in great style. it was in front of the pub that the chicken really shone. An emu loves fun of a sort in fact they are very playful. Jacko used to pick the horses on their nosese  a blow something like being hit with a nulla then throw himself on the ground &amp; wave his great legs in the air, making a hideous row. these manoeuvres generally ended with a few smashed bridles, and so the chicken brought much gain to his master. the people rose &amp; remonstrated and the chick had to go he was taken by his owner many miles away to Gragean and after a loving farewell that person returned to Wallengra at top speed a few minutes later the chicken appeared not even out of breath and for his faithfulness had to be shot in the back yard.
