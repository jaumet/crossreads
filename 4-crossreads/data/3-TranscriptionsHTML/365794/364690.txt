<p>Sunday 14 October 1917<br/>Parotyphoid [paratyphoid] inj. 10.30 a.m., only one more &amp; horrid business is over.  No church today &amp; no music.<br/>I hear from the C.H. nurses Lee &amp; Musgrave that they &amp; the other nurses often put flowers on my sister's grave at the C.H.  Blessings on their heads for that.<br/>Today the ocean is like glass and not a "white horse" to be seen.<br/>We hope to be at our destination about 23rd inst.<br/>Funny how the "Ayrshire Blather" ship's weekly paper, shows up little episodes of daily life.  All Platonic friendships, etc., commented upon &amp; S. Finn's Colombo affair with the "Chief" made into a parody on Excelsior &amp; great is the annoyance thereat.  Petty affairs all of them but none the less real at the time.</p>
