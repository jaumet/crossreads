to get through on his lamp when a shell burst got him in the neck and gushing blood from the wound made our Bubs a sick boy. The doctor bandaged him and I let him lie on my pillow until things calmed. A blood stained pillow. He pushed off on foot to hospital supported by 2 men. The Hun attacked well on our right recaptured Villers Breteneux. To allow our counter attack to come off our relief side step here tonight are put off for 24 hours. A quiet day with usual visitors. Went up the line as soon as it was dark and saw Dooley and all the others. L/Cpl. Douglas M.A., L.L.B.
