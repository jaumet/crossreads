<p>The Campaigner</p>
<p>There's a heavy hearted laddie<br/>Weary and worn to-day,<br/>Now in his third year battle<br/>Biding the grim fate's sway.</p>
<p>Two years since the proclamation<br/>When impulse led him through<br/>Conventions hard unto a heart<br/>Discipline never knew.<br/>Only one's heart, and not the world<br/>Know of the drill squad's test,<br/>When youth revolts at harsh commands,<br/>Recruits may know the rest.</p>
<p>An April day the palid dawn<br/>Found heroes all in rank,<br/>Sickly grins hid fluttering hearts<br/>Facing the unknown blank,<br/>Some were maddened by blood's desire,<br/>Scorning the hail of Death<br/>Some remained to succour mates<br/>Watching their final breath.</p>
<p>Strong men recoiled at sight of blood,<br/>And weak turned into strong,<br/>And nerves beat drill &amp; heart beat brawn<br/>When days just crawled along.<br/>Sickness and strain sent many to<br/>A shell free other land.<br/>Some saw it through but only few<br/>Obeyed Retreat's command.</p>
