far brighter when he has tried & failed .
Have been experimenting in telepathy every evening with Vic Hall, with very encouraging results.  I am surprised at what we have achieved as a beginning.  On at least two occasions, a direct thought has been almost fully transmitted when no indication of its nature & not the slightest help was given.
