It was not till tonight at tea rime that I ate a full meal since leaving port, and the enjoyment of eating was exquisite.  Should imagine starving people usually do enjoy a well cooked meal after fasting for a week.  This is our last night in the Southern Ocean, for we round the Leeuwin tonight and enter the Indian ocean tomorrow.  Feeling O.K. again I take the opportunity of surveying my position and really it is not a bad one.  My duties are of the most pleasant, my accommodation if not superb is very good and comfortable, fellow officers
