May 2716 miles.  Food a bit short at village had two meals of chippatti & dripping today.  Bread has long ceased to be our portion & in lieu thereof we go in for the native bread called chippatti which is made of rough flour & water shaped like a pancake only baked.  Our other food is mutton eggs & honey and dried fruits.
May 2818 miles today, had a lot of trouble with the camels, load continually falling off,  a very hard day.
May 29Easy march of 10 miles arrived in camp 10am.  Plenty of food today & good rest.
