Saturday 1 December 1917Dec. 1st & Xmas only 3 wks. off.  Am beginning to wonder if ever I lived in a time when bugles were not being sounded constantly, men marching past to meals, and all the hundred & one rounds of a military hospital.A pt. adm. 2 p.m. (fractured femur) from Aerdrome near here, he went to help start a machine with this result, good as gold of course.  Put up in Thomas' splint, leg shaved (by C. Grant), strapping & bandages, sand bag, cradle, high blocks for foot of bed.All beds now full.Wrote Ida for films, M. Hogg about Dick.S. Foughton diphtheria & sent to Shubra - contacts throats seen, swabbings taken & off duty for 6 hrs.!  Kept quiet re mine.  Little S. Roberts very friendly also Elizabeth Brown.
