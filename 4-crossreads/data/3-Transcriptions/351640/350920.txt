<p>a little stale from over work and the General will probably arrange for me to get away for a couple of weeks.   My regards to Dr fisher and Mr Silk if you have chance to give them.</p>
<p>Good bye my dears. God bless you<br/>[Lines of Xs and Os.]<br/>Tabbie. Joseph. Kitty.</p>
<p>10.7.15.   10.45. p.m.   This morning I sent to you a week end cable message to the following effect:  "Nash Sydney. Tell MacNamara papers posted.   Consult Finney re new solicitor.   Get all papers from Buchanan.  Well."   The first words refer to the giving to you girls power to deal with land matters, it will complete your power of attorney.   The second and third parts refer to the difficulty you have with Mr. buchanan.   He is perhaps becoming too well off, when I took him business first he was in a small way, he then married a good class woman, has been doing well ever since, and with the business of more than one brewery behind him, he and his partner must have been doing well for some years.   I have noted of late that he has been too much at the races.  He may therefore have become tired.  I hope not, but if he is not dealing satisfactorily with you it will be better to change.  Mr Finny will give to you the name of a reliable man with whom to deal.  I do not think that I told you to give the bills into the hands of a solicitor, in this regard they are rather a delusion.</p>
<p>During the week several telegrams have come to me from the Hon. Mr. Meeks making enquiries about his son Victor.  I went to some trouble ament the matter and ultimately discovered that he is supposed to still be at the Dardanelles and unhurt, there was some difficulty about the matter because he was supposed to be in No. 1 G. Hospital.   Two men of the name had been in the hospital, one had also been here but none of them was Victor.   Do you know him?   Mrs Meeks, the See girl is married to a cousin of Victor.</p>
<p>This afternoon a letter came from Mrs. Fraser, written at the Isle of Wight.  She reports all to be well with the Captain and herself.   She desired to be kindly remembered to you girls.</p>
<p>Still very busy with patients coming and going, nearly five hundred of them asleep on the verandahas and other places at this moment, some few seriously sick, but for the most part they are in the convalescing stage.</p>
<p>Under the feeding of Jerom my weight is increasing daily, and I feel first class, it is hard for me to imagine that I am really an old buffer, though it is evident to me that the boys here call me "The Old Man".   What does Kitty think of that?  Naughty boys I hear her remark.   Good.   Yet one must not deny so patent a fact, keeping hope that God will allow me to pull through this game, return home to You, and thereafter to spend some</p>
