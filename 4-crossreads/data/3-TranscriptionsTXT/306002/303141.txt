12.5.15comfortable, several New Zealanders were wounded & a mule killed.  The bullets have been whistling over us but they cannot touch us here.  At one oclock we came along a valley in which a road has been made;  in several places we had to double passing dangerous points & soon arrived handy to the firing line & made ourselves as comfortable as we could on the side of the hill:  one of our boys was shot while going for water.  Twenty odd men a day are sniped off here & the noise of the rifles, machine guns, shrapnel & hand grenades is deafening.  We boiled our quart pots & had tea early & were soon dug into the hill & fell to sleep despite the noise of the firing.  My cold is still bad & cannot get medicine.
