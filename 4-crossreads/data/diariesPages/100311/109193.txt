27/9/17 Dominion Camp
First thing sat as President of a Court Martial on a man of the 2nd. Pioneer Battalion and as he pleaded guilty finished off the case in quick time to everyone's satisfaction I hope. Remained indoors ? lazy or a little unwell.
28/9/17
President of 3 F.G.C.M's today and awarded several sentences of penal servitude to those concerned. After lunch inspected a couple of companies and then decorated 3 chaps with the Military Medal. Attended at Bde.H.Q. at 4p.m. and met Genl. Sir W.R. Birdwood and General Smythe. The former had a good deal to say about things in general. He speaks with no affectation and was a wise choice for handling our force. After mess went round to BdeHQ and spent the evening in consultation with the General getting all the details for our stunt which takes place in a few days from now.
