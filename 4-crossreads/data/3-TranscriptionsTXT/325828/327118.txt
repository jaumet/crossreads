 thought I may be hurled into Eternity, but I can honestly say I was  not  no more afraid than if I had been at home.  Well ultimately we landed.  These people on the drome saw our position, the ambulance rushed out to the spot they calculated we would hit, &amp; awaited results.  As soon as we hit, the propellor went into a thousand pieces, and the machine was smashed to matchwood.  I was in the pilot's seat in front, but my safety belt saved me, &amp; we crawled out with only a couple of scratches &amp; a shaking up between the two of us.  I was granted 3 days leave to get over it, and had a very pleasant time at home with Elsie who also managed to get some time off. I have been flying again since, &amp; had 1 &frac12; hours in the air solo today.  I am pushing forward with various aerial tests I have to do, &amp; hope to have my commission by the end of this month. No letters from home since I last wrote, but I hope no news is good news. We are very comfortable here at present, and the food etc is very decent. Must close now, Father dear, with love to you all at home, Your loving son, Leo.
