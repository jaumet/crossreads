<p>falling into bad habits.</p>
<p>Tuesday 18th June<br/>Fine weather, very few wounded but more sick.  A Fritz brought one of our balloons down towards evening.  He dived out of some clouds &amp; the two observers jumped out with their parachutes but one, through some accident failed to open &amp; he fell like a stone.  The enemy shelled the batteries rather heavily in our neighbourhood also Franvillers, 300 yds up the road &amp; another village a bit further away.  So far he has not shelled our station but we hear them passing overhead quite often.</p>
<p>Wednesday 19th June<br/>Rained during the night &amp; the roof of my dugout proved faulty, result being that my blankets were wet.  Quiet during the day but had a few gas patients in.  Mud in terrible state, the old Somme variety.  Rain at intervals during the day &amp; I repaired our roof &amp; made a mattress to sleep on so hope for a better night.  Mail in today &amp; tells me that Syd has another daughter</p>
