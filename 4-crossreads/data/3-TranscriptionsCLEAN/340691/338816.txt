I'll sing thee songs of ArabyAnd tales of fair CashmereWild tales to cheat thee of a sighOr charm thee to a tearAnd dreams of delight shall on thee [indecipherable]And rainbow visions ariseAnd all my soul shall strive toWake sweet wonder in your thine eyes
Where my caravan has rested.Flowers I leave you on the grassAll the flowers of love & memoryYou will find them when you passYou will understand their messageStoop to kiss them where they lieBut if other lips have loved youShed no tear- and pass them by.
