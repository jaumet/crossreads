<p>making 85 ft in all, to the height of the canal on the other side, into which we entered through another pair of steel gates. (opened) By this time we were 55 ft above the level of the ocean which we had only forsaken a few hours previously. At the Pedro Maguel locks there were another small crowd on shore &ndash; some of the people from Milaflores also motored round and the same greetings exchange of souvenirs etc, as at the previous locks occurred here. the first locks took from 80 to 90 minutes to go through and the Pedro Miguel from 30 to 40 minutes. The idea of the locks being in pairs is to enable two vessels to travel through in opposite directions at the same time thereby saving time and expense. &ndash; The scenery by this time was glorious. We had left the marshy banks and the immediately surroundings behind a mile or so before Milaflores and now had hills of varying heights and color on both sides. Ahead much higher hills loomed against the skyand we almost felt that it would be too wonderful for a big 15,000 ton boat to pass through them. Between these hills, valleys some shaded and some sunny, extended in all directions and these were covered with all kinds of tropical vegetation. The weather was still showery, cloudy and fine intermittently and so the scenery was presented to us in all kinds of lights &ndash; making it more effective.<br/>Shortly after leaving the Pedro Miguel locks we entered the famous Culebra cut. This position is approximately 9 miles in length and represents one of the most wonderful engineering feats of the whole enterprise. The greater portion of this of this section had to be cut through high hills and the average depth of water is 120 ft which is 300 ft at the bottom. The canal at this stage curves in several directions and closely [indecipherable] winding through the valleys between numerous hills. This necessitates the ship to travel slowly thereby giving us full opportunities of having a good look at the various points of interest. Shortly after entering the cut, we passed between conspicuously high hills, half of one of which had been cut clean away, as if with a huge knife. It was a</p>
