Hills 1.<br/>How can one say the feelings these letters bring &ndash; sometimes it seems impossible to bear the awfulness of it &ndash; alone &amp; yet there is of course no one in Egypt or this side of the globe in fact to whom I can utter one word.<br/>Spence still at home in Aust. &amp; if only he will come through Cairo what will it be to see one of my own again.<br/>&frac12; day &amp; went Cairo, shopped then Church 6 p.m. &amp; gained a little comfort in its quiet peace.<br/>Whist drive 8.30 p.m. very enjoyable, A.S. Club, home in garry with Mr. Dowling &amp; Jack Andrew, nice boys both.</p>
