 Sunday 9 January 1916 Had lovely night's sleep in a bed. Left Lyttleton 12 o'clock and arrived here 2 o'clock for picquet duty;  2 hours on and 4 hours off for 24 hours.  Went all round looking for letters from home which should have come last week;  did not find them.  Thunder storm. 
 Monday 10 January 1916 Did picquet duty during night and had leave off till 2 p.m. to make up for it.  Wrote letters.  Had lecture for afternoon parade and then swim.  Aunt Katie and party came out with some tea and I walked to the station with them.  Received 2 letters from home;  1st since I left home.
