Rue Dormoire Lille Post
10/6/16
A short walk through the trenches and reached the destination and had a talk with the O.C. This is a strong post. The buildings have been shattered to pieces. One wall (evidently of a mill) is full of round holes where shells have gone through and burst inside. Evidently a very well built one to stand without collapsing with so many breaches. Returned via Armentieres, called at paper shop and then to Baths. Home for lunch at 1 pm. Busy with orders all the rest of the afternoon. 
Fell in at 7.45 in full marching order having first got all men out and sitting down. Inspected billets ? it is marvellous what stuff turns up in the huts when you clear everyone out. Warned men of the dangers of light and movement c. round the new place. Moved off at 8.15 in platoons in file and made good going until we reached the emergency road. 
Full packs very heavy I made a mistake in not prearranging in such a long march liberal halts. The fellows were passing vivid comments on the "farmy". Guides were to have met us at Rue Marlt but we had to conclude the journey without them owing to their going to the wrong spot. Paraded them all afterwards, being in a hell of rage about it and savage as the devil. I found out that their officers orders were too vague.
Reaching the trenches took over from the 28th, and had a slow job tucking all the men in as the accommodation was cramped. The company we relieved being only 150 strong. All rations had to be manhandled up the communication trench and took a lot of men.
