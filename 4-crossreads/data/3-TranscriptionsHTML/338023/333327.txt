<p>stunt I climbed aboard the Jigger &amp; rocketted down about 1000 yds. of pockmarked slope into a dry water course, then walked abt. five miles for a feed. Since then the sigs. have been swinging the lead sincerely &amp;, beyond an excursion on Saturday night last, nothing doing. The excursion was funny &ndash; we occupied a farm house to get out of a storm, the farmer had an idea we'd come to eat his outfit &ndash; pacified us with Johnnie Walker! Storm lasted until midnight so we also lasted; But the Bacon, cheese, eggs, J.W. etc failed about 11.30 pm. Luckily we had one of the 'Angels' Corps with us &amp; he paid for the lot. Most Aussi's are in need of Angels now! Let me again mention: you must on no account send anything by registered post &ndash; or, in fact, any parcels or papers. We wont get them, so its only waste. I have received  <u>nothing</u>   bar the occasional letters.</p>
