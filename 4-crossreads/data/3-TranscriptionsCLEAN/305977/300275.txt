Several more showers fell during the night.  However, I got in a good sleep.  My oilsheet turned most of the rain & I was too tired to worry about the rest.  We hear to day that Bulgaria has declared against the allies. 
 Saturday 9th The weather is fine & warm again.  A Turk tried to give himself up to the 5th LH this afternoon, but was wounded & couldn't get in.  At dusk under covering fire from our artillery & machine guns a party of the 5th went out & brought him in.  A party of Turks were out on the same mission but the 5th got there first.  A destroyer on the 5th's flank gave the Turks a rough time about 9 pm.  We could hear them yelling.  The Turks sneaked a few shells in on us, but no one was hit
