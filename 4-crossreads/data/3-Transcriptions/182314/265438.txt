<p>Dear John</p>
<p>Since Colonel Holmes was so nice to me I would like him to know that Col. Petherbridge has asked me to stay on and today went further &amp; asked me <s>to</s> if I would like to go south to bring back my wife. Major [Heritage?] has been a [brick?] but I don&#39;t think he cares much for the new regime. Ravenscroft returns to his Company. The [indecipherable] returns tonight with Morrison &amp; Chambers- I believe Martin is on the way in a destroyer&nbsp; E. Coy lost a Sgt in the surf at Litape. I expect to [indecipherable] in February in the [indecipherable] &amp; if you are still in [Sydney?] I will [look?] you up. The [indecipherable] returns [today?] from the island after [indecipherable] trip. Blackett is [full?] of it &amp; says they are [great?] coconuts islands. It looks as if Col. P. is going to let [me have my own?] department after all so I am happy. [Tull?] has [collared?] Col [Winter&#39;s?] house so I am taking Fry&#39;s when he leaves. The [indecipherable] Gov<sup>t.</sup> [Store Keeper?], but so far they haven&#39;t [indecipherable] a Treasurer.</p>
<p>I hope you will have found your little wife well &amp; flourishing &amp; that you are [indecipherable] yourself.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to Colonel [Holmes?] [Indecipherable] to Basil &amp; yourself.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>[Guy V. Manning?]</p>
<p>[Written in left hand side margin:]</p>
<p>I went up the hill at 6 pm on the day you left &amp; the [indecipherable] up 1/2 way up the hill. Tell Basil.</p>
<p>G.M</p>
