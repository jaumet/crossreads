<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother<br/>In haste &ndash; an attack just commencing so I have only a few moments &ndash; mail closing tonight. Father's letter of 28/6/15 and Mother's of 14 &amp; 28/6/15 to hand.<br/>Am keeping very fit so don't worry Mum about my togs etc. Am just wondering whether we are to winter here. Hope not.<br/>Had a letter from Sis yesterday, written 18/7/15, the day after they arrived in Exeter. They were all well and seemed to be well pleased with their new surroundings which is half the battle.<br/>Must stop.<br/>Fondest love to selves and Pat from<br/>Your affectate Son<br/>Terence</p>
