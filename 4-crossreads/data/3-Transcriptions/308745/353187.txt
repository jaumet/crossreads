<p>iron railing with a plain wooden cross inscribed "Captain B.C.A. Pockley. A.A.M.C. Killed in action, 11th September 1914".  The officer commanding Herbertshohe garrison has had some plain cement crosses made &amp; one will be erected in place of the wooden cross.  The railings are embedded in cement beddings.  I saw the grave yesterday.  It is being carefully tended by our men, &amp; has flowers growing on it.

If you would care to have this done, please send me the epitaph you would wish placed on it &amp; I will see to it personally.</p>
