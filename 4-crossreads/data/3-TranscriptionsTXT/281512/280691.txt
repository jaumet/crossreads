25th   1 Am of 26th   When I make this entry - just developed - tired as the devil. Been at it since 8 this morning.   Went to Anzac Heights - had hell of a time in the midst of heavy shelling - Battlefield terribly torn, like a heavy sea - Boche sends "Barrage terrific" on to Inverness Kops & Glencorse Wood - great many casualties.  He evidently anticipates our next stunt & is amassing great reserves & concentrating artillery - on the eve of a great battle - Boche Shells our communication ways all day - smashes up the Menin road - Wagons, dumps & everything ablaze - dugouts smashed in - Wilkins & I nearly blown up by a dump which exploded only 100 yards away - hit with flying wood & mud - Thank God we are unscathed - Gothas come over & bomb. Altogether the hottest affair I have been in - shells bursting everywhere -Battle comes off
