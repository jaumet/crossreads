<p>modern being guarded by forts, and other means of defence, - finding nothing that concerned us, in the harbour or Gulf, we came out again, and lowered and manned our steam cutter, for the purpose of inspecting the islands &amp; riverlets that lay at the mouth of the Gulf of Venezuela &ndash; This vigilant searching party under the command of Lieu Commander Blomfield having sighted nothing, we again proceeded on our cruise and so on</p>
<p>Jan 1st 1915 at 9 AM we arrived and anchored just outside Port Capello Venezuela,- this as far as we could judge, appeared a very pretty place, and to add to its beauty, all the ships and places in and around the harbour were very gaily decorated &ndash; Various officials and Consuls paid a visit to our ship and which was returned by our Captain in due course, and also a salute was fired by us, and returned by the forts &ndash; Weather was exceptionally fine and after theses official ceremonies we again proceeded on our cruise in a N.W. direction</p>
