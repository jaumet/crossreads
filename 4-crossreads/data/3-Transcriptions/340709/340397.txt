<p>We are now (4 pm) rounding Croissilles. But what's this dull ship to me? Awu's not here! He deserted last Saturday and, like the dog that licked up the benzine, has not benzine since. There are plenty of others aboard though, including the young and pretty one, her husband (who has been released again on parole) and the baby. The passenger list totals 17 and we are carrying a mixed cargo for the Mission Stations.<br/>Thurs 17th Pr Albrecht Hafen : We arrived here this morning at 10 o'clock after having called at Mugil, Kronprinz, and Hatzfeldt Hafens. I went ashore at Mugil and inspected the Mission Station and large plantations which, owing to the extreme richness of the soil, are doing remarkably well. Arrowroot is grown largely here and is found to assist greatly the maturing of the cocoanut palms.<br/>11.30 am : Life's worth living again. Awu has just come aboard. After deserting at Alexis he walked up here (between 80 &amp; 90 miles) and joined up again with some other delinquents. I was mightily pleased to see his ugly "chiv" again, though a cold shiver ran down my back as I thought of his knife entering my windpipe. However, I gave him a cigarette and I believe the old scoundrel was glad to see me for he actually smiled. I'll drink his health in liquid quinine tonight. This liquid quinine is the latest thing in fever prevention up here. Some of the men prefer the fever, and honestly nothing could be much worse that the taste of the wretched stuff.</p>
