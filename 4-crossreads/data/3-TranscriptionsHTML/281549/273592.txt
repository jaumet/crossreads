<p>I eventually arrived at Codford Station at 1.30 am on the morning of the 22nd November.  The journey lasted altogether 6 hours.</p>
<p>The Camp is situated about 4 miles from the station on the Main Salisbury Road, so after marching about for two hours &amp; being led astray into the bargain we eventually reached there at somewhere about 4 a.m. The  night was bitterly cold &amp; we were only given two blankets each to sleep in, I was shivering with cold all night and was unable to get to sleep at all. In the morning the ground was covered with a very thick &amp; hard white frost.</p>
<p>Codford is on the outskirts of Salisbury Plains and is about 60 miles from London by Rail.</p>
