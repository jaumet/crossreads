Wednesday 4th Dec.  Intending to go to Glasgow tonight I paid for my room & left my spare gear in the cloak room.  Having settled everything I set off at 11 to go to Bushey Heath for D.W. & for the matinee.  Owing to missing a bus, I was rather late so by the time we reached the theatre the 1st act was over.  However the remaining two were good & very amusing.  It being early for dinner we went to Australia House then to Selfridges where I bought a book & found ourselves at The Regents Palace Hotel for dinner.  We then set off for Bushey Heath but everything went wrong that could with the busses etc & I arrived back too late to catch my train which was unfortunate to say the least.  However I went back to the hotel but could not get a room so after some supper
