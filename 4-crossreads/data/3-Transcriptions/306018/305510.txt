<p>April 1918<br/>altogether<br/>I went to Alex on Saturday afternoon.  Stayed at the Bonnard Hotel &amp; next morning went up to [indecipherable].  It was a beautiful day but I wasnt feeling too good having caught a cold so wasnt able to enjoy my trip a bit.  Had a sleep on the lawn till dinner time.  After dinner went &amp; picked up my VAD &amp; went out for a drive and afternoon tea.  She had to go back to the hospital on duty at 5 oclock so after that I went &amp; had a sleep &amp; caught the 11.30 pm train back to Cairo.  It was a rotten trip.  Wasn't feeling like work on the Monday.  The Doctor put me</p>
