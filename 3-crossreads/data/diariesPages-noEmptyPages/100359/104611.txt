Wednesday 27th
Last night Fritz made an awful din with his whizz-bangs, but did no damage, so we didn't get a call. Tom Mooney is cook today and fed us real well. Got another letter from France today, also some papers. One of the "Whizz Bangs caught a N.F. this morning and gave him a nice "Blighty" wound. He is quite delighted about it. Roy Knowles and I took him in. Most party went into the A.D.S., and got issued with Bose Respirators. Wrote to Aunty Pudney, Nell and Arthur Had an enjoyable game of 500 before we "turned in" 
Thursday 28th
Quiet last night. Slept soundly till about 9 then got up and had some Bacon and fried bread. Nothing much doing all day in the trenches, but very lively in Armentieres. The Hunds put over scores of shells killing a number of people, including a woman and kiddie. Poulton of A. Sect. got knocked with shrapnel whilst standing outside the Y.M.C.A. We carried one man into A.D.S. with trench fever. Things got quite lively after dark. Shells and Trench mortars were banging away in every direction, but did no damage beyond keeping us all awake. 
Friday 29th
Capt. Irving came along and paid us. I got 20 f. so we can keep on "striking matches". Took another Trench fever case in this morning. The corp.in the dressing station tells me that "Trench fever" is like having influenza ten times at once. Yesterday the 26th N.F. went into billets and the 24 N.F. took their place in the trenches. This afternoon 
Fritz put a number of shells in among one of our working parties. They did no damage, and Fritz must have been sorry he spoke, as our guns took a hand in the game and blew his parapets" sky high" Added a few more pages to M.S.'s epistle before I "turned in"
Saturday 30th
Last night I threw away a silver ring whilst emptying a dish of dirty water, and very luckily found it again this morning.
