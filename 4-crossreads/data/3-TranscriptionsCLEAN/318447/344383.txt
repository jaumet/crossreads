I shall very probably remain unless kicked out which is not beyond the bounds of possibility I brought Bernard over with me by bluffing a bit but today to my great sorrow he had to go back to the unit as they are very short of horses & the 1st bgde is moving tomorrow towards Haifa Jerusalem
However before I left I got a couple of photos taken of him But it is sad to lose him after two years and I had grown absurdly
