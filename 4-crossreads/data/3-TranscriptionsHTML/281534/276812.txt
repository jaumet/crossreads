<p>31/1/19 Gourdinne<br/>Ground still snowcovered. Put in the morning in warm room revising the History of the Regiment and selecting for it what photographs we are going to publish. This day expected the General to come over but he has not been near us for a long time. Must go and see him this afternoon. After lunch walked over to Nallines [Nalinnes] and found the General to be out. Called on Colonel James and with him walked over to Haie to 23rd. Bn.H.Q. There fixed up details with Beith for 200 men to come over on Tuesday. Returned to Bde. &amp; arranged to stay on here until mid March. A long dreary walk home in the dark amid powdery snow. A cinema show tonight did not "marche".</p>
