 armed merchantman "Seydlitz" & 2 large colliers, after having sunk "Good Hope" & "Monmouth" off Valparaiso on Nov. 4th., steamed round Cape Horn with the avowed intention of destroying the town of Port Stanley & the wireless station there.  They then intended to leave for German South West Africa.  It was supposed that information was transmitted to the German Admiral Von Spee as to the whereabouts of the wireless station, etc. by a Chilian whaler which had been in Port Stanley for some time, & which had probably been sent by the German authorities.  From time to time this whaler went out to try & meet the German Fleet.  However, before the arrival of the Germans, the fleet under the command of Admiral Sturdee, sent out to destroy Von Spee's squadron by the Admiralty, arrived at Port Stanley to coal & clean  boilers.  Precautions were taken for the defence of the harbour & look-outs were placed on the hills overlooking the approaches to the harbour.  These look-outs were supplied from the local inhabitants.  The English fleet consisted of the battle cruisers "Inflexible" & "Invincible", the cruisers "Cornwall", "Kent", "Glasgow", "Carnarvon", & the battlship "Canopus".  The Chilian whaler was not allowed to leave the harbour.  About 9 a.m. on December 8th. whilst the ships were coaling, one of the look-outs ashore reported 5 ships approaching at a great distance.  These were identified as the German squadron under Von Spee.
