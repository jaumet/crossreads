Posted notes yesterday acknowledging letters from home March 19. Quite cold for a change. We are still having a rough time.
[The following sentence crossed through.]  I am glad JOE saw he is indispensable at home & doing more than his Bit.
I look forward to a reunion some day soon. Enemy plane with black + on wings is soaring above me as I write, & the little rings of bursting shells from our Anti aircraft now all around her but never hit - as far as we know. On Outpost last night & digging Trenches today with Stables, to do it gives little time for the men to cook, delouse themselves or sleep - but men & horses are fit & cheery. Wise not to discuss my DIARY if Military is hearing.
