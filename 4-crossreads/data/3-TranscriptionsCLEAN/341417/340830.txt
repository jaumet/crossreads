  
 Give us fresh horses we have had one good long night's sleep & we are better now than a month ago. The second day we fought in a hot sun on one bottle of brackish water & nothing to eat from mid-day the day before. This on top of 17 days skirmishing is a good performance. I am writing to Mrs Stribley telling her what arrangement is being made re the cash I am holding. Yrs affcty R. A. L. Macdonald 
 [Lieutenant MacDonald was killed in action the following day.]
