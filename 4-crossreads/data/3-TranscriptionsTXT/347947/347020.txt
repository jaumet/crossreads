and in a few days latter I received word from the commonwealth bank notifying me that there was 4-10-0  there at my disposal.  so got a withdrawal from the camp and made out the cheque and cashed it at the canteen.  that was on Thurs 4th May and on the following day Friday left Abbeywood camp for Weymouth camp as Abbeywood camp was being cleared so everyone was moved.  But I may state here before we left Abbeywood we had a great day at the camp on Wed 26th April the day after Anzac day general Birdwood inspected the whole camp he is a fine fellow spoke to every man individually on parade and shook hands with all the cripples who was lined up some with a leg off others with an arm off.  old Birdie is one of the best with the Boys.  so after we left Abbywood camp went to monte Video camp Weymouth stayed there a few days and on the following Monday May 8th we moved to another camp only a mile away called Westham
