<p>stayed in to write to you.  We are meeting Sisters Ross &amp; Weiss in Alexandria this afternoon.  It is simply perfect here, so cool &amp; fresh.</p>
<p>Dorothy brought a few letters for me from The Palace &ndash; one from Fred from the trenches &amp; he is very well &ndash; cannot give any news &ndash; also another from a friend from the front.  A Penzance Paper from Mrs Barrie's sister.  So you see my friends are awfully good to me.</p>
<p>Mr C. is ringing up to-day to see what arrangements I can make to go out with him.  He is fearfully busy, it is a wonderful place, the amount of letters &amp; parcels that go through would astonish you.</p>
<p>My friend (the officer) left this morning for the front.  Oh, it is sad to think such grand boys are going to such a dangerous place.  Hope it will soon end.  Little Eddy's letter was lovely &amp; he has a very good idea of writing &amp; drawing.</p>
<p>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving sister<br/>Edith.</p>
