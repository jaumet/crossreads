anyone, All the villages have a fine big church with high steeple. They are all very much alike, from one place that we spent a couple of days in we could see 4 steeples, or church spires rising above the trees that hide the greater part of each village from sight the french people believe in plenty of shelter, expect for coolness in Summers. Wallnutts, Lymes, Poplars, Elms, and trees of names of which I do not know, yet, The Horse Chestnutts are very pretty trees, I wondered what they were when I saw them first, with their prickly pods on. They grow some good roses here too, we saw several very fine clusters of Crimson Rambler or a rose, very much like it. At present the weather is unsettled and the roads are very muddy, it is only just the surface, but it manages to splash about pretty freely - plenty of heavy gunfire, some where away out in front of us, we hear rumours of victories won, and captures made, Fritz is getting a hot time, I fancy but I will know before long perhaps now I must stop for the present, I may have another chance to write more later much Love to All from your Loving son C.G.P.
