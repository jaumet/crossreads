 
& pools of water are frozen over & in some places thick enough to bear our weight add to the discomfiture a cold wind has started & blowing off the frost & so it makes it hard to put up with. The hardships have now started in earnest it is a question how long one will be able to bear them. My feet are simply Awl amp; I can scarcely put my boots on.

Several Taubes came over today & a party of us narrowly missed being smashed We were standing on the dump when we heard a shell hissing towards us. We dropped down behind a sand bag wall & it just missed the top striking earth a few yards away. We went to the spot & after digging down a couple of feet, got the shell which was a dud. It was a narrow escape, & we were all thankful it missed us.

Big bombardments are taking place daily on this front now and the Belgian people cannot understand it after the comparative quietness for so long. They say Canadians no bombard when they here, why Australian?

I have made a bag of my bed by sewing a covering of bags over my blankets & although very rough it keeps me warm of a night. I received a mail of newspapers but no letters & am wondering where my mail has got to lately
