<p>May 20 Jolly good open air Concert in the grounds. Rather a decent Hosp this, &amp; the grounds are A1, &amp; of course the Nurses. You bet.</p>
<p>21 And at 2 am today the clocks were put forward one hour &amp; this morning we got up an hour earlier. Lord is it any wonder that I felt sleepy. Gee! Last night at 8 oclock was real daylight (or twilight) &amp; 8 is our bedtime, so whats it going to be tonight. The sun will be shining im thinking.<br/>Feeling A1 after a shave &amp; a brush up. Went to Church (Non Con) &amp; meanwhile the Sister was looking all over the place for me. Big crowd of visitors in today. Rather warm in the Sun. Struck a couple of our chaps &amp; we were yarning together when a lady took our photo &amp; promised to send the result along later. Not a bad Hosp, no men orderlies &amp; good nurses. In fact its better than being in France.<br/>[in margin] Sunday</p>
