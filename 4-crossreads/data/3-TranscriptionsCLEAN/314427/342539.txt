There was a fire alarm this morning at 10.30 when all hands had to stand by the boats with life belts on. I was at the church Parade this morning at 11.pm.
[Shorthand transcribed as follows]  The Padre's text was, now I see through a glass darkly then I will know as I am known.  [end of shorthand]
Our course for the 24 hours ending at noon yesterday was 320 miles.
Monday April 4.1919   155Today  is much cooler. There is a fresh head wind and the sky is cloudy.I slept on deck again. This is the fourteenth day on the voyage. It is getting rather monotonous with nothing but water to look at.  Sea water everywhere.  We have not the flocks of sea birds that usually accompany ships at sea. Coming over on the Persic there was a flock of gulls all the way from Melbourne to Plymouth.  I spend most of my time on deck either reading or playing cards.  I only go below for meals or to do some writing.  I have done a lot of writing lately and also a good deal of shorthand practice in writing and reading while on the ship it improves my knowledge of the subject.
Tonight is much cooler. There was a boxing contest on tonight.
