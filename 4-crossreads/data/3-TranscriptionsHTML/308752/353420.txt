<p>material was lying about which was left behind by Fritz, it looks as though he is in a bad way. We were all cautioned about picking up souvenirs, the enemy has set all kinds of traps.  I have been told of a German helmet that was found with a couple of bombs under it, luckily they did not go off when the helmet was removed. What was Fritz front line two days ago was only about 500 yards from our dug-out &amp; not hearing any straffing. The advance made here by the Australians is glorious. The infantry etc., after having a very trying time in this severe winter, at last were too good for Fritz. On our way this afternoon I came across Lieut. Mountford, he was a school teacher of mine at Neutral Bay.  It must be about 12 years since I saw him last.</p>

<p>Received orders to move on again passed through a village, which was just a mass of ruins, it is no wonder the Germans had to evacuate here, it must have been perfect hell</p>
