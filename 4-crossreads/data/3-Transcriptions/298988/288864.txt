<p>started firing broadsides ashore, whilst the Troops over there also became very active.  Shrapnel is bursting all around the hills &amp; the big shells from the ships are tearing up the ground at the same time, whilst the noise is just terrific.  A Turkish village behind the hills is also burning &amp; huge clouds of smoke are rising high in the air.  I got a photograph of this with 3 Men 'o 'War firing &amp; Gaba Tepe demolished fort just ahead of them.  There is also an Aeroplane circling over.  They are still going strong, so I must go &amp; have another look.</p>
<p>5.30 p.m.  A steam pinnace just went past us with 5 wounded soldiers in, on their way to the hospital ship.  The Galeka, Lutzow, &amp; Derfflinger are now auxillary hospital ships &amp; there appears to be wounded going to them all day.  Had a look through a telescope at our boys in the trenches this afternoon &amp; could see them quite plainly lying down.  There are two rows of our Trenches visible, whilst horses are tethered just behind them in a cleft in the hill.  Could also see other soldiers, taking tea up to those in the trenches, up along a small road they have made from the base.  I saw our artillery advance about 50 yards from their positions &amp; open fire.  It is a sight that has to be seen to be realised.  The Turkish village of Maidos is still burning &amp; shows out great in the darkness.  Have been told that our men are going to make an attack tonight &amp; expect to advance considerably.</p>
<p>10 p.m.  Can now hear the rifles going for all they are worth &amp; it sounds like a million</p>
