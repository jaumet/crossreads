<p>Although the island is rocky &amp; barren, there are green patches here &amp;  there, &amp; the valley in which the township is chief situate, presents a perfect little picture of fertility &amp; neatness. The end of the valley is closed up by a stone wall which keeps the sea back from its lowest levels, &amp; then as far as we could see, the buildings filled up the valley course. The town altogether was quite a miniature affair however with a church tower in the foreground &amp; a few buildings, which looked like barracks, standing out in the background. Fine green trees of various shades were intermingled with the buildings &amp; the whole presented the picture of an old-fashioned English villa, - if I may compare it with something which I have never seen.
