<p>5-7-16<br/>Wed 5th<br/>Nothing of any consequence happened today &amp; there appears to be a good gathering at the YMCA tonight by the noise  the lads are kicking up singing hymns &amp; I am busy writing to Edie T.</p>
<p>6-7-16<br/>Thurs 6th<br/>While doing stables this morning Sig Law called me to say the line was disconnected &amp; I started off to fix it, but as the wires were all tangled up &amp; there was loose ends everywhere where our line was broke I could not locate the right one &amp; arrived back late for breakfast after putting a T onto the 3rd L.H. line<br/>I had just finished breakfast when a Taube was sighted &amp; we had orders to file out, I saddled up &amp; took a phone (out of order) to Brigade</p>
