distribution has been somewhat erratic. One of the Regts the 3rd got 70 cases of Comforts for five hundred men, the Ambulance got 3 cases for 130 men. Doubtless the somnambulistic nature of our Q.M.'s were responsible for this. It is still very cold, with occasional rain, but much more pleasant here on the sand than in the mud. The latest "furfies" is that in 2 months we will all be on our way home, the War being over. All these wild reports, are invariably founded on the very best and most unimpeachable authority. "The message just came over the wireless from G.H.Q." or "I was talking to an Officer from D.H.Q. and he told me in confidence etc". One could fill a volume with "furfies" of all descriptions without any difficulty It might prove rather amusing too.
My Brother
1
Of noble clay not from an empty boast
Of proud ancestral strains
Ran traits he had of noble worth
Than blue blood in his veins
A courage unexcelled, a heart of Gold
A life unsullied pure and undefiled
His spirit knew no fear, in danger, bold
He looked Death in the eye, and smiled
A high courageous smile, and in that Hell
That dreadful war let loose, a Hun fell
2
Of noble clay, yea, let the great guns sound
His lone funereal dirges
And while around, their deep roar rends
The heaven and surge on surge
The tide of Battle sweeps from where he lies
Splendid with all the grandeur of the dead
