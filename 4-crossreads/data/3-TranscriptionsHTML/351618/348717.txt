<p>Friday 24th Dec<br/>To-day we shifted our Baggage etc round to Sarpi Pier. It was a long journey &amp; we had 2 wagons &amp; I understand we are to go on to a Transport at any moment. We made another covering to sleep in with baggage all around us. I was still a little off color but I was getting better each day. I omitted to mention I had to go to The Hospital here to see what was wrong a few days ago. It was Xmas Eve &amp; a quiet one. On the Harbour in the distance we could hear carol singing but it hardly cheered me.</p>
<p>Saturday 25th Dec<br/>To-day was warmer &amp; an ideal Xmas Day. I was indisposed &amp; cold not look at dinner, cooked in the evening. I went up to see Dr McCardle &amp; got a prescription.</p>
