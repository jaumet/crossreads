 Your French is quite intelligible.  I am surprised at the mosquitos going "pour votre jambs.  Ils sont mechantes".  Compris?  My French is rather awful but I can make myself understood & understand them when they speak slowly & good French.  There is  at  a deal of patois about. 
 I can read the newspaper fairly well but haven't tackled a French Book yet.  Not even Le Rive or "La Vie Parisienne".  I had a walk today in a wood where a lot of heavy fighting was done not so long ago & really it is marvellous to think of our chaps taking it. 
 The work those Germans put into the defences is really wonderful. 
 Glad you had a good time in Sydney.  I think I am quite jealous of the Colonel whoever he is.  Also the Chief Officer of the Mataram.  Let him stick to his ship.  I simply won't have anything to do with anything military when I come back.
