  
 12/8/18 Framerville making the place rather unhealthy. Things settled down about dark and I went over and saw McCartin and had a talk with him about his action in case of attack and other matters. The men were all fallen in for their ration carrying parties and moved off to time. Behind us searchlights were picking out the sky. A m.g. from the left flank was extremely troublesome and enfiladed the valley. One bullet hit Goffin, an A Coys. b, and went right through him. He is a fat man and bled like a pig. Just before midnight I decided to go round the posts and took Sutherland and a runner. Things were quiet the night dark and flares going up well back. Strings of flaming onion signals at intervals.
