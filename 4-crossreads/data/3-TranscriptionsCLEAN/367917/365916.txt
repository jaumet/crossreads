But don't you think that the impediment in his speech will be a serious hindrance to him in the law, unless indeed he means to put it to advantage in earning refreshers in Equity. However I suspect that you have good grounds for hoping for its gradual cure. 
 This letter I am afraid must seem made up of envy malice hatred and all uncharitableness - mostly the effect of the cold. The nights grow chilly, and the prospect of a winter in some damaged village up front is not cheering. To tell the truth I believe I am getting fed up on this war. 
 Goodbye Eric Brissenden
