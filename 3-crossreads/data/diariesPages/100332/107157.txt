left at 4-36 Pm after a good run arrived in Poperinghe at 6 Pm. After making inquiries at the Control about a Train to Regersberg, they informed me that none would leave for some time, I decided to walk if I could not get a lift anyhow after going along the road for about a mile along came a Motor Transport I climbed up behind. The Driver said he was going to Eypres so I was alright for a lift. The distance to Eypres is about 9 miles from Poperinghe, when. The Transport was full of Boys going back to Camp after a somewhat rough ride I left the Lorry at the Reigersberg Railway Crossing in a few minutes was back in Camp. I signed on at Midnight during the Night Snow sleet began to fall although I when I was relieved at 8 am everything was covered with snow to about 3? in thickness, to a New chum it looked a beautiful sight all the Tents, Huts Dug Outs covered over with snow. When the Sun rose it made everything Glitter several of our boys amused themselves with snow balling each other.
