<p>else's hat. "Bluey" Cavanagh, such is his name &ndash; is a fine little chap in his own rough way &amp; I like him very much. He must be about 30 yrs of age &amp; was a "navvy" on the N.S.W. Railways. Although his manner is what might be expected under the circumstances, his heart is good, &amp; his feelings are extremely sensitive.
