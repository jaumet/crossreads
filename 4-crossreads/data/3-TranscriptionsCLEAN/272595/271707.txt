Went over & saw Len last night he tells me he is going to France at the end of the month.This morning I got a letter from Horsferry Rd. advising me that they had received my medal & that it would be presented to me at the earliest opportunity at a parade in England, I was beginning to wonder what had become of it, for I had heard nothing more since February when it came out in Battn. Orders & was read out on parade at Meteren.From what I can gather, I believe the 1st. Division has been badly cut up in the last advance round Libons.23rd.  Very cloudy & it looks a lot like rain this morning quite a change to the hot weather of the last week or two & I am not sorry for the change
