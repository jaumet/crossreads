 The only objects sighted since leaving were two sailing vessels (at different times) in the distance and a whale which was, however, to far away to be of much interest. No land has been seen for the last 20 days &ndash; it is nothing but a wide expanse of ocean on all sides. We seem to be entirely in a world of our own and with the exception of a few wireless messages bearing on the war ge no news.

Two more sporting days and organised concerts were enjoyed (Wednesday 22nd day out) and Saturday (25 day out). These were spent in playing cricket and also by working off sporting competitions, boxing and tug-a-war. The boxing tournament (divided into different divisions &ndash;
