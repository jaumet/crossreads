The Red Cross things have been invaluable work our bad bread &ndash; impossible for convalescent dysentery cases etc. The biscuits from Arnotts have been life saving. I have never eaten this bread since it made me ill the first try. It's quite sour. I live on biscuits bought at the canteen the ration biscuits are too hard.
