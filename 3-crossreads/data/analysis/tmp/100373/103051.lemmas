Had a look through the Moham Ali Mosqu . From the Citadel we drove through narrow street to the Bazaar district call " The Mouski" . Visit the Bazaar district was the most interest and the most fascin pastim that I had in Egypt . The Rue Mouski seem to be the place where the nativ do their commerci busi . It is not a veri broad street , and dure the day is veri busi . The men pass too and fro , usual in gaudili colour and flow robe , and wear on their head the favurit head gear , the Red Tarboosh or the Turban give the place a picturesqu Eastern appear . All along the street one find the shop , or a better term for them , stall are open to the street . One rare find a window in the shop . They have a veri leisur way of do busi . The peopl will sit for hour bargain for articl . One often come across the shop keeper and other seat insid the shop convers with one anoth in what seem to be a veri brother fashion . This seem to be amongst the Egyptian , a favourit pastim and a favourit mean of do busi . It is when I get into the side street or to be more correct alley that I find the greatest pleasur and fascin . In spite of the unkempt roadway and the musti smell one seem to forget these thing and look on the new scene , away from the heat of the burn sun , with great pleasur and a feel that one has been transport to a new and enchant world . Beauti engrav Brass and Copper ware are favourit articl of merchand with the nativ . These ornament , Coffe Set , Plate , Rose Bowl , Vase , Obelisk , Candlestick etc . are beauti engrav by hand . This process one see often be done by the nativ workmen outsid the shop door and it is marvel how expert they becom . Even littl boy about ten year of age turn out beauti work . The thing depict by the engrav are usual inscript from the Koran , or represent of Ancient Egyptian monument like the Pyramid , and the Sphinx and also stori of Ancient Egyptian Histori . As one make their way up the alley one feel as if the upper stori of the build are go to tumbl down on one 's head . One reflect that they have stood that way for age and we go on our way with a feel of relief . Next we see gaili colour slipper which look veri attract and quaint . Inside the recess one see the shoemak make these slipper . Stroll along to the next shop we find case of precious stone , some imit , but most are real ; so the shop keeper say ! Howev they look veri well inde , some except beauti . Other case contain ancient Egyptian Ornament , Scarab , Ring , etc . Pass on a littl further we come to the Silk warehous . There we find some love silk Shawl , Wrapp and beauti embroideri . A favourit articl to be found in these kind of place is the nativ tent work . This usual take the form of piec of cloth sewn on to a piec of stout canvass so as to form the figur of one of the mani Egyptian god . To look at these tent work figur from a short distanc they look exceed pretti . To wander round these various place one come across all kind of odditi in brass work , embroideri , carv in woodwork etc . Workmen at their various occup of repair carpet , polish precious stone , embroideri , make tarboosh , walk stick , form a veri interest and instruct part to a visit here . These thing are most hand done . The abov scene are repeat along the narrow alley . We meet some interest personag in these place . The waterman with his leather water bag over his back come down the alley distribut water to those who wish a drink or may be scatter the water on the ground to "lay the stone " . He is a pretti poor man and we learn that some of the busi men probabl had paid him for his bag of water thus the reason for his lavish manner of distribut the water . We meet women carri on their head cage-lik basket contain rabbit or poultri which are for sale . One also find that their are men who have travel a good bit to be found amongst these shop keeper . We ask one of the salesmen whi it was that they put a price on a certain articl and after bargain for a long time he seem quit pleas to accept half the first price
