 Then at 4 we went [indecipherable] the Q.M. store where I managed to get my Tunic changed for a new one. Also tried to get paid but failed. The Pay Sgt said I would get a Pay on the Boat.  I hope so as I'm broke &amp; a man will want a few shilling, for the Return trip on the Boat. After Tea Sgt Cropley &amp; I went into Weymouth. I met Bill Watson on the way in. He was at "Monte Video" waiting for a Boat. Sgt Cropley &amp; I went to the Jubilee Hall. We paid 1/10 each for a seat but it was a poor show.
