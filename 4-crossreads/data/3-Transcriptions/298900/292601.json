<p>Monday 31st December<br/>   Feeling pretty fit.   After breakfast went along by bus to S.M. &amp; Co to collect some money &amp; mail which would let me know where D.W.A. was.   Weather very mild &amp; did not wear greatcoat.   Drew &pound;10 to start with.   Had a walk round, London pleasing me muchly as usual &amp; came across a margarine queue, which was rather depressing.   Had lunch at the Y.M.C.A. Aldwych again &amp; sent off a letter to Mum.   In the afternoon I went out to NottingHill Gate to see D.W.A. &amp; Aunt &amp; spent the evening there.   Reached the Hotel at midnight being just in time to join a dance with which they brought the New Year in.   Danced till 3 A.M. but the show was a poor one being dominated by some wild Russians from the Embassy who carried on in such a way that it spoilt it for others.</p>
<p>Tuesday 1st January 1918<br/>The New Year and how does it find us, seemingly no nearer the end &amp; we are in</p>
