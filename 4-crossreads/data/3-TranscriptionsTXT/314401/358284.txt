  yesterday for to eight a.m. At seven we came up to the lighthouse which indicates the line of reef we are to avoid &amp; proceeding slowly we fetch up at Noumea at eight. This is a great convict transportation place, famous in the annals of crime, tho' I believe the actual transportation has ceased. It is a very interesting place to look    out  at, built like an old French town with all the appurtenances beloved of the soul of the Parisian in exile from Rue de la Pain. The Psyche, Pyramus, &amp; troopships are here &amp; we    find  fire the salute in honour of the French flag.

"The froggies always make holes in their targets before they start, which is I suppose as untrue as the remark is shrewd. The Montcalm is a good ship of about 10000 tons  but we are not flattered by her company. She wd. hinder us far more than she wd. help. We have had a good many people off from Noumea. I got in tow yesterday with French military officers &amp; civilians &amp; really it was very funny. We laughed so much that we cd. not speak but we seemed to understand all the same. With a good glass I search out the surrounding hills finding all sorts of interesting spots to look at. This morning a joy ship came from the
