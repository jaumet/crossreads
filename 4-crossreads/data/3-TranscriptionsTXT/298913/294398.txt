 Turn into bed at 11pm after going to a terrible picture show. What a glorious feeling. One has a cold shower &amp; then into a good, bed electric light &amp; every comfort. Awake 7am 
 22/3/16 &amp; Gippy brings tea &amp; biscuits. Boot black cleans leggings &amp; boots &amp; actually wants to backsheesh but gets nix. Gippy reminds us that it is 7.30 tell him to get out. 8.00 he returns &amp; again we refuse to take any notice 900 returns &amp; still we stay in bed. 9.30 we get out &amp; go to breakfast. 
 Go for row to the French  cruiser JAURIEGUIBERRY. A sailor show us all over &amp; explains in French of course. I am able to understand some of it so three other soldiers accompany us  so as to make out what was what. Little they knew that what I did not understand, I put my own construction to &amp; they thought me a good French scholar. Luckily I had no need to speak in French. This cruiser is bristling with guns &amp; like all this nation's boats is high up &amp; very powerfully built. Guns are beautifully balanced &amp; are easily moved by turning a small wheel. See the wireless room down below, also the torpedoes lying on the floor like polished porpoises. Awful clammy heat. 
 Catch  the 6.30 back to Kantara &amp; misery. Arrive there 7 pm so have to wait four hours for the puffing billy to leave 
 23/6/16 Leave Hill40 for El Fedant which is said to be a good place. Have to camp outside Kantara for the night, so go for swim in the canal &amp; then to sleep. 
 24/6/16 Up 4am  &amp; breakfast &amp; leave at 5am. Arrive at El  Fedan 5pm &amp; camp. This place (Rail head) is six miles out &amp; is a dismal place.
