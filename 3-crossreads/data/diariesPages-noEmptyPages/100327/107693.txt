Cruiser making for bay beyond hangars for shelter. A good deal of motor transport connected with R.N.A.S. HQ located in stone buildings. Mud everywhere still bad with dysentery and expect jaundice The latter is welcome as showing one was finished with dysentery and become acclimitized. GHQ now shifted to Lemnos 26 27 Battns taken there too. This place is going to be called HQ Dardanelles Army. The Camp arrangements of this Rest Camp faulty ? sanitation very bad indeed Sea rough. Monitor other warboats in the breakwater formed of sunken ships making shipping look heavier than it is. 
 
Some big men among the Turkish prisoners Greek Egyptian labour seems wasteful the latter particularly so. They seem to feel the cold and are just masses of moving blankets very gaudy in some cases. Every spare minute they are scratching away and feeling. British army pattern slacks are better than our breeches and puttees can be worn with them. The whole uniform is much neater. 
Field bakery a great sight rows and rows of Aldershot ovens. 
During early morning got tin of cocoa (good) at stall near wharf for a penny and also bought big hunk of plain cake, warm doughy sweet but better than issue biscuit. 
At 1700 though still threatening better weather conditions prevail, but still rotten. Imbros looks lovely from over sea but I don't want to come here again
