After the provisions were unloaded we were told that the American Ambassador was coming to pay us a visit in an hours time.  After 11.30 Mr. Phillips, attach\u00e9 to the American Embassy at Constantinople, arrived with his guard and servants.  He sat down at a table in the shade of the building with the Turkish officers.  We the English, were all fell in close by.  He called upon the senior British prisoners to give an account of our treatment and complaints etc.  He then asked how mahy of us there were and after finding out gave us each a Turkish pound (18/-).  He then told us that the provisions were for us alone.  He did not have the opportunity to say very much to us, we asked him if he thought we would be here for Christmas.  He said he could not say, but if we were he would not forget the plum puddings.  He also said he would not forget us when he got back to Constantinople.  After this he inspected our quarters after which he gave the French a Turkish pound each and &pound;36:0:0: amongst the Russians.  This was a pity the Russians did not get more.  Mr. Phillips explained that their interests were not in his hands and the money he gave them was on his own account.
