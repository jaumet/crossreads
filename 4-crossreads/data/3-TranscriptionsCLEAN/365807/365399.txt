to the Base Depot Commander about what time to expect me and what draft. On arrival at said Base Depot, I received orders to stop - meanwhile the rest of the Draft went on. The C.O. Depot communicated with the 1st Divisional Commander, and in due course I received orders to report to him personally.
Nobody could have been nicer than Gen. W.- or his Staff. That was on the 22nd April. No-one can get a Commission now except from a School, so I was sent to a School.  Gen W- put me up for the night and sent me - a Sergeant - next day in a car some 40 miles back to this School.
Here there were 6 of the old original diehards there - as well as others of the 1st Division who recognised me. There was quite a lot of mild excitement.
It was really quite pathetic the way my old fellows took charge of me - fixed my kit and bed, rifle etc. I was quite touched.
The School was at an old Chateau - a really beautiful but sadly in need of repair.
