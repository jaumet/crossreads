One would waddle over. A few vicious spits from the Hotchkiss and &ndash; finish Fritz's gun. They were game those Fritz gunners. They would fire their gun to the bitter end. No sign of our planes yet. Suddenly we saw a plane flying low coming right at us &ndash; about 20 feet up. We started firing but discovered that it was a Camel &ndash; one of ours. More of our planes now appeared and kept Fritz's planes well out of the way. Bayonvillers &ndash; a town on our right was heavily bombarded and all we could see of it was flying tiles roofs and dust and debris. This saved us going through it and capturing it. We crossed the East &ndash; West road just as the Hun</p>
