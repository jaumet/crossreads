  
 Bearers who have been in the line all the while. Once again we leave the line without one casualty. 
 December 17th 1917. Unit move off at 9:30 a.m. & march about a mile to the railway siding. As usual the train was late & we were obliged to wait over three hours before we entrained.  Even then it was close on an hour before the train actually started to move.  It was a most miserable trip,  the train simply crawled along & everybody jolly near perished with the cold. Of course travelling  3rd class  is  delightful  during such weather. At  2 a.m . the following day we arrived at ----- & after waiting on the station for about an hour (which was very pleasing this weather) we started off for our Village which I believe was about 3 1/2 miles away. It was most difficult walking along the frozen road, every now & again some one would topple over:  I came a cropper on several occasions. Our first glimpse of our village did not give us a good impression of our home, a hot drink was available on arriving at our destination,  then all turned in, dog tired & cold.
