  
 1915 Apr. 12 Mon. To-day one of the clerks in our Office had to go into hospital & I am doing his work as well as my own.  Kept busy until 9.45 p.m. Received 8 letters & 1 Newspaper to-day.  Last week's total was 15 & 3 newspapers - a record for me. There appears to be a very unorganised Australian Army mail service & of letters posted to me from Home, only some have reached me & vice versa.
