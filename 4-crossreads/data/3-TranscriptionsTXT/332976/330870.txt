June 1917went yesterday.   The fine weather still continues but we had what we would call in Australia a "Southerly Buster" at about 5 P.M. (but it came from the West.)   Last night some of Fritzs planes came over & "presented" us with a few bombs.7th   This morning the company went out for another route march with full packs & transport.   It was for a distance of about seven miles & when we returned to camp a "bathing parade" was held at Bapaume.8th   The big bombardment up north started last night & it is expected that a big push on that end of the line is about to take place.
