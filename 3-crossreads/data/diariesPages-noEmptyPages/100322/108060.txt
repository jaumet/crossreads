Cologne
A wet morning. Boarded the Boulogne express at 9.15 a.m. and the route lay over uninteresting scenery until Aix-la-Chapelle. This romantic old favourite resting place of Charlemagne seems a fine clean town but the surrounding scenery is not much. The scenery just about the Belgo-German frontier is rugged and craggy. Liege we passed on the outskirts and towards Namur the landscape got pretty again. Along the Meuse in places it much resembles the Rhine. Reached dirty Charleroi at about 5 pm and notice that Spring is far more backward than in Germany. To Cornils and Monsieur must needs crack two bottles of wine ? toper that he is. Dined en famille with Miles, Freddy Co ? good to be back ?home" again. Spent the evening reading mail and papers.
