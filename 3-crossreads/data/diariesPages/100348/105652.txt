a Military Policeman stopped us on the road and wanted us to show reason why he should not arrest us as deserters! The devotion to duty these gallant fellows show, is touching. He did not "pinch" us however; although my mate was sarcastic, and pointed out to him; that as a non-combatant, he should 
get himself paraded when he wanted to speak to fighting men. Spent the Day giving banjo selections on the gravel dump.

"Froggie" drivers brought in another trainload of macdam. We sent it on, to pave the way to Berlin. A fall of snow this afternoon after a hard frost this morning. The snow covered up the hideous water soaked landscape and made it look clean and nice.
