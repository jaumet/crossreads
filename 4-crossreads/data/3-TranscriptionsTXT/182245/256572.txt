FEBRUARY 1917
26 MONDAY
Fine & Sunny most of the day
& nice & warm. I was stableman
for the day. Capt Campbell
inspected again in the evening.
Serj. Major. Paton (or commonly
known as Satan) took
charge of the waggon lines
instead of Serj. Macintosh, much
to everybodys dissapointment.
We had to turn out & get
ammunition at 8 pm but
were back at 10. A team
went up & brought our
gun back to its position.
