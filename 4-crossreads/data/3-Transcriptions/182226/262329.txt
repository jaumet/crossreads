<p>Wednesday 3 November, 1915</p>
<p>No money, managed to live somehow till dinner time, after dinner I sold a pair of boots for 2/6 which will keep me alive till pay day.</p>
<p>Had to get up at 1 a.m. &amp; throw my bedding outside. I got dressed &amp; slept in my overcoat. I am one big flea bite allover</p>
