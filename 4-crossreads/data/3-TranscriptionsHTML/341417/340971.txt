<p>good observation.</p>
<p>My Colonel has just left us to go back to Australia. His name is Colonel Stevens CMG. DSO. and is a very good man. If you happen to know him or meet him at any patriotic movement mention my name and he will be quite pleased. He comes from Armidale. There is also some of my friends out of the Battn. gone with him and I am sure they fully deserve it. I suppose Miss King my time will come next so I will have to keep my head down for a while.<br/>You will be pleased to hear I have been promoted to Full Corporal and I can assure</p>
