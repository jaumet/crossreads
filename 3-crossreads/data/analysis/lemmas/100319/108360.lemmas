 7/9/18 Cappi Most of the men at Bath today . Had a busi morn do New Year Honour recommend and did not move out much all day . Our Band play in the afternoon . Camp along the Canal du Nord in littl bivouac and scatter dugout . The life will be pleasant provid the weather could keep good but I should like the men to get back to a place where they could see someth of French famili and girl and a littl civil . They might just as well be in the backblock as stuck out here perpetu in a militari zone . Had an earli mess to allow most of the Officer to go over to a 3rd Division concert parti over at Suzann just across the river where 3rd D.H.Q . were .
