<p>January, 1917. 3rd after Epiphany. Sunday 21<br/>Still cold. Usual routine with 2 trucks. At 12.30 pontoon pulled in and with out warning shells from heavy howitzers came over seeking guns. First two night over our heads about 20 yards away scatting buckets and stones everywhere &amp; we were lucky to dodge them. About 12 came over all dangerous and three shrapnel which killed one and wounded two of the 6" How battery. I hastened up the other end of the Dump and into a trench. Drivers unhooked and home for their lives and left pontoon until next morning. Home at 3 and got mobile more.</p>
