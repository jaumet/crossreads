 St Annes Raining hard stayed in bed for Breakfast this is colder than London I think.  They have rooms here a gentlewoman runs the house with her 17 year old daughter but I believe the Isherwoods are fairly well to do anyway Dolly wants to marry me &amp; come to Australia.  Probably go to Ireland at end of this week &amp; then return here. Love to you all &amp; some from Dolly.
