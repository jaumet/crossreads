<p>for my suit will be quite O.K.  God only knows how long it will be before I need it.  But in the event of the thing finishing up, we'll send our measurements &amp; faults &amp; D.J's can have 'em made up for us.  Look, Mum, don't you worry about me over-working.  I do my over-time by talking about what I should do.  Most of us hard-heads are like that, but work passes the day happily &amp; I knock off at 6 p.m. no matter what happens.  I have had many parcels from you all, but some of Bessie's, some of Mrs. Stephens, I never had.  It seems such a waste to make up a parcel for about 15/- &amp; lose it.  I think all my letters to Australia &amp; I've written 1250 since I left the lovely place, could be read by anyone &amp; no breach of promise cases or anything out of place could be found in any of 'em.  I am very very careful especially with people I am not too conversant with.  Of course with Auntie &amp; Marie &amp; Bess &amp; you all I can write whatever comes into my mind.</p>
