 Very nice day &amp; fine &ndash; On duty at Operating Tent. Not so many casualtys today, the 1st &amp; 2nd Divisions seem to be getting a rough time. German Aeroplanes dropping bombs freely during the night, very little damage done hereabouts &ndash; Our Guns bombarding very heavily during the night, which was a lovely clear moonlight. We got in a fellow with both legs blown off, he was leading a horse, when they walked on a dud &amp; it exploded &ndash; A Tommy while leading a horse to water, the horse fell thro a dug out &amp; inside there were two german spys.
