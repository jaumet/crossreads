 It consisted of a French Cruiser, Orotava, Argyllshire, Boonah, Afric, Beltana, which, with us, Marathon, City of Sparta, Borda, Durham Castle and H.M.S Kent, made up, after much manoeuvring for places, the entire convoy.&nbsp; After 11 am the Orotava turned away again towards Dakar.&nbsp; Had lecture on Engineering points in morning.&nbsp; In afternoon, did some Morse practice.&nbsp; Kent sent party of men off to the Boonah.&nbsp; Evidently some trouble there as the Kent turned right astern and made towards her.&nbsp; &pound;2 won for coaling prize devoted towards defraying cost of the Souvenir which is to be published on our arrival in England.&nbsp; Carried on a vote.

 Sunday.&nbsp; On guard again.&nbsp; Fifth time.&nbsp; New Year&#39;s Eve.&nbsp; Did duty on officers&#39; bar all through without changing position.&nbsp; N.C.O&#39;s had concert in Smoke Room in evening and all hands were mole-o.&nbsp; In fact, was not impressed with the way things went at all.&nbsp; There, drunken revels ceased towards 11 pm when I was relieved.&nbsp; Did not want to see the close of 1916.&nbsp; Thoughts are flooding me of home and friends and dear ones away back in dear old Aussie.&nbsp; Went to sleep with a countenance more in sorrow than Jest.

 New Year&#39;s Day.&nbsp; Came off Guard feeling dopy.&nbsp; Slept on deck part of the day, and listened to lecture by Lt. Gray the other part.&nbsp; The fact of being in a new year does not trouble me much, but I am wondering what all are doing at home and wishing I was there with them.&nbsp; Turned in at 6.45 under deck as we were runnning into a big storm and feared rain through the night.&nbsp; Slept well.
