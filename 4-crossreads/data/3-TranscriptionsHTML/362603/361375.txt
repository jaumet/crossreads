<p>3.  from a Miss Lottie Watman.  As I am on Night Duty it is just alright.  I have another one but this is a real beauty   &amp;   covers right down to my chest.  A Miss L. Robson sent a pair of socks    &amp;   Jessie Henderson a pair of mittens.  I do not know any of the Girls.  I will write a short note to thank each one.  We are all doing well   &amp;   have at last got rid of our colds.  We have had no leave yet.  It is pretty rotten but I suppose they think we are having a good time here while in France they are having a bad time.  Anyway we have good beds   &amp;   good tucker so must not grumble.<br/>Now, My dears, I've no news so I will have to say Good Night.  Best of love to You all<br/>From Harry X</p>
