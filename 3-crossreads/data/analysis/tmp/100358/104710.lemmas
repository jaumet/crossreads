 The lad are get well use to the routin now . The O.C. Troop , Colonel Burnag V.D. is Alan 's old Col. , the Colonel of the origin 13th Battn , who was respons for their first fine work on the Peninsular . His left arm is bad paralys but he has a well deserv soft job now . The men think he 's over the odd tho ? , with some of his sentenc . One man got 144 hour cell for be late on afternoon parad ! How 's that ? Still , they must realis that they are on activ servic now . We have a Sergeant 's mess which they say is suppli with regular 2nd class fare . But it not too good . We alway sleep on deck , and veri nice it is too . One of the Sister on board ( there are three , and all are return ) went over with us on the " Orsova " last year . We were refresh memori of that event trip yesterday , and she remark on the romanc of " Australia Day " night on the A 67 . There 's not doubt about it , we should have had a Kipl on board to describ the fantasi of that scene . You rememb , I wrote about it . But thing get monoton . We parad from 9.30 ? 12 everi morn and from 2.30 ? 4.30 everi afternoon , and do the same dead old exercis and stunt everi day . Sunday come like a lazi day amongst 6 dreari one , instead of a day of rest after 6 of toil . We do n't need sleep and yet sleep come . Hang over the rail onli produc sleep ? " When the water counten Blurr twixt glanc and second glanc ; When the tatter smoke forerun Ashen ?neath a silver sun ; " When the engin ? bate puls Scarc thrill the nose hull ; When the wash along the side Sound , a sudden , magnifi When the intoler blast Mark each blindfold minut pass " [Kipl ] But no doubt will spend mani more Sunday in this unsettl way , " Question a deep unseen " , and I onli hope a littl more resign . So , for a while good by , " Cook hous " will blow soon and I 'm Order Sergeant .
