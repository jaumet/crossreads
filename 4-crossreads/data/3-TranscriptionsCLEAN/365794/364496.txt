Thursday 5 [4] April 1917 [1918]Visited by the O.C. 10 a.m., he asks if quite comfortable etc. and neither of us betray the fact that I know all about his remarks re bells & subsequent wordy war with our quick tempered night sister who flies at me on one occasion when another pt. is ringing but she believes it is I.  How many things one learns when ill & how good it would be for all sisters & particularly M.O's if they could be patients for a few weeks!Have permission to rise so no more trouble with B.P's and am more content.
