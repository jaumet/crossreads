about 2 hours after the others  &  as tired as dogs,Saturday 30th Sept.According to the latest from HQ we are continuing our journey to Kantara on Monday morning.By accident yesterday I stumbled over an amusing incident. It appears that out at the Cholera Camp (which is now mafisch) on one occasion a fellow died suddenly  &  there was no parson available. So they had to improvise. Neither of the officers would read the service so one fellow took on the job  &  got they say, horribly tied up with the directions.
