post next morning.
9thCarried under an irregular fire from the enemy all day, had a few fairly narrow escapes, at night carried again - got lost in dark, but eventually found our dug-out.
During the night Fritz landed one shell into the side of our dug out - another one the top, both splashing us with mud but doing no damage, same dislodging a few feet of earth.  No rations came for us & it was very cold.
10thCarried again but very few shells came over to disturb us.  A little village to our left was shelled heavily, passed a quiet day & went for rations straightened our dug out.
