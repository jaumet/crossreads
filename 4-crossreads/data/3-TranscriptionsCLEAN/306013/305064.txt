Feb. 3. Up at 7 instead of 6 from now on owing to the severe cold. According to custom on Saturdays we went for a 6 miles route march with two bands, one of which was a Piper's band. These always accompany us on marches & to  & from parade. We wore our full kit. The afternoon we had off, there never being any parades from 12 on Saturday until Monday morning excepting Church Parade.
