26 July 1918FridayWeather getting considerably warmer. We passed through a large school of whales this morning of a large Kind. One was almost run down by us & then passed quite close by the Port-side of the ship. A little Wireless war news through Franco American army doing well. Nothing else of importance.
1918 July 27SaturdayNothing eventful to note. Reported that submarines are opperating rather plentifully in these waters - several ships being sunk & some submarines sighted. Rather an anxious time & a very strict lookout has to be Kept. Reported good news from the front in France. First pay day at sea.
