<p>comes to light &amp; is much appreciated, last night a Ventriloquist, actualled  amused us &ndash; One of the Sisters plays the Flute well &amp; a few Violins find some very fair handlers.</p>
<p>We passed the <u>Line</u> about 11 a.m. but we are sadly pressed for Deck Space, we were unable to indulge in any Neptunic pranks etc needless to add we were all keenly disappointed.</p>

<p>Very nice day. Impossible for sea to be any calmer, hardly a wave. A large P &amp; O Liner passed us for Australia 1.30 am, looked very pretty in the distance, all lit up. Another Boat passed about 10.30 am &ndash; although only passing, incidents in Civil life, it was quite an important topic today &ndash; for a change.<br/>Had some Sports on Deck this evening, 1 mile Race &ndash; Tug of War, etc.</p>
