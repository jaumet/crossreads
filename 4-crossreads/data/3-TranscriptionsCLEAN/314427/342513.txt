I  am  not working in the Smith's shop today, & don't expect to work there again unless I am deleted from the boat roll.
I am on guard today.  There are very few men in the camp now especially in No 2.Company. It will be the last guard that I will have to do in this camp. A large number of men went away from this camp last night to join the Corowa at Liverpool. Ward, Wetherell,  and Hodgson, formerly of the 37 Battalion, were amongst the men who went away from my hut 4.
I wrote to my Uncle Gilmore this morning, telling him that I was leaving by the Shropshire on or about the first of April. I was innoculated with many others for the long sea journey home to Australia.
[Shorthand transcribed as follows]  I wrote to Kitty Gilmore today also Mrs. Rilley at Coolaness.  [end of shorthand]
