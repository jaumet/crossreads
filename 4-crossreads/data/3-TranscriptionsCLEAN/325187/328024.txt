  
 [Sunday 8 October 1916] 
  Return to town  Went to Hyde Park Church Parade as I did 15 years ago, then lunched (with Dolly of course) at Hyde Park Hotel. Afterwards went to Miss Kate Pattersons Flat for Tea meeting Laura, Connie, & Rupert Mathews there- Was much interested in the lap dog crowd of well dressed men & women in the ROW. Last nights party with Laura was very enjoyable, it is wonderful how she keeps going. Poor Aunt A gets assistance from the  Ladies  Gentle womans Aid fund -   They always want to borrow I have none to lend especially now.
