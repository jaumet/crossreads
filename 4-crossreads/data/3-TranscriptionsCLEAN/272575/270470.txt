  
 a field card from him a few days ago, I expect that he will write later.   Have not been able to see Jack Howell yet we have not been stationed close to his Bat. but have passed them several times, he was O.K. when I heard of him last.   I may be able to see him, soon, if he is still allright his lot are somewhere near the line.   We had a pretty rough trip this time, the mud was cruel, and the shelling heavy, but we came through, it, though we had casualties, I cannot say how many.   Had a very nice letter from Mrs T.C. Barker.   I think that I told you, in one of my letters She sent me another parcel. it arrived last night, so I can consider that my Luck must be in this time.   The weather is growing colder here, and soon I expect, that, I will begin to feel it properly. allready my shoulders are very rheumaticky.   They may get bad enough to send me away from the Trenches and they may just keep as they are very uncomfortable, and aggravating.
