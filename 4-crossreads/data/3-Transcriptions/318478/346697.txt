<p>The said Dinkum accompanys me carrying my painting gear, himself and odd bits of salvage on a pack mule a female <strike>with</strike> of character.  I ride a very ugly plug, a small draughthorse which though unspeakably plain is useful &amp; has a fondness for the mule.  The mule breaks loose every 15 minutes or so when we camp for painting &amp; the Dinkum shows the stuff he's made of by sliding down the side of the precipice &amp; catching her, tethering her by some special stunt which he says will make her feel as happy as a Jew on the hobs of hell.  Then he climbs laboriously back to me &amp; by the time he reaches my summit she's off again, quite a good circus for a grey day.<br/>[Drawing]<br/>If the weather serves we move on, after mungaree, to the neck &amp; I swat at painting leaves, grass, &amp; small pebbles into the sketch of the Neck.</p>
