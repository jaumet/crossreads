<p>1918<br/>June 21<br/>to turn when Bill turned. Don McKinnon used to sing rather well and we used to make the nights hideous at times singing. The next morning I went out to Battn with Fatty Days to get some water. Fatty was very windy and just to show him that I was not, I said that we would return overland. Fatty was becoming windier every minute, and at last said "What's that place". I said "Dernancourt" but on looking again saw that it was Morlancourt. This meant that through my funny business we had been toddling along in full view of Fritz. We hopped into the trench, but Fritz must have seen us, for no sooner did we do so than he started sniping us with Whiz Bangs. Four landed very close to us, so we put down our heads, and ran our hardest up the trench, (still carrying the water though). While our company was in support, our Battalion raided Fritz. George Ogle our sig corporal was hit, Bill Collins being in charge of us. The raiders had been out training for some time and only came into the line to do the stunt, and then went straight</p>
