Understand, some of 1st L.H.F.A. remained to strike their tents & clean up their camp.Octr 19161/6th - Morning of 2nd left Romani. Mobile Section going overland on camel & remainder by rail. Did not leave till 8.30 & it was 5.15 on arriving at Hill 70. Gen'l Chauvel gave lecture on 1st & gave D.C.M. to Lt Finley on 7th L.H. earned on peninsula. Chauvel seems to be getting very unpopular & becoming Tommy-ised which troops do not like. Everyone against Hill 70. 1st went to swing bridge Kantara & getting leave to City Beach Sidi Bishr Alex'da. Long while in getting fixed up. Given Operating tent & eventually an E.P. S.S. Wilkinson returned. All sorts rumours & counter rumours
