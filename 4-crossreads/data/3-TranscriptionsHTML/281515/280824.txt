<p>When we got to our camp we arrived there at 1 oclock in the morning &amp; had a good feed of stew (a new dish in the army) &amp; Tea &amp; changed my socks &amp; took off my drawers &amp; turned them inside out &amp; put them on again &amp; laid down for a bit of a sleep when at 6.30  the same morning we got into motor cars to go off to the Somme this was the month of March &amp; we travelled all that day until 2 pm when we went into Billets for one night &amp; next morning we marched to a Railway station passing on the way Mont-de-Cats &amp; got on the train for Amiens &amp; from there after riding in cattle Trucks (8 chevioux or 40 Hommes) about 40 men in each Truck all day, we arrived &amp; got into Billets at Gudinette [?] where we only had one nights sleep.</p>
<p>then next day at 12.30 we got the order that we were wanted at once &amp; to pack up straight away &amp; be ready to get into cars at 1.30 pm so we got into the cars &amp; went quickly right through Amiens again to a village called Darnacourt where we got into Billets &amp; as it was raining hard all day we were glad of a bit of shelter.</p>
<p>we each got as many bombs as we could carry &amp; extra ammunition &amp; Tucker &amp; at 8.30 pm the same night started for the front where the Huns had broken through a few days before.  there were troops going in all directions, some coming down others going up, all seemed in a muddle to my mind.  Anyway we arrived at a village &amp; got in a big barn where we stayed two nights when we got orders to move up we were wandering about half the night</p>
