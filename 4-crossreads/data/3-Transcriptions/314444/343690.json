<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>We are very busy and moving so have not much time to write. I am waiting for mails from you. I recieved a nice watch from Aunt Florrie also writing material I also recieved another hamper from Arthur. I am as well as ever and feeling tip top. From all I can hear it won't be long before we are in France. I expect to be there by the time you recieve this. Address letters as usual. We are off somewhere &amp; will let you know as soon as we get it officially. Excuse short note. hoping you are all well. with love<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
