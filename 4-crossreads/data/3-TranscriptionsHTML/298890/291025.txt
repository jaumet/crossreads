<p>29 Thursday<br/>Dullish day but fine.  Pottered in morning.  In afternoon met Dr. B. Dick &amp; Sheilah &amp; a Mr. C. at Navy Stores for tea.  Called at Wilton for Feathers [indecipherable] &amp; home.  No joy in life.  Just dull stagnation of soul &amp; body.</p>
<p>30 Friday<br/>Went to Minerva &amp; worked in kitchen home at six.  Very cold &amp; comfortless in the house.</p>
<p>31 Saturday<br/>Dull cold day.  Wrote in morning.  In afternoon, Miss Harding, A.A. &amp; I went to Earl's Court to call on Mrs. Thompson-Price.  Home &amp; wrote some<br/>just perishing so did not feel well after it  Oh for warmth &amp; comfort again.</p>
