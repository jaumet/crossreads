<p>I have never seen so many men sea-sick before. Fortunately I was not one of these, but, to tell you the truth, I was not feeling too brisk &amp; if I had moved about, or, if the trip had been a little longer, I would have fallen a victim to the malady. Disembark at Folkstone at 6 p.m. in the good old country again, it does one good to see the place again. I could not help thinking what a wonderful organisation this Leave business is. Here is England at War, &amp; still thousands of men are proceeding, or returning from Leave, per week without mishaps. A really wonderful feat, this proves that England is not in the background yet, &amp; that our Navy is still very wide awake.<br/>At 7 p.m. we entrain, &amp; start for the journey to London. What a difference to those military trains in France travelling along on the average of 40 miles an hour &amp; in fine comfortable carriages. Arrived at Victoria Station at 10 p.m., &amp; find the place one mass of people &amp; excitement. The Australians numbering about 400, fall in &amp; we march to our Hd. Qrtrs. at Horseferry Road. This is where the luxuries of Leave begin &ndash; here I obtain a hot bath, and a brand <u>new outfit</u> from head to foot.  You can guess that I felt a new man again, after this performance was gone through.  Passes are then stamped, &amp; then at 12 p.m., I was through all the rigmarole, &amp; I was then a <u>free man</u>.</p>
