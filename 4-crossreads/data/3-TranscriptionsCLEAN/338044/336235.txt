18th August:- TuesdayWork as usual & plenty of it. Still unsettled & have lunch at the Soldier's Club. (Salvation Army auspice) in Rue La Fayette  After work go through the Cathedral. A truly beautiful building, but very ancient. The floor is merely cobbled & cold. The immense height of the walls add to this. Another long walk around the heights of the city climbing many streets right to the top of the hill. Some exceptionally fine residences here. Returning by several trams to town, feeling satisfied after viewing the French life at home. Pass down the street of La Gross Horloge, spanned at one part by a huge old clock, with one hand, said to be the oldest in the world
