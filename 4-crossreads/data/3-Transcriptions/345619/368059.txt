<p>5/5/18<br/>This is the other side of the church I have sent to Mother. We were only a few hours in Plymouth, so did not see all of the sights, but did see this lot. Am having the nicest time since I left home, and am writing you a letter in between times to tell you whats happening.<br/>love from your husband.</p>
