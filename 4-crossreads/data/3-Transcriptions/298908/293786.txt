<p>all outside &amp; took a few snaps.  I hope they turn out alright.<br/>Mr. Duke is going to send some flower seeds home he has some lovely ones &amp; they will be pleased with them.<br/>I gave my things another bit of a overhaul.  Mr. Duke is going to hang on to them till I send for them after the war.<br/>Charlie &amp; I left for London by the 10.17 train &amp; picked up the express at Arundel.  She was crowded out so we hopped into a 1st Class compartment &amp; stopped there till we reached London.  In the same compartment was an elderly gentleman who had spent many years in New South Wales &amp; was a great sportsman.  We yarned the whole way up.  The old chap still thinks there is no place like "Aussie" &amp; he is going back after the war.  He has the greatest admiration for the A.I.F. troops &amp; their record.<br/>I left Charlie at London, he went out to Brixton &amp; I to Paddington to put my things in the parcel office till the train left that night, its no use carrying them around with you in London.</p>
