 Sunday 5 August 1917 
 Now don't worry about me, I am better off here than anywhere &amp; I shall not be back for a fortnight so the Doctor says. Jessie McDonald is here as a nurse. Nowell Forth is at Abbussitta but I've not seen him for sometime. 
 It is very HOT but the Doctor says he will send me to ALEXANDRIA next week. 
  Meantime all my love from your son Frank.
