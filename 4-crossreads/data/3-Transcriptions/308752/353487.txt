<p>book &amp; mirror were the only articles found. Roy Wooller &amp; Bert Berry were wounded but not serious. I am sorry that I did not see Bert before he went away. Boarded the lorries at the Dressing Station &amp; conveyed back to our Unit where we all enjoyed a good hot bath &amp; a hot meal. Slept like a log during the night.</p>
<p>23rd September 1917.<br/>The next morning one of the Bearers, who was at our Post, collapsed in the Tent, delayed action gas,  he is now in Blighty. I consider Alf. Pitt is a lucky chap,  you will see him in that last photo. The bearers fall in again &amp; all conveyed by lorries to some big dugouts in that town I mentioned before,  we are billeted here till we are wanted in the Line. I see by the paper that the British have had a great victory &amp; that the Australians did well. Our bearers were evidently in one of the greatest advances on the Front. Several times I believe an advance has been attempted here but Fritz always secured the ground again. I have never seen so many aeroplanes about before, a marvellous sight. The dugout was a fine one, it could easily hold 200 men &amp; was lit up with electric light. Unfortunately we had no sooner settled down when A Section were ordered to move on. Arrived at the Dressing Station at 5 p.m. met O'Keefe (showed him Roy's letter which I received from him yesterday). We move on again &amp; are posted at a Relay Post about a mile from the Front Line. The noise of the Artillery was deafening,  guns all round the dugout. Our home was a long narrow passage, the place was damp, stuffy &amp; filthy. The odour was not too pleasant either. Other Bearers as infantry men were all camped up like sardines in the place. This is where we will stop for 24 hours, a pleasant prospect "I don't think".</p>
<p>Here again I must mention about the good work of the Y.M.C.A., not far from our dugout they have a free coffee stall &amp; of course it is continually under shell fire. The Ambulance we relieved had a few casualties this morning. We will certainly not be lonely tonight, the dugout is alive.</p>
