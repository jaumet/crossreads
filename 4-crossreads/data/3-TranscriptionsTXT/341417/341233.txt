 My Dear Mrs Dunlop 
 I received your lengthy &amp; welcome letter just before leaving Anzac. 
 Many thanks for your news &amp; cheerfulness. Give me a nice letter anytime, even before, [dash] an Australian Billy-can &amp; they are hard to beat for comforts, as we found out by the useful &amp; thoughtful articles they contained. 
 Many thanks Mrs Dunlop for your kind offer to forward anything for my men or myself. But, thanks to you good people at home &amp; the Government, no troops were ever looked after better than the A.I.F. We share in all goods,  which  that are "pooled" which I consider a very fair system. 
 Therefore you see, my men &amp; I have already shared in your generosity &amp; good works so along with others, you have a nation's continual thanks. I am well &amp; have been promoted captain since last I wrote. 
 News is scare here so I will enclose an account of the evacuation which might interest you &amp; the doctors. Being present on the first &amp; last day I am lucky to have seen the Alpha &amp; Omega of an exciting, though unsuccessful attempt to force the Dardenelles
