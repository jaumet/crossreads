W.I go to Sarum, visit Close. Go shopping & help to fix Elsie's skirt. Connie has chicken-pock. We laugh & play. I go to No 13 & amuse all generally. We dance & sing & laugh. I go Home with Nurse Win. Go to bed with Mr Edwards. Percy is Home & discharged.
I am reckoned a bad un by all 'cos I don't care where I sleep.
