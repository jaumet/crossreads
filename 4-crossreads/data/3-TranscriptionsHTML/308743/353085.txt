Riding follows under [indecipherable] &amp; he as usual does his nut he galloped for miles &amp; then comes down to the {indecipherable] after lunch I went out again under [indecipherable] this time we went over to [indecipherable] the men as usual go for an exploring trip whilst Bert &amp; I make plans for the future .  Nell comes into it of course , The L Horse have been putting in splendid work all day they now are working in squadrons. After Tea Teddy gets his first lesson in [indecipherable] he gets only 3 falls &amp; then a drunk shoves him &ndash; over head the boss ordered me to avert them which I did but at the time I didn't at all like the job, the main guard form the gate arrest him.
