have been here 6 weeks ago, when not so cold & nice & dry. From our front line can be seen the steeple of a Church at Bapaume. Had a bit of so called stew & tea both cold. Rations supposed to be issued to squads of 12 men - quite a mystery none to be found - to bed a stiff - sore - cold & wet Australian dinkum.

Drizzling Rain. Had the day off till 4 pm then started for "Turk Lane" - relieved the 8th - Did an awful perish all night - altho 3 of us worked hard all day trying to make a bit of a shelter - it kept the wind & cold out a bit, but the rain came thro. Made a fire in a tin & nursed it during the night. Ted Powell went to sleep with feet against the tin - I also had just dozed off when I was rudely awakened by "Powell" falling over me, this puttees alight - I burnt all my hands trying to smother it - Fairly busy during the night. Guns going a treat all around us without cessation. Fritz replying poorly.

Drizzling rain & cold as frogs - Shifted up to Grove Avenue - fairly busy. About a dozen of our bearers are out of action through blightys - sprained ankles
