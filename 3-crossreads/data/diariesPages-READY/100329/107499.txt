Our magazines were charged with 10 rounds & we carried an additional 200. It was not long before the snipers found us out & we were peppered with lead from the at short intervals. The range however must have been difficult & no casualties resulted. Moreover we were protected by the shore batteries, mainly howitzers (N.Z. & English) with a range to 2000 yds. Turning to the right from the shore along wh we had been proceeding at a distance of about 200 yds. we soon came to Div. Hqs. Here we rested but as it afforded no great protection for such a large number of troops were we soon quickly moved on, taking an abrupt turn to the left & ascended a rocky pass between in single file, the track being only fit for mules. Simply a goat track.
