October 1917to 3.
Saturday 6thMore enemy planes came over at a great height & were heavily fired at.  One unexploded shell fell fairly close.  Some thought it was a bomb coming down & ran for a ditch.  Was having a bath at the time & had to stand fast.  Brigade sports were held today.  There were some good events.  The band was playing & General Allenby & Genl Chaytor were both present.
Sunday 7th to Sunday 14thWe have had an easy week.  The weather has got a good deal cooler & several mornings have been very foggy.  The afternoons have been dusty.  Football has been continued with vigour  Several squadron matches & 2 inter regimental matches, both of which were draws.  We had the pleasure of seeing a German aeroplane brought in.  It was brought down by one of ours over the Wadi & the pilot was captured behind the lines.  Our air service has improved considerably.  There are some splendid aeroplanes here now & they ought to shake Jacko up a bit.
