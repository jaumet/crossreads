<p>Jan 17th  This morning the ground etc were covered to four inches with snow and we had much enjoyment from snowballing  Also had a hare hunt over the hill behind the camp and had best bit of sport I have had for months.  Caught one hare.<br/>Jan 18th  Snow beginning to thaw and making things sloppy.  Another hare hunt with one catch.<br/>Jan 20th  Snow still on the ground &amp; weather cold but no happenings.  We move in a day or so to another sector of this front.<br/>Jan 23rd  Still bitterly cold though fine  Move from Buire to Albert where we billeted in the school.  We are moving up to the line about Martenpeich &amp; forming an A.D.S. at Bazentin le petit.<br/>Jan 24th  At Albert.  Still very cold &amp; fine   Move up to-morrow.  Fritz has been shelling Albert to-day but I have heard of no casualties   Go on leave on 29th so can't see much use of going up the line at all. <br/> Jan 25th.  March from Albert to Bazentin A.D.S. &amp; thence to the line to the left of Flers.  We went through Contalmaison &amp; past old Casualty Corner, but the place is not recognisable, compared with July 23rd.  Things are quiet here but the Division comes in tomorrow.  The snow is still covering the ground and has no[w] frozen &amp; is hard &amp; slippy walking.<br/>Jan 26th  Snow still on the ground which is very hard &amp; good for shell bursting.  Move back to Edwards post in anticipation of going on leave.  Everything is quiet &amp; very few men come through  Days are very clear &amp; frosty.<br/>Jan 27th .  As yesterday.  On ration fatigue to Bazentin.  Rumoured that leave has been stopped on acount of traffic congestion.<br/>Jan 28th   Came back to A.D.S. at Bazentin in anticipation of going on leave but find it postponed owing to the railway congestion   The British are taking over the line to Peronne now &amp; so causing congestion.</p>
