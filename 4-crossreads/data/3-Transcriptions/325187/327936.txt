<p>Every tent has a Chameleon these days, they take me back to a School Break Up many years ago &amp; the "PIECE" I had to recite-<br/>Here, one Tommy says they even turn the color of the <strike>net</strike> meshes in the Mosquitoe Netts.<br/>A Chameleon lives on Flies so is never hungry here &amp; is valued at 6 packets of Cigarettes.<br/>I had one in my Tent in No 2 General Hospital Pretoria.</p>
