Still in the same place. Our fleet has however increased. Th "Aurange" (?) arrived this morning from Sydney with stores medals. We went ashore again for musketry sat all day under a weeping forest. Returning we saw indications that the journey was to be resumed. Great joy on board.
September 1st Tuesday
Despite above stated indications of a continuation of our voyage, we are still here. Early this morning the lighter "Bobbie Towns" came alongside with stores from Townsville. A party of "H" company ("H" every time) spent all the morning removing the dead. We stacked 70000 lbs of best Queensland beef in the refrigerator received our rum allowance. 
The lighter brought newspapers ? the Townsville Daily ;the Nth Queensland Register ? aboard. Rags of the first water though they are they were more welcome than "Truth" on a wet Sunday. We may sail tonight. There is a prayer meeting in progress on deck to ask the almighty to instil into the Brigadier's heart the desire to advance.
