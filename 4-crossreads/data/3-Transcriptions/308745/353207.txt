<p>[Continued from next page]<br/>We have just been out on deck<br/>Watching manly couples  peck<br/>At each other with a pillow<br/>Swaying with each stormy billow</p>
<p>We are glad to be at last<br/>Midst our own compatriots east<br/>Cuspidors &amp; toothpicks banished<br/>Bossy, saggy trousers vanished.</p>
<p>We have not been asked our age<br/>Second name or hopes of marriage<br/>Haven't even had our steward<br/>Ask if seasickness is cured</p>
<p>Captain Phillips is so jolly<br/>Tales part in all youthful folly<br/>Such as cricket on the deck</p>
<p>Poor old Nelson H. Duval<br/>Pronounce it so's to rhyme with "call"<br/>Accompanied by James B. Haney<br/>Saw us off, altho' 'twas rainy.</p>
<p>Nelson H. sent P some roses<br/>In what capacity he poses<br/>Is evident in little ways<br/>He called 5 times in 7 days</p>
