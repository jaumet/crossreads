 hit his trench. It was the prettiest sight that I have ever seen. We had a good view of his trench for a great distance and the barrage hit it all the way along as though somebody had pressed a button. Well that was our signal to advance, as was arranged before hand. First of all I will tell you how we were loaded. I was in the second wave and was carrying, likewise everybody else, battle order equipment, rifle &amp; bayonet, a shovel or pick, four sandbags and a bag of 40 Mills Bombs. Some load to be getting along at the high port through a barrage with, wasn't it? Well we only advanced a couple of yards when Ikyl got busy with his flares; red ones, pink &amp; blue ones, and white ones. Then Hell broke loose; machine guns cacheted; snipers and bombers got busy, and we got into Fritz barrage. We got to the wire and found it cut nicely, then Jack Young and I, I was alongside of him, were blown up with a Minenwerfer, but neither of us were hurt.
