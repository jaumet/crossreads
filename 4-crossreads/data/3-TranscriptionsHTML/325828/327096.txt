<p>R.A.F. Armament School, Uxbridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 22.8.18.<br/>England, Wednesday 3.6.18</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I was glad to receive yours of 7th April yesterday.  Altho' this letter only reached me yesterday, one from you dated a <strike>fortnight</strike> week later arrived nearly 3 weeks ago.  The mails are very irregular here both outgoing &amp; incoming.  It was in your letter of the 14th April that I learned that Rid had reached home safely.  I was very glad to hear this both for his own &amp; also Ol's sake.  I often wish I could drop in &amp; see you all again if it was only a 24 hour visit.<br/>Never mind, Dad, wait till the Imperial Air Service between England &amp; Australia is established with a 6 days trip.  It will be worth while coming home then, when I am in command of one of those international machines &amp; have 3 months leave of absence granted.<br/>In my last letter from Oxford I acknowledged the receipt of the remittance for &pound;10 that I cabled for &amp; also the parcel sent from A. H &amp; Sons.  So far, I have received 2 parcels <strike>from</strike> through A.H. &amp; Sons, from Auntie and Uncle &amp; have acknowledged them.  From your letter there is evidently another parcel on its way.<br/>I got through all my Exams at Oxford alright.  My average for the whole of the subjects was 91&percnt; .  Out of the 26 Australian Cadets only 2 failed, so that is fairly satisfactory.  After finishing our course at Oxford we were granted 6 days leave.  I need hardly say that I spent them at Elsie's home, &amp; had a quiet but enjoyable time.<br/>I am greatly relieved that I have passed through Oxford satisfactorily, for you know I have for some time past been very keen on this branch of the service, &amp; only hope I get through my practical flying alright.  I am looking forward to the day when I arrive home with my wings up, &amp; perhaps a little bit of ribbon tucked away underneath them.</p>
