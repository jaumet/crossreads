<p>Sunday May 27. 1917.<br/>It is hot again today<br/>There is good growth in vegetation of all kinds. The crops are coming on splendid. All the trees are covered with leaves, and most of them are done flowering. The cherries have fruit on them about the size of peas, and I anticipate that about the end of June there will be ripe cherries on the trees.<br/>Some of the other fruit trees are in full bloom and look splendid.<br/>The country looks splendid and it is a pity that there is a war on.<br/>The total number of prisoners taken by the Italians on the corso front now numbers 10,245, and much war material is captured.<br/>Mr <strike>Lys</strike> Lloyd George made an important statement in the House of Commons on the Submarine menace that there was an unexpected improvement.</p>
<p>Monday May 28. 1917,<br/>It is again hot to day<br/>There is a lot of aerial activity this morning. Fritz has been over several times and each time got away safely. His big guns are also very active.<br/>I heard today that the 38 battalion was cut to pieces last night</p>
