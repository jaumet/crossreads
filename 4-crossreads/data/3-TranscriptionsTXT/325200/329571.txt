the number reported there yesterday   camp  came over  &  dropped two bombs to help matters along. The camp was rushed  &  found to contain in all five Bedouins, two killed, two wounded,  &  one intact whom they immediately took prisoner. He was a man of exceptional physique for a native  &  when we saw him trotting behind his guard, he was clad in a rough cloak  &  hood of goats hair which came just down to his hips.As things turned out this stunt was pure murder. We reached here again at about 8 oclock on Sunday night.
