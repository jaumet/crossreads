  
 across & about 8 ft Deep with pieces of shell cases laying in the bottom, three Trucks of Shells were actually riddled with holes & pieces of Flesh hanging to the wood work, & on the ground near by I saw a large number of bodies of poor fellows rolled up in Blankets & on Stretchers.   These poor lads were so much blown about that there were pieces & absolutely unrecognizable.   There were shells blown about everywhere & if it was not for the Sand Bag Mounds between stacks of shells the Explosion would have been worse.  An Engine of the Light Railways standing a little distance away had the Glass Windows smashed but the crew we unhurt.   A large number of men were unloading Mine Earth out of Trucks & several were killed outright by concussion & not a scratch on them & others were injured.   The poor lads who were actually unloading the shells out of the Trucks, they were never found as they received the full force of the explosion.   This working party had only started there in the morning for the first shift & out of the Coy only about 50 answered the Roll Call in the Evening.   There are difference of opinion as to how the explosion occurred, some say that a Fritz Aeroplane was being chased over head by several of our Machines & he had dropped a Bomb & struck the Heap of Shells & others say a Motor Car Wheel had struck a nose
