The above named Ship was about 4000 tons  and She was used for a hospital Ship  But She Did not Keep up to that. She was more like a Pig Stye that any thing. At the beginning of December 1915 I went on Board this Ship and She was then laying off Anzac. The Ship had to lay out with frost Bitten Cases abord her her for over 48 hours. The food that we received was Bully Beef and Biscuits [indecipherable] for
