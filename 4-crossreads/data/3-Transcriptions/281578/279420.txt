<p>had disembarked at the historic old spot of Calais. We wore life-belts on the run across. I can hardly believe I am in France. Oh well, we are right at the serious part of the business now, &amp; a big gun firing near where we landed gave a chap a nasty reminder he&#39;s at the real thing now. On stepping ashore there was a Red Cross train waiting, filled with wounded from the present big battle, about to go across to &quot;Blighty&quot;, where we had just come from. We marched off with this awful load on our back, &amp; wondering how far we would have to lump it. Passed a camp of Chinese who do labour duties, they were looking through barbed wire fences like monkeys. Imagine trying to control them in action, eh, wouldn&#39;t they yabber? Saw French soldiers in all colored uniforms, Belgians, Scotties in their skirts &amp; bare knees. Our packs were feeling very weighty, &amp; shoulders getting pinched, when we had a halt, &amp; immediately flopped down on the ground for a rest, near a hospital, where we saw some Aussies come out for a yarn.</p>
