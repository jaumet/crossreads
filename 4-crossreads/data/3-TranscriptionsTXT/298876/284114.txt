TuesdayFeb 1st 1916   First day out from Brisbane, fixing up Hospital etc, everything "chaos". All AMC. men very busy, getting Hospital ready, unpacking drugs & sorting also all sorts of Surgical instruments, all new & freshly packed by Elliott Bros - the order must have run into 4 figures, very interesting to say the least.Have made the acquaintance of Dr O'Reilly, Nurse Avenell, Nurse McKenzie, all very nice & they are about as popular with us AMC boys as a blooming private. 10 cases in the Hospital up to 3 pm today - most by affects of yesterday & vaccination, one accident on board - man ran a knife thro boot & cut two sinews.Have passed the Paringa outward & the Empire has passed us badly - very calm only a few sick, tip top myself, eating like a horse, rattling good tucker & plenty of it hope they will keep it up, just got a wireless to arrive Sydney 3 pm  tomorrow.
