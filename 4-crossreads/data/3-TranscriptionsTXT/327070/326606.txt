 Wednesday 2 February 1916 
 A beautiful bright sunny day with a cool breeze blowing from the N. Sea wonderfully smooth &amp; very little motion noticeable, not as much as one usually gets when going to Manly. 
 Orderly officer of the day &amp; up at 5.30. Kept going during the day attending to the various duties, getting the men off the decks &amp; their hammocks &amp; blankets below, cleaning up the troop-decks &amp; getting the ship ready for the inspection which is made by the Commander, Colonel, &amp; various other officials each day at 11 am. 
 At 2 o'clock a special meeting for officers &amp; sergeants was called by the colonel &amp; instructions issued about the method to be adopted in case of submarine attack. A practice with ball ammunition was given in the afternoon but could scarcely be called a success. With further practice we can look for some improvement. 
 At night the boxing contest was continued. 
 Ship's run to noon was 362 mls, with 281 mls still to go before reaching Colombo.
