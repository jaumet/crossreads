"Quaker Girl"
Come with me  Come to the ballMusic & Merriment callGolden & Gay are the lamps aboveEvery tune is a song of loveLadies that come to the ballI am in love with you allEach has a part in my heartAt the ball  At the ballCome to the dances while you mayFlowers & Romance fade with the dayCome in your beauty fair as a roseDancing's a duty everyone knows
A Long Long Trail
There's a long long trail a windingInto the land of my dreamsWhere the Nightingale is singingAnd the White moon beamsTheres a long long night of waitingTill my dreams all come trueTill the day when I'll be goingDown the long long trail with you
