 The gas school was on the northern ridge overlooking Harfleur  Ruelles.  Directly one has passed through Harfleur  Ruelles &amp; turned to the left down the valley, the scenery is entirely different.

We left the road about a mile along &amp; turned to the left, for the camp is on the left ridge of the valley, but we can see the main road go straight along following a course half way up the opposite ridge, past chateaux &amp; beautifully neat country houses of a good size
