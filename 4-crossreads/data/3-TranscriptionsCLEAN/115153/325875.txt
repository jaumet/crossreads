  
 much disappointment among the troops on board as they were not allowed leave to go ashore, but the Red Cross ladies came on board and gave us a treat to fruit,  cigarettes, and sweets. The ladies also took letters from the boys, and posted them ashore, so that our relatives would get them before we landed in the Eastern States. We sailed from here and passed through the Australian Bight uneventfully until we reached Adelaide, where we discharged more troops.  After a very brief stay of 2 hours in Adelaide port, we sailed again for Melbourne. On the same evening the weather became very threatening and the sea very rough, and at midnight our ship was battling against a heavy storm. The situation was very dangerous to the ship and all the lives on board at one period and we were wakened by the siren whistle after which we donned our lifebelts and went to the boat stations in readiness in case of emergency. Eventually the storm subsided and we retired to our bunks again, and in the morning were surprised to see the damage that was wrought by the storm. The ship would have been more able to withstand the storm had the strikers in Fremantle allowed the cargo of lead to be put aboard for ballast, as was intended. At 5 o'clock the following morning we found ourselves waiting outside the Port Phillip Heads, waiting to be piloted up the Bay to Port Melbourne. We were piloted up the bay and drew up alongside the Port Melbourne pier at 10 o'clock. After being issued with furlough passes on board the ship, we passed down the gangway and from there took our seats in waiting motor- cars which conveyed us through the City midst cheering crowds until we reached the Victoria Barracks. I got my kit bags there after some waiting about, and then departed on my 17days leave to the country. When my leave expired I reported back to the Caulfield Military Hospital where I stayed under treatment for 3 months, after which I was discharged on 16th January 1918. 
 During the two years, I saw the best of life and the worst of life, and after all, when I take the rough with the smooth, I can say I have had as experience which I shall never regret. 5035, Signaller J.P. Irwin, 21st Battalion 3/6/19
