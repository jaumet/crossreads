 Tues June 13th - 16 Last night at 12 the Arty arranged a raid with the infantry. While all guns were firing, certain raiding parties jumped the parapets and laid low until at a given signal the guns increased their range and the infantry advanced towards the germans trenches under shelter of our fire.
