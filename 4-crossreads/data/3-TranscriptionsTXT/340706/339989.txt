I manage to get down for lunch.
We pass two depots for tanks at one of which there must have been at least 200 in rows. On return to my carriage I find Col Dicken of Shropshire & Junior Carlton Club in my compartment & we have a good yarn.
After much slow progress we reach Etaples. The usual time of journey for a troop train is 7 1/2 hrs & yet we are 29 hours late. Have supper at the Etaples Club for 2 fr. I have 2 large plates of meat & chips & go down to station to catch train at midnight. However as she does not go till 2 am I sleep in a YMCA on the station at railway yard & am called at 2. Train however is no hurry & does not leave till 4.20. We have a brasier in waggon there are no carriages on train & towards morning feel the effects so badly that I have to hang outside the train to get fresh air.
11-1-1919Arrived at Abbeville. There is another officer getting out here G H Jones 227 Field Coy RE-BEF. He say that if I throw out my valise at the cloak room it will save being carried back. He throws it out & it immediately falls back under the train & is hopelessly cut about & covered in grease. So dirty is it that the disagreeable chap in cloakroom refused to take it
