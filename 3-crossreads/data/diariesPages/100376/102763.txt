Went through the inhalor to-day. This is an iron chamber with a few perforations in the side. Through these holes medicated steam is put through and about seventy of us standing in this chamber for ten minutes are supposed to be immune from the deadly germs of Pneumonic Influenza.
Saw a very pretty sight to-day. Sailing down the bay was a five mast schooner. This gave the place an old world appearance.
