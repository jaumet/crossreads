  
 at Grove Park, Kent & they made me very welcome, taking me around the beautiful Parks shrubberies & a lot of nice sceneries.  They asked me to stay all night & made me very comfortable.  Young Mr Henderson & Miss Henderson then came one evening & had dinner with me at the Imperial & went to Daly's Theatre, "Betty" afterwards with me.  He had only been back from France a few days where he had been for 9 months & was wounded.  He is to return there when better.  The rest of my time I spent working. 
 July 26th (Monday)  Leaving London today after 3 weeks stay & we are bound for Middlesbrough in the North sea up past Scarborough & Whitby where the German Naval raids were made.  There was 7 ships sank yesterday off Lowestoft, which point we pass on the way, but as the submarines responsible will now get hunted out of that we ought to be pretty safe. 
 July 27th Arrived Middlesbrough after an uneventful trip.  Passed a lot of our Fleet & Trawlers sweeping for mines & saw two of them rake one up right alongside of us. 
 Aug 15th (Sunday) Left Middlesbrough for Australia via Durban at 5 a.m. with 4,500 tons of steel rails for the Victorian Railway Commissioners.  Middlesbrough is chiefly an iron smelting & ship building place.  They are at present building Monitors with shallow draught & big 9.2 guns, as big almost as the ship itself, one on each & an anti-aircraft gun on the poop.  They build these at the rate of one a week
