<p>P.S.<br/>Taking up a small edition of Hy. [Henry] viii by William Shakespeare, it opens at converse between the Lord Chamberlain and Anne Bullen, maid of honour to Queen Catherine:/</p>
<p>[Act ii, Scene 3, Lines 57-73]<br/>Chamb:/<br/>You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings<br/>Follow such creatures.  That you may, fair lady,<br/>Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's<br/>Ta'en of your many virtues, the King's Majesty<br/>Commends his good opinion of you, and<br/>Does purpose honour to you no less flowing<br/>Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which title<br/>A thousand pound a year, annual support,<br/>Out of his grace he adds.</p>
<p>Anne:/<br/>I do not know<br/>What kind of my obedience I should tender,<br/>More than my all is nothing:  nor my prayers<br/>Are not words duly hallowed, nor my wishes<br/>Worth more than empty vanities; yet prayers &amp; wishes<br/>Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,<br/>Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,<br/>As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness,<br/>Whose health and I royalty I pray for."</p>
<p>Note how simple and straightforward each is made to speak, as bearer of a gracious message from one most highly place, and one poor in worldly wealth returning thanks.</p>
