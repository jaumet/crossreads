 22/1/17. Did a route march with packs up. Got letters this afternoon. Wrote some letters for we shall not be long now. 23/1/17. I guessed so. Gave in our blankets and marched from Bazeiux to Becourt Camp; about 12 miles. The coldest day I have ever known. Sent for a dixie of beer tonight, and it froze solid before we could drink it. Made the blokes gnash their teeth a bit. The ground is freezing hard tonight; all the better finish mud! 26/1/17. Rolled Blankets and moved up about five miles and went into huts at Bazentim. Covers with moustaches are busy shaving them off now, for they were coated with ice today; as their breath froze in the frosty air. Paid 20 Frs.
