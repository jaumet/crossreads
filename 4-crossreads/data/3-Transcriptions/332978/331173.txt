<p>I adjourned to my room after a most enjoyable evening about 1 am when Tremlott &amp; I had a few words resulting in me being pulled out of bed about 14 times.</p>
<p>Room 67 raided our room at my instigation; &amp; we had a great old ruff &amp; tumble for quite half an hour. Onlookers were highly amused. This attack was launched as a reprisal for the bad treatment meted out to Chisholm, the treatment to Chisholm being a reprisal for the bad treatment I've received on numerous occasions from Room 67.</p>
