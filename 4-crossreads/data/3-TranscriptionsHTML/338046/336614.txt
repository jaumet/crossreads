<p>1917<br/>Nov 2<br/>got a small piece of carpet. The gaol seems to have been strongly built, as it was still serviceable and was being used as a barracks. as it was getting dark we turned our backs on this dead city and caught another lorry for home. After a few miles this one refused to go and on opening the bonnet, the Tommy driver discovered that his engine was red hot as he had not a drop of water left in his radiator. His mate waddled about in the mud trying to find some water but he was unsuccessful so as we heard another lorry coming we transferred ourselves to it and finished our journey. Incidentally I tore a large hole in the knee of my trousers in alighting. The next day Sunday went to church in the Anzac Coves Hall and after dinner took a lorry for Reninghelst. It is one of then usual style of Flemish villages. The church was of the usual sort. There is not much worthy of remark about them except that the seats are turned back to front. The people use them to rest on when kneeling and then turn them about</p>
