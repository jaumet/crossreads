Part 1 Para 1 Detail Orderly Officer tomorrow :- Lt. R.P.Sutcliffe. Next for duty:- Lt. G. Stobie Para 2 Boots Company Commander will take steps to assure themselves that Boots are regurlarly and properly dubbined. The supply of dubbin is quite sufficient if properly used. To allow of every mans boots being regurlarly and satisfactorly treated care must be taken that the dubbin is properly rubbed in and not smeared on the surface only and that if possible it is applied when the Boot is dry. The matter is to be looked upon as important.
Para 3 Collection of Rubble:- It has been noticed that waggons are taking bricks from Vlamartinghe and Ypres without taking into consideration the desirability of takin maintaining cover from bie?n. In future bo more Rubble Bricks etc are to be taken from Vlameringthe or houses in that neighbourhood.
