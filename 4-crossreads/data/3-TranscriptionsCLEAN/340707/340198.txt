  
 produce some evidence to Minister of Education I will be able to sit for degree of LLB - a two years course & I have 8 mos to take it & the exam is oral & in french 
 So first visit I make is to Kit Store get the certificate - my coco palm walking stick & several things of use to me & then back to town - to Bank & draw all I have 16 leaving 30/- in Bank. This is all my reserve. 
 I then visit Alcock but they are closed. I then make arrangement to repair my stick & have job finished to day as I intend to leave London Saturday night if I can get all done. 
 I see [indecipherable] & French contingent arrive & then at Moss find that a ready to wear uniform costs 7 1/2 gns. I visit [Dean] & buy some puttees, collars shoes (17/6) & then Myers Tunic & slacks 2-10-0 Buttons must be changed etc but still a great saving. Then to Dean & annex a civilian suit for 5 & hat 4/6. In Strand I got silk faced white shirt for 8/6 & repairs to walking stick cost 2/6. 
 As I can move quicker without parcels I adopt plan of buying & leaving parcels & of course fail to collect one worth 2-9-0 a havresack with puttees etc. This means that I must wait till Monday, & pay for two days extra here & in France. However it is better to do this than lose 2-9-0 
 I dine to night as usual in Soho
