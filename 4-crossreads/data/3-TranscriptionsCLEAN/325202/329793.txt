  
 been doing the odd jobs that are always waiting with a pair of horses & a waggon - For instance groom horses, pull them a bag full of green grass from the hedge bottoms as a treat, the my "bits", grease the waggon wheels - 
 Aeroplanes very active overhead today as is always the case on a fine calm day 
 June 1/16 Very heavy artillery firing last night - one of the Artillery Brigades was moving out into the Reserves & another Bgde taking its place The Germans had probably got wind of the change & chosen the opportunity for bombarding the gun positions
