  
 exploration with the view in mind that a reign of stalemate existed in this region for 2 years & consequently much time was available for perfecting the defences of which I am writing. Of the German trenches themselves, they present a very sorry appearance, having been battered & torn about by the terrific artillery fire which they were subjected to. To a depth of 10 feet the fire was most effective but beyond this depth not much damage was done. 
 The trenches wind in zig zag all over the place always presenting an angle to the line of fire & in each bay of the trenches, marvellously executed work in the shape of dugouts & underground chambers are built. 
 These dugouts or underground passages run down to a great depth, one in particular being 100 feet below the level of the ground. The entrances are well finished & boarded in, properly built steps lead down, some of which have several flights of stairs & fully 20 bedrooms & chambers leading off from each flight. 
 Air machines on top pump the air down through tubes & in one case there was a light railway track constructed which worked by a windlass. 
 The value of such construction is at once apparent, during a bombardment the defenders can leave the trench & remain in perfect safety, until the fire ceases then re-appearing they were always able to repulse all attacks. However this availed them little against
