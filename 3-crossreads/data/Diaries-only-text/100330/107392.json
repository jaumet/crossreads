for him you could hear him flying around looking for our Railway Depot Gun positions also the Bombs he dropped, four Bombs exploded in quick time away over from our Camp. This performance usually only lasts for about 30 minutes. I am sorry to say that my companion the 1st A.M.C Officer had to go into Hospital on Wednesday Evening, he had been aching for 2 or 3 days finally went saw the Dr who pronounced his complaint as Trench Fever ordered him at once into Hospital. now I have to handle the A M C work on my own, I devote all my time to the work having been releived of the position of Sanitary Engineer temporarly until my Mate returns, which I hope will be soon.
