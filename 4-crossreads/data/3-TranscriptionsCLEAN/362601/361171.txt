10 March, Monday
F.I pack up for Isle of Man. Travel to Salisbury with Slade. I visit Cis & the Close. Good trip to London. Tea at A.B.C. in L'pool & go to Landing Stage. No boat & I walk around nearly get into a Court case because of a coquettish Miss who does not want to be kissed. I have to go to Y.M.C.A. & can't find my bed. I go to sleep on Top bunk & hang my gear up like the presents that Santa Claus hangs.
11 March, Tuesday
F.I walk all around Town & Breakfast twice. Go down onboard & get straight to bed. Calm trip & arrived 4.45 pm by Douglas. Chat with N.Z. Arrive Milling Bridge & get ride to St Judes. I expect to meet Auntie & Marie & sure enough I meet them half way to St Judes. I am happy to be Home & although I had an awful feeling of sea sickness before going on boat, I fare very well.
