<p>quarters which are in two of the Mountain Battery tents.<br/>The camp is situated right in the country three miles from West Maitland and we amuse ourselves by felling the trees in the neighbourhood.<br/>Major Kerr is now in charge of the Hospital. He is a very fussy old gent and causes us great annoyance by hopping out of his tent all hours and poking round to see that his numerous orders are being complied with. The patients have dubbed him Daddy Xmas. He is a very good doctor and despite the fact that he is a mere wisp of man and must be about 70 years old he is most energetic.<br/>I paid a visit to Newcastle the Friday before last. I wasn't much impressed with its appearance but could not judge very well at night and with only a few hours in which to look round. The old steam trains which are also at Maitland look very up-to-date. I think Armidale although much smaller is brighter and livelier than either Newcastle or Maitland. I have quite a number of photographs taken but not yet developed. I hope to be able to send some by my next letter. I will, in all probability be home on final leave the week after next.<br/>I have now more news now so I will close, with best love to all<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene.</p>
