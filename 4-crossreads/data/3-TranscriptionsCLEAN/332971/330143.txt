  
 from Colonel not to - that was rather a disappointment as several wanted to go to Kandy, Mt Lavinia & other beauty spots - anyway all soon fell to & made the most of things. Everything was so interesting - how those natives beat anything I ever struck for sharpness - There was the many oriental shops to see - the rickshaw rides down to the Cinnamon Gardens, back to the Galle Face Hotel for dinner - another rickshaw ride  along  by the seaside - afternoon tea - a little more shopping when we found things greatly reduced - then back on board by 6pm. No one was allowed in the streets after 6pm . We saw several shops that had been battered to pieces. Several were closed & trade generally at a standstill. Our people all suffering in consequence as having an over full ward boat some supplies had run out especially in the soft drink line - Now we have to wait for Bombay. There were numbers more passengers came on & where they are all stowed is a mystery. Amongst those taken on are a number of Japanese boys going home to study for Doctors. We seem to have every nationality on board "barring Germans". The little stowaway was handed over to the Colombo police.
