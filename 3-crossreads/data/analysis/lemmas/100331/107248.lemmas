 Our 12 15 " Gun all around were blaze away at Fritz , it is was like the old say ( Cannon to Right , Cannon to the left in fact Cannon were all around us , what a terrif nois , you could hear the 15 " when they fire they gave a doubl bang the 12 " a singl bang . As Fritz was send heavi stuff over , our Gun were warm up to the engag , as the 12 " were fire I could see long tongu of Flame belch forth in their Anger , it was a glorious Sight although terribl , everi time a 15 " would fire my Engine would trembl ( No 3092 ) . The Patrol parti had a job to do as the line behind the Big Gun had been blown up by Fritz at 6 am in the morn , it was a veri close call for all hand , the Shell explod about 20 ft behind the concuss knock the gunner over but did not hurt anyon . It took 40 " to unload the truck as it was get to hot around about , we were order to clear out to Reigersberg
