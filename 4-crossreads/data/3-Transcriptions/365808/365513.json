<p>(2)<br/>receive your cable. Thank you for sending it nevertheless. I called at the Eastern Cable in Cairo the day I left &amp; asked them if I could use the Cable form you gave me through the Cairo office. The manager was away and they could not tell me whether they would be accepted or not so I have not used any so far.<br/>Everything is fairly quiet here, at least as far as the LH are concerned. I dont  know what the Infantry are doing at all &ndash; they are on the western end of the line &ndash; towards the coast &ndash; or at least I presume they are tho' I have never seen any infantry since coming up. All around here are LH and Yeomanry. We have had one or two stunts lately &ndash; lasting a couple of days first &ndash; but nothing at all big. Our new G.O.C. arrived some time back &ndash; Gen Allenby &ndash; &amp; was up her a week ago, having a look round I suppose.<br/>We should be into the rainy season here in another month or two. The rainfall is I think about 23 inches and it all falls in about 2 months of the year. I don't think that has always been so. The appearance of the wadis or water courses suggest an enormous rainfall at some time. Either here or up in the hills to the N &amp; E.<br/>The one from which we draw our water supply (from springs &ndash; not rain water) is in places &frac12; half a mile wide with extremely precipitous sides as though a tremendous force of water had come down &ndash; not only from the direction of its flow but from all sides.</p>
