worry their heads in the slightest over anyone, she's the roughest joint I have ever seen, as for tucker well dont mention it, nothing but salty kippers or rabbits make's me sick to look at them, its a regular starvation hole for a sick man.
28th. Still as sick as ever fed up with the place, the weather is very hot this makes it worse, I managed to crawl out of bed go along to the canteen get a cup of tea, while there I strikes old Bandy a little bow legged chap who knocks about the wards doing any little odd jobs for the boys, by a marvellous piece of luck I got 3 rolls of films from him, I had been trying to get some everywhere but had no luck here I went picked a bunch up in one of the last places I expected as they are very scarce.
