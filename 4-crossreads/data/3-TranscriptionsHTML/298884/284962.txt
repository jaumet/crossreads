<p>A most unfortunate affair occurred between myself &amp; my company commander Capt. Titford M.C. M.M. I was ordered to do the seemingly impossible and I <strike>replied</strike> spoke (in a language quite unbecoming any officer), to Capt Titford. The unfortunate part of the business was that it occurred in front of the men.  I consider that the happiest man in the world is the man who is on good terms with himself and I am glad to say that I have since apologised to my worthy O.C.</p>
<p><u>14th</u>  Last night was the warmest night we have had since leaving England &amp; the heat <strike>grew</strike> became so intense during the forenoon today</p>
