27.5.15Thurs. 27th.  The Warboats have been rumbling like thunder all day.  Things are quiet here generally but we had to stand to arms at 8.30 this morning as a dozen or so Japanese bombs were hoisted into the Turkish trenches & it was thought that they may get desperate & charge us, but they did not, although the bombs played havoc with their trenches.  Our aeroplane was only one day off duty & she is as busy as usual again hovering over us.  Snipers have given us a fairly safe time to-day, "a bit of a change from yesterday".  It is rumored here that the Majestic has also been sunk, but rumors are afloat of peace & several other things & are generally taken with a grain of salt.  The only reliable news we get of the war is what happens in & around this valley (known as Shrapnel Valley & it has earned its name).
