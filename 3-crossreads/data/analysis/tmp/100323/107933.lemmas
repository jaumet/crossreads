 10/7/19 Chemnitz Bay of Biscay Inspect the ship with Capt . Young and found thing fair good the meal better and all fair satisfi . The Bay of Biscay was calm enough today and I do n't think that thus far anyon has been ill . Our R.C. padr ( Padr Fox ) is a good chap and a fine versatil conversationalist . Sport materi was distribut today and much use . The Band play in the even and then a danc was held in the dark to piano tune . A white hors sea make boat toss a bit tonight . We are mile out from land as far as the eye can see is a toss wast of water . Some men stand watch it for hour ? it is like watch the leap flame of a fire . The wave are everchang as they dash on .
