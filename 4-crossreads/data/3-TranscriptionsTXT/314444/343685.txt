 I saw Oscar Walford the other night &amp; he is looking quite well. The weather is beautiful here, could not be better How are all the boys &amp; girls give my kind regards to them all. I suppose we will wait here until the Spring &amp; then get a move on to France or some where else. Hope it is all over by then, although myself I like to be doing my bit at the right thing I have a big mail to answer so must close &amp; write in a few days again. Hoping you are all well as this leaves me. Best wishes &amp; love Your loving Son Tom.
