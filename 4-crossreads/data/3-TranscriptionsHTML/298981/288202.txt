<p>Chapter 9</p>
<p>Suvla Bay</p>
<p>From the mountains our lads scanned the tracks from shore,<br/>For reinforcements that were to arrive.<br/>Though our limbs were weary and our feet were sore,<br/><strike>They</strike> We were as active as bees in a hive,<br/>On our sunburnt faces you saw traces of joy,<br/>As we glanced at the calm Suvla &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay,<br/>Those troopships we saw, where the sea meets the sky,<br/>Had brought thousands to join in the fray,<br/>Hope encouraged our boys to continue the fight,<br/>Hope was fighting with <strike>the fight</strike> us against fate.<br/>Fate won, for help was delayed through the night.<br/>The relief, came too late, yes too late.</p>
<p>Sgt. Fraser.</p>
