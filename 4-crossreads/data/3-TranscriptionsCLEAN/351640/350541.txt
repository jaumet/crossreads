P.S.Taking up a small edition of Hy. [Henry] viii by William Shakespeare, it opens at converse between the Lord Chamberlain and Anne Bullen, maid of honour to Queen Catherine:/
[Act ii, Scene 3, Lines 57-73]Chamb:/You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessingsFollow such creatures.  That you may, fair lady,Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note'sTa'en of your many virtues, the King's MajestyCommends his good opinion of you, andDoes purpose honour to you no less flowingThan Marchioness of Pembroke; to which titleA thousand pound a year, annual support,Out of his grace he adds.
Anne:/I do not knowWhat kind of my obedience I should tender,More than my all is nothing:  nor my prayersAre not words duly hallowed, nor my wishesWorth more than empty vanities; yet prayers & wishesAre all I can return. Beseech your lordship,Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness,Whose health and I royalty I pray for."
Note how simple and straightforward each is made to speak, as bearer of a gracious message from one most highly place, and one poor in worldly wealth returning thanks.
