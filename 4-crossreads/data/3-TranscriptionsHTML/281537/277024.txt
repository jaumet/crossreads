<p>12/10/15  Johnstons Jolly<br/>firesteps the men yarn smoke &amp; clean their rifles.  We have some very good shots and so has Abdul.  Potting at loopholes is good practice.  Great expression is possy = place.  Our Kings prizeman (Bisley) Thurlow does good sniping work and lies in this little sniper's nest waiting for Abdul to visit his latrines and then shooting him</p>
<p>13/9/15<br/>The usual routine.  Men in supports at toilet one shaving another "washing" &ndash; a wipe with damp rag.  Others chasing scotch greys.  Several using firesticks to burn them out of the seams &ndash; some of these chaps are Block knots!  Spent evening in firing line quiet.  A few wounded.  One chap killed.  He was just breathing when the stretcher passed me</p>
