<p>"Gib it. 2 piastre buksheesh cried one burly Soudanese<br/>They replied, "Ma f'eesh for loose, yer maris, analla booke emshe"<br/>(Arabic for I have no money you blackgaurds)<br/>Get off the earth clear out)</p>
<p>But Waney "Man of action" &amp; quick of thought is he<br/>Chose two large hunks of metal &amp; a deadly shot, shot he<br/>A cry, a thud, a pool of blood, did tell the deadly tale<br/>But nigger reinforcements had heard that gruesome wail<br/>They raced from lonely alleys they burst from every door<br/>They called to one another &amp; rolled up by the score</p>
<p>The original offenders had no faith in Roman gods<br/>Dived straight into a gharrie &amp; left Wane to face the odds<br/>He was keen to stand &amp; fight 'em "turn em down" &amp; go alone<br/>But discretion outed valour &amp; he tried to make for home</p>
