head qrs in London.  It was a new order out that every one had to make a will & leave with our Head qrs as there has been so much trouble lately men being killed & not leaving a will.  We had Holman here a few days ago he inspected the Brigade then gave an address.  I also had a letter from Bert last week.  He said he was beginning to get his parcels alright now.  I think it waste of time sending parcels to me now.  I have had letters saying parcels have been sent but so far haveint received one.  I can't get the parcels that are being sent from England to me so don't expect the Australian ones to fair any better.  I can't make out what happens to them.  Some one gets them that is certain.  Well Father there is no news to tell you will close.  Will write again in a few days.Love to allYour sincereson Clyde
