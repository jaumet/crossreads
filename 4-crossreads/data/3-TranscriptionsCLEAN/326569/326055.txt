  
 Walked round various streets & down to beach & on way back met a Mrs. Eyre (she stopped me in street) whose husband has a chemists shop in Scarboro.  She is Australian but has lived there 18 yrs., coming from Mansfield, Victoria.  She invited me to her home if ever I went to Scarboro again.  Had lunch at Rowntrees & caught 1.20 p.m. express to York.  At Kirkham Abbey passed old ruins.  Arrived York about 2.30 p.m. & saw Cathedral in distance.  Caught train 3.12 p.m. for London & arrived Kings Cross 7.30 p.m. only making one stop on journey - at Grantham.
