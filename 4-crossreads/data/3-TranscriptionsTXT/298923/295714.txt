 17 February 1918 Sunday We have been issued with STEEL HELMETS &amp; the boys chaff each other by calling out "Have you seen the " "Orsetralians about chum" pretending they are Tommies. Moved on another 15 miles over stony rises along the old Turkish railway Joppa-Jerusalem- now in good order again- We captured many engines &amp; much rolling stocks last STUNT. Camped at  Zacheriyeh  along lime stone hills &amp; Caves-   On the march I noticed many Cyclamen in bloom, the same mauve color as glass at Carrakoorte.  Did not Zachereyih live in a tree here!!! Somewhere?
