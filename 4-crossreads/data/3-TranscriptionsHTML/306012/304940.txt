<p>Sun. 11th Aug.<br/>Sudden orders received to move off at noon.  6th Field packed their waggons &amp; moved up to M.D.S.  We marched off &frac12; an hour later out of St. Acheul, on through battered Longerau where we turned off the Roye Road on the fine route leading to Villers-Bretonneux.  Near Blangy Tronville we reached the camp occupied by our C Section where we had tea and then continued our journey to Villers-Bretonneux 6&frac12; kilometres further on.  The road was alive with traffic &amp;</p>
