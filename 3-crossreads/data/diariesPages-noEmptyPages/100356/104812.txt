Revielle as usual
Got mail right up to date, tuned up machine after its trying ordeal with the Boss found only the foot rests broken. Charlie broke 11 spokes in his back wheel which took a little renovating, Mels gigger stood up to it tip top averaged about 60 ml to the gallon not too bad for a brand new scrap, nothing much doing in the morning only erected a permanent air-line with Gov posts, in the afternoon I rode hem out for exercise he is in tip top fettle again am now looking forward to the race, no letter from Alec yet no mail from home, weather been exceptionally cold of late especially at nights.
All hands getting heartily sick of this caper all want to go into action again. 2nd Regt played Welsh Bn footy the match resulted in a draw both sides scoring nil.
Bed 9 pm.

Hopped out as usual at 6
No work today after first parade as Regt was holding sports, they started off with tug-of-war on horseback several good pulls were witnessed the horses knowing as much about it as the men, then they had wrestling on horse back, judging distances, alarm race in which teams of 4 competed, they were supposed to be asleep undressed with their horse tethered handy, on the bugle they dressed, saddled up galloped into action fired 5 rounds galloped back. The winners took only 4 mins, then they had the best turnout of teams of 4, 8 teams entered it took all the afternoon to judge as they were so near perfection, the men were a credit to any country, tug-of-war on the ground brought out several good pulls the final taking 5 minutes, on the whole the Sports were a gigantic success.
