Firing Line. Le Sars11/2/17  Stayed up all night and called Hamilton who is doing Intelligence at 4 a.m. Believe that 7 prisoners were taken by our raiders at the Maze. The day was quiet and before lunch Cull and I walked over to 19th H.Q. and reconnoitred area there. We went too far to the right first and pulled up in 18th. Going over the open gets a good birdseye view of the country. The snow gradually melting but everything is white still. In a hollow lies the strafed rectangle of Le Sars. Our guns got busy on working parties and other targets and the Butte got a fair amount of plastering as usual. Turned into bed about 4 and was not resting long until the relieving C.O. turned up and we yarned for a while. The evening was quiet and Bazeley came back and had plenty to tell us of his experiences. Quite a lot of parties passing on the communication trenches on ration and other fatigues. Slept on in bunk until after midnight
