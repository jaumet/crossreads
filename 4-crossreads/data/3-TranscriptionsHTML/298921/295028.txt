<p>February, 1915<br/>Wednesday 24<br/>Received letter from May today dated 28/12/14, also a letter from Sydney &ndash; more talk of moving very soon it is hard to tell whether I go or stay, as the Regiment is full of Officers &ndash; but Col [indecipherable] wants me so he says &amp; I know it is true. When we drill in the Desert [indecipherable] boys seem to spring out of the sand at every [indecipherable] "Orangie big one [indecipherable] piastre" or Eggs "cook" two for one (piastre) [indecipherable] cooked eggs &ndash; they wear robes of white or [indecipherable] &amp; add color to the landscape.</p>
