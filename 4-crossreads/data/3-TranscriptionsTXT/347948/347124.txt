We saw the Salisbury Cathedral which is the most Prominent feature of the place.  It has the appearance of being very old and has a spire of a very great height.  More particulars of this when I get them.There is a water street here with houses and a footpath on each side.  There is very little water in it at present being mid summer.There is a big Gothic gateway leading to the Cathedral and this is locked up every night to everyone but those who live
