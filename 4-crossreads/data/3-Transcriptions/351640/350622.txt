<p>I do not know if in an earlier letter I wrote that an article with a photograph had gone forward to the Nurses Journal, a paper published in Sydney, on a trip to Sakkara.  Should it be published the girls might send on a copy to you.</p>
<p>13-3-15: 10 a.m.  Hurrah!  Hurrah!!!  Hurrah!!!!!  Letters from Car, Joseph, Kitty, &amp; Doffie this morning.  Each bears date 12-1-15.</p>
<p>Car &amp; Joe each made reference to your approaching visit to Santa Sabina and to a visit paid by all the girls with Maria Watt to see Mary at Strathfield.</p>
<p>Definite orders are contained in yesterday's Corps Orders, giving notice to every one to pack his goods &amp; chattels, &amp; to hold himself in readiness for leaving at any moment.  I have an inkling that I am to be left behind for a week or two to conclude matters in this place and that I shall come on soon after the remainder of our people.  I had rather to be with them, but it cannot be helped, &amp; one has but to perform what falls to his chance in a game of this kind.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took a day off &amp; went to the brigades on the Heliopolis side &amp; had a day on Manouvre.  Colonel Monash was the brigadier of the troops with whom I worked.  Jack McGlynn [McGlinn], brother to the girls in Maitland is chief executive officer with the brigadier while a younger brother, Joe McGlynn [McGlinn], is a junior officer.  I met many men of my acquaintance.  The <strike>day</strike> work was long</p>
<p>[Lieutenant Joseph Francis McGlinn, 40, telegraphist of Liverpool, NSW, embarked from Melbourne on 22 December 1914 on HMAT A30 Borda with the 2nd Divisional Signal Company. He served at Gallipoli and was invalided home to Australia in early 1916.]</p>
