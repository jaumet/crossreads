 Dickebusch Left camp about 8.30am with 2 pack mules arr. Spoil Bunk about 10 am where we salvaged 4.5 howz. from old battery position and tool them to the roadside. Dinner 12 til l2 finished about 2.30pm. Brought 4 shells back to dump (near our camp) on off mule. Fritz shelling very heavy about a mile to the right of us. Taubes a bit quieter tonight. Our planes had a box with a Taube.
