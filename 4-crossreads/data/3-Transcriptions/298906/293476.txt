<p>among the stuff so long, but there you are red tape again. Saw Don Fraser over there while we were going through was surprised to see Don. After coming back from our gas test we were supposed to wear our gas helmets for an hour, you can bet we done this, just sat on the forms &amp; waited till the hour was up then done a get for the rest of the morning.<br/>We were not on parade this afternoon, either Capt McGregor told us to get away out of sight we are a regular nuisance to most of the officers over here, they cant bounce us like they do the reinforcements &amp; NCO.s</p>
