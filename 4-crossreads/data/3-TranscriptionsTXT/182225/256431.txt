 NOV. &nbsp; WEDNESDAY 8 &nbsp; 1916 
 Fine but it was very cold &amp; miserable. I was on the manure waggon in morning &amp; went to Amesbury &nbsp;&amp; unloaded it about the stables all the afternoon. Saw Campbell about my transfer in evening &amp; he said he would fix me up all right but I want a couple of particulars from Alan&nbsp;before sending in my paper.
