 Father dear, I had a yarn with Captain Parkinson who will remember at School.  He asked kindly after you &amp; how your health was keeping He was saying that Lieutenant N. E. Biden died at Mudros Lemnos Island whilst he was over there.  Capt. P's address in case you want to write him would be 1st Field Ambulance. A.I.F, Egypt Love from Leo.
