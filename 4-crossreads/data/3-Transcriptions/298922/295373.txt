<p>*The New Chums"</p>
<p>The Yeomanry left a few decent Papers among them. I found a 'BULUWAYO' Times, mentioned many places I camped in in RHODESIA, so when I leave the 'Deniliquin Independent' &amp; Walgett Spectator the new comers from perhaps Canada, will find some news on Australian. Our men are always <strike>giving</strike> barracking *the New Chums about riding. As one fellow was leaving here with Saddlery badly put on, he was hailed with &ndash; "Put the Saddle further back, your reins are too long".</p>
<p>General - <strike>J.B. Meredith</strike> our old Colonel visited us &ndash; I am not changing I am too fond of the old Regiment.</p>
