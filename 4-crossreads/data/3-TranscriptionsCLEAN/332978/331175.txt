 Arthur Dent is here - a great shock when I first saw him, he was posted as "killed in action". Had long yarn with him & from all accounts he has had a very bad time. His Bn let him down, or sold him a pup, the Stunt he was in. 
 It is very cold here &  all  I am feeling rather depressed. I have been invited to mess with Gracie & Dalgety & co for the time being. Stones is in another mess, likewise Tremlott. 
 December 10th Paraded to Dr & granted permission to be absent from Roll Call. Nothing to do here except walk around & hot air & play cards. Saw Cull & McQuiggan, also met aust flying officer named Norvel. He has lost the use of one arm - 
 Played Bridge - 
 December 11th Very cold - Up early - today has been an eventful one for me. I with 80 others was examined by a Swiss & German Commission for repatriation. It was not a very thorough exam - He  read  a German General read my medical History & after a careful perusal of the X ray proof, had a look at my ankle & said that I would go to Switzerland. It was all over in about 5 mins, & just before I left, I was informed that I would be going to Chateau D'eaux - 
 The Commission examine the men at Mannheim tomorrow. Several officers have failed to arrive in time for the Commission. Played Bridge & had yarn with Cull. 
 December 12th Taking Life very easy now. Simply sleep eat & play Bridge. Several officers arrived today  & appeare  met the Commission at their hotel on their return from Mannheim, & as they had finished supper & partaken of wine &c the candidates in question had no difficulty in passing for eligible for internment in Switzerland
