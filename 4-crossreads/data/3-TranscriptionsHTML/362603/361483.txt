<p>4.  Ellis did.  I was away on Duty at a camp called Hurdcott about 20 miles away.  Eric Hynde is in Perham Downs Camp with the 19th Batt.  Reg Keirle is in that Camp too.  Was sorry to hear that poor old Bucks lost His arm.  I met Frank Sanders, Teddy Sanders the carrier's Son over here.  He was going to write Home &amp; have our names put on the Burwood Roll of Honour.<br/>I got Ida Nelson's socks &amp; wrote &amp; thanked Her for Them.  Thanks per post is not very much, but what can we do else.  Well Mum, I must go up to the Artillery Lines now to play the Hymns so will close.  I will try &amp; write to dad after I return at 9.30 pm.<br/>I am just feeling O.K. &amp; rode the 12 &frac12; miles to Salisbury up Hill &amp; down dale in 40 minutes on a heavy wet road.  Weight now 10 st 8 lbs.<br/>Lots of Love<br/>Harry.</p>
