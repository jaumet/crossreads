<p>There is little more news to tell, and the rain is coming again which means that I must close the mouth of the dugout or get wet.   Then it is too dark to write ..   Last Tuesday I was away on a courtmartial as witness and after the business was over we went to see the Divvy entertainers "The Sentimental Blokes.   they are very good for amateurs .. there are only a couple of pro's in the troupe one a lady impersonator, who is very good he figured in Adelaide sometime ago.    made a bet with a friend that he would pose as girl for 3 months without being found out, and the story goes, that he chose one of the leading Barristers in that city for a victim, and made quite a big mistake, for when the gentleman found out, he made things hot for the joker, who got six months jail for his little game.   Over here he is the leading lady with the troupe, and makes quite a Chic and dainty miss.   One day when going to see them, a Tommy from the R.G.A.</p>
