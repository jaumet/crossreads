 Orders to be prepared to move off at minute's notice issued  Pack only to be carried. Great sorting out of clothes &amp; kit. Quite useless a lot of clothes &amp; stuff away with one. All have to be ultimately discarded  Left my white kit away back at Doulieu, now throw away my black. No parades today. Great cricket match between A sec. &amp; B. sec. keen rivalry. A beaten hands down. B get their own back from yesterday's football. Old Joe Graham the cook gives us good dinner &amp; tea  Custards &amp; jellies plum pudding &amp; sauce.
