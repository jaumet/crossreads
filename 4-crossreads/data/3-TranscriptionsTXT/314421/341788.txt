 It was very cold on picquet last night. There was a white frost &amp; ice on the water. 
 We were paid to day. I drew 20 francs. 14/8. Charlie Charles &amp; Jack Mathews came back from Paris leave last night. They much prefer Paris to Blighty, and enjoyed their holiday.

 We left the camp at Rue de Sac, Romarin this morning and went to Hill side Camp, Neuve Eglise a few miles away arriving before dinner. This camp is much inferior to the last one, and the stables have not been completed, not having any roof on, although the rafters are up. The huts are also inferior, having low sides and no sand bag protection. They were also filthy. To night I went out with Alic Holmes &amp; we had a feed of eggs.
