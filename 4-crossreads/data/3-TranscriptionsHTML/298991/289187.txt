<p>Saturday July 7th<br/>Job very quiet in store. The lads under 19 pest us now &amp; again for changes, there is pracitally nothing in the store, so we have the same old storey to tell them "nothing doing". There was a draft of men go to Lark Hill this morning, so every A.M.C man in camp now is put on fatigues.</p>
<p>Sunday July 8th<br/>Too busy to go to church parade this morning, so I went down to a service in the Y.M.C.A. this afternoon. We very seldom have to work on a Sunday afternoon, unless there is a draft going out or coming in.</p>
<p>Monday July 9th<br/>Put in for leave to go to London, this morning. Was recommended by the Quarter Master. I put in for 48 hrs from 11 to 13th July. Not feeling too well today. Was classified this morning &amp; marked B2A. (6 months in England) &amp; recommended for a board to see if I am permantly unfit for further field service. One thing I do not want to go back to France. Weighed myself today, have lost seven pounds since coming from Perham Downs camp.</p>
