ready to leave for Ismailia tomorrow.
11th Left camp at 8.30 am and boarded 9 am train for Ismailia arriving there at 10.15 am. I was then attached to the 18th ASC temporily until house accomodation could be found.
13th left for Cairo at 10 am where I arrived at 2 pm. Only stayed 4 hours as I had to go to Alexandria by 6 pm train. Reached Alexandria at 10.30 pm and drove to the "Windsor" Hotel where I stayed the night. The following day
14th I paid a visit to Sidi Gabir and Mustapha Barracks, returning to Ismailia by 4 pm train. At Benha I changed trains and the Ismailia train was literally packed with men returning from Cairo on the expiration of their 48 hours leave. 11.40 saw us at Ismail, the train being 1 hour 40 minutes late.
15th Changed my abode and am now living in a nice little house adjacent
