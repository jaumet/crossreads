Another inclement day but fortunately a little finer. Went down to "D" Co who are quite a step down the road. Saw Groves and the others but everyone is loafing about under the influence of nothing to do and all day to do it in. Afternoon some home mail came. Two football matches played in wet grassy fields hedge surrounded and forming a bleak looking picture. Shall not be sorry when moving day comes and takes us away from here.

At 2.15 went down to the village and attended a meeting of all Bde. officers under presidency of General Rosenthal. Talk about Charleroi. Had afternoon tea with the General Colonels James and Savage. After mess attended a meeting of mess and then an A Co concert.
