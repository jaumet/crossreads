to have their clothing issued out to us, it is only natural that we should like our own distinctive uniforms best, all like to look like Australians, you should hear the men performing swearing some of them refuse to have anything at all to do with it, they prefer to wear their old Australian uniforms, till it almost falls off their backs rather than wear the English uniform quite right. I fail to see why they can't keep the supply up to us, rather than let it go to some of the shoddy manufacturers contractors in England from what I have seen of the various manufactured articles during this war, well Australian goods have nothing to fear by comparison if a line can be drawn from such articles
