<p>O.A.S.<br/>Sunday 4.2.17</p>
<p>My dear Judge,</p>
<p>Your letter of Dec 10th to hand last Sunday. At that time I was spending three days with one of our field batteries &ndash; to learn something about gunnery &amp; also as part of a liaison scheme whereby cooperation between aircraft &amp; artillery will proceed on more sympathetic lines. Strangely enough, &amp; by pure chance, I went to the battery in which is Theo Thompson, eldest son of J.A. Thompson (the Solicitor) in Sydney. I have known him for a good many years &amp; he is one of the very few fellows from Sydney whom I have chanced upon since I came to England. During my stay there I had an afternoon in the front line trenches; it was interesting &amp; also absolutely quiet; the same evening I was under shell fire at the battery for 1&frac12; hours immediately on our return. The Hun put over about 250 rounds mostly 5.9's with lachrymatory gas. We were pretty safe in dugouts &amp; no one was hurt; damage to battery also practically nil, but the gas made our eyes smart &amp; gave us nasty headaches which lasted well into the following day. To me it was an extremely interesting experience &ndash; the sort of thing probably that will become fairly common when the push starts.</p>
