<p>July 1915<br/>Friday 9<br/>Fine Windy. Went aboard <u>HMS. Bacchante</u> with some companions and was shown round the Engine Room by one of the sailors. They gave us tea and made us feel at home. They invited us over on Sunday when I could look over the guns and torpedoe tubes.</p>
<p>Saturday 10<br/>Windy. Horses, lorries and Ambulance wagons landed this morning.</p>
