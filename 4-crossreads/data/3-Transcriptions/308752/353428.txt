<p>rudely awakened, Fritz started shelling the village &amp; things were only middling, every minute I expected the building to come crashing down on top of us, the d--- things were bursting all over the place, &amp; the noise was deafening. Our good luck still remained, &amp; we all thank God with all our hearts for our safety. The only sensible thing we could do was to put our heads under the blankets. The bombardment only lasted about half an hour. Just think what I must be like when the British bombard the enemy for days at a time, it is no wonder that he has to retreat. One of our cases yesterday was a wounded Fritz he was some weight, being a long way over 6 feet high. Our carries will not be so long in future, a horse Ambulance is stationed about a mile from us. This just shows how quickly the roads are being <strike>repa prepared.Of course</strike> prepared. Of course there is no trench fighting just now, open country &amp; village fighting. Fritz cannot be compared with our fellows in this style of fighting. I often wonder how the other Bearers are faring, B, &amp; C, Sections, we left them over 6 weeks ago, to work at the Rest Station, they have been in the Straffe all this time. The Infantry are marvellous how they still keep going.</p>
