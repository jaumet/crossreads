July 29, 30Night, a sullen day of haze and stillness ended:  working on M.G. Dispositions.
July 30288.Today has been like the last day of the term at school:  mid-morning brought word of an early move, and the order to cut down for mobile transporting.
A hot sun-haze day.
From T.B.C. a sketch book:  tonight with it to Hondeghem but nothing done.
At the Farmhouse yarning to some of the Gordons:  they tell of a second Etarples "M.P." stunt, at Calais.
Tom last night told the tale of our stunt at Hondeg., two months back.  Kilts, bare knees, Aussy hats, dust and stoush.
An Aussy sights the A.P.M.,"Have you seen the new star?"   A swing and a mark, "-well sort it out of those!"
Merris circled again last night by the 10th and a baging of prisoners and material, 4 officers, 165 O.R., 10 ps.  From the noise of the guns, a counter attack.
July 31289.After all our swimming the pool's kept its cleanness:  today the Jocks newly arrived discovered it, and tonight, no swimming.  A hundred paddlers and splashers have churned it to muddiness and tangled weeds.
In the afternoon they kept a long unending stream to its banks and from it, and stripped of their kilts they lost their apparent beauty of build.  With kilts well girt and beribboned hose-tops, and tanned knees and faces, they are good to see:  but in the sun stripped of their uniforms their beauty is gone.  And naked, they are even more modest than the posing Venus de Milo, one wore full bathing costume.
Tonight to H.:  an hour yarning to two S.A.s:  they in clink awaiting D.C.M., for desertion.  One, in his short kilt knickers and loose open shirt, a lad of fine black haired bronze, and full of splendid movement.
