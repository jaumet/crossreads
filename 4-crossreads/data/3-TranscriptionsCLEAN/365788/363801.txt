  
 This is Sunday  Morning & I have just been to Church Parade & Holy Communion & thought of you all & sent up a Prayer for you all. Will you please ask Arch  to send me a statement showing how I stand, & ask him to give Fred Sherwin my address & please ring up Miss Rossitter & tell her of my new address & ask her to tell Beatrice Glasson. We hear that Rommania  & Bulgaria are at war. Very much love dear old Girl to you all & Kisses to the [indecipherable]. Your loving Brotheer Fred
