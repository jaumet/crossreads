October 1916which is now razed to the ground & covered with shell holes, & dead bodies are lying about everywhere.  This place was in German hands about 10 days ago & signs of fighting are still fresh.  While we were cutting up a German Machine Gun Belt one of Fritz's shells came across & landed about 30 yds from us, followed closely by two more.  We were showered with a heap of mud & after the third one, thought it time to "git."Coming back we passed a great number of batteries who were barking furiously at Fritz, & we arrived home in time for dinner.
