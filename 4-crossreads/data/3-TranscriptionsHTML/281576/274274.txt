<p>Mon. Sept. 17.  Left Racquingham.  Last night we slept in the Orderly Room.  Stan Wright &amp; a few more of us.  We turned out at 6, &amp; got ready for the Road.  Left Racq. about 9  &amp; marched about a mile along the Road till we joined up the Rest of our Brigade.  It was quite a warm day &amp; the Juice ran pretty freely.  We tried a new idea on this march, forming ourselves into Gun Teams.  Instead of carrying our Gear on our Backs, we loaded it on Spiders &amp; hauled it along.  "Shag" Miles, Woodsy, were among my Team &amp; they were real good Haulers.  On the Road, Miles &amp; I dropped out to find the "correct Time".  Before we started on the march I dashed down to the Photogrs  &amp; got the remainder of the Photos.  Arrived Steenvoord about 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Steenvoorde<br/>Tues. Sept. 18.  Last night I slept next to Billgy May, on the cold hard floor of the Barn.  Luckily there was plenty of straw.  We left the Farm, where we billeted immediately after Break. &amp; marched through Poperinghe where our Nursing Section have taken over the D.R.S.  The Bearers were soon set to work, sorting out poles &amp; Tents &amp; pitching  them.</p>
