sea running seasickness soon held full sway & many a good soldier cared not for King & CountryThis is my first time at sea but felt no sign of sickness except for a few minutes while in one of the holds helping the Q.M.S to issue blankets As night fell the sea got worse also the sickness. Things were cold & wet on deck so that soon after dark I faced going below got my hammock up & after a few experiments got settled into it most comfortably. But then the trouble started as soon as I closed my eyes it felt as if the old Boat stood straight up first on one end then the other with eyes open it was all right. However I was dead tired & before long was fast asleep & knew nothing more untill Revallie this morning What a place to awaken in. The Port holes & Hatch had been closed
