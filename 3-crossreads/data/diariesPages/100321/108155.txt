24/1/19 Gourdinne
Sixty good men and true moved out this morning under the care of C.S.M. Reggie Day D.C.M.M.M. Headed by the band they looked very well indeed. Just after their departure came in the General who had walked over. Showed him our Pozieres plate and had a yarn with him ? touching for one thing on a proposed amalgamation of the 23rd. with us. Owing the drafts leaving our Band has become steadily weaker and weaker but can still knock out a tune. Gorman has practically finished his history. Cold raw afternoon. I walked round the outskirts and round the woods about the village and came back glowing. Ration strength now 320. Had a yarn, a cup of coffee and some pancakes with Mere Crochelet.
