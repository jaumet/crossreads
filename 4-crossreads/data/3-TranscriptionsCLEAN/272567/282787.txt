26/11/18 BohainIt was dark at 6.15 when Charlesworth called me but daylight grew during shaving time. A dull day but fine and the sun will likely shine out later. Breakfasted at 7 am and all the signs symptoms and evidences of moving day were about. Men running round with packs and other gear and everyone busy & restless. Not having moved in route march for some time as a Brigade it will be rather interesting to see today how long different sized columns take to pass certain points. The present strengths of Bns are about 22nd 530  23rd 560  24th 870. No rations have come to hand  and the troops are only rationed up to tonight owing to a mine having blown up the railway line somewhere near Cambrai. Hislop Bde Bomb Officer is a good youth with plenty of sense.
