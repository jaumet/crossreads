 Thursday 12th July 1917 Fouffin-Ricametz Reveille 6am. Had breakfast, then started to fill nose bags hay nets as I am stable-man for the day. Dinner 12 noon. "Donks" went to water at 11.30am did not return till about 2.30pm. Had one da spell here. Plenty of current bushes in the grounds, but not very many left when we'd finished.
