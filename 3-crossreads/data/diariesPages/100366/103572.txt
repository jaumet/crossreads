 
I was well satisfied with my sojourn in the trench & returned sadder & wiser than before.

29.9.16 Friday

The rain commenced again today but did not set in, although it is still rather dull with a cold wind blowing. Great success has been attained on the Somme & the British have now thrown the Germans back from the Ridge which the whole world thought impregnable.

There is a big artillery battle being waged here on the Ypres Sector right through to the Coast. I do not know what it means, as general opinion has it that there will be no infantry attacks here, but judging by the fierce artillery fire there is something doing. I heard however that that it is to prevent the Germans withdrawing men for the Somme front. My cold has loosened & I hope to shake it off completely by tomorrow, Everything is bustle in this region now to make preparations for the oncoming winter. I have had un-official orders that my Supply Section will have to move up in closer proximity to the trenches, which is no bar for me.

Everyone is looking forward to further developements in the Somme area & before long the whole front may be ablaze from end to end.
