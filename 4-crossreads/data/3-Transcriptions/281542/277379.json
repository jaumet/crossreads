<p>[Paragraph of shorthand crossed through.}</p>
<p>Saturday 2nd Oct. 1915</p>
<p>Warm weather has prevailed during the last 3 or 4 days, with heavy fogs early morning.  Flies are terrific.  The evenings are pleasant, calm &amp; quiet, with an unchanging canopy of stars in a <strike>violent</strike> violet sky.</p>
<p>Warmly congratulated today by [indecipherable] Captain Richmond on my ability as a typist and he said my work was like the skill of an extra [indecipherable].  Rare compliments indeed.</p>
<p>Major Pinwill's trip to [indecipherable] has been postponed:  he leaves tomorrow however.</p>
<p>Major [indecipherable] is off again on Monday on some special "stunt", I believe to Helles.</p>
<p>The Turks have been very active during the last 3 or 4 days with their artillery and their anti aircraft guns especially have caused our machines some anxiety.</p>
<p>The Turks are indefatigable workers:  whether they are driven to it at the point of the revolver I do not know:  but it is a fact that they can convert a barren position in a night into a nest of trenches and covers.  My belief is that they have special "digging" Bns.</p>
<p>Their snipers too are remarkable:  they are in every conceivable nook and cranny and it is difficult at times to realise how they live in such positions as they are found.  They are a harassing factor in the operations of our fatigue parties by day and night.</p>

<p>Wrote Mab. letter.</p>
<p>Major Pinwill goes to [indecipherable].</p>
<p>Monday 4th Oct. 1915</p>
<p>Received letters from Mab. (11 Aug.) Grace (7th &amp; 19th Aug.) Gran (18th Aug.).  Welcome news.  General Godley goes to Mudros to inspect the troops.  The Turks broke the ice this morning with a demonstration on Apex about 9 o'clock.  Fairly heavy rifle and machine gun fire whilst a few shells burst over our lines.  It lasted for about &frac12; hour.  Our fellows report that they did not see a Turk who kept behind their trenches.</p>
<p>Sent Field Service Cards in ack. of above letters.</p>
