Monday Sept 28I put in a good day on Sunday  -  First there was our bathing party  -  Then breakfast  -  After breakfast I got leave & went ashore with Patterson of the Engineers  -  We walked up to the Governors residence  -  P  -  wanted to inspect the engine at the wireless station  -  It was very hot going up - very hot indeed but quite dry  -  Once on the top we got the breeze  -  What a splendid view of the harbour & surrounding country  -  Every war boat was in the harbour lying peacefully at anchor  -
I went all over the Governor's residence - much of the furniture was leather - very unsuitable in the tropics  -  I also noticed a great deficiency of French windows  -  Just the ordinary sash window  -  That's a defect in this hot climate  -  Thick matting covered most of the floors  -  I was shown some damage done to the furniture by the Tommies when they first took charge  -  It didn't amount to much after all said & done & where were the officers - Commissioned & non coms to allow any damage at all?
