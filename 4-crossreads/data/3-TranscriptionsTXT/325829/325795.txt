And it was with a great deal of regret that the troops left, what promised to be quite a home, for the stagnant heat of the Jordan valley, reaching Jericho on the evening of the 22nd. On the following day the Regt marched to Wadi Mellahah, &amp; it took over a sector from the 9th Regt Hodson's Horse. Two Squadrons "B &amp; C" took over front line with "A" Sqdn in reserve, led horses being sent back 2 miles to the rear of outpost line. Working parties were then detailed to deepen &amp; improve trenches and to complete wiring. The enemy opened up from the direction of Red Hill with a heavy gun, but did no damage. One Gun of "A" Battery H.A.C. moved up to Regt Hdqs &amp; shelled the enemy's position at intervals during the day. On the 27th Inst The Enemy's Artillery was very active from the direction of Red Hill, shells bursting towards the [Wadi] Auja. Later a party of the enemy approached to within 700 yards of "Star" left post of sector &amp; after firing a few bursts from a machine gun withdrew. Still later another party of enemy about 50 strong with two Automatic rifles approached within about 700 yards &amp; commenced firing in the direction of Tea Post occupied by 6th L.H. Regt. 
 Two red &amp; two greed flares were sent up by this party &amp; soon afterwards the enemy artillery opened up on our posts. A few shells fell in the horse lines of Regt Hdqrs. No casualties resulting.
