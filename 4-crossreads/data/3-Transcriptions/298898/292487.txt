<p>heavy guns going forward of all descriptions the tractors etc. passing this place at all hours in fact great activity is being shewn in the transport line a very good sign indeed &amp; we hear daily of batteries being moved higher up. Sitting in this room of mine at night I can easily imagine myself back in London when I hear the motors pass, it sounds for all the world like the London busses &amp; taxis passing, the tooting etc. bringing thoughts of London to me everytime I hear it. Expect to move out any day now as the relief has arrived. I am quite ready as I handed over two days ago to the 15th. I believe the 2nd Field will be taking our place which is not quite so healthy since the shells started to come. Much distressed at the lack of mail, delayed no doubt by recent events it will be quite 3 months old by the time we get it now. Malish! Am now reading S. Pepys diary &amp; enjoy it well</p>
