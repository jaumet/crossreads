<p>yelling.  I was excited myself &amp; practically ran all the way home to break the news &amp; then a lot of them wouldn't believe me in fact I could hardly believe it myself but it seems to be true.  As I write this the bands are playing "Apre la guerre fini", &amp; a lot of old tunes while I believe down in Warminster there were great scenes of excitement, but I suppose one will have to wait in patience till the morning papers come, we will know the full strength of things then &amp; then only.</p>
<p>14th.  What a sell not a word scarcely in the papers about Peace this morning.  I'll bet I won't be had so easily the next time such rumours come through I was that sure of it last night that I would have wagered any money that it was true.  I'll be a bit more cautious next time believe me.<br/>Raining again this morning.  Storey &amp; I had an early breakfast then went down to No. 7 Camp to report.  Here we found them calling the roll before</p>
