<p>Contrast in Treatment-<br/> 10.11.19</p>
<p>Melbourne, Sunday &ndash; The Commonwealth Defence authorities are now giving publicity to the statements of individual repatriated Australian prisoners of war concerning their treatment in Germany.</p>
<p>The stories told by the soldiers of their sufferings, and the brutal methods adopted towards them by their captors, constitute in the main a most damning indictment of German inhumanity.</p>
<p>In striding contrast to the statements of Australian prisoners, concerning their treatment in German internment camps, is a report by the Acting-Consul for Switzerland in Australia of the conditions prevailing at the German Concentration Camp at Holsworthy, New South Wales.  The Swiss Consul, after visiting the camp on behalf of the German Government on September 26, 1918, reported in the highest terms on the treatment extended to the internees and the general camp arrangements.  His report to the German Government on the result of his visit to the camp has been incorporated by the Defence Department in the booklet exposing the manner in which the Germans treated Australian prisoners of war.</p>
