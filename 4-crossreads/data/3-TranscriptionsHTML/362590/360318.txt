<p>4th Bn A.I.F.<br/>Tel-el-Kebir<br/>Egypt</p>
<p>4.2.16<br/>Dear Judge</p>
<p>I am afraid I have been most discourteous in my letter writing to you &ndash; which is a very poor return for all your kindness in writing &amp; sending me papers. But you must really forgive me. My time is not my own.</p>
<p>My third visit to Anzac did not end so disastrously for me as after the landing &amp; Lone Pine &ndash; &amp; was short but full of the incident. I wrote you a hurried note from there. I was pretty busy getting my Bn out of Reserve &amp; into the Fire Trenches when I got back. Then came the preparations for the evacuation, &amp; finally the evacuation itself.</p>
<p>It was with very mixed feelings that I left Anzac. Relief at the prospect of a rest, after the strain of the last few days when our line was so thin &ndash; but oh! the gallant men we left behind. But they made the great sacrifice, &amp; one can say no more.</p>
<p>Now that the Peninsula has been completely evacuated, it can do no more harm to let you know some of the cases that were carried out, &amp; which helped to bluff the Turks. Some 15 days before the evacuation, orders were received that not a shot was to be fired for 3 days (unless heavily attacked). This was done &amp; had friend Abdul</p>
