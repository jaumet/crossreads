 Bulford 1-8-17 Dear Mum, Your 2 letters of the 21st &amp; 27th May have just arrived &amp; were the first letters for 5 weeks.  Lots of Your mail &amp; also ours has gone down thanks to Fritz's Submarines so You must not worry if You don't get any mail for month's. About under-pants mum, I asked Bess to help You make some for me.  I think You have a pattern.  I have 2 pairs to make up but I am always doing something.  I go out twice a week from 12 noon &amp; am always on Duty 2 nights a week.  One night for washing my clothes, &amp; I always go &amp; play for Service at the Y.M.C.A. on Wednesday.  I have one night to write letters &amp; sew.  I have to go out to the Y.M.C.A. to-night.
