<p>spies.  I musen't say much, but some were caught around us after the raids.  When you read Phillip Gibbs took on "The Soul of the war it's difficult to put two and two together.</p>
<p>This is a very horrid letter for you this time.  Please blame the horrid things that have been happening.  Then think of the planes we have now. And rest assured like I do that we'll not have such a bad time again.</p>
<p>This is a nice bit of news &ndash; Miss Wilson has been made Matron-in-Chief for 6 months during Miss Conyers absence to Australia. We [indecipherable] are delighted about it.</p>
<p>Sept 18th  There is no more news so I'll close again with very much love to you all.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours<br/>Anne Donnell</p>
