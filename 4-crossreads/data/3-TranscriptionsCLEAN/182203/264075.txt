  
 He is still at Wandsworth Hospital but expects to leave there on Tuesday. His wound is nearly healed & most likely will have a couple of months leave - so is hoping his wife will come in the next few days.  Went to a very grand place for luncheon - then went to a matinee "Peg O' my Heart" & it is the prettiest little play I've ever seen. We both enjoyed it immensely. It was over about 5. p.m. then we got into a Taxi & went to a most beautiful place for afternoon tea The Torcodero? They are called the Concert Teas, some  Swank . The music was beautiful    & the whole affair was just what I love, oh, if only my boy was here to take me - I know it is just what he likes. Capt. had to get back by 7. p.m. so he put me into the train at 6.15. p.m. & would have a rush to get to his Hospital by then.
