21/5/17 Bouzincourt
The Battalion formed up on its fine little parade ground just near the back of the billets being played out by the band. Everywhere the eye looks there is restful green and lovely sprays of fruit blossom. Dark clouds were hanging round and warm showers started to fall forcing us to continue the parade indoors. Musketry lectures were the rule Lewis gunners and signallers hard at work under their officers. Thwaites has failed to return from Amiens ? some of these chaps won't play the game at all. In the afternoon went on parade again on the same ground for a good deal of close order drill and bayonet fighting. There is a subterranean tunnel running under this place from the Church and we hear rumours of one leading as far as Thiepval. In Albert are many refuges underground. Near Bapaume the Germans used an old subterranean passage running along a good distance.
