<p>10 &ndash; should like photographs of you all. I feel I may not be home for many months yet unless of course I get ill &ndash; but I hope not to do that till anyway the war is over.<br/>I'd love a print of gum trees something to hang up in my tent. I really need very little. The clothes, riding skirt &amp; I suppose my brown boots went down in some ship for I never received them &amp; Jocelyn says she sent them. I need boots &ndash; most of all &ndash; would you ask Callaghan to make me a black pair of calf leather like they made me when I left in May last year &ndash; thick soles. Mr Robin knows how I like them &ndash; also a pair of calf shoes &ndash; black &ndash; the same as he always make <u>not on any account to try and put patent leather toe caps on.</u></p>
