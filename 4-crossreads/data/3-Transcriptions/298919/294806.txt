<p><u>Tuesday 13th July.</u>  At 4pm ship was shifted from Victoria Dock to R.A. dry dock.  After tea I went ashore &amp; went to the Garrick where Oh be Careful was played.  Play not brilliant.<br/><u>Wednesday 14th July 1915.</u>  By this morning the dock had been pumped quite dry and we were able to go down and underneath the ship.  She was very dirty being covered with grass and barnacles.  After tea 4th &amp; Self went ashore.
