<p>Saturday 3 February 1917</p>
<p>Another mine washed up on the Beach, it looks like a big 3 legged POT turned upside down &ndash; the legs are the percussion caps to be touched by boats &amp; then exploded &ndash; A machine gun was played on this &amp; up it went.</p>
<p>Nearly full moon &amp; at 12.30 I turned out ranks just as a Plane flew over but no bombs were dropped &ndash; It gets on the nerves of some of the troops &amp; they cannot sleep, personally I worry not KISMET.</p>
