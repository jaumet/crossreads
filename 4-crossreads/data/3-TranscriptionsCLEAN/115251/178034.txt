  
 13th November 
 Dear Col. Wallack; This will serve to introduce to you, Herr Wilhelm Wostrack, German Resident Commissioner of Nauru, who was taken Prisoner by me along with twenty-five (25) others on 6th instant. 
 Herr Wostrack has been on parole since leaving Nauru, and I trust, in view of the high office he held and the assistance he has given me, that the same consideration may be extended to him by you on his arrival in Sydney.  He is accompanied  also by his Wife. 
 With kindest regards. 
 Colonel. Administrator. 
 Colonel E.T. Wallack, C.B. District Commander, Sydney.
