 24 May 1918 Friday Empire Day Hebron Road Camp Not many remember the "Empire Day"-   We are out of the Firing Line but the Duties are very heavy on the men, also Fatigues   Jim Ayre was in my "Bivy" last night he is fit  again  Still busy developing "Pontius Pilates" old water ways for our horses   We use 2 modern oil engines to pump from the old wells. The "maiden Fern" I send you in this grows from the rocks of the roofs- I see "Fife &amp; Drum" in an old "Pastoralists Review" asks "Will we have races in Jerusalem?"  Well, we have to clear away the stones to take our Horses to WATER, let alone to a RACECOURSE
