Headquarters, and if I ever meet Pat over here I shall of course, take him there personally. You will notice that two of the men from Terry's battery have been buried with him, I am afraid that was unavoidable in those trying days as everything was so frightfully disorganised.  The other names are 1997 Sgt M [Michael] McFerran and 3604 Bombardier G [Gordon Henry] Iles, both of the 37th Battery, 10th Field Artillery Brigade.
