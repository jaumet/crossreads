<p>8 March 1915<br/>Monday 20 wks from home</p>
<p>Revielle at 6<br/>After first parade I had another trip to Cairo with the C.O. &amp; got back at 1 pm for lunch. Our boots hob nailed came to hand today &amp; they are awful. I promptly pulled mine out. Sgt Metcher went to Mena to try &amp; get his brother into the Troop, he came back at 6 &amp; had fairly good luck. The corp went for their weekly wash. Another beastly day &amp; nothing but dust. We heard that the mail is expected tomorrow or Thur I hope to goodness that its true. Tomorrow is another large day &amp; we are to be the white force, &amp; to move out at 7.30 am. The W.L. came over again today for WT instruction but they don't seem too [indecipherable] for it &amp; don't intend to take it with them. The reinforcements are due to arrive on camp any day. Bed at 9.30<br/>9 March 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>Revielle at 5.30<br/>We marched out at 7.30 in column by way of the Suez Canal on to the 3rd Tower, on the way out we passed the Inf  cookers returning to camp after bivouacing. We were the White force &amp; the N.L. were the Blue. Well we made an attack or an advance from No. 5 Tower to El Marg but the enemy were holding a position SE of the [indecipherable] station. Two regs were sent out to engage &amp; dislodge them but they proved too strong &amp; we had to retire. The reserves were sent up &amp; they held the enemy meanwhile a reg of enemy by a brilliant right flank movement came right in on our left shot all the horses to pieces as well as threatening our rear our arty being useless. When the umpires saw this they ordered the "Stand Fast", we having lost the day [indecipherable] should have forced through got back at 2.30. Bed at 9</p>
