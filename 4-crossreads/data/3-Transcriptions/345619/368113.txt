<p>Isn't this a nice place? I have got some more pretty cards to send you from Cornwall &amp; hope you like them. We went to a Childrens Service yesterday and it was real nice, all the little girls &amp; boys were singing. Some of them were smaller than Frank. lots of love from Dad<br/>XXXXXXXXXX</p>
