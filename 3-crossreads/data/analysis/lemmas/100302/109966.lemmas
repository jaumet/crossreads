Have locat it stabl the Sergeant Major ( Yeadon ) and a coupl of kindr spirit set out with a strong solut of permang of potash . Gain access to the stabl they transform the hors 's white coat into a bay one and then decamp . The owner evid heard some nois but mere close the top half of the stabl door and then went away again . The effect of the dye was extraordinari ? one coat is insuffici and the hors now is skebald . Be restiv , it head and leg stay their origin colour ! !
