<p>24 May 1918 Friday Empire Day<br/>Hebron Road Camp<br/>Not many remember the "Empire Day"-   We are out of the Firing Line but the Duties are very heavy on the men, also Fatigues   Jim Ayre was in my "Bivy" last night he is fit <strike>again</strike><br/>Still busy developing "Pontius Pilates" old water ways for our horses   We use 2 modern oil engines to pump from the old wells.<br/>The "maiden Fern" I send you in this grows from the rocks of the roofs-<br/>I see "Fife &amp; Drum" in an old "Pastoralists Review" asks "Will we have races in Jerusalem?"  Well, we have to clear away the stones to take our Horses to WATER, let alone to a RACECOURSE</p>
