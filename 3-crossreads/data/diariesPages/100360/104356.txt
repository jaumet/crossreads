Tues. Mar. 27. Yesterday wrote Lill & today to Mother & Arthur David. Wet, windy day.

Wed. 28. Hospital ship "Asturias" sunk by the Huns. Another wet day.

Thur. 29. Still got the Huns on the move.

Fri. Mar. 30th Went into Albert with Billy Williams & had a good look round the Town. Quite a number of civilians have returned & the place is looking quite civilised. Got Letter from Ruth B.

Sat. Mar. 31 Some H.Q. Staff has moved into Albert & the Town is full of Red Caps. One has to be careful about saluting these days.
