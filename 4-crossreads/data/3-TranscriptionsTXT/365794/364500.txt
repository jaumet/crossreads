 Monday 8th April 1917 [1918] Again Monday is round and a whole have I lain in this little bed.  I feel much better &amp; except for the cough very little trace of diph.  With a swollen arm Cholera inj. &amp; a recurring rash on abd. (anti diph. serum 4000 units) am a sorry sight. My M.O. comes daily 10 a.m. &amp; is made of wood, nothing human in his makeup.  One wonders where these so called men came from &amp; where they will get to "after the war". Crowds of Bulletins &amp; "Couriers" come to cheer me up &amp; books in plenty of sorts. Note at end of 3 wks. re M.O.  He is a gentleman &amp; perhaps were I less reserved &amp; nervous he would be less cool.  He has been very considerate.
