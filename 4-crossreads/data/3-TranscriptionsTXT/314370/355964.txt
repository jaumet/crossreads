January, 1916Monday 10A lot more Machine Gunners expected in some time today & I am told I will have to take a class.About 5 pm they arrive in hundreds & the work of putting them into tents & getting them some grub took up several hours.They are in a bad way in regards to clothing & money.
Tuesday 11I am given a squad of 20 men from the 6th  Bde M.G. Secs.The first day is very trying  But after getting into the swing of things it comes quite easily.
