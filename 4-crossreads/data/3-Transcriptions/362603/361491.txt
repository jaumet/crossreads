<p>for a row on the River.  It was a perfect day &amp; I had a grand time.  There were 2 other "Ozzie's" and masel'.   All Australians over here are called "Ozzie's."

I just go when &amp; I like &amp; as often as I like &amp; have a "Home from Home."<br/>Give my Regards to the Neighbours &amp; to All enquiring Friends especially Mrs Dobson, Ali &amp; Stephen &amp; the Parks.<br/>Best of Love to You All from<br/>Harry XXX</p>
