<p>work whatever at Anzac, simply went up there, prepared a Hospital spending about 5 weeks there &amp; then returned to Semnos. The evacuation of certain points of the peninsular now seems to be going on. Not only troops are being removed but stores &amp; ammunition as well &amp; old trenches etc. being mined along with the idea of checking the Turks advance. Piers are being built along the beach to facilitate the embarkation. Should this take place one wonders what effect it will have on our prestige. Perhaps they have a better plan. I hope so for the sake of the spirit &amp; morale of the troops. Time will tell.<br/>Wednesday 15th. More troops arriving from Anzac daily &amp; things must be now coming to a head. After duty I went to the 1st A.S.H. &amp; interviewed the O.C.  I asked him his opinion of my transfer &amp; he said he would be very pleased to have me but he was unable to give me the rank immediately &amp; I told me that I fancied that that would be the stumbling block. I returned home &amp; thought it over. More yarns about the evacuation. One subject</p>
