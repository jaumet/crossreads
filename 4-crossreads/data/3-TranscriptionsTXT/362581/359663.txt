My darling Eddy,
Your letters were really wonderful this week   &  I'm so pleased to hear that you like school so much. Suppose you will be playing football   &  cricket by the time I Come home. Suppose the boys are all good mates.You must write   &  tell me all about your School. Must write to Auntie Bell next for her birthday.  Fondest love   &  kisses.From Auntie Eadle
