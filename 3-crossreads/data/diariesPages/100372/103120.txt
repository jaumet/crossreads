have received better treatment. In addition to three hot meals a day provided by the Mil.[itary] Authorities, at almost every stn we stopped at, the Red Cross ladies met us & provided us with tea, scones, fruit etc. Not the least pleasing of all was the sight of our own Austn girls. We who had been in Palestine had seen practically nothing of the English speaking world save our soldiers in Khaki & it was truly a feast for the eye, the ear & the spirit. To look & to listen was a treat & I think everybody thought that "all the world over theres no place like home". Changing at Albury we got sleepers & even though the hour was midnight, those who were awake were met by Red Cross workers & at daylight in the morning, they also were there. I slept like a top, both nights & at 4.30am on the 27th was quite ready to get up preparatory changing trains at Wfarra. We stopped at Sydney for about an hour but were not allowed off the platform. However by dint of persuasion & palm grease I persuaded a porter to enquire of the C.S.M. Sydney if there was a wire for me & he brought one from Aunt Jack saying all were meeting us at Central. From Wfarra to Centl every house we passed within sight of , waved a flag or sheet or something to greet us. Our arms got tired of responding, so a newspaper held outside & blowing in the wind sufficed.
