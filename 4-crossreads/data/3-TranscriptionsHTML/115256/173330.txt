<p>Friday 12 March 1915</p>
<p>Reveille at 5 a.m. this morning, and by 7 o'clock the brigade had moved off to take part in a divisional exercise which was the embodiment of some intelligent person's fanciful idea.  The general idea is this, roughly:  A khaki state, in violation of a treaty with a "white state", desires to encroach on certain oil wells, belonging to the latter party.  After all its endeavours for peace have proved to be fruitless, the "white state" decides to defend its right and the treaty by force of arms.  It therefore mobolises in haste and takes up a defensive position in an excellent praiseworthy manner.  Meanwhile the "khaki force" consisting of the whole division <u>less</u> the howitzer battery, pushes forward, the commander knowing that only a small number of the enemy could be mobolised at such short notice.  This forecast is confirmed by our scouts who discover that the enemy's strength is about four guns, a few cavalry, and a brigade of infantry.  At any rate after a long, tiring march, we came to grips with the foe.  But there was no sting in our attack (our march had been too severe), and the East Lancashire "Terriers", our enemy, had entrenched themselves in such excellent positions that it was inevitable that they should win the day.  So after a strenuous day of nearly twelve hours' duration, we returned to camp a little after six.</p>
