 Fine, came on to rain in evening Rode round Piccadilly with father in morning and Joan & Linda & I went up to Ben Ledi after we had a look at our names carved on the tree in Ben Ledi Father, Joan, Linda & Self left in Lawrence's car for Quirindi at 1.20 pm & got into Quirindi about 3 oclock. Father went back about 5 oclock & we had dinner at Fogarty's & Eric Cadell came & had it with us. Lay on the verandah till the train went Bill Storey was with us. Got berths in 11.30 & had a good trip down. Cant realise yet that I have left home for a long time & that it may be years before I see the place again. Father did not like going home by himself a bit to an empty house. Think the trip did Linda a great lot of good, but wish we had struck cool weather
