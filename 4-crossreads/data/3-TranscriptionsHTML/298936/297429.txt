<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Thursday 30</p>
<p>On camp fatigue.</p>
<p>All that required to be done was carrying water &amp; rations. Getting used to being under fire although when a shrapnel comes rather close it gives one a bit of a fright.</p>
<p>Several aeroplanes mostly our own overhead during the day observing for the warships firing over to the Turkish lines.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see the shells fired by the Turks bursting near the shore (sometimes).</p>
<p>They are not very successful at that kind of firing.</p>
