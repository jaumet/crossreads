  
 but as he was fresh from Australia he had to be shown everything, then there was the operating theatre, Gas room, sick room, ordinary duties, evacuations, requisitions to battalions stocking the A.D.S. & a dozen other things to be done so that between the lot I had plenty of running about to do.   As I always feel better & happier when busy I was well satisfied with things.   Weather very cold, well below freezing point.   I have a good dugout with the W.O. & it will be most comfortable when I get it fixed up with my photos etc on the wall. 
 Friday 1st Feb    Managed to get things fairly straight today but had very busy time fixing up requisitions etc.   Had very few cases through only one wounded man but several sick.   Weather very cold, heavy frost all day.   Hopped into my mail at night & polished off six letters before going to bed.
