<p>about 7 week's in which time I moved into about 3 different wards.  At this place I had an operation which I soon got over.</p>
<p>I may say at this hospital we had a lot more leave than we did at Leicester, and besides the sisters being Australian understood our way's.</p>
<p>I had a real good time at Southall during my stay, besides making a few friend's and any way I was real sorry to leave it.</p>
<p>From Southall I went on my furlough, which I had being praying for.</p>
