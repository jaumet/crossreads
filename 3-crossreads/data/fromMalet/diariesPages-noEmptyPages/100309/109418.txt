26/6/17 Beaulencourt
By 7.45 the battalion swung out in column of route to the sound of a rousing march from the band. Jumped off at 9 a.m. in an attack on Villers-au Flos which was defended by the 24th Battalion and everything went well. Afterwards at a conference of officers Colonel Watson myself discussed the operation and the General said that to his mind the attack was excellently organised delivered. "Praise from Sir Rupert is praise indeed!" Returned to camp at noon and rested most of the afternoon. After formal mess at which the band again performed, Evans gave a lecture on Transport. Spent the evening with Leon Barbier and conversed for nearly  hour in French ? at least no English was used in the discussion and we covered many topics. Our regimental band is improving very fast. A Taube was over tonight and one battery of archies did some good shooting. Otherwise all quiet. Delightful mild evenings a healthy life this with abundance of fresh air.
