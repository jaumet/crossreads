Some of our engineers and some American engineers stood about and when I'd asked them a question or two they told me the place was unhealthy; that Jerry had just ceased shelling and no one could say when he'd re-commence. It was a wild goose chase and made me reflect on how little the army uses its brains. They might as well have had a sign up "Here we are" and then seek to correct it by putting up another "We're not here now".

So, all day long I've been stretching canvases and in spite of fatigue and painful stiffness I've had a good day: tomorrow, if it's fine, I'll have a better one. We have the</p>
