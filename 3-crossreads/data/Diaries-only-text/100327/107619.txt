At 2045 a verbal report from A Co "Gas on our right". Phoned them to verify and received message in confirmation. Collared helmet (gas) and respirator. Received message gas was emitted from bomb. Reported to Brigade. Went up to have a look at it with Major Smith. Shortly after leaving Reg office a sweetish smell (not unpleasant) became noticeable ? something like rodoform. Reached firing line and passed on to A Co. all men there looking like divers with their heads covered with gas helmets and respirators. Some of the "nuts" said they had lost their respirators or could not find them and consequently thought of the alternative of the sock drenched in u. Some had socks they had been wearing continuously for weeks soaked in the liquid and plastered over mouths. A desperate remedy but it worked all right. Others complained that though they could produce the sock they could not produce the other necessary not being able to rise to the occasion.
Reached spot where donning of our helmets and respirators became imperative. Sweet smell overpowering and dreadful irritation to eyes which felt as if being burnt out, ears almost bursting, knees weak. Went right in under blankets put up as usual by spraying squad but their antidote did not seem very effective as the gas slowly spent itself. Searched for bomb case but could not find it. Almost overpowered had to retreat and took a while to recover. 2 men laid out. Later on recovered bomb case and the gas slowly dispersed. Eyes very much affected unable to sleep for over an hour
