  
 two Sisters who got the R.R.R. of the old C.C.S.    we were attached .  We (Dot   &  I) got back in time to go on duty at 10 p.m. Had a great dinner   &  it was very jolly, though a    Hen affair  . 
 Shall write a longer letter when I receive any from home. It is a beastly night - lightening   &  thunder. 
 Must stop now. Fondest love   &  kisses to you all 
 XO  From   XX X Yours lovingly O Edith XOXOXOXOX
