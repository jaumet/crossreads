 come out on to the balcony of the next building hawling wardrobes, bedding and other household things suitable for burning and threw them over the balcony on to the street below, where another fire had been begun. They seemed to be as calm and collected as if they were doing an ordinary days work under ordinary conditions. In fact after they had thrown a large number of things over in this way one of the soldiers had the audacity, in spite of the fact that the flames were beginning to mount higher and higher and volumes of smoke were pouring forth from the windows, to give a speech to the huge crowd which had gathered. The smoke and the flames became too much for them and they left the balcony but still no effort seemed be being made by the fire brigade, who, with their fire engine stood in amongst the crowd unable to move. I saw one woman being carried out from amongst the crowd bleeding from head to foot. She was put into an ambulance. Before the fire brigade got set to work five three to five story houses were well on their way to being burned out. In one sense it would not have mattered much if the whole street of houses had be burned out. It was a street of houses of ill-fame, a street, the occupants of which have been the ruin of thousands of our soldiers lives.
