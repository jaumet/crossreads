  
 friend was supposed to have rung up on Wednesday but failed to do so - Anyhow he may be coming to Cairo soon & then I shall see him again.  I have just written to Mrs McCallum & the Osburnes. 
 I have not been able to trace poor old Keith yet but I think he may be at Heliopolis, so I shall soon find him then.  Captain Main said he had a fractured leg & a few scratches caused by a bomb, but glad to say nothing to worry over.  He left Anzac on 7.10.15 & I only received the letter Friday, which was sent that day.  It is very hard indeed to trace the sick & wounded, so many different hospitals & no one knows where they are sent to. 
 I'm hoping there will be heaps of letters waiting for me at The Palace so shall not finish this until I have returned to the hospital.
