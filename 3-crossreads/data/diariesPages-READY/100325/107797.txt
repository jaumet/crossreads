At midday saw a large Arab funeral passing the Roman Catholic Cathedral An Arab band lead, marching at a most extraordinary dead slow pace and playing a haunting tune ? a crying dirge, ? on their instruments. Behind them followed children carrying large white wreaths and so on. The corpse on a hearse. Everyone in pure white ? evidently the mourning colour.
