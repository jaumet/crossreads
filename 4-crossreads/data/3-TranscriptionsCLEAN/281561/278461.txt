this ship made good practice with 6 rounds of 6 inch and 6 of Howitzer depth charges. I do some duty as guard, I reckon I won't be caught again. 9/4/18.Nothing doing. There is a vast amount of wetness in the world, but every turn of the propellers is driving us nearer to the dear old Southland. Splendid weather continues, and everyone is debating when we will get to Capetown. The anniversary of the attack on Hermies and the death of my good comrade Palmer.12/4/18.Table Mountain was visable at dawn; also a fine big sailing ship sweeping along under full sail a grand sight.Got into the Capetown docks at 10. A.M. General leave from 11. A.M. till 11. P.M. Went and inspected the city and did some business.
