  
 at 2pm, but did not sail till 5.15pm. Before we sailed the Ladies were handing baskets full of oranges and pineapples to the Boys. The Boys all enjoyed themselves at Durban and would have liked to have spent a few more days there. The first day out from Durban we had it very rough but as all the Boys had their "Sea Legs" by this time, it did no effect them in any way.
