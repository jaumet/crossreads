19 February 1918 Tuesday (X to X crossed out)BETHLEHEM!!!X Once more I'm here & more time to let the wonder of our Saviour's birth be reconciled with the present strife of living X-   We watered our horses at Solomons Pool (These pools are the water supply for Jerusalem) near village of Khudr, where Greeks had built a Church & in the distance could see the Minarets of Jerusalem.The Church is built among a village of mud Huts & filthy surroundings, but has a beautiful Dome etc & Clock tower which chimes the hours-   As we marched thro' Bethlehem some School children sang "Onward Christian Soldiers"I write from a peak 1723 ft high & the Dead Sea is 1300 ft below only a few miles away.
