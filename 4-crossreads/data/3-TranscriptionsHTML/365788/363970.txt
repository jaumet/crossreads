There are such pretty flowers growing in the fields here. &ndash; Cornflowers red Poppies, Daisies and a lot of yellow ones and some Heliotrope coloured ones of which I don't know the name.<br/>We don't often see donkeys over here but I have seen a few. &ndash; The other day there were fourteen observation balloons up in the air at the same time. &ndash; Officers go up in them and have telescopes to see what the Germans are <strike>are</strike> doing. I hope your dear mother is well again &amp; that you and Tingsie &amp; Peter are three dear little Comforts to her and Daddy. &ndash; With very much love to you all.<br/>Your loving Uncle,<br/>Fred.S.Phillips</p>
