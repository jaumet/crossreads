9.9.18Fine weather prevailed the weather being extreemly hot & muggy. Reports by wireless of submarines about but none sighted. At 10 pm we were 2 miles behind the convoy. The guide morsed & complained bitterly so put up extra speed & took up our proper position.
10.9.18Our speed reduced this day to 13 knots, zig zagging throughout. Signals from the guide complaining of our transport being not in stations the reason I shall not mention here & exposing ourselves in the event of a submarine attack.Two military captains volunteered to trim coal during the night in the bunkers. The went down & worked hard & I spoke to them next morning. They had a great experience but owing to the work being hard & unacustomed to it were completely knocked out & hands blistered.Concert held this night which proved a great success
