<p>LE HAVRE, Aug. 24, '18.<br/>Yesterday I was taken to see some of the great ordnance stores - such stores as you never saw in your life. Miles of eatables and wearables and destructive articles. Acres of them - forests of them - mountains of them - a small city of food, weapons, clothes and implements. Guns of all calibres were lying round like bundles of cigars. The docks, were full of dazzled ships and the unloading where it wasn't done by electric or hydraulic cranes was done by coons and chows*. The chows were a cheerful lot; full of jokes. As usual there are swarms of Yanks. Last night "Tom" took me into town to dinner and with us was a chap from Vic., a former schoolteacher who plays the piano well. At the very nice restaurant where we went and where they were well known, there was a piano in a room near the dining room and Rowe, the pianist, got busy while we awaited dinner. Pretty soon a very good-looking young American sergeant put his head in the; door and asked for a piece he liked and shortly after 4 officers, friends of his, came in. They were very jolly chaps and when we went into the dining room, they told us to be sure to come back. We promised, but twice before we'd finished one of them came in and reminded us of the agreement. We did so at last and had various songs. The chap next me turned out to come from 151st St. New York so I asked him if he knew of Coogan's bluff and St. Nicholas Ave. and told him how and why I did. He turned to the others and said "Say fellers. Why! Look at here!! This boy comes right from where I do."** We exhausted talk about that locality and we all talked a blue streak and had a most enjoyable time. They wanted us to meet them again, but I don't see it coming off, unfortunately. I don't feel much like going about and it's a long way from the depot into town and the trains and trams are unfamiliar to me. This morning I went on a parade, the object of which, for me, consisted in ascertaining when I enlisted; and for that I was kept waiting an hour. I can learn nothing of when the boat goes and am not likely to. One is kept entirely in the dark. When I get to England it won't be to London; but if I can't get up at once you can come down to me. Of course I will do my best to get there with all speed, see Col. Evans and through him try to get out via Americas so as to see the kiddies en route [Approval was  given to return to Australia at his own expense]. That may not be possible, but in any case it won't be long before we are together. The news is still very good<br/>**I lived in N.Y. City for a while.<br/>*Negroes &amp; Chinese</p>
