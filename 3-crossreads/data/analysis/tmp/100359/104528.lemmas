 was veri necessari as it was get rather warm , and the gallant 8th were lose more sweat than they had ever done befor . It was not bad walk general , but now and then we struck patch of loos sand , into which we sunk , over our boot top and was veri hard on the transport hors . Befor we start we were given strict order to be veri care with our water , the wisdom of which prove itself , befor we had gone mani mile . We halt at 11.30 for dinner , which consist of Bulli Beef and Biscuit a littl jam , and water , the water in our bottl was quit hot , but all the same it was worth it weight in gold . Dure our dinner spell , a few hundr Arab sprang up from somewher , and hung around wait for what was left of our "banquet " . The transport waggon had kept up with us , and it was veri nice to have even their shade as the sun was blaze hot by this time . We did not start off again till about 1 o'clock and this spell gave the straggler from the Infantri a chanc to catch up with their unit again . We had not gone far when the poor old Infantrymen began to drop out with sore feet , and general knock up , so our O.C. Col. Shepheard sent some of us out in Stretcher squad to assist them , as much as possibl . Lorri Trousdal was No. 4 in our squad , which consist of Stan Wright , Billi May and myself . We had the First Aid satchel with us , also a Field Servic Water bottl , and the chap who fell out were veri glad of a drink of water and a sprinkl of Boric Acid for their feet .
