<p>our spring. The foyer is large but the balcon open on the rue &amp; has little attraction except for smokers. Most of world promenades in foyer &amp; I limp there also. My leg is now very painful.</p>
<p>8-8-19<br/>Pay a visit to M. Petit Dupalle re my certificate but he is out &amp; I arrange to see him to morrow. (When however I am to ill to move)</p>
<p>I then visit garden &amp; Musee de Luxembourg with its wonderful statuary though one can find fault with much that is there In fact it turns out that [indecipherable] is not the [indecipherable] by which one is placed in Luxemburg but rather [indecipherable]</p>
<p>The paintings are removed in [first] place to an exhibition of Carolus Duran whose early painting, The Dame au gant (1848) are the best. The finest picture in collection is a painting of Duran himself by one of his pupils an <strike>Englishman</strike> American named John S Sargent. It is a masterpiece &amp; puts to shame the rest of the collection. I should very much like to see more of Sergents work.</p>
<p>After this we reached the Church of St Sulpice in front of which is the Square St Sulpice with it fountain supported by the 4 leading preachers of France &amp; alongside The Seminaire du St Sulpice where one of the acts of Manon has peace. The church is in Renaissance style &ndash; a roomy edifice once a Temple of Victory in times</p>
