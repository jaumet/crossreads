<p>I think I told you I have met Harry Cross across here he looks very well.  Tell Les I have met that friend of his J. Souter he is looking very well also wished to be remembered to Les.  I have met a fair number here lately I knew on the boat.  They have been split up a bit.  Some have been wounded &amp; sent to England another is in Sydney.  I had a great talk with them.  Met them all by accident.<br/>No more just now Father will have to close.  Will write each week if I can.  Don't worry am O.K. love to all.</p>
<p>Your sincere<br/>Son Clyde</p>
<p>N.B. 30.1.16<br/>The letter you wrote me to the Argyllshire the day we left turned up this morning.  It has been travelling a fair bit from the look of the envelope.  I am satisfied as long as you are alive the mail will eventually find you.  The letter is dated 30th Sept. 1915.</p>
