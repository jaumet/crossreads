<p>Wednesday 8th Dec. During the greater part of the day we were unloading the ship. Some of us were down in the bottom floor of the holds loading the slings. On leaving the ship we had some experience at loading railway trucks. The natives are better at talking than working. Its very amusing to see the native policeman using his stick freely amongst the arabs. Well, we were soon in rough third class wooden carriages which created a frightful noise when the train was in motion. The railway line runs right to the boat. No</p>
