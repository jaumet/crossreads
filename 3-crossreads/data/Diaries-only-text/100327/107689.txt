village being Christians are not veiled but their shirts are worn as pantaloons. Returned after dark looked right down on the camp ? a sea of tents. Our old muleteer doubled at times along the mule track stopping at each wayside spring for a drink. On reaching camp found all kit missing owing to shift taking place during our absence. Imbros generally appears to be a barren place not very wide. The view across to the Peninsular showed Achi Baba Suvla Bay c. Mess at 1700 reading Bed 2015

Slept in tent very cold with rain wind. Dysentery again. Up at 0700 and Kephalos looked dreary. After breakfast went over to Canteen and managed after much trouble to buy 61 cases of tinned and other provisions. These I had stacked beyond canteen boundary and the men built a dugout with waterproof sheets on roof using the cases for walls. Sentry mounted, Also bought 240 oranges for 10/-. In the morning bitter cold and raw Went to Ordnance and bought a pair of slacks and a mackintosh cape for 1. First had to get chit from officer 2nd Find corporal and indicate goods required he made out requisitions in triplicate and still retained goods. 3rd Went back to officer and he signed requisitions, 4th Took reqs down road and round corner to Field Cashier and paid him the money he signed. 5th Took reqs back to Ordnance Corpl he gave me one back and the goods, so completing the operation. A triumph of red tape
