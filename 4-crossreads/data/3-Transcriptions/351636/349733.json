<p>Dear Mr. Horsfield &ndash;<br/>The bearer Mrs. Andrews says she wants to go back to Queensland where she has been promised work. She belongs to Queensland I understand and you have been helping her since she came here. I am not sure if you will help under the circumstances as she should really not be under our Funds. She came down when her husband went into camp.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br/>B Booth &ndash;</p>
