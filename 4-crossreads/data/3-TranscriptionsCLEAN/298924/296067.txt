  
 Wednesday 26 March 1919 Colombo One of the best Hotels in the world I think.  We took Rickshaw & did some shopping in Colombo, both Dolly & the Babe looked wonderfully well.  I put them on board the Derbyshire at 5 p.m. & returned to Ulimaroa.  The former boat left the harbour, some 4 hours ahead of our board & as our Firemen are drunk not much chance of keeping up.  I am glad to say Capt. McLean is on the Derbyshire & is very good to the little wife. Bought 50/-/- Bananas, Pineapples & Oranges for the men & 15000 cheer.
