<p>was a great scramble &amp; the row of shouting natives &amp; hee-hawing donkies was tremendous.  It was all very funny.  The 7th Lancaster Territorial Regt are quartered here.  They are very small chaps but good drillers and marchers.  The tucker here is better than in camp &amp; this job would do me all the time we are here.  The niggers do all the work clean camp, dishes, boots, bandoliers, etc.  Went on duty at 8pm with 12 others regulating the traffic &amp; seeing that soldiers did not overcrowd trains, etc.  3 of us went down to Manchiet-el-Sadr where we set on a seat &amp; had nothing to do.  Knocked off at 11.30 &amp; got back to barracks.  Received letter from Frank &amp; letter from mother posted at Suez.</p>
