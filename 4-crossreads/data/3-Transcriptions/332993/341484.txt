<p>There is again heavy artillery actions this evening &amp;amp to night.<br/>I have seen a number of German Post cards taken off prisoners. They are cards soldiers in the trenches received from Germany also German money and Helmets. Their helmets are heavy and far inferior to the English or French. The French look the best but the English are the best life preserver.</p>
<p>(1046) Thursday June 14. 1917.<br/>A fine day but warmer. There is a cool breeze blowing.<br/>This morning there is nothing special to chronicle.<br/>The British declaration to Russia shows identity of war aims of the allied nations, &amp;amp express willingness to examine all agreements made from time to time &amp;amp if need be revise them. Britain's position at the outset was to defend the existence of their country &amp;amp to enforce respect for international engagements. To these objects has now been added that of liberating populations oppressed by <strike>the</strike> alien tyranny.<br/>There are some strange contrasts in this war, a mixture of everyday life and tragedy. A field that was terribly shelled on Monday is now being cultivated by an industrious Frenchman.<br/>There is a very narrow margin between civilian life &amp;amp the battle front. The soldiers camps are dotted about the fields, around the villages, in the towns. In fact they live with the people whose homes we have come to protect. The civilian has come to regard the screech of shells, &amp;amp the bursting of schrapnel as a matter</p>
