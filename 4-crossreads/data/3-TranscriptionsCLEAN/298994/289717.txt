  
 I received 50 letters on our long march. The march seemed much lighter! The weather was very chilly at this period We had a church parade in front of a fine chateau the next day. We are having a fine time in a way at Mezieles, if it only lasts. 
 On the 28th Nov 1917 I visited Eu, about 6 miles distant from Mezieles. Eu was a fine type of town, its cathedral was particularly fine 
 I went to Trieport,(in pencil-Trieport a resort)  on the coast per electric tram later and was more interested in this place. The canals running into the streets was economical to my way of thinking. I wandered round the cliffs and on the beach, had a ride on a queer type of railway running to the top of the cliffs from the base, a distance of about 75 yards. I had a rattling dinner at Trieport! I spent a fine day here! 
 We had a route march next day Nov 29th 1917, it did not seem so
