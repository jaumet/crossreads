<p>she has lost six sons in the present war and the remaining boy is fighting on the Somme.<br/>The only inhabitants left in any of these towns near the firing line run shops of some sort. Numbers run eating houses where the hungry soldier can satisfy his hunger on fried eggs and chips and coffee. It is invariably the same in them all. One can never get anything but fried eggs and chips and coffee the latter served in small bowl holding as much as a small afternoon-tea cup. They never think of offering poached or boiled eggs for a change and meat is out of the question. Others run the eternal "estaminet" and as always do a roaring trade although their hours for business are exceedingly short; 12 noon till 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. till 8 p.m.<br/>Still more make money out of the troops by selling electric torches and trinkets and souvenirs of France. In fact nearly all the windows are crambed full of such trinkets and also cheap french watches. Beautiful faces with radium tipped hands and figures but scarcely any work. My word they are daylight robbers too and they recognise the Australians as good marks and fleece them right and left. The only way to secure anything at a reasonable price is to get a frenchman to purchase for you.<br/>I must hastily conclude now in order to catch the mail.<br/>Best of love<br/>Eugene.</p>
