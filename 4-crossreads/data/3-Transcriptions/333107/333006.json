<p>Sun. Feb. 17. <br/>Beards and I are on all day. Our "P.M." day we call it. Lovely day too. Just the sort of day to go for a Picnic with B.E. Got a Letter from Jacko. He informs me that Billy May got the Belgian Croix de Guerre. Good Luck to him.</p>
<p>Commenced Letter No 8 to B.E. Funny thing, I was looking thro' my diary this morning and find that I wrote last years No 8 on this date.</p>
<p>A good number of the officers are away, so things are fairly quiet.</p>
<p>Mon. 18<br/>Another Glorious day. The Gothar attempted to raid London yesterday but only one of 'em got thro' the barrage.</p>
<p>Wasted the afternoon in going for classification and found it's not on till tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tues. 19<br/>Went before old Von Hagan for classification and was told to carry on. Glorious weather, Carr came back from Leave.</p>
<p>Wed. 20</p>
<p>Bill Beard went to Tidworth to apply for a job on the Motor Transport. It was a 60 mile ride on a Bike and he was knocked up when he returned.</p>
<p>The new Housekeeper arrived last night. She is a much younger person that the last one. Bert, the Chef, returned from Leave.</p>
<p>I really ought to write some Letters, but there is nothing to write about.</p>
