<p>May 19 night just off Southampton. Cigs dished out after tea,</p>
<p>20 Glorious morning. One or two tramps passing along the fairway. On our Right is dear old England &amp; on the left the beautiful Isle of Wight its foreshores literally covered with trees out of which peep a few fine old buildings or mayhap even an ancient Castle.</p>
<p>Left the boat about 9.30 waited on the platform for over half an hour &amp; then entrained. We are now waiting just outside Southampton &ndash; what for I don't know. &ndash; Just finished a bowl of tea some bread &amp; jam &amp; a cig! There are several women carriage cleaners outside yarning to the boys, mostly middle aged &amp; grey haired women.<br/>(3rd London Genl Hosp Wandsworth SW) Arrived here per motor from Waterloo Station about 3.40 had Cocoa, a hot bath, &amp; then tea. Am in Ward D3, &amp; there are some of our boys here.<br/>[in margin] London</p>
