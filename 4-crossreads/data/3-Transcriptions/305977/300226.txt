<p>Mail day.  Got letters from Frank &amp; mother.</p>
<p>Saturday 12th<br/>My birthday.  Was feeling right again this morning.  Went down to the beach &amp; had a swim.  The water was pretty cold.  Chauncey got sick &amp; it is feared he has typhoid.  He went away probably to Lemnos.  The Turks put in a good deal of shrapnel in the morning but knocked off about 10am, our batteries must have been making it to warm for them.  Had yarn with Capt Robertson this morning &amp; scored a few envelopes off him.</p>
<p>Sunday 13th<br/>Fine warm day, very quiet.  Howlett got sick &amp; went for a few days spell.  Relieved C Company.  Went into the trenches at noon &amp; came out 6am.  Received letter from Carrie.</p>
<p>Monday 14th<br/>Had a good spell during the day.  The Turks put in some big shells today, but they didn't do much damage.  Was on fatigue at night digging.<br/>Tuesday 15th<br/>Went into the trenches at 6am.</p>
