<p>we are camped together.</p>
<p>We had snow here last week, &amp; up on the hills it was as much as two feet deep. I have never seen anything prettier than snow in a thick wood, when all the branches are bowed down with the weight of it. I can quite see now, that these are some compensations for living in a blighted land.</p>
<p>I think I told you in a previous letter that I called on the Sly's &amp; Miss Sly took me round to Mrs Edwards. Since then, Mrs Edwards has asked me round to see her. She was a great friend of Evan Richards, &amp; thought the world of him.</p>
<p>This letter ought just to reach you in time to miss New Year, but for all that I will wish you a tardy bright &amp; happy one, &amp; a merry Christmas.</p>
<p>I am writing to father &amp; Dorothy so will give all the love in this letter to you.</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
<p>Keith</p>
