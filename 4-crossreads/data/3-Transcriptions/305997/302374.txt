<p><u>Gallipoli</u><br/>20:10:15 &ndash; favours an adverse wind, so alternated is it with gullies, narrow-gutted defiles and passes.  There is little protection from the elements anywhere.  Bleak and bitter are the climatic conditions.  Rain continues to threaten, and the 'Office' is deluged with huge dust clouds that render work nigh impossible.  All have commenced to wear their great coats and continued physical exercise of some description or other is required to keep one's self warm:  altogether I feel splendid and the change from exasperating heat to bitter cold seems to have favoured my physique &ndash; I am keener, I have lost the morbid feeling which permeated me during the stifling hot days, and I eat and sleep better.</p>
<p>21:10:15 &ndash; Nothing unusual and the weather is unchanged.  Very quiet day.  Major Pinwell fills in his spare time by raiding the remnants of the flies, which seek the shelter of his Office, with a fly whisk.</p>
<p>23:10:15 &ndash; Bleak, raw day &ndash; tempestuous sea running.  General Godley leaves for Mudros to meet Lieutenant-Colonel Rhodes.</p>
<p>24:10:15 &ndash; Weather unchanged &ndash; shelled with shrapnel during afternoon.</p>
<p>25:10:15 &ndash; Changes in the weather are meteoric in their suddenness.  I awoke at 5.30 a.m., and it was a beautiful morning like in early spring.  The weather has changed in a night:  the threatening clouds, bleak wind and raw atmosphere of yesterday have been replaced by a bright blue sky and the warm sun's rays.  Everyone seems happier, small birds sing cheerfully and flutter about the bushes with awakened activity &ndash; the troops welcome the change with whistle and song and seem rejuvenated in their appreciation of the perfect morn.  I walked with Cocks before breakfast to the 54th Divisional lines, had a warm sponge bath (out of a kerosene tin) on return, and had a hearty breakfast of biscuit porridge.</p>
<p><u>Vide Peninsula Press:</u> - The British Press have denied the report of the "Daily Telegraph" that the Government is expected to cede Cyprus to Greece in the event of Greece joining the Allies.  An Allied Squadron bombarded the Bulgarian coast in the afternoon of the 21st October for a distance of 38 miles.  A number of military look-out stations along the coast were destroyed and gun emplacements shelled.  Harbour works at Dedeagatch were bombarded.  Incidentally, shipping warehouses, piers, etc., the railway bridge on the east end of the town and much rolling stock were destroyed.  Several large fires were started, one evidently an old torpedo depot.  The residential part of the town was not attacked.  The enemy did not reply.  The landing of French troops at Salonika is continuing regularly under the best conditions.  The French troops who have crossed the Greek frontier have got into touch with the Servian troops.</p>
