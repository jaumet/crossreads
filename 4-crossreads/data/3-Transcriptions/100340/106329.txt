<p>France<br/>15/2/18</p>
<p>My Dear Sis  &amp; Vol,<br/>I received your letter dated Oct 9th  &amp; also your Xmas card. Altogether I received 28 so you can bet I have been pretty busy writing; it was the first mail I had received for over ten weeks. Laurel was an easy first with six letters  &amp; a card with Auntie second with four. Am very sorry I have disappointed you about not going back to France but I have already written  &amp; told you how it was I came back again. I have not been passed</p>
