Amiens to Rouen 
6/2/17 up a conversation as it served to cover Monsieur le docteur as well. We carried on a talk in broken French (none of them spoke English) and soon became fast friends. They consider that at present rate of progress the Bosche will never be shifted out of France but that economic victory will result soon, and also that we treat prisoners too well. On a discussion re sanitation the doctor said that he knew the French method of a courtyard with close buildings, dung heap bad latrines and wells taking all fresh soakage was wrong in theory but says it does not affect health all the same in his opinion. This morning at Gare St Roch for 50 feet up from the main entrance the footpath was in a disgusting malodorous state owing the men easing themselves thereabouts. The smell of urinal at Cafe Godbert would sink a ship. It was impossible to see any scenery during the first part of the journey although the train crawled at snails pace. The windows were thick with frost and ice. Heavy snow covers all the fields. The train is the slowest imaginable and we are now at Longereux-Vieux-Manoir and have been here for over an hour and a half indeed over 2 hours merely standing idle on the track
