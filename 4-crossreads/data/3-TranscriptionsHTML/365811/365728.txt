<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I was talking of you last night to Pitt, he has not long returned from the U.K. &amp; as I have a few minutes to spare think Ill send you a few lines.</p>
<p>I hear Keith is back in Australia, I hope he is getting on well, I was so sorry I missed him when in London. I trust Mrs. Ferguson &amp; Dorothy are well, I hope the latter will forgive my speaking of her so familiarly, she must be quite grown up by now.</p>
<p>I receive Sydney papers regularly &amp; am kept fairly well up in legal talk, there does not seem to be much new about it, I fear I have forgotten much that I knew in 1915 &amp; I feel as if I would have to start reading on my return.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that Major Simpson has relinquished command of the battalion, he was much</p>
