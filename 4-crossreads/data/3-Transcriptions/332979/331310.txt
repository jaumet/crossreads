<p>about &frac34; of Mile on further we came to the Village of Headley which was very pretty &amp; picturesque the Church of England building is covered all over the sides &amp; Front &amp; back with Ivy also the Tombstones were very old some dating back to 1783 &amp; perhaps earlier as several Tombstones were covered over with Moss. The Ivy Creeper I noticed was growing up amongst the Trees &amp; along the Roadway. After inspecting the inside of the Church we started on our return journey which was done in quick time. After Tea we had to parade at 7 Pm to receive our pay &amp; later on at 10 Pm for our Railway tickets. As we were leaving early next morning for London we were all busy cleaning our Boots &amp; Leggings. We all settled down at 11 Pm &amp; soon was fast asleep.</p>
