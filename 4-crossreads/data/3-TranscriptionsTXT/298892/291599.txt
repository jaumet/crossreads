 The stretcher bearers bring the wounded from the firing line to the R.A.P. and it is our Detail which attends to them there. We were treated to a fine display of flying at the Divisional Sports last week. We were all engrossed in the ring events when an aeroplane came swooping down close over our heads, it was a windy day and at each turn the plane took the wires twanged like a harp and could be heard all over the oval. After circling round the ring two or three times at no greater height then 15 feet,  so that we all thought they would crash amongst us at any moment, the intrepid airman rose to a considerable height and dashed straight down at the shed near the oval and just as we expected to see his machine smashed to match wood he shot up into the air clearing the shed by a few feet; when the machine was some thousands of feet up it then looped the loop four successive times; then coming quite low again the airman waved us a farewell and soon shot out of sight. There were two men in the machine but of course one of them does all the work. I believe he is a V.C.; as he came back and landed near the sports ground later and chatted to our Officers, and I heard his name but have now forgotten it. He wasn't Robinson of Zepp fame anyway
