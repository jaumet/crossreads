midnight, I found the whole place taken up with Tommies going back to France from their leave dozens of girls were there seeing them off singing dancing all the time, they were kicking up a great row, while waiting here great trainloads of Yanks kept on coming through they were just off the ships I was the first Australian they had ever seen so they were greatly interested in me my uniform they have been hearing a good bit about the Aussies since the Yanks made that attack with our chaps they think the Australians are the fighters they fairly crowded round me as if I was a piece of curiosity the questions they asked it was very amusing to me, but they are a fine lot of chaps no mistake
