  
 Sunday 2 September 1917. 
 Turned out at 5 am & straight into sea for a dip. We are leaving here this morning. 
 At 11.15 am. had everything packed up, and ourselves & camels in full marching order. left Malaleh Beach at 11.30 a.m. & treked to Rafa. Got few stores. Then through to Shiekh Nuran arriving there at 5.30 pm. (Times 11.15 a.m.  to  2 pm. 5.20 p.m.)  Sudanese  Egyptians unsaddled camels & we after a light tea turned in as best we could as "boarders" in some of the dugouts for the night. 
 Most impt thing - got 12 letters that were waiting here a week for me. "Good, oh"!
