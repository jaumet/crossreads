<p>I speculated 30 piastres today on purchasing <strike>an</strike> a quilt made of pure wool quite a comfortable affair Am giving it a trial tonight for the first time. We are now connected up with all our outposts by telephone they save a good deal of trouble. I have been neglecting to write to anyone lately the principal reason being that I am far too busy with my work. and another reason is that I am putting in a good deal of spare time writing up this diary and making it as interesting as I possibly can which is very hard work. and I am not gifted in that art. During some of my travels on Foreign Service either in India or South Africa I have kept a diary and I always found it hard work to keep it up day by day especially when we were kept busy as generally happens when a Cavalry Regiment get out on Camp or Manoeuvres.</p>
