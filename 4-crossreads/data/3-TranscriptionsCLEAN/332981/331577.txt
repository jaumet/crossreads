  
 Pilot came aboard, we left at 11 am and after a pleasant journey in beautiful weather, passing several large mines & large towns we arrived at Ronet for water, away again to Namur running along side & crossing the River Sambre were a large number of barges were moving about, we arrived at Namur, a very large railway centre & which appeared to be very busy. 
 Between Montignee & Namur the railway crosses the River Sambre 15 times, it winds about so much. On the journey I noticed a large number of German engines worked by German vrews & each engine had a signboard with writing on it. Not to be detained return to Allemagne, Railway Material. There were German engines, carriages & trucks everywhere, the German engine drivers had a white square sign on their arms. They are being used for bringing the rolling stock from Germany to the Allies which has to be handed over. 
 I arrived at Namur at 4 pm, this is a fine city & trams
