<p>Tuesday 21 January 1919<br/>Rafa<br/>Post today &amp; enclose snap shots of Babe, hope to go on leave in a weeks time.  I get very homesick at times, it seems such a waste of time out here, when a man's youth is gone.<br/>Love to you all.<br/>Bronchitis better but still not too fit, hope no permanent effects from Influenza you all had.<br/>Joe will be settled down again &amp; thankful to be in his own bed I expect.</p>
