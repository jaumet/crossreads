<p>the incidence of the fighting on our men.  It is said that hundreds have been killed &amp; large numbers wounded.  Sad if true.  As there be two days before Saturday morning, I maybe in a position to write more about them tomorrow.

My shoes were left, the guides removed their over clothes.  In the same order we clambered over the projecting stones.
