Mooch round all day, nothing doing. Get Major Conrick to recommend me for leave to Corbie on morrow. Had letter from Mr. Beattie. He tells me Arnold was buried at Davoux a village out of Corbie. Will try find it for them leave some memento there on their behalf. 
Go into Albert for paper taking Reg with me en route.
