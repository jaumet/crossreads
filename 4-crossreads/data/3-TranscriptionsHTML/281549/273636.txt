<p>The British Relief Commite supply us with some biscuits every now &amp; again &amp; these relieve the pangs of hunger for a little while.</p>

<p>The 11th of May I was vaccinated against Smallpox but I rubbed it off to prevent it from taking effect. During last week there was two more fresh batches of Australian Prisoners arrive. The weather is getting much warmer and is twilight till 10 o'clock at night.</p>
