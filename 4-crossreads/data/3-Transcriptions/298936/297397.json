<p>August 1915</p>
<p>Saturday 28</p>
<p>Very busy day today as usual.</p>
<p>Finished stocktaking above &amp; below &amp; have handed completed lists  to Lt. Col. [indecipherable] who was pleased with them.</p>
<p>No rest for 16 hours.</p>
<p>Had a few minutes off in the evening &amp; attend the final of the box up.</p>
<p>News received of victory in the Baltic Sea; 6 German cruisers sunk by Russians &amp; one dreadnought by British submarine.</p>
<p>It is wonderful &amp; what a difference this news has made in me for I have lost the tired &amp; weary feeling completely</p>
