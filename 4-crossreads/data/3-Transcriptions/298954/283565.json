<p>Thu. 7th Feb.<br/>In lieu of the bath-towels and very short "shorts" which were the vogue when I was here last, they are now wrapped in old sweaters etc capped by rainbow-hued Alpine caps made of all sorts of old material.   White blankets have been much used for these, the scarlet edging being used for tassels. &ndash; Bob made two high Cossack snow-caps from an old saxe-blue and white bath-mat from the "Hitachi"!    I was the proud possessor of one of these, also of a scarlet and white cap given me by Fat Hans.   The new hospital has been made very comfortable by Webbie (who is in charge)</p>
<p>There are about 11 bunks and about the same number of cane lounges.   The place is carpeted &ndash; possesses a looted piano &ndash; a couple of basket chairs, and is quite warm although the temperature outside is below 19&deg; F.</p>
