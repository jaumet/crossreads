  
 Dorothy & I had a lovely time to-day - spent the afternoon at the  Zoo  - It is a beautiful place & it is so nice & fresh out there - we got dressed as soon as we were off duty & had some nourishment in our room, so that we had a much longer time out there - had a huge afternoon tea there & enjoyed ourselves very much - Got back to hospital in time for 7 p.m. Dinner - Dorothy is sound asleep in bed but I'm writing this first because I can sleep in to-morrow. Have not yet decided what to do yet to-morrow.  Am resting in the morning.  Shall keep this open & write more if the mail does not close in the morning. 
 16.12.15. No news of the mail closing but shall finish this to-night.  Yesterday I had a lovely day.
