Dear Mr Waterhouse
By chance I happened to see in a newspaper that you are severing your connection with the "Old School" .  The paper was dated 24th June, this is the middle of August  it will be well into September before this reaches Australia;  but,  although rather late, I would like, as an old boy, to join with the school  in expressing their thanks for all that you have done for us.  Personally I have to thank you and the school for my career.
All of the old boys that are here at the Dardanelles I know will learn with regret of your retirement. There must be a number here but so far I only have met two. One is Biden who has been doing great work with the Engineers; at present he is away sick but I hope will be back soon. The other is Haig from Albury also with the engineers.
Our boys have done wonderfully well here and the 1st Force have made a name which will be hard to live up to. They compare more that favourably with the men of K's army who have a great admiration for our boys. A major of the Leinster Regiment in company with the two said: -
"I class your men as racehorses ours as Clydesdales" . We have lost & lost heavily at times and it is hard to see good men go down, but they are splendid & we who are still spared can only try &  live up to the standard they have set us.
With my kindest regardsI amYours very sincerelyR  Broadbent
