Shelter Wood 
27/2/17 Must be suffering from a form of shell shock as the brain seems numb. A day after I cannot remember the events of yesterday. I send for an officer to tell him something and when he arrives stand speechless not knowing what to tell him and only long for a little rest away from things military in a peaceful region.
28/2/17 Much better. In camp all day and attended a lecture by Forbes on the need of better communication. Otherwise quiet in camp.
