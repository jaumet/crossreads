<p>the inevitable result of exposure. Several hours later I was taken into a small room in the adjacent building where the first dressing was applied. During the operation an orderly attempted to steal my wallet; much to my amazement the Doctor prevented him by shouting something unintelligible to me. I appreciated his humane action. The Doctor then proceeded with his work, placed a rough dry dressing over my knee, and a piece or board under my leg to prevent any movement of the knee.
