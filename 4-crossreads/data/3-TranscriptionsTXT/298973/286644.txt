Almost female screams. Another rather poor turn was first counted out, and then a wit from somewhere up aloft let a very large ripe pumpkin slowly down almost in his arms. It simply brought the house down, and it had its effect. One of the Tasmanian Infantry dressed in ladies' evening dress simply looked a big dear. How on earth he rigged himself up I don't know.
