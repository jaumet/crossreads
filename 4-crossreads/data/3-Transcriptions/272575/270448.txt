<p>Time for sight seeing.   There is a nice Town not very far away and I must have a try to see some of it.   it will be the first time I have had an opportunity to see a decent french town and if I am granted leave it will be the first in france for I have never had a pass on this side of the water as I have never been near a place that was really worth seeing except when we were Travelling.   Now there is little more to tell you just yet.   So I will ring down the curtain.  Heaps of love to all especially yourself and Mother from your Loving Bro.  Chas. G.</p>
<p>Did I tell Mother in my last letter that I had a letter from Bea. my letter reached her Safely at Omdurman.<br/>C.</p>
