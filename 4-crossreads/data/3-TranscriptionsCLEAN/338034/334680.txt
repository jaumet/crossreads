  
 We are now doing patrol duties & are getting into close touch with the enemy. Taubes were overhead today & bombed Bir-el-abd, one plane was very nearly brought down by our anti-aircraft guns. The railway line crossing the Desert has been hurried along lately & is now about 15 miles East of Bir-el-abd,  duplication work is proceeding apace  and water from the Nile is being brought out   in  through two large pipes, one about 8 inches in diameter & the other about 12 inches.
