  
 with water bottles full I met several of my N.Z. mates from Gisborne & I had the best tea I ever had, then I had a rest, then I went back to where our unit was supposed to be & found only a few had arrived several men were taken straight to the hospital others were supposed to have died and others went mad with thirst. It could never be found out if any men did die I dont believe any did but several were not any use to the army afterwards. Some of the transport did not get in till next day, we bivouaced that night & next day the Prince of Wales & Gen Birdwood came over to see us on horse
