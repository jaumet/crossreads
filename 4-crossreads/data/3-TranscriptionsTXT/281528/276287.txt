 5/4/18 &ndash; Bertangles the Band played.  Crowded with troops, part of Corps H.Q. and D.H.Q. are here.  Found my billet a nice clean room and talked to Madame who was an old woman, only son killed, and very despondent about the War.  The estaminets were open between 12-2 and some men speedily got drunk &amp; riotous on the wretched local wine.  Beer is unobtainable.  Had to put a strong picquet on to quell brawls &ndash; disgraceful.  The men are excited at the prospect of hopping over and there is a tense feeling.  The wine affects them very much.  Saw A.P.M. &amp; hope avoid recurrence tonight.
