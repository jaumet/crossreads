Heard a good yarn this morning:- A general was coming along the road when the "Gas Alert" was given and he hadn't a Helmet. Now it is a serious crime not to always have our Gas Helmets with us, one in a special pocket in our tunic and the other in a satchel slung over our shoulders. Of course the Gen. had a staff officer with him. They came across a Sentry "Ha, Sentry" said the Officer "How many helmets have you" "Two sir" said the Sentry, "You might give me one then" said the officer and taking it, he handed it to the General. They went on a bit further and came to where a Sergeant had a party of men on parade. The "eagle eye" of the Gen. soon spotted that the Serg. hadn't a Gas Helmet, "Ha Sergeant you on parade without a Gas Helmet, just take mine and show your men how to put it on, and report to me afterwards" The sergeant took the satchel, and diving in his hand to get the Helmet, produced ----- a dirty towel and a pair of socks.) This is a fine big brewery where we are billeted. We can walk in and get a glass of beer, just when we fancy. Yesterday Mac, Stan Wright, Tom Davis and I went out to tea. Had a good feed of Eggs and Chips, and Brian Aspinall shouted us a bottle of champagne, which greatly improved things. It is a pathetic sight to see the tiny tots going to school with gas helmets slung over their shoulders.
Monday 23rd 
Another quiet day. On parade this morning the S.O. read out some very eulogistic messages from the G.O.C. and A.D.M.S. about the way we worked at Fromelles. The Battns. are recovering very quickly although some of them lost very heavily. Our officers are kept going, censoring the hundreds of letters that are being written.

Good account in to days papers about our little scrap. A few were wounded arrived from the trenchs, suffering from high explosive shell wounds.
