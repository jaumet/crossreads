  
 never seen snow before & don't know any better It is very seldom you see English troops snowballing  I suppose they see enough of it, but the Australians are fair terrors for it. Another one of the Dukes fine parcels arrived today  all eatables & a sway of them too, he's a proper sort of friend to have. 18th. I am off parade again today   no boots on hand yet. I am not sorry in one way for it is snowing heavily & they are all out drilling Very funny in the Mess last night, there was plenty of whisky flying about, & it soon turned some of them up. Jock Mackie & I won 8 games of Bridge in succession last night, some going that.
