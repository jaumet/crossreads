<p>29/8/15  Q. What is the significance of the shaved or close clipped patch on top of the head of most of the natives and small tattoo symbols on both temples. Just </strike>side</strike> on both sides of mouth near lips also tattoo marks mostly in women which gives a drooping sort of look to face. Hands also often tattooed. Niggers very funny settling up &ndash; all bringing in faked a/cs &amp; when bowled out take it quite as a matter of course. Mohommed and washing man rebuffed severely. We have a tremendous day ahead of us yet God knows when we sleep, as we are travelling all night. Big Australian mail just arrived. The men will relish their letters before they go. Jack up to say goodbye &amp; swopped letters. Camp pretty clear. Surprised by the number of men who rush any job connected with horses. Only ask for a groom or mounted officers batman and fellows positively plead to be taken on saying they love horses &amp; so on</p>
