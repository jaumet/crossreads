<p>Wednesday, 14 April, 1915<br/>I am beginning to get tired of this and anxious to get out again it is a peculiar trait that no how much an Australian soldier is satisfied he is always growling for something better.  Had one of my front teeth filled to-day by resident dentist.</p>
<p>We all have to wear a badge on our arms now with L. D on light duty.  This allows us to smoke and to wander about the grounds.  A party went down from mena to Luna Park to convert it into a hospital for expected wounded.  Satisfactory news comes from the Dardanelles and papers report Austria is suing for peace.</p>
<p>Thursday, 15 April, 1915<br/>Time beginning to drag, we are all on light duty in our ward now.  Reports are going about that their has been a big action in the Dardanelles in which the 3rd Brigade Aust. Inf. Fared very badly so far it is not confirmed.</p>
<p>Our surgical ward has done fine work here, some great operations have taken place.</p>
<p>The base desert hospital is now at Abbassia where the reinforcements are.  This week I have written letters to all my friends in Aust.</p>
