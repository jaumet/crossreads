[heard] the great news that Roumania had declared war on the Central Powers, Oh that it is true.
Tuesday 30th
We definitely believe we are going to lose our horses and be replaced by camels now if so we must get some fighting.
Rode out to the sands and with the Colonel and Doctor to inoculate B Squadron, did so, coming home Col complemented me on recent work and discussed my com. One my mates the F.Q.M.S. has never reverted to the ranks rather than submit so the puppy of a VA we have.
Wednesday 31st
Definitely announced in papers that Roumania is in with us, I see visions of Australia after all. Rode out with the Doc to Land's End to finish inoculations that the Germans put Cholera virus in the water at Bir el Abd.
Thursday 31st AugOur Machine gun section arrived back to-day from Romani loaded down with war trophies etc. they have exciting tales to tell of the scrap but it all centres around one man Col Royston. The new R.S.M. is a hated beast and carries his life in his hands, he broke A Squadron and is trying the same on H. Qrs Sgts. He has me in such a state that I'll knock him regardless of rank.
Friday 1st SeptR.S.M. under close arrest, he is most contemptible beast I have yet to met in the whole service. We play poker every night, I hardly run on luck, for a time the reverse passed in with a vengeance.
