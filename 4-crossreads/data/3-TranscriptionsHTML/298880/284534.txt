<p>bombs, minnewerfers and pine apples mostly and just a couple&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of guns.</p>
<p>Sept 17th Monday.</p>
<p>The night before last about 60 men from the 56th Bn raided the hun's trenches after a short but furious bombardment from our mortars and guns. When they reached the trenches they found them empty with the exception of a few curios they brought nothing back. The other Bde raiders were more fortunate and were able to bring back some prisoners. The Scotties also had a successful raid. We worry the hun all the time and get no retaliation except a few minnewerfers and pineapple bombs. Our telephone lines are in good order just now but a Ninny made a mess of them last night.</p>
