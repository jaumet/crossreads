<p>MENIN GATE<br/>Friday 28<br/>Just preparing for a good night when along comes the order to move going up the line, We rested for the night at "La. Chytes"<br/>Saturday 29<br/>"Batt", reserve battalion doing fatigue work now camped alongside the moat of "Ypres" the old town is leveled almost to ground<br/>Sunday 30<br/>An awful night, heavy fighting, the artillerys roar was terrific and the explosion of aeriel torpedo's deadly, many horses killed<br/>A lovely day perfect by the will of God but by the will of man it is hellish and heartbreaking</p>
