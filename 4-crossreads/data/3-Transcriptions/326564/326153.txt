<p>not the slightest chance of winning . I'll bet they will get cut to pieces. The first news came through yesterday &amp; from that it appears they had broken through at Bullecourt &amp; Lagnicourt &amp; 1 or 2 more places but that signifies nothing for there is never any trouble for either side to make the first advance for they have all their guns registered on the trenches &amp; the front line is always lightly held, wait till they get up against the line of resistance &amp; have to haul their guns over shell torn ground  &amp; get them into position for the next push then the fun starts, we know all about that from personal experience &amp; as for man to man goes every Australian knows who is the superior  fighter, that has been tested too often &amp; the Fritzies know it in their own hearts too well</p>
