<p>At Sea<br/>26.12.1914<br/>Dear Mother,<br/>Just a line to let you know we have had a very fine trip so far.  We are just shaking down into our places now &amp;amp: are better off in some ways than in camp.  [indecipherable] have called no where to date so I have not yet received any letters.  Tell May I was sorry to have missed her but of course it could not be helped.<br/>Much love to all   &amp; best wishes for New Year from Your Affectionate son Charlie</p>
