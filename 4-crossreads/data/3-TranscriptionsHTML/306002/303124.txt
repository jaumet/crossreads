<p>28.4.15<br/>Wed. 28th.  Ordinary parade to-day &amp; it was quite a treat to be on Idleboy again, he was quite frisky after his spell.  We had dinner in the clump of palms near the pumping station, &amp; one of the lads raced one of the natives at dinner time as there are great arguments as to who is the fastest, the natives or the troopers.  The trooper won easily.  We arrived back in Camp at 3 oclock, after having a very easy time of it.  To-day was rather warm.  After tea I went over to see Arthur but found he had gone to town, had a game of billiards &amp; put the rest of the evening in writing.</p>
