<p>Officers, the weather was very cold &amp; Drizzly Rain was falling in fact we must be well down South as we have had very little Sun this week we will be all glad when we change our course &amp; get a little more Sun. When it is cold &amp; wet it is very miserable up on deck owing to the large number of Troops on board there being no place to sit &amp; be comfortable. Dinner time came around &amp; we had Barley Broth Roast Mutton Beans &amp; Potatoes. After a Smoke I had a Delightful Hot Salt Water Bath, having bought a Cake of Salt Water Soap which will lather in the Salt Water I hope to visit that Bathroom very often although one has to wait his turn as there is only one Bath provided, of course there</p>
