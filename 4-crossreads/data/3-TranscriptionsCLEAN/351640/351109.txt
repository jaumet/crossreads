While listening to the bugle's notes, my mind is with the people of this country, back thousands and thousands of years ago, as my eyes pick up the words which tell to me the history of Pharoe's dream, of the anterior dreams of his head butler & head baker, and of the manner in which Joseph, the prisoner, made interpretation of them. - 41-35 - "And let them gather up all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharoe, and let them keep food in the cities".Here am I in this same land of Egypt wherein Joseph - 41-46. "And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharoe King of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharoe, and went throughout all the land of Egypt".When Col. Springthorpe returned a few days ago from a journey to Luxor, anciently Thebes, he mentioned that he had been shown places which are supposed to be some of the granaries wherein Joseph caused to be stored the grain which was to be a source of food for the people when the East wind had brought a famine upon the land. 41-57. "And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn, for that the famine was so sore in all the lands". The narative has lasted adown the ages. Is it possible that any persons come here and depart without reading the wonderful story?Corn in Egypt there was then. Corn in Egypt there has been in varying quantity each year since. Corn in Egypt there is today. I saw some of it stored in the house of the Egyptian arab to whom my visit was paid yesterday. The many coloured coat has left its mark upon the page of time. Joseph's brethern came to Egypt by the same route through the land of the Philistines, as did the Turkish invaders who few weeks ago sought to cross the Suez Canal, in an attempt to become masters of this country. Adown the intervening ages the same road has been used by all and sundry, those who desired to get from Asia Minor to the north of Africa. As did Jacob 46-6. "And they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him."
