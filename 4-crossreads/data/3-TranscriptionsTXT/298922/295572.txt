Alex:Now Friday is given as the day we may get a boat. No boy ever looked forward to his Xmas Holidays as keenly as I do to this journey home. I will post this the day I sail - it will be 2 weeks from date my leave was granted - however it is better than the Front line & I'm not a bit keen to return there at present whatever I may be later on.  My Bronchitis is chronic & I get bad fits of coughing, a dry climate away from the sea is the one that agrees with me.
