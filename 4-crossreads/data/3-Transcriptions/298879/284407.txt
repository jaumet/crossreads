<p>July 1915<br/>Saturday 17<br/>Hot and Dusty still. A shower of rain just now would be very acceptable. This continuous fine hot weather together with the fly pest is extremely un comfortable</p>
<p>Sunday 18<br/>Blowy and hot. Got up a bit late this morning. Am usually up about 5.30 AM. Our bell tents are not very cool. So far we have been using mules in the carts brought either from England or India.</p>
