<p>blowing from the south all day &amp; the temp. was about 100-105&deg;.  The wind instead of dying down &ndash; as is usual &ndash; upon the approval of night, increased in violence until a gale was blowing which continued all night.<br/>Picture us &ndash; if you can- in a six x six dugout 2 feet down protected all around &amp; on top by sacking only.  The candle guttered &amp; wilted from the heat (we used three in as many hours).  The dust would blow in through the sacking like slow puffs of smoke and settle on everything.<br/>Finally you had to lie with the lightest clothes on &amp; get covered with dust or else get under a blanket &amp; sweat.<br/>It was so hot &amp; stuffy &amp; dark that it was impossible to tell without feeling whether one had a blanket over one's head or not.  I got about 3 hours doze &amp; then woke &amp; got up about 5 a.m. with eyes, ears &amp; nose full of dust &amp; found a layer an inch thick over everything.  We moved about 400 yds. today to a new camp on sand &amp; mercifully the wind &amp; heat have ceased.</p>
