1916   FRIDAY 21   APRIL
I wish to be simple, honest, natural, frank, clean in mind & clean in body, unaffected - ready to say "I do not know," if so it be, to meet all men on an absolute equality - to face any obstacle & meet every difficulty unafraid & un abashed. I wish to live without hate, whim, jealously, envy, or fear. I wish others to live their lives too - up to their highest, fullest, & best. To that end I pray that I may never meddle, dictate, interfere, or give advice that is not wanted, no assist when my services are not needed. If I can help people, I will do it by giving them a chance to help themselves, and if I can uplift or inspire, let it be by example, inference & suggestion, rather than by injunction & dictation.
Elbert Hubbard
