 Since his advent we have had a much easier time, Major Prince being a better friend to  the band than C.R.  Last night there was a Zep. Scare and every light in the camp was  extinguished.  We think we saw a Zep but as there is nothing in the papers regarding it,  it is improbable. We had to hand in all our surplus clothing and kit bags last night.  I don't suppose we will  ever see them again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Farewell concert in dining room at 8.  Brigadier &amp; 8 colonels present to present  prizes won at Brigade Sports.
