10 - to be with us instead of roaming the streets drinking & carousing.Their conversation was really quite interesting. Cairns discoursed on how he thought men mostly did great things or wrote great works by doing manual labor, and studying and living alone etc. etc.After we had lunch at the Continental hotel with Geoffry Street. He looks very much thinner but very well. Capt McKenzie - (Bondi dairy people) was at lunch also an officer of the 1st Batt. I met him in the Ivanhoe at London on crutches. It was very sad being with the Street boy without his O.C. Major Coultman. I feel his death very much - he was such a fine man. Geoffry told us about his illness. He went down to Tel el Kebir with his men and developed pneumonia there. He was brought to 2 Gen Hosp at Cairo where he died. I got the no. of his grave from Geoff and I'm going to see it and put flowers there. Geoffry
