<p>1917 October 17<br/>Murmuring "gutsen" we returned to our equipment and replaced our empty dixies in their covers. The train arrived at length and having packed in, about 8 to a carriage, which is quite enough when there is equipment concerned in the matter, the engine started.<br/>We stopped at Salisbury for a few minutes and then ran straight through. The scenery was very much like that around Hurdcott and we did not bother much about it till we neared Southampton. The train ran through the town and onto the docks. These are fenced off from the town by a high wall with gates at intervals. The gates were closely guarded by military police and Tommies everyone coming in or going out had top produce a pass and all wagons and other vehicles were closely scrutinised.. we dumped our equipment in a large shed on a wharf and some others and myself were unfortunate enough to be picked for gate</p>
