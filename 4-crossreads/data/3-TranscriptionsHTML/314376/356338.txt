<p>at the Vacuum Oil Coy. I also met my brother Bert who arrived in the 12th reinforcements of the 19th Battn. I remember the night of his arrival. The reinforcements which he arrived with were billetted about 2 miles from my Battalion. I set out, found the reinforcements but not Bert. Had my trip for nothing after all. I believe he too had a trip without result. He came down to me, reached the tent alright, but I was away. We saw one another for a time until one day he went on a Cairo picquet shortly afterwards being drafted away to England.</p>
