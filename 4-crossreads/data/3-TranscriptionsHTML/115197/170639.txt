<p><u>June 6th</u></p>
<p>Before noon our &quot;transport&quot; passes beetween Cape Verde &amp; C. Verde Islands.&nbsp; Unfortunately we see neither - nor have we seen land since leaving England.&nbsp; The study of &quot;English Grammar&quot;.</p>
<p>In the evening we are very happy to behold the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;in the sky.</p>
<p>Before turning in I have&nbsp;a little relaxation in the deck swimming tank.</p>
