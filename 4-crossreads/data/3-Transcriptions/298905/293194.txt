<p>The streets in London are quite dark of a night for all lights are shaded on account of the Zeppelin's. I have not seen a single bit of damage so far that they have caused I expected to find London in a more or less patchy state but all the damage they have done is trifling compared to what is claimed by them. It has been raining practically all day today.<br/>13th. Another dull day, this is one of the wettest summers London has had since 1903 this morning I am going to Burlington House Academy to have a look at the pictures there. Saw Digby this morning.<br/>I picked up with a New Zealander down the street this morning &amp; he &amp; I went &amp; had a good look</p>
