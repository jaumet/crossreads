<p>4 December<br/>Saturday<br/>Soldiering here at present consists of endless watching &amp; snipers &amp; Pick &amp; Shovel gangs, digging SAPS, trenches, &amp; Dug out &ndash; About the only Parade we have is our Rifle Inspections. We are on half Rations, but the men are cheerful; &amp; arrangements are being made to get a Canteen going on the Beach &ndash;<br/>The YMCA have been struggling for some time to run one but Freight from the Islands has been the trouble; the YMCA is a boon to the Soldiers giving them occasional Paper &amp; envelopes, <strike>but not much else. The Allies are a wasteful people compared to the Germans &amp; go in for much more luxury for their Soldiers.</strike></p>
