<p>Saturday 6 October 1917<br/>Rain &amp; gusty day.<br/>Our boat begins to roll once more but no swell.  Still we sail N.W., sun now sets well to port side &amp; up towards nose of boat.<br/>Drawing animal competition held 8 p.m.  Animals wonderful &amp; awful.  As usual most of competitors told each other before guessing time thus rendering "we's" out of the running.<br/>Today we crossed the equator, moderately cool with showers &amp; strong head wind blowing.<br/>Having a sense of humor helps one immensely as for instance &ndash; one sister tells me she is cousin to Lady Warwick or thereabouts &amp; is holder of letter from F. Nightingale.  2 others (just trained) lay down the law about private nursing, tact, etc., &amp; are "bored stiff" by diagnosing their friends diseases.  One listens &amp; wonders.</p>
