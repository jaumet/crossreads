All I've seen reminds me of North Qld  =  There are fertile patches for sugar - bananas - Citrus fruits & Coco plantations  -  there are fine plantations to be seen all round  -  The Union Jack stands for freedom, justice & fair play & colonists of any race will prosper under us  -  This may sound high falutin but I feel &  we all feel very strongly that 'this bit of the world belongs to us' & we want peace & plenty in it  -  There are 2 Jap flags - a red ball on a white ground - 'A fried egg Sailors call it' flying at the fore peak of 2 schooners  -  They are our allies  -  A Chinese flag   -  horizontal stripes - yellow, white, blue, red - flies close by  -  You bet I'm looking round, talking & getting any amount of jolly experience  -  It's a man's game & these chaps are men & real good chaps  -  You shd  see a bally contraption made on board to slide a torpedo into the sea & let her fly in case we'd been bailed up  -  The Protector wd not be much good & so these chaps determined to try & have a slap on their own  -
