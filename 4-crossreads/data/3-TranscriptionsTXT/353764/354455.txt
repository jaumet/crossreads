 24.4.16 Easter Monday Things are very much the same, that is plenty of hard work to get the Camp straightened out &amp; I am feeling very tired. I received 6 letters to day from home all addressed to my new Unit &amp; was exceedingly fortunate as all those who did not Cable their new address did not receive any as their letters have gone to the new 20th which is in France. The Weather continues to grow warmer &amp; in the middle of the day it is practically unbearable. 
 A strange thing is the unquenchable thirst that seizes everyone, &amp; the unfortunate part is that we are not allowed to drink much water on account of disease &amp; practically live on Lemonade &amp; Shandies &amp; very seldom drink plain water.  Lots of our chaps are going down to sickness &amp; at the present time there are 30 in Hospital. Tomorrow is a big day in Egypt it being the Anniversary of the Landing.
