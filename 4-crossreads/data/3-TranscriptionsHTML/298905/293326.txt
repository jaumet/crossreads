<p>alway's strike me as being to much color &amp; tinsel about them.<br/>There is to be a feet inspection this afternoon to see how the boys are standing it.<br/>By Jove" you should see how these French girls work they are wonderful, they work from early morning till late at night, &amp; all sorts of work too, &amp; they are so neat &amp; tidy.<br/>This evening after tea I went for a walk through a small forest here that joins the town, it is a most beautiful little place the leaves are that thick that you cannot see the sun shining through &amp; the trees are very tall &amp; scarce a limb on them for 50 or 60 ft up the trunk there are roads running all through this pretty little reserve.<br/>The 4th Battalion came in tonight they were covered in white dust &amp; looked very tired &amp; done up</p>
